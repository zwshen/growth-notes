This episode is called “A Problem with a Restaurant Check,” or a restaurant “bill” (the little piece of paper that tells you how much money you have to pay).  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  I waved my hand to get the waiter’s attention.  Waiter:  Yes?  Leslie:  The check, please.  Waiter:  Would you like any dessert, or some tea or coffee?  Leslie:  No, just the check.  Thanks.  Waiter:  Here you are.  I’ll ring that up for you when you’re ready.  Leslie:  Thank you.  Oh, there seems to be a mistake on our bill.  We didn’t order this appetizer.  Waiter:  Let me check this and I’ll be right back...Here you are.  I’ve adjusted the check.  I took off the appetizer.    Leslie:  Thanks, but there still seems to be a problem.  We had a two-for-one coupon, but we’ve been charged for both meals.
