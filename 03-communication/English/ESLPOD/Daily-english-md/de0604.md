I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Harming a Professional Reputation.”  “To harm” means to damage.  One’s “reputation” is what other people think of you.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Alex:  Good morning.  What’s with the gloom and doom?  Paige:  Have you seen this morning’s newspaper?  Alex:  No, I haven’t.    Paige:  You’d better read this.  It’s an article about our company.  Alex:  Let me see that.  This is outrageous!  How can anybody print such lies?  We’re not on the verge of going under.  How did they get a hold of so much misleading and outright wrong information?  Paige:  What I’m irate about is what it says about you, as the owner.  The article is full of innuendos about your background.  It’s nothing short of character assassination.  We’ll sue the paper for defamation of character.  Alex:  I’m not worried about my personal reputation.  I’m more concerned about the company’s image.  I’m going down to that paper and making them print a retraction.
