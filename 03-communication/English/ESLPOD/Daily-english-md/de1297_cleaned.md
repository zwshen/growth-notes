# Types of Neighborhoods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,297 – Types of Neighborhoods. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,297. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

This episode is a dialogue between Shari and Ron ab out different kinds of neighborhoods, or sections in a city, and what we c all them. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Shari: Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up  several for you to view this afternoon. 

Ron: Yes, I’m ready. It’s hard finding just the rig ht type of neighborhood to move to. 

Shari: Yes, it’s been difficult, hasn’t it? How lon g have I been showing you homes? 

Ron: About three months. 

Shari: That’s right. First we looked at homes in pl anned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city, as you requested.  

Ron: That’s right. At first, I thought I wanted a q uiet place to live in my retirement. 

Shari: That’s why I also showed you homes in retire ment communities. 

Ron: Yes, but once I saw them, I changed my mind. I ’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted a livelier neighborhood, somepla ce with more action. 

Shari: That’s why I showed you homes in the histori c district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very  pedestrian-friendly. 

Ron: Yes, but the more I thought about it, the more  I wanted to be in the middle of the action. 

Shari: That’s why, today, I’m taking you to the urb an core. We’ll look at homes in the downtown area, the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves. We’ll visit some high-priced neighborhoods and some up-and-comi ng. 

Ron: Great! I think house-hunting has given me a ne w lease on life. This is fun! I could look at home after home after home. 

Shari: That’s what I’m afraid of. 

[end of dialogue] 

Shari begins by saying to Ron, “Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up several for you to view this afternoon.” “To line u p” or “to have lined up” means to plan and make ready or to schedule. In this case, w e have Shari, who we learn is a real estate agent. She’s a person responsible for  finding homes for someone to buy or rent. She has “organized” or scheduled some houses to show to Ron, who is looking for a house to buy or rent. I think he’s  buying a house.  

Ron says, “I’m ready.” I’m ready to view or look at  the houses that Shari has lined up for him to see. He says, “It’s hard finding just  the right type of neighborhood to move to.” A “neighborhood” is an area within a city . Most large cities have several different sections, parts, or what we would  call “neighborhoods” – areas that usually are given a name. For example, here in  Los Angeles, Hollywood is actually a neighborhood within the city of Los Ange les. It’s not its own city. It’s part of the larger city. Venice is a neighborhood i n Los Angeles, and there are many different neighborhoods here.  

Well, Ron is finding it difficult to know what kind  of neighborhood he wants to move to. He’s been looking for a house for three mo nths now. We learn from Shari that first, she and Ron looked at homes in “p lanned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city.” A “community” is another word for a neighborhood or area. 

Sometimes “community” is used in a larger, more gen eral sense to refer to a large group of people who have similar backgrounds or live in a similar area, but here it refers to an area in a city. Although, it c ould also be used to refer to a single city. Here in Southern California, there are  “planned communities” that are their own city. Irvine, California, which is in the  southern part of Southern California, if that makes any sense, is a “planned community.”  

A planned community is one where someone has sat do wn and decided where everything is going to be. In other words, it wasn’ t a small town that grew little by  

little over many years. Instead, there was someone who had a plan who drew out were all the streets were going to be, and where th e houses were going to be, and the parks, and the schools, and so on. Planned communities are often built at once – that is, the entire area, neighborhood, o r even city is built all over a short period of time, a couple of years even.  

There are planned communities inside of cities. The re are also “gated (gated) communities.” A gated community is usually a group of homes that is surrounded by a fence or a wall to provide protection and secu rity for the people who live in that neighborhood. There is often a gate, an entran ce that you have to stop at and get permission in order to continue driving int o the community. The gate is typically on one of the larger streets that go into  that community.  

We have gated communities here in Los Angeles, espe cially where very rich people live. There are gated communities just north  of where I live. I live where the poor people live, and the rich people live up i n the gated communities. Hollywood stars, movie stars, those sorts of folks are the ones that live in the gated communities here in L.A. 

Shari also refers to “bedroom (bedroom) communities .” The “bedroom” is the area or the room in the house where you sleep, wher e you have your bed of course. “Bedroom communities,” however, refer to sm all towns that are next to a large city, where many people move to when they don ’t want to live in the city itself – perhaps because the city is too expensive,  or maybe it’s not safe, or perhaps the schools aren’t very good in the cities – and so people who work in the city live outside of the city in what are calle d “bedroom communities.”  

These are often simply called “suburbs,” although a  suburb could be another city with something more than just houses. Bedroom commu nities are areas where there are mainly houses. There isn’t a lot of busin ess that you will find in a bedroom community. Los Angeles has lots of bedroom communities – towns that are outside of the city of Los Angeles where you wi ll find mostly homes. There aren’t a lot of large businesses there. Ron says th at he thought he wanted a quiet place to live “in his retirement.” “Retirement” is the period after you leave your job, usually when you are older.  

Shari says, “That’s why I also showed you homes in retirement communities.” Yes, there are actually areas in the city, or in fa ct entire cities, that have mostly retired people in them. This concept, this idea, be came very popular in the 1970s, I guess 1980s also, where in the southern, e specially southwestern United States, as well as in Florida, in the southe ast part of the country, there  

were small cities built mostly for retired people, for older people, who wanted a place where it would be quiet.  

Ron says he thought he wanted to live in a retireme nt community, but once he saw them, he changed his mind – that is, he decided  he was wrong and had a different idea. He says, “I’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted to live in a livelier neighborhood, someplace with more action .” “Livelier” (livelier) comes from the adjective “lively,” which means there are perhaps a lot of people there, or there are things going on. There are small busin esses and restaurants and cafes. That would be a “livelier area” of the city,  or a “livelier neighborhood.” 

Shari says, “That’s why I showed you homes in the h istoric district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very  pedestrian-friendly.” “Historic (historic) district (district)” refers to an area i n a city or town that is important for some reason. Often it’s the older part of town. A h istoric part of Los Angeles is the area near downtown where the first Spanish sett lers came back many hundreds of years ago. That’s the historic part of the city. The word “district” simply refers to an area within the city or within a town.  

Shari also showed Ron the “redeveloped waterfront a rea.” The “waterfront” (waterfront) is obviously an area in the city next to some water. It could be a river. It could be a lake. It could be the ocean. “Redevel oped” means that it was an area that was perhaps old and had old buildings, or  buildings that people weren’t using anymore, and someone came and put new buildin gs there or they fixed up, they repaired, the old buildings so that people cou ld now live and work there. Many cities have redeveloped their waterfront areas , especially those in the older cities in the eastern part of the U.S. 

Shari says that these areas that she showed Ron – t he historic district and the waterfront area – are both very “pedestrian (pedest rian) – friendly (friendly).” “Pedestrian” is a word we use to describe someone w ho walks, or someone who is walking along the street. So “pedestrian-friendl y” would be an area where it’s easy to walk up and down. There are some parts of t he city that are not pedestrian friendly, especially here in Los Angeles , but nobody walks in Los Angeles anyway so it doesn’t really matter.  

Ron says, “Yes, the more I thought about it, the mo re I wanted to be in the middle of the action.” “In the middle of the action ” means where lots of things are happening – an area, in this case, where there are a lot of people, a lot of excitement perhaps. Shari says, “That’s why, today,  I’m taking you to the urban core” (core). “Urban” (urban) refers to the city. T he “urban core” of the city would  

be the main or central part of a large city, not th e bedroom communities, not the suburbs. The opposite of that.  

“We’ll look at homes in the downtown area,” Shari s ays, “the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves.” “Downtown” refers to th e main, central, usually business section of the city. It’s often, but not a lways, the older part of the city. The downtown area in Los Angeles is in fact the old est part of the city.  

Shari’s also going to show Ron houses in the “arts (arts) district.” In some American cities, there are areas where there are a lot of artists who live, perhaps because the rents are cheaper, since artists normal ly don’t make a lot of money. The arts district is often an area that has cheaper  places to stay but is also an exciting area because there are a lot of artists th ere – painters and sculptors and other people who call themselves artists.  

Shari’s also going to show Ron houses in a few “eth nic (ethnic) enclaves (enclaves).” An “enclave” is a small area within th e city with people who come from the same country, cultural background, or perh aps speak the same language. These are often areas with “immigrants” –  people who’ve come from other countries, since the United States is, for th e most part, a nation of immigrants.  

“Ethnic” is an interesting word. “Ethnic” refers of ten to the country or region of the world from which you come or your ancestors – the p eople who first came to the United States – were from. So, I have Irish ethnici ty. I would say that’s my ethnic group. And there were, especially in cities such as  Boston, New York, Chicago, and my hometown, St. Paul, ethnic areas where the I rish lived. There were other “ethnic enclaves” where the Germans lived. So the w ord “ethnic” means national origin or sometimes regional origin.  

Interestingly, the word “ethnic” has changed over t he years when we talk about politics. Back in the late ’70s, early 1980s, when people talked about the “ethnic vote,” they were referring mainly to southern and e astern European voters or those who are descendants of immigrants from those countries. Nowadays we tend to use the term to refer more to, say, those w ho are from Latin America or from Asia. But the term is a general one that can a pply to any nationality.  

Shari says, “We’ll visit some high-priced neighborh oods and some up-and- coming.” The expression “up-and-coming” means that the area is getting more popular, more people are moving there. Ron says, “G reat! I think house-hunting has given me a new lease on life.” “House-hunting” refers to the process of looking for a house, usually to buy. The expression  “a new lease (lease) on life”  

 means a new reason to feel happy to live, especiall y perhaps after you’ve had a difficult time in your life, or perhaps you’ve lost  someone or simply have grown older.  

“A new lease on life” would give you a feeling of e xcitement, some new reason to live. Ron thinks that this is fun, this house-hunti ng. He says, “I could look at home after home after home.” In other words, he would lo ve to continue just looking at houses, not actually buying one.” Shari says, “That ’s what I’m afraid of.” Remember, Shari is a real estate agent. Her job is to find a house for Ron, but she doesn’t want to continue showing him houses for ever. She wants to get paid, and she only gets paid when Ron actually buys a hou se.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
