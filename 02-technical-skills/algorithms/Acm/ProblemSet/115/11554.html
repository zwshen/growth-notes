>Bob collects sticks in a peculiar way. He will only accept a new stick into his collection if its length is exactly length <I>n</I> + 1 cm where <I>n</I> is the number of sticks currently in his collection. This implies his collection of <I>n</I> sticks contains exactly one stick of length 1 cm through <I>n </I>cm. </P

>One day Alice visited Bob to inspect his stick collection (upon Bob&rsquo;s insistence of course). Alice wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested in Bob&rsquo;s excessive descriptions and needed a quick conversation changer. Cleverly, she posed the following question to Bob: &ldquo;If you are allowed to take any 3 sticks from your collection, how many different triangles can you make?&rdquo; </P
><P 

>Can you help Bob answer the question so he can get back to telling Alice about his sticks? </P
