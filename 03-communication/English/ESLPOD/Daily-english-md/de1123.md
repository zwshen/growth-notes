[start of dialogue]

Kitty: Oh, smell that. Isn’t that delectable?

Pepe: Yes, it’s pleasant.

Kitty: Pleasant? It’s heavenly. It has a nice fruit y scent, not too sweet.

Pepe: If you say so. I don’t want to buy anything t hat has a strong perfume smell. I’m a guy.

Kitty: I know, but you want to exude a sexy scent t hat captivates the opposite sex, right?

Pepe: I’m not sure about that. I just want to smell  fresh and clean.

Kitty: All right, how about this one?

Pepe: Uh, it smells musky.

Kitty: Musky is good. Musky is sexy.

Pepe: Not to me. Let’s stick with something basic. I’m buying this one.

Kitty: But that one smells like detergent!

Pepe: Yes, because that’s what I’m buying – deterge nt for my clothes. I don’t need any fancy scents on my clothes.

Kitty: Have it your way, but you’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.

Pepe: I’ll pass up that chance, thank you very much . If I follow your advice and buy this perfume-smelling detergent, women will def initely get the wrong idea about me!

Kitty begins our dialogue by saying to Pepe, “Oh, s mell that.” “To smell,” of course, means to breathe air into your nose so you can get the flavor of something or the “scent” (scent) of something. The scent of something is the way it smells, especially if it smells good. We often t alk about, say, perfume for a woman as having a certain scent. Kitty says, “The s mell is delectable” (delectable). “Delectable” is another word for “del icious” – something that has a very good taste.

Pepe says, “Yes, it’s pleasant” (pleasant). “Pleasa nt” means nice. It means comfortable, but it isn’t a very strong compliment.  It isn’t a very strong idea. If you say something is pleasant, you mean it’s okay – it’ s nice, but it’s not great. That’s why Kitty is surprised. She says, “Pleasant? It’s h eavenly.” “Heavenly” refers to something that is perfect, something that is really  good.

She says, “It has a nice fruity scent, not too swee t.” “Fruity” (fruity) refers to the tastes and smells of fruit. Kitty is describing som ething as having a “fruity scent, not too sweet.” We usually think of fruit as being sweet, as having certain sugars in it that make it sweet. Pepe says, “If you say so .” We’ve heard this expression before. When someone says, “If you say so,” he’s re ally saying, “I don’t agree with you, but I’m not going to argue with you, eith er.”

Pepe says, “I don’t want to buy anything that has a  strong perfume smell.” “Perfume” (perfume) is a kind of scented liquid tha t a woman sprays on her body to make her smell good. Men don’t normally wear per fume, or at least they don’t call it perfume. The word “perfume” in English only  refers to the liquid that a woman would put on her body. Pepe says he doesn’t w ant anything that smells like perfume. “I’m a guy,” he says – I’m a man.

Kitty says, “I know, but you want to exude a sexy s cent that captivates the opposite sex.” “To exude” (exude) means to convey o r display. It’s for something

to be sent out from your body. You could say that a  certain person “exudes confidence.” It’s almost as though the confidence w ere a scent that was coming out of the person’s body. The idea is that it’s ver y obvious. If you exude confidence, you are a very confident person. You lo ok confident. Well, here we’re not talking about confidence, we’re talking about a  “sexy scent.” “Sexy” (sexy) refers to things that people consider sexually attr active.

Kitty wants Pepe to have a “sexy scent that captiva tes the opposite sex.” “To captivate” (captivate) means to get someone’s atten tion so that he or she can’t concentrate on anything else. You may see a beautif ul woman and find her beauty captivating. You can’t focus on anything els e. Of course, I’m referring to your wife or girlfriend. Kitty is trying to get Pep e to captivate the opposite sex. The term “opposite sex” refers to, for a woman, a m an, and for a man, a woman.

Pepe is a little doubtful. He says, “I’m not sure a bout that. I just want to smell fresh and clean.” “To smell fresh” (fresh) means the same as to smell new or clean – not dirty in this case. Kitty says, “All ri ght, how about this one?” Pepe says, “Uh, it smells musky” (musky). “Musky” means having the scent of a male animal. Some people think it’s a pleasant smell, so me people don’t. Kitty thinks it is. She says, “Musky is good. Musky is sexy.” It’s how a man should smell, according to Kitty.

Pepe says, however, “Not to me,” meaning it isn’t g ood for me. “Let’s stick with something basic.” “To stick with” something means t o concentrate or focus on – to not try other things. He says, “I’m buying this one.” Kitty, however, says, “But that one smells like detergent!” “Detergent” (deter gent) is soap that you use to wash either clothing or dishes. Pepe says, “Yes, be cause that’s what I’m buying – detergent for my clothes.” Now we learn what Pepe  is actually buying at the store. He’s buying detergent to wash his clothes.

He adds, “I don’t need any fancy scents on my cloth es,” meaning he doesn’t need his clothes to smell of something. Kitty says,  “Have it your way.” That’s an expression we use to indicate that the other person  should just do what he or she wants, but that you would do something different. Y ou are expressing disagreement with the other person, but telling the  other person to go ahead and do what he or she wants to do.

There was actually a commercial when I was growing up for one of the big hamburger restaurants – not McDonald’s, but Burger King. Burger King had advertisements that tried to emphasize that if you went to Burger King you could get your hamburger made however you wanted it.

Have it your way, have it your way at Burger King.

I remember that. That was from, like, the 1970s. Ca n you believe that? Anyway that’s how effective advertising can be, you see. Y ou get that song in your head and you can’t get rid of it, right? Even after 40 y ears.

Well, back to the story. Pepe doesn’t want to buy t he detergent that Kitty likes. Kitty says to him, “You’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.” “To miss out on” something is not to have t he opportunity to do something, especially because you’ve made a certain  decision. If you’re going to miss out on the party, you’re going to not have fun  at the party with everyone else because you’ve decided not to go. You’re going  to miss out. You’re going to lose the opportunity to do something good or positi ve.

Kitty thinks that Pepe will miss out on the chance,  the opportunity, to lure women. “To lure” (lure) means to bring someone closer to y ou by offering the person something attractive or rewarding. It could also be  used for an animal. “To lure an animal” would be to get an animal to come close to you, perhaps because you want to capture the animal. When we’re talking abou t humans, we often use this verb when we’re describing making yourself attracti ve to another romantic partner or to someone who you would like to be your  romantic partner.

Pepe, however, says, “I’ll pass up that chance.” “T o pass up” something, or “to pass something up,” means to decide not to do somet hing or to have something. He says, “If I follow your advice and buy this perf ume-smelling detergent, women will definitely get the wrong idea about me.” He’s saying that women will think something different about him than what, I guess, K itty thinks women will think about him. It’s confusing. I know.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Kitty: Pleasant? It’s heavenly. It has a nice fruit y scent, not too sweet.
