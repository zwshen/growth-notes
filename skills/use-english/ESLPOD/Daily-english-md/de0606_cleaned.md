# Reading a Bus Schedule

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 606: Reading a Bus Schedule.    This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 606.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide including a complete transcript of everything we say.  This episode is called “Reading a Bus Schedule.”  It’s a dialogue between Louisa and Curt about how you read the “schedule,” the information about places and times, for a bus.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  This was my first visit to McQuillanville.  I wanted to avoid driving, so I decided to take the bus around the city.  However, I was having some trouble figuring out the bus schedule.  Louisa:  Excuse me, could you help me read this bus schedule?  Curt:  I can try.  Where do you want to go?  Louisa:  I want to go downtown, but I’m not sure which bus to take.  Curt:  Let me see that bus schedule.  Here’s a listing of the route numbers on the back of this schedule.  Look for a bus that goes downtown.  Louisa:  Oh, I see.  That’s great.  Tomorrow, I want to arrive at the Podcast Museum at 10 a.m. when it opens.  Which bus will I have to take?  Curt:  Let me look at this bus schedule.  That’s simple.  All you have to do is find the stop closest to the museum, then look down the column to find the arrival time of 10 a.m. or before, and work backwards to see what time that bus passes the stop at your starting point.  Got it?
