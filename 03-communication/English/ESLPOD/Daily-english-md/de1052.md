This episode is a dialogue between Melissa and Lee about a company that made something with a problem and had to get people to s end it back to them in order to fix it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa: This is a disaster! If we have to recall 1 00,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.

Lee: We have no choice. The product defect poses a safety hazard. If we don’t act quickly, we’ll have a huge liability issue on o ur hands.

Melissa: I think we’re blowing this out of proporti on. Only a small amount of our June product run was affected.

Lee: Yes, but even one case of someone getting hurt  because of the defect would be a PR nightmare, and that’s on top of the c harges of negligence we’d have to face in court. We need to get ahead of this  now.

Melissa: All right, all right. I guess we have no c hoice. Should we hold a press conference to announce the recall?

Lee: We’ll send out a press release first and then hold a press conference.

Melissa: I’m putting you in charge of it. Get it do ne.

Lee: You mean in charge of getting the press releas e sent out?

Melissa: I mean that and the press conference. You can face the press and answer their questions.

Lee: You’re throwing me to the wolves?

Melissa: Not at all. I’m helping you raise your pro file in the company. You should be thanking me.

Lee: Somehow I don’t feel so grateful.

The topic on this episode is a product recall. A “p roduct” is a thing, usually a physical thing, that companies produce and sell. Ju st about anything physical can be a product: a computer, a microphone, a piece  of paper – all of these are products. We often distinguish between products, wh ich are typically physical, and “services.” A “service” would be, for example, something a lawyer might do for you. The lawyer isn’t selling you anything. The  lawyer is charging you for his services (and quite a bit, I’m sure).

In this dialogue, Melissa begins by saying, “This i s a disaster.” A “disaster” (disaster) is a crisis, a major problem that will b e difficult to solve or recover from. There are “natural disasters” like earthquakes, hur ricanes, and floods, as well as “man-made disasters” – things that humans cause.

Melissa says, “If we have to recall 100,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.” “To recall” (recall) here refers to a company that makes something, a product, that has a problem, and it has to ask the people wh o bought the product to return the product back to the company so they can get a n ew product, one that works correctly, or to get a “refund” – their money back.  The verb “to recall” can also mean to remember, but here it means something very different.

Melissa says that they will “take a huge loss this year.” A “loss” (loss) is when you spend more money than you bring in. A loss woul d be the opposite of profits. “Profit” is when you make money. A loss is when you  lose money. Lee says, “We have no choice,” meaning we don’t have any other op tion. We have to do it. “The product defect poses a safety hazard.” A “product d efect” (defect) is a problem in the product or a problem with the product.

So, for example, if you make a car and the brakes of the car don’t work properly, don’t work correctly, that would be a good example of a product defect. It would also be a good example of a product defect that pos es a safety hazard. The word

“poses” (poses) here just means presents or causes to happen. A “safety hazard” (hazard) is something that could hurt you or possib ly even kill you.

Lee says, “If we don’t act quickly,” meaning if we don’t do something right now, “we’ll have a huge liability issue on our hands.” “ Liability” (liability) refers to your responsibility, especially your financial responsib ility in case something goes wrong. When Lee says, “We’ll have a huge liability issue,” he means that the company may have to pay out a lot of money to peopl e, especially if people get hurt from their product.

He says we will have this “huge liability issue on our hands.” The expression “on our hands” or “on your hands” means belonging to so meone, especially when we’re talking about responsibility for a problem. I f you’re working on a project at work and suddenly you discover a big problem, you m ight say to your boss, “We have a problem on our hands,” meaning we have a pro blem here. Lee thinks they’ll have a liability problem if they don’t reca ll the product.

Melissa says, “I think we’re blowing this out of pr oportion.” “To blow (blow) something out of proportion (proportion)” means to act as if something were bigger or more important or more serious than it ac tually is. The other word we would use here would be “overreact” (overreact). “T o overreact” is to blow things out of proportion, to make them seem as if they wer e bigger problems than they actually are.

Melissa says, “Only a small amount of our June prod uct run was affected.” A “product run” would be a number of units that were made at the same time, that were manufactured at the same time. Melissa is sayi ng that the defect in the product is only affecting a small number of the pro ducts that they made.

Lee says, “Yes, but even one case,” or one example,  “of someone getting hurt because of the defect would be a PR nightmare.” “PR ” stands for “public relations,” and here it refers to the publicity or the reputation of the company. A “nightmare” is a bad dream. We sometimes use it to describe a terrible situation. Lee continues, “And that’s on top of the charges of  negligence we’d have to face in court.” “On top of” here means in addition to.

So, in addition to the PR nightmare, Lee says, ther e will also be charges of negligence. “Negligence” (negligence) is a term oft en used in the law to refer to the failure of someone to take care of someone or s omething that he is responsible for, especially if that failure results  in or causes harm or even death. “Negligence” refers to a situation where you don’t want to harm someone, but you do things that harm someone, things that you sh ould have not done or that

you should have known not to do. Lee says the compa ny will have to face charges of negligence in court.

He says, “We need to get ahead of this now.” “To ge t ahead of” something means to say and do whatever is necessary so that y ou can control a situation, a situation that is perhaps getting worse. Melissa sa ys, “All right, all right. I guess we have no choice. Should we hold a press conferenc e to announce the recall?” A “press (press) conference” is an event to which y ou invite reporters from television stations or newspapers in order to make a big announcement, in order to say something important about your company and i ts actions.

Melissa is suggesting they hold a press conference.  Notice the verb “hold” is used, especially when we are talking about press co nferences. Lee says, “We’ll send out a press release first and then hold a pres s conference.” A “press release” (release) is a document, either a piece of  paper or perhaps a PDF file, that you send news organizations like television st ations and newspapers and magazines, announcing something important about you r company.

Melissa says, “I’m putting you in charge of it,” me aning you have to do it. “Get it done,” she says. Lee says, “You mean in charge of g etting the press release sent out?” Melissa says, “I mean that and the press conf erence.” You can face the press and answer their questions. “To face” is used  once again here to mean to have to deal with a difficult situation or to have to talk to and handle a certain group of people.

Lee says, “You’re throwing me to the wolves?” This expression “to throw (throw) someone to the wolves (wolves)” means to put someon e in a difficult situation, especially a situation that might be hostile and wh ere the person might have to answer difficult questions. “Wolves” is the plural of “wolf” (wolf), which is an animal, a sometimes dangerous animal. Lee is asking  if he is going to have to suffer, basically, for the mistakes that the compan y made by having to hold a press conference and talk to reporters.

Melissa says, “Not at all,” meaning “No, I’m not th rowing you to the wolves.” “I’m helping you raise your profile in the company. You should be thanking me.” “To raise (raise) your profile (profile)” means to do s omething so that other people notice you – to get attention, positive attention, from other people, especially in your company. Of course, Melissa isn’t trying to ra ise Lee’s profile by making him the person who has to do the press conference, but she acts as though that is what she were doing.

She even says, amazingly, “You should be thanking m e,” meaning that Lee should be grateful – should say thank you for this assignment, this task. Lee says, “Somehow I don’t feel so grateful.” “Grateful ” (grateful) means feeling thankful, wanting to express your thanks to someone . Lee doesn’t feel very grateful, very thankful, for having to do this job.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
