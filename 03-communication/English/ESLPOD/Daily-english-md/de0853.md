[start of dialog]

Ivy:  This is so sad!

Stephan:  What is?

Ivy:  I’m reading the obituary for one of my favori te actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.

Stephan:  Oh, yeah?

Ivy:  Yeah, and this article has really done him ju stice. It’s a nice tribute to a man who touched so many lives. It says here that he’s s urvived by his wife and five children.

Stephan:  Did he live to a ripe old age?

Ivy:  He was 97 when he died. There’ll be a memoria l service and funeral for him this Saturday. I think I’ll send some flowers.

Stephan:  Really? You didn’t know him personally, d id you?

Ivy:  No, but it would be nice to be part of the fu neral, in some small way. I wonder who’ll be giving the eulogies. I’m sure it’l l be somebody important.

Stephan:  If you say so. I’ve never heard of him. W as he on a children’s show or something?

Ivy:  You’ve never heard of Mr. McBoo?! Were you ra ised in a cave?

Stephan:  Not quite. We didn’t have a TV in the hom e when I was growing up.

Ivy:  Oh, you poor, poor man. You’ve been deprived of Mr. McBoo all your life. Don’t worry. I’ll fix that. I have all of his shows , so we can have a viewing marathon this weekend.

Stephan:  Lucky me.

Ivy begins by saying to Stephan, “This is so sad!” Stephan says, “What is?” Ivy says, “I’m reading the obituary of one of my favori te actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.” An “obituary” (obituary) is a  short article or a short notice, printed in a newspaper, or nowadays, on the Interne t, after someone dies, about that person. It will say the person’s name, usually , how old they were, the date they died, and something about them, who they were.

Ivy says that she’s reading the obituary of one of her favorite actors when she was young, a Mr. McBoo. “He had quite a life,” Ivy says. The expression “to have quite (quite) a life” means that it was an interest ing or exciting life. Stephan says, “Oh yeah?” Ivy says, “Yeah, and this article has re ally done him justice.” “To do someone or something justice” is to do something ve ry well, to be good enough for that something, to do what that someone or some thing deserves. So, if a book does someone justice, we mean it describes the m accurately, correctly. It does what it should do in describing the life of th at person. When I sing, I never do the song justice because I do a very bad job. So , you can use it in the negative as well. “It doesn’t do him justice.” Noti ce we use the verb “to do” – “to do (a person)” or “to do (a thing) justice (justice ).”

Ivy says, “It’s a nice tribute to a man who touched  so many lives.” A “tribute” (tribute) is something that is done or said to show  respect for someone or to something, to show admiration. Sometimes, when some one is very famous and they get old, they will have a tribute on televisio n to that person, where other people will stand up and they will talk about what a wonderful person that is. That’s a tribute. Ivy says that this obituary is a nice tribute to a man who “touched so many lives.” “To touch (touch) a life” means to affect someone, to have an impact on someone in a positive way.

 Ivy says, “It says here that he” – Mr. McBoo – “is survived by his wife and his five children.” The expression “to be survived by someon e” means that those are the people, usually your close relatives, who are still  living. So, if I die and my wife is still living, my obituary would say that I was surv ived by my wife. That’s the close relation of mine who is still living. So, if you are survived by someone, those are people who continue to live even though you have di ed, and typically, that would be a spouse (your wife, your husband), your childre n, maybe brothers and sisters, cousins, perhaps even parents if someone d ies young.

Stephan says, “Did he live to a ripe old age?” The expression “A ripe (ripe) old age” just means a very old age. Typically, we use t his expression when the person not only has lived a long time, but they wer e in pretty good health even when they were old. They could still think clearly.  They were still very much active. Ivy says, “He was 97 when he died. There’ll  be a memorial service and funeral for him this Saturday.” A “memorial service ” is usually an event where people come and they talk about the person who has died. They remember him. They share their own memories with other people. A “funeral” is typically a more formal event, often a religious event, where the bo dy is either taken to a church and there is some sort of religious ceremony held, and/or to a cemetery where the body is put into the ground. A “cemetery” (ceme tery) is a place where bodies are buried – after you die, of course.

Ivy says, “I think I’ll send some flowers.” It’s co mmon when someone dies, especially if you’re not able to go to the memorial  service or funeral yourself, to send flowers, and those flowers are usually put nex t to the body or somewhere in the room where the service is being held. Stephan s ays, “Really? You didn’t know him personally, did you?” When we say we know someone “personally,” we mean we have met that person. We have shook their h ands. We’ve talked to them. We knew them personally. I know who the presi dent of the United States is, but I don’t know him personally. He’s never com e to my house for dinner, which is probably a good thing because I don’t cook  very well.

Ivy says, “No” – no, I didn’t know him personally –  “but it would be nice to be part of the funeral in some small way. I wonder who’ll b e giving the eulogies.” A “eulogy” (eulogy) means a speech, usually delivered  or given at a funeral where the speaker says nice things about the person who d ied. Sometimes, this is a done by a religious official. Sometimes, it’s done by a member of the family. It really depends on the situation. Not all memorial s ervices or funerals have eulogies. Some do, some don’t.

Ivy says “I’m sure” the person who will be giving the eulogies will be “somebody important.” Stephan says, “If you say so.” This exp ression, “If you say so,” is used when you don’t really believe what the other p erson has said, but you don’t want to fight with them. You don’t want to argue wi th them. Someone may say, “Oh, this is the best Mexican food I’ve ever eaten! ” and you go, “Well, if you say so,” meaning you don’t really agree. You don’t thin k it’s very good, but you don’t want to argue with the person.

Stephan says, “I’ve never heard of him [of Mr. McBo o]. Was he on a children’s show or something?” “Was he on a show that was for children?” The phrase “or something” means “or something else” – something si milar. Ivy says, “You’ve never heard of Mr. McBoo!? Were you raised in a cav e?” A “cave” (cave) is a large covered space, usually in a mountain or some other rocky area, some other hilly area, maybe even underground, that is often the home for certain animals. A “cave” is sort of like part of a mountain or a hill  or in the ground that has been carved out, often through water going through it, o r some other process over a long period of time. The expression, “Were you rais ed in cave,” however, really means “Did you grow up without any contact with the  rest of the world?” It’s sort of a criticism, a funny way of saying, “How could y ou not know about this person?” Only someone who grew up in the middle of the forest or on an island or in a cave would not have heard of this person be cause he’s so famous. That’s the idea.

Stephan responds to Ivy, “Not quite,” meaning no, I  didn’t grow up in a cave. “We didn’t have a TV in the home when I was growing up. ” So, he didn’t have a television in his house. That’s not very common any more, but it’s possible. Ivy says, “Oh, you poor, poor man.” She’s sort of being  funny here – “You poor,” meaning unfortunate, “man.” “You’ve been deprived of Mr. McBoo all your life.” “To deprive” (deprive) means not to let someone hav e something that is necessary or perhaps is very enjoyable. Stephan has  been deprived of Mr. McBoo. He hasn’t been able to find out about Mr. Mc Boo his entire life.

“Don’t worry,” Ivy says, “I’ll fix that.” I’ll take  care of that situation. “I have all of his shows, so we can have a viewing marathon this weeke nd.” A “marathon” (marathon) is usually the word we use for a long ra ce, for people who are running. However, more recently, it has been used to describe when a television channel has many different episodes of the same sho w on, on a single day, or on a single weekend. So, if we have a holiday weekend,  a weekend where we have three days that we don’t work, one of those days mi ght be a television marathon of a popular show. Usually, these are shows that we re on a long time ago. So, in 2012, it would be, perhaps, shows like Star Trek or  Seinfeld or Friends. There

might be a marathon of those shows. So they show on e show and then another one and then another one, and so forth.

Ivy wants to have a marathon of the old Mr. McBoo s hows. Stephan says, “Lucky me.” This expression is used jokingly, sarcasticall y, we would say, to mean that you don’t feel very lucky. It means the opposite of  what it says. It all depends on how you say it, but usually, it’s used as a joke. W hen someone says, “Oh, lucky me,” they mean I don’t feel so lucky. I have to exp erience this thing, but I’m not really happy about it. Stephan is not happy about h aving to watch all of these old children shows, and I kind of agree with Stephan. M r. McBoo, by the way, is not a real person, was not a real actor, which means, of course, he didn’t really die.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
