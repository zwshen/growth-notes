This episode is a dialogue between Victoria and J.D.  It ’s going to talk about listening to music and uses a lot of vocabulary we use to d escribe music.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Victoria:  I see that you have a really extensive music colle ction. 

J.D.:  Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of music.   

Victoria:  Do you have the new J.McQ album?  He’s my favor ite artist.  I just got it and I like all of the tracks on it.   

J.D.:  No, I haven’t heard it yet.  Do you have it on yo ur MP3 player?   

Victoria:  Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track. 

J.D.:  Hmm…I like the beat of the first song, but I’m n ot blown away by the rest of it.  It’s also a really bad mix.  The bass is up too high ; you can hardly hear the treble.  Is the whole album like that? 

Victoria:  Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t notice.  Maybe the  volume wasn’t up high enough.   

J.D.:  No, it was up high enough.  Maybe he’s just not t hat good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mi xing. 

Victoria:  Are you kidding?  He’s an amazing singer.  Co me on, listen to another track.  I’m sure you’ll change your mind.  

 J.D.:  No, thanks.  I’d rather listen to a bunch of fi ghting cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!

Our dialogue begins with Victoria saying, “I see that you  have a really extensive music collection.”  “Extensive” means large, thorough, and complete, with many different kinds of something.  You might say to someone, “He has an extensive library,” it has lots of different books about lots of d ifferent topics.  A “collection” is just a group of things, so when Victoria says to J.D., “you  have a really extensive music collection,” she means he has a lot of albums, CDs, ot her recordings of music. 

J.D. says, “Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of mu sic.”  A “genre of music” is a type or a style of music; it can also be used to describe a t ype or a style of book or of a movie – different genres of movies.  Notice that  the person’s name here is J.D., those are actually initials.  Usually they would stand  for something: the “J” could be John or James or even Jeff.  Sometimes people use  their initials as, effectively, their name, and that’s what J.D. is using her e.  I actually have a friend whose first and last initials are “J” and “D,” sometimes p eople would call him J.D. 

Anyway, J.D. has a lot of different types of music.  Victor ia asks him, “Do you have the new J.McQ album?  He’s my favorite artist.”  An “album” is a group of songs on a single CD (or compact disc) or on what we used to call “records.” Well, they’re still called records; they’re not as popula r anymore, although some people still like them.  These were large black discs made out of vinyl.  An album is a collection of 8-10, maybe more songs from the same si nger or the same band.  The word “artist,” here, just means musician.  I t can be used to refer to someone who is a painter or a sculptor, but in talking about music it simply means the musician. 

Victoria says that J.McQ is he favor artist, and I can under stand why – he’s got a great voice!  She says, “I just got it (meaning I just bou ght it; I just was able to obtain it) and I liked all of the tracks on it.”  A “tr ack” is one song on an album, or one song in a collection of music in this case.  “Track” actu ally has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

J.D. says, “No, I haven’t heard it yet.  Do you have it on your MP3 player?” your iPod, for example.  Victoria says, “Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track.”  “To cue up (something)” means to make something ready to p lay, especially if you  

 are talking about music or videos.  For example, if you ha ve a DVD player and you rent a movie – a DVD, your husband or wife might say , “I’ll cue up the movie while you make the popcorn.”  “To cue up” means to get i t ready to play, because, of course, when you buy a DVD with a movie on i t there’s usually of bunch of other commercials and other things before the  movie actually starts. 

J.D. says, after listening to this song by J.McQ, he says, “Hmm …I like the beat of the first song, but I’m not blown away by the rest of i t.”  The “beat” (beat), here refers to the rhythm, the repeating regular song when you have one note stronger or louder than the other.  There are a lot of very famous beats in popular music, sometimes you even hear the same beat in different types of music – or different songs, I should say.  Well, J.D. likes the beat  of the first song, but he was not blown away by the rest of it.  By the way, “beat”  has a couple of different meanings in English, so definitely take a look at our Lea rning Guide for some more explanations.  “To be blown away” means to have a very favorable impression of something, to like something very much, much m ore than you expected it.  “I went to see the movie Slumdog Milliona ire and I was blown away by it,” I thought was very good, much better than I expe cted. 

Well, J.D. is not blown away by J.McQ’s first song; he says,  “It’s also a really bad mix.”  A “mix” is the combination of voices, instruments , music, as well as other sounds in a recorded song.  So, it’s the mixture of these different elements in the song.  J.D. says, “The bass is up too high, and I can hardly hear the treble.”  The “bass,” in music, are the low-pitched sounds – low, like th is.  That’s bass.  You can also use the word to describe a bass guitar, which is a guitar that plays these very low notes.  The opposite of “bass” is “treble.”  “Tr eble” refers to the high notes, like you might hear in a woman’s voice.   

J.D. asks, “Is the whole album like that?” meaning are al l of the songs that way. Victoria says, “Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t notice.  Maybe  the volume wasn’t up high enough.”  The “volume” refers to the loudness of m usic or sound.  She’s saying that she didn’t notice these problems because perha ps the volume wasn’t up high enough.  We talk about the volume being “high ” when it’s loud, and “low” when it’s soft.   

J.D. says, “No, it was up high enough.  Maybe he’s not tha t good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mi xing.”  A “vocalist” is someone who sings; it’s a singer.  The “sound engineers” a re the people who try to improve the recorded music before it is sold.  So the y record a singer, and then they do things to the recording to try to make it so und better.  Sometimes they do things that make the voice sound a lot better th an the person can actually sing, that way they cover up the problems.  “To cover (somet hing) up” is a  

 phrasal verb meaning to do something so that no one else  can see it or hear it. So they cover up the bad singing by doing these other thi ngs. 

Victoria is somewhat angry at J.D., she says, “Are you kiddin g (are you joking)? J.McQ is an amazing singer (a great singer).  Come on, li sten to another track. I’m sure you’ll change your mind,” you’ll have a differen t opinion of J.McQ.  J.D. says, “No, thanks.  I’d rather listen to a bunch of fighti ng cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!”  Of course, fighting cats don’t sound very nice.  But I’m guessing here that J.D. is a musician and he is a little j ealous of J.McQ, because Victoria likes J.McQ’s music and J.D. is jealous; he wants to h ave all of the attention for himself.  I’m pretty sure that’s what’s h appening in this dialogue! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
