[start of dialogue]

Security Chief: Okay, people. We’ve just had a repo rt of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this building. Look in every nook and cranny.

Ramona: Excuse me, may I ask a question?

Security Chief: You can when I’m done. Now you two,  I want you to look all over the grounds. Make sure you check in the undergrowth  and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.

Ramona: Do you mind if I ask . . .?

Security Chief: I’ll stay here to coordinate the se arch. Report in if you see anything that could point us in the right direction .

Ramona: I really think I should tell you . . .

Security Chief: Don’t interrupt, please. The rest of you: Spread out and look in the parking lot and behind the buildings. Look high  and low. We’ll search this place from top to bottom and leave no stone unturne d. Now, are there any questions?

Ramona: Yes, is the little boy about five years old  with brown hair and glasses?

Security Chief: Yes, that’s right. How did you know ?

Ramona: Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk  off with your Taser!

Our dialogue begins with the head of security (the security chief, the person in charge of “security” – keeping people safe) saying to Ramona, “Okay, people. We’ve just had a report of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this b uilding. Look in every nook and cranny.” The security chief is talking to the peopl e who work for him, we’re guessing.

He’s talking about a missing child. A “missing chil d” would be a child who is not where he should be. Anything that is missing is not  where it should be – not in the location where we expect it to be. If it’s miss ing, we can’t find it. In this case, they can’t find this child. The security chief tell s the people there to “search,” or look in, “every room in this building.”

“Look in every nook and cranny,” he says. “Every no ok (nook) and cranny (cranny)” is an old expression that means look in e very little place, even though you may think it’s too small or not important. To l ook in every nook and cranny is to be very thorough – to look in every possible pla ce. Ramona says, “Excuse me, may I ask a question?” The security chief says, “Yo u can when I’m done,” meaning when I finish talking, then you can ask you r question.

The security chief goes on and says, “Now you two, I want you to look all over the grounds.” The word “grounds” (grounds) refers to the land that a group of buildings is on. It’s used to refer to the property  of some, usually, organization or company. It’s often used to describe a larger piece  of property. You wouldn’t usually talk about the land around your small house , for example, as the grounds of your property. It’s normally used to describe a larger piece of property on which there are several different buildings.

The security chief says, “Make sure you check in the undergrowth and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.” The “undergro wth” is the group of small plants that often grow close to the ground, usually  underneath much taller trees. The security chief is telling them to look or to ch eck in the undergrowth because this perhaps is a small child who might be hiding there. He tells them to “cover the entire terrain.” “To cover” the terrain means to go and walk or look in the

entire terrain. “Terrain” (terrain) refers to the l and. It’s similar to the word “grounds” in this instance.

Ramona says, “Do you mind if I ask . . .?” She want s to ask a question, but again the security chief doesn’t let her. He says, “I’ll stay here to coordinate the search.” “To coordinate” (coordinate) means to orga nize and plan something, usually something involving the work of a group of people.

The security chief says, “Report in if you see anyt hing that could point us in the right direction.” “To report in” is a phrasal verb meaning to give someone an update on where you are or what you’re doing. A pol ice officer who is out looking for someone might report in every hour and tell his  boss what he has found or where he is.

“To point someone in the right direction” is to giv e someone an idea of where to go or how to do something – to give someone advice or guidance, we might say, about how either to arrive at a certain place or ho w to do something. It can be used to refer to actually giving someone a directio n in the physical sense – you’re telling the person where to go in order to arrive a t a certain place. More generally, though, it’s used to talk about giving s ome information to someone that will help them accomplish some task, to do somethin g. In this case, it would be to help them find the child.

Ramona says, “I really think I should tell you . . .,” but the security chief again doesn’t let poor Ramona talk. He says, in fact, “Do n’t interrupt.” “Don’t interrupt” means don’t stop me from talking while I am still t alking. This chief says, “The rest of you spread out and look in the parking lot and behind the buildings.” The phrasal verb “to spread (spread) out” means for a g roup of people to go in different directions so that together they can cove r or search a larger area.

If there are five people who are trying to find the  child, it doesn’t make any sense for all five people to stay together. Instead, they  should spread out. They should separate so that they can look over a larger area m ore quickly. The security chief tells them to “look high and low.” This is a phrase  we use when giving instructions to indicate that someone should look e verywhere. It’s similar to the previous expression, “to look in every nook and cra nny.” “To look high and low” means to look everywhere.

The security chief says, “We’ll search this place f rom top to bottom and leave no stone unturned. Now, are there any questions?” The expressions “from top to bottom” and “to leave no stone (stone) unturned” are quite similar to looking “high

and low” or looking in “every nook and cranny.” It means to look everywhere. From “top” – from the very highest point – to “bott om,” the very lowest point.

If you’re leaving “no stone unturned,” you are look ing perhaps literally under every rock. The word “stone” here means rock. “To l eave no stone unturned” means that you are leaving no stone that hasn’t bee n looked under, that you haven’t turned over in order to look underneath. Al l these expressions mean to look very thoroughly, to look everywhere possible. Ramona finally gets a chance to ask her question. She says, “Yes, is the little boy about five years old with brown hair and glasses?” She’s asking about the des cription of the boy, what he looks like.

The security chief says, “Yes, that’s right. How di d you know?” Ramona then says, “Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk off with your Taser.” The expression “Don’t look now” is used to mean the sam e as “Surprise,” or “Guess what just happened.” It’s used to tell someone that  you are about to give them some unexpected information, some information that the other person – if he had been more observant, if he had been paying attentio n – should have seen for himself. It can also be used, however, just to refe r to surprising or startling information that you are about to tell someone.

Ramona says, “Don’t look now, but” this little boy “is just about to walk off with” – meaning to take and to leave with – “your Taser.” A  “Taser” (Taser) is a weapon sometimes used by police that produces an electric shock that causes pain and prevents the person temporarily from moving. So, wh at happens here is that the security chief is so busy organizing the search for  the little boy, that he doesn’t realize the little boy is right there and is about to walk off with one of the weapons of the security chief – which, of course, would be rather dangerous.

This script reminds me of a story I read not too lo ng ago about a woman who was part of some tour group. When the tour group wa s about to leave, the leader of the tour group didn’t see the woman, and so they  started to search for the woman. Now, the woman herself didn’t realize who th ey were searching for, and so she started basically searching for herself. It was only after several hours did she realize that the group was searching for her. S he apparently had changed her clothing or something. I don’t know.

Anyway, I don’t know if that story is true or not –  that’s what I read in the newspaper, but don’t believe everything you read in  the newspaper.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Security Chief: Okay, people. We’ve just had a repo rt of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this building. Look in every nook and cranny.

Ramona: Excuse me, may I ask a question?

Ramona: Yes, is the little boy about five years old  with brown hair and glasses?

Security Chief: Yes, that’s right. How did you know ?

Ramona: Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk  off with your Taser!
