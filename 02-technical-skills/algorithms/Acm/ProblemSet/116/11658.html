Envy Inc. is a joint stock company, that is, a company in which 
every stockholder legally owns shares of stock that account
for some percentage of the total shares of stock of the company.
Due to the global economic crisis, 
the management rules of Envy Inc. define a particular way for 
distributing last year's profit: if a stockholder owns more 
than half of the shares of stock, he/she wins the total profit.
Nothing fancy so far in this wild world!

<P>
Nevertheless, there are situations in which no stockholder
owns more than 50% of the shares of stock of the company.
So, in order to gain some profit, stockholders are allowed to form
<EM>coalitions</EM>, i.e., groups of stockholders. The participation 
of the coalition, share-wise, is equivalent to the sum of its 
stockholders' percentile participation. Hence, if a coalition
has more than half of the shares of stock, its members win the
totality of last years profit. Then, the members of the coalition
receive a part of the profit proportional to their individual
participation in the coalition.

<P>
For instance, let us assume there are 5 stockholders: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN>, owning <SPAN CLASS="MATH">20%</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">12%</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">14%</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">29%</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">25%</SPAN>
of the stock of the company, respectively. The stockholder <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> could
form several winning coalitions. For example, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> were to form a coalition
with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>, he/she would get <SPAN CLASS="MATH">43.86%</SPAN> of last year's profit.
If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> were to form a coalition with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> instead, he/she
would get <SPAN CLASS="MATH">49.02%</SPAN> of last year's profit. On the other hand,
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>E</I></SPAN> could not form a winning coalition with only <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>.

<P>
Your problem is, given a distribution of shares of stock of Envy Inc., and a stockholder, to
determine the maximum percentage of the last year's profit that the given stockholder may win.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input consists of several test cases, each one defining a
percentile distribution of shares of stock, and the index of a stockholder
to determine his/her optimal participation. More precisely, each test
case is defined by several input lines:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the first line contains two integer values <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq n \leq 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>n</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> 100</SPAN>)
  and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq x \leq n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>x</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>n</I></SPAN>), separated by a blank, representing the
  number of stockholders in Envy Inc. and the index of a stockholder to
  determine his/her optimal participation, respectively;
</LI>
<LI>each one of the following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines has a single floating point
  value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, rounded to 2 decimal places, which represents the percentage
  of stock ownership of stockholder <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq i \leq n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>i</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11658img1.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>n</I></SPAN>). The floating
  point delimiter is `<TT>.</TT>' (i.e. the dot). You can assume
  that <!-- MATH
 $p_1 + \ldots + p_n = 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> +...+ <I>p</I><SUB>n</SUB> = 100</SPAN>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The end of the input is indicated by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = <I>x</I> = 0</SPAN>, an artificial case that must be ignored.

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each given case, output a single line with the corresponding answer.
The answer should be formatted and approximated to two decimal places. The
floating point delimiter must be `<TT>.</TT>' (i.e. the dot). The rounding applies
towards the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">nearest neighbor</SPAN> unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case
the result is rounded up (e.g. <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.312</SPAN> is rounded to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.31</SPAN>; <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.566</SPAN> is rounded
to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.57</SPAN>; <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.345</SPAN> is rounded to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">78.35</SPAN>, etc.).
