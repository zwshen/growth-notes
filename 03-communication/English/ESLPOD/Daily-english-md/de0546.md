This episode is called “Having an Open House.”  It’s a di alogue between Kyoko and Ernie; they’re going to be using some vocabulary th at is common when we talk about open houses, when you sell your house.  We’ll find out more about that in a minute.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kyoko:  We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we shoul d leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without us looking over  her shoulder.

Ernie:  We’re not looking over her shoulder.  I just wa nt to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.

Kyoko:  You know, there’ll be a lot of lookie-loos.  And  plus, there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we’ll be able to see afterwards how many peopl e stopped in.

Ernie:  Hey, someone’s coming in now.

Kyoko:  That’s the stager.  She’s making some last-minute changes.

Ernie:  She really doesn’t need to do anything else.  W e did everything our agent told us to do.  We made cosmetic repairs, painted, and de-cluttered.  What more could they ask for?

 Kyoko:  She’s just doing some minor landscaping, putting so me plants along the front path and around the front door.  Let’s get out  of here before people start showing up.  I don’t want to seem like I’m spying on my o wn house.

Ernie:  What does it matter?  Hand me the fact sheet for our house.  I want to read it through again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything.  Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct, s he noted that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades – good.  Where are you going?

Kyoko:  I’m not going to sit in this car for the next fou r hours.  Let’s go to visit our neighbors’ open houses.

Ernie:  Good idea.  We’ll see what our competition is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!

[end of dialogue]

Kyoko begins this dialogue by saying to Ernie, “We’re not supposed to be here.” What she’s saying is that this is a place where they are not  permitted or that they should not be in.  “We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we should leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without  us looking over her shoulder.”  A “real estate agent” refers to a person, t he agent, who sells houses and buildings – real estate.  So a real estate agent i s someone who sells and buys homes, buildings, and sometimes just the land.

An “open house” is an event where people can come into a  home that is for sale, walk through it, look at it, learn about it, ask questio ns of the real estate agent, the person who’s selling the home for the owners; in t he United States this is a very common custom.  To sell your house you have, usually on a  Sunday afternoon from one in the afternoon to perhaps four or two to five, you have people come to your house, you advertise your house for sale , people come and walk around it and look at it and can ask the agent ques tions.  Typically, however, the owners of the house are not at the open house.  The real estate agent is responsible for showing the house.  Some people  like to have open houses because it gets more people interested in their ho use, and perhaps someone will buy it from looking at it.  Some people d on’t like open houses because many times the people who go and look at the ho use are not really interested in buying it; they just want to see what the  house looks like.  So if you come to the United States in you’re in a large city, you can buy the Sunday newspaper, take a look at the open house listings, and sim ply go and take a look at some houses, pretending perhaps that you’re intereste d.  Many people go and look at other people’s houses if they’re going to be sel ling theirs to see how good

 the house is for the price.  It sometimes helps you figu re out what price you want to put on your house.  Most real estate agents know that  many of the people who come to the house are not really that interested in bu ying it; they just want to see. Sometimes even the neighbors come and look at a house th at is being sold in their neighborhood.

Kyoko says that she thinks that she and Ernie should leave.  S he says that they should let their real estate agent hold the open house  – “to hold an open house” means to have an open house – “without us looking over he r shoulder.”  “To look over (someone’s) shoulder” is an expression that means to wa tch another person’s work very closely, to pay careful attention to what  another person is doing, especially when that person doesn’t want you watchi ng them.  So you’re doing something at your desk in your office and your boss co mes over and looks at what you are doing and watches you work, you might s ay to him, “Why are you looking over my shoulder?”  He may, or she, may not actual ly be looking over your shoulder, that is looking down at your desk with thei r head above your shoulder.  It’s the expression that we use to mean to wat ch someone else working when they don’t really want you watching them w orking.

Ernie says, “We’re not looking over her shoulder.  I just want to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.”  So they’re not i n the house; they’re sitting in their car outside of the house.  Kyoko says, “You know, t here’ll be a lot of lookie-loos.”  A “lookie-loo” is an informal expression for someone who likes to see what is happening, especially someone who doesn’t real ly need to see it.  So in this case, lookie-loos would be people, as I mentioned  earlier, who go to the open house and don’t want to buy the house, they just w ant to see the house. Kyoko says, “And plus (meaning in addition), there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we will be able to see afterwards how many people stopped in.”  A “sign-in sheet” is a piece of paper where everyone who is participating or  attending a certain event puts his or her name, sometimes the address and the phon e number.  In open houses, real estate agents asks everyone who comes into the ho use to sign the sign-in sheet, mainly to get their name and telephone number and call them later to see if they’re interested in selling their house or interested in buying the house. It is also proof to the owners of the house that people  came and looked at the house.  The term “sign-in sheet” can be used for any eve nt, anything that you want people, when they first come to, to put down the ir name, sometimes their signature.  So Kyoko is telling Ernie that they don’t ne ed to sit there and watch everyone going into the house, they can just look at the si gn-in sheet later.

Ernie says, “Hey, someone’s coming in now.”  Someone is go ing into their house. Kyoko says, “That’s the stager.  She’s making some last-minut e changes.”  A “stager” (stager) is a person whose job it is to make the home look nice.

 Sometimes when people move and they haven’t sold their h ouse, the house will be empty when people come to look at it.  Real estate a gents have found that people are more likely to buy a house if they can imagin e themselves in the house, and that means putting things in the house – the  empty house – that will help you imagine what the house will look like.  So you put a bed in, you put a television in, you put pictures on the wall.  None of th ese belong to the owner; they’re just there to help the people looking at the h ouse to get a better picture, if you will, of what the house looks like when there is fur niture inside.  “To make last-minute changes” means to change something right befo re the event starts, in the last hour or maybe last day.

Ernie says, “She really doesn’t need to do anything else (that is, the stager).  We did everything our agent told us to do.  We made cosmeti c repairs, painted, and de-cluttered.”  “To repair (something)” is to fix it.  A “cosmetic repair” improves the appearance of something, in this case the appearan ce of the house.  You don’t actually make it a better house, or a stronger or  a safer house; you may paint the walls, for example.  That’s a cosmetic change.  You may fix something that is broken so that it looks better; that would be a cosmetic repair.  “To clutter” (clutter) means to put too many things in a space, on you r desk or in a room, so that it looks crowded.  “To de-clutter,” then, means to  take away things so that the space is more open, that you can see the desk, you can see  the room better.

Kyoko says the stager is doing some minor landscaping.  “Land scaping” is when you do something with the plants, the trees, the grass ou tside of a home to make it more beautiful.  She says that the stager is putting  some plants along the front path, where people walk into the house.  “Let’s get ou t of here before people start showing up,” she says.  “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to arrive, to appear, to come to a particular event or pla ce: “What time did your brother show up last night?”  You were waiting for hi m, he was late, he didn’t show up until 8:00.  Kyoko says, “I don’t want to seem li ke I’m spying on my own house.”  “To spy on (something)” means to look at it in se cret, to get information.

Ernie says, “What does it matter (what difference does it  make)?  Hand me the fact sheet for our house.”  “Hand me” means give me – pu t in my hand – the fact sheet.  A “fact sheet” is a piece of paper with detail ed information about something; it could be about anything.  For a house, the fact sheet would have the price, how big the house is, and so forth.  Ernie says, “I want to read it through (meaning I want to read it completely) again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything.  Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct.”  The “square footage” is the number of square feet in a particular area; it’s a way of measuring the size of a house.  The “lot” ( lot) is the land that the

 house sits on, or the building sits on.  “Lot” has a coupl e of other meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional defi nitions.

Then Ernie says that the real estate agent noted, or pu t on the paper, that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades.   An “addition” to a house is a new part of the house that was built after the original house.  The word “addition” has some additional definitions; once again , the Learning Guide will help you.  When we say that a part of the house or a bu ilding is “permitted,” we mean that it has all the necessary permissions and governme nt documents.  If you decide you want to add a new room to your house, you need to get permission from the city, and the city comes and looks at it  to make sure that what you built is safe.  This is part of getting someth ing permitted.  Many people, at least here in Los Angeles, because it’s so expensive to g et a government permit – a government approval – will add things to th eir house without getting approval from the government.  Of course, if the gover nment finds out, they’ll have to pay for the permit; but usually the government  is too busy trying to do other things, like spend our money!  Ernie said that the real estate agent mentioned the upgrades.  An “upgrade” is an improvemen t to something.  For a home, usually it’s making the home better, perhaps by pu tting in a nicer kitchen, putting in a nicer refrigerator.  These would be upgr ades.  Changing the carpet, that would be also a minor upgrade; more cosmetic tha n anything else, but still, it makes the house nicer.

Well, Kyoko says that she doesn’t want to sit in the car for  the next four hours during the open house.  She says, “Let’s go to visit our n eighbors’ open houses.” Ernie says, “Good idea.  We’ll see what our competition  is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!”  So, Ernie and K yoko are going to look at other open houses, just like I mentioned earlier people  often do, to see if they can get some ideas about selling their house.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Kyoko:  We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we shoul d leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without us looking over  her shoulder.
