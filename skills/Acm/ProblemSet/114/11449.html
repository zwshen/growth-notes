<h2><font color="#0070E8">Context</font></h2>

<p>Deciding the optimum number of pit stops in a Formula One race is not a trivial matter.
The problem is greatly influenced by many factors: the length of the circuit and the total
number of laps, the time lost in each pit stop, the maximum tank capacity of the car, the
fuel consumption per kilometer, the relationship between speed and current weight of the
fuel, etc.</p>

<p>You have been hired by the prestigious F1 team SlowCheapCars in order to decide their
optimum pit stops strategy. Help them to win the race.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Problem</font></h2>

<p>Each time we do a pit stop, some precious seconds are lost. In particular, there are
two components:

<ul>
  <li>A constant time, <strong>G</strong>, due to slowing down, stopping, and accelerating
    back up to normal speed; and</li>
  <li>A variable quantity, <strong>x*H</strong>, depending on the number of litres added to
    the tank (<strong>x</strong>) and the speed of the highly pressurized refueling system (<strong>H</strong>,
    in seconds/litre).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides, the average speed of the car per lap is not constant; on the contrary, it
depends on the fuel load at a given moment. When the tank is full, the car is normally
slower because of its total weight. But when it is almost empty, the car is able to go
faster. This variation is given by the number of seconds gained per lap when the fuel load
is reduced 10 litres, <strong>F</strong> (in seconds per 10 litres). For example, let <strong>E</strong>
be the time to complete a lap starting with the full tank, and let <strong>D</strong> be
this maximum capacity of the tank; if the current fuel load is <strong>D</strong>-20
litres, the lap time will be: <strong>E</strong>-2<strong>F</strong>.</p>

<p>The initial fuel load of the car is given by <strong>C</strong> (in litres). However,
according to a recent regulation by the F.R.I.A., we have the possibility to start the
race from the pit line; in that case, we are free to decide the initial fuel load, at the
expense of losing <strong>I</strong> seconds in the first lap.</p>

<p>Some other parameters of the problem are the total number of laps of the race, <strong>A</strong>,
the length of the circuit, <strong>B</strong> (in kilometers), the fuel consumption per
lap, <strong>J</strong>, and the name of the circuit, <strong>N</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>pit stop strategy</strong> is given by the number of stops and the decision
whether to start or not from the pit
line. We want to obtain the optimum strategy of pit stops in a given circuit, that is, the
one that produces the minimum total time to complete the <strong>A</strong> laps.
Obviously, the fuel load of the car can never be below 0.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Input</font></h2>

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <em>M</em>, indicating the number of
test cases.</p>

<p>For each test case, there are the following lines (the text in <strong>bold</strong>
appears literally):</p>

<pre><strong>Circuit</strong> N
A B
<strong>Fuel</strong>
C D
<strong>Speed</strong>
E F
<strong>Pit stop</strong>
G H I
<strong>Consumption</strong>
J</pre>

<p>Where:

<ul>
  <p><strong>A</strong>: number of laps of the race (from 1 to 100). Integer.<br>
  <strong>B</strong>: length of the circuit, i.e., kilometers per lap. Real with 2 decimal
  digits.<br>
  <strong>C</strong>: initial fuel in the tank of the car, in litres (from 1 to 200).
  Integer.<br>
  <strong>D</strong>: maximum capacity of the tank of the car, in litres (from 1 to 200, and
  0&lt;=<strong>C</strong>&lt;=<strong>D</strong>). Integer.<br>
  <strong>E</strong>: number of seconds per lap starting the lap with the full tank. Real
  with 2 decimal digits.<br>
  <strong>F</strong>: number of seconds per lap gained for each reduction of 10 litres in
  fuel load. Real with 1 decimal digit. It could be negative.<br>
  <strong>G</strong>: constant time lost in each pit stop, in seconds. Real with 2 decimal
  digits.<br>
  <strong>H</strong>: seconds per litre lost in the pit stop to refuel the car. Real with 2
  decimal digits.<br>
  <strong>I</strong>: seconds lost in the first lap if we decide to start from the pit line.
  Real with 2 decimal digits.<br>
  <strong>J</strong>: litres of fuel consumed per lap (it is supposed to be independent of
  the speed, and <strong>J</strong>&lt;=<strong>D</strong>). Integer.<br>
  <strong>N</strong>: the name of the circuit. String.<br>
  </p>
</ul>

<p>Observe that fuel is always considered to be an integer value, while time is given in
seconds with 2 decimal digits (rounding is not required in this problem).</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Output</font></h2>

<p>For each test case, the output should contain the following lines (the text in <strong>bold</strong>
must appear literally):</p>

<pre><strong>Circuit</strong> N
<strong>Estimated time</strong>
T
<strong>Initial fuel</strong>
K
<strong>Pit stops</strong>
S
</pre>

<p>Where:

<ul>
  <p><strong>T</strong>: estimated time (in seconds) to complete the <strong>A</strong> laps
  of the race using the optimum strategy. Real with 2 decimal digits.<br>
  <strong>K</strong>: initial fuel load; if <strong>K</strong> is not equal to <strong>C</strong>,
  it means that we start the race from the pit line. Integer.<br>
  <strong>S</strong>: optimum number of pits stops. Integer.<br>
  </p>
</ul>

<p>You can suppose that the solution always exists and is unique.</p>
