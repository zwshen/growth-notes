This episode is about ordering coffee and tea.  I t hink I’ve had a little too much coffee this morning, but we’ll go ahead and start t he dialogue now.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  I’d like a decaf drip, to go.

Drew:  Would you like our light or dark roast?

Jermaine:  I’ll just have whatever’s freshly brewed .

Drew:  Are you sure you don’t want to try an espres so, an Americano, or a latte?

Jermaine:  No, just a decaf coffee.

Drew:  Sure, no problem.  Would you like it hot or cold?

Jermaine:  Hot, please.

Drew:  Would you like any room for cream?

Jermaine:  No, thanks.

Drew:  Would you like some sweetener?  A couple of pumps of syrup maybe?

Jermaine:  No, I’ll add a couple of packets of suga r myself.

 Drew:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I added some foam from anoth er drink to your coffee by accident.  I’ll have to start over.  Did you say yo u wanted the light or dark roast?

Jermaine:  Forget it.  Let’s keep it simple.  Give me a cup of tea.

Drew:  Would you like that hot or cold, sweetened o r unsweetened, loose leaf or in a tea bag?

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is about two of my favorite topics: c offee and tea.  I’m not sure if I mentioned, but recently I started drinking coffee a gain.  Now, those of you who’ve listened to many of our podcasts know that I ’m usually – or have been, I should say, a tea drinker.  I particularly like the  Starbucks tea, the Vente Earl Grey Latte at seven pumps of vanilla, nonfat, no fo am.  However, more recently I’ve gone back to drinking coffee again.  It used t o bother my stomach, but for some reason, maybe I’m getting older and my stomach  doesn’t care anymore, but I’ve been able to drink coffee a lot more.  So,  I’m very excited about this episode, talking about coffee and tea.

Jermaine begins by saying, “I’ll have a decaf drip,  to go.”  Now Jermaine is at a café or a coffee shop or a coffee house, a place wh ere you would buy coffee and tea, so he’s ordering a cup of coffee.  He says he wants a decaf drip, to go. “Decaf” is short for “decaffeinated,” that’s when y ou drink coffee that doesn’t have the caffeine that gets you awake or, for some people, overly excited.  I don’t drink decaf coffee, unless it’s late at night and I  know I need to go to sleep soon. “Coffee,” of course, is a drink made from putting h ot water through grounded coffee beans.  When we say something is “to go” we mean we are going to take it with us, we’re not going to drink it there at the café.  In the United States, it’s very popular to get coffee to go; in other countrie s, it’s not as popular.  But in the U.S., many, many people, maybe most people who go t o a café or to a place like Starbucks get their drink to go, meaning they have a plastic or a paper cup and they’re able to take the drink with them in their c ar or wherever they’re going. “Drip” (drip) refers to coffee that is made usually  in someone’s home, but in a Starbucks or in a café a drip coffee is the coffee that they’ve already made.  It’s usually coffee that has been made in the last 30 to  60 minutes; it’s not coffee that they have to make specially for you.  It usually ch anges; the kind of coffee changes every day depending on the café you go to.  But a “drip coffee” is just the regular coffee, whatever it is that they’re ser ving today; you’re not asking for anything special.

So Jermaine asks for a decaf drip, to go.  Drew say s, “Would you like our light or dark roast?”  The “roast” (roast) is how long the c offee beans have been cooked over a hot fire, and usually when you roast the cof fee beans for a long time the beans get dark and it gives the coffee a different taste – a different flavor.  You can have a dark roasted coffee, a medium roasted co ffee, and a light roasted coffee, and the light roast doesn’t have as strong of a taste as the darker roast.

Jermaine says, “I’ll have whatever’s freshly brewed .”  “To brew (brew) coffee” means to mix the coffee with hot water.  We might a lso talk about brewing beer, but that’s when you have a different process of boi ling some liquid in the process of making beer.  But when we’re brewing coffee, it just means adding the hot water to the coffee or pouring the hot water throug h the coffee, which is the way it’s usually done.  Jermaine says he wants whatever ’s “freshly” brewed – recently brewed.

Drew says, “Are you sure you don’t want to try an e spresso, an Americano, or a latte?”  These three words: “espresso” (which many Americans pronounce “expresso ” as though there were an “x” in there but there is n’t), “Americano,” and “latte” are Italian words, because the Italians, ma ny people believe, have some of the best coffee or prepare some of the best coffee in the world.  An “espresso” is a very dark, strong coffee that is made by pushing hot water through the coffee very quickly in a special machine called an “espres so machine.”  Nowadays, many people have espresso machines in their houses.   I have one, but I don’t usually drink espresso.  An “Americano” is a drink made by taking the espresso and adding some additional hot water so that it isn ’t quite as strong.  In many countries, in Italy for example, when you order a c offee you’ll get an espresso. So if you want something more like an American coff ee you have to ask for an Americano.  A “latte” is coffee with milk; “latte” is the Italian word for milk.  In this case it’s hot milk – steamed milk, and usually you add what are called “shots” of espresso.  A “shot” is just a small amount of liqui d.

But Jermaine doesn’t want any of that.  He says, “N o, just a decaf coffee.”  “Drew says, “Sure, no problem.  Would you like it hot or cold?”  Some people like cold coffee.  Jermaine says, “Hot, please.”  Drew then s ays, “Would you like any room for cream?”  “Cream” (cream) is something that come s from a cow; it has a lot of fat in it.  It is the part of the milk that rises t o the top of a milk container from cow’s milk, so it’s sort of a very fatty kind of mi lk.  It’s a liquid that people often put in coffee; sometimes they just put in milk – re gular milk.  “Room” means space.  In this case, when someone says “I want roo m for cream,” they mean they want the person working at the café, sometimes  called a “barista,” to pour the coffee in a cup but leave room in the cup for s ome cream, and then the customer, the person buying the coffee, can add the  amount of cream or milk

that they want.  In many cafés you can just say, “I ’d like a coffee with room,” and you don’t even have to say “room for cream,” they u nderstand what you mean. So if you really want to sound like a native speake r, you go into a café and you say, “Yeah, I’d like a large drip coffee with room,  please,” and they’ll know that you want room for cream so they will leave some ext ra room in the cup.

Jermaine says, “No, thanks.”  He doesn’t want room for cream.  Drew says, “Would you like some sweetener?”  “Sweetener” is so mething that, of course, makes the drink sweeter; sugar is the most obvious kind of way of sweetening a drink.  But nowadays we have artificial sweeteners,  things that kind of taste like sugar; they don’t really, but they make something s weeter.  You can also make something sweeter by putting “syrup” in it, which i s basically a liquid kind of sugar.  Syrup (syrup) comes in many different flavo rs; you could have vanilla syrup, for example, in your coffee.  I don’t like t hat, but some people do.  Drew actually asks Jermaine if he wants a few pumps of s yrup.  A “pump” (pump) is just a small amount of syrup.  It’s the way that th ey measure the amount of syrup in a café, because it comes from a bottle and the b ottle on the top of it has a device called a “pump,” which is what you use to re move liquid from something by drawing it upwards.

Well, Jermaine doesn’t want any syrup.  He says, “I ’ll add a couple of packets of sugar myself.”  A “packet” is a small container of something.  Usually when you go to a café or some restaurants, you will get suga r or sweetener in a “packet,” a little container made out of paper.  Drew says, “Oh , I’m sorry.  I’ve added some foam from another drink to your coffee by accident. ”  “Foam” is when you have a lot of very small “bubbles,” little bits of air in the liquid, and this might happen if you are, for example, steaming the milk.  You are h eating the milk up very quickly by using hot air, and that air produces small bubbl es of air that can cause foam on the top of the milk that you are steaming.  Some  people, when they have a latte drink or a drink with milk in it, don’t want the foam.  But Drew has accidentally added foam to Jermaine’s drink.  She t ells Jermaine that she’ll start over, she’ll make his drink again.  She says, “Did you say you wanted the light or dark roast?”

Jermaine says, “Forget it.  Let’s keep it simple.  Give me a cup of tea.”  Drew says, “Would you like that hot or cold, sweetened o r unsweetened, loose leaf or in a tea bag?”  There are different ways of prepari ng tea, just as there are different ways of preparing coffee: hot and cold, s weetened or unsweetened – with sugar or without sugar.  Also, the tea can be put into the hot water directly, or it can be put into a tea bag.  When you use a te a bag, when you’re done making tea, when the tea has been in the hot water long enough you can then pull the tea out easily by just removing the bag.  When you put tea in loose leaf,

that means the tea goes right into the water; there ’s no bag that you can use to take it out when you don’t want it there anymore.  But people who drink their tea with loose leaf tea don’t really care, usually they  just leave it in there until they’re done drinking and then they clean it out later.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

 You don’t need to add sweetener to our dialogues; t hey’re already sweet.  That’s because they’re made by the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
