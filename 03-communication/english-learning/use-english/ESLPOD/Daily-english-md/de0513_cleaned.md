This episode is called “Snooping and Eavesdropping.”  The se are different ways of gathering or collecting information secretly, sometim es illegally.  We’ll listen to a conversation Enrique and Stella, who are trying to g et information about Stella’s boyfriend.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Enrique:  I don’t know how you talked me into coming wi th you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers.  This snooping i s stupid!  If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him. 

Stella:  Confront him without any evidence?  That woul d be the height of stupidity.   

Enrique:  Instead, we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves.  I thought you said he wouldn’t be home until 6:00.   

Stella:  That’s what I thought.  Just sit tight.  I thi nk he just came home to pick something up.  He’ll be gone in a minute. 

Enrique:  I don’t like confined spaces.  If we don’t make  a break for it soon, I’m going to suffocate. 

Stella:  Stop your kvetching.  Now that we’re here, ma ybe we can do better than looking through his papers.  We can eavesdrop on his conver sations. 

Enrique:  Have you lost your mind?  Do you know what he  would do to us if he found us here?  

 Stella:  No guts, no glory!

Enrique and Stella are inside of Dan’s apartment.  In  fact, they’re inside one of the closets of Dan’s apartment, the small space you use usu ally to put clothing or other things.  Dan has come home unexpectedly while Enri que and Stella were there trying to find information about him.   

Enrique says, “I don’t know how you talked me into coming  with you to Dan’s apartment.”  “To talk (someone) into (something)” is t o get another person to agree to do something that they don’t really want to d o, and usually we use this expression when you discover later that it was a mistake, th at you should have said no.  “I don’t know how you talked me into buying t his car, it’s too expensive” – I should not have listened to you.  The verb “to talk”  has several different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for this ep isode for some more explanations. 

Enrique says that he doesn’t know how Stella talked him i nto coming with her to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers.  “To rifl e through (something)” means to look through something quickly, usually to steal it, usually for reasons that are not good.  Someone who’s looking for something who wan ts to steal something may rifle through your desk – the papers on your desk in o rder to find that something.  Enrique says, “This snooping is stupid!”  “To snoop” (snoop) means to spy, to look at things that you shouldn’t be looking a t or that don’t belong to you, usually things that contain some sort of secret infor mation.  Enrique says, “If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.”  A “suspi cion” is a thought or a feeling that something is wrong.  You don’t have any pr oof, you don’t have any evidence, but you have a suspicion – you think that somethin g might be wrong. 

Stella says, “Confront him without any evidence?”  “To con front (someone)” means to talk to someone or deal with something that is difficult or unpleasant, usually to talk to another person about a very difficult t opic.  Stella says, asking Enrique, “Confront him without any evidence?  That wou ld be the height of stupidity.”  “Stupidity” is a noun for things that are st upid or foolish.  The expression “the height of stupidity” means this would be  extremely stupid, very stupid.  We use this expression sometimes, “the height of”  followed by some noun, usually when we’re expressing something negative tha t has happened, something very bad.  For example: “That is the height o f arrogance to tell the President of the United States that he should cut his ha ir.”  It’s the height of  

 arrogance – it’s the very extreme example, the highest ex ample of that particular quality. 

Enrique says, “Instead (instead of confronting Dan direct ly), we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves.”  “To be holed up (somewhere)” m eans to be trapped in a small space and you can’t get out.  You’re stuck; you can’t leave.  If you go skiing and suddenly there’s a lot of snow and you can’t leave you r hotel, you could be holed up in your hotel.  Sometimes we use this expression  when someone voluntarily goes somewhere that they don’t want to leave,  to be separated from other people.  But here, Enrique is using it to mean that they are in a small space, a closet, and they can’t leave.  They can’t leave bec ause they’re in Dan’s apartment, and Dan doesn’t know that they are there. 

Stella tells Enrique to sit tight.  “To sit tight” mea ns to be patient and don’t move, don’t go anywhere else.  “I think Dan just came home to pick up something up (or to pick something up – it means the same).  He’ll be gon e (he’ll leave) in a minute.”  Enrique says, “I don’t like confined spaces.”  “Confined” means you don’t have a lot of room, you can’t move easily.  “Confin ed” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Lear ning Guide for some more explanations. 

Enrique says that he doesn’t like confined spaces – confine d places.  “If we don’t make a break for it soon,” he says, “I’m going to suffocate .”  “To make a break for it” means to escape, to leave a place where you are tra pped or that you’re not supposed to leave.  A prisoner may try to make a break for  it, meaning try to escape from the prison.  Enrique says if they don’t make a break for it soon (if they don’t leave – escape out of this closet), he’s going to suffocate.  “To suffocate” means to die because you can’t breathe.  Someon e may be preventing you from breathing by covering your mouth, or  maybe there just isn’t enough oxygen in the air; that could also cause you to  suffocate – to die because you can’t breathe. 

Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching.”  “To kvetch” is an informal expression meaning to complain loudly and repeatedly.  So meone who’s always complaining, “Oh, it’s so hot in here.  Oh, why can’t w e get a better air conditioner (etc., etc.),” this is someone who likes to kvetch .  The word “kvetch” is a Yiddish word, a language spoken by primarily Jewish imm igrants to the United States.  There are several Yiddish words that have become part of the general English language, at least American English. 

Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching.  Now that w e’re here, maybe we can do better than looking through his papers.  We can e avesdrop on his  

 conversations.”  “To eavesdrop” means to listen to something  that you’re not supposed to hear, to secretly listen to someone else’s conversa tion.  If someone is in a restaurant sitting next to you in the next table , and you’re not supposed be listening to their conversation but you are, that would  be to eavesdrop.  Often people eavesdrop in order to get information – to ge t secret information. 

Enrique says, “Have you lost your mind?”  “To lose your mind ” means to go crazy, to do something very strange or even illogical.  He sa ys, “Do you know what he would do to us if he found us here?”  “Do you know what he would do to us?” – do you know what sort of punishment he would give us, perhaps.  Stella, however, says, “No guts, no glory!”  “To have guts” means t o have courage; it’s an informal expression.  “No guts, no glory” means that if you don’t have courage – if you’re not willing to do something that’s difficul t, you’ll never be able to win. In order to get things that you want, things that are  difficult to obtain, you have to have guts, and if you don’t, you will never get those thi ngs.  “Glory” here refers to either being famous but more generally getting somethi ng desirable that you want. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
