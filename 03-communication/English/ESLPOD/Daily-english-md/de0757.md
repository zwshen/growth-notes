[start of dialogue]

Helen:  Okay, your schedule today is very busy.  Fi rst, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environme nt.  Then, you’re speaking to a group of factory workers.  At noon, you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.

Mikhail:  When I signed on as a candidate, I had no  idea I’d have to pander to every group out there to gain their support.

Helen:  Don’t think of it as pandering.  Think of it as rallying the troops.  People in this state need a leader and you’re their great whi te hope.

Mikhail:  I decided to run because I wanted to be a  voice of reason in the partisan bickering.  I didn’t sign on to be a poster boy for  my political party.

Helen:  You can make a difference when you get elec ted, but first things first: you need to get elected.  Ready to go?

Mikhail:  What happened to the good old days when a ll you had to do was a little gerrymandering to get elected?

Helen:  I’m glad you brought that up.  Your meeting  with the committee on redistricting is this afternoon at 2:00.

Mikhail:  I’m sorry I asked!

Helen begins by saying to Mikhail, “Okay, your sche dule today is very busy. First, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environment.”  Your “constituents” (constituents) a re people that you represent as an elected government official.  A “constituent”  is someone who votes for you and is a person you represent in, say, the Senate o r the House of Representatives or the City Council or any official  government body.  If you are a representative, then the people you represent are y our constituents.  Mikhail has a meeting with his constituents, or at least some of them, who are concerned about the environment.  Helen says, “Then, you’re s peaking to a group of factory workers,” people who work in a company – in a place  where they physically make something.  They may make tables or chairs or those little dresses that people put on their cats, anything like that.  “At noon,” Helen says, “you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.”  “ High-power” means very important, very influential, very powerful.  A “don or” (donor) is a person who gives money to an organization.  It could be to a p olitical candidate, it could be to a school, it could be to a church, a university; an y of those groups or people could have people who give them money, and those pe ople we would call “donors.”  We have donors here at ESL Podcast, peop le who give us money in order to help us continue, and we very much appreci ate it.  The verb would be, of course, “to donate” (donate).  Donors donate money,  or donations.  You could say, “Donors donate donations.”  “Donations” refers  to the money that donors donate.  Okay, this has nothing to do with doughnut s, which you can have with coffee.

Mikhail says, “When I signed on as a candidate, I h ad no idea I’d have to pander to every group out there to gain their support.”  “ To sign on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree to do something, to register or put your name down as someone who will do a certain thing.  Mikhail says when he signed on, when he agreed to be a “candidate,” a person who wants to w in an elected office – an elected position, he had no idea that he would have  to pander (pander).  Here, “to pander” means to be very nice to someone, to do  something that someone wants because you want to get their money or you wa nt to get their support. Politicians do this all the time; they pander to pe ople, they try to be nice to them so that those people will support them or will give  them money.  Interestingly enough, the verb “to pander” is also used to descri be the crime of someone who arranges for you to meet a prostitute, someone we w ould call a “pimp” or a “madam,” so there’s some connection there I think.  Mikhail says that he had no

idea that he had to pander to every group out there  in order to gain their support – to get their support and their money.

Helen says, “Don’t think of it as pandering.”  Pand ering definitely has a negative connotation to it.  “Think of it as rallying the tr oops.”  “To rally” a group of people is to get them excited about something (rally).  the “troops” normally refers to a group of soldiers, someone in the army.  But here, it just refers to the people who are your supporters, who want you to do well, who want to get you elected.  So, “to rally the troops” means to motivate, to encoura ge, to get people excited to do something.  “People in this state,” Helen says, “ne ed a leader and you’re their great white hope.”  The expression “great white hop e” means in general someone who will be a leader, who will achieve grea t things even though it’s difficult, a symbol of something or someone who wil l be great in the future.

Mikhail says, “I decided to run (to participate in these elections) because I wanted to be a voice of reason in the partisan bick ering.”  Mikhail decided to try to become a representative, or elected to whatever this office is that he’s trying to gain, because he wanted to be a voice of reason.  “ Reason” is using your intelligence – your intellect.  “To be a voice of r eason” is to be a person who presents rational, logical ideas, someone who doesn ’t act just emotionally, someone who thinks about what they are doing.  That ’s a “voice of reason.” Mikhail wants to be the voice reason in the partisa n bickering.  “Partisan” (partisan) is when you have very strong opinions of  one political party.  Someone who doesn’t want to change their opinions, who supp orts their political party, and they won’t change their mind; that would be someone  who is “partisan.”  “To bicker” (bicker) means to fight, to disagree, espec ially in a way that isn’t very pleasant – that isn’t very nice.  So “bickering,” a s a noun, would be fighting. Mikhail says, “I didn’t sign on (I didn’t agree) to  be a poster boy for my political party.”  A “poster boy” or a “poster girl,” we migh t even say a “poster child,” is a person who represents an organization, who symboliz es the organization.  It’s sometimes used to refer to someone who is a good ex ample of a certain idea or a certain belief.  Sometimes organizations that are  trying to get money for people who need help, who are sick, for example, from a sp ecific disease, may have pictures of a person who that has that disease on a  piece of paper, a large piece of paper that has their name on it, the name of the  organization, asking for help. Well, a large piece of paper like that is called a “poster,” and that’s where we get the expression “poster boy” or “poster child.”  Mik hail doesn’t want to be a poster boy for his “political party,” for his organization  of members who support a certain political belief.

Helen says, “You can make a difference (that is, yo u can do something important) when you get elected (when people vote f or you so that you win your

position), but first things first.”  The expression  “first things first” means you have to do the most important things first; you have to put things in priority and start with the most important thing first – “first things  first.”  Helen says, “you need to get elected.  Ready to go?”

Mikhail says, “What happened to the good old days w hen all you had to do was a little gerrymandering to get elected?”  “Good old d ays” is an expression referring to the way things used to be, things that you remem ber favorably, you remember them being better than they are right now.  So I ma y say something like, “Oh, the good old days when you could go to the beach and no  one would be talking on their cell phone, or go to a baseball game and ever yone would watch the game instead of texting their friends or waving to the c amera.”  “The good old days,” the days when things were better.  Mikhail says, “W hat happened to the good old days when all you had to do (when the only thing yo u needed to do) was a little gerrymandering?”  “To gerrymander” (gerrymander) is  to make the lines on a map for a specific area of a government representat ive in such a way that you make sure that only certain kinds of people will wi n in that area.  It’s somewhat complicated.  In American politics every 10 years o r so, as the population moves, increases, or decreases, each state has to draw the  boundaries of the elected officials.  So for example, here in Los Angeles we may have seven or eight people that go to Congress representing us.  Each o ne represents a specific area of Los Angeles.  But where you draw the lines divid ing those areas will make a big difference in who gets elected.  “Gerrymanderin g” is drawing those lines in such a way that you guarantee that only a certain k ind of person will get elected, someone from either a conservative political party or a liberal political party, for example.

Helen says, “I’m glad you brought that up (I’m glad  you mentioned that).  Your meeting with the committee on redistricting is this  afternoon at 2:00.” “Redistricting” is that process I just talked about , every 10 years or so where the government – the state governments have to go throu gh and decide where the lines are going to be.  So, that’s exactly what is happening here, “redistricting.” Mikhail says, “I’m sorry I asked!”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
