This episode is a dialogue between Ana Maria and Gi o about helping someone who needs help. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ana Maria: Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?

Gio: That’s his own fault. Who told him to meddle i n other people’s business?

Ana Maria: He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow  human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.

Gio: Doing a good deed, was he? Going out on a limb  to help someone in need, eh?

Ana Maria: Exactly. I call him a hero.

Gio: I call him a fool. You don’t put yourself in d anger to help a stranger. That’s just common sense.

Ana Maria: So you would have just walked right by a nd done nothing to help.

Gio: If it meant putting myself in jeopardy. You sh ould always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.

Ana Maria: Great, remind me never to get into a lif eboat with you!

Ana Maria asks Gio, “Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?” The term “Good Samaritan” nowadays refers to a kind person, specifically some one who will stop and help someone whom they don’t know who needs help. The te rm comes from a story from the Christian Bible, specifically from the boo k of St. Luke in the New Testament of the Bible. It’s what is called one of the “parables,” or stories, that Jesus told in the Bible.

A Good Samaritan refers then to someone who helps a nother person who needs help, even someone the person doesn’t know. That’s what happened in this news story that Ana Maria is talking about. Unfortu nately, the person who stopped to help the stranger died. A “stranger” (st ranger) is a person you don’t know, a person who you have never met before. Gio, however, doesn’t feel sorry for the Good Samaritan. He says, “That’s his own fa ult.”

When you say something is someone’s “own (own) faul t (fault),” you mean that the person himself is responsible for his problems.  The word “fault” here refers to “blame.” If I say, “It’s your fault” or “It’s your own fault,” I mean you are the person responsible for the bad thing that happen to you. I f you have a test tomorrow, an examination tomorrow, and you don’t prepare for it and then you do very poorly on that exam, I will say, “Well, it’s your own faul t. You didn’t study. You are the person who is responsible for your poor performance .”

Gio says, “Who told him,” meaning the Good Samarita n, “to meddle in other people’s business?” The verb “to meddle” (meddle) m eans to get involved in something that you should not be involved in or to try to influence other people’s activities or decisions. “To meddle” is usually a v erb we use when we are criticizing another person’s actions, saying the ot her person should not have done this because it was none of his business.

Ana Maria says, “He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.” T he word “fellow” (fellow) as an adjective refers to someone who is in the same cate gory or group as you are or as another person about whom you’re speaking. For e xample, I can talk about my “fellow Californians.” These are other people wh o are also, like I am, from California or who live in California now. I could t alk about “the Queen of England and her fellow Britons” – that is, people who, like  the Queen of England, are also British, are also considered part of that group.

All of us are human beings, except you cats out the re. Therefore, “to stop and help a fellow human being” is to stop and help some one who is part of the same group as you are. The Good Samaritan in our story s topped to help a fellow human being who “was in distress.” “To be in distre ss” (distress) is to be in a crisis, to need help, to be perhaps very unhappy or  worried because of some situation you are in. The Good Samaritan was “selfl ess” (selfless). “To be selfless” means not to think about your own needs –  to help others even when it may hurt you.

Gio is not convinced. He says, “Doing a good deed, was he?” This is a form of what we call a “tag question.” It’s often used in t his form, and pronounced this way, when someone doesn’t really believe what the o ther person is saying. And that’s the case with Gio. He doesn’t really think t his person was doing a good deed. What’s a “good deed” (deed)? It’s an action y ou do for another person that will help that person even though you don’t get any thing for it yourself.

Gio says, “Going out on a limb to help someone in n eed, eh?” Once again, he’s asking this as a question, but in a way he’s just e xpressing his doubt. The phrase “to go out on a limb” (limb) – notice the “b” is no t pronounced – means to take a risk, to do something that may cause you harm. This  person was “going out on a limb,” doing something risky, in order to help a pe rson “in need” – that is, someone who needed help.

Ana Maria says, “Exactly,” meaning yes, that is in fact what he was doing, even though Gio doesn’t believe it. She says, “I call hi m a hero” (hero). A “hero” is someone who does something brave, something that re quires courage, and therefore is someone whom you would admire and resp ect. Gio says, “I call him a fool” (fool). A “fool” is someone who isn’t very smart or who does something without thinking rationally or clearly.

Gio continues, “You don’t put yourself in danger to  help a stranger.” “To put yourself in danger” (danger) is to do something tha t may cause you harm, that may hurt you. If you are driving down a freeway, a highway, and you are drunk – you’ve had too much to drink – you’re putting yourself in danger. You may hurt yourself. In fact, you’re putting other people in d anger, too. Don’t do that.

Gio says that you should not put yourself in danger  to help a stranger. “That’s just common sense,” Gio says. “Common sense” refers  to the ordinary or regular ability of people to make good decisions. Something  that everyone knows is a good idea is “common sense.” Ana Maria then says, “ So you would have just walked right by and done nothing to help?”

Gio says, “If it meant putting myself in jeopardy,”  meaning yes, he would have just walked right by and done nothing to help if he lping the person would have put him in jeopardy. “To be put in jeopardy” (jeopa rdy) is to put yourself in danger. Gio is saying here that if he thought he wa s going to be in jeopardy, in danger, he would not have helped the man – the stra nger who needed help. We’re not sure if it’s a man or a woman. Gio says, “You should always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.”

Gio believes you should always look out for yoursel f. “To look out for yourself” means to protect yourself first and not worry about  anyone else around you. Ana Maria says, “Great, remind me never to get into a l ifeboat with you.” A “lifeboat” (lifeboat) is a small boat carried on a larger boat , or ship, that is used if the larger boat is having problems and you need to leave it. I f you are on a large boat or ship, you will usually have lifeboats that will be used to get off of that boat if the larger boat or ship is sinking or has some sort of serious problem.

Ana Maria is making a joke here. She says, “Remind me never to get into a lifeboat with you,” meaning she doesn’t want to be in a lifeboat with Gio because Gio won’t help anyone else if there is a serious pr oblem. He will look after himself or look out for himself before helping anyone else.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
