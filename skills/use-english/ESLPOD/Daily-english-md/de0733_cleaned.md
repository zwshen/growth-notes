This episode is a dialogue between Khaled and Berni ce.  They’re talking about voting in an election and use a lot of vocabulary w e might use to describe democratic elections.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Khaled:  Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again? 

Bernice:  I always vote with an absentee ballot so I can vote in the comfort of my own home and in my own time.  In fact, I’ve already  mailed in my ballot. 

Khaled:  Good for you.  Which candidate did you vot e for in the governor’s race? 

Bernice:  I didn’t vote for either of the bozos tha t are running.  I voted for a write- in candidate. 

Khaled:  A write-in candidate?  There isn’t a snowb all’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election. 

Bernice:  That may be so, but I have to vote with m y conscience, and I can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people.  Have yo u voted? 

Khaled:  Not yet.  I’m going to vote at the polls o n Election Day.  I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on t he ballot measures.  There are a lot of them this time. 

Bernice:  Yeah, but the governor’s race is the only  thing I care about.  I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos a s the next governor.  

 Khaled:  Just out of curiosity, who did you write i n as a candidate? 

Bernice:  You. 

Khaled:  Me?!  You’re crazy.  I don’t want to be go vernor. 

Bernice:  It was either you or me, and I’d rather n ot be a candidate and have to be in the company of those bozos. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Khaled saying to Bernice, “Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again?”  A “polling place” is a place usually in a school or a library – although here in  California it could be in someone’s garage or living room, a place where you go to fill out a piece of paper or enter information in a computer to vote in  an election.  So, a polling place is a place where you go and vote.  Where I’m from, in Minnesota, when I was growing up polling places were always in school s or the basement of churches or other buildings – community or public b uildings.  Here in California, for some reason, a lot of the polling places are in  homes.  I think part of the reason is for that safety reasons the schools don’t  want all of these adults coming into the school, people they don’t know.   

So Khaled is asking Bernice if she is going to go t o her polling place or if she is going to “vote,” she’s going to indicate who she wa nts to be elected, by absentee ballot.  “To be absent” (absent) means you are not there, it’s the opposite of “present.”  “Absentee” refers to someone who isn’t there.  It can be used as an adjective, as it is here, to describe something or someone who isn’t physically present.  A “ballot” (ballot) is the piece of paper , traditionally, that you mark on that indicates who you want to win the election, an d you give that ballot to someone and then they count the ballots.  So, an “a bsentee ballot” is this piece of paper, but you aren’t actually there at the poll ing place; you mail the ballot in. So here in the United States, in many states you ca n vote by mail.  I always vote by mail.  They send me the ballot, I fill it out, I  put a stamp on it, I mail it back.  I don’t have to go anywhere on the day that the elect ion is officially, which is what we would call “Election Day.”  Pretty clever, huh? 

Bernice says, “I always vote with an absentee ballo t so I can vote in the comfort of my own home,” meaning I can be comfortable, I do n’t have to go out anywhere.  She also likes voting by absentee ballot  so she can vote “in her own  

time,” meaning when she wants to do something, when  something is convenient to her.  Bernice says, “In fact, I’ve already maile d in my ballot.” 

Khaled says, “Good for you.  Which candidate did yo u vote for in the governor’s race?”  A “candidate” is a person who wants to be e lected to a position.  The “governor” is the leader or head of the state.  Our  governor used to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, now it’s a man by the name of Jerry  Brown here in California, as I am recording this in 2011.  Khaled wants to kn ow who Bernice voted for in the governor’s race.  We use the word “race” (race)  here to mean an election.  It can also mean a competition between two people.  “R ace” has a number of other meanings also in English, and those can be found in  our Learning Guide. 

Bernice says, “I didn’t vote for either of the bozo s that are running.”  A “bozo” (bozo) is here meant to mean a clown, more generall y an unintelligent person who is not doing his or her job very well, who does  a very poor job at something. So, she’s describing the candidates as bozos.  It’s  kind of like saying they’re idiots.  “I voted for a write-in candidate,” Bernic e says.  There are certain rules for being elected and being on the ballot in the United  States.  However sometimes, people don’t want to vote for anyone who is officia lly on the ballot, and so they will write someone’s name in.  This is perfectly le gal.  In some states you have to register your name if you want to be a write-in can didate, even though your name is not printed on the ballot.  Here in California, you can write in someone’s name, someone who is not officially on the ballot.  These  people almost never win, but some people like to do it as a protest to say, “I d on’t like any of you people.”  I have often written in candidates here for elections ! 

Khaled says, “A write-in candidate?  There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election.”  The phrase “a snowball’s chance in hell” means absolutely no chance, no possibility , or simply impossible.  It’s impossible for a write-in candidate to win this ele ction, that’s what Khaled is saying.  A “snowball” is cold; it’s made from basic ally frozen water, or water crystals.  “Hell” in the Christian religion is wher e you go if you’re a bad person after you die, and traditionally it’s been thought of as a very hot place.  So, if you put a snowball in a hot place, of course the snowba ll will melt; it will disappear; it will become water and no longer be a snowball.  So,  a snowball’s chance in hell means no chance, because, of course, it would not b e able to survive. 

Khaled says, “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in he ll that a write-in candidate is going to win this election,” this race, this compet ition.  Bernice says, “That may be so, but I have to vote with my conscience, and I  can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people.”  Your “conscience” is your  sense of right and wrong; what is the right thing to do, the correct thing to do, the ethical thing to do, and what is  

the wrong thing to do.  Bernice says, “I can’t brin g myself to vote for either of those people.”  This expression, “to not be able to  bring yourself to do (something)” means that you can’t do it because you  think it is wrong, you can’t even force yourself to do it because you think it i s such a bad idea.  We might say, “Oh, she looks so happy.  I can’t bring myself  to tell her any bad news today.”  I just can’t do it. 

Then Bernice asks Khaled, “Have you voted?” and he says, “Not yet.  I’m going to vote at the polls on Election Day.”  He’s going to go to the polling place and vote on the day of the election, Election Day.  He says, “I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on the ballot  measures.”  “To read up on (something)” means to learn about something by read ing about it: reading information, reading books, websites, and so forth.   A “ballot measure” is a proposal for a new law that the people vote on dire ctly.  Normally you vote for people, and those people – those representatives vo te on the laws for your state or your city or your country.  However, sometimes i n American elections the people vote directly on a law.  It might be a law t o allow gambling or it might be a law to increase taxes.  Just about any kind of law can be voted on directly by the people in some states; not all states have this sys tem.  Khaled says, “There are a lot of them this time,” a lot of ballot measures.  Here in California, we always have many, many ballot measures; I think at least 5  or 10 every election.  These are laws that we are being asked to vote on directl y. 

Bernice says, “Yeah, but the governor’s race is the  only thing I care about.”  She only cares about who wins the election for governor .  She says, “I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos as the next  governor.”  Bernice says, “I can’t stand.”  This means I cannot tolerate, I cann ot find acceptable.  “To be able to stand (something)” is to be able to tolerate it,  often because it is difficult.  We say, “I can’t stand it,” meaning I can no longer do  this, I can no longer be in this situation.  You might say, “I can’t stand the hot w eather.”  “I hate it” is another way of saying that. 

Khaled says, “Just out of curiosity (just because I  want to know), who did you write in as a candidate?”  Remember, Bernice was go ing to write the name of someone in and not vote for the people whose names were on the ballot. Bernice says, “You.”  Khaled says, “Me?!  You’re cr azy.  I don’t want to be governor.”  Bernice responds, “It was either you or  me, and I’d rather not be a candidate and have to be in the company of those bo zos.”  “To be in the company of (someone)” means to spend time with some one, or to be in the same place as someone.  Bernice really doesn’t like the candidates; she calls them “bozos” no less than three times! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Khaled:  Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again? 

Bernice:  I always vote with an absentee ballot so I can vote in the comfort of my own home and in my own time.  In fact, I’ve already  mailed in my ballot. 

Khaled:  Good for you.  Which candidate did you vot e for in the governor’s race?
