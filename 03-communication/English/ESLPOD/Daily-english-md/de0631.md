This episode is called “Customizing a Personal Webpage.”  Many people have their own pages – their own websites.  We’ll talk about  some of the vocabulary that might be related to that, especially on social net working sites such as Facebook.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Keiko:  The layout of your webpage is so lame.  Why do n’t you customize it?

Al:  Why bother?  I don’t want to spend the time or the energy.

Keiko:  Let me show you my page.  Check out this background.   Don’t you think it’s great?

Al:  Yeah, it’s great.  Can I get back to my book now?

Keiko:  You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at this.   You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to list i nformation about yourself: your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, your mood, everything!  You can link to or upload photos and videos, too.  I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text across the top

Al:  Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.

Keiko:  You haven’t even seen my animated gifs.  This funn y baby will dance across the page, look!

Al:  Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick to a simple, uncluttered page. How long did it take you to do all of that?

 Keiko:  How long?  Maybe a few hours.

Al:  I’d rather spend a few hours reading a good book.

Keiko:  Suit yourself.  Maybe that’s why you have 22 “frie nds” and I have 200.

Al:  Clearly your time has been better spent.

Our dialogue begins with Keiko saying to Al, “The layout  of your webpage is so lame.”  The “layout” is the position of things either o n a piece of paper or here on the computer screen: where you have your photos, where yo u have your writing – your text.  The position of things on the screen or on  a page, in this case a webpage, is the layout.  “Lame” (lame) used to mean, a nd still does, someone who has injured themselves, someone who is handicapped, w ho hurt their arm or their leg.  Now it’s used more informally as meaning un interesting, boring, not cool.  “Lame” is a little bit dated now, it was more p opular I think in the 90s, but it’s still used.  Keiko says, “Why don’t you customize it?” me aning the webpage. “To customize (something)” is to change something so that i t is unique; it is unlike anything else.  Here it means also, I think, to pe rsonalize, to make the page reflect the person behind it.  That is, the page will somehow show you who this person is.

Al says, “Why bother?”  “Why bother?” is an informal phra se used to show that you think the suggestion that someone is giving you is a wa ste of time; you don’t want to do it.  You can use it by itself, “Why bother?”  or you can be more specific and say, “Why bother customizing my website?”  Notice that the verb after the word “bother” is an “ing” form.  “Why bother going to  the movies when you can watch the movie for free here on television?”  Al says, “I  don’t want to spend the time or the energy.”

Keiko says, “Let me show you my page.  Check out this backgro und.”  “Check out” means take a look at; investigate.  “Background” is t he large area of a piece of paper or a computer screen behind what you are looki ng at.  Normally it’s just white, but you could have different colored backgrounds.  The background is what everything else is on, if you will, in this case.  “B ackground” has a couple of different meanings, however; take a look at the Learn ing Guide for some additional explanations.  She says, “Don’t you think it’s g reat?”  Don’t you think my page is great Keiko means.  Al says, “Yeah, it’s great.   Can I get back to my

 book now?”  “Can I get back to” means I want to return to doing what I was doing before.  We often say it when we are trying to indicate  to the other person that they are bothering us, they are taking up our time.

Keiko says, “You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at t his.  You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to li st information about yourself.”  “Graphics” are small pictures or symbols that a re used to make something more interesting looking, a design, pattern t hat also can sometimes make the writing clearer; it indicates what is going on in the writing part of a piece of paper or a page on the web.  The “profile editor ” is something that you will find in social networking websites such as Facebook or Twitter th at allows you to control the information that other people see about you.  It will allow you to select information that you want to tell other people, and who gets to see that information.  The information on this profile editor , according to Keiko, includes your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, and your mood. Your “hometown” (one word) is the place where you were  born, the place where you grew up.  My hometown is St. Paul, Minnesota.  Your  “likes and dislikes” are, obviously, the things that you like and the things that you  don’t like.  Your “relationship status” is whether you are married; whet her you are single; whether you are dating, you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend; it could that you are engaged, you are going to get married; it could be th at you are divorced, you used to be married; or it could be that you are widowe d, your husband or wife died.  That’s your relationship status.  Your “mood” (mo od) is the way you feel at a particular moment in time.  I’m in a good mood mea ns I’m happy, I’m in a bad mood means I’m sad or angry.

Keiko says, “You can link to or upload photos and videos, t oo.”  “To link to (something)” means to make your webpage – a part of yo ur webpage such that when you click on it, it takes you to a different page or  a different part of a page. We call these “hyperlinks,” usually they are underlined on a website, and often a different color, blue is most common.  That is to link to something.  “To upload” means to put a file, like a picture or a music file, ont o another computer called a “server,” and that server is connected to the Internet so  that other people can look at or download that file.  Download is the oppo site of upload.  Upload you put it up to a server – you put it on a server; to dow nload means you take it off – you make it part of your own computer.

Keiko says, “I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text  across the top.” Something that is “custom,” as we learned earlier with the verb “customize,” is something that is special to you, something that is unlike other things.  A “cursor” (cursor) is a special graphic on your computer screen that t ells you where the

 mouse is or where whatever you may be typing will appear.   Keiko says she has a custom cursor and scrolling text.  “Text” is just another word for words. “Scrolling” is something that moves across the screen or up and down the screen, usually somewhat slowly.  At the end of a movie or  a television program, for example, there are what are called “credits,” the list of names of all the people who worked on that movie or show, and these usually “scroll ,” meaning they move slowly.  Especially for a movie you see this more often , the names will go from the bottom of the screen slowly up to the top of t he screen almost as if they were on a wheel, turning around.  That’s scrolling text .

Al says, “Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.”  “Di zzying” (dizzying) means something that makes you feel dizzy.  “To feel dizzy” means th at your head is sort of spinning; you are not exactly sure where you are p erhaps.  If someone hits you on the back of the head or spins you around in a  circle, around and around, you may get dizzy.  You won’t be able to walk stra ight, at least for a few minutes.  Here, “dizzying” means that it’s too complicated,  it’s too much, and it is confusing to Al.

Keiko says, “You haven’t even seen my animated gifs (or jif s).”  The word (gif) is actually an acronym.  It is a word that comes from differ ent words – the first letter of three different words; (gif) stands for graphics inte rchange format.  It’s pronounced by some people as “jif,” other people prono unce it “gif.”  I think “jif” is the original pronunciation.  In any case, it is a small f ile that is a picture or a photo or a design of some type.  “Animated” means that it is moving somehow; there is movement in the little picture.  These were ver y popular when the web first got started in the 1990s.  I remember in 1993 or  4 when I first started using the Internet you would see a lot of these.  They are no t quite as common, fortunately, anymore, but that’s what Keiko has on her w ebpage.  She says, “This funny baby will dance across the page, look!”

Al says, “Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick t o a simple, uncluttered page.”  “To stick to” means I’m going to stay with what  I have right now, or I am going to only do this.  He’s going to stick to an unclutte red page.  “Uncluttered” means that it isn’t messy; it’s the opposite of confusing, it’s the opposite of too much, of disorder.  Uncluttered would be very simple, wit hout anything unnecessary on the page.

Al says, “How long did it take you to do all of that?”  Keiko says, “How long? Maybe a few hours.”  Al says, “I’d rather spend a few hou rs reading a good book.”  Keiko says, “Suit yourself (meaning you do what you  want to do; if that’s what you like).  Maybe that’s why you have 22 (quote unq uote) ‘friends’ and I

 have 200.”  On Facebook you can get friends, people who  are able to look at your website.  A friend isn’t necessarily a friend; it’s o ften just somebody who knows who you are.  Many people try to get as many friends as they can; that’s often a sign of what we call “narcissism,” which is the be lief that you are the most important thing in the world.  We have a lot of that  nowadays!

Anyway, Keiko has 200 friends on her social networking site,  probably Facebook, and Al only has 22.  Al says, “Clearly your time has been b etter spent.”  “Better spent” means used in a better way, in a more productive way.  However, Al is being sarcastic; he’s making a joke.  He means the opposite  of what he says. He’s saying that Keiko has wasted her time getting these webpages customized and having all of these quote unquote friends.  When we say “quote unquote” we mean in this case that they’re not really friends.  Once a gain it’s the opposite, in some ways, of what you are saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
