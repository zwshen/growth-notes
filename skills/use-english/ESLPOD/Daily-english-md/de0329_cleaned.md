This episode is called “Being Persuasive.”  “To be persuasive” means to try to convince someone that what you are saying is true or right, or to do something.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Sylvia:  How would you like to take my sister, Donna, to the movies this weekend?  You’d be doing me a favor.  Joon:  Why?  What’s wrong with her?    Sylvia:  Nothing is wrong with her!  She just broke up with her boyfriend of four years and she’s down in the dumps.  She’s shy, so I thought I’d try to set her up on a date.    Joon:  Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen things I’d rather do than to take out anyone’s little sister, including yours, no offense.      Sylvia:  You don’t know what you’re missing.  She may be shy, but she’s very pretty and witty.  If you met her, you wouldn’t need me to persuade you.    Joon:  I don’t know.  I’m not convinced.  Whenever someone sets me up on a blind date, they always tell me how great the woman is.  She never lives up to the hype.    Sylvia:  I’m not going to twist your arm, but if you’re on the fence, I have two free movie tickets to that new movie you want to see, just to sweeten the pot.
