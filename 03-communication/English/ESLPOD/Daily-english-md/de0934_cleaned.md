This episode is a dialogue between Jack and Chrissy  about watching a movie with special effects. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Chrissy: Wow, that movie was amazing, but I can’t b elieve that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I bet the French are really pissed. 

Jack: You’re kidding, right? They didn’t really blo w up the Eiffel Tower. They used special effects to make it look that way. 

Chrissy: Are you sure? It really looked like the re al thing. 

Jack: They used a scale model or a computer-generat ed image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechnics or other visual e ffects to create what you saw on the screen. It’s like a big optical illusion . I can’t believe you really thought they blew up the Eiffel Tower. 

Chrissy: Oh no, I didn’t. I was just kidding. But y ou have to admit that it was pretty cool that they got the real president of the  United States to kill that monster, right? 

Jack: You must be messing with my mind again. That wasn’t the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standin g in front of a green screen. They added the monster later in post-produc tion. 

Chrissy: Oh, right, sure. But you have to hand it t o them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City, right? 

Jack: Oh, boy . . .

Our dialogue begins with Chrissy saying, “Wow, that  movie was amazing, but I can't believe that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I  bet the French are really pissed.” “To blow up” something is to destroy it, t o make it explode. “Blow up” is a two-word phrasal verb, of course. It's used here to  indicate that something was destroyed, usually with a bomb or some sort of expl osive. Chrissy is saying that in the movie, they blew up the Eiffel Tower.  

The Eiffel Tower is the most famous monument of Par is – the most famous site in Paris. That's why Chrissy says, “I bet the Frenc h are really pissed.” “To be pissed” (pissed) is something of a vulgar term, whi ch we don't normally talk about on the episodes here. But it's here in our dialogue , so I'll explain that it means to be angry – to be very, very angry or upset. However , it's not a word you should use normally, especially in front of your boss or i n front of your family. A much better expression here would be “angry” or “upset,”  which is what this word means.  

Jack says, “You're kidding, right?” meaning “You're  joking, right?” He says, “They didn't really blow up the Eiffel Tower. They used s pecial effects to make it look that way.” “Special effects” are techniques that ar e used in television and movie production. You think something is happening, even though in reality it isn't. In this case, it looks like the Eiffel Tower is being destroyed in the movie, but Jack says no, that did not actually happen; they used sp ecial effects.  

He says they use special effects to "make it look t hat way.” He means they use special effects so that it appears as though the Ei ffel Tower were destroyed. Chrissy says, “Are you sure? It really looked like the real thing.” Immediately, we get the sense that Chrissy might not be the most in telligent person in this conversation. Jack says, “They used a scale model o r a computer-generated image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechni cs or other visual effects to create what you saw on the screen.”  

There are several somewhat difficult terms in that sentence. Let's go back to the beginning where Jack says, “They used a scale (scal e) model (model).” A “scale model” would be a small representation of an object , but it's not the real object. If you go to Paris, you can probably buy a little Eiff el Tower that's maybe three inches tall. It's not the actual Eiffel Tower. It's  what you might call a scale model. It looks exactly the same, but it is made to be a v ery small size. That's what Jack is saying they used in this movie.  

“Or,” he says, “they used a computer-generated imag e.” A “computer-generated image” would be something that you would create usi ng software on your computer. Jack says also that they added “some pyro technics or other visual effects.” “Pyrotechnics” (pyrotechnics) means firew orks – explosions that produce bright lights and colors and, typically, fi re. That's “pyrotechnics.”  

Jack says, “They may have used pyrotechnics or visu al effects.” “Visual effects” are just special effects that are not sound, but so mething that you see. “Visual” (visual) refers to that which you can see, or somet hing that can be seen. Jack continues, “It's like a big optical illusion.” An “ illusion” (illusion) is something that looks real but it isn’t. An “optical (optical) illu sion” is something that makes your eyes think something is going on when it isn't real ly going on. It looks like it's one thing, but it in fact is another thing. That would be an “optical illusion.” 

Jack says, “I can't believe you really thought they  blew up the Eiffel Tower.” Jack can't believe that Chrissy could be that stupid. Bu t Chrissy says, “Oh no, I didn't. I was just kidding.” Now Chrissy says that she wasn't  serious, that she knew that they didn't really blow up the Eiffel Tower – right . When we use that word “right” with the intonation that I just used, you’re really  saying “I don't believe you. I don't think that's true.”  

Chrissy says, “You have to admit that it was pretty  cool that they got the real president of the United States to kill that monster , right?” So now Chrissy says something else incredibly stupid. She says that the  real president of the United States killed the monster in the movie. A “monster”  (monster) is a large, ugly, imaginary creature, an animal that doesn't really e xist but that you are very scared of. If you remember the movie Frankenstein , Frankenstein was what we would call a monster – kind of like my neighbor.  

Jack says, “You must be messing with my mind again. ” Jack is saying to Chrissy that she is “messing” with his mind. “To mess” (mes s) with someone's mind means to try to trick another person, try to fool a nother person, try to get someone to believe something is true that really is n't true. It's somewhat of an informal expression. “To mess with” in general mean s to interfere with or to cause problems with. It could be used in a physical  sense. “To mess with” someone would be perhaps to fight them, to hit them .  

There's an old expression: “Don't mess with Texas.”  “Don't mess with Texas” means don't get into a fight or criticize or anger anyone from the state of Texas. The state of Texas, which is located in the south-c entral part of the United States on the border with Mexico, has a reputation of bein g a state that has a lot of  

pride, where everything is bigger – at least, that' s what they think in Texas. But we’re not dealing with Texas here. We’re dealing wi th Chrissy.  

Jack says, “That wasn't the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standing in front of a green screen.” “Prost hetics” (prosthetics) are artificial body parts used sometimes for people who  lose their arms or lose one of their legs. Here, it's something that an actor woul d put on to make him look different. “Makeup” is something you would put typi cally on your face to make you look different. Women put makeup on to make the m look more beautiful.  

A “green screen” is a wall that is green. A “green screen” is used in movie and television production in order to put a different b ackground behind the person – but that is done after you actually make the film, after you actually film the video. You then can go back, if the background is green, a nd change what is behind the person so that it looks like something different.  

Jack says, “They added the monster later in post-pr oduction.” “Post-production” is the final stages, the final steps in making a mo vie or a television show or a record or a podcast. “Post-production” is what happ ens after you do the recording. It's all of the things that happen to ge t the recording – whether it's audio or visual – ready to release, ready to publis h. 

Chrissy says, “Oh, right, sure, but you have to han d it to them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City , right?” The expression “to hand (hand) it to” someone means to compliment them , to say that they did something very well. Chrissy is saying that in the movie, they took a section of the Great Wall of China and moved it to New York Ci ty. That's what Chrissy thinks. That's why she says, “You have to hand it t o them.” You have to congratulate the people who made the movie for doin g such an amazing thing.  

Of course, that's not actually what happened, but t hat's what Chrissy thinks. That's why Jack ends our dialogue by saying, “Oh, b oy.” That expression, “Oh, boy” is when you are frustrated, or you can't belie ve how stupid the other person is, or you can't believe the crazy ideas that the o ther person has. Chrissy certainly has some crazy ideas.  

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Chrissy: Wow, that movie was amazing, but I can’t b elieve that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I bet the French are really pissed.  

 Jack: You’re kidding, right? They didn’t really blo w up the Eiffel Tower. They used special effects to make it look that way.

Jack: Oh, boy . . .

We hope that our scriptwriter never messes with our  minds. I don't think she would. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Luc y Tse.
