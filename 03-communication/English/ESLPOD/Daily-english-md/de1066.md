This episode of the ESL Podcast is about buying a “ luxury” – or very expensive and nice – automobile. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Narin: This car is amazing.

Daniel: I know. It has every luxury option availabl e.

Narin: This sumptuous interior is so comfortable.

Daniel: You haven’t seen anything yet. It has a cli mate control system for every seat and a voice-activated entertainment system. It  also has the best navigation system money can buy. Let me turn this car on with the remote starter.

Narin: That’s impressive. How does it drive?

Daniel: It drives like a dream. It has the most res ponsive handling of any car I’ve driven, and it has such a smooth ride you’d hardly know we’re moving.

Narin: You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.

Daniel: And this car is safe, too. It has seven air  bags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rear co llisions.

Narin: Can you give me a ride home?

Daniel: No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gone.

Narin: Couldn’t you just tell him you were taking a  potential customer out on a test drive?

Daniel: Again?

Our dialogue begins with Narin saying to Daniel, “T his car is amazing” – this car is wonderful. Daniel says, “I know. It has every lu xury option available.” An “option” is one possibility among many. The word “l uxury” here is used to mean very nice and very expensive.

Narin says, “This sumptuous interior is so comforta ble.” She’s saying that the inside of the car – the “interior” of the car, wher e the seats are – is “so comfortable,” is very comfortable. The word “sumptu ous” (sumptuous) is similar to the word “luxurious.” They both mean expensive l ooking, very nice – very, in this case, comfortable.

Daniel says, “You haven’t seen anything yet.” This expression, “You haven’t seen anything yet,” means there is even something better  about this particular item or thing. Daniel says, “It” – meaning the car – “has a  climate control system for every seat.” The word “climate” (climate) usually d escribes the weather, the atmosphere, the way things are outside. Is it rainy ? Is it snowy? That is related to climate – how the general weather patterns are in a  given area. Here in Southern California, we have a desert climate in part of the  area, where it’s very dry and warm.

Well, here we’re talking about climate in a little different way. We’re talking more about the atmosphere or environment of a certain pl ace. “Climate control systems” in a car are ways of controlling the tempe rature of, in this case, the seats in the car. So, you could actually have one s eat that was hotter than another. Weird, I know, but that’s what some cars a llow you to do if they have a climate control system.

Another thing that Daniel points out about this car  is that it has a “voice-activated entertainment system.” The word “activated” comes f rom the verb “to activate” (activate). “To activate” means to start something or to get something functioning or working. If something is “voice-activated,” it t urns on and off and does what you want it to do just by talking to it, just by sp eaking to it.

 A lot of modern cell phones, especially what are ca lled “smart phones,” have voice-activated features. You can say something and  the phone will do something. There are other kinds of technology that  use voice activation. Daniel is talking about an “entertainment system” in a car , probably things like the CD or MP3 player.

Daniel says, “The car also has the best navigation system money can buy.” A “navigation system” is a part of the car that usual ly gives you a map and directions about how to get from where you are now to where you want to go. More commonly, at least in the United States, this is called a “GPS” system, for “global positioning system.” In other countries, th ey might use different terms. In Great Britain, sometimes they use the term “Sat Nav ” for “Satellite Navigation.” The word “navigation” in general is used to mean ho w you get from one place to another.

Daniel concludes by saying, “Let me turn this car o n with the remote starter.” A “starter” (starter) in this case is something that starts the engine, that gets the motor or the engine running, or working. The word “ remote” (remote) in general means something that is from a distance to another thing. If you have a television, you probably have what we would call a “remote control,” or simply a “remote.” It’s a way of controlling the television without having to get up, walk across the room, and change the channel or the volu me.

You know, kids, that’s how we used to do it back wh en I was younger. You actually had to get out of your chair in order to t urn the channel on the television. Crazy, right? I know. Well, now some cars, instead of using a key that you put into a part of the car to start the engine, have re mote starters – things that you can use to start your car even if you’re not in the  car. Why would you want to start your car if you’re not in it? I have no idea,  but you can do it, and that’s the important thing.

Narin says, “That’s impressive.” Something that is “impressive” is something that you think is great, is amazing. She then asks Danie l, “How does it drive?” meaning is it a comfortable drive when you ride in the car? Do you feel comfortable? Does it move fast when you want it to go fast? And so forth. Daniel says, “It drives like a dream.” A “dream” is normal ly something you have when you’re sleeping. It’s something that is part of you r imagination, but here it’s used to mean it’s wonderful. It’s excellent.

He says that the car “has the most responsive handl ing of any car I’ve driven.” The word “responsive” (responsive) is related to the verb “to respond” (respond).

“To respond” means to react when someone else says something or does something. If someone asks you a question, you answ er the question by responding. The person says something to you; you s ay something back to the person. “Responsive,” then, has to do with how well  something reacts.

The word “handling” (handling) refers, in general, to how easy it is to control the car. You know, sometimes you have cars where, when you turn the steering wheel (the round wheel that you turn inside the car  in order to make it go to the left or to the right) the car turns right away. You  have other cars where you have to turn the wheel a lot in order to get the car to turn one direction or the other.

I used to own, many years ago, an old station wagon . It was a big, long car and it was sort of like riding in a boat or a ship. You’d turn the wheel and it would take a long time for the car to move left or right. Well, that’s what we’re talking about when we refer to “responsive handling” of a car. Da niel says, “The car has a smooth ride.” A “ride” (ride) here refers simply to  how comfortable the car is. “Smooth” (smooth) is an adjective meaning that it’s  very comfortable. There aren’t a lot of up and downs, a lot of bumps that y ou feel when you are riding in the car.

Narin (who’s I guess now in the car, riding in it) says, “You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.” A “cloud” is that white material that you see up in the sky from which we get rain and snow and other forms of water. Nari n compares driving in the car, or riding in the car, to riding on a cloud, wh ere you seem to go by very smoothly like a cloud might in the sky.

Daniel says, “And this car is safe, too. It has sev en airbags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rea r collisions.” “Airbags” are these bags that blow up, or inflate, if your car is in an  accident. The airbags prevent you from hurting yourself – at least, that’s what they’ re supposed to do. An “alert system for blind spots” refers to usually a compute r in the car that will tell you if there is someone in your blind spot. Your “blind (b lind) spot” is the area next to your car that is difficult to see in the mirrors of  the car.

That’s why whenever you, for example, change from o ne lane to another, from one part of the street or highway to another, you s hould always look behind you and to your side to make sure there isn’t another c ar there. Sometimes you don’t see the car there in your mirrors. So some cars, I guess, have these alert systems for blind spots. I have in my car, usually,  an alert system. I call it “my wife.” She will yell and scream if I’m about to hit  another car. It works very well and it’s a lot cheaper than most of these new cars.  Well, a little cheaper.

Anyway, Daniel is talking about an alert system for  blind spots, and he says that this alert system helps avoid front and rear collis ions. A “collision” (collision) is when one car hits another. It’s an accident, or a “ crash,” we might call it. Narin says, “Can you give me a ride home?” Daniel says, “ No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gon e.” So now we understand the story. Daniel doesn’t own this car; he works at a p lace that sells cars. We would call it a “car lot” (lot), and he’s borrowed this c ar and is probably trying to impress this girl by the name Narin.

Narin says, “Couldn’t you just tell him,” meaning t he boss, “you were taking a potential customer out on a test drive?” A “test dr ive” is when you go to a car lot to buy a car and drive in the car before you buy it . You want to see if you like the car or not, so you take it on a test drive. Narin i s suggesting, then, that Daniel just tell his boss that he was out with the car with a p otential customer. A “customer” is someone who buys something. A “potential custome r” is someone who might buy something.

Daniel responds to Narin’s suggestion by saying, “A gain?” The idea is that he has already used this excuse before when he has, we  are guessing, taken cars out of the car lot to drive.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
