This episode is a dialogue between Julian and Vera about getting old. Let's get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Julian: What is that, another gray hair?! My hair i s already thinning on top. I don’t need more gray hairs. 

Vera: I think salt and pepper hair looks great on m en. It makes them look distinguished. 

Julian: It makes them look old. Thank God I don’t h ave a receding hairline – yet. 

Vera: When you get to be my age, you won’t worry so  much about graying hair. There are a lot of other things to worry about. 

Julian: Like what? 

Vera: Forget I mentioned it. Showing signs of age i sn’t something to be lamented. It’s natural and part of maturing as a pe rson. It gives you character.  

Julian: Stop being evasive. Like what? 

Vera: Okay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness a nd memory loss. 

Julian: Gee, thanks. If I ever need to talk someone  off a ledge, I’ll give you a call! 

[end of dialogue] 

Julian begins by saying, “What is that, another gra y hair?” A “gray hair” is a hair that has changed color because someone is getting o ld. It's usually not gray; it's more like white hair. If you have a lot of white ha ir or gray hair, it may mean – not always – but it may mean that you are getting old.  

Julian says, “My hair is already thinning on top.” The verb “to thin” refers here to hair that is falling out of your head – out of the top of your head, what we would call your “scalp” (scalp). Your “scalp” is the skin  on the top of your head. As you get older, sometimes the hair begins to fall out an d doesn't grow back. So, you have less hair on the top of your head than you did  when you were younger. This is certainly true for people like me.  

Julian says, “I don't need more gray hairs.” Vera s ays, “I think salt and pepper hair looks great on men.” The expression “salt and pepper hair” refers to hair that is both black and white. Some of it is black or bro wn. Some of it is white due to the graying of the hair. “Salt,” of course, is whit e. Pepper is black. So, that's where we get the expression “salt and pepper hair.”  That's what Vera is talking about.  

She thinks that salt and pepper hair “looks great o n men. It makes them look distinguished.” “To be distinguished” means to be d ignified. If you are distinguished, you get respect from other people. I t looks like you are someone of importance, someone who has authority. Julian doesn 't agree with Vera. He says, “It makes them look old,” meaning the salt an d pepper hair makes men look old. 

He says, “Thank God I don't have a receding hairlin e – yet.” Your “hairline” (hairline) is what separates, on the top of your he ad, the part where you have hair and the part where there is just skin. So, if you start at your eyes and you move up on the top of your head past your forehead,  most people eventually will have hair somewhere at the top of the head. The lin e that separates the hair from the skin that has no hair is called your “hairline. ”  

The verb “to recede” (recede) means to move back. A  “receding hairline,” then, is a hairline that appears to be moving back, because you're losing more and more hair on the front part of your head. Julian says he  does not have a receding hairline yet. That word “yet” means that he expects  probably, someday, that that will happen as well.  

Vera says, “When you get to be my age” – when you a re as old as I am – “you don't worry so much about graying hair. There are a  lot of other things to worry about.” Julian says, “Like what?” He means, “Give m e some examples of other  

things I have to worry about as I get older.” Vera says, “Forget I mentioned it.” She says, “Forget I mentioned it,” because she's co mmunicating to Julian that he doesn't really want to know – that the news is very  bad and he will probably be better off not knowing this bad news.  

She says, “Showing signs of age isn't something to be lamented.” “To show signs of age” means to see changes in your physical appea rance that indicate that you are getting older. That could mean getting gray hai r. It could mean losing your hair. It could mean that your skin is not as soft a s it used to be. It could mean that you are not able to run as fast as you used to. The re could be a lot of signs of old age. It could mean repeating things that you just s aid a minute ago. There could be a lot of signs of old age. It could mean we . . . wait a minute, am I repeating myself?  

Vera says that “old age is not something to be lame nted.” “To lament” (lament) means to feel sad about something, especially somet hing that you may have lost. Another word we use here would be “to mourn” (mourn ). Usually, mourning is something you do when someone dies. You feel sad th at you have lost that person. “Lamenting” is a more general term that cou ld be used to describe the loss of anything or the feeling of sadness because something has been lost or something bad has happened.  

Vera says it's a natural part of “maturing as a per son. It gives you character.” Vera is talking about showing signs of age. She say s, “It's natural and part of maturing as a person.” She’s saying that it's a nor mal part of getting older and wiser. “To mature” (mature) means to become older, but also to become wiser – to know more than you did when you were young.  

Vera says, “It gives you character” (character). “C haracter” here means personality, something that makes you different fro m other people. In this context, it's a positive thing. “To have character”  means to be a good person. It's a compliment to say that someone has a lot of chara cter. Vera says that showing signs of age “gives you character.”  

Julian then says, “Stop being evasive.” “To be evas ive” (evasive) means to hide something – to not give a clear, direct answer to s omeone's question. Julian repeats the question, “Like what?” He's asking for examples of other things one has to worry about as one gets older. Vera says, “O kay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness and memory loss.” “Wrinkles” (wrink les) are small “folds,” we call them, in your skin. They're sort of like small line s on your skin that form as you get older. I have lots of wrinkles already and I'm only 29.  

Another thing you get when you get older, according  to Vera, are “age spots.” “Age spots” are small areas on your skin that have a different color than the skin around it. It's often caused by being out in the su n too much. If you live in a place like Los Angeles, you may be out in the sun more th an people in other parts of the country, which is why you may see more people w ith age spots in California than you do in Minnesota, where it is less sunny.  

Vera says a couple of other problems of getting old  are “deafness and memory loss.” “Deafness” (deafness) is the inability to he ar. When you can't hear anything, that is a sign of deafness. Beethoven, th e great composer, was partially deaf and got more deaf as he got older, I believe. “Memory loss,” we've already talked about, is when you forget things, when you c an't remember something. That's memory loss.  

Julian says, “Gee, thanks.” That expression, “Gee, thanks,” is used sarcastically here. Julian isn't really thanking Vera. He's not h appy that Vera told him this information, but to be fair to Vera, she did tell J ulian that he didn't want to hear this bad news. That's why she was being evasive.  

Julian says, “If I ever need to talk someone off a ledge, I'll give you a call.” A “ledge” (ledge) is something you see on some buildi ngs, outside of a window or somewhere on the wall on the side of the building. A “ledge” is a horizontal space that comes out from the wall. It's at 90 degrees fr om the wall. The wall is vertical; it goes up and down. A ledge is horizontal. It goes  out from the side of the wall. Sometimes the ledge is big enough that you can actu ally walk on it.  

Now, if you are out on the ledge, however, you may be trying to kill yourself. You may be trying to jump off the ledge and kill yourse lf. So, that's the meaning behind Julian's statement here, “If I ever need to talk someone off a ledge.” “To talk someone off a ledge” would be to convince some one not to kill himself – to come away from the ledge, to come back into the bui lding to be safe.  

Julian is making a joke here. He is saying that Ver a is very depressing. Her news is very depressing, and he would not want her to be  talking to someone else who was depressed and who perhaps was trying to kill hi mself, because she is so depressing.  

That's why he says, “If I ever need to talk someone  off a ledge, I'll give you a call.” He's being sarcastic again. He's making a jo ke. He’s saying, really, “I will not call you because you are so depressing.” The pe rson will probably want to jump off the ledge after talking to you instead of coming back into the building.  

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
