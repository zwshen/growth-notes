# Types of Commendations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,285 – Types of Commendations. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,285. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

This episode is a dialogue between Marissa and Sant iago about types of commendations – rewards you give someone for doing a good job. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Marissa: Can you believe it? We’ve received over 10 0 entries for the science fair. 

Santiago: That’s great! We now need to decide what types of awards to hand out. 

Marissa: Everybody likes money. How about a cash pr ize? 

Santiago: We’re working with a very small budget he re. We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’m not sure that it would send the righ t message anyway. 

Marissa: The next best thing is a trophy. 

Santiago: We don’t have the budget for trophies if we plan to give out more than one commendation. 

Marissa: Then how about medals? 

Santiago: We can’t afford good ones and nobody want s a cheap plastic medal. 

Marissa: So I guess plaques are out, too? 

Santiago: I’m afraid so. I was thinking of ribbons,  different color ribbons for different prizes. What do you think? 

Marissa: I guess ribbons would be okay. After all, it’s the praise and recognition that matters. 

Santiago: Exactly. And for those getting honorable mentions, a certificate will do. We’ll also need certificates of participation for t he rest. 

Marissa: So everybody gets something? 

Santiago: That’s right. We don’t want anyone to lea ve empty-handed.  

Marissa: Even if their entry isn’t worthy of recogn ition? 

Santiago: All entries are worthy of recognition – j ust some more than others.

Marissa begins by saying, “Can you believe it? We’v e received over 100 entries for the science fair.” Marissa starts by saying, “C an you believe it?” We usually use that expression when something surprising happe ns, something that is unusual. What is unusual, apparently, is that Maris sa and her school have received 100 entries for a science fair.  

An “entry” (entry) is something usually that is giv en to someone in a competition so that other people can look at it or evaluate it.  Another word for “entry” would be a “submission” (submission). If you are having a n art contest, for example, and you want to find the best painter, you might as k each painter “to submit,” or to send in, a painting. That painting would be an e ntry in the competition.  

This is a science fair competition. A “science fair ” (fair) is a competition that some schools or organizations have for students, usually  young students – students that are in grade school or high school. A “science  fair” involves experiments and other things that students put together to show the y understand scientific concepts. Marissa is happy that they have more than  100 of these student entries.  

Santiago agrees. He says, “That’s great. We now nee d to decide what type of awards to hand out.” An “award” (award) is somethin g you give the winner of a competition or a game. The phrasal verb “to hand (h and) out” means to give to people, so if you are handing out awards, you are g iving people awards. If you’re handing out money, you are giving people money (and  you could give me some money if you’re handing out money). 

Marissa says, “Everybody likes money,” meaning she thinks perhaps they should give the winners of this science fair cash. She eve n says, “How about a cash prize?” that is, a prize that is basically money. S antiago says, “We’re working  

with a very small budget here,” which is another wa y of saying they don’t have a lot of money. “We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’ m not sure that would send the right message anyway.”  

The expression “to send the right message” (message ) means to communicate to other people what you think is important, or per haps what you believe in. Giving kids money for doing well in a science fair might not send the right message. We don’t want them to think they should do  well in school just because they’ll get money, but of course they want to give the students something.  

Marisa suggests that “the next best thing,” meaning  the next thing after money that would be good, “is a trophy” (trophy). A “trop hy” is an object that you give someone who wins an award – usually it is either a bowl or a cup, but it might also be a figure of a man or a woman that represent s victory. Here in Hollywood, the best movies and directors and actors will get a n Oscar. It’s a little trophy that represents their victory in a certain category for the Academy Awards, the awards given to the best movies and such every year . 

Santiago says, “We don’t have the budget for trophi es.” Once again, to say you “don’t have the budget (budget) for” something mean s you don’t have enough money for something. Santiago says they don’t have the budget for trophies “if we plan to give out,” or hand out, “more than one c ommendation.” A “commendation” (commendation) is any kind of award or praise that you give to someone who has won a contest or a competition.  

Marissa’s says, “Then how about medals?” A “medal” (medal) is a flat, often circular or round piece of metal (metal) that has w ords or images on it. It often looks like a little coin, and this round metal is t ypically worn on your shirt or jacket. Sometimes the medal is worn over your neck.  If you win a gold medal at the Olympics, you get a large round metal. Once aga in, you’ve probably seen these. They look like big coins that you wear aroun d your neck with a ribbon, a piece of fabric that is connected to the metal.  

Santiago says, “We can’t afford good ones,” meaning  good-quality medals, “and nobody wants a cheap” – inexpensive, that is – “pla stic medal.” Marisa says, “So I guess plaques are out, too?” A “plaque” (plaque) is usually a square or, in any case, rectangular piece of wood or metal that has t he name of the contest and often the name of the winner on it. When Marissa sa ys, “plaques are out,” she means that plaques are not possible either. Santiag o says, “I’m afraid so,” meaning yes, plaques are out, too. 

He then continues, “I was thinking of ribbons” (rib bons). A “ribbon” is a small rectangular piece of cloth, often with words on it – again, similar to a plaque except it’s made out of cloth and is much less expe nsive, much cheaper. Marissa says, “I guess ribbons would be okay. After all, it ’s the praise and recognition that matters.” Marissa is saying the actual prize is not  so important. It’s the “praise” – the saying of good things about you or whoever wins  – “and recognition that matters.”  

“Recognition” is when someone says, “Yes, you did a  good job.” “Recognition” is any time that someone says, publicly, “You did a go od job” – or in this case, “You won this award.” It’s the praise and recognition th at is important. Santiago says, “Exactly.” Santiago continues, “And for those,” mea ning those students, “getting honorable mentions, a certificate will do.”  

If you don’t win a prize at a school competition, y ou will sometimes be given an award that is called an “honorable mention.” An “ho norable mention” is given to anyone who does a good job in the contest but doesn ’t win it. Not all contests or competitions have honorable mentions, but some do, especially school competitions. A “certificate” (certificate) is a pi ece of paper that serves as an award or as a document showing that you’ve complete d something or won something.  

Santiago also mentions “certificates of participati on.” “Certificates of participation” are given to anyone who is part of a competition or  a contest. Again, not all competitions or contests have certificates of parti cipation given to the people who participate or take part in those contests, but man y do, especially school competitions. Marissa says, “So everybody gets some thing?” Santiago says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “We don’t w ant anyone to leave empty- handed.”  

The phrase “empty (empty) – handed (handed)” means without anything. If you leave “empty-handed,” you leave with nothing in you r hands – that is, you leave with nothing. You don’t get anything. “I went over to the beautiful woman to get her phone number but I left empty-handed,” meaning I didn’t get her phone number. Santiago doesn’t want any of the students t o leave empty-handed. Marissa says, “Even if their entry isn’t worthy of recognition?” “To be worthy” (worthy) means to be good enough to get something o r to be deserving something.  

Santiago says, “All entries are worthy of recogniti on – just some more than others.” Santiago is saying that anyone who sends i n an entry or participates in this science fair deserves something, gets somethin g to recognize or to  

acknowledge the participation of the student. Some,  however, are more worthy than others, meaning some deserve a prize more than  others. That’s why Santiago wants to give all of these different kinds  of prizes at different levels, I guess you could say.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
