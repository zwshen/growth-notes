<P>
Consider a graph <I>G</I> formed from a large number of nodes connected by
edges. <I>G</I> is said to be <EM>connected</EM> if a path can be found in 0 or
more steps between any pair of nodes in <I>G</I>.
For example, the graph below is not connected because there is no path
from <I>A</I> to <I>C</I>.
<P>

<P>
This graph contains, however, a number of subgraphs that are
connected, one for each of the following sets of nodes:
{<I>A</I>}, {<I>B</I>}, {<I>C</I>}, {<I>D</I>}, {<I>E</I>}, {<I>A</I>,<I>B</I>}, {<I>B</I>,<I>D</I>}, {<I>C</I>,<I>E</I>}, {<I>A</I>,<I>B</I>,<I>D</I>}
<P>
A connected subgraph is <EM>maximal</EM> if there are no nodes and edges
in the original graph that could be added to the subgraph and still
leave it connected. There are two maximal connected subgraphs above,
one associated with the nodes {<I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, <I>D</I>} and the other with the nodes
{<I>C</I>, <I>E</I>}.
<P>
Write a program to determine the number of maximal connected subgraphs
of a given graph.

<P>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is
followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive
inputs.
<P>
The first line of each input set contains a single uppercase
alphabetic character.  This character represents the largest node name
in the graph.
Each successive line contains a pair of uppercase alphabetic
characters denoting an edge in the graph. The sample input section contains a
possible input set for the graph pictured above.
<P>
Input is terminated by a blank line.
<P>For each test case, the output the number of maximal connected subgraphs. The
outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
