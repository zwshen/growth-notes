This episode is called “An Exclusive Guest List.”  A “guest list” is a list of people you are going to invite to a party.  Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Catherine:  Do you have a draft of the guest list?  We need to get the invitations out next week.

Ralph:  It’s not quite done yet.  I keep going back  and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.

Catherine:  Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.  She hasn’ t been in a movie for years. We only want people on the A-list at this party.

Ralph:  What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence  about him.

Catherine:  He’s definitely a D-lister.  This party  is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing elbows with VIPs.

Ralph:  I understand that, but what if we don’t get  enough A-listers to come?

Catherine:  That will not happen.  This party has t o be a success!

Ralph:  And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D- list celebrities?

Catherine:  There will always be gatecrashers.  We can let in a few to buff up the numbers, if push comes to shove.

 Ralph:  What happens to the exclusivity of the part y if that happens?

Catherine:  If that happens, this party has bombed and I don’t care if we even let in podcasters!

[end of dialogue]

Catherine begins our dialogue by saying to Ralph, “ Do you have a draft of the guest list?”  A “draft” (draft) of a list or a lett er or any other document is an early version of something; it’s not complete, it’s not f inal.  In school you often, especially in a literature class, will have to writ e essays and papers.  Usually you start with a first draft; you start writing it and then you go and you change it, that’s your second draft, and maybe even a third draft and  so forth until you get to the final draft.  So Catherine is asking Ralph if he ha s a draft of the guest list.  A “guest list” is a list of people that you are invit ing to a party.  I should mention that “draft” has some other meanings in English as well;  take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Catherine says, “We need to get the invitations out  next week,” we need to mail or send the invitations next week.  An “invitation”  is a card or a letter asking you to come to a party.  It could be for a wedding, it could be because someone is graduating, or just because you’re having a party –  you’re a party kind of person, you like to party.  Well, Catherine’s a real partie r.  Ralph says, “It’s not quite done yet (meaning the guest list is not finished yet).  I keep going back and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.”  “ To go back and forth” means to be unable to make a decision, or to think that some thing is right and then later to change your mind and think that it’s wrong; constan tly or continually going back and forth.  Is it right?  Is it wrong?  Should I in vite him?  Should I not invite him? That’s going back and forth.

Ralph is going back and forth about inviting a woma n named Lacy Say. Catherine says, “Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.”  A “ has-been” (been) is someone who was well known and popular a long time ago, but is not popular or is not important anymore.  It’s an insulting way of  referring to someone. Catherine says Lacy Say is a has-been, “She hasn’t been in a movie for years,” so she’s obviously an actress.  She says, “We only want people on the A-list at this party.”  The “A-list” would be the most popula r, the best-known performers, especially actors and singers.  The “B-list” would be actors and singers who aren’t very good, and so forth.

Ralph says, “What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence about him.”  “To be on the fence” means to be unable to make a decision be cause you see the good and the bad of each possibility.

So, Ralph is on the fence about Jess McGillan.  Cat herine says, “He’s definitely a D-lister.”  To be a “D-lister” is to be someone on the D-list, meaning an actor or singer who isn’t very well-known, who no one has ev er heard of – and who has ever heard of Jess McGillan anyway?  Catherine says , “This party is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing e lbows with VIPs.”  When you say something is “exclusive” you mean that it is av ailable for only a small group of people, people who are famous or rich or popular .  That would be something exclusive, only a small number of people can go or be a part of that event.

Catherine says, “we don’t want any D-listers rubbin g elbows with VIPs.”  “To rub (rub) elbows with (someone)” means to spend time at  a party or some event with someone who is famous, rich, and/or powerful.  I wa s at a Starbucks near one of the movie studios, and when you go there to drink c offee or tea you can sometimes rub elbows with famous actors and actress es, because they come in and get their coffee there.  When I go there, I can  rub elbows with famous actors. Unfortunately, I don’t recognize actors very well, so when they come in I don’t know who they are.  So, I’ve never really rubbed el bows, although once I did meet a actress who I did not recognize, but someone  else told me who she was. I think that was Neve Campbell, who was a televisio n star in the 1990s here in the United States.  Anyway, moving on.  Catherine d oesn’t want any of these less important rubbing elbows or talking and meetin g with VIPs.  A “VIP” is a very important person, someone with a lot of power or in fluence.

Ralph says, “I understand that, but what if we don’ t get enough A-listers to come?”  What if we can’t get enough people to our p arty?  Catherine says, “That will not happen.  This party has to be (must be) a success!”  Ralph says, “And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D-list celebrities?”  “To exclude” is related to the word “exclusive.”  “To exclude” means not to allow someone to come to your party or parti cipate in something.  It’s the opposite of “include,” which means to allow someone  to be part of your group or to do something.  Ralph is worried that they will n ot have enough people to come to the party if they exclude a lot of D-listers, the less famous actors and celebrities.  A “celebrity” is just anyone who’s ve ry famous, especially a singer or an actor or a podcaster.  Those three are usually w hat we talk about when we refer to celebrities!

So, Catherine says, “There will always be gatecrash ers.”  A “gatecrasher” is a person who goes to a party even though they were no t invited; they just go to the

party and show up.  They arrive, and even without a n invitation, they go into the party.  She says, “We can let in a few (a few gatec rashers; a few people who weren’t invited) to buff up the numbers, if push co mes to shove.”  “To buff (buff) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to improve something,  to make it slightly better; when we’re talking about numbers, to increase the n umbers of something. Catherine talks about buffing up the numbers, meani ng the number of people at the party.  They can do this if push comes to shove .  This is an old expression; “if push comes to shove” indicates that you will do som ething if the situation becomes very bad or difficult, and it becomes neces sary to do it even if you don’t want to.  You might say, “I’m going to buy somethin g at the store and I want to use my credit card.  But if I have a problem with m y credit card, if push comes to shove, I can also pay with cash.”  So Catherine is saying if push comes to shove they can buff up their numbers by letting in gatecr ashers.

Ralph says, “What happens to the exclusivity of the  party if that happens?”  Then the party won’t be exclusive anymore.  Catherine sa ys, “If that happens, this party has bombed.”  “To bomb,” as a verb, here mean s to fail very badly, to do a very poor job.  We especially use this when talking  about a performance; we might say, “The latest movie by Tom Cruise bombed,”  or “That new song by Jennifer Lopez bombed.”  It did not do very well; i t was not very popular. Catherine says if the party is not exclusive it wil l have bombed, and I don’t care if that happens – “I don’t care if we even let in podc asters!” meaning that would be the lowest, least popular person that we would want  to come to our party. Obviously they’re not talking about all podcasters.   I think Catherine here is referring to the less popular podcasters.  I think that’s what – I think that’s what the scriptwriter meant!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Catherine:  Do you have a draft of the guest list?  We need to get the invitations out next week.

Ralph:  It’s not quite done yet.  I keep going back  and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.

Catherine:  Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.  She hasn’ t been in a movie for years. We only want people on the A-list at this party.

Ralph:  What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence  about him.

Catherine:  He’s definitely a D-lister.  This party  is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing elbows with VIPs.

Ralph:  I understand that, but what if we don’t get  enough A-listers to come?

Catherine:  That will not happen.  This party has t o be a success!

Ralph:  And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D- list celebrities?

Catherine:  There will always be gatecrashers.  We can let in a few to buff up the numbers, if push comes to shove.

Ralph:  What happens to the exclusivity of the part y if that happens?

Catherine:  If that happens, this party has bombed and I don’t care if we even let in podcasters!

She’s no has-been; she’s an A-lister when it comes to scriptwriters here in Hollywood, that’s our own Dr. Lucy Tse I’m talking about.
