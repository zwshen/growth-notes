On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Maya and Jean-Paul about looking at a little baby. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maya: Isn’t this baby precious? She is just darling . Coo chi coo.

Jean-Paul: Why do women fawn over babies? One baby looks pretty much like any other.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you’d ever spent tim e with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her fac e is so expressive. Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?

Jean-Paul: I’m not wasting my time looking at a lit tle brat. Let’s go.

Maya: Wait, she’s smiling. Come look!

Jean-Paul: She has gas and needs to be burped. I do n’t even need to look at her to know that.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her fa ce. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest temperament .

Jean-Paul: Whatever.

Maya: Just come over here and look at her.

Jean-Paul: You’re not going to let me leave without  looking at her, are you?

 Maya: I think you’ll find her just as lovable and a dorable as I do.

Jean-Paul: All right, let’s take a look at this pre cious darling of an angel with an expressive face.

Maya: See what I mean?

Jean-Paul: She is, well, kind of cute and cuddly.

Maya: When you see her don’t you just want to . . .

Jean-Paul: Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.

[end of dialogue]

Maya begins our dialogue by saying, “Isn’t this bab y precious?” When we describe a baby as “precious” (precious), we mean it’s very beautiful. We could use that to describe a person such as a cute baby. We could also use that to describe a piece of art, for example, or something that is very beautiful or very beautifully made. Maya says, “She is just darling.”  “Darling” (darling) is another one of those words we would use to describe a beaut iful baby. Someone who is “darling” is someone who is very cute, very beautif ul.

Then Maya uses an expression that we sometimes use in talking to little babies. She says, “Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.” “Coo chi coo”  aren’t real words in English. They’re just words we use with a very high pitched sound – as I did in the example – that we use in talking to babies to get t heir attention, perhaps. I’m not sure where we came up with that phrase, “Coo chi co o,” but it is one that people use when communicating with a little baby.

Jean-Paul says, “Why do women fawn over babies?” “T o fawn (fawn) over” someone is to give someone a lot of attention, to g ive someone a lot of praise, to say nice things about a person. It could also, I su ppose, be used in talking about an object as well. We could talk about fawning over  a beautiful painting, saying how wonderful it is. Here, we’re talking about fawn ing over little babies. Jean- Paul says, “One baby looks pretty much like any oth er.” Jean-Paul is saying that most babies look alike, and so there’s no reason to  consider one baby cuter than another, I suppose.

Maya says, “You wouldn’t say that if you ever spent  time with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her fac e is so expressive.” A “doll”

(doll) is normally a little toy that young children , often young girls, play with that looks like a human being. When we use this in descr ibing a baby, we are saying that the baby is very cute. It’s another way of say ing “cute” or “beautiful,” just like we use the words “precious” and “darling.”

Maya says then that the face of the baby is “expres sive” (expressive). “To be expressive” means to show a lot of emotion in the w ay that you move your face or move your hands, or move your body – to express your emotions is to be expressive. Then Maya turns to the baby and says, “ Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?” Jean-Paul says, “I’m not wasting my time look ing at a little brat. Let’s go.” A “brat” (brat) is a child who behaves very badly.

We might also use the adjective “spoiled” (spoiled) . A “spoiled” child is a child who always gets what he wants, and if he doesn’t ge t what he wants, he cries or screams or does something to make his parents give him what he wants. It’s usually a bad idea, although there are many parents  who treat their children that way. My parents never treated me that way. When you  are the youngest of 11 children, you’re never going to get everything you want, although my older brothers and sisters say that because I was the you ngest, I did get everything I want, but believe me, that’s not true. Just ask me.

Jean-Paul says that he’s not going to waste his tim e looking at this little brat. Maya says, “Wait, she’s smiling. Come look,” meanin g come over and look at the baby. Jean-Paul, however, is still not convinced. H e says, “She has gas and needs to be burped. I don’t even need to look at he r to know that.” When we say a little baby has “gas” (gas), we mean they have ai r trapped inside their body that may make them feel uncomfortable.

What you do with little babies, I’m told, is pick t hem up and put them on your shoulder, and then you tap them lightly, perhaps, o n the back. This will help them “burp” (burp). “To burp” means to release that gas,  that air in your stomach, out through your mouth. “To be burped” would mean to ha ve the baby on your shoulder and helping it burp out that gas, get rid of that air inside his stomach. Jean-Paul says that he doesn’t even need to look at  her to know that. He knows that that’s what is happening here.

Maya says, “You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her face. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest tem perament.” “Angelic” (angelic) comes from the noun “angel” (angel). In t his case, it means a very beautiful, peaceful look. Maya says she has the swe etest “temperament” (temperament). Your “temperament” is how you normal ly react to something – your characteristics and moods. “To have a sweet te mperament” would be to be

happy, to always be peaceful, to be smiling. That’s  what this little baby has, according to Maya.

Jean-Paul says, “Whatever.” We use that expression very commonly now in English – informally – to mean, “Oh, okay, I’m not going to pay attention to that anymore,” or “I don’t think that’s very important,”  or “I am not interested in that.” There are lots of ways of using that expression, “W hatever.” The important part is the way you say it. You don’t say, “Whatever.” You say, “Whatever,” or “Whatever.” You have a certain intonation in your v oice that indicates that you’re bored, or you’re uninterested, or perhaps you don’t  want to talk about something anymore.

Maya says, “Just come over here and look at her.” J ean-Paul says, “You’re not going to let me leave without looking at her, are y ou?” Jean-Paul knows that they won’t be able to leave unless he goes over and look s at the baby. Maya says, “I think you’ll find her just as lovable and adorable as I do.” “To be lovable” (lovable) means to be easy to love, especially because someon e is good, kind, and beautiful. “Adorable” (adorable) is another adjecti ve for pretty, beautiful, attractive, lovely.

Jean-Paul says, “All right, let’s take a look at th is precious darling of an angel.” And here, he’s sort of making fun of Maya’s previou s descriptions, with an expressive face. Maya says, “See what I mean?” Jean -Paul, now that he’s looking at the baby, says, “She is, well, kind of c ute and cuddly.” “To be cute” (cute) is to be attractive, especially in a young, childlike way. “To be cuddly” (cuddly) is to have qualities that make you want to  pick up, in this case, the baby or child and put him in your arms because it feels good to hug him.

Then Maya says, “When you see her don’t you just wa nt to,” and Jean-Paul interrupts her with the same expression that Maya u sed at the beginning of the dialogue, that we use with young babies: “Coo chi c oo. Coo chi coo.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Our scriptwriter is always very expressive. That’s why she writes such wonderful scripts. Thank you, Dr. Lucy Tse.
