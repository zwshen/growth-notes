This episode is called “Asking for a First Date.”  It’s a conversation between Natalie and Sergio.  Sergio likes Natalie, and he’s going to do that most dangerous thing: ask her to go on a date with him.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Natalie:  Hello.  Sergio:  Hi, could I speak to Natalie?  Natalie:  This is she.    Sergio:  Oh hi, this is Sergio.  How are you?  Natalie:  Good.  How about you?  Sergio:  I’m great.  Uh, well, the reason I’m calling is I was wondering if you’d like to go out sometime?  Natalie:  You mean on a date?    Sergio:  Yeah, with me.    Natalie:  I’d love to.    Sergio:  Really?  I mean, that’s great.  I was thinking we could grab dinner on Friday and then see a movie.  How does that sound?
