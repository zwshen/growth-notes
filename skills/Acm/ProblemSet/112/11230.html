<h1>Problem A: Annoying painting tool</h1>
</center>
<p>
Maybe you wonder what an annoying painting tool is?
First of all, the painting tool we speak of supports only
black and white. Therefore, a picture consists of
a rectangular area of pixels, which are either black or
white.
Second, there is only one operation how to
change the colour of pixels:
</p>
<p>
Select a rectangular area of <strong>r</strong> rows and
<strong>c</strong> columns of pixels, which is completely
inside the picture. As a result of the operation, each
pixel inside the selected rectangle changes its colour
(from black to white, or from white to black).
</p>
<p>Initially, all pixels are white. To create a picture,
the operation described above can be applied several
times. Can you paint a certain picture which you have in
mind?</p>

<h4>Input Specification</h4>
<p>
The input contains several test cases.
Each test case starts with one line containing four integers
<strong>n</strong>, <strong>m</strong>, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>c</strong>.
(<i>1 &le; r &le; n &le; 100, 1 &le; c &le; m &le; 100</i>),
The following <strong>n</strong> lines each describe one row of pixels 
of the painting you want to create. The <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong>
line consists of <strong>m</strong> characters describing the desired
pixel values of the <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> row in the finished
painting ('0' indicates white, '1' indicates black).
</p>
<p>
The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros.
</p>
<h4>Output Specification</h4>
<p>
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed
to create the painting, or -1 if it is impossible.
