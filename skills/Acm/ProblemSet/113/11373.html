<P><font size=6>T</font>oday is Ray's birthday. Three of his friends, Jay, Kay and May, comes to his birthday party.

<P>Ray has a very big birthday cake. The cake is basically a circular cylinder with radius <b><i>R</i></b> and height <b><i>h</i></b>.
   Ray makes two vertical cuts and divides the cake into four pieces. Ray gets the largest piece of cake, and May, who is currently on
   diet, takes the smallest piece.

<P align=center><img src="p11373a.png">

<P><b>Write a program</b> to compute the volumes of the two pieces of cake.

<P><H2><A name=SECTION00001000000000000000><FONT color=#5000BF>Input</FONT></A></H2>

<p>Input contains several test cases. The first line of each case gives <b><i>R</i></b> and <b><i>h</i></b>,
   and each of the next two lines specifies a cut performed.

<P>Consider the top view of the cake. We may look at it as a circle of radius <b><i>R</i></b>, centred at the origin <b>(0, 0)</b>. A cut is specified by two points (not necessarily on the boundary of the cake) on a straight line. The two cuts may or may not pass through the center, but they always produce exactly 4 pieces.

<P>All input numbers are integers whose absolute values do not exceed <b>100</b>. All four pieces of cake have positive volumes.

<P><H2><A name=SECTION00001000000000000000><FONT color=#5000BF>Output</FONT></A></H2>

<p>For each test case, output a line containing the volume of the Ray's piece of cake followed by that of May's piece, correct to 2 decimal places.
