This episode is called “Making Repairs on the Outsi de of a House.”  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Maggie:  Watch out!  Are you okay?   

Conrad:  I’m fine, but I almost tripped over that c rack in the driveway.  We’ve got to get that fixed. 

Maggie:  I know it’s a hazard, but first things fir st.  We should fix those broken front steps, don’t you think? 

Conrad:  I see what you mean. 

Maggie:  And we have to repair that part of the fen ce that’s falling down.  See?  If it leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gat e.   

Conrad:  Oh, I didn’t realize the fence was falling  down.  Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those things first. 

Maggie:  And the porch light is out.  I’m not sure if we just need to replace the bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue.   

Conrad:  I didn’t realize the outside of our house was in such disrepair.  I’ve been traveling too much for work.   

Maggie:  I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs,  too.   

Conrad:  All right, I know what we’ll be doing this  weekend – all weekend!  

 [end of dialogue] 

Maggie begins by saying to Conrad, “Watch out!”  “W atch out” means be careful. It’s a phrase we use to warn someone that something  bad is going to happen very soon, usually something that may hurt them phy sically.  Maggie says, “Are you okay?”  Conrad says, “I’m fine, but I almost tr ipped over that crack in the driveway.”  “To trip (trip) over (something)” means  to hit your foot on something and then to fall.  In our story – our dialogue, Con rad trips over a crack that is in the driveway.  The “driveway” is an area where you can drive your car.  When you pull your car off of the street – when you driv e it off of the street next to your house or your apartment building, the place between  the street and the garage where you drive your car, that’s called the “drivew ay” (one word).  A “crack” is when you have an opening in either a wall or it cou ld be, in this case, the driveway.  The driveway is made of a very hard mate rial called “concrete” typically, and sometimes there are holes – there ar e lines that form in the concrete, and this causes the driveway to have an u neven spot, a spot where suddenly it’s a little higher, a little taller than  what comes before it.  And if you are walking along, and you don’t see it, you could trip  over it.  It’s sort of like if there were a piece of wood lying on the ground, and you d idn’t see it.  Your foot would hit it and you might fall. 

Conrad says that he has to get this crack fixed.  “ To fix” means to repair, to get it so that it is normal again.  Maggie said, “I know i t’s a hazard, but first things first.” A “hazard” (hazard) is something that could cause d amage or injury, something that could hurt you.  The adjective “hazardous” is used to describe things – liquids, chemicals, materials – that can hurt you.  A “hazard,” as a noun, is that thing, that thing that could hurt you.  Maggie says , “first things first,” however. The expression “first things first” is used to mean  that you need to do the most important things first.  You have lots of things to  do today, but you have to put them in a certain priority.  It’s become popular in  the last few decades to say “prioritize,” to make a verb out of “priority.”  Do n’t really love that; prefer, myself, just to say “to make it a priority.”  That’s what M aggie says: we need to do first things first, the most important things first.  She  thinks that is to fix those broken front steps.  The “front steps” (steps) are the sta irs that go from the outside of the house to the inside of the house; it’s what allows you to go into a house if the door is higher up than the ground outside.  We call  these “steps” when they’re outside of the house; inside of the house we would call them “stairs.”  However, that’s not always the case.  Sometimes people will talk about the steps as being the individual levels of the stairs.  So, you could  talk about the second step of the stairs.  But when someone says “front steps,” they’ re always referring to the  

stairs or steps that are on the outside of the hous e that allow you to come into the house. 

Conrad says, “I see what you mean.”  He agrees with  Maggie.  Maggie then says, “And we have to repair that part of the fence  that’s falling down.”  A “fence” (fence) is like a wall that you have around your ho use.  Normally it’s made of wood or metal, and it keeps people from coming into  your house, or it may keep animals or children from going outside of your prop erty.  You often have a fence separating two different properties – two different  houses here in the United States.  I have a fence in the back of my house and  on both sides of my house, separating me from the houses around me. 

Well, Maggie thinks that the fence needs to be fixe d because it’s falling down, meaning parts of it are broken, or it is going to h it the ground.  It’s going to instead of be vertical, up and down, it’s going to be lying down on the ground and then, of course, it wouldn’t be a fence anymore.  T hat’s really what Maggie means.  She says, “If the fence leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gate.”  “To lean” (lean) can mean to rest yourself against something else.  If you are standing up and you are tired, you may lean aga inst the wall.  Your body will touch the wall sort of as if you were resting.  For  a fence to lean, however, we mean that is no longer perfectly vertical; it is st arting to fall down towards the ground.   

Maggie says that if the fence leans any more than i t is now, “we won’t be able to open the gate.”  The “gate” is a door in the fence that allows you to go in and out of the area that the fence is protecting.  So it’s a way to go through the fence; it’s a door in the fence.  Conrad says, “Oh, I didn’t re alize the fence was falling down. Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those thi ngs first.”  Conrad is the perfect husband, you see here, he’s agreeing to everything his wife is telling him!   

Maggie says, because now she sees that Conrad is ag reeing with her, “And the porch light is out.”  The “porch” is an area in fro nt of your house that’s part of the house, but usually is not an area that has windows.   That’s not always true, either.  In my house – my old house where I lived i n Minnesota we had a porch, but it was a porch that had windows so that you cou ld sit outside there.  Usually a porch isn’t heated in the wintertime, it’s not part  of the regular house, and that’s probably the only difference that I can think of in  terms of the porch that I grew up with.  Many people have outdoor porches that are ju st areas that are covered, they have sort of a little roof over them, in front  of the house where they can sit and watch the people walk by I guess.   

There’s a light in the porch of Conrad and Maggie’s  house that is out.  When we say it’s “out,” we mean it’s broken; in this case, the light no longer works.  Usually “out” is used to describe a light that no longer wo rks, no longer “comes on” we would say, or “turns on.”  Maggie says, “I’m not su re if we just need to replace (or put in a new) bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue. ”  “Bulb” (bulb) is a light bulb, that’s the thing that produces the light.  “Electrical” re fers to “electricity,” which is the power that turns, in this case, the light bulb on.  If it’s an electrical issue, it may be something with the wires, for example.  Those ar e the long, thin pieces of metal that bring power to the light bulb, or to any  other electrical device. 

Conrad says, “I didn’t realize the outside of our h ouse was in such disrepair.” “Disrepair” means broken, not working correctly.  H e says, “I’ve been traveling too much for work,” meaning I have been traveling f or my job, and so I haven’t seen all of these problems.  Maggie says, “I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs, too.”  “To put off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to delay doing something, especially something that should be done  now.  “I’m going to put off that decision.”  I’m not going to decide today, I’m  going to do it next week.  So, “to put off” means to delay.  Conrad says, “All rig ht, I know what we’ll be doing this weekend – all weekend!” meaning it’s going to take all of our days this weekend, this Saturday and Sunday, to finish repair ing all of these problems on the outside of the house. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
