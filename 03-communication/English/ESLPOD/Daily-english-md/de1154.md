In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mary and Will about going to historical sites. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Mary: I think we should call it a day. 

Will: I think we still have time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation  and restoration.  

Mary: It’s not another old castle, is it? 

Will: It’s not any old castle. This one dates back to the 1300s. If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for the last guided tour with a docent w ho’s knowledgeable. And I hope we have time to visit the archives, too. 

Mary: Oh no, not the archives.  

Will: I wonder if they’re doing reenactments to com memorate any major historical events during our time here?  

Mary: If we visit this castle today, we’re not comi ng back. There is a lot to see in this city other than old castles and monuments. 

Will: Like what? 

Mary: Like art museums and stores. It would also be  nice to relax a little while on vacation. 

Will: But what’s art and shopping when you’re in on e of the most ancient cities in the world? And there’s no time to relax. We only ha ve four days here. We have to make the most of it. Hey, where are you going? 

Mary: I think it’s time to split up. You go see you r castle and I’ll explore on my own.  

Will: But you won’t get the full benefits of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world. 

Mary: I think I’ll survive. 

[end of dialogue] 

Mary begins by saying to Will, “I think we should c all it a day.” The expression “to call it a day” means to stop doing something for th at day, possibly to start again tomorrow. If you’re working late at your office, so meone may say, “Well, it’s time to go home. Let’s call it a day,” meaning let’s say  this is the end. We’re not going to continue working today.  

Mary and Will aren’t working, however. They’re out visiting important historic sites. A “site” (site) is a place of interest. A “h istoric (historic) site” is a site that is of importance, of historical importance.  

There is a difference between “historic” and “histo rical” (historical). “Historical” is anything from the past. “Historic” is an adjective that describes something that’s very important, that is important in history. Somet hing could be both historic and historical. In fact, most sites, most places that y ou visit that are considered historic are almost by definition historical as wel l. They’re old places.  

So, for example, if you go to a famous building tha t was built many years ago, you could call that a “historic site.” You could al so call it a “historical site.” However, many cities have “historical places” – pla ces that are old but aren’t important, that aren’t significant in history, and so they’re not historic sites. It’s a little confusing even to native speakers.  

Back to our story, Will says, “I think we still hav e time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation and restoration.” “Preservation” (preservation) is when  you try to keep something in  

good condition, something that is old and valuable.  “Restoration” (restoration) is when you take something that has been damaged, that  needs to be fixed, and make it better.  

“Preservation” means to keep something in its curre nt condition. “Restoration” means to fix something and make it better. Many old  buildings first need to be “restored” and then “preserved.” Mary says, “It’s n ot another old castle, is it?” A “castle” (castle) is a large building, usually made  of stone, where kings and queens live, or used to live. Many countries, espec ially in Europe, have castles where kings and queens live or used to live many ye ars ago.  

It doesn’t sound like Mary wants to go to another c astle. Will says, “It’s not any old castle,” meaning it is a castle but it’s a spec ial one. “This one,” he says, “dates back to the 1300s.” “To date back to” means to have its origins or beginnings in a certain year or period – to be of a  certain age. This castle was built, then, in the 1300s, presumably the 1300s A.D ., or roughly 700, 800 years ago.  

Will says, “If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for th e last guided tour with a docent who’s knowledgeable.” A “guided tour” is a tour tha t you take of a place or a building led by what we would call a “tour guide,” a person who knows about that place. A “docent” (docent) is a person who works us ually in a museum who knows a lot about the things in that museum. Someti mes there are docents who lead tours, who guide people through a museum on a guided tour, explaining what everything means.  

Will says, “I hope we have time to visit the archiv es, too.” “Archives” (archives) usually are large collections of important document s and sometimes small objects. Here in the United States, we have somethi ng called the “National Archives.” It’s a place in Washington D.C., a build ing that has many old important documents and papers. Mary, however, clearly doesn’ t want to go to see the archives. She says, “Oh no, not the archives.” She’ s saying she doesn’t want to go there.  

Will says, “I wonder if they’re doing reenactments to commemorate any major historical events during our time here.” A “reenact ment” (reenactment) is a presentation in which people act out something that  happened long ago. Usually this is some historical event that you want to teac h other people about or you want to understand more yourself. You’ll dress up p erhaps in the clothing that people might have worn many years ago and reenact c ertain famous events. This is quite popular in certain areas.  

I’m not really someone who loves the whole idea of reenactments, but people do like them. They can certainly teach us about the wa y things were perhaps many years ago. People like to reenact old battles. Peop le like to reenact other famous historical events. It’s sort of like putting on a p lay, but you are acting out or trying to recreate the actions of people many years ago.  

“To commemorate” (commemorate) means to remember an d honor someone or something in a special way. Reenactments can commem orate some important events, some historical events. Once again we see t hat word “historical,” meaning old. The word “major” here means very impor tant. Will, then, is wondering if the people at this particular castle w ill be doing any reenactments to commemorate some major historical event while Mary and Will are visiting.  

Mary says, “If we visit this castle today, we’re no t coming back. There’s a lot to see in this city other than old castles and monumen ts.” Mary is saying that if they go to this castle today, they are not going to retu rn later in their trip because she wants to see other things. She thinks there is more  to see than “castles and monuments” (monuments).  

A “monument” is some object that was built to remem ber and honor important people or events. If you go to the capital of the U nited States – Washington, D.C. – you will see many monuments to important people a nd to important events. Monuments are sometimes built to honor people who h ave died in a war, for example, or to remember certain important events in  a country’s history. 

Will says, “Like what?” He’s asking Mary, “What oth er important things are there to see in this city other than castles and monument s?” Mary says, “Like” – or “such as” – “art museums and stores.” “Art museums”  (museums) are places where you of course can see famous pieces of art – paintings and sculptures and that sort of thing. Mary says, “It would also be ni ce to relax a little while on vacation.” Many people go on vacation to see things , but they perhaps don’t relax very much. They don’t just sit and read or talk.  

Will says, “But what’s art and shopping when you’re  in one of the most ancient cities in the world?” “Ancient” (ancient) means ver y old. Will is saying that museums and shopping are not very important compare d to the other historical things that you can see in this city. He continues,  “And there’s no time to relax. We only have four days here. We have to make the mo st of it.” “To make the most of” something means to take full advantage of it, to use something the most you can.  

Will says, “Hey, where are you going?” Mary says, “ I think it’s time to split up.” “To split (split) up” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to separate – for two people to stop doing something together. Normally w hen we use the verb “to split up” talking about a married couple, we’re talking a bout two people who are no longer going to be together in their marriage – or you could talk about a boyfriend and a girlfriend splitting up.  

However, we can also use this when we are traveling , or we are going to a place and each person wants to go to a different part of that place. We could split up. One of us could go shopping and another could go to  monuments, and then we could meet back again later at our hotel. That’s th e kind of “splitting up” Mary is talking about, I think. Mary says, “You go see your  castle and I’ll explore on my own.” “To explore” (explore) means to move around a  place without any clear plan, just to see what you will discover, what you will find new.  

Will says, “But you won’t be getting the full benef its of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world.” Mary says, “I think I ’ll survive.” She’s not really concerned about it. She says, “I think I’ll survive ,” meaning it’s okay, it’s not that important to me – I’m going to be okay even if I do n’t visit all of the things that you want to visit. Now see, I am a lot like Will. I  like to go and see everything when I go on a vacation, and my wife is a little bi t more like Mary. She’d rather relax more.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
