<h2><font color="#0070E8">Context</font></h2>

<p>The company Assistance for Critical Moments (ACM) is helping other companies to
overcome the current economical crisis. As experts in computing machinery, their job is to
calculate the cost/benefit balance of the other companies. They receive two numbers,
indicating the total amount of benefits and costs, and they have to compute the final
balance.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Problem</font></h2>

<p>You have to solve the complex business problem of computing balances. You are given two
positive integer numbers, corresponding to the benefits and the costs. You have to obtain
the total balance, i.e., the difference between benefits and costs.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Input</font></h2>

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer indicating the number of test cases.</p>

<p>For each test case, there is a line with two positive integer numbers, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>,
corresponding to the benefits and the costs, respectively. Both numbers are between 0 and
a googol (10<sup>100</sup>) to the power of a hundred.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Output</font></h2>

<p>For each test case, the output should consist of a line indicating the balance: <em>A</em>-<em>B</em>.</p>
