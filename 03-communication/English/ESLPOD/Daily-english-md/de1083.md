On this episode, we’ll listen to a dialogue between  Josh and Kayla about different kinds of pants – you know, the things you wear on y our legs. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Josh: We are going to get you out of those baggy sw eatpants and into some pants that fit.

Kayla: I don’t like pants that are too formfitting.

Josh: I’m not suggesting you buy skintight leggings , but some nice slacks would be slimming.

Kayla: I like pants with an elastic waistband. They ’re more comfortable.

Josh: Just try these khaki chinos. They’re not too tight, they’re made of a breathable fabric, and they’re comfortable.

Kayla: I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jeans.

Josh: You can’t wear jeans to your new job.

Kayla: I know, but these pants are too constricting . Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants?

Josh: That is the best example of an oxymoron I’ve ever heard.

Josh begins our dialogue by saying to Kayla, “We ar e going to get you out of those baggy sweatpants and into some pants that fit .” “To get someone out of” something is to have them remove the clothing that they are wearing, and that’s what Josh is talking about when it comes to Kayla.

Kayla is wearing some “baggy sweatpants.” “Sweatpan ts” (sweatpants) are very comfortable, loose pants that are typically made wi th a soft material, a soft fabric – something like cotton. Sweatpants are often used for people who are exercising. If they don’t want to wear shorts, they  wear sweatpants. The verb “to sweat” (sweat) refers to water coming out of your b ody when you are exercising or when you get hot. A lot of people wear sweatpant s at home because they’re comfortable, and if you are in a cold climate, an a rea where the weather is somewhat cold, they are also a little warmer.

“Baggy” is an adjective we use when talking about c lothing to refer to clothing that is too big for someone, that is very large for  someone. I say “too big” – that’s probably not quite the way to describe it. It’s a p iece of clothing that is very large, that is much larger than your body, much larger tha n you would normally wear. If your pants are baggy, your pants are too big for yo u. There’s a lot of room in between your body and the material of the pants.

Josh is telling Kayla that she is going to have to take off her baggy sweatpants and get “into some pants that fit” (fit). The verb “to fit” here means it’s the proper size or the appropriate size for someone. If you sa y a certain shirt “fits” you, you mean the shirt is not too big – it’s not too baggy – and it’s not too small. We would say it’s “not too tight” (tight).

Kayla says, “I don’t like pants that are too formfi tting.” A piece of clothing that is “formfitting” is one that is tight up against your body. It’s not too small, but it touches your skin, typically. If you wear it, someo ne can see your form underneath the clothing. They can see the shape of your body very clearly. Kayla says she does not like “pants that are too formfitt ing.”

Josh says, “I’m not suggesting you buy skintight le ggings, but some nice slacks would be slimming.” Something that is “skintight” i s something that is similar to formfitting, but it’s even tighter. It’s very tight  against your skin. “Leggings” (leggings) are tight pants that end at the ankles, the part that connects your leg to your foot. They are often worn underneath a skirt o r a dress. They are used when the weather is cold outside, usually by women. The term “slacks” (slacks) refers to pants that are considered more formal, that you would wear to work or to some sort of professional event.

Josh is saying that he doesn’t want Kayla to buy sk intight leggings, but rather some nice slacks – a nice pair of pants that he say s would be “slimming” (slimming). Something that is “slimming” is somethi ng that makes you appear thinner than you actually are, that makes you appea r to weigh less than you actually do. The color black is often used to this effect, to have a slimming effect, so that you don’t seem quite as fat as you really a re.

Kayla says, “I like pants with an elastic waistband . They’re more comfortable.” The “waistband” (waistband) refers to the top part of a pair of pants, the part that goes around your waist. What is your “waist” (waist )? It’s the part of your body where your legs are connected to the main or torso part of your body. You can think of it as an imaginary line that goes around t he middle of your body.

Usually, when you put on a pair of pants, you pull the pants up and the pants stop right around your waist. In fact, when you buy  a pair of pants, typically the size is given in inches or centimeters, including t he size of the waist, because of course you need a pair of pants that are not too bi g and not too small for your particular body. Pants sizes are also usually given  in terms of the length of the individual “pant legs,” we would call them.

Kayla is talking about a waistband that is “elastic ” (elastic). If a fabric or a material is “elastic,” it stretches. It is “expanda ble,” we could also say. So, for example, if you have a pair of sweatpants on, usual ly the sweatpants will have an elastic band on the top so that if you are a little  skinnier or a little fatter, the pants will still fit you. This is in comparison to a pair  of slacks, a more formal pair of pants, where the waistband doesn’t stretch. It does n’t get bigger or smaller depending on your body.

Josh gives Kayla some khaki chinos to try. “Chinos”  (chinos) are pants that are not formal, but not informal. They’re sort of in be tween. Usually they have a zipper and a button on the front of them. “Khaki (k haki) chinos” are usually a light brown or tan colored pair of pants. “Khakis” became  very popular a few years ago. They’re not really formal pants. You wouldn’t wear them to a wedding or funeral probably, but they’re also not too informal , either. They’re not like a pair of sweatpants, say.

Josh says the khaki chinos are not too tight and th ey’re made of a “breathable fabric.” “Fabric” (fabric) refers to the material t hat clothing is made of. If the fabric is “breathable” (breathable), it is fabric that all ows air to pass through easily. “Cotton,” for example, is considered a breathable f abric.

Kayla says, “I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jea ns.” “Jeans” (jeans) are pants usually made from a material called “denim” (denim) , and they’re typically blue, although nowadays you can get jeans in other colors  as well. If the clothing is “broken-in” (broken-in), it has already been worn o r washed many times so that it’s more comfortable, or at least that’s one reaso n why people would buy jeans that are broken-in. They’re usually softer, because  denim can sometimes be a little uncomfortable when it is new, when it hasn’t  been worn or washed before.

We use the phrasal verb “to break in” also when we’ re talking about a pair of shoes. If someone says, “I need to break in this pa ir of shoes,” he means that he needs to wear the shoes in order to make them softe r and more comfortable. Shoes, when you first buy them, especially formal s hoes – shoes that you would wear for a formal occasion – are sometimes hard and  a little uncomfortable when you first start wearing them. So, we use the expres sion “to break-in” to refer to the process of making the shoe more comfortable by wearing it, usually a little bit every day until the shoes are broken-in.

Josh says, “You can’t wear jeans to your new job.” Jeans are considered informal pants, not the kind of thing you would wear to a jo b – not to any sort of formal event, either. Kayla says, “I know, but these pants  are too constricting.” Kayla has put on another pair of pants that Josh has reco mmended and is complaining that they’re too constricting. If pants are “constr icting” (constricting), they’re too tight, and that’s the problem Kayla is having.

She says, “Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants ?” If clothing is “dressy” (dressy), it’s something that can be used in a form al situation or for a formal occasion. When we talk about our “dress clothes,” w e’re talking about clothes that would be used for a formal event. If you’re go ing to a wedding, you would want to wear your dress clothes. You would want you r clothes to be “dressy.”

Kayla’s asking if she can buy a pair of “dressy swe atpants.” And Josh says no, that is an “example of an oxymoron.” The term “oxym oron” (oxymoron) is used to describe two words that are put together that have the opposite meaning. If someone were to say, for example, “He’s a short gia nt.” Well, a “giant” (giant) is a very tall person or creature. So, you can’t have a “short giant.” That’s an oxymoron. The two words don’t go together. They hav e opposite meanings.

Sometimes people use this as a way of making a joke , using certain adjectives or adverbs next to nouns or verbs or other adjectives that don’t go together or that are opposite. If you said something was “beautifull y ugly,” that would be an example of an oxymoron because “beautiful” and “ugl y” are opposites. Kayla wants to buy some sweatpants that are dressy, and t hat’s not possible because

sweatpants are “by definition,” we would say, by th eir very nature, not formal, not dressy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
