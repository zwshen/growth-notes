<p>Wolfgang Puck's rival, Emeril Lagasse ("BAM!"), recently set the world
culinary record in the category of smallest soufflé measuring in at a mere 2 cm!
Wolfgang, not to be outdone, decided that he would set a culinary record of his
own: the most symmetric marble cake in the world. This is clearly not an easy
feat!</p>

<p>As we all know from Wolfgang's bestselling biography, he is a very
superstitious chef. In his attempts to create the symmetric cake, he has vowed
to remove the cake from the oven only at a palindromic time, i.e., a time that
reads the same when read from left-to-right as right-to-left. Not including the
current time, when is the next opportunity for Wolfgang to remove his cake?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input you are given <em>n</em>, the number of attempts
Wolfgang makes to make his symmetric cake. The following <em>n</em> lines contain
a string formatted as "HH:MM" indicating the current time on a twenty-four hour
clock. (So 0 &le; HH &le; 23 and 0 &le; MM &le; 59 and "00:00" follows "23:59")</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each attempt, output a string indicating the next palindromic time
(not including the current time) on a single line formatted as "hh:mm".
When determining if HH:MM is palindromic, ignore all leading zeroes in HH.
If HH is zero then ignore all leading zeroes in MM.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
3
00:00
23:30
14:59
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
00:01
23:32
15:51
</pre>
