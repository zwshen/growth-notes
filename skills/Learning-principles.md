## 2020
* 12/07 從evernote上把資料搬到github上，Life principel 第一大條全文就405句，但我大概只有背到1.3也就28+5+30 = 73句而已。相比核聚訂21天23篇文章共211句，我連34%的目標都比不上。
* 12/07 打算改成來背誦和精讀life principels 的第2大條“5-Step Process"，想說這5步似乎滿貼近生活，會比較方便從生活中找案例來驗證原則內容。

## 2018

* 10/09 每個句子都會有個主要的句型、結構、或單詞，有助於聯想出整個句子，如reconcile, stretching for, exhilarating 等...有點像是chunk的線頭。
* 10/11 背熟句子後，腦子就有餘力去思考連音怎麼發，聽audio時也比較能注意到連音。
* 10/15 再默背時，前六句基本上很熟，沒什麼思考就能寫下來，但是後面的8-12句就得靠非常用力的回想，很容易漏掉一些介系詞。13-14句得要再花時間背背看。
* 10/16 背誦時，不知道是不是自已牙齒問題 (牽拖？) 總覺得發音很怪，是說，我沒有逼自已像Ray Dalio那樣發出相同的發音，我這個背誦做得不到位。但是一天一些進步是可以的，我不應該給自已太大壓力和焦慮。
* 10/19 估算背完1.1 ~ 1.10共405，必須要能每天背7句，一週能背50句，才能在12/14背完。
* 10/22 - 六、日都沒背誦的進度，今天一口氣從頭默背，想不到可以大都可以很熟的寫出來，約每句子1分鐘。但是到1.1 後就不行了，下的功夫不而已。整體進度還是落後。
* 10/24 每天大概只有花30分鐘在默寫舊句子和背新的句子，還沒有到1天背10句的程度。
* 10/25 1.1.a 未段的 work hard 一句的介系詞很難背...

    f. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.

    g. Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence.
    [bɪˋkɔz]   [ˋdɪfə͵kəlt]  [si] [wʌnˋsɛlf] [əbˋdʒɛktɪvlɪ] [ju] [nid]  [rɪˋlaɪ]  [ðə] [ˋɪn͵pʊt]   [ænd] [ðə] [hol] [ˋbɑdɪ]  [ˋɛvədəns]
