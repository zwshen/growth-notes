This episode has a dialogue between Kam and Gina us ing business vocabulary related to advertising.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kam:  Okay, the purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advertising campaign.  Gina, take it away.

Gina:  Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk today about outdoor advertising.  I know that it’s a new area for us and it hasn’t been on o ur radar in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.

Kam:  Can we talk specifics?

Gina:  Sure.  There are several types of outdoor ad vertising.  One is the billboard, both the traditional kind and the digita l ones.  Advertising on ones in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.  To get even more exposure all over town, we can use mobile advertising.

Kam:  You mean advertise on buses?

Gina:  Yes, more and more, products are being adver tised on buses and cars. These wraps can also be put on the side of building s and other structures.  There really are a lot of outdoor advertising options, fr om bench ads to skywriting.

Kam:  That’s all very interesting, but which of the se methods do you recommend?

Gina:  I think we should use all of them – blanket the city with our new ads.

Kam:  All of them?

Gina:  Yes, all of them.  You know what they say: “ Go big or go home.”

Kam begins our dialogue by saying to Gina, “Okay, t he purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advert ising campaign.”  “To advertise” means to let other people know about wha t you are selling: your product or service.  An “advertising campaign” is a  coordinated effort, a project that includes all the different parts of advertisin g.  There may be advertising on the Internet; it may include advertising on televis ion.  Together, these things are called an “advertising campaign.”  Kam says to Gina , “Gina, take it away.”  The expression “take it away” is used in an informal me eting or an informal situation to show that you are done talking and you are ready  for someone else to begin their presentation or to begin leading the meeting.

Kam is done talking, so he wants Gina to start talk ing.  He says, “Gina, take it away.”  Gina says, “Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk  today about outdoor advertising.”  “Outdoor” (outdoor – one word) refer s to what is not inside a building or a house; that is, if you’re not in a bu ilding or in a house, then you are outdoors – you are outside of a house or building.  “Outdoor advertising” would include things that you would see while driving or walking outside of your house or building.  Gina says, “I know that it’s a new ar ea for us (outdoor advertising is a new area for them) and it hasn’t been on our rada r in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.”  The expression “t o be on your radar” or “to be on our radar” (radar) is used to show that you are aware of something; you are considering something; you are thinking about somet hing.  “Radar,” as you probably know, is the system used to determine, for  example, where planes are in the sky.  It allows you to know where objects are that you cannot see.  Gina says that her company has not used outdoor advertis ing in the past, but she thinks that it will be successful for their new cam paign.

Kam then interrupts Gina and says, “Can we talk spe cifics?”  There’s actually two things here: the first is the expression “can we ta lk (blank).”  In this case, it’s specifics, but you could say, “Can we talk vacation  now?”  “Can we talk advertising?”  This is a somewhat informal abbrevia ted way of saying can we talk about something.  Now, Kam says, “Can we talk speci fics?” meaning can you tell us the specific things about this advertising.  “Sp ecific” is the opposite of “general,” you want to know what is the case for th is particular campaign.

Gina says, “Sure.  There are several types of outdo or advertising.  One is the billboard (billboard).”  A “billboard” is a large s ign used to advertise.  Typically, it’s up high in the air and you can see it when you are driving down the street.  That’s a “billboard.”  Gina says that there are both tradi tional billboards and digital ones. A “traditional billboard” has the same image – you see the same thing every time you go by it.  It’s often made with large pieces of  paper.  A “digital billboard” is a new thing, where it’s actually a big video screen l ike a big television, and the images change as the day goes on.  In fact, they of ten change every 5 or 10 seconds.  We have these digital billboards now here  in Los Angeles, including one just about four or five blocks from where I liv e.  Gina says, “Advertising on ones (meaning on billboards) in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.” A “high-traffic area” is a place where there are a lot of people or there are a lot of cars going by; many people will see the sign.  Time s Square in New York is a high-traffic area; there are always people there in  the center of the city, in Manhattan.  Well, a high-traffic area would be any area that you had a lot of people either walking or driving by.  If you put ad vertisements, in this case a billboard, in a high-traffic area you will get lots  of exposure.  “Exposure” just means you will be seen or heard by many people, in this case seen.

Gina says, “To get even more exposure all over town  (meaning in every part of the city), we can use mobile advertising.”  Somethi ng that is “mobile” moves around; it doesn’t stay in one place.  Kam asks, “You mean advertising on buses?”  Notice the informal way he asks: “You mean  advertise on buses,” instead of “Do you mean advertise (or advertising) on buses?”  Gina says, “Yes, more and more, products (things that people sell) a re being advertised on buses and cars (obviously on the side of the bus or the b ack of the bus).  These wraps can also be put on the side of buildings and other structures.”  A “wrap” (wrap) is a large piece of plastic or other material that com pletely covers something else. It can be used as a form of advertising for example  on a bus.  Sometimes here in the U.S. when you see a bus there isn’t just one si gn on one side of the bus, but the entire bus is wrapped – is enclosed, if you wil l – by this plastic that is advertising for whatever the company is advertising .  That’s a “wrap.”  You can also put these on the sides of buildings and struct ures.  Sometimes buildings have advertisements that go on the side of the buil ding or around the building. “Structures” is just something that has been built:  a building, a bridge, a monument.  All of these are structures, things that  we build.

Gina says, “There really are a lot of other outdoor  advertising options (or possibilities), from bench ads to skywriting.”  A “ bench (bench) ad” is a bench advertisement; “ad” is short for “advertisement.”  It is when you have a long chair, basically, for people to sit on so you can have two  or three people sitting, and you put these on the street where the bus stops.  S o, when you are waiting for

the bus you can sit down on this thing that, as I s ay, looks like a long chair; we call it a “bench.”  You can put advertising on the benches.  Here in Los Angeles, it’s very common for people who sell and buy houses  – real estate agents we would call them – to advertise on bench ads.  Anoth er kind outdoor advertising is “skywriting.”  The “sky” is what’s above you, up in  the air; it’s usually blue in most places.  Today here in Los Angeles it’s a little gr ay because we have clouds, at least this morning.  Well, “skywriting” when a plan e goes up in the air – a small plane typically – and it writes something in the ai r; it leaves a white vapor or smoke behind it that you can look up and see.  Ofte n people will, for example, write messages to their loved ones.  “Will you marr y me?” for example would be a piece of skywriting – an expensive marriage propo sal, to be sure!

Kam says, “That’s all very interesting, but which of these methods do you recommend?”  Gina says, “I think we should use all of them (all of the kinds of advertising she has talked about).”  She says, “bla nket the city with our new ads.” “To blanket” (blanket) as a verb means to cover som ething entirely.  She’s saying that we should put advertising in all the different  places in the city: billboards, bench ads, skywriting, mobile advertising, wraps, a nd so forth.  “ Blanket” has a couple of different meanings however; take a look a t our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Kam is a little surprise, he says, “All of them?”  Gina says, “Yes, all of them.  You know what they say: ‘Go big or go home.’”  “To go b ig” means to do something with the most energy, with the maximum amount of ef fort, something that is going to be the most you could do.  If you were going to propose to your girlfriend, and you wanted to go big, you could hire a plane – you could pay to have a message written in the sky – skywriting.  Or, you could…I d on’t know…fly to the moon and send a message from the moon back to your girlfrien d.  That might work; you should try that!  That would definitely be going bi g!  Well, the expression is “go big or go home,” meaning either do something 100 pe rcent or don’t do anything, forget about it.  Gina thinks the company should go  big or not do anything at all. Of course, it isn’t Gina’s money that’s being spent  here; it’s the companies!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
