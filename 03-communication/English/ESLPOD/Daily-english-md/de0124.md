# Asking for Clarification in a Business Meeting.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 124: Asking for Clarification in a Business Meeting.

Hello, and welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 124. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, and as always, comin g to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Today’s podcast is about asking for clarification w hen you don’t understand something at a business meeting. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was negotiating a contract with a new business pa rtner, and we had a meeting to clarify the terms.

Bill: If I understand the terms correctly, the leng th of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?

Ms. Samuels: Do you mean the contract for equipment  rental or the one for training?

Bill: I was under the impression that both contract s had the same terms.

Ms. Samuels: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarif y that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a cl ause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.

Bill: Could you elaborate on that?

Ms. Samuels: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in wr iting.

Bill: Let me see if I have that right. This contrac t is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six month s. Is that right?

Ms. Samuels: Yes, that's right.

Bill: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to t he other terms

[end of dialogue]

In today’s podcast, we’re talking about asking for clarification or trying to get someone to explain something to us that we don’t un derstand. “To clarify” (clarify) means to explain something you don’t unde rstand. Well, in the dialogue today, the story begins by Bill talking about how h e was negotiating a contract. “To negotiate” (negotiate) means to talk to someone  and try to come to an agreement, try to create an agreement between two p eople. Usually, this is a business term – you negotiate. You can always use t his in politics – two countries can negotiate. Well, here we’re negotiati ng a contract.

A “contract” (contract) is an agreement – a legal a greement between two people or two companies. In this story, the man is trying to negotiate a contract with a new business partner, someone he is going to work w ith. And they had a meeting to clarify the terms. Well, clarify – we already kn ow, to explain something you don’t understand. “Terms” (terms) - in business whe n we talk about the terms, we’re talking about the conditions or the parts of the contract – what the contract or agreement actually says. For example, one term of a contract could be how long the contract will last – one year, six months,  and so forth. Another term of the contract or part of the contract could be how m uch you are going to spend – how much money you are going to spend. So, those are all terms of a contract.

Well, Bill begins the conversation by saying, “If I  understand the terms correctly.” This is an expression that we would use before summ arizing or giving our interpretation or understanding of something. For e xample, someone is explaining a contract to you or someone is explaini ng anything to you. And you want to make sure that you understood. You want to check with that person. You say, “If I understand you correctly.” And here Bill  says, “If I understand the terms of the contract correctly.” He goes on then to give  his understanding – “The length of the contract would be one year with a one  year option.” An “option” (option) in a business contract means that you have  a possibility for continuing the contract for a longer time. And once the contra ct is over, you can continue it for more time.

Bill then says, “Is that correct?” – which is a way  of asking am I correct, do I understand correctly, is that correct. And Ms. Samu els says, “Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for traini ng?” “Do you mean” is a way you ask people to tell you more information – to ge t more information. You’re not quite sure what they don’t understand. You don’t un derstand what they don’t understand. So, you say, “Did you mean,” or “Do you  mean this or that?” “Training” (training) is sort of like classes for e mployees, for people who work for a company, it’s education – it’s giving them some m ore information about

something. So, you can go to a training to learn ho w to use the Macintosh PowerBook G4, for example – that’s my computer. I c ould go to a training about that – a class about that.

Bill then says, “I was under the impression that bo th contracts had the same terms.” “I was under the impression” (impression) –  when you say to someone, “I was under the impression,” you mean that is how I u nderstood it. “My understanding of this was,” and then you give your understanding. “I was under the impression that this girl loved me, but it turn s out she did not love me at all.” How sad huh? “I was under the impression that” – I understood, that’s what I understood.

Well, Ms Samuels says, “Let me see if I can clarify  that.” When somebody says, “Let me see if I can,” they mean give me the opport unity, allow me, let me do something. Here, it’s “Let me see if I can clarify”  – make it clear for you. And she says, “The terms of the contracts are the same” – t he two contracts or equipment rental – renting equipment and training. But that t he contract for training has a “clause” that allows for the cancellation after the  first six months. A “clause” is a part of the contract. It’s usually a sentence or tw o sentences or some part of the contract that is very – has a specific terms. A “cl ause” is one of the terms. But usually, it has to do – often has to do with an exc eption or something that’s different about the contract. So, the clause here a llows for or means that you can have a cancellation. And “to cancel,” of course mea ns to end something. So, a “cancellation” is an ending. So, what they’re sayin g here is that for one contract, they can end the contract after only six months.

Bill then asks Ms. Samuels to give him more informa tion. And one way to do that is to say, “Could you elaborate on that?” “Could yo u elaborate?” “To elaborate” (elaborate) means to give more detail, to give more  information, to elaborate. And Ms. Samuels says, “Sure” – yes. “What I mean is  that either side or either side – either pronunciation is correct – that eithe r side could cancel the training contract after six months as long as it’s in writin g.” “What I mean is” is another way of introducing an explanation. When someone doe sn’t understand you and you can say, “Well, what I mean is,” and then you t ry to explain it in a different way. In this case, the contract can be cancelled if  it is “in writing.” And when we say, “I want it in writing,” we mean I want it writ ten down on a piece of paper.

Bill says, “Let me see if I have that right.” This is another way of saying to the other person, “Okay, let me see if I understand you  correctly. Let me see. I’m going to tell you again what I think the situation is.” So, “Let me see if I have that right or correct.” And then he explains his underst anding of the contract – the contract is for six months of training but if it is n’t cancelled, continues for another

six months. “Is that right?” – meaning “Is that cor rect?” And Ms. Samuels says, “Yes, that’s right.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

I was negotiating a contract with a new business pa rtner, and we had a meeting to clarify the terms.

Bill: If I understand the terms correctly, the leng th of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?

Ms. Samuels: Do you mean the contract for equipment  rental or the one for training?

Bill: I  was under the impression that both contrac ts had the same terms.

Ms. Samuels: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarif y that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a cl ause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.

Bill: Could you elaborate on that?

Ms. Samuels: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in wr iting.

Bill: Let me see if I have that right. This contrac t is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six month s. Is that right?

Ms. Samuels: Yes, that's right.

Bill: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to t he other terms
