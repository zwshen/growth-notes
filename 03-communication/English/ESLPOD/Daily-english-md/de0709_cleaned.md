This episode is a conversation between Phil and Cam eron; Cameron is the woman in the dialogue.  It’s about taking someone f or granted, always a dangerous thing in a relationship.  Let’s get start ed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Phil:  Did you hear that Melissa has finally left E ric?  It’s about time! 

Cameron:  Oh, that’s sad.  It’s always sad when two  people can’t make it work. 

Phil:  Well, it wasn’t for a lack of trying, on Mel issa’s part.  She bent over backwards trying to please Eric and he always took her for granted.  If you ask me, Melissa was always too good for him. 

Cameron:  Really?  I don’t know Eric too well, but he seemed nice. 

Phil:  Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s rea lly a slimeball.  Trust me, I know.   

Cameron:  I believe you, but what’s Melissa going t o do now?   

Phil:  I think she should find a nice guy who’ll ap preciate her.   

Cameron:  Someone like you? 

Phil:  She could do worse.  I’d treat her right and  make her happy. 

Cameron:  You sound like a man with a plan. 

Phil:  “Be prepared.”  Isn’t that what the Boy Scou ts say?

Phil begins by saying to Cameron, “Did you hear tha t Melissa has finally left Eric? It’s about time!”  “Did you hear,” meaning did some one tell you or did you have this information.  The information is that Melissa – a girl, a woman – has finally left Eric.  The expression “to leave (someone),” wh en we’re talking about a romantic relationship, is to end the relationship.  Another way of saying this would be “to break up.”  We often use “to break up”  when we’re talking about two people ending their romantic connection – their rom antic relationship, but you can also simply use the verb “to leave.”  “To leave ” has many other meanings, of course; those can be found – some of them – in our Learning Guide.  Phil says, “It’s about time!”  That’s a phrase to show that yo u are happy, you are relieved that something has finally happened; you would hope d it would happen earlier, but now finally it has happened.  Phil is happy tha t Melissa has left Eric. Cameron says, “Oh, that’s sad.  It’s always sad whe n two people can’t make it work.”  “Make it work” means to try very hard to ma ke something successful. You’ll often hear that when people are talking abou t relationships: “They couldn’t make it work,” meaning they tried but it was not po ssible for them to continue their relationship.   

So, Cameron is sad.  Phil says, “Well, it wasn’t fo r lack of trying, on Melissa’s part.”  He’s saying that Melissa tried to make it w ork.  The expression “not for a lack of trying” is used to mean that someone did tr y very hard; they did attempt to do something, especially something that was difficu lt or perhaps unpleasant.  It’s almost always used in negative: “It’s not for a lac k of trying that I was not able to visit my brother today.”  I tried very hard.  I dro ve many miles, but the weather was bad and I wasn’t able to arrive on time; but it  was not for a lack of trying, meaning I tried very hard.  Phil says that Melissa tried very hard also.  He uses the expression “on Melissa’s part,” which means sim ply by Melissa.  Phil says that Melissa bent over backwards to try to please E ric.  “To bend over backwards” is an expression that means to do everyt hing possible for something to happen, especially when you are trying to make t hings easier for another person.  “Bent” is the past tense of the verb “to b end.”  So, Melissa bent over backwards, she tried very hard to please Eric.  “To  please,” as a verb, means to make someone happy or to make someone satisfied.  “ Please” has other meanings as well, and some of those are in our Lear ning Guide for this episode. 

Phil says that Eric took Melissa for granted.  “To take (someone) for granted” means not to appreciate what another person is doin g, to not appreciate his or her actions or behaviors, to not thank them, to not  recognize that they are doing  

something for you.  This is often something that mi ght happen in a relationship: you take the other person for granted.  Husbands, d o not take your wives for granted, they will not be very happy – trust me, I know!  So, Phil says that Eric took Melissa for granted.  He says, “If you ask me (meaning if you want my opinion), Melissa was always too good for him.”  Wh en you say someone “is too good for” someone else, you mean that they are bett er than someone, that that other person was not as good as they are and that t he other person did not deserve to be with this person that you think is to o good for the other one.  So, if Melissa is too good for Eric, that means that Eric is not as good a person as Melissa, and Melissa should try to find someone els e. 

Cameron says, “Really?  I don’t know Eric too well,  but he seemed nice.”  Phil says, “Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s rea lly a slimeball.”  “On the surface” means related to how you seem at first, be fore you really understand the other person; another word we might use is “superfi cially.”  It means that it appears that a person is one way, but once you get to know them better you realize that they aren’t that friendly, or they are n’t that nice, or they aren’t that smart, and so forth.  Phil says that Eric is nice o n the surface, but he’s really – he’s truly, actually – a slimeball.  A “slimeball” (slimeball) is an informal word describing someone who you don’t want to spend a lo t of time with because you don’t respect him; you don’t think that he’s a good  person.  He does bad things; he does tricky things; he does things in secret, pe rhaps, that are not very nice, or he’s not honest with the other person.  It’s a very  negative way to describe someone, usually a man, often used to talk about a man who is not nice to his romantic partners.   

Phil says, “Trust me, I know.”  Cameron says, “I be lieve you, but what’s Melissa going to do now?”  Phil says, “I think she should f ind a nice guy who’ll appreciate her.”  Phil thinks that Melissa should get a new ro mantic partner, someone who is a nice guy who will appreciate her.  “To appreciate ” is the opposite of “to take for granted.  “To appreciate (someone)” is to recognize  their good qualities, to value them, to let them know that you are happy, to thank  them.   

Cameron asks Phil, “Someone like you?” meaning shou ld Melissa be your romantic partner.  Phil says, “She could do worse.”   This is an interesting expression.  When you say someone “could do worse,”  you’re talking about something that isn’t perfect, but it’s not bad, and  it’s better than most other similar things.  In this case, Phil is saying that he’s not  perfect – he’s not the perfect person, but he’s a pretty good person, a good choic e for Melissa.  It’s often used to talk about romantic relationships; when you say that someone could do worse you mean that the person they are with isn’t perfec t, but there are a lot of other people who are worse.  Phil says, “I’d treat her ri ght and make her happy.”  I  

would treat Melissa right, meaning I would be kind,  I would be appreciative, thoughtful, nice, considerate of this person; I wou ld not do bad things to them. 

Cameron says, “You sound like a man with a plan.”  “A man with a plan” is someone who knows what he wants to do, who already has thought of things to do in order to accomplish what he wants to.  Phil s ays, “‘Be prepared.’  Isn’t that what the Boy Scouts say?”  “The Boy Scouts” is an o rganization that teaches young boys practical skills, values, and so forth.  I was a Boy Scout, I think, when I was a young boy.  The saying – the motto of the B oy Scouts – the expression that they use is “Be prepared,” meaning always be r eady.  In order to be prepared, of course, you have to work hard, you hav e to practice, you have to train, and those are some of the values that the Bo y Scouts are supposed to teach the young boys.  There’s also, of course, the  Girl Scouts, which is a similar organization for young girls. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
