This episode is a dialogue about choosing a place to live in a city or town. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leona: I want to live close to downtown. We can get  everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.

Jeremy: Downtown is always bustling and noisy, and the crime rate is really high. I’d rather have proximity to parks and open spaces.

Leona: If we lived downtown, we wouldn’t have to wo rry about commute time and traffic. I could walk to work and you could take pu blic transportation.

Jeremy: That’s true, but there aren’t any good scho ols near downtown.

Leona: Hello, we don’t have any kids.

Jeremy: Not yet. I want to settle down somewhere for a while, not move every couple of years.

Leona: Is that why you want to live in the suburbs?  The suburbs have no character. Everything is cookie-cutter.

Jeremy: That’s not true.

Leona: Downtown has character and it’s close to nig htlife.

Jeremy: That’s less important to me than a place in  a quiet neighborhood. Imagine lounging in the backyard or taking a walk in the park. We can raise our kids in a close-knit community.

Leona: I think you’re planning for a family that we  don’t have.

Jeremy: Yet!

Our dialogue begins with Leona saying to Jeremy, “I  want to live close to downtown.” “Downtown” (downtown) is the center of a  city, especially a larger city with a lot of businesses in it, but really any  city or town can have a downtown. Sometimes, in a small town, the downtown area is very small, only two or three blocks long. But in a big city, the do wntown area can be very large, such as here in Los Angeles. Leona wants to live cl ose to downtown.

She says, “We can get everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.” To travel “on foot” means to walk. It's just another way of s aying you can walk to these places. What kind of places? Well, Leona tells us that they can walk “to most amenities.” “Amenities” (amenities) are usually fea tures or aspects or things about a certain area or a certain place that make it more comfortable, more enjoyable.

Normally we talk about amenities in a hotel. For ex ample, the hotel might have a swimming pool and a spa. Those would be “amenities”  – nice things that add to the pleasure of being in the hotel. We don't usuall y talk about amenities in terms of places where you live, but it is possible, and t hat's what Leona is doing here. She’s saying that they can walk to all the interest ing things that they want. They will not have to get in their car and drive to diff erent places.

Jeremy says, “Downtown is always bustling and noisy .” “To be bustling” (busting) means to be very busy. A place where a lot of peopl e are coming and going could be described as “bustling.” “Noisy,” of cours e, is when there is a lot of loud noise. Noisy is usually a bad thing when you are th inking about where you want to live, and that’s certainly Jeremy's opinion. He doesn't want to live in the downtown area.

He says, “The crime rate is really high.” The “crim e rate” (rate) refers to the number of crimes that take place in a certain area.  If the crime rate is high, that means there is a lot of crime in that area – a lot of people who are being robbed or killed or having their cars stolen, and so forth . Jeremy says, “I’d rather” –

meaning I would prefer to – “have proximity to park s and open spaces.” “Proximity (proximity) to” something is closeness to something – how close you are to a certain thing. “Proximity to” refers to di stance.

We could say, “We are in close proximity to several  stores and gas stations.” Those things are close to us. They are not very far  from us. “Open spaces” refers to places like parks or areas where there aren't an y buildings. Jeremy doesn't want to be downtown. He wants the opposite of downt own. He wants to be in a place where there is a lot of open space.

Leona says, “If we lived downtown, we wouldn't have  to worry about commute time and traffic.” “To commute” (commute) means to travel from your house or apartment to the place where you work. Your “commut e time” would be how long it takes you to get there. For example, I used to w ork at the university, and when I did that, I had to commute about 45 minutes to an  hour each way. So, 45 minutes to get there and then 45 minutes to come ho me by car. That was my “commute time.”

Leona says if they lived in downtown, they wouldn't  have to worry about commute time – because they would be close to their  jobs, one supposes. Leona says, “I could walk to work and you could take publ ic transportation.” So, Leona works downtown, and Jeremy works somewhere close to  downtown where you can take public transportation. “Public transportat ion” refers to a government- owned bus or subway or train – anything that the av erage person can get on and use could be called public transportation.

It might not be owned by the government, although u sually in the United States the buses and trains and subways are owned by the l ocal government. The word “public” can mean owned by the government or it can  mean something that anyone can use, that you don't need any special per mission to use. You could have a private museum that is “open to the public,”  meaning anyone can go there. Jeremy still doesn't like Leona’s idea. He s ays, “That's true, but there aren't any good schools near downtown.”

Leona says, “Hello, we don't have any kids.” The us e of the word “hello” is supposed to be funny. When a person says something that indicates that he hasn't thought of something very obvious – that he' s not considering something that should be very clear to him – we might use this expression, or this word, “hello.” But we say it in a certain way – the way that Leona says it. “Hello,” meaning you are forgetting something or you are not  remembering something that is very obvious or that should be clear to you .

In this case, Jeremy is talking about schools for c hildren, and Leona reminds him that they don't have any children. Jeremy says, how ever, “Not yet,” meaning we don't yet have any kids, but we might in the future . He says, “I want to settle down somewhere for a while, not move every couple of years.” “To settle down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to move to a pla ce and stay there for a long time – to move to a certain community or neighborho od and stay there for many years.

Sometimes, the expression “to settle down” refers to a lot of different things that a young person might consider doing as they become adults and more mature, such as getting married, buying a house, having chi ldren. Those might also be considered part of “settling down” somewhere. Leona  says, “Is that why you want to live in the suburbs?” The “suburbs” (suburbs) are the areas outside of the main city.

Leona says, “The suburbs have no character.” “Chara cter” here refers to things that make a person or a place interesting. If you s ay, “This house has a lot of character,” you mean it's interesting. Perhaps it's  old and has some historic interest to you, or it might just be decorated in a  way that makes it interesting. Those would be uses of the term “character” in desc ribing the place.

Leona says, “Everything” – meaning everything in the suburbs – “is cookie- cutter.” “Cookie (cookie) - cutter (cutter)” is an expression that means the same, boring, not very original. If you think about makin g cookies, the things you eat, you might think about something that you use to mak e sure all the cookies are the same shape. That little kitchen instrument, tha t kitchen tool, is called a “cookie cutter,” and makes sure that all of the coo kies look the same.

So, if you want to make cookies in the shape of a b unny, then you would have a cookie cutter in the shape of a bunny, and you coul d make each cookie look that way. That is what cookie cutters are. But the expre ssion used in general conversation refers to things that are identical, b ut usually more than that – things that are considered not interesting, that la ck or don't have character.

Jeremy says, “That's not true” – what Leona said ab out the suburbs. Leona says, “Downtown has character and it’s close to nightlife .” “Nightlife” (nightlife) – one word – refers to things that you would do at night for excitement, such as going to a bar or going dancing. That would be all part of n ightlife. We usually associate the idea of nightlife with younger people who are g oing out and drinking and dancing and having a good time. All of that ends wh en you get married.

Jeremy says, “That's less important to me than a pl ace in a quiet neighborhood.” Jeremy is saying that nightlife is not important to  him. He says, “Imagine lounging in the backyard or taking a walk in the park.” “To lounge” (lounge) means to relax, usually by lying down in a chair or on a cou ch. Jeremy is talking about lounging in the backyard – in the place behind your  house.

He says, “We can raise our kids in a close-knit com munity.” “Close (close) - knit (knit)” refers to a group or a place where everyone  is very close to each other. They're all friends. They all care about each other . They all know each other. A “close-knit community” would be a neighborhood or a n area where everyone knows each other. Everyone is friends with each oth er. Jeremy wants to live in a close-knit community because it would be good for their children.

Leona says, “I think you’re planning for a family that we don't have,” and Jeremy responds by saying, “Yet,” meaning we don't have on e yet, but we will have a family someday.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Our scripts have character and are never cookie-cut ter. That's because they're written by a wonderful scriptwriter – Dr. Lucy Tse.
