Clerk: Yes, here is your reservation. You have a st andard room reserved for two nights. Is that right?

Rob: Actually, no. It should be a suite. I had book ed a non-smoking king.

Clerk: Oh, my mistake. The reservation is for a sui te and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed. I'm sorry for the error.

Rob: That's okay. I'm here a little early. Is it po ssible to check in right now?

Clerk: Sure, that's no problem. May I have your cre dit card? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals.

Our story begins with me saying, “I flew into Atlan ta the afternoon before a big meeting.” “To fly into” somewhere means to take an airplane to that place. “I flew into New York.” “I flew into Paris.” “I flew into H eathrow in London.” That means I've taken a plane to those places. A “big meeting”  can mean one of two things. It can mean a very important meeting. You might say, “ This is a big meeting for me,” meaning it's very important for me, important for my career. Or it can just mean a large meeting with lots of people. That woul d also be a “big meeting.”

“I hailed a taxi at the airport.” “To hail (hail) a  taxi (taxi)” means to put your arm out in order to get a taxicab to stop and pick you up. So, if you're in a big city, like New York City for example, you have to stand out in  the road and put your hand up and wave to hail a taxi. I asked the taxi driver  “how long it would take to get there.” “How long” means how much time, and the tax i driver said that “it would only be 20 minutes.”

After arriving at the hotel, “the doorman helped me  take my luggage to the check- in desk.” A “doorman” (doorman) – all one word – is  usually a man, though it doesn't necessarily have to be, who greets you at a  nice hotel and offers to help you with your luggage. “Luggage” (luggage) is what we call the bags where you keep the clothes for your trip. So, the doorman “he lped me take my luggage to the check-in desk.” The “check-in (check-in) desk” is the same as the “front desk.” It's the place where you go to register or to check in to a hotel.

I say to the woman at the check-in desk, “Hi, I’m c hecking in,” meaning “I just arrived and I want to register and go to my room.” So, the woman says, “Yes, here is your reservation,” meaning she sees, either  on the computer or on a piece of paper, the information about my reservatio n. She tells me that I have a “standard room.” A “standard room” is the regular o r most basic kind of room in a hotel. There are different types of room. There’s the standard room, and then there are, in many hotels, rooms called “suites.” A  “suite” (suite) is a bigger room, usually a nicer room, and a more expensive room.

 I tell the woman that I should have a suite reserve d for me, and then I say, “I booked a non-smoking king.” “To book” (book) means to reserve a room, or to make a reservation. “Non-smoking” means you can't s moke in the room. Most public places in the United States do not allow smo king, although most hotels still have smoking sections or smoking rooms. I asked for  a “non-smoking king.” The word “king” here refers to the size of the bed. A “ king bed,” also called a “king- size bed,” is the biggest bed.

Actually, there is a bed bigger than a regular king  bed. It's called a “California King,” and it's longer than the regular king bed. B ut a “king-size” is the biggest bed you will normally find. It sleeps two people ve ry comfortably. A smaller bed that is also good for two people is a “queen bed.” The queen is smaller than the king, and smaller than the queen bed is the “double  bed.” Two people can sleep in a double bed if they are very friendly or know e ach other really, really well.

The clerk then says, “Oh, my mistake,” meaning “I w as wrong. I made a mistake.” She then asks me for a credit card. She says they n eed “a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals.” To have somethi ng “on file” means to have a record of it; in this case, they need to have your credit card on file so they know what the credit card number is in case, for example , you leave without paying your bill. If you have your credit card on file, th en they have the number and can still charge.

She mentions “room charges and incidentals.” “Room charges” are the amount that it costs you to rent the room, and “incidental s” (incidentals) are all the other things that you pay for to use in a hotel room. So,  for example, a call on the telephone in your hotel room is an incidental. In m any hotels, each call on the telephone is 50 cents or a dollar. They will charge  you even when it's what we call a “local call,” which is a call within the sam e city.

Another incidental would be the room’s minibar. In some hotels, they have what's called a “minibar” (minibar), which is a small refr igerator that has food and drinks in it. Every day, the maid – the person who comes to clean your room – checks the minibar, and if you've taken something out, she  marks that down on a piece of paper, and then when you check out, when you lea ve, you have to pay for whatever you took from the minibar. That's another example of an “incidental.”

The woman then asked me to “verify the room rate.” The “room (room) rate (rate)” is the cost of the room, the price of the r oom. She tells me to “initial the next to the X.” “To initial” (initial) something me ans to write down the first letter of your first and last names. So, for Jeff McQuillan, I would initial “JM.” Often, on

very long official forms, instead of writing your w hole name you will just write your initials. “Initial next to the X” means write your initials on the line next to a little X that is printed on the form.

Then she asked me how many keys I will need. Of cou rse, in most modern hotels, they don't actually give you a key. They gi ve you a little card that looks like a credit card, and that is your electronic key . The clerk asked me, “Do you need any help with your bags?” meaning did I want s omeone to carry my luggage to my room for me. And I say, “No, I'm fine .” “No, I'm fine,” or “No, I'm fine. Thanks,” are polite ways of saying, “No, I do n't need any help, but thank you.”

Finally the woman says, “Enjoy your stay,” meaning my stay at the hotel. The time that you will be somewhere is your “stay” (sta y). If someone asks how long is your stay, and you answer “three days,” that mea ns you will be there for three days.

Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a normal speed.
