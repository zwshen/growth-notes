This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Crystal.  I t’s about two people who are going to buy things they need for their bedroo m; in this case, bedding. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Xavier:  Thanks for helping me decorate my new apartmen t.  Hey, where are you going?   

Crystal:  I’m going to the bedding department.  Now t hat you have a new bed, you’ll need new bedding. 

Xavier:  Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a  couple of pillows, and a blanket? 

Crystal:  That’s only the beginning.  Oh, feel these shee ts.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count. 

Xavier:  Thread count?   

Crystal:  You’ll need a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and  pillowcases.  Did you get a queen- or a king-size bed? 

Xavier:  It’s a full-size bed. 

Crystal:  Okay, you’ll need a comforter and a duvet cover, t oo, and this bed skirt will make your bed look really nice. 

 Xavier:  Bed skirt? 

Crystal:  Of course!  You can’t leave your mattress exposed.  That would look so tacky. 

Xavier:  If you say so… 

Crystal:  Wow, look at these canopies.  Don’t you think…?   

Xavier:  You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  No, tha t’s where I draw the line.

We begin with Xavier saying to Crystal, “Thanks for helpi ng me decorate my new apartment.”  “To decorate” means to make something more  beautiful by changing it or adding things to it.  Usually we’re talking about  a room in your house: “I’m going to decorate your room.”  Sometimes we use this whe n we are talking about preparing for a special event, putting things on the wa lls or putting other things in the room to prepare for a special event such as Christmas:  “We’re decorating the tree (the Christmas tree),” we’re putting things on i t to make it look nice. 

Xavier is decorating his apartment.  Crystal says, “I’m goin g to the bedding department.”  “Bedding” refers to things that you pu t on your bed, things like sheets and pillows and blankets; we’ll talk about all tho se in a minute.  “Bedding” is spelled (bedding).  There’s a word that’s pronounced,  in most cases, almost exactly the same – in fact, exactly the same, which is “betti ng” (betting).  In English, in normal conversation the “D” and the “T” if they are in between two vowels in a word are pronounced the same.  Although, if  someone doesn’t quite understand you they may over-pronounce it or hyper-pronoun ce it, they may say “bedding” versus “be tting.”  “Betting” refers to when you go the Las Vegas an d lose all your money, because you think you are good playing  cards or whatever. But in normal conversation: “bedding” – “betting,” sam e pronunciation.  Some English teachers try to tell you otherwise, but really th ey’re the same pronunciation in normal conversation. 

Anyway, Crystal says, “Now that you have a new bed, you’ll ne ed new bedding.” Xavier says, “Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a couple of pillows, and a blanket?”  “Sheets” are large, thin pieces of material – of fabric, that you put on your bed and you lie on top of these sheets when  you are sleeping.  When you are lying on the bed, you want to keep the bed itsel f clean, and also it’s usually not very comfortable unless you have some sheets on the re.  Xavier says  

 he also wants to just get a couple of pillows.  “Pillows”  are the large, soft things that you put your head on when you are sleeping.  Final ly, Xavier mentions getting a “blanket,” which is a large, thick piece of fa bric that keeps you warm. The sheet you put on top of the bed, then you lie on t he sheet, and then you put the blanket over you to keep you warm.  “Sheet” and “bl anket” have a couple of different meanings in English however, so please take a look at our Learning Guide today for some additional explanations. 

Crystal says, “That’s only the beginning.”  The sheets, the pillows, the blankets – that’s just the beginning.  “Oh,” she says, “feel these sh eets.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count.”  When you’r e buying bedding, especially sheets, the sheets are sometimes very high quality,  sometimes very low quality.  The good sheets – the high quality ones h ave a high “thread count.” The “thread” are the strings of the fabric that make up  the sheet, and if there are a lot of these in a small area, then the quality is usu ally higher.  It’s a better sheet if it has a high thread count.  “Thread” also refers to , for example, when you have a piece of clothing and there’s a hole in it, you want to close that hole, you use thread – little, tiny, thin, long piece of fabric.  Yo u also used thread if you are going to the doctor and having surgery and they put a h ole in your body, you’ll need surgical thread to close that.  But here, we’re no t putting any holes in your body; we’re just buying some sheets! 

Xavier says, “Thread count?”  He, of course, is a little con fused, as most men are – about many things, I should say!  Crystal says, “You’ll nee d a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and pillowcases.”  A “fitted sheet” is a special kin d of sheet that has elastic in each corner.  This is like a rubber band that helps kee p the sheet on the bed so that it stays on the bed; it doesn’t move around, it is tight on the bed.  A “flat sheet” is a sheet that doesn’t have elastic in it; it’s a sheet that will move around easily.  Some people put a fitted sheet and then, on t op of that, they’ll put a flat sheet, then, on top of that, they’ll put a blanket.  Y ou go in between the fitted sheet and the flat sheet.  The flat sheet is especially use ful if the blanket is a little rough on your skin. 

Crystal says that Xavier will also need pillowcases.  “Pillo wcases” are rectangular pieces of fabric that have an opening on one end, and yo u put the pillow inside of it, so it covers the pillow.  It’s a “pillow cover,” we a lso could call it, but more commonly, a “pillowcase.”  Then Crystal asks Xavier, “Did you  get a queen- or a king-size bed?”  A queen bed is smaller than a king-sized b ed.  Xavier says, “It’s a full-size bed,” which is smaller than a queen bed.  T he things that you sleep on, called “mattresses,” come in different sizes; the king is th e largest.  Actually, larger than a king is what’s called a “California king.”   I guess we people here in California need big beds – maybe because we’re so fat, I ’m not sure!  

 Crystal says that Xavier will need a comforter and a duvet  cover.  A “comforter” is like a blanket; it is used to keep you warm at night.  U sually, though, it is filled with feathers or other man-made material.  It’s a li ttle bigger, usually a little thicker, or can be, than a regular blanket, which might  be a little thinner than a comforter.  A “duvet cover” is a large, rectangular piece of fabric – of material that is open at one end so that you can put the comforter insi de of it.  So basically it is like a pillowcase except it’s a pillowcase for the comforter  – for this large, thick blanket so that it doesn’t get dirty.  Many people have co mforters without duvet covers, however. 

Crystal also says that Xavier will need a bed skirt to make  the bed look nice.  A “skirt,” normally, is what a woman wears on her hips that  go down to her thigh, in the middle of her leg – unless it’s a miniskirt, in which  case it goes down not very far at all!  But here, we’re talking about a “bed skir t.”  It’s a piece of fabric that goes along the bottom of the bed so that you can’t see u nderneath the bed, basically.  Usually this is something you’ll find in a hotel  or in a very fancy house; it’s not something that many people have, but it is possib le to get one, these bed skirts. 

Xavier says, “Bed skirt?”  Crystal says, “Of course!  You can’t l eave your mattress exposed.”  The “mattress,” remember, is a large, thick surface that you lie on; it’s what you put the sheet on – the fitted she et.  “Exposed” means visible, shown, usually in talking about something that shouldn’t be shown or should not be visible.  So she says, “You can’t leave (you can’t have) yo ur mattress exposed,” you don’t want people to be able to see the m attress, “That would look so tacky.”  “Tacky” (tacky) means ugly, unpleasant to look at, something that isn’t very fashionable, something that is not in good taste. 

Xavier then says, “If you say so,” meaning you’re the expert.   Then Crystal says, “Wow, look at these canopies.”  A “canopy” (canopy) is a la rge piece of fabric (material) that hangs above the bed, sometimes – usually – for decoration, although it also helps keep insects away, if you have insect s in your house, little flies, for example, mosquitoes.  But it’s something you wo uld usually, again, see only in a very formal setting; not even a hotel would have that, in most cases. That’s a “canopy.” 

Crystal says, “Don’t you think…?” suggesting perhaps that Xavie r get a canopy, and Xavier says, “You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  N ow, that’s where I draw the line.”  The expression “to draw the line” me ans to limit something, to indicate that you are not going to do that thing, tha t that is too much.  For example, you may be going shopping for clothing with your  wife, and she says,  

 “Hold my purse,” the bag that she keeps her personal thin gs in.  So you hold her purse, and then she says, “Hold my jacket,” and so you hold h er jacket.  And then, she picks up a dress and says, “Hmm, I wonder how this looks.  Put this dress on.”  Then, the typical husband would say, “Wait a minute, I draw the line at putting on a dress,” meaning I’m not going to do t hat; I did these other things, but I’m not going to put a dress on.  Seems reasonable to me! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Xavier:  Thanks for helping me decorate my new apartmen t.  Hey, where are you going?   

Crystal:  I’m going to the bedding department.  Now t hat you have a new bed, you’ll need new bedding. 

Xavier:  Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a  couple of pillows, and a blanket? 

Crystal:  That’s only the beginning.  Oh, feel these shee ts.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count. 

Xavier:  Thread count?   

Crystal:  You’ll need a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and  pillowcases.  Did you get a queen- or a king-size bed? 

Xavier:  It’s a full-size bed. 

Crystal:  Okay, you’ll need a comforter and a duvet cover, t oo, and this bed skirt will make your bed look really nice. 

Xavier:  Bed skirt? 

Crystal:  Of course!  You can’t leave your mattress exposed.  That would look so tacky. 

Xavier:  If you say so… 

Crystal:  Wow, look at these canopies.  Don’t you think…?   

 Xavier:  You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  No, tha t’s where I draw the line.
