[start of dialogue]

Monique: Ugh!

Jurgen: What’s the matter?

Monique: My GP referred me to a specialist for my b ack problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks! I’m wait listed in case there’s a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.

Jurgen: Can’t you just go see another specialist?

Monique: I could, but my GP says that she’s the bes t in the business. In the meantime, I’ll try to see a physical therapist abou t my neck. It’s flaring up again.

Jurgen: At least you’ll get some relief.

Monique: Maybe. I have to call back tomorrow mornin g to see if she can fit me in. She’s really booked up, too. While I’m waiting, I g uess I could try to see the podiatrist about my feet.

Jurgen: You’re having feet problems, too?

Monique: Yeah, my whole body is falling apart. I th ink I’m nearly past my expiration date!

Monique begins our little dialogue by saying, “Ugh. ” She’s expressing disappointment about something, we’re not sure what . Jurgen asks her, “What’s the matter?” meaning what is the problem? Monique s ays, “My GP referred me to a specialist for my back problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks.” Your “GP” is your general practitioner. A “ general practitioner” is a medical doctor who provides what we might describe as “general care.” If you’re sick or have a problem, the first person, the first  doctor you would probably go to see would be your “general practitioner,” or your “ GP.” That’s the doctor who handles all sorts of cases, all sorts of problems.

If your problem is one the doctor – the GP – cannot  solve or cannot help you with, he may send you to a specialist. A “specialis t” (specialist) is a medical doctor who knows a lot about one particular kind of  problem or topic. You could have a specialist in cancer. You could have someone  who is a specialist in bones. You could have someone who is a specialist in feet. Doctors have all sorts of specialties that they can focus on or conc entrate on, and that’s the problem Monique is having. Her GP referred her to a  specialist for her back problems. However, the specialist doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks.

An “opening” is an appointment that is available, a  time when you can go in and see a certain person – in this case, a doctor. Howe ver, this doctor doesn’t have any available appointments for eight weeks. Monique  says, “I’m waitlisted in case there is a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.” “To be waitlisted” (wai tlisted) means to have your name put on a list so that if someone decides not to go to their appointment – if someone cancels their appointment – you can take th eir place.

What will often happen is that doctor will call you , or the doctor’s receptionist or nurse will call you, and tell you, “Hey, we have an  available appointment at ten o’clock tomorrow morning because someone canceled” – someone said they could not make it, even though they had an appointm ent scheduled. That’s what a “cancellation” is – when someone says, “No, I can ’t make it to that appointment”; “I won’t be able to go to that appoin tment.” Monique has been waitlisted. She’s on a “waiting list,” waiting for someone to cancel.

Monique says if there is not a cancellation, she’ll  have to endure the pain “for at least another eight weeks.” “To endure” (endure) me ans to suffer from something for a long period of time, but you don’t complain a bout it. So, someone who

“endures” suffering or “endures” pain has the pain,  suffers from the pain, feels the pain, but doesn’t complain about it – is “brave ” about it, we might say.

Jurgen says, “Can’t you just go see another special ist?” meaning isn’t it possible for you to see a different doctor, a different spec ialist? Monique says, “I could, but my GP says that she is the best in the business .” Her doctor is telling her that this particular specialist is “the best in the busi ness.” The word “business” here just means area or field or type of work. To say so meone is “the best in the business” means that they are the best at what they  do. They may be the best baseball player. They may be the best manager. They  may be the best podcaster. Whatever the occupation or whatever the area of work is, this person is the best at doing that.

Monique says, “In the meantime,” while she’s waitin g, “I’ll try to see a physical therapist about my neck.” “A physical therapist” (t herapist) is a person who helps you recover after you have had an injury. For examp le, if you hurt your leg – let’s say you break your leg in an accident – after your leg gets better, you may have to go to physical therapy to help you strengthen the muscles again in your leg. The physical therapist will do things to help you r ecover or get better from this injury. Usually it’s an injury to a muscle or somet hing related to your arms and legs.

Monique says, “It’s flaring up again.” “To flare (f lare) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get worse, especially when we’re ta lking about pain or some sort of illness or sickness that gets better and th en it gets worse and then it gets better again. It’s a temporary increase in the pain  or in whatever health problem you have. You could talk about your allergies “flar ing up.” That would mean your allergies would suddenly be getting worse. You have  an allergy when your body reacts negatively to some substance or something th at it comes in contact with, either by breathing or by eating or by touching.

Monique doesn’t have an allergy. She has a back pro blem, and it’s flaring up once more. Jurgen says, “At least you’ll get some r elief.” “Relief” (relief) is a reduction in pain or a release from pain – when you  get better and you no longer feel the pain. There used to be a commercial on tel evision about an antacid – something that would help your stomach feel better if it wasn’t feeling well. The name of the antacid was Rolaids, and the commercial  said, “How do you spell relief?” But then the person on the commercial spel led “Rolaids” (Rolaids).

Well, that’s actually not how you spell relief. We spelled it for you already, but that’s just something I think of when I am spelling  the word “relief,” that old commercial. Back to our story: Monique says maybe s he’ll get some relief –

maybe she’ll feel better from the pain that she is feeling by going to see a physical therapist. She says, “I have to call back tomorrow morning to see if she” – the physical therapist – “can fit me in.”

The expression “to fit someone in” or “to fit in” s omeone means to arrange your appointments so that you can see someone who didn’t  have an appointment before. When a doctor, for example, has a very busy  schedule, he has someone that he’s going to see every hour. But then one of his patients calls and asks him if he can fit her in – if he can find time to see h er even though she doesn’t have an appointment. That’s what Monique wants to do.

Unfortunately, the physical therapist is “really bo oked up.” “To be booked (booked) up” means to have a lot of commitments, to  be very busy, to not have any appointments available. Monique says, “While I’ m waiting, I guess I could try to see the podiatrist about my feet.” A “podiatrist ” (podiatrist) is a doctor whose specialty is feet, a doctor who takes care of your feet if you have some sort of problem with them. Monique has a back problem, but now we learn she also has a foot problem. Jurgen says, “You” [have] “feet pro blems, too?”

Monique says, “Yeah, my whole body is falling apart .” The phrasal verb “to fall apart” means to no longer work properly, usually be cause it’s very old. We talk about a machine falling apart after many years. You  might have a machine you use to wash your clothing, for example. But after m any years, it starts to have problems. It begins to fall apart – to not work pro perly. Monique says her body is “falling apart.” We normally don’t use this phrasal  verb when talking about your body, but Monique is making a little joke here, com paring her body to a machine.

She says, “I think I’m nearly past my expiration da te.” An “expiration (expiration) date” is a time or a date that is put on, usually, a package with food in it, that tells you the date by which you need to eat the food. For  example, if you buy milk and it says the expiration date is June 20th, that mean s that you should drink the milk by June 20th. Actually, you usually can drink it for a few days after that. The idea of an expiration date, then, is a date after which you probably shouldn’t eat a certain kind of food or drink a certain kind of dri nk.

Monique again is making a joke here, comparing her body to food – I guess saying that she’s nearly past her expiration date, meaning she’s getting old and that’s why her body is falling apart.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Monique: Ugh!

Jurgen: What’s the matter?

Monique: My GP referred me to a specialist for my b ack problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks! I’m wait listed in case there’s a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.

Jurgen: Can’t you just go see another specialist?

Monique: I could, but my GP says that she’s the bes t in the business. In the meantime, I’ll try to see a physical therapist abou t my neck. It’s flaring up again.
