This episode is a conversation between Dale and Jessie talki ng about something which is very popular, Internet forums, or Internet discussi on groups.  I’ll talk about some vocabulary that you will commonly find when you are talking about these kinds of Internet groups.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dale:  I didn’t know you read that forum.  What’s your  screen name?

Jessie:  It’s “jessiegirl,” but I don’t post very often.  I  like to lurk and follow the different threads, but I prefer to keep a low profile .

Dale:  Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my new  web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.

Jessie:  That’s cool.  I’ve been trying to figure out how to upload a picture for my avatar.  Are there instructions in the FAQs?

Dale:  I’m not sure, but I can show you how to do it.  Have you been following the thread about the presidential campaign?

Jessie:  Yeah, I had been...until today.

Dale:  Why’s that?

Jessie:  I stopped reading when this one guy, “bigman,” st arted to flame everybody, saying that anyone who didn’t agree with him is an idiot.

 Dale:  Oh, really?

Jessie:  Yeah, he started posting replies, writing in all  caps and letting people have it.  He quoted people out of context and attacked them.  What a jerk!

Dale:  Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk.

Jessie:  Hey, what did you say your screen name is?

Dale:  Never mind.

Our dialogue begins with Dale saying, “I didn’t know you  read that forum.  What’s your screen name?”  A “forum” is another name for an In ternet discussion group, where people write on a website and communicate about a particular topic.  Your “screen name” is usually a short name or a combination of letters and numbers that someone uses to identify him or herself.  Many peop le don’t want to use their real names, so they come up with these screen names that they use instead.

Jessie responds by saying, “It’s ‘jessiegirl,’” meaning her scre en name is “jessiegirl.”  She says, “I don’t post very often.”  To “po st means to put text, or photographs, or video, or something else on a website.  For example, I post to our blog – our ESL Podcast Blog about once a week.  You  can post a comment to our blog posts whenever you’d like.  The word “post” h as several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Jessie says, “I like to lurk (lurk) and follow different th reads.”  To “lurk” (lurk) in a forum or a discussion group means that you go to the for um – you go to the website and you read what other people have written bu t you don’t participate yourself; you don’t post anything – any messages yourself.  T o lurk, in general, means to be sort of hiding so that no one can see you, bu t you’re observing. This is a case where we use that verb to mean you read, bu t you don’t reply – you don’t post.  A “thread” (thread) in an Internet f orum is a group of messages that are responses to each other; they’re a group of rel ated messages.  We can also use this word more generally, for example someone sa ys, “I don’t quite follow the thread of your conversation,” meaning I don ’t quite understand the meaning, how different things are connected to each oth er.  “Thread,” as a noun, is what you use in clothing to keep the clothing together  – to keep different parts of the clothing together.  For example, on a shirt the re are sleeves that go over

 the arms, and those are probably connected or attached to the rest of the shirt using thread.  But “thread,” here, means a group of co nnected messages.

Jessie says that she prefers to keep a low profile.  To “kee p a low profile” means to act in a way so that other people don’t pay very much attention to you – don’t notice you.  I’m going to keep a low profile – I’m going to make sure people don’t interest themselves in me.

Dale says, “Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my n ew web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.”  So, Da le says he posts a lot; he put his new website – his web address on his profile.  A “profile” is a small collection of information about a person, or perhaps a company.  In many websites you can see other people’s profiles; you can see wha t they’ve said about themselves, perhaps their age, where they live, and  so forth.  An “avatar” (avatar) is a small picture that represents a person on a website, usually something that you create or you select.  And so, you’ll se e your name and then underneath you’ll see an avatar.  Most forums don’t req uire an avatar, but people like to put pictures of themselves or their cats or other  imaginary beings as their avatar.  I don’t think I’ve ever used an avatar, but it’ s popular among many people on Internet forums.

Jessie says, “That’s cool.  I’ve been trying to figure out ho w to upload a picture for my avatar.”  To “upload” means to transfer files fr om your computer to a website.  Jessie says, “Are there instructions in the FAQs (o r the frequently asked questions)?”  Most websites have an “FAQ,” or frequen tly asked questions page; it’s a list of the most common questions that peop le ask about a website or a product that is on the website, and it gives the answe rs.  It’s the first place you look on a website for help if there’s something you don ’t understand.

Dale says, “I’m not sure (I’m not sure if there are inst ructions in the FAQs), but I can show you how to do it.  Have you been following the  thread about the presidential campaign?”  Notice the use of the verb “fo llow” – to follow the thread. We said earlier that you could use that in a conversation : “I’m not following the threat of your conversation.”  We also use it in Intern et discussion groups.  To “follow a thread” means to be reading all of the messa ges about a particular topic that are related to each other.

Jessie says, “Yes, I had been (I was following it)...until today.”  Dale says, “Why’s that?” meaning what is the reason why.  Jessie says, “I sto pped reading when this one guy, (with the screen name) ‘bigman,’ started to flame everybody, saying that anyone who didn’t agree with him is an idiot.”  This is what I think; of course, it’s what we all think, that we’re right about everyth ing!  To “flame” (flame) means

 to send a message or post a note that is considered rude, impolite, angry.  It’s a not very nice thing you say about someone else; often it’ s a personal attack on a person.  “Flame” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, Jessie stopped following this thread because there wa s someone who was flaming everybody.  Dale says, “Oh, really?”  Jessie says, “Yea h, he started posting replies, writing in all caps and letting people  have it.”  A “reply” is a response, an answer to a message.  “Caps” (caps) refers to ca pital letters, what we sometimes call “upper case” letters.  Usually you just u se caps, or a capital letter to begin a sentence or a name.  But if you typ e in all caps, many people on the Internet think that’s like shouting.  Instead of usi ng upper and lower case letters, you use all capital letters – all upper case let ters – all caps, it’s considered a little angry or impolite on an Internet f orum.  “To let people have it” – “to let someone have it” means to show someone that you are angry with him or her, usually by yelling or shouting.  “I let him ha ve it” means I shouted at him, I yelled at him, I told him I was angry.

Jessie says this person “quoted people out of context and att acked them.  What a jerk!”  To “quote” someone means to repeat what someo ne else has said; that’s very common on Internet forums.  “Out of context,” here, means taking information and eliminating, or leaving out the surro unding information, the information that tells you what it really means.  So, yo u take one small thing a person said and you remove it from the comments around it that would make it seems sensible or logical, and you use that quote to att ack someone, to imply that they have a different meaning.

Dale says, “Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk” – a bad guy.  Jessie says, “Hey, what did you say your screen name was?”  Jessie’s wondering what Dale’s screen name was, and Dale says, “Never mind.”   “Never mi nd” is a phrase used to show that something is not important and should be forgotten.  Of course, perhaps Dale is this “bigman,” this person who was flamin g other people, and he didn’t want to admit that to his friend Jessie.

I certainly hope you don’t flame anyone on your Interne t forums, if you participate in them.  I don’t generally participate in Internet f orums, but some people really love them and find they are a good way to connect to oth er people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Dale:  I didn’t know you read that forum.  What’s your  screen name?

Jessie:  It’s “jessiegirl,” but I don’t post very often.  I  like to lurk and follow the different threads, but I prefer to keep a low profile .

Dale:  Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my new  web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.
