This episode is called “Differences in Male and Female F riendships.”  It’s a dialogue between Lauren and Quentin, and talks about how men and women are different when it comes to their friends, using a lot of vocabulary you might use when talking about friendship.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren:  Did you see what Stephanie was wearing?  She looked like a wet dog!

Quentin:  Why do women do that?

Lauren:  Do what?

Quentin:  Why do women put other women down?  Is it to make themselves feel superior?

Lauren:  It was only a joke.  I didn’t mean anything by it.

Quentin:  Do you really think she would find it funny i f she had heard you?

Lauren:  What about you men?  You guys are always banter ing and trying to one-up each other.  Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s su perior and who’s inferior?

Quentin:  Women are catty and talk behind each other’s b acks.  We men make fun of each other in a good-natured way while we’re together.  That’s the difference: You women are laughing at  each other and we men are laughing with each other.

 Lauren:  Oh yeah?  Was Tim laughing with  you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?

Quentin:  That was very funny, and yes, he thought it wa s funny, too.  What you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get .  Next time, Tim will play a trick on someone else.

Lauren:  So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.

Quentin:  Yeah, you could say that.  That’s how men bond .  That’s something you women don’t seem to understand.

Lauren:  We understand, all right.  You take turns to rturing each other and call it male bonding.

Quentin:  See what I mean?  You women stick to your wa ys and we’ll stick to ours.

Lauren begins by asking Quentin, “Did you see what Steph anie was wearing? She looked like a wet dog!”  A “wet dog” I guess is an i nsulting term; a wet dog would not look very good, I guess is the idea.  Quentin says, “Why do women do that?”  Lauren says, “Do what?” meaning I don’t unders tand what you’re talking about.  Quentin says, “Why do women put other women do wn?”  “To put (someone) down” is a phrasal verb meaning to say somethin g that makes another person seem or feel less important; to say someth ing mean, something not nice about someone else is to put them down.  Quent in is asking Lauren why women put other women down, why they insult other wom en.  Quentin says, “Is it to make themselves feel superior?”  “Superior” means bett er than someone else. The opposite of “superior” is “inferior.”

So, Quentin is asking Lauren if women insult each other – say bad things about each other – to make themselves feel superior, like they’r e better than the other women.  Lauren says, “It was only a joke.  I didn’t mean anything by it.”  When someone says they “don’t mean anything by it,” they mean that they know that they said something that was not kind – that was mean, bu t they didn’t really want to hurt anyone’s feelings.  Usually we say this when w e say something bad but we aren’t thinking about it very clearly before we say it, and after we say it we regret it.  We think, “Oh, I should not have done tha t,” and so we say “Oh, I didn’t mean anything by it.”  I didn’t mean – I didn’t inte nd to hurt her.

 Quentin says, “Do you really think she would find it funn y if she had heard you?” What Quentin is saying here is that Lauren’s comment wa s not a joke, it was not funny, and Stephanie would not think it funny if she he ard it.  Lauren says, “What about you men?  You guys are always bantering and trying to one-up each other.”  “To banter” (banter) means to have a friend ly conversation with lots of jokes, especially jokes about other people in the conversat ion.  So when people banter, they’re making jokes and some of those jokes are a bout the people in that group.  Lauren says, “You guys (you men) are always b antering and trying to one-up each other.”  “To “one-up (someone)” means to d o or say something to show that you can do something better than the other pe rson; you are superior to the other person; you can beat them.  Lauren is saying th at men are always trying to one-up each other, to be better – to seem b etter than the other.  “Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s superior and who’s inferior?”  Remember, “inferior” is the opposite of “superior,” it means worse than some one or something else.

Quentin says, “Women are catty and talk behind each other ’s backs.”  “To be catty” (catty) means that you say nice things about someone w hen they are there – when they are next to you or in front of you, but th en when they leave – when they are not there you say mean things or unkind things a bout them.  So you could say to someone, “Oh, that’s a beautiful dress you ha ve on Maria,” and Maria walks away and you say to your friend, “That is the  ugliest dress I have ever seen!”  That would be catty.  Quentin is saying that  women are catty.  I’m not saying women are catty – Quentin is saying that; I wan t to make that very clear!  Quentin also says that women talk behind each oth er’s back.  “To talk behind (someone’s) back” means to say bad things about a nother person when he or she can’t hear them, doesn’t know what you are sayi ng.  You tell everyone that you think the boss is a terrible manager, but when the boss is there in the room you don’t say anything.  That’s talking behind someo ne’s back.  Quentin says, “We men make fun of each other in a good-natured w ay while we’re together.”  “To make fun of (someone or something)” me ans to make jokes about that thing or that person.  To make fun of someone is u sually considered mean – not nice, but Quentin says that when men do it they are doing in a good-natured way.  “Good-natured” means in a friendly way.  You’re n ot really being mean; you’re not really being unkind.  Quentin says, “That’s the  difference: You women are laughing at  each other and we men are laughing with  each other.”

Lauren says, “Oh yeah (meaning she doesn’t believe what Q uentin is saying)? Was Tim laughing with  you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?”  Apparently Quentin and his friends threw Tim , another friend, into a lake – I’m not sure why – as a joke.  In fact, Quentin says,  “That was very funny,

 and yes, he thought (Tim thought) it was funny, too.  W hat you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get.”  “To give  as good as you get” is an expression that means we do to another person whateve r he or she has done to us; usually it’s in a negative way.  So you, as a man, m ay make a joke about another friend – another man, but that friend will also make a joke about you, so you give as good as you get.  “Next time,” Quentin says, “T im will play a trick on someone else.”  “To play a trick on (someone)” means to fo ol or deceive someone, to do something that surprises someone and makes that person looks silly or stupid.

Lauren says, “So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.”  A “vicious (vici ous) cycle” is a situation where A causes B, which causes C, which causes A, whi ch causes B, and so forth; that one thing causes another thing that  causes another thing that causes the first thing, and the cycle repeats.  Things go a round and around.  A vicious cycle is usually a cycle or a situation where things are getting worse and worse.  When the economy is bad, people lose their jobs , and when they lose their jobs they don’t have money to buy things at the sto re.  And when they don’t have money to buy things at the store, the people in the  store lose their jobs and they have less money to spend, and that causes more people  to lose their jobs. So it’s a vicious cycle.  A “prank” (prank) is some sort of tri ck – some sort of joke, but it’s usually something you do.  When I was young in scho ol one popular prank was to go to someone’s house that you didn’t like an d throw toilet paper all over the trees.  I never did this, honestly!  But that wa s a prank that some other people did – I won’t name any names!

Quentin says, “You could say that (meaning yes, it’s a viciou s cycle of pranks). That’s how men bond” (bond).  “Bond” means to develop a close relationship with someone.  It is no relation to Bond – James Bond, the famous British spy, 007. This is a different kind of bond.  Here it’s a verb, an d it means to have a close connection or relationship with someone.  Quentin says, “T hat’s something you women don’t seem to understand.”

Lauren says, “We understand, all right (meaning yes, in  fact, we do understand). You take turns torturing each other and call it male bo nding.”  “To torture (someone)” means to cause pain, either physical or psycholo gical, usually because you are trying to get someone to do something, to give you information perhaps.  Quentin says, “See what I mean (now do you und erstand)?  You women stick to your ways and we’ll stick to ours (we men wil l stick to ours).”  “To stick to” is a phrasal verb meaning continue doing somethi ng, continue using something without changing.  I’m going to stick to recor ding podcasts because I’m not very good at anything else.  That’s pretty much tr ue!

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.
