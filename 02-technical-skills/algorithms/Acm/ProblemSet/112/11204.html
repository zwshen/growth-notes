<h2 CLASS="western"><font color="#0070e8">The Problem</font></h2>

<p><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Julio is a musician who teaches classical
music at secondary school. Julio has <em>N</em> musical instruments to distribute among
his <em>M</em> students, <em>N</em> &ge; <em>M</em>. To make an adequate distribution,
Julio asked each student to list the <em>N</em> musical instruments in order of priority.
Julio wants to make a distribution in which the biggest <span class="GramE">number of
students have</span> their favourite musical instrument, but
there may be several possibilities. He wants to know how many possible arrangements
--maximizing the assignment of the first priority-- can be obtained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">You must write a program which computes
how many different distributions are possible, supposing the biggest number of students
have their <span class="SpellE">favourite</span> musical instrument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2 CLASS="western"><font color="#0070e8">The Input</font></h2>

<p><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">The first line of the input contains the
number of test cases. For each test case, there is a line with two numbers, <i>N</i>
indicating the number of musical instruments, and <em>M</em> indicating the number of
students, 32 &ge; <em>N</em> &ge; <em>M</em>. Subsequently, <i>M</i> lines are listed,
one for each student; each line contains, separated by one space, <em>N</em> numbers
between 1 and <em>N</em> which determine the priority of the corresponding student. The
first number is the priority of the first musical <span class="GramE">instrument,</span>
the second number is the priority of the second musical instrument, and so on. </span></p>

<h2 CLASS="western"><font color="#0070e8">The Output</font></h2>

<p><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">For every test case you are to print a
line containing a number which represents how many possible distributions can be obtained.</span></p>
