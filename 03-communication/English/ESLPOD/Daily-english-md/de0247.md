# Asking for Recommendations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 247: Asking for Recommendations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  247.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii - no, just kidding!  In beautiful Los Angeles, California, but Honolulu is very beautiful, too!

This podcast is going to be about “Asking for Recom mendations,” when you want someone to help you, and you're asking for their op inion or their advice about something.  In this particular dialogue Victor is g oing to be talking with someone at a hotel - a person who works for the hotel - to try to get some recommendations about things in that area.  Let's g et started > Hotel Clerk:  Can I help you with something?
> Victor:  Yes, I was hoping you could recommend a re staurant nearby.
> Clerk:  What kind of food would you like?
> Victor:  I’m not picky.  I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.
> Clerk:  There’s a good seafood restaurant called “G aleno’s” about two blocks away.  Would you like me to make a reservation for you?
> Victor:  Thanks, but that won’t be necessary.  I ne ed to check with my guest before deciding.  By the way, I’ll be in town for f our days, and I’d like to see the sights.
> Clerk:  Is this your first time here?
> Victor:  Yes, it is.
> Clerk:  Then, I’d suggest seeing our museums and the botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.
> Victor:  Can I get there on foot?
> Our episode begins with the hotel clerk asking Vict or, “Can I help you with something?”  That would be a very polite, standard thing that an employee of a company, such as a hotel or a store, might ask you when they are asking if you need some help - “Can I help you with something?”  Or, they may say, “Do you need some help?”

Victor says, “Yes, I was hoping you could recommend  a restaurant nearby.” There's another polite expression - “I was hoping” - “I was hoping you could help me.”  The use of the “I was hoping” is, again, a li ttle more polite.  You're not demanding - you're not saying you must help me, you 're saying I was hoping that you would be able to help me.

The clerk asks what kind of food Victor likes, beca use he's asking for a restaurant recommendation.  Victor says, “I’m not p icky,” “picky.”  To be picky means to be very selective - difficult to please.  Children are sometimes picky about the kind of food that they will eat.  When I was young, if you were picky, you just didn't eat anything because my brothers an d sisters would eat whatever food you didn't want.

Victor says, “I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.”  The phrase moderately, “moderately,” me ans not too expensive.  Not necessarily something with a very low price, but no t something that is very expensive - something in between - moderately.  So,  he wants a restaurant that is not too expensive but still pretty good, in term s of the quality, and he wants something “that's within walking distance.”

Walking distance is the distance you can walk, usua lly a person means within 15, 20, maybe 25 minutes of walking.  It depends on who  you are and how far you

want to walk, but I would say that if you were at a  hotel and you asked for a restaurant within walking distance, you're looking for something within 10, 15, maybe 20 minutes from your hotel.  You could also s ay how many blocks it is from your location, but even though the expression is walking distance, we usually give the person the amount of time it would  take for the average person to walk.  So, perhaps we should say, “walking time, ” but we don't.

The clerk says, “There’s a good seafood restaurant called 'Galeno’s' about two blocks away.  Would you like me to make a reservati on for you?”  To make a reservation means to call the restaurant and to say , “I am going to becoming and eating there.”  Usually you tell them how many peop le there will be and the time that you will be coming.

Victor says, “Thanks, but that won’t be necessary.  I need to check with my guest before deciding.”  To check with someone means that  you need to ask someone's opinion before deciding what to do.  If y ou're married and you’re a man, you know that you can't do anything important unless you check with your wife.  I know that's true in my life!

So, Victor is going to check with his guest - the p erson he is with - before he decides.  To check with actually has a couple of di fferent meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide today for some additional def initions.

Victory then says, “By the way, I’ll be in town for  four days, and I’d like to see the sights.”  The expression by, “by,” the way, “way,” is used when you want to say something or ask something that isn't necessarily c onnected or related to what you just said.  So, it's a way of changing the topi c in a conversation.

Victor is answering the clerk by telling him that h e needs “to check with his guest before deciding,” then he thinks of something else he wants to ask the clerk that is not related, so uses the expression by the way.  “By the way, I'll be in town,” meaning I'll be here, in this city “for four days, and I’d like to see the sights.”  To see the sights, “sights,” means to see the importan t or interesting places in the city - the places that someone who is visiting the city would want to see.  So, if you go to Paris, you would want to see the Eiffel T ower.  If you come to Los Angeles, you would want to see Hollywood, and of co urse, the Center for Educational Development!

Victor says that he's going to be in town for four days, and the clerk asks, “Is this your first time here” - the first time you visited this city.

Victor says, “Yes.”  The clerk then says, “Then, I’ d suggest seeing our museums and botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.”  A museum, “museum,” is a place where you can see famo us art.  You could also see some historical information - some historical o bjects - in a museum.  You can have an art museum; you can have a history museum a nd so forth.  Famous museums include, here in Los Angeles, the Getty Mus eum, as well as, in New York, the Metropolitan Museum.  Those are two art m useums.

Botanical gardens, “botanical,” are places where yo u find flowers and trees; usually a very large area that has many different i nteresting plants.  Here in Los Angeles, we have the Huntington Gardens.  These are  botanical gardens that you can go and visit, that have different kinds of plants and trees.

The clerk also recommends that Victor visit the sho pping district.  The expression she uses is “don't miss.”  If someone says to you, “Don't miss this,” they mean you must do this - this is very important - you mus t go here - I strongly recommend that you see or do this thing.  You can s ay, “Don't miss the movie, 'LA Story,' by Steve Martin; it's a very funny movi e.”  That is an example of using that expression - you really should see it, I stron gly recommend it.

The shopping district, “district,” is an area in the city where there are many stores.  Most big cities have several different sho pping districts.  Victor says, “Can I get there on foot?”  The expression on foot is the same as by walking. Can I walk there?  There are a couple of meanings, again, of this expression, on foot; take a look at the Learning Guide for more in formation about those other definitions.

The clerk says no, but he says it in a polite way, he says, “I’m afraid not.”  When you want to say no to someone, but you want to be p olite, this is a good way to do that - “I'm afraid not.”

He says, “You can take a taxi or a bus,” that the c ity has, “a very good bus system.”  The bus, “bus,” system is the system of p ublic transportation in a city that uses buses.  You can have a subway system; you  can have a bus system. Both these are ways of getting around the city.

“The other option,” the clerk says, “is to take a t our.  There are several tour companies that have day tours leaving from this hot el.”  These are companies that come with their own bus and pick you up at you r hotel and take you to the important sights in the city.  A day, “day,” tour is usually a short tour - four, five, maybe eight or nine hours that you go with a group of other tourists, and you

have a person that explains all the different place s you are going, we would call that person a tour guide.

The clerk says, “Help yourself to their brochures.”   He's talking about the brochures or printed information about these tour c ompanies.  The expression, help yourself, means go ahead and take whatever you  want.

Victor then asks if the clerk has a map.  The clerk  does, and gives him one, and Victor thanks him.  He says, “You’ve been a big hel p.”  That's another way of saying you have helped me a lot.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Victor:  Do you have a map showing where those sigh ts are?
