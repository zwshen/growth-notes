This episode is a dialogue between Hanna and Ahmed about playing sports in the wintertime. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hanna: It’s finally snowing outside! Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled.

Ahmed: Sledding is for kids. I’m going downhill ski ing as soon as there’s enough powder. I can’t wait to feel the wind in my hair as  I careen down the side of a mountain.

Hanna: You’re more likely to be on the bunny slopes ! You’ve only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few  times. What makes you think you’ll be able to ski the slopes like an expe rt?

Ahmed: I can ice skate better than you can, so no m atter what, I know I’ll be better at it than you’ll be. When I get the hang of  skiing, I’ll probably try snowboarding.

Hanna: Now I know you’re blowing smoke. You don’t h ave the nerve.

Ahmed: Oh, yeah? I challenge you a game of one-on-o ne ice hockey.

Hanna: You’re twice my size! Make it a snowball fig ht.

Ahmed: You’re on!

Hannah begins by saying, “It's finally snowing outs ide!” “To snow” means for small, soft ice crystals to fall from the sky. I th ink most of you have probably seen snow. It snows in cold places like Minnesota during  the wintertime, which in the northern hemisphere is anywhere between November an d, say, March.

Hanna says, “Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled .” “To get out” here means to remove from where it is stored – to take something out of a place where you have been keeping it until you are ready to use it again. “To get out” can also mean to leave. It's often used as a command, as an order. If you say to someone, “Get out,” you’re telling them to leave. I t's not a very nice way to tell someone to leave, but here we're not talking about leaving, we’re talking about sledding.

A “sled” (sled) is something you use to go down a h ill, usually one that has snow or ice on it. You usually have one, perhaps two peo ple in a sled. The sled is usually flat and allows you to either lie down on t he sled or sit on the sled and then slide down, or move down, a hill that has snow  or ice on it. The word “sled” can also be a verb, “to sled,” which means the acti on of going down a hill with snow or ice on it in something called a “sled.”

Ahmed says, “Sledding is for kids.” He says it's no t something adults do. It’s something children do. He says, “I’m going downhill  skiing as soon as there’s enough powder.” “To ski” (ski) is also related to g oing down a hill with snow and/or ice on it. However, skis are long flat piece s of wood or other material that you put your feet into. You don't lie down or sit d own. You stand when you ski – or at least, you're supposed to stand when you ski.  I know the one time I tried skiing, I didn't stand very much. I spent most of t he afternoon on the ground because I wasn't very good at skiing.

“Downhill skiing” is skiing down a hill or a mounta in. There's another kind of skiing called “cross-country skiing,” which Hanna w ill mention in a second. “Cross- (cross) country (country) skiing (skiing)” is skiing, but not going down a hill – rather, going across flat land, going across  the ground but moving your legs so that you are able to move forward. When you ski downhill, you more or less naturally go forward because it is a hill or a moun tain. In cross-country skiing, you have to really use your legs and arms in order to move yourself forward across the flat ground.

Ahmed is going downhill skiing as soon as there is enough powder. “Powder” (powder) usually refers to snow that has recently f allen on the ground and is still somewhat loose. Apparently, this is better for skii ng. Since I don't downhill ski, I don't know if that's true. But that's what I'm told . Ahmed says, “I can't wait to feel

the wind in my hair as I careen down the side of a mountain.” Ahmed is speaking very eloquently here, almost like he's writing a no vel. “I can't wait to feel the wind in my hair.” That means he can't wait to feel the w ind rushing and blowing through his hair. I guess he's not going to wear a hat.

“To careen” (careen) means to move at a very high s peed toward a specific place, usually going from side to side and slightly  out of control. We often talk about careening in a car or some other vehicle. Ahm ed is talking about careening down the side of a mountain. You have to have some experience in skiing in order to ski down the side of a mountain, because y ou will be going very fast and it would be easy to hurt yourself, or at least easy  to fall down every 10 feet. However, Ahmed says he can do that. He could ski do wn the side of a mountain.

Hanna doesn't believe him. She says, “You're more l ikely to be on the bunny slopes!” “Bunny (bunny) slopes (slopes)” are low hi lls covered with snow, used by people who are just learning how to ski. They wi ll not cause you to go down at a very high speed, and that's why they are used to teach people how to ski. We call those the “bunny slopes.” I think I've been on  a bunny slope once. That was the one time I tried to learn how to ski.

Hanna says, “You've only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few times. What makes you think you'll be able to ski the slopes like an expert?” Hanna says Ahmed has only been on a snowmo bile once. A “snowmobile” (snowmobile) is a vehicle – something you move in that has an engine or a motor in it. It's sort of like a motorc ycle that allows you to go across the snow.

“Cross-country skiing,” we've already explained, is  skiing across flat land using your arms and your legs in a very different way tha n if you go downhill skiing. Hanna doesn't think that Ahmed will be able to “ski  the slopes like an expert” – that is, to ski with a lot of expertise, to ski as though he were someone who was a very good skier. Ahmed says, “I can ice skate bet ter than you can. So no matter what, I know I'll be better at it you'll be.  When I get the hang of skiing, I'll probably try snowboarding.”

Ahmed says he can “ice skate” (skate). “To ice skat e” means to move across a flat piece of ice, wearing special shoes that have what are called “blades” (blades) on them. The blades allow you to move acro ss the ice. In order to play the sport of hockey, for example, you have to use i ce skates. People also use ice skates to perform on the ice in the Olympics. For e xample, you will see ice skating as one of the events. I'm speaking, of cour se, of the Winter Olympics.

Ahmed says because he knows how to ice skate, he wi ll be better at skiing than Hanna. I'm not sure if that's necessarily true, but  that's what Ahmed thinks is true.

He says, “When I get the hang of skiing, I'll proba bly try snowboarding.” “To get the hang (hang) of” something means to learn how to  do something – to learn how to do something well enough so that you can per form it with some competence. You are able to do it pretty well. I ne ver “got the hang of” skiing, at least downhill skiing. I know how to cross-country ski and have cross-country skied many times. I never liked it. It was a lot of  work. I found it much easier just to take a car.

Well, Ahmed says that he, after getting the hang of  skiing, will probably try snowboarding. “To snowboard” (snowboard) is to use a flat, short board to go down a hill of snow or ice, just like you would wit h skis. But skis are two separate pieces of equipment that attach to your feet. A “sn owboard” is one piece of equipment, if you will – one piece of wood, or what ever the material it is made out of – that you put your feet on and use to slide  down a hill with snow on it. A “snowboard” looks sort of like a skateboard, but wi thout the wheels.

Hanna says, “Now I know you're blowing smoke. You d on't have the nerve.” The expression “to blow smoke” (smoke) means very infor mally “to exaggerate” – to say something that isn't true while trying to make yourself appear better than other people. Hanna says, “You don't have the nerve ” (nerve). “To have the nerve” to do something means to have the courage, t o have the strength – especially when we are talking about something that  may be difficult or inappropriate, even. If someone says, “He has a lot  of nerve,” he's not giving a compliment or saying something nice about that pers on. He's saying that that person has done something arrogant or rude that mos t polite people would not do.

Ahmed says, “Oh, yeah? I challenge you to a game of  one-on-one ice hockey.” “To challenge” someone is to say, “I want to compet e with you. I want to play a game with you.” “One-on-one” means there are just t wo people in the game. “Ice hockey” is a sport usually played by two teams of p layers that try to get a small black disc called a “puck” (puck) into a net. It's sort of like soccer, but with sticks and ice skates and a lot of hitting the other playe r. That's hockey. A lot of fighting takes place in ice hockey, at least in the United S tates. I played ice hockey. Yeah, I did. When I was seven.

Hanna says, “You’re twice my size,” meaning you are  twice as big as I am, physically. “Make it a snowball fight.” “Make it” m eans “let's change it” or “let's do this.” Hanna wants to have a snowball fight. A “sno wball” is a round ball of snow,

of course, that you make with your hands, and you t hrow it at other people. This is something that people who live in places where t here is a lot of snow in the wintertime like to do. Certainly, when I was a kid,  we used to have snowball fights all the time, especially with my brothers and siste rs.

Ahmed says, “You're on.” That expression, “You're o n,” is used to show that you agree with and accept what the other person has pro posed, especially if it's a challenge to play a game or to have a contest of so me sort.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

She’s an excellent downhill skier and an amazing ho ckey player – really. I'm speaking of our very own scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse . She's pretty good at scriptwriting, too.
