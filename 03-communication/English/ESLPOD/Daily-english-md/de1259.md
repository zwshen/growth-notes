On this episode, we have a dialogue between Kelly a nd Yoon. It’s about discovering or finding out a secret related to your  family. Sounds interesting. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kelly: [sniffling]

Yoon: What’s the matter? Are you okay?

Kelly: You know that my mother’s funeral was last w eekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and I’ve ha d a shock.

Yoon: What? An old family secret? Some skeleton in the closet?

Kelly: It was for my mother. While reading some of her letters, I found out that she had a son out of wedlock when she was young and  she gave the baby up for adoption.

Yoon: Wow, that’s a bombshell!

Kelly: Yeah, I feel like I’ve been sucker punched. This is life-changing.

Yoon: Maybe you can ask your aunts and uncles about  it.

Kelly: But what if my mother didn’t disclose this to me for a reason? I don’t want to air her dirty laundry now that she’s gone.

 Yoon: You wouldn’t be airing dirty laundry. A part of your family history has come to light and you have questions. That’s natural. An d plus, you’re keeping it in the family.

Kelly: But maybe they’ll feel like I’m dredging up something they wish had been forgotten.

Yoon: Or maybe they’ve been waiting for a chance to  talk about it. You haven’t mentioned the most shocking part.

Kelly: What’s that?

Yoon: You may have a half-brother somewhere out the re.

Kelly: Oh my God, you’re right. That possibility is  both thrilling and terrifying!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kelly “sniffling” (sniffli ng). “To sniffle,” as you heard, is to make a loud sound, usually because you are eithe r crying or perhaps you are sick. You sniffle with your nose when you breathe in air, when the inside of your nose is wet. Yoon asks Kelly, realizing that she is  crying, “What’s the matter?” meaning “What is the problem?” What’s wrong? He say s, “Are you okay?”

Kelly says, “You know that my mother’s funeral was last weekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and  I’ve had a shock.” A “funeral” (funeral) is a ceremony, often a religiou s ceremony, that you have when someone dies. Kelly’s mother died last weekend, and  she brought some of her mother’s papers, some of her documents, home with h er “to sort through,” meaning to look at and determine which ones she wan ts to keep and perhaps which she wants to get rid of.

She had a “shock,” however, when she read through h er mother’s papers. A “shock” (shock) is a big surprise. It could be a go od thing. It could be a bad thing. Here, because Kelly was crying, we know that it was  a bad thing. Yoon says, “What? An old family secret?” A “family secret” is something about your family that you don’t want other people to find out about or perhaps some members of your family don’t want you to find out about. Yoon then says, “Some skeleton in the closet?”

This expression “a skeleton in the closet” refers to a family secret that is embarrassing or perhaps one that is shameful, that you don’t want other people to find out about. Literally, the word “skeleton” ( skeleton) refers to the bones of a human body, usually the bones of someone who is dea d and whose body has, I guess we would say, “decomposed,” or has decayed to  such an extent that all you see are the bones. You don’t see any of the ski n or other parts of the body. A “closet” (closet) is where you keep things. It’s wh ere you, we would say, “store” (store) things such as clothing.

Most houses and apartments have closets where peopl e put their clothing, but imagine if you killed someone and then put his body  in the back of your closet to hide it so no one would find out. Eventually, many years later, someone could look in your closet and they would see a skeleton –  the bones of the person whom you had killed. Well, that would be a very big  family secret, and that’s perhaps where we get this expression from, of “a sk eleton in the closet.” It doesn’t refer to someone you actually kill, however , but anything embarrassing that you don’t want other people to find out about.

Kelly said, “It was for my mother,” meaning the fam ily secret or the shock, I guess, was for her mother. “While reading some of h er letters,” Kelly says, “I found out that she had a son out of wedlock when sh e was young and she gave the baby up for adoption.” The expression “out of w edlock” (wedlock) means that you had a child when you weren’t married or before you got married. “Out of wedlock” means “outside of marriage.” “Wedlock” is an old term for being married. We don’t use it very often anymore.

In fact, this expression is not used very often any more to refer to children who are born to parents who are not married, probably b ecause there are now a high percentage of children, at least in the U.S., who a re born to parents who are not married. So, it is no longer something that people keep secret. It is no longer something that people find embarrassing, and so we no longer use this expression as much as one did, say, when I was grow ing up or earlier.

In any case, her mother “had a son out of wedlock w hen she was young and she gave the baby up for adoption” (adoption). “Adoptio n” is the process of bringing a child into your family as a son or daughter even th ough the child is not biologically related to you – that is, you did not have the child, or you did not participate in the making of the child. Let’s put it that way. We usually talk about someone, a young woman in this case, “giving up the  baby” or “giving the baby up for adoption,” meaning the mother decides not to  keep the child but to have another family raise the child as its own.

Yoon then says, “Wow, that’s a bombshell” (bombshel l). A “bombshell” is some very surprising and shocking news, often a negative  piece of news. The word “bombshell” can also be used to describe a very att ractive looking woman. When I was growing up, people would sometimes use the ph rase about a beautiful actress or model, “a blonde bombshell.” “Blonde” me aning, of course, a light- yellow-colored hair. I don’t think we use the word “bombshell” in that sense as much anymore. Here it has nothing to do with a beau tiful woman; it has to do with a shocking, surprising piece of news.

Kelly says, “Yeah, I feel like I’ve been sucker pun ched. This is life-changing.” “To be punched” (punched) means to be hit with the fist  or a closed hand of another person. The expression “sucker (sucker) punched” re fers to someone hitting you unexpectedly and very hard. Here it refers to a ver y shocking piece of news given to you by someone perhaps as a way of hurting  you, or simply as a very surprising piece of news that has affected you in a  negative way. She says, “This is life-changing,” meaning, of course, it changes h er whole life, or at least she thinks it will.

Yoon says, “Maybe you can ask your aunts and uncles  about it.” Your “aunts” are the sisters of your parents. Your “uncles” are the brothers of your parents. Kelly says, “But what if my mother didn’t disclose this to me for a reason?” “To disclose” (disclose) means to tell someone somethin g that is secret or hidden or confidential, something no one else knows, or at le ast something you don’t know that the person is keeping a secret.

Kelly says, “I don’t want to air her dirty laundry now that she’s gone.” The expression “to air (air) your dirty laundry (laundr y)” means to talk about private or secret information with other people who don’t real ly need to know about it, who perhaps don’t even want to know about it. “Dirty la undry” implies that it’s embarrassing information or information that you wo uld not want other people to hear about.

We use the word “laundry” to talk about clothing th at is dirty or things that need to be washed – or, somewhat oddly, things that have ju st been washed and are clean and have not yet been worn. The verb “to air”  here probably refers literally to put your clothing outside so that it gets dry in  the air, although you might also use the verb “to air” to mean to put out some piece  of clothing or other material that has a smell that you want to get rid of. You m ay put it outside “to air out,” we might say, using the phrasal verb “air out” (out).

Yoon agrees with Kelly that she should not be airin g dirty laundry. “A part of your family history has come to light,” he says, “and yo u have questions.” “Come to

light” means that something that previously had bee n secret now becomes known to people. People find out about some secret information. We could refer to that information as “coming to light.” It was in  the dark before. It was secret before. Yoon says it’s natural, meaning it’s normal , that Kelly doesn’t want to air her mother’s dirty laundry and that she wants to “k eep it in the family,” meaning not let anyone else find out about it outside of he r family.

Kelly then says, “But maybe they’ll feel like I’m d redging up something they wish had been forgotten.” She’s now giving a reason why she should perhaps talk to her aunts and uncles after all. “To dredge (dredge)  up” something means to talk about something that is secret from your past or fr om a long time ago. “To dredge up” can also simply mean to talk about somet hing bad that happened a long time ago that you have forgotten about or that  you don’t want to talk about anymore.

Kelly is worried that she would be “dredging up old  information” with her aunts and uncles that her aunts and uncles don’t want to talk about anymore. Yoon says, “Or maybe they’ve,” meaning her uncles, “have  been waiting for a chance” – or opportunity – “to talk about it.” “You haven’t  mentioned the most shocking part” – that is, Yoon is saying here that Kelly has n’t even talked about an even more surprising piece of news. Kelly says, “What’s that?”

Yoon says, “You may have a half-brother somewhere o ut there.” A “half-brother” is someone that you are related to because you have  the same father or the same mother. So, for example, if a woman gets marri ed and has a son, and her husband dies and she gets married again and has ano ther son, her two sons would be “half-brothers.” They have the same mother  but different fathers.

Kelly says, “Oh my God, you’re right. That possibil ity” – that is, the possibility that her brother is still alive – “is both thrilling and  terrifying!” Something that is “thrilling” (thrilling) is something that is very e xciting in a positive way. Something that is “terrifying” (terrifying) is something that  is scary, something that frightens you, something that causes you to feel fear. Kelly is not sure if she is “thrilled” by meeting a half-brother or “terrified” by the fact that she has one. I’m not sure why she’d be terrified, but she apparently is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
