This episode is a dialogue between Martin and Jina about working at a business illegally, or without paying your taxes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: I’m confused. I’ve been going over the book s and I don’t see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.

Jina: Oh, I have a special arrangement with a few of them. I pay them under the table.

Martin: Are you sure that’s wise? You could get bus ted for tax evasion.

Jina: No one will be the wiser if I pay a few peopl e off the books. All of the people I hire want a job, and a few of them I pay under the minimum wage. Since they don’t have to report their income, they come out ah ead in the end. So what’s the problem?

Martin: I just want to make sure you’re aware of the ramifications. If the government finds out about it, you could be up the creek.

Jina: I’m not worried. Everybody does it.

Martin: If you say so. I’m willing to turn a blind eye, but you’re on your own if you get audited!

Our dialogue begins with Martin saying, “I'm confus ed. I've been going over the books and I don't see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.” The expression “going over the books” refers to looking  at the financial documents of a business, the sort of thing an accountant would d o. The “books” refers here not to a set of books that you would read for pleasure,  but rather a list of all the things that your business has bought and sold, in s uch a way that you can see whether you are making money or not.

Martin is “going over the books” – the financial re cords of the business – but he doesn't see several members of the staff listed in the books. That is, he doesn't see their names and the amount of money that is bei ng paid to them. “Staff” (staff) here just refers to a group of employees. “ To be accounted for” means to be included, to be considered, or sometimes simply to know where someone is or to know information about a certain person. Mart in doesn't have the information about these members of the staff, these  employees, in the financial records of the business.

Jina says, “Oh, I have a special arrangement with a  few of them.” A “special arrangement” would be a special agreement, in this case. She says, “I pay them under the table.” “To pay someone under the table” means not to tell the government about how much you are paying a person. This, of course, is normally considered illegal. It's against the law t o pay an employee without telling the government. Why? Because the government wants i ts money in the form of taxes. You have to pay taxes when you have an emplo yee, which means you have to tell the government that you have an employ ee.

“To pay someone under the table” would mean that yo u're not telling the government. Martin says, “Are you sure that's wise? ” meaning do you really think that's a good idea? “You could get busted for tax e vasion.” “To get busted” (busted) is to get caught by the authorities – or i n this case, by the government – for doing something illegal. If the police arrest y ou for drinking and driving, you would get “busted.” We could say, “You got busted” – you got arrested, you got caught, you got found out. You can also use this in  a school, for example. If a student is doing something wrong and the teacher fi nds out, we could say that student got “busted.” The teacher would punish the student.

In our dialogue, Martin is worried about Jina getti ng busted for tax evasion. “Evasion” (evasion) is avoiding something, not doing something. “Tax evasion” would be not paying your taxes, and the government doesn't like that at all. Jina is not worried, however. She says, “No one will be the wiser if I pay a few people off the books.” The expression “No one will be the wiser” (wiser) means nobody

will know what has happened, and it will remain a s ecret. “No one will be the wiser” means no one will find out.

“Off the books” is similar to “under the table.” Re member, the “books” in this case refers to the financial records of a business. “Off  the books” would be things that are not included in your financial records. Again, this is usually considered illegal, and the government is not happy if it finds out tha t you are not recording all of the business transactions for your business. So unhappy  they could come and make you pay a lot of money or make you spend some time in a government hotel, which is also called a “jail.”

Jina says, “All of the people I hire want a job, an d a few of them I pay under the minimum wage.” The “minimum (minimum) wage (wage)” is the lowest amount, or the minimum amount, that you can pay someone eac h hour for working. The government says you cannot pay someone less than a certain amount every hour. This minimum wage is established by the natio nal, or federal, government. Although individual states often have their own min imum wages, which are sometimes higher than the federal minimum wage, Jin a is paying some of the employees less than the minimum wage, which is defi nitely illegal.

She says, however, that “since they don't have to r eport their income, they come out ahead in the end.” “To report your income” mean s to tell the government how much money you are making. “Income” (income) refers  to the amount of money that you get from working. You have to report your income so the government can determine if you need to pay taxes or not. In t he United States, if you don't make very much money, you still have to report your  income, but the government doesn't make you pay very much in taxes. In fact, i n many cases, it doesn't make you pay any income taxes.

There are other special taxes that you still have t o pay even if you don't make very much money, but the most important, the larges t tax that you pay is typically called your “income tax.” If you don't make very mu ch money, the government may collect the money from you during the year, but  then it will send it back to you after you report your income on what are called  your “tax returns.” But we're getting off our topic a little bit here. Let's go b ack to the dialogue.

Jina says that the employees “don't have to report their income, so they come out ahead.” “To come out ahead” is an expression that m eans to gain some sort of benefit. Specifically, it refers to a situation whe re you are receiving money, but you're also needing to pay someone money for some e xpense that you have. “To come out ahead” would be to bring in more money tha n you have to pay out, so your income, we could say, is greater than your exp enses.

 Another word for this simply is “profit” (profit). If you are making a profit – if you are bringing in more money than you are paying out in your business – you are coming out ahead. The term can be used more general ly to refer to someone who benefits from a certain situation, even if it i sn't financial. Here, it is financial, and Jina says the employees that she is paying off the books come out ahead. “What's the problem?” she asks. Martin says, “I jus t want to make sure that you are aware of the ramifications.” “Ramifications” (r amifications) are the consequences – things that result from a certain ac tion or decision.

Martin says, “If the government finds out about it,  you could be up the creek.” This expression, “to be up the creek” (creek), mean s to be in a very difficult situation, to have a lot of problems. It comes in p art from an expression, “to be up a creek without a paddle” (paddle). A “creek” is a small river. A “paddle” is something that you use. Usually, it's made of wood that is long and is flat and is put in the water to help you move your boat in the water. “To be up a creek without a paddle” is to be in a situation where you  can't get back to where you need to be, and that's why it is used to express th is idea of having problems, having difficulties.

Jina says, “I’m not worried. Everybody does it.” Th is, of course, is what most people use as their excuse for doing something wron g: “Well, everybody does it.” Martin says, “If you say so,” meaning I don't neces sarily believe you, but if you say it's true, then I'm not going to argue with you . “I'm willing to turn a blind eye, but you're on your own if you get audited.” “To tur n a blind eye” means to pretend that you don't see something – to pretend that some thing didn't happen or that you didn't see it happen. “To be blind” (blind) mea ns to be unable to see. “To turn a blind eye” on something means to ignore something , especially something unpleasant or something that perhaps you could get in trouble for.

Martin says to Jina, “You're on your own if you get  audited.” “To be on your own” means to be alone – in this case, it means to have to do something without anyone helping you. Martin is not going to help Jin a if she gets audited. “To audit” (audit) means to examine the financial recor ds of a person or a business to make sure that they are correct. “To audit” means t o make sure that the person or organization is following the law.

To get audited by the government is usually not a g ood thing. It means you have to show that all of your financial records are comp lete. So, you have to be very careful about keeping good financial records for yo ur business.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Martin: I’m confused. I’ve been going over the book s and I don’t see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.
