This episode is a dialogue between Morris and Tony about growing up in difficult situations. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Morris: Congratulations on finishing your latest bo ok. What’s it about?

Toni: It’s about a girl whose parents abandoned her  at birth and who ends up living on the streets. She experiences abuse and is  put in juvie.

Morris: Wow, that sounds heavy. Wasn’t your last bo ok about children whose parents served time in prison and who lived in fear  of bullies in their neighborhood?

Toni: Yes, I wrote that after my first book, which was about a brother and sister who lived in an impoverished home, traumatized by e vents beyond their control.

Morris: Do you ever write about happy childhoods?

Toni: I do write about happy childhoods. All of the  children and teenagers in my books are very resilient. They are survivors.

Morris: I was thinking about children who have normal childhoods with two parents living in the suburbs.

Toni: You call that normal? You think they’d be hap py? I bet there’s an underbelly of crime and misery in most seemingly pe rfect families.

 Morris: I’ve no doubt that if that were true, you’d  be the one to write about it.

Morris says to Tony, “Congratulations on finishing your latest book.” We can guess that Tony is a writer, an author. Morris asks  Tony, “What’s it about?” meaning “What is your book about?” What is the topi c of the book? Tony says, “It’s about a girl whose parents abandoned her at b irth and who ends up living on the streets.” “To abandon someone at birth” is to g ive up your baby right after the baby is born. Usually this expression “to abandon s omeone at birth” refers to, typically, a mother who leaves her child perhaps at  the door of a hospital or somewhere else.

There used to be a term for this called a “foundlin g” (foundling). A “foundling” is a baby who has been abandoned by his or her mother an d who is found – hence the word “foundling” – by someone else who takes ca re of the baby. It was even quite common in some cities in Europe to have found ling hospitals. There’s one in London. There’s one in Florence, Italy, and in s everal other cities. Fortunately, nowadays, we don’t have a lot of foundlings, but th at’s what happens in Tony’s book. A girl is abandoned at birth and ends up livi ng on the streets.

The expression “to live on the streets” means to be  without a home, to not be able to live in any one place but to have to perhap s move around every day. A more common term nowadays is simply “homeless.” “To  live on the streets” implies often that you are involved perhaps in acti vities that aren’t very healthy or safe. Tony says the character, the girl in her nove l, “experiences abuse and is put in juvie.” “Abuse” (abuse) is when someone hurt s you, either physically or emotionally, perhaps even sexually.

This girl eventually “is put in juvie” (juvie). “Ju vie” is another word for “juvenile detention.” Juvenile detention is where you go if y ou are under the age of 18 and commit a crime or do something wrong. You will not go to a regular prison or jail. You will instead typically be sent to a special jai l for children and teenagers called “juvenile detention.” “Juvenile” means that you are  young. You are not an adult. In the United States, you are an adult legally when  you are 18 years of age. The girl in Tony’s novel is eventually placed in juveni le detention – in “juvie.”

Morris says, “Wow, that sounds heavy,” meaning that  sounds very serious. “Wasn’t your last book about children whose parents  served time in prison and who lived in fear of bullies in their neighborhood? ” Tony’s previous book was about parents who “served time in prison.” “To serv e (serve) time in prison”

means to spend time in jail, to be a prisoner. “To live in fear” of something means to always be worried or frightened of something. So me people live in fear of death. They are worried about dying all the time, w hich is not a very good way to enjoy your life.

In Tony’s novel, the children (whose parents are in  prison, remember) live “in fear of bullies.” A “bully” (bully) is a person who is m ean to other people, who uses his strength, power, or influence to hurt other people or to make other people scared. Normally the term “bully” is used to describe a chi ld who intimidates or is mean to another child. More recently, the word has begun to  be applied to adults, although the primary use is still one which is refe rring to a child or a teenager who is mean to another child or teenager.

The characters in Tony’s previous novel “lived in f ear of bullies in their neighborhood” – in the area where they grew up. Ton y says, “Yes, I wrote that after my first book, which was about a brother and sister who lived in an impoverished home, traumatized by events beyond the ir control.” What happy novels Tony writes. The first book she wrote was ab out a brother and sister who lived in an “impoverished home.” “Impoverished” (im poverished) means very poor, without a lot of money. They lived in a house , a poor house, and were “traumatized by events beyond their control.”

“To be traumatized” (traumatized) means to be affec ted by something very bad that happens to you, a very bad experience or perha ps even a bad injury to your body. If you are traumatized by events, something h appens in your life that affects you mentally, emotionally, or psychological ly. Events that are “beyond your control” are things that you are not able to i nfluence or stop. There are many things in our life that are beyond our control – th ings that we can’t stop or influence, like how stupid other people are. There’ s not a lot you can do about that, although I’ve tried.

Morris asks Tony, “Do you ever write about happy ch ildhoods?” “Childhood” refers to the time when you are growing up, between  the time you are born and, say, 18 years old. Tony says, “I do write about hap py childhoods. All the children and teenagers in my books are very resilient.” “Res ilient” (resilient) is an adjective meaning to be able to recover quickly fro m a difficult experience or situation. Someone who is “resilient” is someone wh o, even though he goes through difficult times, is able to recover, is abl e to get better.

Tony describes her characters as being “survivors” (survivors). A “survivor” is someone who remains alive – the word comes from the  verb “to survive” – even when he is in difficult situations. A survivor is s omeone who is able to continue

living even when he may die because of the situatio n he is in – and of course, who can forget that wonderful song by Destiny’s Chi ld, “I’m a Survivor.”

“I’m a survivor, I’m gonna make it I will survive, keep on surviving.”

Great stuff, great stuff. Anyway, we’re talking abo ut survivors in Tony’s depressing novels. Morris says, “I was thinking abo ut children who have normal childhoods with two parents living in the suburbs.”  The “suburbs” are the areas outside of the main city, which in the United State s are often where the richer people live. Tony says, “You call that normal?”

She doesn’t think having two parents and living in the suburbs is normal the way Morris does and the rest of us do. Tony says, “You think they’d be happy?” meaning “Are you saying that the children would be happy with two parents living in the suburbs?” Once again, most of the evidence s ays they are, but not Tony. No. Tony says, “I bet there is an underbelly of cri me and misery in most seemingly perfect families.”

An “underbelly” (underbelly) is something that is h idden normally, something you can’t see that usually involves either crime or som ething bad happening. “Misery” (misery) is suffering – extreme unhappiness – when everything is terrible and sad, like watching an American presidential electio n. It’s misery.

The word “seemingly” (seemingly) means apparently –  something appears a certain way, but it isn’t really. That’s why Tony s ays that she thinks there’s an “underbelly of crime and misery in seemingly perfec t families.” The families look perfect, but in fact they’re not. They’re full of m isery, according to Tony.

Morris says, “I’ve no doubt that if that were true,  you’d be the one to write about it.” Morris is saying that if it were in fact true that there is an underbelly of misery in seemingly perfect families, Tony would be the pe rson who would write stories about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
