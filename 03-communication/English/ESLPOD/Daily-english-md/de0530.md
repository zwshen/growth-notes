This episode is called “Exterior Parts of a Car.”  It’s a dialogue between Ethan and Marie, and it will review a lot of basic vocabular y related to what you find on a car.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ethan:  You missed a spot.

Marie:  Hold on.  When we made our bet for the loser  to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other person being there and being  a pain in the neck.

Ethan:  I’m just here to make sure everything gets washed  properly, from the hood to the taillights.

Marie:  Don’t you worry.  See how carefully I’m washing the windshield, side mirrors, and headlights?  I bet they’ve never been clea ner.

Ethan:  When are you going to get to the tires and the hubcaps?  And I think you forgot the tailpipe.

Marie:  Will you get lost?  I’ll do a better job with out you looking over my shoulder.

Ethan:  I doubt that.  If I weren’t here, who would  remind you to clean the roof rack and the windshield wipers?  I bet you would have fo rgotten those, for sure.

Marie:  I’m going to forget about this whole thing i f you don’t shut up.

 Ethan:  Nah uh.  That’s not an option.  When you lose a bet, you have to pay the price.

Marie:  Well, I’m willing to be a graceful loser if yo u’ll stop gloating.

Ethan:  Not a chance!  Don’t forget the grills!

Our dialogue begins with Ethan saying to Marie, “You missed a spot.”  A “spot” is a small area of something.  In this case, Marie is washing  Ethan’s car, and Ethan is telling her that there is a part of the car that she  didn’t wash properly.  We sometimes use this expression as a joke; when someone is washi ng their car or cleaning something, we may say, “Oh, you missed a spot,” sayi ng that they’re not doing a very good job.  Of course, it’s probably not our  business to be telling them, and certainly that’s the way Marie feels about Eth an!

Marie says, “Hold on (meaning stop).  When we made our bet for the loser to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other pers on being there and being a pain in the neck.”  So Ethan and Marie had made some b et that Marie lost, and so Marie has to wash Ethan’s car.  But, she says, the bet (their agreement over something that if it happened one way would result in Marie winning, if it happened the other way, would result in Ethan winning ) didn’t include the other person being a pain in the neck.  The expression “a pain in the neck” is a person who is very annoying, a person who makes things difficult o r frustrating.  My older brother is a pain in the neck.  I won’t say which older brother; since I have eight, they can guess which one it is!

Ethan says, “I’m just here to make sure everything gets wa shed properly (gets washed correctly), from the hood to the taillights.”  the “hood” is a large, flat piece of metal in the front of the car that, in an Am erican car, covers the engine (the motor).  So the hood is something that is in the  front that lifts up like a door. The “taillights” are two red lights in the back of the  car that indicate when you are going to stop.  The lights turn on when you step on the brake, which slows down or stops your car.

Marie said, “Don’t you worry (meaning don’t worry).  S ee how carefully I’m washing the windshield, side mirrors, and headlights?  I bet they’ve never been cleaner.”  She’s saying that she’s washing the “windshield, ” which is the large window in the front of the car that you look out thr ough; the “side mirrors,” which are the two mirrors, one on each side of the car that allows you to see if someone is behind you or next to you; and the “headligh ts,” which are the two

 lights on the front of the car that help you see at nig ht.  Marie says, “I bet they’ve never been cleaner,” meaning this is the cleanest that th ey have ever been because I am washing them, so Ethan shouldn’t complain.  That’s what she’s saying here.

Ethan says, “When are you going to get to the tires and the hubcaps?”  “When are you going to get to” here means when are you going  to start working on the hubcaps and the tires.  The “tire” is the thick piece of r ubber that goes around the four wheels of your car.  A “hubcap” is a flat, round p iece of metal that covers the side of the tire; it’s used mostly for decoration.  Som e people like to buy very expensive, fancy hubcaps; some people, like me, don’t care.  Then Ethan says, we think jokingly, “And I think you forgot the tailpipe .”  The “tailpipe” is a long, round metal tube that comes out of the back of the car, where the hot gases from the engine go out.  We don’t ever wash the tailpipe.  No one ever sees it for the most part, so most people would never wash the tailpipe.   We think, then, that Ethan here is just trying to make a joke.

Marie then says, “Will you get lost?”  Normally, if you get lost you don’t know where you are.  But if someone tells you to get lost, they’re saying they want you to go away, to leave that person alone.  That’s to get  lost.  It’s a very informal, somewhat rude thing to say to someone.  You would only say it to someone you knew very well, or someone that you didn’t know that you d idn’t care you were being rude to.  It’s not a nice thing to say.  Marie says,  “I’ll do a better job without you looking over my shoulder.”  “To look over (someone’s) shoulder” means to observe very closely what the other person is doing, usually w e use this expression when the other person (the person doing the task – doing the action) doesn’t want you watching them.  So if you are, for ex ample, fixing something, and someone comes and watches you to make sure you do it r ight, and you don’t want them there, you may say, “Stop looking over my shoulde r!”  That’s what Marie is asking Ethan to do.

Ethan says, “I doubt that (I doubt you would do a bette r job if I weren’t here, he means).  If I weren’t here, who would remind you to clean the roof rack and the windshield wipers?”  The “roof” (roof) is the top of the car.  The “roof rack” is something that you put on the top of your car so that yo u can put, for example, suitcases, boxes, skis, things like that on top of your car wit hout damaging your car.  They’re long pieces of metal that protect the roof  (the top of the car), and allow you to put things on top of them.  Most cars still  have roof racks, although because cars have gotten so much larger, I don’t see them being used as much. I guess people put things inside of their car instead.  E than mentions the windshield wipers.  We said the windshield is the window  that you look through in the front of the car.  The “wipers” are the things th at go back and forth that clean

 the water off of the windshield.  There are usually tw o of them in the front of the car, and they have little pieces of rubber on them tha thelp you remove the water from your windshield when, for example, it’s raining.  Ethan says, “I bet you would have forgotten those, for sure.”  “For sure,” he re, means definitely, certainly.

Marie says, “I’m going to forget about this whole thing  if you don’t shut up.” She’s saying I am going to stop washing your car unless you be quiet.  Ethan says, “Nah uh.”  This is a very informal way of saying no, so mething you might hear from a child.  “Nah uh” means not at all, absolu tely not.  Ethan says, “That’s not an option (you don’t have that choice).  When you l ose a bet, you have to pay the price.”  Marie says, “Well, I’m willing to be a gra ceful loser if you’ll stop gloating.”  Someone who is “graceful” is someone who is polite, pleasant, perhaps sophisticated.  In this case, Marie means that she’ ll be a nice loser; she won’t complain if Ethan stops gloating.  “To gloat” (g loat) means to brag, to talk about your good luck or your success, especially around other people who are not successful.  So if you take an exam in school and you ge t a very high score, and no one else got a high score, to gloat would mean to say, “Oh, what a great score I got!  You got a low score?  Oh, that’s too bad.”   That would be to gloat. It’s not a very good thing – nice thing to do.

Ethan, however, says, “Not a chance!” meaning there’s no w ay that he’s going to stop gloating.  Finally he says, “Don’t forget the grill s!”  The “grill” is a vertical or horizontal piece of metal in the front of the car that  protects the engine and the radiator.  So, in the very front of the car – in some  cars anyway, there’s a grill; it’s sort of like a screen that allows air to go into where the engine is.  Not all cars have grills.  Ethan is reminding Marie that she should w ash the grill as well.  The word “grill,” and the word “hood” that we used in th is dialogue, have additional meanings.  Please take a look at our Learning Guide for  some additional explanations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
