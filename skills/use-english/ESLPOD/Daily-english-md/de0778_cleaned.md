This episode is called “Getting Your Pocket Picked, ” it’s when somebody steals something from you, usually your wallet.  Let’s get  started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lenny:  Wait a second.  Where’s my wallet? 

Anita:  It’s not in your back pocket?   

Lenny:  No, it’s in none of my pockets.  My pocket’ s been picked! 

Anita:  It must have happened when our attention wa s diverted by those boys fighting over there.   

Lenny:  I should have been paying more attention in  a busy market like this.  I felt someone bump me from behind, but it never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet. 

Anita:  I’ve been clutching my purse, worried about  purse-snatchers.  I never thought anyone would be able to pick your pocket. 

Lenny:  Me, neither.  I don’t know how I’m going to  live this down.  When the boys hear about this…  

Anita:  Come on, we’d better go file a police repor t.  You never know.  Maybe your wallet will turn up. 

Lenny:  Fat chance of that happening.  This is real ly embarrassing…   

 Anita:  Stop stalling.  If there’s one thing I’ve l earned after being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the music.

Lenny begins by saying, “Wait a second (meaning hol d on; stop).  Where’s my wallet?”  Your “wallet” (wallet) is usually a folde d piece of leather that you use to carry money and credit cards in.  Lenny says, “Wher e’s my wallet?”  He can’t find his wallet.  Anita says, “It’s not in your back poc ket?”  When you’re wearing pants you have usually pockets that you can put things in to, that’s where put my wallet, where most men put their wallets.  Lenny says, “No,  it’s in none of my pockets (meaning I don’t have it in any of my pockets).  My  pocket’s been picked!”  To “pick (pick) (someone’s) pocket (pocket)” means to steal someone’s wallet, usually from their pocket.  And, if you have ever b een on a subway in a large city, or just been in a crowded place where there are lot s of people, especially lots of tourists, you may have had this happen to you, wher e someone takes your wallet from your pocket without you knowing it.   

This happened to me once, many years ago, 20-25 yea rs ago.  I was on a small bus in Mexico, and it was very crowded, which was n ot unusual, and I was very stupid and young, and I had my wallet in my back po cket.  And, it happened so quickly, two people had come on, and one stood in f ront and once stood behind me.  Then they got off the bus and I realized that they had taken my wallet.  So, I learned a lesson there, as you should learn a lesso n; if you haven’t had that happen, make sure you never put your wallet in your  pocket, especially in a busy place.  I keep my wallet in my pocket normally, but  when I ever go to a crowded place, including here in Los Angeles, I’m much more  careful about that. 

Well, Lenny was not careful, and he had his pocket picked.  Anita says, “It must have happened when our attention was diverted by th ose boys fighting over there.”  “To divert” (divert) means to change the d irection of something; in this case, change the direction of your attention, “to d istract you,” we might say.  So, there were two boys fighting, and they were looking  at the boys fighting and weren’t paying attention.  Lenny says, “I should ha ve been paying more attention (I should have been more alert) in a busy market li ke this.”  A “market” is a place where you buy and sell things, where there are ofte n a lot of people.  That’s what Lenny means when he says it’s “busy” (busy), there are a lot of people there. Lenny says, “I felt someone bump me from behind.”  “To bump” (bump) means to hit something, not hard, usually by accident, often  with your body or some part of your body.  What happens, of course, is that the pe ople who pick your pockets – we call them “pickpockets,” that’s the person who d oes this.  Pickpockets will  

often hit you slightly from behind, and that’s when  they actually take the wallet out of your pocket, because you can’t feel them doi ng it while they’re doing it. Anyway, I’m not trying to give you instructions on how to be a pickpocket!   

Well, Lenny says that someone bumped him from behin d.  By the way, “bump” is the word that has other meanings in English as well ; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Lenny says, “it never occurred to  me,” meaning I was surprised that it happened; I wasn’t thinking about it; it ne ver was an idea that I had.  “It never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet.”  So he didn’t realize, when this happened, that someone might be lifting his wallet.  “To lift” (lift) usually means to pick up something heavy in order to carry it or move it off of the ground.  Here, however, “to lift” means to stea l, to rob, especially when you are taking something out of someone’s wallet or som eone’s coat by hitting them or bumping them so they don’t realize you are steal ing it.  You could also use it just as a general verb meaning “to steal” as well. 

Anita says, “I’ve been clutching my purse.”  “To cl utch” (clutch) means to hold something very tightly and very close to your body.   So women, who often carry their wallets in their purses will, if they’re smar t, clutch their purses close to them – hold it close to them, especially on a subway for  example, so that you don’t have someone coming and stealing your purse.  Someo ne who steals purses from women is called a “purse-snatcher.”  A “purse”  (purse) is a small bag, that’s what women often carry.  “To snatch” (snatch) means  to take quickly from someone.  So, a purse-snatcher will often be runnin g down a street, perhaps, and grab a woman’s purse and take it from her – sna tch it from her – and run away.  It could be that the purse-snatcher is on a motorcycle, and comes around and takes the purse and goes away.  I saw that in a  movie recently – a very good movie, Argentinean movie called Nine Queens .  It was very, very entertaining, very interesting.  Anyway, an old movie, 1990 I thi nk.  You can find it on the Internet somewhere perhaps. 

Anita says, “I never thought anyone would be able t o pick your pocket.”  Lenny says, “Me, neither.”  Notice he says, “me, neither, ” not “I, neither.”  “Me” is grammatically incorrect, but that’s how people talk ; they say, “me, neither” in informal conversation.  Lenny says, “I don’t know h ow I’m going to live this down.”  “To live (something) down” is when somethin g bad happens to you or embarrassing happens to you, and everyone makes fun  of you – everyone laughs at you.  You try to keep your pride – your d ignity, you try not to be embarrassed but it’s difficult because of this emba rrassing thing, this thing you did.  That’s what it means to live something down.  Lenny says, “When the boys hear about this,” the boys are probably his friends . 

Anita says, “Come on, we’d better go file a police report.”  “To file” means to officially submit or give a document or piece of pa per usually to a government office.  A “police report” is when you go to a poli ce officer – a cop – and say that there was a crime, and the officer writes up a piec e of paper.  That piece of paper is called a “police report.”  Anita says, “You neve r know.  Maybe your wallet will turn up.”  “To turn up” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means when something is lost it suddenly is found, it suddenly  appears.  “It will turn up” means we will find it eventually, even though it is lost now.  Lenny doesn’t think this is possible; he says, “Fat chance of that happening.”  The phrase “fat (fat) chance” means you don’t think it’s possible; it’s impossibl e.  It’s an informal way of saying that: something is impossible.  “Are you going to w in the lottery?”  “Fat chance,” meaning almost certainly not.  Am I going to win an  award for my singing?  Fat chance.   

Lenny says, “This is really embarrassing.”  Anita s ays, “Stop stalling.”  “To stall” (stall) means to delay in doing something, to avoid  doing something until later. Anita says, “Stop stalling.  If there’s one thing I ’ve learned about being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the mu sic.”  A “cop” is a police officer, as I mentioned earlier.  The expression “to face th e music” means to accept the consequences of your actions, to accept reality.  W hen something bad happens, you can’t just hide from it, you have do accept it,  you have to do something about it or at least to realize that it is happening, not  to avoid it.  Anita and Lenny are married, so when Anita says she’s been a cop’s wife  for 15 years, she means that Lenny is a police officer.  So he was a police  officer who got pick pocketed. This is somewhat embarrassing, that’s why Lenny say s, “When the boys hear about this.”  The “boys,” then, refer to the other police officers – the other cops, male cops – that he works with. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
