This episode is a continuation of the story that w e started in ESL Podcast 455, so if you haven’t listened to 455, “Ending a Bad D ate,” you might want to listen to it to understand this one a little better.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

I really blew it last night.  I finally asked my neighbor , Fatima, out on a date and she walked out on me in the middle of it.   

I didn’t blame her.  I wanted to make a good impressio n on her, but I felt I was floundering a half an hour into the date.  I decided  to liven things up a bit with a few drinks.  I got carried away and got stinking drunk.  W hat an idiot!  I had to call her to apologize. 

Fatima:  Hello. 

Rob:  Uh, hi, Fatima.  This is Rob calling. 

Fatima:  Oh. 

Rob:  Please don’t hang up.  I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night.  I was a real jerk and I’m really, really sorry. 

Fatima:  I appreciate the apology.  Thanks, but I have t o go now. 

Rob:  Hold on one second, please!  I want to explain.  I thought I was boring you at the beginning of the date and that’s why I started in on the drinks.  I’m not normally a lush, really!  I was nervous and worried that things weren’t going well, and I thought a couple of drinks would loosen me up.  

 Fatima:  Okay, I understand that, but that doesn’t excuse  the groping. 

Rob:  Groping?  What groping? 

Fatima:  You don’t remember?  You insisted on a goodn ight kiss. 

Rob:  I did?  It’s all a blur.  I don’t remember anyt hing after you called me a creep.   

Fatima:  You tried to kiss me and I walked out.  Can you  blame me? 

Rob:  No, I can’t.  I deserved much worse.  After that, I can also understand why you’d never want to speak to me again.  Is there any way I can make it up to you?   

Fatima:  I really don’t know… 

Rob:  I promise not to have a drop of alcohol. 

Fatima:  I’ll have to think about it.   

Rob:  And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time. 

Fatima:  Maybe.  Let me sleep on it.   

At least it wasn’t a “no.”  There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance! 

[end of dialogue] 

Our story continues with Rob saying, “I really blew it la st night.”  The expression “I blew it,” or “don’t blow it,” means don’t make a mistake, don’t screw it up.  If you say, “I blew it,” you’re saying I made a mistake, I di d something very poorly, very badly.  Rob says, “I finally asked my neighbor, Fatima, out on a date.”  To “ask someone out on a date” means to ask them to go on a date, often dinner, with you.  Rob asked his neighbor, Fatima, out on a dat e, “and she walked out on me in the middle of it.”  To “walk out on someone” is a phrasal verb meaning to leave someone, usually two people who are together, be cause you are angry or upset at them.  If you are having a meeting and the sal esperson walks out on the rest of you, that means that she was angry and she left t he meeting – she left you because she wasn’t happy. 

 Well, Fatima was not happy about the date, and she wa lked out on Rob in the middle of the date, while they were still eating.  R ob says, “I don’t blame her (I don’t fault her).  I wanted to make a good impression on her,” he says.  To “make a good impression” is to make another person think that y ou are a good person, that you are intelligent, successful, attractive, perhaps h ave a lot money – all the things that I am not!  That’s making a good impression.  Usually you make a good impression the first time you meet someone or the f irst time you are in a certain situation.  Rob felt, however, that he was flou ndering a half an hour into the date.  So, 30 minutes after they started the date,  Rob thought he was floundering.  To “flounder” (flounder) means not to know what to do or say, or to do or say the wrong things.  Someone who is floundering  is not doing very well, making mistakes. 

Rob says he’s decided to liven things up a bit with a few drinks.  To “liven (liven) something up” is a phrasal verb meaning to make something  more exciting or more interesting.  Rob thought he was boring, so he wa nted to liven things up by getting himself a few drinks.  Of course, drinking alcoh ol often changes one’s behavior, sometimes for the worse.  Rob says he got carri ed away and got stinking drunk.  To “get carried away” at doing somethin g means to do too much of something, so much so that it becomes a bad thing, ta king something to the extreme.  Everything in moderation, as the Greeks said.  T hat is, don’t have too much or too little of anything.  Rob clearly had too mu ch to drink. 

He says, “What an idiot!” talking about himself.  “I had  to call her to apologize,” and then we hear a phone conversation between Rob and Fatima.  Fatima answers by saying, “Hello.”  Rob says, “Uh, hi, Fatima.  T his is Rob calling.” Fatima says, “Oh.”  Clearly, Fatima is not too excited to  talk to Rob – because, of course, he was an idiot!  Rob says, “Please don’t hang up .”  To “hang up” means to put part of the telephone back into the holder and  end a call.  More generally, it means simply to end a telephone call.  “Hang” has several  different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations. 

Rob is asking Fatima to continue talking to him.  He says, “I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night.”  “Atrocious” (atrocious) means very bad, awful, terrible, something that’s really bad – it’s atrocious.   “I went to a restaurant yesterday and ordered some lasagna, and it was atrocious” – it was terrible. Really, it was!  Well, Rob had atrocious behavior.  He says he was a real “jerk,” a real idiot, and he’s really, really sorry.  Of course, whe n men make mistakes, they have to say they’re really, really, really, really, really, really sorry – and that’s what Rob is doing! 

 Fatima says, “I appreciate the apology.  Thanks, but I h ave to go now,” meaning I don’t want to talk to you anymore – you idiot!  Rob sa ys, “Hold on one second, please!”  The expression “hold on one second,” or “hold o n a second,” or simply “hold on,” means that you are asking someone to wait, to  stop, not to do something, at least for short period of time.  Often w e say this when the person is trying to walk away or end a conversation.  We can also u se this expression when a person is getting angry or starting to say things that aren’t true, and you want them to listen to you now.   

Rob is trying to get Fatima to continue talking to him.   He says, “Hold on one second, please!  I want to explain.”  He says he thought he was boring Fatima at the beginning of the date and that’s why he started in  on the drinks.  To “start in on” something means to begin to do something, to begi n to use something.  You may tell your daughter “It’s time for you to start in o n your homework,” meaning get going, start doing your homework you lazy daughter!   Rob says that he’s normally not a lush (lush).  A “lush” is a person who dri nks too much alcohol, a person who can’t control his or her drinking.  Rob says tha t he was nervous and he thought a couple of drinks would loosen him up.  To “loosen up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make someone more relaxed, more friendly; more sociable, we might say.  If someone says to you, “Loosen up! ” they mean relax, don’t be so nervous.   

Rob was trying to loosen up.  Fatima says, “Okay, I understa nd that, but that doesn’t excuse the groping.”  To “excuse” means to give a r eason why something happened.  Usually, when someone says, “that doe sn’t excuse this,” they mean that is not a sufficient reason – a good reaso n.  “Groping” is when you touch someone, usually with some sort of sexual intent.  I f you are a man in a subway and there’s a beautiful girl standing next to you – woman, if you try to touch her in some sexual way that would be considered gro ping.  That would also make you a creep – see podcast number 455 for a def inition! 

Well, Fatima says that Rob was groping her.  Rob doesn’ t understand, Rob doesn’t remember this.  He says, “It’s all a blur.”  “Blu r” (blur) is something that is unclear, something that is difficult to see or understan d.  Rob doesn’t remember it.  Fatima explains that Rob tried to kiss her, and says, “Can you blame me (for walking out – can you blame me for leaving)?”  Rob says, “No, I can’t.  I deserved much worse” – I should have gotten something worse , perhaps a slap on the face!  Rob says, “I can also understand why you’d  never want to speak to me again.”  But Rob is trying to find a way to get ano ther date with Fatima, so he says, “Is there any way I can make it up to you?”  To “make it up to” someone means to do something nice for someone as an apology for something bad that you had done earlier.    

 Fatima says, “I really don’t know…”  Rob says, “I promise n ot to have a drop of alcohol.”  A “drop” is a very small amount of something,  usually a liquid.  So, he’s saying I’m not going to drink any alcohol – except maybe a beer or two, but other than that, nothing!  Fatima says, “I’ll have to think a bout it.  Rob says, “And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time .”  To have your hands behind your back means, of course, you cannot do any groping  or something inappropriate.  Fatima says, “Maybe.  Let me sleep on it .”  When someone tells you they want to “sleep on” something, they mean they wan t a chance to think about it more, at least one more day and see what the y decide, to give them more time to make a decision. 

Rob says, “At least it wasn’t a ‘no.’  There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance!”  “Glimmer” is a very quick or short sight of someth ing.  Here, it means there’s a possibility that Fatima will go out on anothe r date with him.  A “glimmer of hope” means a small amount of hope, but still it’s possible. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
