This episode is a dialog between Matilda and Cesar regarding going on a trip and making some videos. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don ’t leave right now.

Matilda:  I’m just getting some footage of this are a before we leave. “This area is known for its...”

Cesar:  Now what are you doing?

Matilda:  I’m doing a voice-over for this segment. Voice-overs are very important in good travel videos.

Cesar:  You can add the voice-over when you edit it . Let’s go!

Matilda:  Just give me five more minutes. Hmm, this  footage is turning out to be too shaky. Hold on while I set up the tripod.

Cesar:  We don’t have time for that. Grab your camc order, and let’s go.

Matilda:  Too much motion will ruin any travel vide o. Wait! I want to get a close- up of that building and a wide-angle shot of this e ntire area. Hey, where are you going with my gear?

Cesar:  I, and your gear, are going to the tour bus . I’m not going to get left behind – again!

[end of dialogue]

Cesar begins our dialogue by saying to Matilda, “Hu rry up!” “Hurry up” means go faster, you’re moving too slowly. “Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don’t leave right now.” “We’ll miss” means we won’t be ab le to get on the tour bus because it will leave without us. A “tour bus” is a  large bus that carries many people, sometimes twenty, thirty, or more people. A nd it takes you on some sort of tour. So, you go around and you learn about diff erent things or perhaps, you go from one city to the next and the other people o n the bus are on the same tour as you are. They’re going on vacation and are going  to the same place as you’re going to. You can have a tour bus within a city tha t just gives you information about the most important places in the city – it ta kes you to those places. You could also have a tour bus that goes in between cit ies that travels around the country even.

Cesar is worried about missing the tour bus. He say s, “We’ll miss it if we don’t leave right now” – immediately. Matilda, who’s obvi ously a little slow, says, “I’m just getting some footage of this area before we le ave.” “Footage” (footage) is, in this case, a video recording. It used to be, of cou rse, that when you recorded things like a motion picture, you would have some t ape – physical tape – that would go around inside the machine and it would rec ord it on that – that is, the video would be recorded on this little piece of tap e that would go around inside. And if you took the tape and unwound it, you could actually measure how many feet the tape was. Probably that’s the origin of the word “footage” but nowadays, of course, we don’t have actual physical film, at l east in most cameras that a regular consumer or regular person would use. But w e still sometimes use this word “footage” to refer to an amount of video recor ding. I think it’s becoming less common nowadays.

Matilda says she’s getting some footage, she’s reco rding some video of this area, where they are right now, before they leave. She says, “This is area is known for its...” – she starts narrating the video,  she starts talking into the camera. Cesar says, “Now, what are you doing?” Mati lda says, “I’m doing a voice-over for this segment.” A “voice-over” is whe n you have a video and you hear someone’s voice who’s not actually in the vide o – at least you can’t see the person – so a voice over would be any kind of recor ding that you would hear while watching a video of something else. Matilda s ays she’s doing a voice-over for this segment. A “segment” (segment) is a sectio n or a part of a video, a film, a television show, a podcast, an audio show – any par t or section of that, a smaller part of it would be called the “segment.” So, Matil da is using all of this vocabulary that would probably be more likely used by a profes sional filmmaker. Matilda says voice-overs are very important in “good travel  videos.” “Travel videos” would be videos that show different popular tourist areas . It is something you would take when you go on a trip. If you go to Paris or y ou go to Bangkok or you go to

Tokyo, you could take videos of those areas and you  would show them to your friends or to other people to show them what you ca n see there – that’s a travel video.

Cesar says, “You can add the voice-over when you ed it it. Let’s go.” “To edit” (edit) means to change something, usually an audio,  or a video, to make it better, to get rid of the parts that you don’t want. We als o use this verb in talking about writing – you can edit someone’s writing. You can g o through and correct the grammar, change sentences around, correct the punct uation – all that might be part of editing. Cesar says, “You can add the voice -over – to the video – when you edit it. Let’s go.” Matilda says, “Just give me  five more minutes. Hmm, this footage is turning out to be too shaky.” The sound that she makes “hmm” is one you would make when you are maybe thinking of somet hing, maybe you saw something you didn’t like, or you were not certain about something – “hmm.” Usually it’s spelled “hmm”. Matilda says, “Hmm, thi s footage is turning out to be – is resulting – in something that is too shaky (shak y).” Something that is “shaky” has a lot of small movements. So, if you are taking  a video with a camera or your phone and you move it around a lot, when you watch it, it will look like you are moving the camera around and that would be “shaky” – it’s hard to watch.

Matilda says, “Hold on,” meaning wait, “while I set  up the tripod.” A tripod (tripod) is not related to a podcast. A “tripod” is a device  usually made out of metal that has three legs – that’s where you get the “tri-” (t ri) meaning three. The “tripod” is used to put a camera on so that the camera remains steady – that is to say, it doesn’t shake. So, you put a camera on a tripod and  you can use that for taking pictures. It could be a video camera. It could be a  regular camera that you would take photographs with – a “still” camera, I guess w e could call it. Cesar says, “We don’t have time for that. Grab your camcorder and l et’s go.” A “camcorder” (camcorder) is a camera that records video. It’s an other word for a video camera – a “camcorder,” coming from the words “camera” and  “recorder.”

Matilda says, “Too much motion will ruin any travel  video.” Cesar is trying to get Matilda on the tour bus so that they can leave but Matilda is spending her time talking about her video. She says, “Too much motion  (motion),” meaning too much movement, “will ruin any travel video.” “To ru in” (ruin) means to make something worthless, to destroy, to make it so that  you can’t use it anymore. Matilda is saying that if you have too much motion,  if you have too much movement, if it’s too shaky then the travel video w ill be ruined – you can’t use it, really. “Motion,’ I should mention, has a couple of  other meanings in English. Take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Matilda continues, “Wait. I want to get a close-up of that building and a wide- angle shot of this entire area.” A “close-up” (clos e-up) is an image of something where the camera is very close to it. It’s right ne xt to the object. It could be someone’s face or it could be a thing. Matilda want s a “close-up” of a building she sees and a “wide-angle (angle) shot” of this en tire area. A “wide-angle shot” is a photograph or a video that’s made with a speci al lens – a special thing you put on the front of the camera to show a very wide area so you’re able to see more than you could with a regular camera lens.

Matilda says, “Hey, where are you going with my gea r?” “Gear” (gear) here just means my equipment. Cesar says, “I and your gear are going to the tour bus.” So, Cesar is taking her camera and her things and w alking toward the tour bus. He says, “I’m not going to get left behind again.” “To be left behind” means not to be taken with the rest of the group of people – oft en because you’re too late or you’re too slow. If a bus is going to leave at 8 o’ clock and you come at 8:15, you will be “left behind” – you will have to stay where  you are because you missed the bus. And that’s what Cesar is trying to prevent .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don ’t leave right now.

Matilda:  I’m just getting some footage of this are a before we leave. “This area is known for its...”

Cesar:  Now what are you doing?

Matilda:  I’m doing a voice-over for this segment. Voice-overs are very important in good travel videos.

Cesar:  You can add the voice-over when you edit it . Let’s go!

Matilda:  Just give me five more minutes. Hmm, this  footage is turning out to be too shaky. Hold on while I set up the tripod.

Cesar:  We don’t have time for that. Grab your camc order, and let’s go.

Matilda:  Too much motion will ruin any travel vide o. Wait! I want to get a close- up of that building and a wide-angle shot of this e ntire area. Hey, where are you going with my gear?

 Cesar:  I, and your gear, are going to the tour bus . I’m not going to get left behind – again!
