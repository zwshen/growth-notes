# Tough Negotiations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 19: Tough Negotiations. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 19. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

In this episode, we’ll try to negotiate or arrange a good deal or bargain. It’s a story about my experiences renting an apartment her e in Los Angeles.  Let’s get started! > I'm not what you would call the world's best negoti ator, but sometimes it's necessary to engage in a tough negotiation. Take, f or instance, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment. This was back i n college, when I was renting a small studio in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. When my lease was up, the landlord and I sat down to hammer  out the terms of a new lease.  
> "I'll tell you what I'm going to do," he said. "I'm  going to give you a break on rent if you sign a two-year lease instead of just a one-yea r lease."  
> "Well," I said, "I don't know. What sort of break a re we talking about here?"  
> "I'll give you a 5% rent increase instead of a 10% increase in exchange for you signing a two-year lease. It's a win-win situation:  you get a cut in rent, and I get the security of a two-year lease."  
> At this point, I decided to make a counter-proposal . "How about this," I said, "You give me a one year lease with a six percent increas e."  
> "No, I can't make that sort of deal," he said. "But  here's what I can do, and it's my final offer: I'll pay for your electricity for t he first 6 months of the lease, along with the other terms I mentioned before."  
> "You drive a hard bargain. Okay, it's a deal," I sa id. I guess I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more, but I was happy with o ur agreement. Now all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. 
> Today we’re talking about negotiations. Negotiation s are when you have to try to reach an agreement on something with someone, eithe r in business or in your personal life.  Tough negotiations are difficult ne gotiations, negotiations that require a lot of effort or work. 

I started by saying that “I’m not what you would ca ll the world’s best negotiator.” Someone who negotiates is called a “negotiator” (ne gotiator).The phrase, “I’m not what you would call,” means “No one thinks that  I am very good at this” or “I would not be called by someone else (this thing).” We often use it as a way to be humble, to not brag or boast about yourself. So, wh en I say “I’m not what you would call the world’s best negotiator,” I’m saying  I’m not very good at negotiating.  

When you use this phrase about someone else, it is a criticism. If someone is a very bad singer, you could say, “He’s not what you would call the world’s best singer.” People say that about me all the time. 

I said in the story that “sometime it’s necessary t o engage” – to take part – “in a tough negotiation.”  Then I said, “Take, for instan ce, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment.” Take, for instance means si mply “For example” or “As an example.” “The time I had to” here means “When I  had to.” 

I said I had to “renew the lease on my apartment. “ To renew some agreement or contract” means to extend it, to make it go longer.  So, when you have an agreement and you renew it, you’re committing to a longer period of time. You are promising to do what the contract says for a lo nger time.  

I say that I’m trying to renew my lease. A “lease” (lease) is a rental agreement, a contract between two people where one person owns s omething and the other person pays to use it. A lease is a contract to ren t an apartment or some other building. You can also use the term “lease” for a c ar. If you’re leasing a car, you’re just paying rent on the car. You are using s omeone else’s car by paying them money. 

For an apartment in the United States, typically yo u sign or agree to a one-year lease.  After one year, you can usually renew your lease. 

I said that the tough negotiations that I was part of were back in college. We use that expression “back in” to mean “when I was” or “ at the time of.” For example,  

you could say, “Back in the 1920s, people liked to dance to jazz music.” That means that in the 1920s, people enjoyed dancing to jazz music. 

I said “I was renting a small studio in the Miracle  Mile area of Los Angeles.” A “studio” apartment is a one-room apartment. Everyth ing is in one room: your bedroom, your bed, your kitchen, your clothes. You just have one room. If you have a separate room for the bedroom, that would be  called a “one-bedroom” apartment. But this was just a studio apartment. Th e “Miracle Mile area” is just a part of Los Angeles, in the middle of the city of L os Angeles. 

I said that my lease was up. When a lease is coming  to an end, we can use the expression “was up” or “is up.” We also use that wi th the word “time.” “Time is up” means there’s no more time or the time is over,  the time is finished. If you have students who are taking an exam and the teache r says, “Time is up!” she means, “Stop working on your exam, the time is over .”  

In the story, my lease was up, so the landlord and I sat down to hammer out the terms of a new lease. A “landlord” (landlord) is so meone who owns a building and rents part of the building to someone else. I s aid I was sitting down or meeting with my landlord “to hammer out the terms o f a new lease.” “To hammer out something” or “to hammer something out” means t o negotiate, to figure out, to come to a solution. “Terms” (terms) in a negotia tion are the specific points that you are negotiating about. So, for a lease on an ap artment, the terms would be how long the lease is, how much you pay for rent, w hether you pay for gas, electricity, and water, and so forth.  

I then used a couple of expressions that are very c ommon in negotiations, whether it’s a personal or business negotiation. On e of them was, “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.” This is an expression that w e would use before we give someone our proposal, our ideas for an agreement we  are negotiating. The idea here is that we are going to give the person a good  deal, a bargain, perhaps a low price.  

I said that the landlord told me he would give me a  break on rent. A “break” (break) here means a reduction, when you make somet hing less. The expression is “a break on  something.” “I’m going to give you a break on the price of a new car” means “I’m going to reduce or lower the price for you.” The landlord said he would give me a break on rent if I signed or agreed  to a two-year lease instead of just a one year lease. 

I responded to the first proposal by my landlord by  saying, “What sort of break are we talking about here?” The expression, “What s ort of (something) are we  

talking about?” means “What exactly are the details ?” For example, my friend wants to go on a trip, and he wants to go camping i n a tent out in the middle of the desert. So I say, “Well, what kind of tent are we talking about here?” meaning “Give me more information about it.” By the way, I would never go tenting or camping in the desert. In fact, I’d never go tentin g anywhere. I’m not a camper.  

Anyway, back to – let’s return to – our story: I sa id that the landlord proposed only increasing my rent 5% instead of, or in place of 10% in exchange for signing a two-year lease. “In exchange for” is a common neg otiating term. It means: You give me something, I give you something. We exchang e or give each other something of value.  

My landlord says this is a “win-win situation.” “Wi n-win” means “You win and  I win” – we both benefit or gain something from the n egotiation. The landlord said I would get a cut in rent. A “cut in rent” is the sam e as a “break on the rent,” a reduction in the rent. 

Now, I wasn’t happy with the landlord’s first propo sal, so I made a counterproposal. A “counterproposal” means after so meone proposes or give his ideas, you reply with or give your own ideas. We ev en use that word “counter” as a verb: “He countered my proposal with another prop osal.” Instead of counterproposal you can also say “counteroffer.”  

I introduced it by saying, “How about this?” and th en I gave him my idea. That expression “How about this?” is used before we are about to give someone our views or ideas about how the contract or the negoti ation should be. You can use this expression when you’re trying to come to an ag reement with someone about what to do about any situation. For example, you co uld say, “You want to go to the movies. I want to go to the beach. How about th is? We go to the movies first, and then the beach.” That is how we use “How about this?”  

I said, “How about this?” and then gave my counterp roposal: “You give me a one-year lease with a six percent increase.” He res ponded by saying, “No, I can’t make that sort of deal.” A deal is an agreement.  

He then said to me, “But here’s what I can do, and it’s my final offer.” There are two expressions here: “Here’s what I can do” and “f inal offer.” “Here’s what I can do” is what you would say in a negotiation when you  are not agreeing completely with the other person, but you’re willing to compro mise in the negotiation. To compromise means you give up something and the othe r person gives up something.  

The other term my landlord used was final offer. Wh en someone says, “It’s my final offer,” they mean “That’s all I’m willing to do or to give.” The person is not going to compromise anymore.  

My landlord’s final offer was that he would pay for  my electricity – my electrical bill – for the first six months of the lease, “alon g with,” or in addition to, the other terms he already mentioned. 

I ended by saying to my landlord, “You drive a hard  bargain.” A “hard bargain” is a difficult bargain or difficult agreement. The exp ression “to drive a hard bargain” means that the other person is a very tough negotia tor, that the negotiations are very difficult. I then say, “It’s a deal,” meaning “I agree to your terms.” I accept your proposal. 

I say that “I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more.” “To bargain someone down” means to get them to reduce their pri ce or to compromise more. I did not try to bargain my landlord down because I  was happy with or satisfied with the agreement. 

After I agreed to my landlord’s terms, I said that “All I had to do was sign on the dotted line.”  “All I had to do” means “The only th ing I had to do.” The “dotted line” in a contract, is where you put your signature indi cating you agree to the contract. This is a common expression in English, “ to sign on the dotted line.” It means you are going to sign a contract agreeing to something. 

Now let’s listen to our story this time at a normal  speed.
