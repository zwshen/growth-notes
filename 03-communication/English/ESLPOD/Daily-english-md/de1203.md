[start of dialogue]

John: I’m glad to see you’re back and looking so he althy.

Lindsay: Thanks. Rehab wasn’t easy, but getting tre atment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit rock bottom.

John: Recovery from substance abuse isn’t easy, but  I’m happy you got the help you needed.

Lindsay: I’m glad I checked into an inpatient progr am. I was able to detox, and I’m now getting the medication and counseling I nee d.

John: I thought you were done.

Lindsay: No, I’m now in their outpatient program, w ith a plan for staying sober so I won’t relapse.

John: And you’re staying away from temptation?

John: Uh, is that wise?

Lindsay: It will be a good test of my self-control.

John: That doesn’t sound . . .

Lindsay: [sound of a car horn] Sorry, there’s my ri de. We’re checking out a new club tonight.

John: Yikes.

John begins our dialogue by saying to Lindsay, “I’m  glad to see you’re back and looking so healthy.” Lindsay says, “Thanks. Rehab w asn’t easy, but getting treatment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit r ock bottom.” “Rehab” (rehab) is short for “rehabilitation” (rehabilitation). And “r ehab” or “rehabilitation” is a program that you go through when you have a problem , usually related to some sort of “addiction” (addiction).

An “addiction” is when you do something or use some thing so much that you lose control of other parts of your life. You may, for e xample, be addicted to alcohol, where you drink alcohol so much that you are unable  to have a job or have a family. Some people try to stop having these addict ions by going to a special program called “rehab.” Often, these are programs that are located in other places. You actually go and stay in a separate buil ding or house. Lindsay has gone to rehab and she got treatment for her addicti on.

“Treatment” is medical care that a doctor gives a p atient, but it could also be care given by a psychologist or other counselor to help someone, in this case, break or get rid of one’s addiction to a certain drug or a certain behavior. You can be addicted to certain behaviors just as you can be ad dicted to certain physical substances such as alcohol or drugs. Some people are addicted to “gambling” – to going out and spending money on cards and other games to try to win more money. Notice the use of the preposition “to” –  yo u are “addicted to” something.

Lindsay says the treatment for her addiction saved her life, meaning if she had not gotten the treatment, she might have died. She says, “I’d hit rock bottom.” “Rock bottom” is the lowest, worst point in your li fe or in the particular addiction that you have. “To hit rock bottom” is to be the wo rst you could possibly be. Some people say that people who have addictions nee d to hit rock bottom. They need to be at their lowest point before they can ge t better.

 John says, “Recovery from substance abuse isn’t eas y, but I’m happy you got the help you needed.” “Recovery” (recovery) is getting better from some illness or some disease or some medical problem. We also use t his word “recovery” when we’re talking about the economy getting better afte r it has been in a very bad state or poor condition. Here, we’re talking about a person getting better – in this case, recovering from “substance (substance) abuse (abuse).” “Substance abuse” is when you use drugs or alcohol in such a w ay that you become addicted to them.

John says, “Recovery from substance abuse isn’t eas y, but I’m happy you got the help you needed.” Lindsay says, “I’m glad I checked  into an inpatient program.” “Inpatient” (inpatient) refers to a situation where  you go and you stay at a hospital or a clinic for a long time, or at least overnight.  In the hospital, we talk about people who are getting “inpatient treatment” and “o utpatient treatment.” “Outpatient treatment” is when you go to a hospital  or a clinic but then you go home at the end of the day. You don’t stay there.

Lindsay went into an “inpatient recovery program” w here she went and actually slept there, stayed there for a certain period of t ime. Maybe it was a week or perhaps a month. Lindsay says she was able to “deto x” (detox). “To detox” means to go through the process where the chemicals  in your body from the alcohol or the drugs are able to leave your body an d therefore no longer affect you physically.

Some people use the same term when they are trying to get rid of what they consider bad chemicals from the food they eat. But here, we’re talking about someone who has been abusing drugs or alcohol. “Det oxing” means to wait until those chemicals are out of your body, or at least t hat’s the general idea. She says, “I’m now getting the medication” – that is, o ther drugs – “and counseling I need.” “Counseling” is professional guidance from s omeone who is trained to help you with this particular psychological problem  or this particular addiction.

John says, “I thought you were done,” meaning I tho ught you were finished. I thought you didn’t have to go to any more programs.  Lindsay says, “No, I’m in their outpatient program.” We just defined “outpati ent” (outpatient) a few seconds ago. It’s when you go and get medical treatment but  you don’t stay at the clinic or hospital. You go back to your own house at the end of the day.

Lindsay says that she’s in an outpatient program, “ with a plan for staying sober so I won’t relapse.” “To be sober” (sober) is to no t be drunk. “To be sober” is the opposite of being drunk or being under the influenc e of drugs or alcohol. Lindsay

doesn’t want to “relapse” (relapse). “To relapse” m eans to go back to your former poor condition.

If you have cancer, for example, and you get rid of  the cancer for a certain amount of time and you’re feeling better, but then the cancer comes back, we would call that a “relapse” of the cancer. The canc er returned. People who go through drug rehabilitation programs sometimes get better – they feel better – but then they “relapse.” They go back to being addicted  to the chemical, the drug or alcohol, to which they were addicted before.

John says, “And you’re staying away from temptation ?” “Temptation” (temptation) is something that makes you want to do something or  want to have something that perhaps you shouldn’t do or have. If you are t rying to lose weight and you have a big piece of chocolate cake sitting in front  of you, that chocolate cake is a “temptation.” It is something that makes you want to eat the cake in this case and do something you shouldn’t do – at least, if you wa nt to lose weight.

Temptations for a drug addict would be situations in which they could use drugs again. You want to stay away from those situations.  This is common sense or used to be common sense. Everyone used to know that  if you don’t want to do something, you should avoid situations where those things are present or there are temptations to do those things.

Lindsay says she’s staying away from temptations – situations that might cause her to want to drink or take drugs again. She says,  “I’m only going clubbing two nights a week, instead of every night.” “To go club bing” (clubbing) means to go to bars or nightclubs where people drink and dance. So metimes we just use the verb “to club” instead of “to go clubbing.” Here in  Los Angeles, there are lots of young men and women who go clubbing up in Hollywood , which is a neighborhood in Los Angeles where there are lots of  bars and clubs – dance clubs.

When I was a younger man, I went to some clubs here  in Los Angeles, but I was never very good at dancing so clubbing wasn’t a goo d place for me. Besides, none of the good-looking women wanted to dance with  me anyway. Lindsay says she’s going clubbing two nights a week. John doesn’ t think that’s a good idea. He says, “Uh, is that wise?” “Wise” (wise) means intel ligent. Is that a good idea?

Lindsay says, “It will be a good test of my self-co ntrol.” “Self-control” is your ability to control your thoughts, words, and action s, especially when you are in a difficult or tempting situation. If you are sitting  with your girlfriend or your wife and another beautiful woman walks by you, you must have  “self-control.” You don’t

want to be looking at another woman, especially whe n you are with your own beautiful woman. That is an example of “self-contro l,” gentlemen.

Lindsay thinks that going to a club where there are  other people drinking will be a good test of her self-control. She’ll be able to se e whether she can really resist drinking again. John begins by saying, “That doesn’ t sound . . .” He’s trying to say, “That doesn’t sound like a good idea.” But the n we hear the sound of a car “horn” – that part of the car that makes a very lou d noise to warn other drivers of something. Lindsay says, “Sorry, there’s my ride,” meaning there is the person who I am going to go with tonight, someone who is g oing to drive me somewhere.

She says, “We’re checking out a new club tonight.” “To check out” means to investigate or to go to for the first time to see i f it’s any good. John ends our dialogue by saying, “Yikes” (yikes). “Yikes” is a w ord we use to express our surprise, usually at something bad. Sometimes we say “yikes” to be funny, but it is normally used to express your surprise or shock at something. John is surprised that Lindsay is going to this new club. H e doesn’t think it’s a very good idea. It will be too much of a temptation for her w ith all that alcohol around her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
