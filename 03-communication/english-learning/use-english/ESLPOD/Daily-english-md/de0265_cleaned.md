# Listening to the Radio

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 265: Listening to the Radio.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 265.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.   Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com, and download a Learning Guide for this episode.  In this episode, we're going to listen to a dialogue between two students, I think, college students, who are talking about “Listening to the Radio.”  Let's get started.  > Kurt:  Turn that radio down!      Gloria:  No way!  I’m listening to a simulcast of a performance and it’s live.    Kurt:  Is it on campus radio?  Gloria:  No, it’s on the public radio station.  I finally got good reception after putting this long antenna outside my window and I’m not turning it off now.  Kurt:  You are so low-tech.  I can’t believe you’re still listening to AM/FM radio.  You should get satellite radio.  You get shows in hundreds of formats, and there are a lot of stations without DJs.  And there’s never any static!  Gloria:  I like listening to the regular broadcast radio.  I don’t have to pay for it and I’m happy with the stations we have in this city.  You’re just a technology snob.  If it’s high-tech, you love it and have to have it.  Kurt:  It’s true that I know quality when I see it, and I don’t settle for less.  What’s wrong with that?  Gloria:  Nothing, but I don’t have to jump on the bandwagon.  Now, be quiet.  I’m trying to listen.  Kurt:  Fine.  This is the thanks I get for trying to give you a little good advice.
