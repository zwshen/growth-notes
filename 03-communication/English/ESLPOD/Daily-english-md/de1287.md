# Using Adapters and Converters

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,287 – Using Adapters and Converters.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,287. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Ben and Nicola a bout being able to plug in or use your electronic devices when you’re in another country or when you’re traveling. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ben: Wait! Don’t plug that into the socket. You’ll fry that old hair dryer.

Nicola: I can’t, anyway. This plug has two prongs a nd that socket is designed for three prongs.

Ben: That’s why I brought these adapters and this c ombination converter and transformer. Our devices will either not work or be  ruined if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.

Nicola: I should have bought a travel hair dryer wi th dual voltage.

Ben: You’d still need an adapter.

Nicola: Whatever. Okay, I’ve put them both on. Now can I dry my hair?

Ben: You can’t use that hair dryer because the cord  is frayed. If you turn it on, it may short circuit and then blow a fuse. We’d be wit hout electricity.

Nicola: What am I supposed to do then?

Ben: Good thing I brought mine. Let me just check t hat the outlet is grounded. Yeah, I think it’s safe for you to use this one.

Nicola: I won’t get electrocuted?

Ben: You won’t even get a little singed.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ben saying to Nicola, “Wai t,” meaning “Stop what you are doing.” He then says, “Don’t plug that into the  socket.” The phrasal verb “to plug (plug) in” something or “to plug something in”  – and we can also use “into” (into) with this verb – means to put the wire that is connected to an electronic device into what is called a “socket.”

Technically you’re not putting the wires into the s ocket. You’re putting something the wires are connected to, called a “plug” (plug).  So “plug” is both a noun, describing that object that is at the end of an ele ctrical wire, and a verb meaning to put that object into a “socket” (socket). A “soc ket,” sometimes called a “wall socket,” is that thing in the wall that has electri city running to it. You put, or plug, something into the socket in order to get electrici ty to your T.V. or radio or phone charger or whatever it happens to be.

So, Ben is telling Nicola not to plug something int o a socket. He then says, “You’ll fry that old hair dryer.” The verb “to fry” (fry) h ere means to destroy something or ruin something, especially an electronic device, be cause of an inappropriate or improper amount of electricity used with it. Americ ans who travel to Europe, for example, have to be careful because most European c ountries use a different system of electricity. Here in the United States we  use 110 volts, and in many countries in Europe they use 220 volts.

Well, some older electronic devices don’t work on b oth systems. My electric toothbrush, for example, got fried when I plugged i t in once when I was visiting Europe several years ago. It wasn’t one that you co uld use with the different voltage that was used in that country. So, that’s w hat we mean by “to fry” something. It means the electronic device stops wor king because it has the wrong amount of electricity or type going through i t. A “hair (hair) dryer (dryer)” does what it says it does. It dries your hair. I us ed to have a hair dryer.

Nicola says, “I can’t, anyway,” meaning “I can’t pl ug in to this socket.” She says, “This plug has two prongs and that socket is design ed for three prongs.” A “prong” (prong) is one of those short pieces of met al that comes out of a plug that is used to connect the plug to the socket. In the U nited States, most sockets accept plugs that have two short, flat pieces of me tal. In many other countries the prongs are round, and therefore if you want to plug  something, say, from the United States into another socket in another countr y, you need what’s called an “adapter.”

And that’s what Ben talks about in the very next se ntence here. He says, “That’s why I brought these adapters.” An “adapter” (adapte r) is any small device that connects two things together that use different sys tems of connectors. So, for example, you may have a phone that uses one kind of  connector on one end of the electric cord used to charge the phone and a di fferent connector on the other end. If you need to connect two things together tha t have different connectors, you need an “adapter.”

For electronic devices, you may need something that  not only helps with the two different systems of prongs, but also with the actu al type of or amount of electricity. Ben refers to a “combination converter ” and “transformer.” A “converter” is anything that changes the electrical  current, such as from AC, or “alternating current,” to DC, or “direct current.” A “transformer” is something that changes the amount of voltage of the electric curre nt from, say, 220, which is used commonly in Europe, to 110, which is used for U.S. and Canadian electronic devices – and other countries as well, of course.

Nowadays, many electronic devices have their own co nverters and/or transformers built in so that you don’t need a sepa rate one, but older ones often do need converters and/or transformers. Ben continu es, “Our devices will either not work or will be ruined” – that is, will be dest royed – “if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.” An “outlet” (outlet) here means the same thing as a wall socket.

Nicola says, “I should have bought a travel hair dr yer with dual voltage.” “Dual” (dual) means two, or two types. So “dual voltage” i s something that works on both 110- and 220-volt electrical systems. Ben says , however, “You’d still need an adapter,” meaning even if the hair dryer was one  that had dual voltage, you still wouldn’t be able to plug it into the socket b ecause the prongs wouldn’t fit into a different socket. You would need an adapter for t hat to convert it from, say, a U.S.-style plug to one that would work in different  countries.

Nicola says, “Whatever,” meaning “Okay, I don’t wan t to talk about that anymore.” She says, “I’ve put them both on,” meanin g she has put the plug into an adapter and a transformer. “Now can I dry my hai r?” she asks. Ben says, “You can’t use that hair dryer because the cord is fraye d” (frayed). If something is “frayed,” it is coming apart. We especially use tha t for a rope or wire that has been used so much that it is starting to come apart . You can see the inside of the cord where the wire itself is. Whatever is around t hat wire is starting to fray, or to come apart.

Notice that Ben says the “cord” (cord) is frayed. T he cord is what goes between your electronic device and the socket. It’s what the plug is connected to. The cord has the wires in it that connect your device t o the socket. Ben says, “If you turn it on,” meaning if you turn that hair dryer on , “it may short circuit and then blow a fuse.” “To short circuit” (circuit) is when the electrical current starts to increase rapidly due to a problem with your wires, with your cord, or perhaps with the device itself. This can cause a fire and/or dam age your electrical device.

A “short circuit” can also cause you to “blow a fus e” (fuse). “To blow a fuse” means that there is too much power running and the electrical system shuts down. It stops. One of the safety devices that hous es and buildings have are what are called “fuses” (fuses) or nowadays, much m ore commonly, “circuit breakers.” What happens is that the electrical powe r stops going to a certain part of the house or building when too much power is bei ng drawn, when too much power is going through the wires.

In most modern buildings and houses, there are what  are called “circuit breakers.” There’s just a little switch that you ha ve to turn back on. In the old days, including in the house I grew up in many year s ago, we had what were called “fuses.” Inside of the fuse, which was basic ally a little cylinder, a little round tube, there was a wire that itself would brea k apart when too much power was going through it. In any case, Ben says that if  Nicola had a short circuit, they would end up being without electricity. Nicola says , “What am I supposed to do then?”

Ben says, “Good thing I brought mine,” meaning he b rought his own hair dryer. “Let me just check” – let me just see – “that the o utlet is grounded (grounded).” “To be grounded” means that there is an electrical wire that runs or goes from the plug to the ground so that it can take away any ext ra electrical charges in the case of a large amount of electricity going through  the wire, such as a short circuit or possibly a lightning strike – when a lar ge amount of electricity is running through the air and eventually the wire during a bad storm.

Ben says, “Yeah, I think it’s safe for you to use t his one.” Nicola says, “I won’t get electrocuted?” “To be electrocuted” (electrocuted) means to be hurt or even killed by having electricity go through your body. This ca n happen accidentally, of course. In some places, they kill people by electro cuting them when they have committed some sort of crime.

Ben says, “You won’t even get a little singed” (sin ged). “To be singed” means to be burnt a little bit. If you have long hair and are close to a fire, your hair might

start to burn. If you put it out quickly, it would get a little “singed.” It would get burnt, but not completely. I, fortunately, don’t ha ve to worry about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Dialogues are very powerful, but don’t worry – you won’t get electrocuted, thanks to the wonderful grounding of our scriptwriter, Dr.  Lucy Tse.
