This episode is called “Psychological Disorders.”  It’s something I’m very familiar with!  It’s a dialogue between Brett and Dr. Mollie  using a lot of vocabulary that you would find in a psychology class – or right her e at the Center for Educational Development!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Brett:  Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a  few minutes?

Dr. Mollie:  Certainly.  Have a seat.

Brett:  I’m really enjoying your psychology class a nd I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

Dr. Mollie:  Sure, go ahead.

Brett:  Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especially around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?

Dr. Mollie:  It’s hard to say without knowing your friend, but he may have an anxiety disorder or some type of phobia.

Brett:  I was afraid of that.  Well, I have another  friend who has mood swings all the time and washes his hands 50 times a day.

Dr. Mollie:  Again, I don’t know your friend so it’ s hard to make a diagnosis, but he may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obse ssive-compulsive.

Brett:  That sounds really serious.  Well, I have a nother friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire.  That’s bad, isn’t it?

Dr. Mollie:  It could be.  Your friend may have an eating disorder and his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania, but it’ s very hard to say.

Brett:  Did I mention that he likes to steal things , too?

Dr. Mollie:  People who feel compelled to steal may  have kleptomania.  Who are all of these friends you’re talking about?  Do I kn ow them?

Brett:  No, definitely not.

Dr. Mollie:  Hmm, would your “friends” like to make  an appointment with a therapist?  It sounds like it may be a good idea.

Brett:  No, no.  My “friends” wouldn’t like that.  He has a real fear of doctors.

The title of this episode is “Psychological Disorde rs.”  These are basically illnesses or diseases of the mind.  Brett begins by  saying, “Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a few minutes?”  Dr. Mollie says, “Certainly.  Have a seat (please sit down).”  Dr. Mollie is a professor of p sychology.  Brett says, “I’m really enjoying your psychology class.”  “Psychology” stud ies the way the human brain affects our thoughts, our behaviors; it’s a study o f emotions and so forth.

Brett says he’s really enjoying Dr. Mollie’s psycho logy class and he was wondering if he could ask her a few questions; he w ants to ask her a few questions.  Dr. Mollie says, “Sure, go ahead,” mean ing begin.  Brett says, “Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especial ly around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?”  “To be nervous” means to be worried, overly concerned about something, anxious.  Dr. Mollie say s, “It’s hard to say without knowing your friend (meaning it’s difficult for me to determine that), but he may have an anxiety disorder or some kind of phobia.”  “Anxiety” is the noun for anxious; it’s similar to nervous, worried.  A “diso rder” is a general term referring to some illness or sickness.  Here, we’re talking a bout a mental, not physical, health condition: an anxiety disorder.  A “phobia” (phobia) is a very strong fear of something.  If you have “arachnophobia” you are afr aid of spiders.  If you have “agoraphobia” you are afraid of open spaces, big pu blic spaces.  “Agora” is the old Greek word for the marketplace, where people wo uld come and buy and sell things in the middle of town.

Anyway, Dr. Mollie thinks perhaps that Brett’s frie nd has an anxiety disorder or some kind of phobia.  Brett says, “I was afraid of that (that’s what I feared).  Well,

I have another friend who has mood swings all the t ime and washes his hands 50 times a day.”  A “mood” is the way you are feeling;  you can have a good mood, you can be in a bad mood.  “Swing” (swing) here mea ns something that changes quickly, that goes up or down very quickly.  So, “m ood swings” are rapid, unexpected changes in someone’s emotions and feelin gs; one minute they’re laughing, the next minute they’re crying; one minut e you are very happy, and then the next minute you are very sad.  It sounds l ike what you would go through if you were watching the Los Angeles Dodgers baseba ll team last year!  Anyway, mood swings, then, are something that seemed to be affecting another one of Brett’s friends.  By the way, the word “swing” has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “disorder.”  Take a lo ok at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of both of those terms .

Brett’s friend also washes his hands 50 times a day .  So, he has mood swings and is always washing his hands.  Dr. Mollie says, “Again, I don’t know your friend so it’s hard to make a diagnosis.”  “To make  a diagnosis” (diagnosis) is when a doctor determines what is wrong with the pat ient – with the person who he or she is examining.  “To diagnose” as a verb me ans to determine what medical problem you have, although we use the word more generally to mean to figure out what’s wrong, what isn’t working.  Your mechanic, the person who fixes your car, may diagnose a problem in your motor – in  your engine.  Doctors diagnose illnesses.  Dr. Mollie says that it’s hard  to make a diagnosis, “but your friend may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obsessive-compulsive.”  “Bi” (bi) usually means two when it’s at the front of a word in English.  “Bipolar” is someone who is extremely happy and suddenly extreme ly depressed.  A “disorder,” remember, is an illness or disease.  So , this friend of Brett’s may have bipolar disorder.  He also may be a graduate studen t; those two things often mean the same thing!  Dr. Mollie says his friend al so may have obsessive- compulsive tendencies.  He may be someone who is “o bsessive,” that’s someone who is always worrying about one particular  thing, who can’t stop worrying about it.  Someone who’s “compulsive” is a lways repeating the same activity, someone who has to do something 20 times or 30 times.  If you saw the movie with Jack Nicholson and… what was her name?  The actress…um…you know…Helen Hunt, that’s it!  The movie was called A s Good as It Gets , from 1997.  Wonderful movie; it is about someone who is obsessive-compulsive, has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Brett says, “That sounds really serious.  Well, I h ave another friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire.  Tha t’s bad, isn’t it?”  Dr. Mollie says, “It could be.  Your friend may have an eating disor der.”  An “eating disorder” is when people either eat too much or they don’t eat e nough.  She continues, “his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania .”  “Pyromania” (pyromania)

comes from “pyro” meaning fire and “mania” meaning madness or craziness about something.  In this case, it is someone who i s fascinated by fires and often starts fires, things that can be very dangerous.  D r. Mollie says, “it’s hard to say,” it’s difficult to know what this person’s problem i s.  Brett said, “Did I mention that he likes to steal things, too (that he likes to rob  or steal things from other people)?”  Dr. Mollie says, “People who feel compel led to steal may have kleptomania.”  “To feel compelled to” means that yo u have a strong urge or strong desire to do something, that you have to do something or that you should do something.  “Kleptomania” is a condition where s omeone likes to steal things all time, but it’s a mental health condition, it is n’t just a normal criminal.

Mollie finally says, “Who are all of these friends you’re talking about?  Do I know them?”  Brett says, “No, definitely not.”  Mollie s ays, “Hmm, would your ‘friends’ like to make an appointment with a therapist?  It s ounds like it may be a good idea.”  A “therapist” is a person who provides trea tment and care for someone who has a mental illness or a mental disorder, or s imply someone who is having psychological difficulties.  Actually, the term “th erapist” is also used more generally to mean someone who helps someone recover  from an illness.  We have physical therapists, who help people who have had injuries to their arms or legs for example, to learn how to use them properly  again.

Of course, we think that Brett’s “friends” are real ly descriptions of Brett himself. People often say, “I have a friend,” when they real ly mean themselves.  Brett says, “No, no.  My ‘friends’ wouldn’t like that (th ey would not like to see a therapist).  They have a real fear of doctors.”  “A  real fear of” is a strong fear of, similar to a phobia.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
