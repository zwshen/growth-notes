This episode is called “Minor Medical Injuries.”  I t’s a dialogue between Cherise and Evan using vocabulary about ways that you may b e hurt, but not seriously. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Cherise:  Rise and shine!  Isn’t it a lovely day?  I love getting back to nature. There’s nothing like going camping.  How did you sl eep? 

Evan:  That was the most miserable night of my life !   

Cherise:  Really?  What happened? 

Evan:  I woke up in the middle of the night and tho ught I heard a bear.  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.  I have scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.  See? 

Cherise:  Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t any bears this late in the year?   

Evan:  How should I have known that?  This was my f irst time camping. 

Cherise:  All right.  Why are you holding your neck  like that?   

Evan:  I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping o n the ground.  I woke up with a crick in my neck. 

Cherise:  Stop moving around like that or you’ll re ally hurt yourself. 

Evan:  Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts ! 

Cherise:  I told you not to twist around like that.   Just let it work itself out. 

Evan:  All of this had to happen to me after gettin g a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.  I’ve ha d it!  I’m going back to civilization.   

Cherise:  How are you getting there? 

Evan:  What do you mean?  I’m walking. 

Cherise:  Without food or water?  You’d better wait  for me or you may end up bear bait after all! 

[end of dialogue] 

Cherise begins by saying, “Rise and shine!  Isn’t i t a lovely day?”  The expression “rise (rise) and shine (shine)” is a way of saying wake up, it’s time to get up.  It was probably more popular among an older generation , but you’ll still hear it sometimes in order to make a joke.  Cherise says, “ Isn’t it a lovely day (isn’t it a beautiful day)?” meaning it is a beautiful day.  Sh e says, “I love getting back to nature.”  The expression “to get back to nature” me ans to spend time outdoors, away from a building or a house, in order to experi ence this feeling of being in the natural world, maybe by a lake or a river or tr ees.  Cherise says, “There’s nothing like going camping,” and now we understand why she says that, because they are camping.  “To go camping” means to spend t ime outdoors, usually sleeping outdoors, sleeping perhaps in what we woul d call a “sleeping bag,” which is like a blanket in the form of a big bag th at you put yourself into to keep yourself warm.  For some additional information on this word “camp” go to our Learning Guide and look under the section What Else  Does It Mean.   

Cherise says to Evan, “How did you sleep?”  Evan sa ys, “That was the most miserable night of my life!”  “Miserable” (miserabl e) means very uncomfortable, very unpleasant; something you don’t want to do bec ause you suffered, it caused you some pain.  Cherise says, “Really?  What happen ed?” Evan says, “I woke up in the middle of the night (that is, after the time  that most people have fallen asleep) and thought I heard a bear (a large brown o r black animal typically, at least in the United States).  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.”  So, Evan got up, he got up off the ground presumably, we’re gues sing, and stubbed his toe. “To stub (stub) your toe” means to hit your foot ag ainst something by accident, causing pain in one of your 10 toes that are on you r feet.  It’s not a serious accident – you don’t break any bones, for example –  but it can hurt.  In Evan’s case, it caused him to trip (trip).  “To trip” mean s to fall or almost fall when you hit  

something, usually with your feet.  Evan says, “I h ave scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.”  A “scratch” is a long, thin cut on your skin; a little blood comes out but not very mu ch.  A “bruise” (bruise) is a large area on your skin that becomes blue or brown or purple, usually because you hit that part of your body against something, o r someone hit you.  So, Evan says that he has scratches – cuts – all over his ar ms, “not to mention these bruises on my legs,” he says.  “Not to mention” mea ns in addition I also have this.  He has bruises on his legs.  “See?” he says to Cherise.   

Cherise says, “Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t  any bears this late in the year?”  Evan says, “How should I have known that?” meaning I had no way of knowing that, because, he says, “This was my first time camping,” the first time that he went camping.  Cherise says, “All right.  W hy are you holding your neck like that?”  Evan is holding onto his neck with his  hand; he says, “I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping on the ground.”  “At al l” here is used for emphasis, meaning I wasn’t able to get comfortable in any way  by sleeping on the ground. Now, I have to agree with Evan.  I have gone campin g when I was a younger man.  I’ve gone camping where we just had a sleepin g bag on the ground, in the middle of a forest.  It was probably the worst coup le of days I have ever had!  I am not a camping kind of person, in fact I think yo u can divide the world into campers and non-campers, and campers should never m arry non-campers. Fortunately, I’m a non-camper and so is my wife.  I  can camp if I’m in like a truck, where I have a regular bed; that’s okay.  Camping o n the ground, I’ll leave that to the rest of you, meaning I’ll let you guys have fun  doing that while I’m sitting in my hotel. 

Evan doesn’t like camping, at least he hasn’t had a  good experience of it; he fell down, he didn’t sleep well, his neck hurts.  Evan s ays, “I woke up with a crick in my neck.”  A “crick (crick) in your neck” is when y ou have a muscle pain on the side of your neck, sometimes caused by the way that  you were sleeping, and it prevents you from turning your head from left to ri ght very easily.  If you’re sleeping on the ground without a nice pillow, well then, that may give you a crick in the neck. 

Cherise says, “Stop moving around like that or you’ ll really hurt yourself.”  We’re not sure what Evan is doing here, probably moving h is neck.  Evan says, “Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts!”  A “cramp”  (cramp) is a sharp feeling of pain, usually caused by a muscle that won’t relax p roperly.  If you are running or doing some sort of athletic event sometimes you wil l get cramps; your body will produce a sharp pain in the muscle.  It could happe n in your arms, it could happen in your legs; this happened to Evan’s should er. 

Cherise says, “I told you not to twist like that.”  “To twist” means to turn or rotate something in a particular direction.  You can find other meanings of the word “twist” in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Ch erise says, “Just let it work itself out.”  The expression “to work itself out” means to  have a problem fix itself; when something bad happens sometimes it will get better even if you don’t do anything, and that’s what Cherise is telling Evan t o do. 

Evan says, “All of this had to happen to me after g etting a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.”  A “sti tch (stitch) in your side” is a pain that you feel on one side of your body, usually bet ween your hip or your waist and your arms.  It’s often caused by doing too much  physical activity, often running is the problem.  A “charley horse” (charley ) horse (two words) is another word for a cramp, a painful cramp typically in your  leg.  Evan says, “I’ve had it!” meaning I’m very tired and frustrated about somethi ng and I don’t want to do it anymore.  Evan doesn’t want to go camping anymore.  He says, “I’m going back to civilization.”  “Civilization” can mean a partic ular society over many years that follow similar rules and customs.  In this case, it ’s really used to indicate somewhere that is not outdoors: a city, a town wher e there are buildings and hotels and restaurants, a place that has modern com forts and conveniences available. 

Cherise says, “How are you getting there?” meaning how are you going to get from where they are now to civilization, as Evan ca lls it.  Evan says, “What do you mean?  I’m walking.”  Cherise says, “Without fo od or water?”  She says, “You better wait for me.”  She’s giving him some ad vice: you should wait for me to go with you.  “Or,” she says, “you may end up be ar bait after all!”  “You may end up” means that the final result might be that y ou are bear (like the animal) bait (bait).  “Bait” is a small piece of food that’ s used to attract an animal, usually so that you can catch it.  You put the bait in some thing called a “trap,” and the animal comes to get the bait, and when it moves the  food the trap comes down on the animal to capture it – to keep it there, usu ally because you’re trying to get rid of it.  The most common trap that most people a re familiar with would be a mousetrap, trying to rid of mice that are in your h ouse.  The traditional bait for that is cheese – because everyone knows that mice l ove cheese!  Cherise is saying that Evan, if he’s not careful, may fall dow n, get injured, and become bait for a bear – the bear might eat him. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
