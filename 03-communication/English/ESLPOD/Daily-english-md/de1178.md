[start of dialogue]

Cameron: Oh, f***!

Dorothy: Watch your language. I don’t want the kids  to hear foul language.

Cameron: Sorry, I stubbed my toe. What’s the big de al? Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.

Dorothy: Not my kids, at least not yet. I don’t wan t them learning to swear before they learn to walk. I don’t want them to grow up to  be rude and offensive people.

Cameron: You can’t protect them from every damn thi ng people say.

Dorothy: Okay, that’s it. If you’re going to live h ere, we’ll need a swear jar.

Cameron: A what?!

Dorothy: A swear jar. For every swear word you say,  you’ll need to put a dollar into the jar. We’ll save the money for the kids’ ed ucation.

Cameron: What the f***?!

Dorothy: Hey, there will be no profanity of any kin d in this house. I don’t want you to be a bad influence on my children. Go ahead. Put  a dollar into that jar.

Cameron: I’m not putting a dollar into that jar.

 Dorothy: My house, my rules.

Cameron: Unbelievable!

Cameron begins by saying, “Oh, f***!” Well, we don’ t actually hear the word that Cameron is about to use or was going to use, but it  begins with the letter F. And you probably already know, without me having to exp lain it to you, that a very bad word in English begins with the letter F and en ds with the letter K and is four letters long.

Dorothy says to Cameron, “Watch your language.” The  expression “to watch your language” means to be careful with your words – in particular, to be careful that you don’t say any bad words, any “profanity” (profa nity). “Profanity” would be a very bad word, what we might call “foul language” –  words that you do not want your children to hear, words that are considered “v ulgar” (vulgar). A vulgar word is a word that is a bad word, that is inappropriate  for most situations. Dorothy says, “Watch your language. I don’t want the kids” – the children – “to hear foul language” (once again, “foul language” meaning bad words).

Cameron says, “Sorry, I stubbed my toe.” Your “toe”  is on your foot. Your hand has fingers. Your feet have toes. “To stub (stub) y our toe” is to hit your toe accidentally against something hard. We have all do ne this. You’re walking around your house without any shoes on and you acci dentally hit your foot against the chair and stub your toe. Your toe hits the chair and it hurts a lot, and sometimes when we get hurt, we like to use foul lan guage to express our pain or to express the emotion we’re going through when we feel that pain. That’s what Cameron did. He stubbed his toe.

Cameron doesn’t understand why Dorothy is upset wit h him. He says, “What’s the big deal?” A “big deal” is something that is im portant, something that is very significant. So when he asks, “What’s the big deal, ” he’s saying, “Why do you think this is so important?” When someone says, “Wh at’s the big deal?” he’s really saying, “I don’t think this is important. Wh y do you?” Cameron says, “Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.” “To  curse” (curse) means to use bad words, to use foul language.

Dorothy says, “Not my kids, at least not yet.” She means she doesn’t apparently allow her kids to watch TV shows and movies that ha ve cursing in them, that have foul language in them. And that’s very difficu lt to do nowadays. Even

television in the United States has a lot of foul l anguage that you would not want your children to hear. Dorothy continues, “I don’t want them,” meaning her children, “learning to swear before they learn to w alk.” “To swear” (swear) means the same as “to curse.” It means to use foul langua ge, to use vulgarities, to use bad words, to use profanity.

I should point out that technically, or at least, o ne meaning of “to curse” would be to use the name of God or some higher authority whe n you are swearing – in particular, to perhaps ask God to do something bad to another person or even the situation in which you are in. The word “God” o ften gets connected with the word “damn” (damn) followed by the word “it” or a p erson. Someone who is frustrated, for example, might say, “God damn it.” I don’t like the term and I would not suggest you use that term. It is considered fou l language in polite conversation.

Dorothy says she doesn’t want her children “to lear n to swear before they learn to walk,” meaning her children are probably very yo ung since children learn to walk at a young age. “I don’t want them to grow up to be rude and offensive people.” “Rude” (rude) means not polite. Someone wh o is rude to you says something bad to you or isn’t very polite to you. “ Offensive” (offensive) is when you hurt another person’s feelings or when you insu lt someone. Cameron says, “You can’t protect them from every damn thing peopl e say.”

Remember, I said the word “damn” is sometimes used with the word “God,” but “damn” itself is also considered a foul word or a s wear word. Certainly my mother would never allow me to use that word in our house when I was growing up. It’s used as an adjective when you are frustrated or whe n you are angry at something. Again, it’s considered rude. It’s consid ered foul language and not the sort of thing you would use in public, and certainl y not the sort of thing you would want to use around children, although I’m sure some  parents do when they’re angry.

Dorothy doesn’t like it. She says, “Okay, that’s it . If you’re going to live here, we’ll need a swear jar.” A “swear jar” (jar) is a contain er that some people use in some families as a way of trying to punish people, child ren in a family, from using foul language. Every time you use a bad word, you have t o put money into the swear jar as a punishment. “Jars” are containers that are  usually made out of glass. When you buy certain kinds of food like, I don’t kn ow, jam or pickles or olives, they’re typically are sold in the stores in jars, i n glass containers.

Well, Dorothy is going to have Cameron put money in to a swear jar every time he uses a bad word. She explains this. She says, “For every swear word you say,

you’ll need to put a dollar into the jar. We’ll sav e the money for the kids’ education.” I’m not exactly sure what the relations hip is between Dorothy and Cameron; perhaps Cameron is some sort of relative w ho is staying with Dorothy, a brother or a cousin perhaps. Dorothy says the money in the swear jar will be used for their children’s education. Cameron is sho cked, surprised by this. So he almost swears again. He says, “What the f***?!”

Dorothy says, “Hey, there will be no profanity of a ny kind in this house. I don’t want you to be a bad influence on my children.” A “ bad influence” would be something or someone that causes another person to be worse. Parents often worry about their children’s friends because they d on’t want their children to have bad influences in their life – other children who m ay make their children worse perhaps than they already are. Movies, books, telev ision programs could also be considered bad influences, depending on their conte nts, of course.

Dorothy says, “Go ahead. Put a dollar into that jar .” Cameron says, “I’m not putting a dollar into that jar.” Dorothy then says something that many parents will say to their teenage children or adult children who  are living with them: “My house, my rules,” meaning I own this house, therefo re you must follow my rules, my regulations.

Cameron says, “Unbelievable!” The word here, “unbel ievable,” is used to express frustration about how surprised you are by somethin g because you think it is so unreasonable, because you think it is wrong. Nevert heless, it is Dorothy’s house, and so Cameron – if he wants to live there, whoever  he is – will have to follow her rules.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
