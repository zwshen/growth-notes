This episode is a dialogue between Suzanne and Geor ge about sending something to someone else in a big package. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanne: Pass me the packing tape. This box is read y to be sealed.

George: Wait! You can’t just send our product like that. It needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.

Suzanne: That doesn’t speak well for our product, d oes it?

George: It has nothing to do with the quality of ou r product. It’s all about the quality of the packing. Hand me some bubble wrap.

Suzanne: Here.

George: See what I’m doing? I’m wrapping each produ ct in two layers of bubble wrap, placing them in the box, and then filling in the gaps with packing peanuts. Got that?

Suzanne: Fine, I’ll pack it the way you want it. What about these smaller products? You want them packed in a box?

George: No, the smaller products should be shipped in padded mailers like these.

Suzanne: Should I wrap the product in bubble wrap f irst?

 George: No, these padded mailers should protect the m from impact.

Suzanne: Good. Let’s put on a label and be done wit h it.

George: Hold on. These boxes and mailers need to be  taped up so they don’t open during shipping. Make sure all openings are se aled.

Suzanne: Okay, now are we done?

George: Sure, with this batch – just 64 more to go.

Suzanne: Uh!

[end of dialogue]

Suzanne says to George, “Pass me,” or give to me, “ the packing tape.” “Packing” (packing) comes from the verb “to pack” (pack). “To  pack” is to put things into a box or some other container that you are going to s tore or keep those items in, or send them through the mail or some other service to  another person. “Packing tape (tape) is a sticky substance on one side that you put on a package or a box in order to keep it closed. There are different kin ds of tape. Some tape is very thin, only a few millimeters wide; other tape is mu ch wider.

Suzanne is asking for the packing tape. She says, “ This box is ready to be sealed.” “To be sealed” (sealed) means to be closed  so that nothing comes out of it. You need to “seal” a package before you mail it  or send it to someone. You don’t want everything coming out of the box. George , however, says, “Wait! You can’t just send our product like that.” A “product”  is something a company makes to sell to someone. So we’re talking about a busine ss product here.

George says, “The product needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.” “Protected” comes from the verb “to protect” (prote ct). “To protect” means to take care of someone or something so that it is not harm ed or damaged. “To protect a product” means to make sure it doesn’t break – in t his case, that it doesn’t break “in transit” (transit). The expression “in transit”  means while something is being moved from one place to another, especially in the mail. Suzanne says, “That doesn’t speak well for our product, does it?”

Suzanne is saying that the fact you have to protect  the product in order to ship it means that perhaps the product isn’t very good or v ery strong. That’s what she means by the expression, “It doesn’t speak well.” “ To speak well” normally

means to say good things about someone or something . Here it means to reflect on or to be an indication of the quality of the pro duct. George says, however, that the fact they have to protect the product in order to ship it – in order to mail it or to send it – doesn’t have anything to do with the q uality of their product.

George says, “It’s all about,” or it’s mainly conce rned with, “the quality of the packing.” He then says, “Hand me,” meaning give me,  “some bubble wrap.” “Bubble (bubble) wrap (wrap)” is something you use to pack or protect something you are sending. Bubble wrap consists of plastic sh eets that have little pockets or bubbles of air. You’ve probably seen these. You can  take your finger and burst, or break open, the little bubbles and they make sou nds. It’s kind of fun. People like to do this sitting around watching television sometimes. Well, I don’t, but some people do.

George is saying that he wants some bubble wrap to protect the product. By the way, the word “wrap” can also be a verb. “To wrap” means to surround something with another piece of material that will protect what is inside. George says he’s “wrapping each product in two layers of b ubble wrap.” A “layer” (layer) is one of many pieces of material that is covering,  in this case, an object for protection. George says he’s “wrapping each product  in two layers of bubble wrap, placing them,” or putting them, “in the box, and then filling in the gaps with packing peanuts.”

A “gap” (gap) is a space between two other things. It’s a place where there is a small opening between two things, we might say. You  could have a gap in the door if your door is not completely closed. There’s  just an inch or two of space between the door and the, what we would call, “fram e” of the door that the door closes into. That’s a gap. You could have a gap, as  is the case in our dialogue, in a box – between the side of the box and where the t hing you put in the box is located. George says he’s going “to fill in the gap s” – that is, put something in those small spaces – “with packing peanuts” (peanut s).

Normally, a “peanut” is a small thing that you eat.  It’s technically the seed of a certain kind of plant. Peanuts are very popular in the United States; people even make peanut butter, which they use on sandwiches. I  don’t like peanut butter myself, but many people do – but here the word “pea nut” doesn’t refer to an actual piece of food but rather a small piece of pl astic, basically, that is made to look like a small peanut and is used when packing t hings in large boxes.

“Packing peanuts,” then, are small pieces of plasti c – what we would call “Styrofoam” – in the shape of peanuts that are used  to protect things that are being mailed and sent in a box. Suzanne says, “Fine , I’ll pack it the way you want

it. What about these smaller products? You want the m packed in a box?” Suzanne speaks somewhat informally here. Notice she  doesn’t say, “Do you want them packed in a box,” but simply, “You want t hem packed in a box?” You know she’s asking a question, and the “do” (technic ally the auxiliary or helping verb) is implied.

George says, “No, the smaller products should be sh ipped in padded mailers like these.” “To ship” (ship) something means to send it , either in the government mail service or using some private delivery service  such as DHL or FedEx or UPS here in the United States. George is telling Su zanne to ship or send small products in “padded mailers.” The word “pad” (pad) refers to something that is used to protect something else. “Padding” is protec tion that you put around something. Bubble wrap is a kind of padding.

A “padded mailer” (mailer) is an envelope that has padding in it. When you buy the envelope, there is already a kind of bubble wra p or padding that is part of the envelope and is used to protect what’s inside the e nvelope or the mailer. Suzanne says, “Should I wrap the product in bubble wrap first?” George says, “No, these padded mailers should protect them,” mea ning the products, “from impact” (impact). “Impact” is the moment when two t hings hit each other, often causing damage.

So, what George is saying here is that the padded m ailers will protect the products inside even if the mailers hit something e lse. Suzanne says, “Good. Let’s put on,” or let’s attach, “a label and be don e with it.” A “label” (label) is usually a piece of paper that is put on something s uch as a box to tell you either what is inside the box or to whom you are sending t he box. You can’t ship a box through the mail without telling the postal service  where it’s going. That information about whom you are sending it to goes o n the label.

The expression “be done (done) with it” means simpl y that we are finished with something and no longer have to worry about it. If someone says, “Let’s be done with it,” he means let’s finish this and no longer worry about it. George, however, says, “Hold on,” meaning “wait.” “These boxes and m ailers need to be taped up so they don’t open during shipping.” “To tape up” i s a phrasal verb which means basically to put tape on something. There isn’t a d ifference in meaning, or much of a difference, between “to tape a box” and “to ta pe up a box.” The “up” provides a little bit of emphasis.

George says, “Make sure all openings are sealed.” A n “opening” (opening) is the same as a gap, when two things are not closed compl etely. Suzanne says, “Okay, now are we done?” George says, “Sure, with t his batch – just 64 more to

go.” A “batch” (batch) is one of many groups of ite ms that are handled or taken care of at the same time. If you have to send, for example, 100 boxes, you might take care of them in batches of 10 boxes each. Firs t you do these 10 boxes, then you do the next 10 boxes, and so on.

George says to Suzanne that they are done with this  batch, and they just have “64 batches more to go,” meaning left to finish. Su zanne doesn’t sound very happy about that at the end of the dialogue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
