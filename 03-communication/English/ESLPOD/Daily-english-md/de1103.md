This episode is a dialogue between Marcela and Kenj i about trying to become a member of a sports team. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcela: All right, you’re ready for these tryouts.  You’ve passed your physical. You’ve trained for months. You’re going to make tha t team.

Kenji: It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk. I’m just  going to do the best I can.

Marcela: Yes, but you want to have your head in the  right place. You’re going to dominate the field. You’re going to intimidate the other players.

Kenji: No, I only want to impress the coach. I’m go ing to play hard and hold nothing back.

Marcela: Yes, that’s fine, but you want to send a m essage to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

Kenji: I’m going to have faith in my abilities and hope for the best.

Marcela: At least try to look tough. Try scowling a t the other players like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them .

Kenji: [sigh] I tell you what, why don’t you scowl for me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game .

Marcela begins our dialogue by saying to Kenji, “Al right, you’re ready for these tryouts.” A “tryout” (tryout) is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to do something. Usually it is something you have to do i n order to become a member of a sports team or perhaps even a musical group. A  “tryout” is when you go in front of sometimes a coach or another judge who dec ides if you are good enough to be a member of this group or this team.

So, a “sports tryout” would involve you going and p laying the sport in front of a group of coaches or in front of a coach who is goin g to decide whether you are good enough to be part of this sports team. Another  word for a tryout that we often use when we’re talking about a musical produc tion or a movie or a television show is “audition” (audition).

Marcela says to Kenji, “You’ve passed your physical .” A “physical,” as a noun, is a medical examination that determines whether you a re healthy enough to participate – in this case, in a certain sport. Chi ldren often get physicals every year or every other year to make sure that they’re growing properly, that they don’t have any physical problems that they need to take care of. Adults should also get a physical once a year or every other year . I know I do.

Marcela says Kenji passed his physical, meaning his  doctor determined that he was good enough to participate in this particular s port. Marcela says, “You’ve trained for months,” meaning you’ve been preparing physically for months. “You’re going to make that team.” “To make (make) a  team” means to be selected to participate in a team, to be chosen as a member of a team.

Kenji says, “It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk.” A  “pep (pep) talk” is a speech that encourages one or more people to do a good job. It’ s a way of motivating someone or a group of people. Sometimes, before a s ports game, the coach of the team will talk to the team and give them a pep talk – try to get them motivated and enthusiastic about going out and winning the ga me.

Kenji says, “I’m just going to do the best I can.” Marcela says, “Yes, but you want to have your head in the right place.” The expressi on “to have your head (head) in the right place” means to be thinking about the right thing – to be focused, to be concentrated on what you are trying to do. It me ans to be psychologically prepared for a certain activity.

Marcela says, “You’re going to dominate the field.”  “To dominate” (dominate) in this sentence means to be better than anyone else, to be the best. Marcela adds, “You’re going to intimidate the other players.” “To  intimidate” (intimidate) means

to scare someone, to frighten someone because you a re stronger or more confident than he is. “Intimidation” is usually a b ad thing.

Here Marcela is saying that Kenji should intimidate  the other players, the other people on the team, in such a way that they are afr aid of him because he’s such a good player, I think is the idea. Kenji says, “No , I only want to impress the coach.” “To impress” (impress) someone is to show s omeone that you have a lot of talent or skill – to have that person think that  you are very good at what you do, to have a person admire you.

A “coach” (coach) is the person who is the head of a sports team, the person who is in charge of telling the players what to do and of making plans for how the team will play. Kenji says, “I’m going to play hard  and hold nothing back.” “To play hard” means to try very hard to win a game or a competition, to put all the effort that you can into winning. “To hold nothing back” is something similar. It means to do something at the maximum level, to do s omething with the maximum effort that you can.

Marcela says, “Yes, that’s fine, but you want to se nd a message to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.” “ To send a message” to someone doesn’t mean to email them, necessarily. It  means to communicate something very clearly to another person or group of people so that there is no possibility of them not understanding. You’re makin g something very clear to them.

Marcela is telling Kenji to send a message to the o ther players. What message? The message that he is “a force (force) to be recko ned (reckoned) with.” If you are a force to be reckoned with, you are someone wh o is too important or too powerful to be ignored. You are a person that the o ther people have to deal with somehow. They can’t ignore you. They have to do som ething about you. Marcela is telling Kenji to act in such a way that the othe r players know that he is a force to be reckoned with.

Kenji says, “I’m going to have faith in my abilitie s and hope for the best.” “To have faith in” something or someone is to believe i n something or someone – to think that this thing or person is real and good ev en if you can’t see it or even if you don’t have all the information that you might n eed to know it for sure. It can also mean to trust in something or someone.

Marcela says, “At least try to look tough” (tough).  “To look tough” means to look strong, to look like you are capable of doing thing s that are very difficult. In fact, we sometimes use this word “tough” as an adjective to mean difficult, but here it

means to look strong. If you say, “That guy looks t ough,” you mean he looks physically strong, maybe big enough to hurt you. My  ex-girlfriend was like that.

Anyway, Marcela says, “Try scowling at the other pl ayers like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them.” Marce la is obviously trying to get Kenji to be tougher. She’s telling Kenji to scowl ( scowl). “To scowl” is to make a mean expression on your face. Often it involves par tially closing your eyes – not closing them all the way, but making this mean expr ession on your face.

“To crush” (crush) means to completely beat or defe at someone. For example, “The Los Angeles Dodgers crushed the San Francisco Giants 10 to nothing in the baseball game yesterday.” That’s just a hypothe tical. If a team wins by a large score, we say the team “crushed” the other te am. That’s what Marcela wants Kenji to do to the other players. Kenji sighs . He makes a sound indicating that he is tired, really, of hearing Marcela give h im advice.

He says, “I tell you what.” “I tell you what” is an  informal phrase used to make a suggestion or to present a new idea for another per son to think about or to consider. You could also say, “I’ll tell you what.”  “I will tell you what.” But the more informal and perhaps a little more common expr ession is “I tell you what.” Kenji says, “I tell you what, why don’t you scowl f or me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game .” Kenji is saying to Marcela that she seems to be tougher and scarier than any of the people who are on the sports team.

Now, we don’t know what kind of sport this is. It m ight be American football. It might be basketball. But in any case, Kenji doesn’t  really want to hear Marcela’s advice and thinks that Marcela should perhaps just go out and try to be the one who scowls and is scary to the other players. I hav e to say, I wasn’t really very big into sports and sport teams when I was in schoo l, although I was on my seventh- and eighth-grade volleyball team. Not exac tly American football, but I thought we were pretty tough.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
