This episode is a dialogue between Lillian and Amos  about different kinds of nurses – people who help you in a hospital or at a doctor’s office or wherever you find them. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lillian: I’d like to become a nurse like you. I wou ld have a great bedside manner. 

Amos: It’s a difficult job, but I like it. I’m a re gistered nurse, but there are a lot of different types of nurses. If you’re willing to get  an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a nurse pract itioner. 

Lillian: I don’t think I want to spend a lot of tim e in school. 

Amos: Then you just need a little more training aft er your bachelor’s degree. You can be a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse , emergency room nurse, operating room nurse, critical care or intensive ca re nurse, or a home care nurse.  

Lillian: Well, I dropped out of college. I just cou ldn’t hack it. 

Amos: Hmm, then you might want to consider becoming  a certified nursing assistant. You’ll still need to go through a traini ng program, though, and to become certified. 

Lillian: That still sounds like a lot of studying. 

Amos: You do want to work in nursing, don’t you? 

Lillian: I do, but I thought all I’d have to do is serve meals, talk to the patients, and make them comfortable. That’s what they do on T V. 

Amos: Then my advice to you is to become an actor a nd play a nurse on TV. I think that might be the closest you’re going to get  to the nursing profession.

Lillian begins by saying to Amos, “I’d like to beco me a nurse like you. I would have a great bedside manner.” The expression “bedsi de (bedside) manner (manner)” is used to refer to the way in which a do ctor, a nurse, or some other medical professional helps people who are sick when  they are sick. The word “bedside” means being next to or on the side of you r bed in a hospital when you are ill or sick. “Bedside manner” refers to how wel l a doctor or a nurse or someone else can talk to you and relate to you as a  patient, as someone who is sick.  

Amos says that being a nurse is “a difficult job.” It’s hard to define the word “nurse.” A nurse does a lot of different things. Us ually nurses work with doctors who have medical degrees and pass tests that allow them to do certain things with people in terms of helping them become better or helping them get over illnesses. A nurse is someone who also has a degree  – goes and studies and passes exams or tests to help people who are sick. But a nurse can’t do many of the things that a doctor can do.  

Amos says that he’s a “registered nurse.” There are  different kinds of nurses in the United States. One kind is called a “registered  (registered) nurse,” sometimes abbreviated with the letters “RN.” A registered nur se is someone who studies nursing as what we would call an “undergraduate” – that is, they go to college usually for four years and then they take an examin ation and get their permission to work as an RN. Although Amos is an RN, he explai ns that there are a lot of different types of nurses. He says, “If you’re will ing to get an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a n urse practitioner.”  

The term “advanced degree” refers to a degree or an  academic certification that goes beyond a four-year undergraduate or bachelor’s  degree. So, if you study for four years and you get a bachelor’s degree, and the n you decide you want to get something above a bachelor’s degree, you would stud y an additional one or two years and get, for example, a master’s degree. You could then continue studying, as I did, and get a PhD or a doctorate, or you coul d get an MD, which is a medical degree that makes you a medical doctor.  

A “PhD” is someone who usually does research, who i s involved in theoretical issues, who is trying to create new knowledge by st udying and researching something. A “medical doctor” is a practical degree , someone who actually takes knowledge, scientific knowledge, and applies it in a real world setting with the person – or as my old professor used to say, “The P hDs design the cars and the MDs fix them.” I suspect most medical doctors don’t  agree with that analogy or comparison. Anyway, I’m getting myself in trouble w ith all the doctors out there. The medical doctors, that is.  

The advanced degree Amos is talking about is not to  become a doctor, but to become either a “clinical nurse specialist” or a “n urse practitioner.” A “clinical (clinical) nurse specialist” is someone who studies  one particular area of medicine that interests him and then gets some sort  of degree or certificate in that area. It might be someone who likes working sp ecifically with children, or someone who likes working specifically with certain  diseases of the heart. A “clinical nurse specialist,” then, is someone who s tudies beyond just the required knowledge needed to become a registered nurse and g ets extra knowledge about one area.  

A “nurse practitioner” (practitioner) is, in some w ays, the highest level for a nurse, in the sense that a nurse practitioner is able to d o some of the things that a doctor does, such as looking at you and trying to i dentify (or we would use the word “diagnose”) what’s wrong with you. A nurse pra ctitioner can also give you certain kinds of medicine. I had a nurse practition er at one of the local medical clinics that I used to go to many years ago and he was very good. He was almost as good as the doctor that I had, and in some ways better. 

Lillian says, however, “I don’t think I want to spe nd a lot of time in school.” Amos says, “Then you just need a little more training af ter your bachelor’s degree.” A “bachelor’s degree” is what you get after studying in college for four years – after being what we would describe as an “undergraduate.”  So when you graduate high school in the United States and you want to ge t a college degree, you go and study usually for four years, sometimes more, a nd you get a “bachelor’s degree.”  

Amos is telling Lillian that she doesn’t have to st udy all that much beyond her four-year degree. She could become a “licensed prac tical nurse,” an “emergency room nurse,” an “operating room nurse,” a “critical  care or intensive care nurse,” or a “home care nurse.” These are all different spe cialties in the field or area of nursing.  

A “licensed practical nurse” is someone who works w ith a registered nurse – someone who doesn’t have the same amount of trainin g as a registered nurse. An “emergency room nurse” is someone who works, log ically, in an emergency room. An “emergency room” is the place in a hospita l where you go when you need medical treatment or to be seen by a doctor im mediately. If you break your leg or burn your hand, you would go to the emergenc y room so that they could look at you right away. There are nurses who are sp ecialists in that area.  

An “operating room nurse” is someone who works with  doctors who are doing surgeries. An “operating room” is a place where the  doctor will usually take a knife and cut you open or somehow make a hole in yo ur body to try to fix what’s wrong with your body. When the doctor goes inside y our body somehow to fix you, that is called an “operation,” and it typicall y happens in an “operating room.” 

“Intensive” or “critical care” refers to when you a re very sick, close to dying, and the hospital needs to watch you very carefully. Tha t’s called “intensive (intensive) care” or “critical (critical) care.” Again, there a re nurses that specialize or are experts in that one area. There are also “home care  nurses.” A home care nurse is someone who goes to your house or apartment or c ondominium, or wherever you live, and gives you help there – takes care of you there. You may be there because you can’t go to the hospital. More typicall y it’s for someone who was in a hospital and is then sent home but needs some add itional help from the nurse.  

Lillian says, “Well, I dropped out of college.” “To  drop out of” something means to stop participating in some activity. In this case, Lillian is saying that she dropped out of college, meaning she went to college maybe f or a year or two but then stopped before she got her bachelor’s degree. Amos is talking about all of these kinds of nurses that require – many, but not all of  them – a bachelor’s degree.  

Lillian says she doesn’t have one. She says she “co uldn’t hack it.” The expression “to hack (hack) it” means to be able to do something that is difficult, to be successful at a difficult job or task. If someon e says, “I can’t hack it,” he means I can’t do it. It’s too hard for me. Lillian says it was too hard for her to go to college. Amos says, “Hmm, then you might want to  consider becoming a certified nursing assistant.” The word “certified” (certified) refers to someone who passes a test or is somehow shown to be able to do something. An “assistant” is someone who helps another person.  

A “certified nursing assistant” is someone who is n ot a registered nurse but has studied something about nursing – enough to help nu rses do what they do. There are the nurses who do not go to school for four yea rs, who may only study for a year and a half or two years and get another kind o f certificate or permission to  

work as a nurse, but not doing all of the things th at a registered nurse can do. A certified nursing assistant is an example of that. 

Amos says, “You’ll still need to go through a train ing program to become certified” – that is, you have to get permission af ter passing a test and studying. Lillian says, “That sounds like a lot of studying.”  Amos says, “You do want to work in nursing, don’t you?” Amos is beginning to w onder whether Lillian actually wants to become a nurse at all, at any level. Lilli an says, “I do, but I thought all I’d have to do is serve meals,” meaning give people foo d, “talk to patients” – that is, talk to the people who are sick – “and make them co mfortable. That’s what they do on TV.”  

So now we understand Lillian has been watching tele vision and she only sees nurses doing these things in hospitals and doesn’t realize that, of course, they have to study, go to college, and pass examinations  to become nurses. Amos says, “Then my advice to you” – what I would sugges t to you – “is to become an actor and play a nurse on TV.” Amos is saying well,  if you want to do what they do on TV, then you should just become an actor and pretend to be a nurse.  

“I think that might be the closest you’re going to get to the nursing profession,” Amos says. A “profession” (profession) is a job tha t you get paid to do that usually requires some education, training, and expe rience. A “profession” is a kind of job. We talk about the “teaching profession ,” or the “nursing profession,” or more generally, the “medical profession.” These terms simply refer to the jobs that are related to that particular area. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
