On this episode, we’re going to take a trip to the butcher’s.  A “butcher” is someone who cuts and prepares meat, and sells it.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Butcher:  What can I get for you?  Gina:  I’d like a pound of ground beef, please.    Butcher:  Would you like the regular or the extra lean?  The extra lean is a dollar more per pound.  Gina:  I’ll take the regular.  Could you also throw in two thick pork chops and two chicken breasts?  Butcher:  I’m sorry, but we’re out of chicken breasts right now, but we have some thighs.  Gina:  Hmm...In that case, I’ll just take some ham.  I’d like that thinly sliced.  Butcher:  Okay, is there anything else?  Gina:  Yes, I’d like some other cold cuts, but I’m not sure which ones.  Why don’t you give me half a pound of salami and a pound of bologna?    Butcher:  No problem.  Will that be all?  Gina:  No, I’d like two steaks.  Do you have any that are very, very tender?  The ones I bought last week were really tough.
