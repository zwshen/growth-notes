On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Pierre and Irene about finding something new – making a discovery. L et’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pierre: How does it feel to be on the cusp of a new  discovery?

Irene: Let’s not jump the gun. We’ve made some majo r leaps forward, but I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.

Pierre: Not yet, but you’re close to a breakthrough . That’s evident.

Irene: I think you might be overstating the case. I f we do make a small breakthrough, it will only contribute to the curren t body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its head.

Pierre: I think you’re downplaying the possible imp act of such a discovery. I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer, a real trailblaz er.

Irene: And your contribution?

Pierre: You know what they say: Behind every great woman is a great man!

Pierre asks Irene, “How does it feel to be on the c usp of a new discovery?” “To be on the cusp” (cusp) of something means to be at the moment when something very interesting is going to happen, to be at the p oint in time where something important or exciting will happen. We often use this expression when we’re about

to find out something new or discover something. “T o discover” (discover) is to find out about something that you didn’t know about  before. “Discovery” is the noun that comes from the verb “to discover.”

Pierre asks about a “new discovery,” although anyth ing that is discovered is by definition “new,” at least to the person who discov ers it. Irene says, however, “Let’s not jump the gun.” “To jump (jump) the gun ( gun)” means to do something too soon – to do something before you are ready or before you are prepared, or perhaps simply before you’re supposed to.

When you have a race – when a group of people are r unning, such as at the Olympics – the traditional way of starting the race  is to fire a gun, to make a loud noise with a gun and that begins the race. If you s tart running before the gun makes its sound, you have “jumped the gun.” You hav e gone before you should have gone. We use the expression more generally to mean to do something “prematurely” – before you should or too soon.

Irene says, “We’ve made some major leaps forward, b ut I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.” We’re not sure ex actly what Irene is talking about, but she says that in whatever they’re doing,  they’ve “made some major,” or large, “leaps forward.” A “leap” (leap) is a lon g jump. Here it signifies or means a significant advance in something – to make a lot of progress.

“I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revol utionary,” Irene says. Something that is “revolutionary” is something that  is very exciting, something that will change society in an important way. That’ s one definition of “revolutionary.” “Revolutionary” could also refer of course to the overthrow, sometimes violent overthrow, of a government – the change of a government.

Pierre says, “Not yet,” meaning yes, we haven’t dis covered anything revolutionary yet. “But,” Pierre continues, “you’re close to a breakth rough.” A “breakthrough” (breakthrough) – one word – is a sudden and signifi cant discovery, something that advances your knowledge or your ability to do something significantly. Pierre thinks Irene is “close to a breakthrough.” He says,  “That’s evident” (evident).”That’s evident” means that’s apparent. T hat’s easy to see. That’s obvious.

Irene, however, says, “I think you might be oversta ting the case.” “To overstate (overstate) the case (case)” means to exaggerate, to describe something as being bigger or more important than it really is. I rene says, “If we do make a

small breakthrough, it will only contribute,” or ad d, “to the current body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its h ead.”

A “body of knowledge” is a certain amount of inform ation or research about a certain area of study. You could talk about the bod y of knowledge in physics. That would include everything we know, basically, a bout physics or perhaps about one specific area of physics. “To turn someth ing on its head” means to change something completely, to change something en tirely. Irene is saying that whatever discovery is made by her, it’s not going to “turn the field,” whatever area of study she’s working in, “on its head.” It’s  not going to change it completely.

Pierre disagrees. He says, “I think you’re downplay ing the possible impact of such a discovery.” “To downplay” (downplay) means to do or say something that makes something not seem very important or signific ant – to treat something as being less important than it really is. It’s sort of the opposite of “overstating the case.” Pierre says that he thinks Irene is “downpla ying the possible impact” (impact) of a discovery. The “impact” is the influe nce, the consequences.

He says, “I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer , a real trailblazer.” A “pioneer” (pioneer) is a person who does something for the fi rst time or goes somewhere that no one else has been to before. A “trailblazer ” (trailblazer) – one word – means something similar. It’s a person who is the f irst to do something. In addition, a trailblazer is someone who other people  follow, who other people imitate.

Irene then asks Pierre, “And your contribution?” A “contribution” is what you give to someone or something to support the effort, to s upport the goal. Irene is asking Pierre what his contribution to this effort will be considered. How will people think about his contribution to whatever it is that Irene is doing? Pierre says, “You know what they say: Behind every great w oman is a great man!”

This is actually a joke based upon a common phrase,  “Behind every great man is a great woman,” which means that whenever you read about or hear about a man doing something great, there is often a wife or  a woman who is helping that man in some way or at least loving and supporting the man, typically the husband. Well, Pierre is switching this around. He’ s changing the expression, “Behind every great woman is a great man,” and that ’s what Pierre is saying he will be considered as, we would guess: Irene’s husb and.

The word “behind” (behind) here means supporting or  helping in a way that you can’t see or you don’t notice. So every great man, in the traditional saying, is

accomplishing things, is doing things, with the hel p of a woman. Again, typically a wife. But of course, Pierre is Irene’s husband, and  so he’s the great man behind the great woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Her scripts are revolutionary in the world of Engli sh language teaching. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse, our scrip twriter.
