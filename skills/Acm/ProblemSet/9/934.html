</font>

<P align="justify">

Consider a set of rectangles in <b>2D</b> space as illustrated in the
figure below. Overlapping or not, they define a set of regions with
different shapes (in the example given, there are twelve regions,
identified from <b>A</b> to <b>L</b>). Lets <b>OD</b> (Overlapping
Depth) be the number of rectangles that overlap in each region (in the
figure, <b>OD</b> is the number associated to each region). In this
example, the maximum value of <b>OD</b> is 3 and it appears twice, in
regions <b>E</b> and <b>G</b>.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 
Write a program that given a set of rectangles, computes
the total area of the regions with the maximum value
<b>OD<sub>MX</sub></b> (this corresponds to the sum of the areas of
region <b>E</b> and region <b>G</b> shown in the figure). In order
to avoid numerical problems, it is ensured that there are no
coincidences between edges of different rectangles. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 
The first input line contains the number <b>NR</b>  (integer format)
of rectangles (0 <= <b>NR</b> <= 100). Each of the following 
<b>NR</b> lines contain the coordinates of two opposed vertices of a
rectangle, in the sequence <b>x1 y1 x2 y2</b>, separated by single
spaces. In this case, no order is assumed for point 1 and point 2 and
numbers may be written in integer or in decimal format. The separator
between values is the space character. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 
One decimal number, rounded to two decimal digits, representing the
computed area.
