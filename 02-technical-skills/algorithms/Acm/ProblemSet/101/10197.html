<P>
Portuguese is one of the most beautiful languages in the whole world, but almost everyone
who speaks Portuguese is either brazilian or portuguese. Since people all around the world (and not just
brazilians) are participating in this contest, we would like to help you to begin
learning portuguese with this problem. Well, the program you'll write will help you (if it's
correct).
<p>
All you must to do is to write a <i>conjugator</i>, that is, a program that conjugates verbs. In
English there's not much to do when the verb is "regular" (it follows some model). But in Portuguese
it's a bit different. But don't worry, we'll explain all you need to know in order to learn
how to conjugate regular portuguese verbs.
<p>
First of all, let's learn the pronouns, which you'll use to conjugate the verbs:
<p>

<p>
The "&oacute;" character is represented by ASCII code 243. It doesn't matter how it looks on
your screen, use ASCII character 243 when writing "nós" and "vós"! In Portuguese, all verbs in the infinitive 
mode have one of these sufixes: <B>ar</B> (first conjugations), <B>er</B> (second conjugation) and 
<B>ir</B> (third conjugation). For instance, "amar" (to love) is from the first conjugation, whereas
"correr" (to run) is from the second, and "partir" (to go away) is from the third. So, you can recognize
from which conjugations is the verb by its sufix (of course there are some exceptions to this rules,
but we're not going to handle them). 
<p>
We call "<B>root</B>" the verb in the infinitive mode without the sufix (so, for these three verbs we 
just saw, we have "am", "corr" and "part" as roots). We call the <B>"thematic vowel" </B>
(<B>tv</B> for short) the vowel of the sufix (i.e. "a", "e" or "i").
<p>
To conjugate regular verbs, all you have to do is to find out from which conjugations is the verb and,
then, follow the model for that conjugation. In this problem we are only interested in the "presente
tense", so here are the models for all conjugations on the presente tense:

<p>
So, your task is: given a verb in Portuguese (and its meaning in English), conjugate the verb.

</U></U><H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
There will be two words per line, v1 and v2. The first one (v1) is the verb in Portuguese, 
and the second one (v2) is its meaning in English. All words will be formed by just latin 
lowercase letters (i.e. all letters will lie in the range [a..z]). No word will have more than 30 characters. 
You must read until you reach the end of file.

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
For each pair of words, the first line of output must be:
<PRE>
v1 (to v2)
</PRE>
Where v1 stands for the verb in Portuguese and v2 its meaning in English (as described above).
After that, you must print 6 lines with the correct conjugation, assuming the verb will be
regular. The first character of the pronoun must start at the first column of the line. 
The equivalent conjugation to that pronoun must begin at column 11 of the same line. 
The space between the pronoun and the conjugation must be filled with
blanks. If the verb read lies in none of the conjugations given, 
instead of the conjugation, just print the line
<PRE>
Unknown conjugation
</PRE>
You must print a blank line between the output sets.
