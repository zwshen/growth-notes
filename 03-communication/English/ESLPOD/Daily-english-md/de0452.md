This episode is called “Dealing with Unhappy Employees.”  It’s a dialogue between Asa and Samantha, and it talks about some common  problems that you might have at work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Asa:  I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing employe e complaints.  This has got to be the worst job ever!

Samantha:  This is important work and somebody has to do it.  Come on, let’s get started.

Asa:  I think it’s bad for morale to allow employees to file complaints.  We’re all overworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned ou t.

Samantha:  How else are disgruntled employees going to voice their grievances?

Asa:  Personally, I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.  Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?

Samantha:  I don’t think that’s going to happen.  The  whole point of having this system is to resolve any problems before they get blown ou t of proportion.  It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make this work.

Asa:  On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunction al workplace: Employees thinking of things to complain about and the manageme nt with their backs up against the wall.  I just don’t get it.

 Samantha:  No, I guess you don’t.  If you don’t like ho w things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.

Asa:  What?

Samantha:  File a complaint.

The title of this episode is “Dealing with Unhappy Emp loyees.”  To “deal with” means to take care of a problem, to solve or resolve some s ort of problem.

Asa says, “I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing empl oyee complaints.” To “get stuck with (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning  to be forced to do something that is boring or unpleasant, to have to do something you don’t want to do: “I cooked dinner and my wife got stuck with washing  the dishes.”  Asa is saying that he doesn’t know how they got stuck with “revie wing,” or looking at, employee complaints.  A “complaint” is something negative  that is said or written, and usually comes with an explanation about why someone do esn’t like something.

Asa says, “This has got to be the worst job ever.”  Samant ha says, “This is important work, and somebody has to do it.  Come on, le t’s get started,” she says.  Asa says, “I think it’s bad for morale to allow emplo yees to file complaints.” “Morale” (morale) is the way that a group of people, especially employees, feel about their jobs (their opinions, what they think about  their jobs).  It’s the general feeling that they have.  Morale can either be high or low.  If you say, “My employees have low morale,” you mean they’re not very int erested, they’re not very happy, they’re not very excited.  The opposite would be  high morale.

Asa is saying that it’s bad for morale to have the employe es “file,” or submit (give to the company) their complaints.  He says, “We’re all o verworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned out.”  To be “ov erworked” means to have too much work and to work too hard, making you tired.  We all think that we are overworked, I’m sure!  To be “underpaid” means that you don’t get enough money for the work that you do.  Once again, most people  think that they are overworked and underpaid.  This can cause some people to burn out.  To “burn out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become tired  from having done too much of something for too long.  So, if you continue to  do the same thing year after year and it’s very difficult, you could eventually bu rn out; you could get to the point where you’re too tired to want to continue,  that you’re no longer effective at what you do.

 Samantha says, “How else are disgruntled employees going t o voice their grievances?”  “Disgruntled” means unhappy, disappointed, p erhaps even angry. “To voice” means to express something in words, to say someth ing.  “Voice,” like “burn out,” has different meanings in English; take a l ook at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of both of those terms.   Samantha is saying that she doesn’t know how these upset, angry, disgruntled em ployees are going to “voice their grievances,” are going to tell the company w hat they don’t like.  A “grievance” is like a complaint that is said or written  with an explanation.  Often, it is related to people thinking that there is something unfair or that they haven’t been treated right by their company.

Asa says, “Personally (in my opinion), I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.”  “On paper” just means in writing , written down.  “Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?”   “Retaliation” means revenge, something that you do to hurt another person w ho has hurt you.  So, if I punch you, you could retaliate and punch me back.  Asa is sa ying that if the employees complain, the company could retaliate against t hem – could do something negative, something bad to them.

Samantha says, “I don’t think that’s going to happen.  T he whole point (the main reason) of having this system is to resolve any problems befo re they get blown out of proportion.”  To “resolve” means to solve, to fix or end a problem.  So, they’re trying to fix any problems with the employees befo re they get blown out of proportion.  To “blow (something) out of proportion”  means to make it more important or more serious than it really is or than it has to be.  So, you’re trying to stop the problems when they’re small, before they get t oo big.

Samantha says, “It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make th is work.”  Asa says, “On the contrary,” meaning I think it’s the exact opposi te; I disagree with you.  He says, “On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunctional w orkplace.”  Asa is saying that he thinks it “makes for,” meaning it causes, a dysfunctional workplace.  “Dysfunctional” means not functional; not worki ng properly, especially when people have bad relationships with each ot her.  There’s a popular expression you’ll read or hear about called “th e dysfunctional family.”  It would be a family that doesn’t communicate very well wi th each other, doesn’t have good relationships with each other.  Asa says, “employe es thinking of things to complain about and the management with thei r backs up against the wall.”  Asa is saying this is why it causes a dysfunctional wor kplace, because the employees are thinking of things to complain about and t he managers – the management has their backs up against the wall.  “To have  one’s back up against the wall” means to be in a position where you d on’t have a lot of options

 or choices, that you’re forced to do something without ne cessarily having a lot of flexibility.

Asa says, “I just don’t get it” – I don’t understand.  S amantha says, “No, I guess you don’t (meaning no, you don’t understand).  If you don’t like how things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.”  Asa sa ys, “What?”  Samantha says, “File a complaint.”  Of course, that’s what Asa was co mplaining about: employee complaints.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
