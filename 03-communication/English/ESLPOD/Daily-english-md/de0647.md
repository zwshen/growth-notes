This dialogue is between Hitomi and Jason.  They’re talki ng about using a smartphone.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hitomi:  What are you unboxing?

Jason:  This is my new smartphone.  It has every feature under the sun!

Hitomi:  Every feature?

Jason:  It has a high quality camera and video camera, and  it’s a videophone.  It has a great GPS program, too.  The touch-screen and the keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  Even a child could use it.

Hitomi:  Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensi ve price tag, right?

Jason:  True enough, but it has a removable SIM card and  is Bluetooth compatible.  I can even use it as an e-book reader, and download apps for just about anything I want to do.  No child’s toy could do al l of those things.

Hitomi:  Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.

Jason:  What?

Hitomi:  Can you make a telephone call on it?

Jason:  A telephone call?  You mean a regular phone cal l?  Yes, I think  so.

Hitomi begins by asking Jason, “What are you unboxing?”  “To unbox” (unbox) is to take something that you bought out of the box that i t came in, to open something that is brand new.  This verb is relatively new,  I think.  It became popular when people started filming the unboxing and  putting the video on YouTube, so you could see what was like to buy a new iPho ne or to buy a new Android phone, whatever the thing that you were buying .

Well, Jason is unboxing his new smartphone.  The term “sm artphone” (one word) is a cell phone – a mobile or cellular phone – that can  also do email, usually has an Internet connection, and often other things as well.   The Android is an example of a smartphone; Blackberry makes a number of smar tphones.  The most popular smartphone, or least the most well known, i s probably the iPhone by Apple.  All of these are smartphones.

Jason says that his smartphone has every feature under the su n.  A “feature” is a characteristic, something special about that product.  Our Learning Guides have several features: vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences.  All of those are things that are special, that are included.  Software, a new car, a television – just about anything can have different features – different characteristics.  This smartphone has every feature under the sun.  To say that it “has every (something) under the sun” means it has many different types of that thing; in this case, it has many different features.

So, Jason thinks his smartphone has every feature under the  sun, all of those that you could possibly want.  Hitomi says, “Every feature?”   Jason says, “It has a high quality camera and video camera.”  A “camera” is a d evice that you use, a machine, that takes pictures – that takes photographs.  Th ere are many different, however, uses of that word “camera.”  Take a look at the  Learning Guide for some more of those.  One use is a “video camera,” this is a  camera that records video, obviously.  Jason says that his smartphone is also a vid eophone.  A “videophone” is a telephone that allows you to see the p erson that you are calling.  That is something that, for example, you can d o, I know, on the iPhone with other people who have iPhones.  That’s a videophon e.  Jason says his phone also has a great GPS program.  “GPS” stands for g lobal positioning system.  It’s a technology that allows you to use typically a sa tellite to know exactly where you are, and you can look at a map and see w here you are.  Many cars nowadays have a GPS system in them that will help you f ind your way to wherever you’re going.  This is especially useful if you ar e in a place that you are not familiar with.  Jason says that the phone has a touch- screen and keyboard

 that are easy to use.  A “touch-screen” is a flat panel o f an electronic device that can tell – that senses when you touch it, and allows you to  do different things. Again, many of the Android phones and the iPhone allo w you to use your finger to move something from one side of the screen to the oth er for example, or to “tap” on the screen, to place your finger quickly once or  twice on the screen in order to perform some action.  A “keyboard” is what you use for typing – what you use for putting letters, numbers, punctuation.  It’s what you use on your computer all the time.  I should also mention that “ touch” can be used in a number of different ways, and those can be found in our  Learning Guide as well.

Jason says that the touch-screen and keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  When we say something is “intuitive” (intui tive) we mean it’s very easy for you to understand; you can make sense of it even tho ugh you may not have used it before.  Usually when we say “intuitive,” we mean that it is similar to something else that we do know how to use.  Jason says it is so easy, it is so intuitive to use even a child could use it.  Hitomi says, “ Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensive price tag, right?”  “To afford” me ans to have enough money. The “price tag” (tag) is how much something costs.  Often  when you go into a store, you are looking at for example a new chair or som e other object, you look for the price tag.  You look for the little piece of  paper that says how much it costs.  It can sometimes be used to mean more generally the price.  “So, what’s the price tag on that new car?”  You’re not talking a bout the actual piece of paper – which would probably be called the sticker price, anyway, for a car – you’re talking about what the price is.

Hitomi says that a child would not have enough money – cou ldn’t afford the expensive price tag of the smartphone.  Jason says, “True e nough.”  We use this phrase “true enough” to show that you agree with what another person has said. Often you are agreeing with some sort of perhaps critical  or negative comment, although not always.  Jason says, “True enough, but it ha s a removable SIM card and is Bluetooth compatible.”  A “SIM (SIM) card” is a  subscriber identity module card.  Basically it’s the small card that has your electronic information that you put into a phone to use it.  Many phones have SIM cards yo u can remove and put in a different phone, and sometimes people who tr avel to different countries are getting different SIM cards to use in their phone.   “Bluetooth” is a technology that allows two electronic devices to communicate, to send signals from one to the other.  Bluetooth is a technology that only works for small distances.  For example, I have a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboa rd for my computer. There are no wires that connect the keyboard to the compu ter; it is wireless – without wires – because it is a Bluetooth keyboard.  And we take the keyboard, and we – we use the verb “pair it” with the computer.  Bluetooth devices are paired to each other; they’re connected.  “To be compati ble” means that it can

 use that thing.  So, Bluetooth compatible is a phone t hat can be used with Bluetooth microphones or Bluetooth keyboards, etc.

Jason says, “I can even use (my smartphone) as an e-book reade r, and download apps for just about anything I want to do.”  “E-book” stands for electronic book; an “E-book reader” is a small portable  electronic device that you can use to read text – to read books, magazines, newspapers,  blogs, that sort of thing.  There are lots e-book of readers out there.  T he Kindle by Amazon is a popular one.  Now, the iPad by Apple also has an e-boo k reader on it.  An “app” (app) is an application; it’s a software program that you use, in this case on your smartphone, that allows you to do different things.  Th ere are apps for many, many different functions.  There are ones that you can p lay games on; there are apps that you can use as a map; there are apps that allo w you to translate from one language to another; apps that have the entire di ctionary on them.  So, lots of things you can do with apps.

Jason says, “No child’s toy could do all of those things.”  H itomi says, “Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.”  Jason says, “What?”   Hitomi says, “Can you make a telephone call on it?”  Jason says, “A telephone ca ll?  You mean a regular phone call?  Yes, I think  so.”  He’s not sure.  Of course, we think of cell phones first as being phones, and second as being these ot her things.  But Jason is so excited about the things that his smartphone can  do he doesn’t even talk about the fact that it is also a regular phone.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
