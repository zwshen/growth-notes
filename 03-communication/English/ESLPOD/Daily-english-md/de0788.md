This episode is a dialogue about someone who is con servative, not politically, but someone who doesn’t like to take chances, to be ris ky.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I really don’t think Monty is the right per son for this project.  He’s too conservative in his thinking.  We need someone who’ s a risk taker.

Burt:  Monty will get the job done.  That’s the mos t important thing.

Wendy:  Not if the finished product is staid and bo ring.  Our client won’t be happy with that.

Burt:  Okay, who do you have in mind?

Wendy:  I was thinking of giving the project to Lor enzo.

Burt:  Lorenzo?  Well, he certainly likes to push t he envelope, but he’s also a loose cannon.  Sometimes his ideas pan out and some times they fall flat.

Wendy:  But Lorenzo is bold and daring.  Did you se e what he did on his last project?  It was genius!

Burt:  It was reckless.  It was only through sheer luck that everything worked out. I know that Monty’s ideas are more conventional and  low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.  But, in the end, it’s your call.

Wendy:  In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo.  I’m sure he’ll do a great job.

Burt:  I hope so.  I wouldn’t want us to end up wit h egg on our face.

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Wendy saying to Burt “I re ally don’t think Monty is the right person for this project.  He’s too conservati ve in his thinking.” “Conservative” here means someone who is traditiona l or probably a better way of saying this is it’s someone who doesn’t like to take risks, who’s very careful, who doesn’t like to take chances.  Wendy says, “We need someone who’s a risk taker.”  “Risk” (risk) is sort of like danger; some thing good or bad could happen, you don’t know.  A “risk taker” is someone who will  do things that might not have been tried before, and they may or may not be succe ssful.  It’s sort of the opposite of the conservative person that Wendy does n’t want for this project.

Burt says, “Monty will get the job done (he will co mplete it; he will finish it). That’s the most important thing.”  Wendy says, “Not  if the finished product (the thing that he does, that he accomplishes) is staid and boring.”  “Staid” (staid) means old fashioned, uninteresting; really, it’s the same as “boring.”  Wendy says, “Our client (the person who hired their compa ny; the person who is paying the company) won’t be happy with that.”  Burt says,  “Okay, who do you have in mind?” meaning who are you thinking of for this pro ject.  Wendy says, “I was thinking of giving the project to Lorenzo.”  Burt s ays, “Lorenzo?  Well, he certainly likes to push the envelope.”  The expression “to pu sh the envelope” (envelope) means someone who is a risk taker, someone who goes  to the limits or goes beyond the normal limits of something.  “To push the envelope” would be to do something that no one has done before, but also to do something that is probably somewhat risky, perhaps even dangerous.

Wendy says she wants Lorenzo, but Burt says Lorenzo  is also a loose cannon. A “cannon” (cannon) is a big gun that was more popu lar in, say, the 19 th  century or 18 th centuries.  It’s a big gun; you might find it on a ship, and it, instead of bullets, uses a big, round, ball of metal called a “cannon ball.”  But the expression “loose cannon” means someone who is unpredictable, maybe dangerous, someone you can’t control.  It’s definitely a negat ive way of describing someone. Burt says, “Sometimes his ideas pan out and sometim es they fall flat.”  “To pan (pan) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be  successful, to result as you wanted it to result, to turn out as you intended it  to turn out.  The opposite of “panning out” would be “fall flat.”  “To fall flat”  means to be unsuccessful, or to do something that other people don’t like and therefor e to fail.

Wendy says, “But Lorenzo is bold and daring.”  “To be bold” (bold) means to be brave, to be courageous.  Here, probably, it means someone who’s not afraid to take risks; someone who will do something different , even if other people aren’t

doing it.  “To be daring” is very similar: taking r isks, doing things differently than the way other people do thing, doing something even  when it’s dangerous. That’s daring.  Wendy says, “Did you see what he di d on his last project?  It was genius!”  “Genius” (genius) is very intelligent, ve ry smart, very wise.  It’s a very high compliment.  Here, Wendy means it was intellig ent, but it’s more of a general term to say it was wonderful; it was excell ent.  “It was genius.”

Burt says, “It was reckless (reckless).”  “To be re ckless” is a critical, negative way of describing someone.  It means someone who’s not careful, who’s not paying attention, someone who is perhaps even dangerous.  You can be successful and reckless, but being reckless means that you are not  careful and something bad could happen to you if you have some bad luck.  So if you drive a motorcycle, and you don’t wear a “helmet” on your head, somethi ng to protect your head, that’s reckless.  Although, I guess if you fall off  a motorcycle going at high speeds you’re not going to be in very good shape anyway; i t’s not going to be a happy ending.  But you may save if your life by wearing a  helmet.  Well, not wearing a helmet would be reckless.  Burt thinks that Lorenzo  was a reckless in his last project.  Burt says, “It was only through sheer luc k that everything worked out.” “Sheer” (sheer) here means complete or total.  “It was sheer luck,” it was complete luck, nothing but luck; that’s all it was.   “Sheer” has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for those.

Burt says, “I know that Monty’s ideas are more conv entional and low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.”  “Conventional” means  traditional, standard, nothing unusual, nothing exciting.  “Low-key” (low-key) mea ns calm, not attracting a lot of attention, not very exciting.  Monty’s ideas are co nventional and low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.  This expression “trie d (tried) -and-true (true)” means that they have been tested and shown to be successf ul; we’ve used them before and they work.  Burt says, “in the end, it’s your c all.”  When you say “it’s your call” or “it’s my call” we aren’t talking about a telepho ne call, we’re talking about a decision.  It’s your decision; it’s my decision – i t’s your call; it’s my call.  In sports the “referee,” or the person who decides whether the players have broken the rules or not, has to make a decision, and we call t hat decision a “call” (call), as a noun.

Wendy says, “In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo.”   “I’m going with” here means that’s the person I’m going to hire or that’s the p erson I’m going to use.  In general, “to go with (something)” means I’m making a decision to use this thing or this person.  “To go with” can also mean to actu ally leave with someone: “I’m going to go with my girlfriend to a bar this aftern oon.  Don’t tell my wife.”  I’m kidding, I mean you can tell my wife, ‘cause I actu ally don’t have a girlfriend; it’s just a joke – really!

 Wendy says, “I’m going with Lorenzo.  I’m sure he’l l do a great job.”  Burt says, “I hope so.  I wouldn’t want us to end up with egg on our face.”  “To end up” is a very common phrasal verb in English, it means to be  in a certain situation after you have done a number of different other actions –  after you have followed a plan.  So, “I’m going to work every day for two hou rs for one week, and at the end of one week I hope to end up with a good projec t.”  That’s the situation I want after I finish going through my plan; that’s t he idea of “to end up.”  “To end up” can also mean, simply, to result after certain actions; it can be a negative thing, it could be a positive thing.  “He stole mon ey from his boss, and he ended up in prison.”  That was the result of his actions.   Burt says, “I don’t want us to end up with egg on our face.”  This is an old expre ssion; “to have egg (egg) on your face” means to have made a major mistake and t hen you look stupid; you’re embarrassed because you made a big mistake and ever yone sees it or everyone knows about.  That’s “to end up with egg on your fa ce.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
