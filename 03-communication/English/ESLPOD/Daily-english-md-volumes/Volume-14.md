# Complaining About Parents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,302 – Complaining about Parents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,302. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Winnie and Finn,  who are both complaining about their parents. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Winnie: I can’t believe it. My dad is so clueless.

Finn: What did he do now?

Winnie: He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s party , but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.

Finn: At least he’s letting you go. My mom is so ov erprotective that she won’t let me go to any parties.

Winnie: Unbelievable! Do your parents get on your c ase all the time like mine do?

Finn: Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my ho mework and then complains that I spend too much time by myself in m y room rather than with the family.

Winnie: At least your parents don’t tell you what y ou can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes! What am I, five?

Finn: My parents are worse. They’re always comparin g me to my smarter brothers. I’m a huge disappointment to them. I’m al ways coming up short.

Winnie: My parents are never satisfied either. They ’re always saying that my grades aren’t good enough and my attitude needs imp roving.

Finn: At least your parents don’t embarrass you by fighting all the time, even in public.

 Winnie: We have such hard lives. Nobody understands  us.

Finn: I know. Nobody in history has ever suffered a s much as we have!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Winnie saying, “I can’t believe it.” “I can’t believe it” is something we say when we are surprised or when some thing seems strange to us. Winnie says, “My dad” – my father – “is so clue less.” “To be clueless” (clueless) means not to understand the world around  you, not to be aware of what is happening. Someone who is either not very i ntelligent, not very smart, or who isn’t paying attention could be described as cl ueless, especially when he does something that would indicate he doesn’t under stand what is happening around him.

Finn asks Winnie, “What did he do now?” – what did her father do. Winnie responds, “He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s pa rty, but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.” “Permission” (per mission) is approval to do something or to have something. “Approval” means so meone says, “Yes, you can do that.” Parents may give permission to their children to do certain things. Children, of course, are supposed to “obey” (obey) their parents – that is, do what their parents say. Not all children do that, I  am told.

Winnie has been given permission by her father to g o to Gabi’s party, but she has to return home by 11:00 at night because she ha s a “curfew” (curfew). “Curfew” is a time, usually in the evening, before which you have to be home. Parents often give their children, especially their  teenage children, a curfew – a time at which they must return home so that they do n’t get into trouble. Sometimes a government will have a curfew for its c itizens, telling people they must be at home before a certain time.

Winnie has a curfew of 11 p.m., meaning she must be  back at her house by 11:00 at night. We’re not sure how old Winnie and F inn are, but we’re guessing they are teenagers – somewhere between the ages of,  say, 13 and 17. Finn says, “At least he’s letting you go,” meaning at le ast Winnie’s father is letting her go to this party. “To let someone go” is a phrasal verb meaning to give the person permission or approval.

Finn says, “My mom is so overprotective that she wo n’t let me go to any parties.” “To be protective” of someone means to try to take care of someone, to make sure that a person isn’t hurt in any way. “To be ov erprotective” (overprotective)

means to go too far, to be too protective of someon e, so much so that you are preventing that person perhaps from doing what he w ants to do. The prefix “over” always means too much of something. So, “to overfil l” your glass with water is to put too much water in your glass. “To overprotect” means to protect too much.

Winnie then says, “Unbelievable.” Something that is  “unbelievable” could be something that is impossible to believe. However, W innie is using this word to show how surprised she is by something, especially in a way that indicates that she disapproves or thinks it’s wrong. Winnie says, “Do your parents get on your case all the time like mine do?” “To get on someone ’s case” (case) means to bother someone by telling him all the things he’s d oing wrong. Another term for this is the verb “to nag” (nag), which comes up in the very next sentence.

Winnie that her parents “get on her case all the ti me,” meaning constantly. They’re always criticizing her or telling her what she is doing wrong. Finn says the same thing happens to him. Poor Finn. Finn says , “Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my homework.” “To nag” is similar to “to get on your case,” however, “to nag” usually has the meaning of to be reminding someone all the time about something he is supposed to do.

A wife may “nag” her husband to do the dishes. If t he husband doesn’t do them when she asks him to do them, she may say, “Could y ou please do the dishes now,” and then 10 minutes later, “When are you goin g to do the dishes?” and then 20 minutes later, “How come you haven’t done t he dishes yet?” That would be “to nag.” Of course, a husband can nag a wife as  well, though he won’t remain her husband very long if he does.

In any case, Finn is complaining about his mother n agging him to do his “homework” – that is, the work that he is supposed to do from the classes he takes at school. Finn says his mother nags him to d o his homework and then complains that he spends too much time by himself i n his room.

Finn says his mother “complains.” “To complain” (co mplain) means to show that you are unhappy about something, to say what you do n’t like about a certain person or a certain thing or a situation. Finn’s mo ther complains that Finn spends too much time by himself in his room rather than be ing with his family, although she also tells him he is supposed to do his homewor k. So, he’s a little confused and I understand that.

Winnie says, “At least your parents don’t tell you what you can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes!” Winnie complai ns that her mother “wants to pick out,” or select, or choose her clothing. “To p ick out” is a two-word phrasal

verb meaning to select. She then tries to be funny by saying, “What am I, five?” meaning “Does she think I’m five years old and I ne ed for her to pick out my clothing?”

Finn says, “My parents are worse. They’re always co mparing me to my smarter brothers.” “To compare” means to show how two diffe rent things are similar, although we would sometimes use this also to mean t o show how they are different. Some people use a different verb, “to co ntrast” (contrast), to mean to show how two things are different. “To compare” wou ld mean to show how they are similar, but in conversational English, we ofte n use “to compare” to mean either to show how things are the same or how they are different.

Finn’s parents compare him to his more intelligent or “smarter” brothers. “I’m a huge disappointment to them,” he says. “To be a dis appointment” means to not do as well as someone hopes that you will do, or to  not be as smart, in this case, as your parents hoped that you would be. Many of us  are disappointments to our parents, I’m sure, just as our parents were probabl y disappointments to their parents.

Finn says, “I’m always coming up short.” The expres sion “to come up short” means to disappoint, not to be as good as someone e xpects you to be. It can also mean to get fewer points than you need to win a game. If we say that the Los Angeles Dodgers tried very hard to win their ga me but “came up short,” we mean they didn’t have a high enough score to win the game.

Winnie says, “My parents are never satisfied either .” “To be satisfied” (satisfied) means to be happy. It’s the opposite of “disappoint ed.” It means that you are happy because someone met your expectations. You ar e pleased, or we might say you are “content” (content). Winnie says that h er parents are always saying that her “grades,” her marks at school, “aren’t goo d enough” and that her “attitude needs improving.” “Attitude” (attitude) m eans how you view the world or how you react to things. Teenagers often have a poo r attitude in the minds of their parents.

Finn says, “At least your parents don’t embarrass y ou by fighting all the time, even in public.” Notice that several times in this dialogue, our characters say “at least.” This is often used as a way of introducing a statement that will be even worse than the situation that you just described. F or example, someone may say, “I’m really tired and I have to work all day.” Some one else will say, “Well, at least you get to go home to a nice house when you’re done  working. I have to work all day and I have to go visit my mother-in-law when I’ m done working.” He’s saying that his situation is even worse than your bad situ ation.

 Finn says that his situation is worse than Winnie’s  because his parents “embarrass” him. “To embarrass” (embarrass) means t o make another person feel strange or ashamed or self-conscious. People o ften talk about “being embarrassed,” meaning that they feel strange becaus e they’re in a situation where perhaps they are shown to be unusual or uncom fortable. Finn’s parents embarrass him by fighting, by disagreeing, “even in  public,” meaning when other people they don’t know are around or are present in  the same room.

Winnie says, “We have such hard lives,” meaning we have very difficult lives. “Nobody understands us.” Finn says, “I know. Nobody  in history,” meaning no one ever before this time, “has ever suffered as mu ch as we have.” “To suffer” (suffer) means to experience some pain, either phys ical or in this case emotional. Winnie and Finn, like many teenagers, believe that their lives are the most difficult lives anyone has ever had to live.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Winnie: I can’t believe it. My dad is so clueless.

Finn: What did he do now?

Winnie: He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s party , but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.

Finn: At least he’s letting you go. My mom is so ov erprotective that she won’t let me go to any parties.

Winnie: Unbelievable! Do your parents get on your c ase all the time like mine do?

Finn: Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my ho mework and then complains that I spend too much time by myself in m y room rather than with the family.

Winnie: At least your parents don’t tell you what y ou can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes! What am I, five?

Finn: My parents are worse. They’re always comparin g me to my smarter brothers. I’m a huge disappointment to them. I’m al ways coming up short.

 Winnie: My parents are never satisfied either. They ’re always saying that my grades aren’t good enough and my attitude needs imp roving.

Finn: At least your parents don’t embarrass you by fighting all the time, even in public.

Winnie: We have such hard lives. Nobody understands  us.

Finn: I know. Nobody in history has ever suffered a s much as we have!

# Disputing an Incorrect Bill

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,303 – Disputing an Incorrect Bill.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,303. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com for more information about us. Thi s episode is a dialogue between Regina and Bob about a problem with Bob’s b ill – the indication of how much he should pay a certain company. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Regina: Hello, this is Horizon. My name is Regina. How may I help you today?

Bob: I’m calling to dispute my bill. There’s a bill ing error.

Regina: Let me take a look at your statement. Your last bill was $650 and it is past due.

Bob: It’s past due because this is the third time I ’ve called to report the problem, but my bill still hasn’t been corrected. My bill is  normally $65 a month.

Regina: I’m looking at your account and I don’t see  a record of any previous calls about this problem.

Bob: I called last week and the week before. Look, I just want to get this sorted out so I can pay my bill before my service is disco nnected.

Regina: I understand. Your bill may reflect changes  you’ve made to your usage plan, such as upgrading to a more expensive plan.

Bob: I’ve made no changes to my usage plan. I’ve ha d the same plan for eight months.

Regina: Your bill may also reflect overage charges if you went over your allotted minutes or data.

Bob: I haven’t gone over my limit. Can my case be e scalated so that I can speak with a supervisor?

 Regina: Certainly, sir. Let me have a supervisor ca ll you back when she’s available.

Bob: Will that be today?

Regina: I can’t tell you that, sir.

Bob: I just hope she calls me back before my servic e is [call ends].

[end of dialogue]

Regina that begins our dialogue by saying, “Hello, this is Horizon.” She’s answering the phone, of course. She works for a com pany called “Horizon.” She says, “My name is Regina. How may I help you today? ” Bob says, “I’m calling to dispute my bill. There’s a billing error,” he says.  Your “bill” is usually a piece of paper, though nowadays it could be an email that yo u get from a company, telling you how much you have to pay for some product or se rvice that you buy from that company.

Bob says that there is a problem with his bill. The re is a “billing error” (error). An “error” is a mistake. A “billing error” is a mistak e in the amount of money that the company says you have to pay. Bob is calling “to di spute” (dispute) his bill. “To dispute” means to disagree about something, especia lly when you think there is something wrong. In this case, Bob thinks there’s s omething wrong with his bill, so he’s disputing it. He’s saying “No, that’s wrong , that’s incorrect.” We often use this verb when there are problems with money and the amount of money on a bill.

Regina says, “Let me take a look at your statement. ” A “statement” (statement) here refers to a written report – or again, nowaday s, an electronic report – that shows all of your financial activity over a certain  period of time. For example, many of us have credit cards. Every month, the cred it card company sends us a “statement” which has a list of all the things we b ought with our credit card as well as how much money we paid to the credit card c ompany during that same area of time. That’s a “statement.” Regina is going  to look at Bob’s statement – electronically, of course.

She says, “Your last bill was $650 and it is past d ue.” If a bill is “past (past) due (due),” it is late. It has not been paid on time an d still needs to be paid. We may also use the term “overdue” (overdue). A bill that is “overdue” or “past due” is a bill that has not been paid on time. So if you have  to pay your rent on the first of

the month, and you don’t pay it for five days or 10  days, the rent is “overdue.” It’s past due. You are late.

Bob says that his bill is “past due because,” he ex plains, “this is the third time I’ve called to report the problem, but my bill still has n’t been corrected.” Bob says yes, my bill is past due, but that’s because there’s a p roblem with it, and I have called to report it but it has not been corrected. “To rep ort” (report) means to give someone information about something. It’s often use d to mean to officially notify someone.

“To notify” (notify) means to tell someone, but usu ally in a formal way or in a way that is used, say, in a business or governmental si tuation. You “notify” the government that you are not going to pay your taxes  this year, and the government notifies you that you will be going to j ail. That’s how it works here in the U.S. sometimes.

Bob reported a problem to this company that has not  been corrected – that is, it hasn’t been fixed. There’s an error that is still p resent on his bill. He says normally his bill is $65 dollars a month, not $650,  which is what the company says it is. Regina says, “I’m looking at your accou nt and I don’t see a record of any previous calls about this problem.” A “previous  call” would be a phone call that Bob made in the past.

Regina says she doesn’t see a “record” (record) of any previous calls. A record would be some written detailed information, probabl y in the computer system of the company, showing that Bob, in fact, called. Bob  says, “I called last week and the week before.” Then he says, “Look, I just want to get this sorted out so I can pay my bill before my service is disconnected.”

The use of the word “Look” (look) in this sentence is to get someone’s attention. In conversational English, if we want a person to p ay attention, perhaps because he hasn’t been listening very closely up to this po int, we might say, “Look.” We might also say, “Listen.” They mean the same thing,  even though of course “look” is something you do with your eyes, and “listen” is  something you do with your ears. The point is that we’re not saying they shoul d actually look with their eyes, but rather that they should listen to what you’re s aying.

Bob says, “Look, I just want to get this sorted out .” “To sort (sort) out” something, in this case, means to fix the problem, to take car e of this situation, to find a solution to the problem. “To sort out” can also mea n to take a group of things and put them in different categories. But here, “to sor t out” means to get fixed. Bob

wants to sort out this problem. Why? Because he doe sn’t want his service with this company, whatever this company does for him, “ to be disconnected.”

It sounds like Horizon is a phone company, no relat ion to an actual phone company here in the United States called “Verizon.”  No relation at all. The service that Bob gets, we’re guessing his telephone  service, “may get disconnected.” “To disconnect” (disconnect) means t o stop providing service to someone. We usually use this verb “to connect” and the opposite, “to disconnect,” when we’re talking about telephone ser vice. If your telephone service gets “disconnected,” you no longer have it.  The company will no longer provide you that service.

Regina says, “I understand. Your bill may reflect c hanges you made to your usage plan, such as upgrading to a more expensive p lan.” Regina is saying that, in effect, Bob is wrong. She says that perhaps the bill, that has a much higher cost than Bob says it should, just “reflects change s” he’s made to his usage plan. “To reflect” (reflect) means to show or to indicate  or to result from. Regina is saying that perhaps Bob made changes to his “usage (usage) plan.”

Your “usage plan” is an agreement you have with you r phone company about how many minutes you’re going to use every month, h ow much time you’re going to talk on your phone, or how much data you’re goin g to use. “Data” would refer to using the internet on a smartphone or an app. “T o upgrade (upgrade) to a more expensive plan” means to go from using, say, f ive hours of time every month, to 10 hours of time every month, or from usi ng one gigabyte of data to two gigabytes of data.

Many phone companies, especially cell phone compani es, have the option of upgrading plans, meaning you can get more service b y paying more money. That’s what Regina is suggesting happened to Bob – that he upgraded his plan and that’s why it’s costing him more money. But Bob  says no, no, no. “I’ve made no changes to my usage plan. I’ve had the same plan  for eight months,” he says.

Regina says, “Your bill may also reflect overage ch arges if you went over your allotted minutes or data.” In the U.S., if you talk  too much on your cell phone or you use too much data on your smartphone, you may h ave to pay extra money. That’s called “overage (overage) charges (charges). ” “Overage” means you’ve used too much. You’ve gone over your limit.

Every month, most people are allotted a certain num ber of minutes or a certain amount of data. “To allot” (allot) means to give so meone a certain amount of something. We say that you are “allotted” a certain  number of minutes or data on

your phone by the phone company. They give you a ce rtain amount that you can use. Bob complains, however, that he has not gone o ver his limit – the maximum amount that he can use. “Can my case be escalated s o that I can speak with a supervisor?” he asks.

When you are talking to a company, usually the firs t person you talk to works for the company but may not have a lot of power to chan ge things, especially if you are disputing your bill. That’s why Bob asks for hi s “case,” meaning his problem, “to be escalated” (escalated). “To escalate” nowada ys means to have your complaint given to someone with more authority or m ore power in the company.

I don’t remember this verb when I was growing up to  be used in this case, but nowadays, especially when a lot of what we call “cu stomer service” – where a company takes care of problems for customers or cli ents – is done over the telephone, we now have this verb of “escalating a p roblem” – making someone responsible for it who has more power than the firs t person you talk to in a company.

Usually after talking to the first person who answe rs the phone, you are given to someone with more authority, someone called a “supe rvisor” (supervisor). A “supervisor” is a manager or a boss, someone who is  responsible for other people and someone for whom you would want to ask i f you have a problem that the first person you talk to can’t solve.

Regina says, “Certainly, sir. Let me have a supervi sor call you back when she’s available.” In other words, Regina will take down B ob’s name and number, write it down, and give it to a supervisor so that the su pervisor can call Bob back. Bob asks, “Will that be today?” meaning “Will she call me today?” Regina says, “I can’t tell you that, sir,” meaning probably she doe sn’t know.

Bob says, “I just hope she calls me back before my service is” – and then suddenly the phone call, the conversation between R egina and Bob, ends. The idea here of course, and the joke, is that Bob’s ph one service has ended because he hasn’t paid his bill. We know he hasn’t paid his bill because of a problem that Horizon apparently has made with his b ill or has caused, and now he doesn’t have phone service so that the superviso r won’t be able to talk to him after all. This, of course, is the worst possible c ase for poor Bob.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Regina: Hello, this is Horizon. My name is Regina. How may I help you today?

Bob: I’m calling to dispute my bill. There’s a bill ing error.

Regina: Let me take a look at your statement. Your last bill was $650 and it is past due.

Bob: It’s past due because this is the third time I ’ve called to report the problem, but my bill still hasn’t been corrected. My bill is  normally $65 a month.

# Expressing Gratitude

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,304 – Expressing Gratitude.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,304. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Mark and Gina ab out thanking someone or simply being thankful for the good things you have.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gina: I would like to begin by expressing my gratit ude to all the people who have helped me along the way . . .

Mark: You’re not going to start your speech with th at boring opening, are you?

Gina: It’s not boring. It’s a nice opening.

Mark: It’s too formal and stiff. How about, “Hey, e verybody. Thanks a million!”

Gina: That’s too informal.

Mark: Fine, if you say so. What comes next?

Gina: Well, then I say, “I want to wholeheartedly t hank those who stuck with us and who never let us down.”

Mark: That’s too impersonal. How about, “Hey Emilia no, you’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab.

Gina: That doesn’t even come close to expressing ho w I feel. I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, generosity, and su pport from the bottom of my heart.

Mark: That’s so sappy! Why don’t you just give prop s to people who deserve it and a shout-out to the people who helped you? Then,  you jump off the stage and walk through the audience to high-five everybody. T hat’s how I would give a thank-you speech.

Gina: I’ll remember that the next time I speak to a  group of 10-year-olds!

[end of dialogue]

Gina begins our dialogue by saying to Mark, “I woul d like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all the people who have helped me a long the way.” “To express” (express) your thoughts, or feelings, or emotions i s to show them or display them, or perhaps do something to let someone know w hat your thoughts or feelings are. The term “gratitude” (gratitude) mean s a feeling of thankfulness, of being happy that something good has happened to you  and specifically being thankful to another person or perhaps a situation t hat has given you these good things.

Nowadays people talk about “gratitude” as being thi s feeling of thankfulness or this idea of thanking someone for the good things t hat have happened to them. Logically, you have to be thankful to someone, but many people talk about gratitude in a, I guess you might say, “impersonal sense,” or a way that doesn’t necessarily imply a specific person giving them cer tain things. People say, “I am grateful for this” or “I am grateful for that.” “Gr ateful” (grateful) means being thankful for something. We often don’t say to whom we are grateful.

In any case, Gina is expressing her gratitude to a certain group of people. She’s actually thanking the people who have helped her “a long the way.” “Along the way” is an expression meaning over a period of time , or as you are trying to reach a certain goal or a certain point in your lif e. Mark interrupts Gina, who it seems is practicing a speech – a talk that she’s go ing to be giving to a group of people. He says, “You’re not going to start your sp eech with that boring opening, are you?”

Mark thinks that Gina’s “opening,” the beginning of  her speech, is “boring” – not interesting. Gina disagrees. She says, “It’s not bo ring. It’s a nice,” or good, “opening.” Mark says, “It’s too formal and stiff.” “Stiff” (stiff) here means not relaxed, not normal, something that you say that is  perhaps not appropriate for the situation, perhaps even not sincere – that is, you don’t really mean it.

Mark suggests a more informal beginning to the spee ch. He says, “How about,” meaning why don’t you try this, “Hey, everybody. Th anks a million!” The expression, “Thanks a million” (million) is an info rmal phrase meaning thank you very much, or perhaps thank you a million times, me aning I really thank you. Gina says, “That’s too informal.” Mark says, “Fine,  if you say so.” Notice that expression “if you say so” is often used when you d on’t want to argue with the other person, but you don’t agree with him either.

 Mark says, “What comes next?” meaning what’s the ne xt part or the next sentence in the speech. He’s asking Gina to continu e her speech. Gina says, “Well, then I say, ‘I want to wholeheartedly thank those who stuck with us and never let us down.’” “Wholeheartedly” (wholehearted ly) means completely or entirely. It is often said when we are talking abou t things that we feel very deeply or that we have a strong emotion attached to. “I wa nt to wholeheartedly thank you” means I want to thank you really and sincerely , and with a lot of emotion.

Gina wants to wholeheartedly thank those people who  “stuck with them.” “To stick (stick) with” someone is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to support someone or to stay with someone, to be loyal to som eone even when times are difficult, even when the situation is difficult. “S tuck” is the past tense of the verb “stick.” That’s why Gina says, “Those who stuck wit h us,” meaning who were there with us in the past when bad things happened to us, when the situation was difficult. “And” – she also wants to thank – “those  who never let us down.”

The phrasal verb “to let someone down” or “to let d own” someone here means to disappoint someone – not to do what someone was exp ecting you to do. Mark doesn’t like this line in Gina’s speech, this sente nce. He says, “That’s too impersonal.” “Impersonal” (impersonal) means distan t, without feelings of warmth or closeness, or simply not being emotional enough.  Mark says, “How about” – once again, why don’t you try – “‘Hey Emiliano, you ’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab.’”

Mark suggests speaking much more informally, includ ing using something such as “Hey.” “Hey” is a way of getting someone’s atten tion, but it’s very informal. “Hey Emiliano, you’re totally,” or your completely,  “awesome” (awesome). “Awesome” nowadays is an informal way of saying fan tastic, great, wonderful, or perhaps cool. Mark suggests also that Gina say, “An d you, Tanya? You’re absolutely fab (fab).” “Fab” is short for “fabulous ” (fabulous), which in this context means the same as awesome, fantastic, great, wonder ful.

Gina says, “That doesn’t even come close to express ing how I would feel.” She thinks that Mark suggestions don’t express her emot ions properly. She says, “I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, gene rosity, and support from the bottom of my heart.” “Thoughtfulness” refers to som eone always thinking about another person, always considering that person, mak ing sure that person is happy.

“Generosity” comes from the word “generous” (genero us). “To be generous” means to give money or time to other people so that  those people who need it

have the help they need. If I’m “generous,” I’m giv ing you a lot of something – more than I have to, perhaps. Gina wants to thank p eople for being thoughtful, generous, and supporting her.

She wants to do all of this from the bottom of her heart (heart). Doing something “from the heart” means doing it from a very deep em otion, or doing it sincerely. “From the bottom of your heart” means that you real ly mean it. You are expressing some very deep emotion, something that y ou want the person to understand as very sincere. You really mean it.

Mark disagrees. He says that what Gina is saying is  “sappy” (sappy). “Sappy” means with too much emotion, so much emotion that i t seems exaggerated and perhaps insincere, not meaningful. He says, “Why do n’t you just give props to people who deserve it?” “To give props” (props) to someone is to recognize someone who has helped you, to recognize someone wh o has done something good, perhaps.

It’s an informal expression, “to give props to.” Yo u’ll sometimes hear that when a rock star or perhaps a young actor is accepting an award. This happens very frequently here in Los Angeles, here in Hollywood, where people love to give each other awards for things. Someone will go up in  front of the audience the people watching the award show and say, “I want to give props to” a certain person. They’re thanking that person for something that person perhaps has done. They’re “giving credit to” that person becaus e they respect that person.

Mark also says that Gina should just “give a shout- out to the people who have helped.” That’s another informal expression you wil l sometimes hear younger people use. A “shout- out” means I’m saying “hello”  to. A “shout (shout) – out (out)” is an informal expression, to be sure. “To g ive a shout out” is the expression, actually.

Mark says that then Gina should jump off the stage and walk through the audience “to high-five everybody.” “To high (high) – five (five)” someone is to put your hand up as they put their hand up, their arm i n the air, and you hit each other’s hand. You hit their hand, or his hand or he r hand, as a way of showing excitement or as a way, in this case, of thanking t he people. Mark is suggesting a very unusual, informal way of thanking people.

Gina says, “I’ll remember that,” meaning I will thi nk of your advice, “the next time I speak to a group of 10-year-olds!” Gina is sort o f making a joke here. She’s saying that what Mark is suggesting is more appropr iate for giving a speech to a

group of children rather than to adults because of the informal ways that Mark is suggesting Gina deliver her speech.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gina: I would like to begin by expressing my gratit ude to all the people who have helped me along the way . . .

Mark: You’re not going to start your speech with th at boring opening, are you?

Gina: It’s not boring. It’s a nice opening.

Mark: It’s too formal and stiff. How about, “Hey, e verybody. Thanks a million!”

Gina: That’s too informal.

Mark: Fine, if you say so. What comes next?

Gina: Well, then I say, “I want to wholeheartedly t hank those who stuck with us and who never let us down.”

Mark: That’s too impersonal. How about, “Hey Emilia no, you’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab.

Gina: That doesn’t even come close to expressing ho w I feel. I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, generosity, and su pport from the bottom of my heart.

Mark: That’s so sappy! Why don’t you just give prop s to people who deserve it and a shout-out to the people who helped you? Then,  you jump off the stage and walk through the audience to high-five everybody. T hat’s how I would give a thank-you speech.

Gina: I’ll remember that the next time I speak to a  group of 10-year-olds!

# Saying a Final Goodbye

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,305 – Saying a Final Goodbye.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,305. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Lucy and me abou t saying goodbye. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: I don’t know how to say goodbye.

Jeff: How about so long, I’m outta here, “I’m leavi ng on a jet plane” and “in 10 minutes I’ll be late for the door”?

Lucy: No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that it’s hard to say goodbye to something after such a long time. I’ve had a very h appy time here.

Jeff: What you really mean to say is, “Parting is s uch sweet sorrow.” But, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have lo ved at all.” “I, I, will always love you.”

Lucy: Stop! Listen, what I want to express is a fon d farewell and optimism for the future.

Jeff: Ah, okay! Then you should say: Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life! I’m off to bigger and better things! I’m blow ing this pop stand!

Lucy: No, no, no. That’s not right at all. I want t o end with some meaningful parting words, something sincere, something from my  heart.

Jeff: Like, “May the force be with you”?

Lucy: Hmm . . . how about “Live long and prosper”?

Jeff: Now are you ready to leave?

Lucy: I guess so. It’s been a blast.

 Jeff: It’s been a hoot.

Lucy: It’s been an honor and a pleasure.

Jeff: Adiós.

Lucy: Au revoir.

Jeff: Sayonara.

Lucy: Zàijiàn. Zoi gin.

Jeff: Ciao.

Lucy: Auf Wiedersehen.

Jeff: Proshchay.

Lucy: Tchau.

Jeff: Wadaeaan.

Lucy: Annyeong.

Jeff: Toodle loo!

Lucy & Jeff: Thank you and goodbye.

[end of dialogue]

Lucy begins our dialogue by saying, “I don’t know h ow to say goodbye.” I then give her some suggestions, some informal expression s that we might use in English to say goodbye. These are all informal, def initely not things that you would say in normal conversation, in a formal setti ng. The first one, however, I guess you could say in a formal or informal setting , and that is “so long.” “So long” is one way of saying goodbye.

Another much more informal way of saying goodbye is  “I am outta here.” “I am outta (outta) here” is something of an abbreviated way of saying, “I am out of here.” “To be out of here” is a way of saying “I’m leaving quickly,” often because I no longer want to be here, though that isn’t always  the case. If someone says,

“I’m outta here,” he may be saying, “This is a bad situation and I no longer want to be here.” Said in a different context, perhaps i n a different way, it just means goodbye. If you are, for example, talking to a frie nd and you look at your clock and you realize you have to get home now, you say, “Well, I’m outta here. I gotta get home.” I have to return to my house.

The next two expressions that I use are from songs,  really, and they are expressions of saying goodbye or of leaving from a couple of different popular songs. One of them is “I’m leaving on a jet (jet) p lane.” This comes from an old song called, appropriately enough, “I’m Leaving on a Jet Plane.” It was a song sung by the folk group back in the 1960s, Peter, Pa ul, and Mary.

I’m leaving on a jet plane don’t know when I’ll be back again

It would be a very unusual way of saying goodbye, b ut it’s possible in a joking way, especially if you are about to leave on a plan e. A “jet plane” is really just another word for an airplane here. “In 10 minutes I ’ll be late for the door” is another suggestion I give, and once again this come s from a popular song from my youth, a song by the rock group Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, who I actually saw in concert when I was in high school. Yeah. I’m that old.

The song was called “Old Time Rock and Roll” and wa s made famous in the movie that starred a young Tom Cruise called Risky Business. “In 10 minutes, I’ll be late for the door.” “To be late for the door” me ans that I will be out of the door – that is, I will be leaving. However, again, it’s not something that you would normally say in order to say goodbye, but to someon e of a certain age – my age – you might say it as a joke, knowing the other per son would recognize it as a line from the song. The person would understand it means that you are saying goodbye.

Lucy says, however, “No, that’s not what I mean.” I  was giving her expressions used in situations when you are leaving temporarily  – say, in the morning or after work. Lucy was referring to something more permanen t. She says, “I mean that it’s hard to say goodbye to something after such a long time.” She’s referring to perhaps leaving one’s job or saying goodbye to a ce rtain situation such as writing dialogues, for example, for English lessons. “I’ve had a very happy time here,” she says.

I respond by saying, “What you really mean to say i s, ‘Parting is such sweet sorrow.’” “Parting is such sweet sorrow” is a well- known or famous line, phrase, spoken by one of the actors – one of the characters , I should say – in the

Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. It’s used someti mes now, almost as a joke, to say that it is sad to say goodbye.

The original line in the play means that saying goo dbye is sad. That’s why it is a “sorrow” (sorrow). “Sorrow” refers to sadness, but it is a “sweet (sweet) sorrow.” It’s sweet because we think about the good times we ’ve had together. “Parting” comes from the verb “to part” (part), which here me ans to separate – when two people have to say goodbye to each other. That’s wh ere we get this expression, then, “Parting is such sweet sorrow.”

Then I use another famous sentence, “It’s better to  have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” This is also, as I men tioned, a famous line, a famous sentence, this time from a poem that was written by  the great British poet Alfred Lord Tennyson. It’s an adaptation, really, from his  poem “In Memoriam A. H. H.” It means that it’s painful to end a relationship, e specially a romantic relationship, but it is better to have loved someone and then los e that person than never to have actually loved the person, or to love anyone, I suppose, in general.

“It’s better to have loved and lost,” meaning lost the person you loved, “than never to have loved at all.” I’m trying to be funny  in the dialogue, as I usually do. I’m using these famous expressions, these famous li nes from poems and plays, in order to express this feeling of saying goodbye.  Then I take a line from a famous song by the singer Dolly Parton. It was reco rded most famously by Whitney Houston in 1992 for a really terrible movie  called The Bodyguard, but anyway, the line is “I will always love you, will a lways love you.” (I had to do that.)

Lucy then says, “Stop!” I, of course, am making fun  and she’s trying to be a little serious. She says, “Listen,” meaning pay attention to me. “What I want to express is a fond farewell and optimism for the fut ure.” “To express” means to communicate. A “fond (fond) farewell (farewell)” is  a sweet, kind, emotional goodbye. Something that people would give to each o ther when they like each other.

“Farewell” is another way of saying goodbye. A “far ewell” is a goodbye. “Fond” is something that is kind, something that you really m ean. “Optimism” (optimism) is a positive view of the future, a belief that things  will be better in the future, a hopefulness. Lucy wants to express a “fond farewell  and optimism for the future.”

I say, “Ah, okay! Then you should say” – and I give  another common expression – “Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life .” This is an expression sometimes people use when they are trying to be pos itive about their future.

“Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life” – unless of course you die today, in which case tomorrow is not anything.

I then say, “I’m off to bigger and better things!” “I’m off to” means I am leaving now to go on to bigger and better things, a better situation. Then I use a third expression which is quite different and is actually  an informal way of saying goodbye sometimes, “I’m blowing this pop stand!” “T o blow this pop (pop) stand (stand)” means that you are leaving a place. You ar e saying goodbye to everyone, probably because you think the place you are in is boring or the situation you are in is unpleasant, one that isn’t very exciting, one that makes you want to leave.

A “stand” is a small store, often outside, where yo u sell things from. You might sell things such as soda pop, and hence the express ion “pop stand.” People also nowadays say, “Oh, I’m going to blow this popsicle stand,” or “Let’s blow this popsicle stand.” A “popsicle” is a frozen dessert, basically sugar water that has been frozen. So, “I’m blowing this pop stand,” or i f you say to someone else, “Let’s blow this popsicle stand,” are both ways of saying that you are now leaving this place because it’s too boring or too unexcitin g for you.

Lucy says, “No, no, no. That’s not right at all. I want to end with some meaningful parting words, something sincere, something from my  heart.” “Parting words” would be words you say when you are leaving someone . “To be sincere” (sincere) means to express your true emotions, your  true feelings, your real thoughts without hiding anything. Lucy wants to exp ress something from her heart, emotionally, meaningfully.

I then say, “Like,” meaning for example, “‘May the force be with you?’” “May the force (force) be with you” is a well-known line fro m, of course, the Star Wars movies, used in general to mean good luck or I hope  you will be successful. Lucy then uses another famous line from another science fiction movie or TV series, “Live long and prosper.” “To prosper” (prosper) mea ns to be successful, often financially or economically successful at what you do. This is a famous line from the character Spock in the Star Trek TV shows and m ovies.

Then I say to Lucy, “Now are you ready to leave?” L ucy says, “I guess so.” “I guess so” means yes, but it’s said when either you’ re not sure or perhaps you’re not very enthusiastic about something. She says, ho wever, “It’s been a blast” (blast). A “blast” is a great time, a lot of fun, a  lot of excitement. I then say, “It’s been a hoot” (hoot). A “hoot” is something that is fun, enjoyable, entertaining. It’s an old word, an old expression. We don’t use it muc h anymore other than to be funny because it is such an old expression. “It’s b een a hoot.”

 Lucy says, “It’s been an honor and a pleasure.” An “honor” is something that you believe is like a gift to you. You’ve had the abili ty to do something because someone has given you that ability, someone has giv en you permission to do something or has given something to you almost as i f it were a gift. Lucy says, “It’s been an honor and a pleasure.” I think she me ans making these lessons, but in general it’s something you could say if you have  been happy to do something.

Then Lucy and I give a number of ways of saying goo dbye in different languages. I won’t repeat those here. I do say one thing in En glish using another very old way of saying goodbye, which is “Toodle loo!” “Tood le (toodle) loo (loo)” is a funny, informal way saying goodbye nowadays. It’s a ctually taken from a French word, but it is a very, we would call, “corrupt” pr onunciation. “Toodle loo” is just a funny way of saying goodbye.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: I don’t know how to say goodbye.

Jeff: How about so long, I’m outta here, “I’m leavi ng on a jet plane” and “in 10 minutes I’ll be late for the door”?

Lucy: No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that it’s hard to say goodbye to something after such a long time. I’ve had a very h appy time here.

Jeff: What you really mean to say is, “Parting is s uch sweet sorrow.” But, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have lo ved at all.” “I, I, will always love you.”

Lucy: Stop! Listen, what I want to express is a fon d farewell and optimism for the future.

Jeff: Ah, okay! Then you should say: Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life! I’m off to bigger and better things! I’m blow ing this pop stand!

Lucy: No, no, no. That’s not right at all. I want t o end with some meaningful parting words, something sincere, something from my  heart.
