On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Raphael and Kelly about spending too much money. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raphael: Sorry to be a buzzkill, but this gravy tra in we’ve been on is about to end.

Kelly: What do you mean?

Raphael: There have been a lot of complaints about our department’s spending on extraneous things, and to quell the masses, the department head is making some major changes.

Kelly: Like what?

Raphael: Like no more frivolous and excessive spend ing on travel and entertainment at conferences.

Kelly: But those are the only things that make this  job bearable. Those perks are part and parcel of working for a government agency – at least that’s what I used to think.

Raphael: Well, once the press got wind of some of o ur spending practices, they started to question our budget allocations. The lon g and short of it is that those days are about to end.

Kelly: And I was planning to take you and few other  employees to St. Lucia for a retreat in the spring.

 Raphael: I think you’d better change those plans, a t least the venue. You’d have better luck getting it approved if you picked Cleve land!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Raphael saying to Kelly, “ Sorry to be a buzzkill.” A “buzzkill” (buzzkill) is a person who spoils or rui ns everyone else's fun. Basically, a “buzzkill” is a person who does something to stop  other people from having fun while they're in the middle of having fun. They do something or say something that makes everyone no longer enjoy themselves. Tha t's a “buzzkill.” There's an older term, a little less common nowadays, for this  same idea, which is a “party pooper” (pooper). A “party pooper” is the same as a  buzzkill. The word “buzz” is sometimes used to mean excitement – a certain atmos phere in a situation or place. That's probably the origin of this term “buz zkill.”

Raphael says he's sorry to be a buzzkill, “but this  gravy train we've been on is about to end.” “Gravy (gravy) train (train)” is a s ituation where you have a lot of money, or people are able to make a lot of money ve ry easily. A gravy train would be a really good situation financially – some thing either that is making you a lot of money or that is allowing you to spend a l ot of money. Raphael talks about being on a gravy train just like you would be  on a regular train or on a bus or another form of transportation. Unfortunately, the gravy train “is about to end,” R aphael says.

Kelly says, “What do you mean?” He says, “There hav e been a lot of complaints about our department's spending on extraneous thing s.” A “complaint” is an objection to something that is going on that you do n't like. You can have a complaint at a restaurant if your food is bad. Here , people are complaining – notice the verb “to complain” – “about our departme nt’s spending on extraneous things.” “Spending” is the money that you pay for s omething. “Extraneous” (extraneous) means extra and unnecessary. Something  that is “extraneous” is something that is more than what is needed. It's to o much. It's not required.

Raphael and Kelly's department has been spending mo ney on extraneous things, “and to quell the masses, the department head is ma king some major changes.” The “department head” would be the person who is the top boss, top manager, in a department in a company. A “department” is just o ne part of a larger company – one division, perhaps, of a company. The departme nt head is making some major, or very important or large, changes.

He's doing this “to quell the masses.” This is an i nteresting expression. “To quell (quell) the masses (masses)” means to try to make p eople feel calmer, to try to do things that will address or answer people's conc erns or complaints. The “masses” refers to a large group of people. “To que ll” here means to quiet down, to make happy, people who are unhappy because of a bad situation.

Kelly says, “Like what?” meaning “What are these ma jor changes?” Raphael says, “Like no more frivolous and excessive spendin g on travel and entertainment at conferences.” Something that is “f rivolous” (frivolous) is not very important, silly. Something that is “frivolous” is not worth paying close attention to. “Excessive” means too much. This department has  been spending too much on travel and entertainment at conferences. A “conf erence” is a large meeting where people who have similar interests come togeth er and talk to each other.

Many kinds of work have conferences where once a ye ar or perhaps twice a year you can go and learn more about your particular are a. It might be a business conference. It might be an academic conference with  university professors. It might be a conference for people who work in the go vernment. There are conferences all over the United States – all over the world – for lots of different kinds of interests and activities. In fact, in most  cities in the United States – in most big cities in the United States – you will fin d “conference centers.” These are places that are built especially for these kind s of large group meetings.

Kelly says, “But those are [the only] things that make this job bearable.” “To be bearable” (bearable) means to be tolerable – someth ing that you can put up with. Something that is “bearable” is something that is n ot so terrible that you want to quit or stop doing whatever it is you're doing. Kel ly says that going to these conferences, for example, is one of the things that  makes her job “bearable.” It might not be a very good job, but it's okay because  she can go to these conferences and spend a lot of money. That's kind of how I felt about my university job.

Kelly says, “Those perks are part and parcel of wor king for a government agency – at least that's what I used to think.” A “perk” ( perk) is a benefit, especially a benefit from working at a certain place from your j ob. It might be something like free parking at the building, or you get a free lun ch every day. There are companies here in California that give their employ ees lunch for free every day. It's one of the perks of the job. Of course, they d o that so that people will stay in the building and work more.

Kelly says these perks are “part and parcel” (parce l). “Part and parcel” is an old expression meaning a necessary part of something – something that you have to

do or something that cannot be avoided. We learned that Kelly and Raphael work for the government, which is why they have so much money to spend. Raphael says, “Well, once the press got wind of some of our  spending practices, they started to question our budget allocations.” The “p ress” here refers to the media: newspapers, magazines, television stations, and so forth – people who work in the area of journalism, of reporting the news.

“To get wind of something” is an expression that me ans to find out about, to hear about something. “Spending practices” just refers to the things that you spend money on, the way that you spend your money. “Budge t allocations” refers to your plans about how you're going to spend your mon ey. A “budget” (budget) is a plan for spending money. “Allocations” are the thin gs that you actually spend the money on. The press got wind of the spending practi ces of this department and they “started to question” – they started to ask qu estions about and to complain about, really, these budget allocations.

Raphael says, “The long and the short of it is that  those days are about to end.” “The long and the short of it” is a phrase we use to give someone the most important point about a difficult or complex situat ion. It's a way of introducing the conclusion or the most important thing you want to say to someone. If you're telling someone a long, complicated story, you may try to summarize everything by saying, “The long and short of it is . . .”

Kelly says, “And I was planning to take you and a f ew other employees to St. Lucia for a retreat in the spring.” St. Lucia is an  island in the Caribbean. A “retreat” (retreat) is usually a long meeting that you have outside of your offices, at a hotel or at a very nice resort somewhere away from where you work. Usually, a retreat lasts two or three days, and it' s a time for leaders in a company or an organization to come together and talk about their plans for the future. That's a typical topic at a retreat.

There are also religious retreats were people go aw ay for a couple of days in order to pray and participate in religious activiti es. But Kelly isn’t thinking of anything religious here when she talks about this r etreat, since St. Lucia is one of the most expensive islands to go to in the Caribbea n. Raphael says, “I think you'd better change those plans, at least the venue .” The “venue” (venue) is the place where some event is held. It’s the location w here you, in this case, would be having your meeting.

Raphael says, “You'd have better luck getting it ap proved if you picked Cleveland.” Raphael is saying to Kelly that she wil l have a better chance of getting her plan approved to have a retreat if she has it in Cleveland rather than

St. Lucia. Cleveland is a city in the eastern part of the United States, in the state of Ohio. The reason that Raphael says Cleveland is that it's not a very nice city to visit. I’ve been to Cleveland. It seems okay. But it's not a place where people would go in order to have a vacation, and a lot of times these retreats are places that are nice, that are places where you would go o n a vacation, like Hawaii or St. Lucia.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
