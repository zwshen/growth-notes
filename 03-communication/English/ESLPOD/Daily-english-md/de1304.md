Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,304 – Expressing Gratitude.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,304. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

This episode is a dialogue between Mark and Gina ab out thanking someone or simply being thankful for the good things you have.  Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Gina: I would like to begin by expressing my gratit ude to all the people who have helped me along the way . . . 

Mark: You’re not going to start your speech with th at boring opening, are you? 

Gina: It’s not boring. It’s a nice opening. 

Mark: It’s too formal and stiff. How about, “Hey, e verybody. Thanks a million!” 

Gina: That’s too informal.  

Mark: Fine, if you say so. What comes next? 

Gina: Well, then I say, “I want to wholeheartedly t hank those who stuck with us and who never let us down.” 

Mark: That’s too impersonal. How about, “Hey Emilia no, you’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab. 

Gina: That doesn’t even come close to expressing ho w I feel. I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, generosity, and su pport from the bottom of my heart. 

Mark: That’s so sappy! Why don’t you just give prop s to people who deserve it and a shout-out to the people who helped you? Then,  you jump off the stage and walk through the audience to high-five everybody. T hat’s how I would give a thank-you speech. 

Gina: I’ll remember that the next time I speak to a  group of 10-year-olds! 

[end of dialogue] 

Gina begins our dialogue by saying to Mark, “I woul d like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all the people who have helped me a long the way.” “To express” (express) your thoughts, or feelings, or emotions i s to show them or display them, or perhaps do something to let someone know w hat your thoughts or feelings are. The term “gratitude” (gratitude) mean s a feeling of thankfulness, of being happy that something good has happened to you  and specifically being thankful to another person or perhaps a situation t hat has given you these good things.  

Nowadays people talk about “gratitude” as being thi s feeling of thankfulness or this idea of thanking someone for the good things t hat have happened to them. Logically, you have to be thankful to someone, but many people talk about gratitude in a, I guess you might say, “impersonal sense,” or a way that doesn’t necessarily imply a specific person giving them cer tain things. People say, “I am grateful for this” or “I am grateful for that.” “Gr ateful” (grateful) means being thankful for something. We often don’t say to whom we are grateful.  

In any case, Gina is expressing her gratitude to a certain group of people. She’s actually thanking the people who have helped her “a long the way.” “Along the way” is an expression meaning over a period of time , or as you are trying to reach a certain goal or a certain point in your lif e. Mark interrupts Gina, who it seems is practicing a speech – a talk that she’s go ing to be giving to a group of people. He says, “You’re not going to start your sp eech with that boring opening, are you?”  

Mark thinks that Gina’s “opening,” the beginning of  her speech, is “boring” – not interesting. Gina disagrees. She says, “It’s not bo ring. It’s a nice,” or good, “opening.” Mark says, “It’s too formal and stiff.” “Stiff” (stiff) here means not relaxed, not normal, something that you say that is  perhaps not appropriate for the situation, perhaps even not sincere – that is, you don’t really mean it.  

Mark suggests a more informal beginning to the spee ch. He says, “How about,” meaning why don’t you try this, “Hey, everybody. Th anks a million!” The expression, “Thanks a million” (million) is an info rmal phrase meaning thank you very much, or perhaps thank you a million times, me aning I really thank you. Gina says, “That’s too informal.” Mark says, “Fine,  if you say so.” Notice that expression “if you say so” is often used when you d on’t want to argue with the other person, but you don’t agree with him either.   

 Mark says, “What comes next?” meaning what’s the ne xt part or the next sentence in the speech. He’s asking Gina to continu e her speech. Gina says, “Well, then I say, ‘I want to wholeheartedly thank those who stuck with us and never let us down.’” “Wholeheartedly” (wholehearted ly) means completely or entirely. It is often said when we are talking abou t things that we feel very deeply or that we have a strong emotion attached to. “I wa nt to wholeheartedly thank you” means I want to thank you really and sincerely , and with a lot of emotion.  

Gina wants to wholeheartedly thank those people who  “stuck with them.” “To stick (stick) with” someone is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to support someone or to stay with someone, to be loyal to som eone even when times are difficult, even when the situation is difficult. “S tuck” is the past tense of the verb “stick.” That’s why Gina says, “Those who stuck wit h us,” meaning who were there with us in the past when bad things happened to us, when the situation was difficult. “And” – she also wants to thank – “those  who never let us down.”  

The phrasal verb “to let someone down” or “to let d own” someone here means to disappoint someone – not to do what someone was exp ecting you to do. Mark doesn’t like this line in Gina’s speech, this sente nce. He says, “That’s too impersonal.” “Impersonal” (impersonal) means distan t, without feelings of warmth or closeness, or simply not being emotional enough.  Mark says, “How about” – once again, why don’t you try – “‘Hey Emiliano, you ’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab.’”  

Mark suggests speaking much more informally, includ ing using something such as “Hey.” “Hey” is a way of getting someone’s atten tion, but it’s very informal. “Hey Emiliano, you’re totally,” or your completely,  “awesome” (awesome). “Awesome” nowadays is an informal way of saying fan tastic, great, wonderful, or perhaps cool. Mark suggests also that Gina say, “An d you, Tanya? You’re absolutely fab (fab).” “Fab” is short for “fabulous ” (fabulous), which in this context means the same as awesome, fantastic, great, wonder ful.  

Gina says, “That doesn’t even come close to express ing how I would feel.” She thinks that Mark suggestions don’t express her emot ions properly. She says, “I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, gene rosity, and support from the bottom of my heart.” “Thoughtfulness” refers to som eone always thinking about another person, always considering that person, mak ing sure that person is happy.  

“Generosity” comes from the word “generous” (genero us). “To be generous” means to give money or time to other people so that  those people who need it  

have the help they need. If I’m “generous,” I’m giv ing you a lot of something – more than I have to, perhaps. Gina wants to thank p eople for being thoughtful, generous, and supporting her.  

She wants to do all of this from the bottom of her heart (heart). Doing something “from the heart” means doing it from a very deep em otion, or doing it sincerely. “From the bottom of your heart” means that you real ly mean it. You are expressing some very deep emotion, something that y ou want the person to understand as very sincere. You really mean it.  

Mark disagrees. He says that what Gina is saying is  “sappy” (sappy). “Sappy” means with too much emotion, so much emotion that i t seems exaggerated and perhaps insincere, not meaningful. He says, “Why do n’t you just give props to people who deserve it?” “To give props” (props) to someone is to recognize someone who has helped you, to recognize someone wh o has done something good, perhaps.  

It’s an informal expression, “to give props to.” Yo u’ll sometimes hear that when a rock star or perhaps a young actor is accepting an award. This happens very frequently here in Los Angeles, here in Hollywood, where people love to give each other awards for things. Someone will go up in  front of the audience the people watching the award show and say, “I want to give props to” a certain person. They’re thanking that person for something that person perhaps has done. They’re “giving credit to” that person becaus e they respect that person.  

Mark also says that Gina should just “give a shout- out to the people who have helped.” That’s another informal expression you wil l sometimes hear younger people use. A “shout- out” means I’m saying “hello”  to. A “shout (shout) – out (out)” is an informal expression, to be sure. “To g ive a shout out” is the expression, actually.  

Mark says that then Gina should jump off the stage and walk through the audience “to high-five everybody.” “To high (high) – five (five)” someone is to put your hand up as they put their hand up, their arm i n the air, and you hit each other’s hand. You hit their hand, or his hand or he r hand, as a way of showing excitement or as a way, in this case, of thanking t he people. Mark is suggesting a very unusual, informal way of thanking people.  

Gina says, “I’ll remember that,” meaning I will thi nk of your advice, “the next time I speak to a group of 10-year-olds!” Gina is sort o f making a joke here. She’s saying that what Mark is suggesting is more appropr iate for giving a speech to a  

group of children rather than to adults because of the informal ways that Mark is suggesting Gina deliver her speech.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Gina: I would like to begin by expressing my gratit ude to all the people who have helped me along the way . . . 

Mark: You’re not going to start your speech with th at boring opening, are you? 

Gina: It’s not boring. It’s a nice opening. 

Mark: It’s too formal and stiff. How about, “Hey, e verybody. Thanks a million!” 

Gina: That’s too informal.  

Mark: Fine, if you say so. What comes next? 

Gina: Well, then I say, “I want to wholeheartedly t hank those who stuck with us and who never let us down.” 

Mark: That’s too impersonal. How about, “Hey Emilia no, you’re totally awesome. And you, Tania? You’re absolutely fab. 

Gina: That doesn’t even come close to expressing ho w I feel. I want to thank people for their thoughtfulness, generosity, and su pport from the bottom of my heart. 

Mark: That’s so sappy! Why don’t you just give prop s to people who deserve it and a shout-out to the people who helped you? Then,  you jump off the stage and walk through the audience to high-five everybody. T hat’s how I would give a thank-you speech. 

Gina: I’ll remember that the next time I speak to a  group of 10-year-olds!
