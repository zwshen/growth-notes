This episode is called “Working from a Home Office.”  It’ s a dialogue between Adrina and Victor, using vocabulary associated with having an office at home. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adrina:  So this is your new home office.  It’s nice.

Victor:  It’s functional, and I like it.  When my compan y decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the option to work from home. When I heard that, I didn’t think twice about making t he change.

Adrina:  I’m not surprised.  Lots of people would kill to work from home.  Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?

Victor:  No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the office.

Adrina:  I assume you get to set your own schedule.  Do you  find it hard to concentrate on your work?  I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office.

Victor:  It’s true that there are a lot more distractio ns at home, but I try to block them out.  For me, it’s not getting down to work that ’s a problem, it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time!  That’s one of the drawbacks of working where you live.  I’m more productive, but I’m a lso more work-centered.

 Adrina:  I can see that, though I’d still take working from home over working at the office any day.

Victor:  I thought you had a home office for your real estate business.

Adrina:  I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting an y work done.

Victor:  Why’s that?

Adrina:  My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!

Our conversation begins with Adrina saying to Victor, “So this is your new home office.  It’s nice.”  Victor says, “It’s functional, and I like it.”  “To be functional” means to work properly; something that meets your needs, so mething that does what it’s supposed to do.  It’s usually used to describe so mething that works well but isn’t necessarily beautiful.  Victor says, “When my compa ny decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the opt ion to work from home.” “Overhead” (one word) is the amount of money a company h as to spend no matter how many products or services it sells.  It’s money tha t you have to spend, even if you only sell a little bit.  That would b e things like the rent for an office, the price of all of the equipment and materia ls in an office; these are part of a company’s overhead.  “Overhead” has a couple of diffe rent meanings however.  To find out more about those you have to go t o the Learning Guide.

So Victor says that his company decided to lower its overhead .  It wanted to reduce, or cut, its costs so it decided to decentralize.  “T o decentralize” means to spread things out so they’re not all concentrated, or cent ered, in one place.  We often add the suffix “ize” after a word to make it into  a verb: centralize; decentralize.  “To centralize,” of course, is the opposite,  to bring everything into one place.  Well, the company is decentralizing; it’s tell ing the employees they can work at home.  Victor says, “When I heard that, I did n’t think twice about making the change.”  “To think twice” means to hesitate i n making a decision; you’re thinking about it a lot.  But Victor didn’t thi nk about it at all; he knew this was a good choice for him – he didn’t think twice: “Whe n I saw the woman who later became my wife, as soon as I saw her I didn’t thi nk twice.  I said, ‘You will be my love.’”  Well, I didn’t say that to her of course,  she would have never come close to me if I had!

Adrina says, “I’m not surprised.  Lots of people would ki ll to work from home.” When we say someone “would kill to do (something)” we m ean the person really

 wants to do that thing or have that thing: “I would ki ll to have tickets to the World Series next year.”  I would do a lot, because I really wa nt it.  So if you have tickets to the World Series next year, please send me an email.  Of course, I won’t actually kill anyone to get my tickets!

Adrina says that a lot of people would kill to work from  home.  “Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?” she asks.  “Dedicated,”  here, means used for only one thing, for one purpose.  To have a dedicat ed phone line means that it’s a phone you have just for your business uses, you don’t share your personal phone for that reason.  Adrina is asking if Victor had to get dedicated phone and fax lines – telephone lines.  Victor says, “No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the o ffice.”  So he uses his cell phone as his company phone.

Adrina says, “I assume you get to set your own schedule.”  “T o set your own schedule” means to decide when you are going to do certai n things; you are in control of your schedule.  You can decide you’re going t o start work at 9:00 this morning, or at 10:00, or at 6:00 – you set your own sch edule.  Adrina says, “Do you find it hard to concentrate on your work?”  “To concen trate on (something)” means to focus on something, to put your attention on a particular thing.  Adrina says, “I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a h ome office.”  “To be distracted” means not to be able to pay attention to som ething, because you’re looking at something else or you’re listening to somethin g else.  If you’re talking to someone else and they’re distracted, they might be loo king out the window, they might be looking at their cell phone; they’re not really listening to you.

Adrina says, “I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office,” a place where you can work in your home.  Victor says, “It’s true  that there are a lot more distractions at home, but I try to block them out.”  “To block (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to ignore something, not to pay at tention to something, especially noise – things you can hear.  When I go to Star bucks and there is somebody talking next to me and I’m trying to read, I bl ock them out by listening to music.  So, Victor tries to block out the distractions.  “For me, it’s not getting down to work that’s a problem (meaning it’s not getti ng started and actually working), it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time!”  This is a problem with working at home, you always feel like you’re  at work.  “That’s one of the drawbacks,” he says, “of working where you live.”  A “d rawback” (one word) is a disadvantage, a negative aspect of doing something.  One drawback of living in Los Angeles is that there’s always traffic on the freew ays.  Another drawback is the pollution.  Another drawback could be the people  here; other than that, it’s a great place to live!

 Victor says, “I’m more productive, but I’m also more work-ce ntered.”  “To be productive” means to be able to get a lot of work done in a short period of time, to produce a lot of good results.  Victor says, “I’m more pro ductive, but I’m also more work-centered.”  “Work-centered” means focused on your  work.  We can use this construction – this form with many different kinds  of nouns.  You could say that she’s very “family-centered,” she’s focused on her fa mily.  That’s what’s most important to her, that’s where she spends most of h er time.  You could be “language learning-centered,” you always spend your time trying to improve your language skills, and so forth.

Adrina says, “I can see that (I can understand that), thou gh I’d still take working from home over working at the office any day.”  When we  say we “can take (something) over (something else)” we mean we would p refer that first thing over that second thing.  So for example: “Francesca is a veget arian, so she’ll always take a vegetable dish over a steak.”  She’ll prefer vegeta bles instead of the steak.

Victor says, “I thought you had a home office for your rea l estate business.” “Real estate” is selling homes or buildings.  Adrina says, “I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting any work done.”  Something that is “ conducive to (something)” is helpful, useful, something that helps you  do something else.  A lot of noise is not conducive to studying or to reading, at l east for me.  So, Victor asks Adrina why her home office is not very conducive to get ting any work done. She says, “My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!” When we say something “doubles as” something else, we mea n that it is used for more than one thing.  The word “double” actually has se veral meanings in English.  You know where you can find those, in the Lea rning Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
