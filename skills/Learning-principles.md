* 12/07 從evernote上把資料搬到github上，原來之前整理過life principels全文就405句。


## 2018

* 10/09 每個句子都會有個主要的句型、結構、或單詞，有助於聯想出整個句子，如reconcile, stretching for, exhilarating 等...有點像是chunk的線頭。
* 10/11 背熟句子後，腦子就有餘力去思考連音怎麼發，聽audio時也比較能注意到連音。
* 10/15 再默背時，前六句基本上很熟，沒什麼思考就能寫下來，但是後面的8-12句就得靠非常用力的回想，很容易漏掉一些介系詞。13-14句得要再花時間背背看。
* 10/16 背誦時，不知道是不是自已牙齒問題 (牽拖？) 總覺得發音很怪，是說，我沒有逼自已像Ray Dalio那樣發出相同的發音，我這個背誦做得不到位。但是一天一些進步是可以的，我不應該給自已太大壓力和焦慮。
* 10/19 估算背完1.1 ~ 1.10共405，必須要能每天背7句，一週能背50句，才能在12/14背完。
* 10/22 - 六、日都沒背誦的進度，今天一口氣從頭默背，想不到可以大都可以很熟的寫出來，約每句子1分鐘。但是到1.1 後就不行了，下的功夫不而已。整體進度還是落後。
* 10/24 每天大概只有花30分鐘在默寫舊句子和背新的句子，還沒有到1天背10句的程度。
* 10/25 1.1.a 未段的 work hard 一句的介系詞很難背...
