This episode is a dialogue between Florence and Ale xander about getting new drugs, especially new drugs that need to be approve d by the government. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Florence: A package came for you. I think it’s from  overseas.

Alexander: Oh, those are my drugs.

Florence: You’re buying your medication from overse as?

Alexander: I have no choice. This drug isn’t FDA-ap proved yet.

Florence: Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug that is n’t approved?

Alexander: Not if it’s been approved in other count ries. This drug is considered experimental here, but has been used in other count ries safely for years.

Florence: But shouldn’t you just wait? How long cou ld the process take anyway?

Alexander: You have no idea. It can take years for a drug to be approved here, especially those that aren’t fast-tracked.

Florence: That’s hard to believe.

Alexander: It’s true. First, it has to be tested on  animals or in a lab, and then it has to go through clinical trials. Only then is it put through a rigorous review by the FDA, which alone can take years.

Florence: You’re right. I had no idea.

Alexander: In the meantime, I’m suffering needlessl y.

Florence: You can’t legally import the drug for you r own use, right?

Alexander: That’s right, but I feel like I have to circumvent the law to get the medicine I need.

Florence: So how does it feel to be an outlaw?

Alexander: Um, healthy?

[end of dialogue]

Florence begins our dialogue by saying to Alexander , “A package came for you.” A “package” would be like a small box or perhaps an  envelope. When something “comes for you,” it arrives for you, usually in the  mail. Florence says, “I think it’s from overseas.” In the United States we use the ter m “overseas” (overseas) to refer to other countries.

Now technically, in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are  not overseas because you don’t have to go over an ocean – “sea” is another w ord for “ocean” – in in order to get there, but it’s a general term we use to mea n from a foreign country, from another country – specifically, from Europe or Asia  or Africa – if you’re in the United States, that is.

Alexander says, “Oh, those are my drugs.” “Drugs” a re medication, medicine that you take because you are sick, or for some other re ason. Some people take drugs even when they’re not sick. You’ll sometimes hear the word “drugs” used to mean illegal drugs (drugs like cocaine, heroin, and marijuana) but it can also be used to refer to what we call “prescription drug s” – drugs that you get from your doctor because you are sick – or simply drugs such as aspirin or other kinds of drug you can buy without the approval of a docto r.

Florence says to Alexander, “You’re buying your med ication from overseas?” “Medication” is just another word for drugs – thing s that you take to make you feel better or to get healthy. Alexander says, “I h ave no choice” – I have no option. “This drug isn’t FDA-approved yet.” “To be approved” means that someone or some organization says it’s okay to use or to buy. The “FDA” is the official government organization in the United Stat es that approves of drugs. FDA stands for “Food and Drug Administration.”

 Florence says, “Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug t hat isn’t approved?” Alexander responds, “Not if it’s been approved in other count ries.” Florence is asking if he, Alexander, thinks it is dangerous to take a drug th at has not been officially approved for use in the United States. Alexander sa ys no, it’s okay if it has been approved by other countries’ governments.

“The drug,” he continues, “is considered experiment al here, but has been used in other countries safely for years.” When we say a dr ug is “experimental,” we mean that we are still researching it, we are still exam ining it. We’re not sure if it’s safe yet. It’s not ready for everyone to use. “Experimen tal drugs” usually are drugs that have not yet been approved for the average per son to use. They can only be used in experiments that are carried out – conducte d – by researchers and scientists.

Florence says, “But shouldn’t you just wait? How lo ng could the process take anyway?” Florence thinks that Alexander should wait  until the FDA approves of the drug for use here in the United States. Alexand er has different ideas. He tells Florence that, in fact, in the United States, it ca n take many years – a very long time – for a drug to be approved.

He says, “You have no idea,” meaning you don’t real ly understand the situation here. “It can take years for a drug to be approved here, especially those that aren’t fast-tracked.” The expression “fast-tracked”  (tracked) refers to something that is done more quickly than usual – something th at would normally take a long time, especially in the approval of some plan or id ea, that is instead approved very quickly. Governments sometimes, if there is a serious illness or disease that is affecting people, “fast-track” – approve somethi ng more quickly than they would normally otherwise do.

Florence says, “That’s hard to believe.” Alexander says, “It’s true. First, it has to be tested on animals or in a lab.” When we test dru gs on animals, we give the drug to an animal and see if the animal dies. For s omething to be “tested in a lab” means that scientists and researchers look at the d rug in a laboratory. The word “lab” (lab) is short for “laboratory,” which is a p lace where scientists conduct their experiments.

Alexander says, “Then it,” meaning the drug, “has t o go through clinical trials.” “Clinical (clinical) trials (trials)” are research studies that doctors do on a small group of humans, of people who are sick, to make su re that the drug is safe. Clinical trials are required for most drugs that are approved by the FDA in the United States. You have to test the drug on a group  of people to make sure that

it’s safe for the average person. Many times, you can get paid to participate in these clinical trials. The government or drug compa nies will give you money to participate in the experiment.

Alexander says, “Only then is it” – again, the drug  – “put through a rigorous review by the FDA, which alone can take years.” A “ rigorous (rigorous) review (review)” is a very thorough, detailed investigatio n of something – when you look at something very closely to make sure that everyth ing is okay. Alexander says that the FDA’s review alone can take years.

The word “alone” here means by itself – not includi ng all of the other steps, all of the other things that have to happen in order for t he drug to get approved. If you say a person is “alone,” you mean that the person i s by him or herself. There are no other people with that person. Here, it refers t o the fact that just this one thing, just this one part of the process, can take many ye ars, not including the time it would take for all the other things to occur.

Florence says, “You’re right, I had no idea,” meani ng “I wasn’t aware of this. I didn’t know this before you told me. Oh, Alexander,  you’re so smart. I love you.” Oh, no – she doesn’t say that. Maybe Alexander is t rying to impress Florence; maybe Alexander is interested romantically in Flore nce and he’s just telling her all of these things so that Florence will fall in l ove with his intelligence. You think? Nah. Anyway, back to our story.

Alexander says, “In the meantime” – meaning while I  am waiting for the FDA to approve of this drug – “I’m suffering needlessly.” If something is done “needlessly” (needlessly), it is being done without  a good reason, without a good cause. Alexander is saying that by waiting, he woul d be suffering. He would be in pain, say, more, without any reason to, because he could get this drug from another country.

Florence, however, reminds Alexander – or asks him,  in any case – “You can’t legally import the drug for your own use, right?” “ To import” (import) means to bring something into a country from another country . In the United States, normally it’s not legal for you to buy drugs in ano ther country and bring them into the United States if those drugs are not legal alre ady in the U.S.

Alexander says, “That’s right” – that’s correct; I can’t do that. “But,” he says, “I feel like I have to circumvent the law to get the m edicine I need.” “To circumvent” (circumvent) means to go around something. Usually it’s used to mean to find a way to avoid rules and restrictions that you don’t want to follow – to do something that isn’t necessarily allowed by the rules, but al lows you to do what you want to

do. In the case of Alexander, he’s circumventing the law. He’s really breaking the law, going against the law, by bringing these drugs  in, but it is something that he thinks is helping him.

Florence says, “So how does it feel to be an outlaw ?” The word “outlaw” (outlaw) is an older term for a person who breaks the law, s omeone who has done something illegal, but has not yet been arrested or  caught by the police. Florence is asking Alexander how it feels “to be an outlaw” – to be a criminal, in effect. Alexander says, “Um, healthy?” meaning he feels hea lthy. He feels better, and he feels better because, in fact, he was able to br ing these drugs illegally into the United States in order to make him feel better, in order to help cure him of whatever disease he has.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
