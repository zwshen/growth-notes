		<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish that you remember king Basm and 
		Koorosh from the contest of last year! But do not worry; I will 
		introduce them to you, again! In ancient times, many territories were 
		under the control of a powerful king called Basm. Basm is well-known in 
		history because of his strange works and as a result, there are many 
		history-lovers who wish to know more about him. Koorosh Esteghrarzadeh 
		is one of them and he has worked hard to find a way to know more about 
		Basm’s works. Recently, he managed to invent a Time Machine™ and 
		traveled to the past to Basm time in order to be able to see and study 
		his weird works thoroughly. Unfortunately, he has been caught by royal 
		guard soldiers of Basm and is now in his prison. </p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, Basm’s advisors 
		suggested him to build a new city, named Avrenim, to improve the 
		industry of his territories and they gave him the road map of the city. 
		The advisors have designed the city such that all roads are 
		<i>unidirectional</i> and there exists at least one path from each junction to 
		any other junction in the city and there is not any road from a junction 
		to itself. In addition, they estimated the time that construction of 
		each road requires. Also, they told Basm the whole structure of the map 
		is confidential and must stay unknown until the city completely 
		constructed, because otherwise, it will not affect the industry that 
		much. </p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">As Basm madly loves his wife, he likes 
		to be with her all the times! Thus, he likes to work as less as possible and he 
		decided to construct just some of the roads instead of all of them. 
		Then, after constructing these roads, he wants to order his little 
		brother to construct the remaining roads by just telling him the roads 
		endpoints, but not their directions (to secure the whole structure of the map 
		to some extent) and ordering him to choose the direction of the roads 
		such that there exists at least one path from each junction to any other 
		junction in the city. Now, he wants to select the roads (if required all 
		of them!), which he should construct, with minimum sum of construction 
		time such that after ending of construction, the resulted road map be 
		exactly the same as the road map his advisors suggested him (in other 
		words, his selection of the roads forces appropriate direction of the other roads to 
		satisfy the constraint mentioned above). Now, Basm ordered Koorosh to 
		solve this problem given the roads of the city and their construction 
		time, if he wants to stay alive!</p>
	  <p><font style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Input</b></font><br>
		The input begins with a&nbsp;positive integer&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> showing the 
		number of test cases and then,<strong> T</strong> test cases follow. 
		Each test case begins with a line containing two integers <strong>0&lt;n </strong>&lt;= 50 
		and <strong>m </strong>&lt;= 1000) showing the number of junctions and 
		roads respectively. Then, <strong>m </strong>lines come containing two 
		integer <strong>h</strong> and <strong>t</strong> between <b>1</b> and
		<b>n</b> showing head and tail of a road and a positive real number <strong>c
		</strong>showing the construction time of this road. There is a blank 
		line after each test case. </p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;"><font style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Output</b></font><br>
		For&nbsp;each test case, your program must output the minimum sum of 
		construction times of the roads, which Basm&nbsp;must construct.The output should be precise to 4 decimal digits after floating point
