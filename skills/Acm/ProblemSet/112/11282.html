<h1>MIXING INVITATIONS</h1>

<img align=right src=p11282.png>
<p>Kelly is having a birthday party soon, and would like to invite all
her friends to come. There is one problem though: her house
is far too small to accommodate everyone! She has already
written up personalised invitations to all her friends with corresponding addressed envelopes to mail them in, and now
she doesn't know what to do.</p>

<p>Luckily, Alex has thought of a clever way to help Kelly
out. He knows that if a friend receives an invitation
personalised to him or her, that friend will
definitely come to the party. However, if a
friend receives an invitation personalised to
someone else (ie. the wrong invitation),
that friend will surely not come to the party.
Alex then goes to mix up Kelly's invitations and envelopes so that some invitations
may be mailed to the wrong addressee. This way everyone still gets an invitation and nobody is left out, 
but no more people would come than would fit into Kelly's house.</p>

<p>There are exactly as many envelopes as there are invitations, and each invitation has a corresponding
 envelope with the same addressee. Alex must place each invitation into an envelope 
 in such a way that there are no more invitations in their correct envelopes than the
amount of people Kelly can accommodate.</p>

<p>Being the clever mathematician that he is, Alex would like to count the number of ways that
he can mix up the invitations and envelopes to accomplish his goal. Can you write a program 
to do this for Alex?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file contains several test cases, each on a separate line. Each line contains two
positive integers, N and M, separated by a space. N (1 &le; N &le; 20) is the number of invitations
Kelly has written, and M (0 &le; M &le; N) is the maximum number of people Kelly can accommodate.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output on a separate line a single integer: the number of ways Alex can
mix up the invitations and envelopes to accomplish his goal.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>

3 2
4 1
4 4

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
