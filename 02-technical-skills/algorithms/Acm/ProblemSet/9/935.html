Steve and Digit bought a box containing a number of cookies. In order
to divide the cookies among themselves they decided to play a special
game they invented. The players alternately take a certain,
positive number of cookies from the box, but no more than a fixed
integer. Each player's cookies are gathered on the player's side. The
player that empties the box eats his cookies while the other one puts
his cookies back into the box and the game continues with the
``looser'' player starting first.  The game goes on until all the
cookies are eaten. The goal of the game is to eat the most cookies. How
many cookies can Steve, who starts the game, count on, assuming the
best strategy for both players?

<P align="justify"> 
Your task consists of writing a program that:

<ul>
<li> reads the parameters of the game from the standard input,
<li> computes the number of cookies that Steve can count on,
<li> writes the result to the standard output.
</ul>

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 

The first and only line of input contains exactly two integers <i>n</i> and
<i>m</i> separated by a single space, <i>1 <= m <= n <= 100</i> --
parameters of the game, where <i>n</i> is the number of cookies in the box
at the beginning of the game and <i>m</i> is the upper limit on the number
of cookies to be taken by one player in one move.


<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 

The output contains exactly one integer equal to the number of cookies that
Steve can count on.
