This episode is called “Dealing With an Angry Client.”  It’s a phone conversation between Shawna and Monty, and, well, let’s just say they have some problems. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shawna:  Hello, Shawna Davis.

Monty:  Hello, Shawna.  This is Monty Lofti at BMC.  I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newspaper yesterday.

Shawna:  Sure, Monty.  Was there a problem?

Monty:  Yes, there certainly was a problem.  Instead of  the picture of our model, there was a picture of a dog!

Shawna:  That’s awful!  I wasn’t aware of the substitut ion.  On behalf of the newspaper, I sincerely apologize for the error.

Monty:  I don’t think you understand the magnitude of the problem.  Our slogan is: “Look in the mirror and this could be you!”  Now do you get it?  Our store is a laughingstock!

 Shawna:  I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this egr egious mistake.  We will certainly run a correction in tomorrow’s paper, and we w ill run a corrected version of your ad.  That’s the least we can do.  Is there anythi ng else we can do to make amends for our mistake?

Monty:  Yes, there is.  I’d like the person responsible to be called on the mat for this.

Shawna:  Rest assured.  We take this matter very seriously.  We’ll find out who is responsible and heads will roll.

Monty:  Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear.

This conversation begins with Shawna saying, “Hello, Shawn a Davis.”  Monty says, “Hello, Shawna.  This is Monty Lofti at BMC (the na me of his company).  I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newsp aper yesterday.”  The “ad” is the advertisement – the announcement for their compan y.  We say something “ran” in the newspaper when we mean it was in the new spaper – it appeared in the newspaper.

So, Monty is calling Shawna, who works for the newspaper.   Monty is a “client” of Shawna’s, meaning that he is buying some sort of service or  product from Shawna.  Shawna says, “Sure, Monty.  Was there a problem ?”  Monty says, “Yes, there certainly was a problem.”  The use of the wo rd “certainly,” here, means definitely, clearly, without any doubt.  It’s used t o emphasize that yes, there was a problem.  Monty says, “Instead of the picture  of our model (a man or a woman who is in the advertisement), there was a pictu re of a dog!”

Shawna says, “That’s awful!” – that’s horrible, that’s te rrible.  “That’s awful!  I wasn’t aware of the substitution.”  A “substitution” i s when you replace one thing for another, when you use one thing in and other thin g’s place.  Shawna says, “On behalf of the newspaper, I sincerely apologize for t he error.”  The expression “on behalf of” means that you are representing that p erson or organization; you are doing it for them.  On behalf of everyone at ESL Podcast, I thank you for listening.  That means I’m representing – I’m speaking for everybody else on the podcast.  Shawna says, “On behalf of the newspaper, I since rely apologize.” “Sincerely” means honestly, openly, really.  It’s a formal term, here, that means that I honestly apologize; I am very sorry.

 Monty says, “I don’t think you understand the magnitude of  the problem.” “Magnitude,” here, just means the size or amount of some thing.  So, it’s a large problem is probably what Monty is saying here.  “Magnitud e” has a number of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word.  Monty says, “Our slogan (the  slogan of the company) is: ‘Look in the mirror and this could be you!’”  A “slog an” is a short phrase that often appear in advertisements, usually trying to make peo ple to buy something or perhaps to vote for someone in an election.  Politica l candidates have slogans. Coca-Cola company had a slogan: “It’s the real thing.”  That was their advertising slogan to get people to buy Coca-Cola.

Well, the slogan for Monty’s company is: “Look in the mirr or and this could be you!” meaning what you see in the mirror could be you.  Monty says, “Now do you get it (now do you fully understand what I am talki ng about)?  Our store is a laughingstock!”  Monty is saying that his store (his company) is now a laughingstock.  The word “laughingstock” means someone has d one something very silly or stupid, so everyone is laughing at him.  You don’t want to be the laughingstock – the person that everyone laughs at – and that’s what Monty says has happened here.

Shawna says, “I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this e gregious mistake.”  “I can’t tell you” is an expression that we use to show that yo u know this is a very big or important problem, and you are not able to exp ress completely what you want to say because it is so big, because it is so serious.  S o, she’s trying to make Monty happier, trying to calm him down perhaps, by saying “I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this egregious mistake.”  “Egregious ” (egregious) means a very bad, obvious mistake or problem, something that you can not possibly hide.

Shawna says, “We will certainly run a correction in tomorr ow’s paper,” meaning they will publish (they will print) in the newspaper to morrow a correction to the ad.  “That’s the least we can do,” she says.  The expressio n “it’s the least I can do” is a phrase used to show that you are very willing to do something, even though it is small or unimportant.  So, you go to a h otel, and the hotel does not have your reservation even though you called that day to make one, and the hotel manager says, “I’m very sorry.  The least I can do is give you a free dinner.” It doesn’t make up for the entire problem, but it’s a small or smaller thing that you are saying that you will do.  Shawna says, “Is there anythi ng else we can do to make amends for our mistake?”  The expression “to make ame nds” (amends)

 means to do something to show that you are sorry for wha t mistake you have committed

Monty says, “Yes, there is.  I’d like the person responsible to be called on the mat for this.”  “To be called on the mat” (mat) means to b e held responsible for something, to be punished for having done something wro ng.  Shawna says, “Rest assured,” which is a formal expression that means do n’t worry.  “We take this matter very seriously.  We’ll find out who is responsi ble and heads will roll.” This expression, “heads will roll,” means that people who  have done something wrong will lose their jobs – will be punished.  Usuall y it means they will be fired, so if your boss says, “I’m going to find out who made this mistake and heads will roll,” and you made the mistake, well, you might want t o start looking for another job!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
