This episode is a dialog between Tony and Amber abo ut working in a factory – a place where things are made or manufactured. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Tony:  The plant manager says that you’re the new k id.

Amber:  Yes, it’s my first day.

Tony:  All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us. Here’s your workstation. What you have to remember is that output and produc tivity are the most important things around here.

Amber:  I understand, but...

Tony:  Watch out for that forklift! You have to wat ch where you’re going or you’ll ruin our safety record.

Amber:  Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery? I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything .

Tony:  I’m going to teach you, so pay attention. the other thing you have to worry about around here is quality control. If you don’t do things right, you’ll hear about it.

Amber:  Okay, but...

Tony:  Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re n ot careful, you’ll get your head taken off in this factory. Now, try to pay attentio n.

 Amber:  I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my lif e is in danger every other minute.

Tony:  [sighs] Rookies!

[end of dialog]

Tony begins our dialog by saying to Amber, “The pla nt manager says that you’re the new kid.” A “plant (plant) manager (manager)” i s the most important supervisor in a factory, the most important boss. “ Plant” here refers to a place where things are made. A factory, which is in the t itle of our episode, is also a place where things are made. The two words mean the  same, “factory” or “plant.” When I say, “things are made,” I mean, typically, p hysical things – chairs or cars or doors. We’re not talking about computer software , for example, but the actual computers, the physical machines would be made in a  plant or in a factory. Tony refers to the “plant manager,” calling Amber the “n ew kid,” meaning the new employee, in this case. It doesn’t mean that she’s actually a child.

Amber says, “Yes, it’s my first day.” Tony says, “A ll right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us.” A “line (line) worker” is a p erson who has a “low level job,” we would call it, not a very important or complicated job – usually, working on what’s called an “assembly line.” An “assembly line” is wh en you are making some product, some thing, and everyone does something in  order. Often, you’re all standing next to each other. So, I may put in the f irst screw and I give it to you, and you put in a bolt, and then you give it to anot her person and they put a cover on, and then they give it to someone else, and you’ re doing the same thing over and over again all day. That’s being a line worker.

Tony says to Amber, “Here’s your workstation.” Your  “workstation” is the place, of course, where you work. It’s usually a small area, maybe a desk, but not a complete office, not an entire office of your own. In a factory, your workstation might just be a very small table, for example.

“What you have to remember,” Tony says, “is that ou tput and productivity are the most important things around here.” “Output” (outpu t) is what a person or a machine produces – what they make. A big factory ma y make thousands of telephones, cellular telephones, mobile phones, eve ryday or even every hour. That would be their output. “Productivity” refers t o how much work you get done in a certain amount of time. When productivity incr eases, workers are able to produce more with the same amount of time. So, inst ead of producing a thousand cell phones a day, the same amount of work ers with the same amount

of time, produce ten thousand new cell phones. This  is an increase in productivity, either because the workers are workin g harder or because the technology allows to be more productive, to have a higher output. Notice I use “high” or “low” for output. For productivity, we ta lk about it “rising” or “falling.”

Amber says, “I understand but…” Tony interrupts her  and says, “Watch out for that forklift!” “Watch out” means “be careful.” A “ forklift” (forklift) is a machine with a large, strong piece of metal in the front of it. Typically there’re like two bars, and they go underneath heavy objects and are able to li ft them up and take them from one place to another. So, if you have a heavy box, you might have a forklift come, and it puts these two bars – flat bars – unde rneath it, and it looks kind of like a fork. So, that’s why it’s called a “forklift .” Then it is able to lift it up and move it to another location.

Tony says, “You have to watch where you’re going or  you’ll ruin our safety record.” “Safety” is the opposite of having acciden ts. “Safety” refers to people not getting hurt, not getting injured, not getting kill ed. The “safety record of the factory,” or the plant, refers to how many people a re injured in the factory every year, and many times, there are injuries. There are  people who get hurt in factories or in plants.

Amber says, “Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery?” “Machinery” (machinery) are large pieces of equipment typically  operated by electricity or some other power source. “Machinery” usually refers  to a piece of equipment that makes something else, although not always.

Amber says, “I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything.” An “assembly (assembly) line” is, as we referred to earlier, the process where you have many people working to build or crea te something, and each person does the same thing over and over again. I d o one thing, then you do something, then the next person does something else . An “assembly line” can also have machines instead of people, and many of t hem do nowadays. “Assembly” comes from the verb “to assemble” (assem ble) which means to put something together.

Amber says that she’s never worked on an assembly l ine before, “to mass- produce anything.” “To produce” means to make. “To mass- (mass) produce” means to make a large amount of things, especially things that are identical. They’re not made for an individual person. You make  the same thing over and over again. Tony says, “I’m going to teach you, so pay attention,” meaning focus on what I’m saying.

“The other thing you have to worry about around her e is quality control.” “Quality” is how good or bad something is. “Control” is makin g sure something is the way it’s supposed to be. So, “quality control” is testi ng the products, testing the things that are made to make sure that they were made corr ectly.

“If you don’t do things right,” Tony says, “you’ll hear about it.” This expression “you’ll hear about it,” means, usually, that you’ve  done something wrong and that you are being told about it and probably will be pu nished for it. So, a child might be told by his parent, “If you cause any problems o n the playground today, you’ll hear about it,” meaning I’m going to talk to you ab out it and it’s not going to be good news.

Amber says, “Okay but…” Tony again interrupts her a nd says, “Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re not careful, you’ll get yo ur head taken off in this factory.” “To be taken off” means to be removed or separated.  Tony is telling Amber to be careful. She apparently started to stand up and per haps another machine was moving past her. The factory, of course, is the pla nt, the building where things are made. Tony says, “Now, try to pay attention.” A mber says, “I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my life is in danger every other mi nute.” “Every other minute” means often, very often, very frequently.

Tony is not very happy with Amber. He sighs. He goe s “(sighs) Rookies!” A “rookie” (rookie) is someone who is new to a job or  new to an organization, someone who doesn’t have very much experience. We u sually use this term in talking about sports, somebody who is new to the pr ofessional teams or the professional leagues. A baseball player from colleg e, who then starts playing for one of the professional baseball teams like the Los  Angeles Dodgers, that person would be called a “rookie” during their first year.  They’re new. The term more generally means anyone who’s new to doing something ; usually, someone with less experience.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
