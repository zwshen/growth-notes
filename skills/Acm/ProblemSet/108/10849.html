<p class="MsoBodyText">Consider you have a chess board with <i>NxN</i>
squares, 1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100.000.000. There is only a
piece on the board: the bishop. The position of the bishop is
given by a pair of numbers 1 &le; <i>r,c </i>&le; <i>N</i>; <i>r</i>
is the row and <i>c</i> is the column. Position <i>(1,1)</i>
refers to the bottom-left square of the board, while position <i>(N,N)</i>
refers to the up-right square.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The problem consists of calculating the
minimum number of movements that the bishop have to do to reach a
given square of the board, given the position of the bishop and the
position of that square. If this movement is not possible, the
output must be: &#147;no move&#148;. Don´t worry if you don´t
know how to play chess. The only information you need is: the
bishop moves diagonally any number of squares, forwards or
backwards as long as its path is not blocked by other pieces.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Input</font></h2>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The
input begins with a single integer, <em>C</em>, indicating the
number of test cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank
line between two consecutive test cases.</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><a
name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">For each test case, the
first line contains an integer 1 &le; <i>T &le;</i> 100,
indicating the number of tests for that case. The second line
contains an integer 1 &le; <i>N &le; </i>100.000.000, for a
chess board with <i>NxN</i> squares. Then the test lines follow,
and for each one, there are four numbers separated by a single
space. The first two numbers are the row and column where the
bishop is, and the last two numbers are the row and column of the
position of the square that the bishop have to reach.</a></p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Output</font></h2>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><a name="SECTION0001005000000000000000">For
each test line you should produce an output line. This line just
contains a number that indicates the minimum number of movements
for the bishop according to positions described in the input
line, or the message &#147;no move&#148; if the position is not
reachable. </a></p>
