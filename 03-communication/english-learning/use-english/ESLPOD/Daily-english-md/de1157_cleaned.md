[start of dialogue] 

Venus: Kids, cover your eyes! Don’t look at that. I  didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you bring us here? 

Milo: I brought you here to see this celebration of  the beauty of the human form.  

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on  that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on d isplay for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked! 

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate t he artists’ creations? 

Venus: I’m not one of those people who go to nude b eaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibited. This is  shameful! 

Milo: This isn’t a nude beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.  

Venus: I don’t call this art. I call it pornography . I’m taking my kids out of here. Oh my God, there are full frontals wherever you look! Kids, keep your eyes covered. We’re leaving. 

Milo: All right, but I was just trying to open your  kids’ eyes to art.  

 Venus: You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!

Venus begins our dialogue by saying to her children , “Kids, cover your eyes.” The expression “to cover your eyes” means to put yo ur hands in front of your eyes so that you don’t see something bad. If you’re  watching a movie and there’s a very violent scene, a part with a lot of violence , and you know that your husband or wife doesn’t like that kind of violence,  you may say, “Cover your eyes,” meaning don’t look at the screen, or put you r hands in front of your eyes so that you don’t see this.  

Venus is telling her children to cover their eyes. “Don’t look at that,” she says. “I didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you  bring us here?” “Nudity” (nudity) comes from the word “nude” (nude). “To be nude” means not to have any clothing on. We might also say “to be naked” (naked ) – without clothing. Venus is asking Milo why he brought them to this place. We l ater learn it’s a museum that has nudity.  

Milo says, “I brought you here to see this celebrat ion of the beauty of the human form.” The “human form” means the shape and appeara nce of the human body. Venus, however, doesn’t think this is a good thing.  She says, “This is obscene.” “Obscene” (obscene) is something that is considered  very vulgar or inappropriate, usually something related to nudity or sexual activity. Something that is obscene is considered to be unacceptable by  the social standards of the community or of the culture.  

Certain things might be considered obscene in one c ulture or in one historical period that are not considered obscene in a differe nt one. Venus, however, thinks that the nudity she is seeing is obscene. She says,  “Look at the bare breasts on that one and the one over there is topless.” “Breas ts” (breasts) are two things that women have on their chest, in the top front of  their body, that are used to among other things feed children, young babies. “Ba re (bare) breasts” are breasts that are not covered with any kind of cloth ing.  

“Topless” (topless) refers usually to a woman, but it could be a man who doesn’t have a shirt on, who doesn’t have anything that is covering the top part of his or her body. If a woman is “topless,” then you will se e her “bare breasts.” A great deal of Western art, especially during the Renaissa nce period in Europe, features the human body that is naked. Similarly, you find a rt from the ancient world –  

ancient Greece and Rome – where the human body was shown without any clothing.  

Venus doesn’t like this. She then says, “That man’s  private parts are on display for everyone to see.” Venus is, we think, pointing at a statue. It’s not a real man. It’s a statue of a man, a representation of a man. She points out that the man’s “private parts are on display.” A person’s “private  parts” are those parts of the body that we normally cover with clothing.  

For both a man and a woman, that would include the parts around your waist – that is, where your legs meet the lower part of you r body. For a woman, “private parts” usually also include her breasts. These are things that are typically covered with clothing in most Western countries, an d certainly in most places in the United States. To have something “on display” ( display) is to have something so that everyone can see it. It’s in a place where everyone can see it. Venus is saying that this statue is showing a man’s private parts so that everyone can see them.  

“Most of these,” Venus continues, “are butt naked.”  Your “butt” (butt) is your rear, what you sit on. It’s a somewhat informal word, but  a perfectly good word to use in any circumstance. In more formal English, we mig ht refer to it as a person’s “behind” (behind), or if you want to be really soph isticated, you might use a word that comes from the French, your “derriere.” My fat her would sometimes use that word instead of “butt,” but most people say “but.” Notice there are two “t”s in this “butt.”  

“Butt naked” refers to someone who doesn’t have any  clothes on, and so you can see the persons butt. It’s usually a general term, however, to refer to someone who doesn’t have clothes on any part of his body. M ilo says, “Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate the artist’s creations?” “ To see past” (past) something means to ignore or not be bothered by some negative  part of an experience or something that you’re reading or looking at in orde r to appreciate or enjoy the better things, the good things, the good qualities of something.  

Venus says, “I’m not one of those people who go to nude beaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibite d. This is shameful!” Let’s start with the term “nude beaches.” A “beach” (beach) is an area next to an ocean or possibly a lake that people go and sit on in order to get a suntan. A “nude beach” is a beach where you can sit without wearing any cl othing. This is not very common in the U.S. There are, I guess, places like this. I myself have never been to one, but a nude beach would be a beach where it isn’t illegal to be naked.  

Normally, if you walk around a town or a city witho ut any clothes on, you might get arrested for not having any clothes on, but on a “nude beach” usually you are safe to do that. In other words, it’s not against t he law to be nude in public as it is in most places in the U.S. Venus says she’s “not on e of those people,” meaning she’s not the kind of person who goes to nude beach es and runs around in her birthday suit. “To run around” means simply to walk  around, I think, in this case, or to move around.  

Your “birthday suit” refers to you not wearing any clothing. When we say someone has their “birthday suit” (suit) on, we mea n the person doesn’t have any clothing on, just as the day that you were born was , when you came out of your mother’s body without any clothing on. You didn’t h ave any clothing on when you were born, and so we call that condition of not hav ing any clothes on your “birthday suit.” A “suit” normally is, of course, a  set of clothing that you have on – pants and a shirt, for example, perhaps even a tie if you’re a man.  

Venus says she doesn’t run around in her birthday s uit “uninhibited” (uninhibited). “To be inhibited” means to not want to reveal yours elf or to be shy, to be unwilling to do certain things, perhaps because you’re embarr assed by them or you don’t think they’re appropriate. The opposite of that is “to be uninhibited.” To be uninhibited means not to be embarrassed by anything , just to do whatever you want, not to think that it’s inappropriate – most i mportantly, not to care about what other people think of your actions.  

Venus thinks that these nude statues, this art that  she’s seeing is “shameful” (shameful). Something that is “shameful” is somethi ng that causes you feelings of embarrassment – when you think that it’s wrong, when you think that it’s inappropriate. Milo says, however, “This isn’t a nu de beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.”  

It occurs to me now that perhaps Venus is a teacher  rather than a parent, but in any case, Milo is telling her that she and the chil dren are in the museum in order to appreciate great art, some of the best art in hi story. Venus says, “I don’t call this art. I call it pornography.” “Pornography” (po rnography) refers to images that are intended to sexually excite the person who sees  them or watches them. A shorter form of the word “pornography” is “porn” (p orn). Venus thinks this art that shows the naked or nude human form is pornography.  

She says, “I’m taking my kids out of here.” “Oh my God,” she says, “there are full frontals wherever you look.” “Full (full) frontals (frontals)” refers to the fronts of people’s bodies which are naked, basically people w ho don’t have any clothes  

on. The term “frontal” comes from another expressio n, “frontal nudity,” which describes seeing the front of someone’s body withou t any clothing on.  

Milo says, “All right, but I was just trying to ope n your kids’ eyes to art.” “To open someone’s eyes to” something means to get him to un derstand or appreciate something he hasn’t seen or understood before. Venu s says, “You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!” “To slam” (slam) something means to close something, but with a lot of force. If you “slam the door,” you close it using a lot of force so that it makes a lo ud noise. Venus is saying that she’s closing her children’s eyes because she doesn ’t want them to see what she thinks is pornographic.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Venus: Kids, cover your eyes! Don’t look at that. I  didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you bring us here? 

Milo: I brought you here to see this celebration of  the beauty of the human form.  

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on  that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on d isplay for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked! 

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate t he artists’ creations?

Milo: All right, but I was just trying to open your  kids’ eyes to art. 

Venus: You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!
