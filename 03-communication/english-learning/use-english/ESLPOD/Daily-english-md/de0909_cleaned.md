This episode is a dialogue between Kindo and Nookie  about buying electronic books. Let's get started.  

[start of dialog] 

Kindo: What’s that? 

Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloa ding some new books onto it.  

Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.  

Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you  know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 di gital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library  from place to place. 

Kindo: I don’t usually read 10,000 books all at onc e and I hear that there are a lot of incompatible formats out there. Each company is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the  format. I think I’ll just wait until the dust sett les. 

Nookie: The different formats aren’t that big a dea l. You can easily convert a book in one format to another. 

Kindo: I like the look of text on a printed page.  

Nookie: You mean that faded text on that yellowed p age? On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line s pacing. 

Kindo: Can I get all of the out-of-print books on m y shelves in digital format? 

Nookie: Well, I’m not sure.  

Kindo: Until I can, I’ll stick to my low-tech books .

We begin the dialog with “Kindo” (his real name!) a sking “Nookie,” which perhaps is a nickname, “What's that?” Nookie says, “It's my  new e-book reader.” An e- book reader is a small electronic device, usually t hat you can hold in your hands, that has electronic books. Examples would be the Ki ndle, the Nook, the iPad, using the iBook software – all of these would be cu rrent examples of e-book readers, although the iPad is more than an e-book r eader. That's what Nookie has.  

Hey, maybe Nookie is related to “Nook” and “Kindo” is related to Kindle. Ahh…see, our Dr. Tse is very clever!  

Anyway, Nookie says, “I'm just downloading some new  books on to it.” “To download” means to transfer information from the In ternet to your computer, or your phone, or whatever it is that you have. Nookie  is downloading some books onto the new device. Kindo says, “I haven't bought one yet. I'm old school. I still prefer a printed book.” The expression “old school”  means old-fashioned, preferring things from a long time ago. This is als o a very common expression nowadays, when people are talking about the way the y may do things. They may do them the way they used to be done many years ago , or it could be used to describe, as I think was one of the original uses, music. “I like old-school music from the 70’s and the 80’s.”  

In our dialog, Kindo is “old school.” He says he pr efers a “printed book.” A “printed book” would be a book on physical paper. T he idea is that he likes doing things the way we used to do them. Nookie says, “Bu t if you haven't tried it yet, how do you know you won't like it better? This e-bo ok reader can store over 10,000 digital books.” “To store” (store) here, as a verb, means to keep something so that you can use it in the future. For  electronics, for computers, “to store” means to have something on your permanent me mory in your computer.  

“Digital” (digital) refers to electronic informatio n – things that are stored on the hard drive of a computer, for example, things that are stored typically in what is called “binary (binary) code” – with zeros and ones . Nookie says that her e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it's  “easily portable.” “To be portable” (portable) means that you can move it fro m one place to another. You can pick it up and move it to another place without  any difficulty. Nookie says, “Imagine” – or try to imagine, try to think about –  “trying to carry an entire library from place to place.” Nookie is saying that the e-b ook reader that she has is like  

having an entire library in your pocket, an entire library that you can carry from one place to another. 

Kindo says, “I don't usually read 10,000 books all at once,” meaning I don't read 10,000 books at the same time. So, Kindo is suggest ing here, perhaps, that's not such a big advantage. He also says that there are a  lot of “incompatible formats” out there. “To be incompatible” (incompatible) mean s that you are not able to get along with, or you are not able to use one thing wi th another. When we talk about physical things, “incompatible” means that you can' t use this thing with that thing. “Format” just refers to the way that a certain piec e of information, in this case, an electronic book, is created and stored. It's the fo rm that that particular piece of information takes. So, for example, if you have a K indle e-reader, you use something called .MOBI, or least that's one of the formats that can be used. Microsoft Word is another format. PDF is a format. These are ways of transmitting information.  

If you have “incompatible formats,” you have a file , an electronic piece of information, that can't be used with certain things . They're incompatible. They can't be used together. So, Kindo says that “Each c ompany is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the  format.” “To edge (edge) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to try to push someon e else out of a competition or to eliminate someone from a certain competition.  In this case, it's the competition for consumers. “One company edges out a nother” is another way of saying one company is more successful than the othe r. One company is able to be the number one company in that particular area. In this case, we're talking about e-book readers.  

Kindo says that “Each company is trying to edge out  the others” – the other companies – “by establishing” – or by creating and trying to get other people to follow – “their format as the  format,” meaning the only one that people should use. Kindo says, “I think I'll just wait until the dust settles.” “To wait until the dust settles” means that you have a situation where thin gs are changing very quickly and they're going to continue to change, so that it  doesn't make any sense for you to try to make a decision now. Just wait until things calm down. Wait until all of the changes are completed and then you can decid e what to do. That's what Kindo is recommending. He’s going to wait until the  “dust settles,” wait until we know which format of e-books will be the winner in this competition. 

Nookie says, “The different formats aren't that big  a deal.” They’re not that important. “You can easily convert a book in one fo rmat to another,” or another format. “To convert” means to change something so t hat you transform it in some way so as to allow you to use it, in this case, on a different e-reader.   

 But Kindo says, “I like the look of text” – or prin ted words – “on a printed page,” on paper page. Nookie says, “You mean that faded te xt on that yellowed page?” When text, when printed words on a piece of paper, become “faded,” they’re more difficult to see. They’re more difficult to re ad. Over time, of course, if you have something in the sun or out in the rain and th en later you try to read it, it might be more difficult because the text has faded.  It is no longer the same easy to see color that it used to be.  

“Yellowed” simply means changing in color from, in this case, white paper to slightly yellow paper. You know how you have an old  book and you open it up and it might be 50 years old? Sometimes you'll see that the paper has become a different color, like a yellow color. That's where this word “yellowed” comes from, as an adjective – a page that is yellow.  

Nookie says, “On an e-book reader, you can adjust t he text size, font, and even line spacing.” Nookie is giving the advantages of a n e-book reader. She's saying you can adjust the “text size” – that's how big the  letters are - “the font” – that's the form of the letter. There are different fonts y ou can use – and “line spacing.” “Line spacing” is the amount of space between one l ine of text and another line of text.  

Kindo says, “Can I get all of the out-of-print book s on my shelves in digital format?” Books that are “out-of-print” are books th at are no longer being made, books that you can no longer buy new. “Out-of-print  books” are books the companies have stopped printing, have stopped makin g.  

Kindo asked Nookie a good question, whether the boo ks that he owns that are out-of-print are available for an e-reader, are ava ilable in electronic format, or as he says, a “digital format.” Nookie says, “Well, I' m not sure.” Kindo says, “Until I can” – meaning until I am able to read all of my ol d books on an e-book reader” – I'll stick to” – or I will stay with – “my low-tech  books.” “Low (low) – tech (tech)” is a term referring to “low technology” – technology t hat is very old, that is very simple, that has, perhaps been around for a long ti me. If you think of books, paper books, as a type of technology, then we’re ta lking about “low-tech,” something that doesn't require electronics or compu ters or anything like that. The opposite of low-tech would be “hi-tech.” “Hi-tech” would be the most sophisticated, advanced computers and other electro nic equipment that are now available. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
