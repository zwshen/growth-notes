This episode is a dialogue about two people who got  into an argument, what we might call a “fight.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alisa:  Don’t be mad.

Sabir:  I’m not mad.

Alisa:  Yes, you are.  I’m sorry.  I admit it was m y fault.  Will you stop moping now?

Sabir:  I’m not moping.  I’m giving you the silent treatment.

Alisa:  I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me.  Wha t can I do to make it up to you?

Sabir:  You can leave me alone.

Alisa:  If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay  the whole incident in your head and the next thing I know, you’ll hold a grudge aga inst me.  Won’t you just forgive me so we can move on?

Sabir:  What you said wasn’t just a slight.  It was  an out-and-out insult.

Alisa:  I know it was and I’m truly sorry.  I’ll bu y you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.

Sabir:  And you won’t say it again?

Alisa:  I promise I’ll never tell you again in fron t of your friends how much you look like Elvis – in his later years.

Alisa says to Sabir, “Don’t be mad.”  Don’t be angr y; don’t be upset.  Sabir says, “I’m not mad.”  Alisa says, “Yes, you are.  I’m sor ry.  I admit it was my fault.”  “To admit” (admit) means to say something is true even though you don’t want to say it’s true, because it’s embarrassing or perhaps you  did something wrong and you don’t want to say you did something wrong, but you have to – you admit it.  “To admit” can also be to say something that perhaps yo u’re not proud of, you’re embarrassed about.  “Admit” has a couple of other m eanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Alisa admits that something was her fault (fault).  “Fault” is responsibility for something bad that has happened.  “Whose fault was it?”  “It was his fault,” he is the person who caused the problem.  Alisa says, “Wi ll you stop moping now?” “To mope” (mope) is to be sad, to be depressed; it’ s also something that a child might do after the child has been yelled at and the n the child is angry, and he’ll go around with a big, sad face and let everyone kno w that he’s sad – that he’s angry.  It’s a negative thing, “to mope,” it means to continue to show how upset or depressed you are to everyone else, even though you should hide that or perhaps simply get over it – stop worrying about it .

Sabir says, “I’m not moping.  I’m giving you the si lent treatment.”  “To give (someone) the silent treatment” means not to speak to someone, to refuse to talk to someone as a way of punishing them, as a way of expressing your anger or your disappointment in them.

Alisa says, “I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me. ”  “To be peeved” (peeved) means to be angry, to be upset, to be mad.  Alisa s ays, “What can I do to make it up to you?”  “To make (something) up to (someone)” is to do something nice for another person after you have done something wrong or after you have hurt them or made them angry or upset.  We might use this expression, for example, in the case of a father who is supposed to go to his daughter’s softball game, and the daughter is very upset when the father can’t ma ke it – doesn’t go to the game.  The father then says to the daughter, “Let m e make it up to you.  Let’s go get some ice cream.”  Or, “Let’s go to McDonald’s a nd eat some terrible food. Let me make it up to you.”  Let me do something nic e for you that will somehow make you forgive me and forget what I did.

Sabir says to Alisa, “You can leave me alone.”  “To  leave (someone) alone” means not to talk to them, not to be with them.  Al isa says, “If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay the whole incident in your head .”  “To stew” (stew) here means to think about something over and over again in you r mind, something that’s negative, something that makes you angry or upset.  We usually use this when someone is angry: “He was stewing in his anger.”  H e was thinking about it and getting more and more angry.  Alisa says that Sabir  will stew and replay the whole incident in his head.  “To replay” means to p lay again.  Normally we use this in talking about listening to a piece of music  or maybe watching a DVD, you’re going to replay a section.  Or if you’re wat ching sports on television and someone makes a good play in a soccer game or a bas eball game, they will replay that part of the game; you will see it again .  We usually call this “instant replay,” they play it over right away, instantly.  Here, “to replay” something means to think about it again and again.  It’s as though you had a DVD player in your head.  Actually, that would be kind of cool, to hav e a DVD player!  You could just put the DVD on top of your head and then…yeah, I li ke that!  Somebody work on that!

Anyway, Alisa says that Sabir will stew and replay the whole incident.  An “incident” (incident) is an event, usually somethin g bad or unpleasant that happens, something that perhaps is embarrassing.  S o, it’s a negative thing, an “incident.”  Don’t confuse this word with “accident ” (accident); an accident is something bad that happens that you didn’t want to happen, that happened not on purpose.  So, an accident could also be an incid ent, but they’re two different ideas.

Well, Alisa says that Sabir will replay the whole, or entire, or complete incident in his head.  “And the next thing I know,” Alisa says,  “you’ll hold a grudge against me.”  A “grudge” (grudge) is when you are angry at someone for a long time; you don’t forget about it.  It could go for days or wee ks or months or even years, where you continue to be angry about something that  someone did to you. Notice the verb we use with this word is “hold,” “t o hold a grudge.”  “Don’t hold a grudge against me.”  Alisa says, “Won’t you just fo rgive me so we can move on?” “To forgive (someone)” is to no longer be angry at someone who did something bad to you.  You hurt me some way, but I forgive yo u.  It’s always better to forgive, otherwise that person continues to hurt yo u because you continue to be bothered by it.  At least that’s what I try to do, but that’s not easy to do.  “To forgive and forget,” we sometimes say.  Well, Alisa  asks Sabir to forgive her, “so we can move on.”  “To move on” here means to forget  about something bad that happened in the past and continue forward – continu e without thinking about the bad things that happened in the past

Sabir says, “What you said wasn’t just a slight.”  A “slight” (slight) is when you insult someone, but it’s not a big insult; when you  say something negative or criticize someone, but it’s not a major criticism, it’s not like you’re saying they’re the ugliest person in the world.  You might say, “W ell, you’re not the best looking person in the world,” that would be a slight.  I gu ess some people would say that’s an insult – a serious insult.  But a slight is less serious.  Sabir says this was not a slight, what Alisa said, “It was an out-and-o ut insult.”  An “insult” is when you say something negative, something critical abou t someone else, saying that they’re stupid or they’re ugly or whatever.  “Out-a nd-out” here means completely, absolutely, without any question.  We might use this expression to talk about someone who is a liar: “He’s and out-and-out liar.”   Or, “That’s an out-and-out lie,” it’s a complete lie.  Why do we say “out-and- out”?  I don’t know, but that’s the expression we use.

Alisa says, “I know it was (I know it was an insult ) and I’m truly sorry.”  She says, “I’ll buy you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.”  “To be contrite” (contrite) means to be sorry for somet hing you have done, to feel sorry for something bad you did.  Sabir says, “And you won’t say it again?”  Alisa says, “I promise I’ll never tell you again in front  of your friends how much you look like Elvis (Elvis the singer) – in his later y ears.”  Well of course, Elvis, as he got older, got fatter and uglier, and to say someon e looks like Elvis in his later years, when he was older, is certainly an insult.  Now, if you said someone looked like Elvis in his younger years, when he was  considered a good-looking man back in the 50s and 60s – early 60s, well, that  would be different.  “In front of” means when your friends are present or when som eone is there in the room. So Alisa said something in front of Sabir’s friends , meaning his friends were there and they could hear what she was saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alisa:  Don’t be mad.

Sabir:  I’m not mad.

Alisa:  Yes, you are.  I’m sorry.  I admit it was m y fault.  Will you stop moping now?

Alisa:  I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me.  Wha t can I do to make it up to you?

 Sabir:  You can leave me alone.

Alisa:  If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay  the whole incident in your head and the next thing I know, you’ll hold a grudge aga inst me.  Won’t you just forgive me so we can move on?

Sabir:  What you said wasn’t just a slight.  It was  an out-and-out insult.

Alisa:  I know it was and I’m truly sorry.  I’ll bu y you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.

Sabir:  And you won’t say it again?

Alisa:  I promise I’ll never tell you again in fron t of your friends how much you look like Elvis – in his later years.
