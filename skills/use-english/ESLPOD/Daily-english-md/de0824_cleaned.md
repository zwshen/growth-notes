This episode is a dialogue about getting someone re ady to become the leader of a company or of an organization.  Let’s get started . 

[start of dialogue] 

Aisha:  It’s only a matter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.   

Javier:  That won’t happen for years. 

Aisha:  It’ll happen sooner than you think.  I’ve g iven a lot of thought to the person I want to fill my shoes.  After long conside ration, I think that person should be you. 

Javier:  Me?  But there are a lot of people who out rank me in this organization and who have more experience.   

Aisha:  That may be true, but I’ve decided to make you my protégé.  I’m taking you under my wing starting now to groom as my succe ssor. 

Javier:  I don’t know what to say.  I’m honored, of  course, but aren’t you going to meet with a lot of resistance by choosing me instea d of someone more senior? 

Aisha:  I might, but I have confidence in you.  Wit h a little time, you’ll come into your own and you’ll make a fine leader for this org anization. 

Javier:  All I can say is thank you for having fait h in me.   

Aisha:  The opportunity is yours and it’s up to you  what you make of it.   

Javier:  I know that this is a once-in-a-lifetime o pportunity.  I won’t let you down.   

Aisha:  I’m counting on that.   

[end of dialogue] 

Aisha begins our dialogue by saying, “It’s only a m atter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.”  The expressi on “it’s only a matter of time” is used to describe something that will definitely happen in the future but you don’t know exactly when, but it will happen.  “It’s  only a matter of time before Miss Universe calls me and asks me for some persona l English lessons.”  It’s only a matter of time; it will happen, I just don’t  know when.  Aisha says it’s only a matter of time before she retires.  “To retire” (re tire) means to stop working, basically to stop working for the rest of your life .  So when you are 65 or 70 you often – at least in the United States at those ages  – will retire; you will quit your job and you will no longer work full-time.  At leas t that’s the way it traditionally has been, we’ll see what happens in the future, dep ending on our economy. 

Aisha is planning on retiring, and when she does sh e will hand over the reins (reins).  “To hand over (something)” is a phrasal v erb meaning to give something to someone else.  The “reins” – (reins), not (rains ) – is what you use to control a horse.  They’re the little ropes that you hold onto  that you use to control a horse, to turn it from one side to the other.  Here, it me ans the control of something, so Aisha will hand over control of the organization or  the company to someone else.   

Javier says, “That won’t happen for years.”  You wo n’t be retiring for many years, he says.  Aisha, however, has different ideas.  She  says, “It will happen sooner than you think.”  She actually says, “It’ll happen, ” “it’ll” being a contraction for “it will.”  “It will happen sooner than you think,” soo ner than you might imagine.  She says, “I’ve given a lot of thought,” meaning I thou ght about something a lot, “I’ve given a lot of thought to the person I want to fill  my shoes.”  “To fill (someone’s) shoes” means to perform the same duties and the sam e activities as another person normally does.  So, when someone leaves as p resident, the next person becomes president fills his or her shoes; he does o r she does what that other person used to do.  Aisha says, “After long conside ration,” meaning after thinking about it very carefully for a long time, “I think t hat person should be you,” meaning you should be the next leader of this organ ization. 

Javier says, “Me?”  He’s surprised.  I’m kind of su rprised, too.  Javier, eh, not that intelligent I don’t think!  Anyway, he says, “But t here are a lot of people who outrank me in this organization.”  “To outrank” (ou trank – one word) means to have a higher position or to have greater authority  in an organization.  So, a  

company might have a president, it might have a cou ple of vice-presidents, and then it might have some managing directors.  Well, the president outranks the vice-president; he or she is higher in the organiza tion than the vice-president, and the vice-presidents outrank the managers.  Javi er is saying there are other people in this company who outrank him and who have  more experience.   

Aisha says, “That may be true,” meaning maybe you’r e right, “but I’ve decided to make you my protégé.”  “Protégé” (protégé) is a per son who receives support, advice, and guidance from an older, more experience d person, especially as preparation for that person to take over the job of  the older person.  So someday when I get old – I mean really old, not old like I am now – someday when I get really old I will probably find a young version of me – a young Jeff McQuillan – and I will make him my protégé.  I will train that person so they can take over as ESL Podcast’s host many years now – many, many year s from now, however. Aisha says, “I’m taking you under my wing (Javier). ”  “To take (someone) under your wing” (wing) means to begin to make someone yo ur protégé, to begin to take that person and give them advice, give them su ggestions, give them guidance.  It’s something that an older person woul d do for a younger person in an organization.   

Aisha’s going to take Javier under her wing, and sh e’s going to groom him as her successor.  “To groom” (groom) here means to prepar e another person to do a certain job, often your job.  It’s similar to takin g someone under your wing or making someone your protégé.  In this case, Aisha i s going to groom Javier as her successor (successor).  I should mention the wo rd “groom” has a couple of different meanings – very different.  Take a look a t our Learning Guide for those. I don’t want you to use that word in the wrong way,  take a look at the Learning Guide.  A “successor” is the person who takes over your job, the person who comes after someone else as the person taking that job. 

Javier says, “I don’t know what to say.”  He’s surp rised.  He says, “I’m honored, of course,” meaning here sort of I’m flattered or I  feel very good about you telling me this, “but aren’t you going to meet with a lot o f resistance by choosing me instead of someone more senior?”  Javier is asking Aisha if she’s going to meet a lot of resistance, meaning people are going to oppo se her, people are going to be against her decision.  The reason they would be against her decision is because Javier is not the most senior person in the  company.  “Senior” (senior) here means to have more experience in the company.  Usually that means you’re older.  It doesn’t mean that you are what we call a  “senior citizen,” that would be someone over, say, 65 or 70 years old.  Here it jus t means someone with more experience at that organization, or in that organiz ation. 

Aisha says, “I might, (I might meet some resistance ) but I have confidence in you.  With a little time, you’ll come into your own  and you’ll make a fine leader for this organization.”  The phrase “to come into your own” means to achieve the level of ability or competence in something that yo u are able to succeed at a job or succeed in a certain position.  “To come into yo ur own” means to mature, to get the necessary experience so that now you are re ady to do this job. 

Javier says, “All I can say is thank you for having  faith in me.”  “To have faith (faith) in (someone)” means to believe in someone, to believe that someone can do something.   

Aisha says, “The opportunity is yours and it’s up t o you what you make of it.” When we say something is “up to” someone – “it’s up  to you,” “it’s up to John,” “it’s up to Phil” – we mean that’s the person who h as the power to make something happen, to make something succeed or fail .  It’s the same as saying “it depends upon you” or “it depends on what you do .”  “It’s up to you to go and study harder to pass your test.”  It’s not somethin g I can do, it’s only something you can do; you’re the one that has that power.  Ai sha says it’s up to Javier what he makes of it.  The expression “what you make of ( something)” means what you do with an opportunity, how you take advantage of a  chance – an opportunity to do something.  “What will you make it?”  How will y ou use this opportunity?   

Javier says, “I know that this is a once-in-a-lifet ime opportunity.”  “Once in a lifetime” means it only happens once in your entire  life.  Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would be an opportunity – a chance – th at will only happen once in your life.  Javier says, “I won’t let you down.”  “ To let (someone) down” (down) means to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s expectations.  Aisha says, “I’m counting on that.”  To count on (something)” m eans to rely on, to depend on something.  “I’m counting on you to finish this job .”  I’m relying on you; I’m depending on you. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
