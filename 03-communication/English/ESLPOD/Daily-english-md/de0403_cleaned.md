This episode is called “Understanding Drug Labels.”  It’s a dialogue between Bernie and Gloria about some typical vocabulary that you  will find if you are looking at medication; that is, drugs.  This can be very i mportant, especially if you are in an English-speaking country and need to takes some d rugs that you buy, so let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Bernie:  Oh, I’m in so much pain!  Where is the medicat ion we got from the pharmacy? 

Gloria:  It’s right here, but we need to read the la bel first.  Okay, these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.  This warning says th at we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.  It also says to ask your docto r before using it if you have heart problems.   

Bernie:  I don’t.  Can you just give me the medication ?   

Gloria:  I’m checking to make sure the seal under the c ap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side.  I also need to read the dosage info rmation so you’ll know how much to take.  It says, “Adults (12 years or older): Two t ablets every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.”   

Bernie:  That’s fine.  That’s fine.  Where is the pre scription medication from my doctor? 

Gloria:  Here it is.  This one has several warnings.  It says that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness.  It also says, “This drug may impair you r ability to drive.”  

 Bernie:  I don’t plan to drive today or any day soon.  N ow will you please give me my medication? 

Gloria:  I will as soon as I get this childproof cap of f. 

Bernie:  I may be dead by then!

We’re talking, in this episode, about drug labels.  A “ label” is a small piece of paper, usually that is put on the medicine bottle – the  container where the medicine is kept.  The label has writing on it that give s you the name of the product, in this case, the drug.  You can also have labels on cans, things that have food inside of them, and so forth.  “Label” is a g eneral term for a little piece of paper that tells you what is inside something. 

Bernie begins by saying, “Oh, I’m in so much pain (I’m in  a lot of pain)!  Where is the medication we got from the pharmacy?” he asks.  “Medi cation” is just another word for medicine or drugs.  It’s a liquid or a pill t hat you would, perhaps, “swallow,” or put into your body to make you feel bette r.  A “pharmacy” is a store that sells medicine and other drugs; we sometimes call it a “drugstore.”  The two terms, “pharmacy” and “drugstore” in the U.S. are used “interchangeably,” meaning you can use one for the other; it doesn’t matte r.  Some people call a pharmacy only that part of the store, or only a story tha t sells drugs that you need a prescription for.  A “prescription” is basically permission  from a doctor that says you can take this drug. 

Gloria says, “It’s right here, but we need to read the label first.  Okay,” she says, “these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.”  The  “active ingredients” are the things that you put into a drug that actually m akes you healthier – that makes you better.  Drugs sometimes have other ingredient s that are used, but the active ingredients are the most important ones.  An “ingredient” is what you use to make something else, usually something you eat.  So , you can talk about the ingredients of a salad, which would be lettuce, tom atoes, etc. 

Gloria says, “This warning says that we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.”  A “warning” is a statement describing some da nger, something bad that might happen.  It’s letting you know that there m ight be a problem and yet you need to be careful.  To “watch out for” something means to make sure something doesn’t happen, usually something dangerous to make that it sure doesn’t happen, or to be looking for this bad thing.  For example, “Watch out for  

 the cars on the street,” you might say to a child crossing the street.  “Watch out for” means look for something, in this case, something that could be dangerous. 

The “allergic reactions” are things that the body does w hen it is exposed to certain kinds of chemicals or other things; it’s a bad thin g that happens to the body.  Some people have allergic reactions to, for exampl e, the drug penicillin. Their body doesn’t like the drug, and so they will have  this reaction.  Maybe their skin will turn red or they’ll have difficulty breathing; these are allergic reactions. “Allergic” comes from the word “allergy” (allergy), whi ch are things that bother you, often causing you to sneeze or to have difficulty breat hing, for example. 

The dialogue continues by Gloria saying the label “also s ays to ask your doctor before using it if you have heart problems.”  Some medi cines you can’t use because you have other medical conditions, so this would be  an example of that. Bernie says, “I don’t (I don’t have any heart problems).  Can you just give me the medication?”  Bernie, remember, is feeling pain so he wants the drug right away. Gloria, however, says, “I’m checking to make sure the seal  under the cap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side.”  In medicine sold in the United States, there’s almost always a “seal” on the top of the bottle.  This i s a small piece of plastic that is put on the bottle so that nothing can be put in or nothing can be taken out. This is for safety reasons, so no one tries to hurt you by putting something in your medication that you don’t know about that is bad fo r you.  This, unfortunately, has happened in the past.  The “cap” is t he top of the bottle.  It’s also sometimes called a “lid,” depending on how it’s put  on the bottle.  But, a cap is usually something that you turn to take off, and then you can get inside of the bottle.  Both “seal” and “cap” have a couple of diffe rent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional expla nations. 

So, Gloria says she’s checking the seal under the cap to make sure it isn’t broken, meaning that someone hasn’t taken the seal off,  that someone hasn’t put something bad into the bottle.  She says she wants “to b e on the safe side.”  The expression “to be on the safe side” means that you are tryi ng to make sure something bad doesn’t happen.  Even though it might no t be necessary to do this, you want to be safe; you want to be extra cautious – extra safe. 

Gloria says, “I also need to read the dosage information  so you’ll know how much to take.”  The “dosage” (dosage) is how much medicine you  should take, and how often.  It may be one pill in the morning and on e pill in the afternoon; that would be the “dosage.”  The dosage says: “Adults (12 or older): Two tablets (two pills) every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 ho urs.”  To “exceed” (exceed) means to do or to take more of something than yo u should.  So, if it  

 says “do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours,” that means tha t you should not take more than 12 pills in one day. 

Bernie says, “That’s fine.  That’s fine.  Where is the pr escription medication from my doctor?”  A “prescription,” we already know, is special m edicine the doctor gives you that you need the doctor’s permission for in orde r to buy.  Gloria says, “Here it is.”  She says, “This one has several warnings.  I t says that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness.”  Sometimes certain pills – certain m edications cause you to be “drowsy” (drowsy).  That’s just another word for  “sleepy,” feeling very tired.  “Dizziness” is a feeling that everything in the ro om is moving around you, usually in circles, when, in fact, nothing is moving.  Di zziness can cause you to fall down.   

So, some drugs may cause dizziness, and you have to be careful .  Gloria says that the label on this bottle says, “This drug may impai r your ability to drive.”  To “impair” (impair) means to make something worse, or to  make something not work as well as it normally does.  If you say, “Her vision is impaired,” we mean she doesn’t see as well as she should.  So, the “drug ma y impair your ability to drive,” it may make you unable to drive as well as you shou ld. 

Bernie says, “I don’t plan to drive today or any day soon.   Now will you please give me my medication?”  Gloria says, “I will (I will give  it to you) as soon as I get this childproof cap off.”  Something that is “childproo f” (one word) is a container that is designed to be difficult for a young child to open.  This is especially important for drugs.  We don’t want young children go ing into your room and opening up a pill bottle and hurting themselves by takin g this drug, so most drugs have a childproof top.  The joke is that the childproof top is often very difficult even for an adult to get off, and so some people compl ain about that. 

Gloria is having difficulty getting the childproof cap of f.  Bernie says, “I may be dead by then!” meaning by the time you have the cap off it will be too late, I’ll be dead, because, of course, Bernie has been waiting all this time to get the pain medication. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Bernie:  Oh, I’m in so much pain!  Where is the medicat ion we got from the pharmacy? 

 Gloria:  It’s right here, but we need to read the la bel first.  Okay, these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.  This warning says th at we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.  It also says to ask your docto r before using it if you have heart problems.

Bernie:  I may be dead by then!
