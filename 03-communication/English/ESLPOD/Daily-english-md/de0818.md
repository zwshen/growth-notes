On this episode, we're going to listen to a convers ation between Joel and someone who works at a restaurant. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Server:  Hello, I’m Allie and I’ll be your server t oday. Here’s a menu. Can I take your drink order?

Joel:  I’d like a glass of water with no ice.

Server:  Sure. Will that be sparkling or still?

Joel:  Uh, tap.

Server:  Okay, one glass of tap water. Would you li ke anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade...

Joel:  I’d like a Diet Coke.

Server:  Sure, I’ll be right back with your drinks in just one moment.

Joel:  Can you bring me a wine list?

Server:  No problem. Here is your water and Diet Co ke, and this is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular? We have  an extensive selection and some very fine house wines.

Joel:  I’m looking for the kind I drink at home.

Server:  What label is the wine you drink at home?

Joel:  I don’t remember the name, but it has a very  distinctive packaging.

Server:  Oh, can you describe it?

Joel:  Sure, it’s a large white box...

Server:  You mean it’s a boxed wine?

Joel:  Yes, that’s right.

Server:  I’m sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.

Joel:  And you call yourself a restaurant?

[end of dialogue]

Joel is sitting in a restaurant and a woman comes u p to him. She’s the waitress. We would also more generally call this the “server. ” The “server” (server) is the person who serves you your food, usually also the p erson who asks you what you want. We would use the expression “takes your o rder,” – asks you what you want to eat and drink and then gets those things for you.” That’s a server or a “waitress”, if it's a woman, a “waiter” (waiter), i f it's a man.

So, the waitress or server says, “Hello, I'm Allie, ” that’s her name “and I'll be your server today.” This is kind of become a common way that waiters and waitresses approach someone who comes to the restaurant and si ts down when they first walk up to you. They may give you their name.  Now,  personally I don’t usually remember their name, so giving me their name doesn’ t help me much, but that’s what some restaurants, a lot of restaurants, do now . The server will give her name or his name and tell you something obvious, li ke they’ll be your server today! The server says – Allie says – see? I rememb ered her name! – says, “Here's a menu. Can I take your drink order?” Your “drink order” would be what you want to drink.

Joel says, “I’d like a glass of water with no ice.”  “I'd like” is the same as “I'll have” which is the same as “I want.” Here's what I want t o order. Here's what I want you to bring me. “I'd like a glass of water with no  ice.” The server says, “Sure.” Okay. “Will that be sparkling or still?” When you g o to a nicer restaurant, you can get your water “sparkling” which means (the technic al word here would be “carbonated”) it has bubbles in it. “Still” would b e non-carbonated, without

bubbles, but still perhaps from a bottle. Joel howe ver says he wants “tap” (tap). Tap water is water that you just get from the sink.  So, there are three kinds of water you could get. Tap water would be just regula r water from a sink (or a faucet in a sink, technically – that’s the thing th at the water comes out of). Bottled water can be either still water or sparkling water.  Sparkling water has the “bubbles” in it, if you will.

The server says, “Okay, one glass of tap water. Wou ld you like anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade…” She starts listi ng all of the kinds of drinks that they have at this restaurant. “Soda” (soda), s ometimes called “soda pop” or in Minnesota, where I'm from, we say simply “pop.” It's a sweet carbonated (with bubbles) “beverage” or drink. Coca Cola, 7-Up, Peps i – those are all examples of soda. “Iced tea” is tea that is made the normal way  with hot water, but then you put it into ice and it becomes iced tea. Iced tea i s very popular in the summertime. “Lemonade” is a drink made by mixing the juice of a lemon, a fruit, with water and sugar. Lemonade is also very popular  in the summertime in the U.S.

Joel, however, says he wants a Diet Coke. When you order a drink that is “diet,” usually you're ordering it without all of the sugar . It has what we would say “fewer calories.” It's not as bad for you. It won't make y ou as fat. That’s really the idea. So, a lot of people like me who don’t want all of t he extra sugar will order a soda in its diet version, so Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. So metimes different soda companies have different names for this. There's a type of soda in the U.S. called Coke Zero. Well, that’s really another kind of Diet  Coke, but there's also a separate kind of Coke called Diet Coke. It's very c onfusing!

The server says, “Sure, I'll be right back,” meanin g I'll return quickly “with your drinks in just one moment,” in just a minute. Joel says, “Can you bring me a wine list?” The “wine list,” as it sounds, is a menu of the kinds of wine that you can purchase or buy at a restaurant or at a bar. Again,  a nicer restaurant will typically have a wine list that you can order from. I don’t g o to very many nice restaurants, so I don’t have a lot of experience with the wine l ist. When I do get a wine list, I don’t usually open it because I don’t drink wine ty pically for dinner. I have sometimes.

The server says to Joel’s request for the wine list , she says, “No problem,” which is sort of an informal way of saying “Oh sure, of c ourse.” Then she says, “Here is your water and Diet Coke.” So, she goes away back t o the kitchen and she gets some water, tap water, and a glass of Diet Coke. An d she says, “This is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular?” That is, is there a specific kind of wine that you like? She says, “We have an extensive  selection and some very

fine house wines.” “An extensive selection” would b e a lot of different kinds of wine. “Extensive” means large or many of or somethi ng that is very complete. So, this restaurant has an “extensive selection” meanin g an extensive number of different wines that you can order and she says (“A llie,” right?), Allie says, “some very fine house wines.” A “house wine” is not a win e that comes from your house. It's a wine that the restaurant sells usually by the glass. You can buy a bottle of wine in a restaurant or you can just buy (in many r estaurants) a glass of wine. Usually the house wine is not the most expensive on e. It's usually not a famous brand, a famous kind of wine, but it's – if it's a good restaurant, usually a good wine, not the best wine they have, however.

Joel says, “I'm looking for the kind I drink at hom e.” So, here Joel is saying that he wants the kind of wine that he also drinks at hi s house, so in some ways this is kind of a house wine, but that’s not the normal definition of house wine. In fact, the word “house” has a couple of different meanings . Take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those. Joel says he’s lookin g for the kind of wine that he drinks at home, so Allie asks him, “What label is t he wine you drink at home?” The “label” (label) is literally the piece of paper  or sticker on the outside of the wine bottle that tells you what kind of wine it is and what company made the wine. When we use it in this case, when someone say s, “What label is the wine?”, they mean what kind of wine, what company m ade the wine that you're interested in.

Joel says, “I don’t remember the name, but it has a  very distinctive packaging.” “Distinctive” means it's very easy to recognize. It  is something that as soon as you see it you know exactly what it is. “Packaging”  is the way that you sell a certain physical product. So, when you buy cereal, it comes in a box. The box is its packaging. It's the thing that you put it in, t he container, typically. Joel says that the wine he drinks at home has a very distinct ive packaging. The server says, “Oh, can you describe it?” Joel says, “Sure, it's a large white box.” The server says, “You mean it's a boxed wine?” A “boxed  wine” is a very cheap wine you can buy. Usually it is sold in a box. It's the cheapest, least expensive, and lowest quality kind of wine you could possibly buy,  not a very good wine.

Joel says, “Yes, that’s right.” It's a boxed wine. The server says, “I'm sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.” If you go to a restaur ant and they have boxed wines, it's probably not a very good restaurant, an d this is a good restaurant, so they don’t have any boxed wines. Joel is not happy.  He says, “And you call yourself a restaurant?” This expression, usually in  the form of a question, “And you call yourself (something),” is a phrase we use in a rude sort of way, or it could just be in a joking way, to question how some one has described himself. For example, I come from Minnesota where it's cold in the winter, so when I go

say to a warm place like here in California, people  expect me to be used to the cold. So, if it gets a little cold out and I say, “ Oh, it’s terrible here, it's freezing, it's really cold” and I start complaining, my family or other people who know I'm from Minnesota might say, “And you call yourself a Minne sotan?” meaning you're not really a Minnesotan. You're not really from Minneso ta if you think that, say, 50 degrees Fahrenheit is cold. So, Joel is saying here  that this isn't a real restaurant if they don’t have boxed wine. Of course, Joel is a  little crazy, so that’s the reason for that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
