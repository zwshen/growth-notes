<p>The European Football Championship is coming! From the 12th of June to the
4th of July, Portugal will be the sports center of the world. Everyone will do their best to make this event a memorable one.

However, an important detail is missing. The rules for the classification
of the league stage have changed and everyone is a little bit confused.
What would be really, really nice would be a computer program to calculate
this classification, given the results of the game. Then it would also be
possible to watch in real time the changes in the ranking!

<p>Here is how the classification is made:

<ol>
<li>For a win 3 points will be awarded; for a tie, 1 point; for a defeat, 0 points
<li>For establishing the final places, the following criteria will be
    applied, in descending order of priority:
  <ul>
  <li> Number of points
  <li> Goal-Average (difference between goals scored and given)
  <li> Number of wins (victories)
  <li> Number of goals scored
  </ul>
</ol>

<p>So after the games are taken in account, this parameters are 
all calculated. Things get interesting when there is more
than one team with the same number of points. In that case,
a sub-league is considered. You must now imagine that only the games
between the tied teams count, and see the new sub-classification. If
that does not break the tie (in points) for all the teams, you must do a
sub-sub-league for all the teams that are still tied, and so on. There
is only one case when a sub-league should not be partitioned. That is when
all the teams in that sub-league have the same number of points and
obviously, the partition would give the exact same group of teams and
parameters. In that cases, teams should be ranked according to the
four parameters calculated for that sub-league. If the parameters are not
sufficient, then the teams should be considered to be in the same place,
and they should appear in alphabetical order.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>

<p>Your task is to write a program that given the results of several games,
calculates the classification of the teams using the sorting algorithm
defined above.

<p>Of course that knowing how good programmer you are, the organization
has asked you to make a program that could calculate the classification
of thousands of teams more than the ones that will be present in Euro'2004,
in order to use the program in any situation they want.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b> which is the
number of test cases that follow.

<p>Each test case starts with a number <b>G</b> (<i>1 &le; G &le; 10000</i>)
indicating the number of games to consider.

<p>Then <i>G</i> lines follow, each one with the format <tt>"TEAM1 TEAM2 GOALS1 GOALS2"</tt>, giving the result of a single game (<tt>TEAM1</tt> scored
<tt>GOALS1</tt> goals and <tt>TEAM2</tt> scored <tt>GOALS2</tt>). Team names
are made only by lower-case letters and have a maximum length of 20.

<p>It is not necessary that games between all the teams have been made. Of course that you should only calculate the classification based on the games that
you were given. Also, some teams may play against each other more than one
time.

<p>To make the classification you should consider all the teams that played
at least one game. You may assume that the number of teams is &le; 10000

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<p>The output for each test case consists of lines in the form
<tt>"PLACE TEAM"</tt>, in ascending order of place, where <t>PLACE</tt>
indicates the place the team got and <tt>TEAM</tt> is the name of the team.
Remember that all teams that played at least one game must appear.

<p>Output of different test cases should be separated by a single blank line.

<p>See the example output for a more detailed explanation of how the
classification was obtained on that particular cases.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Explanation of Sample I/O</H2></FONT>

<ul>

<li>First sample case:
<p>Looking at the games, we see that <tt>"portugal"</tt>,
<tt>"espanha"</tt> and <tt>"grecia"</tt> made 6 points, and
<tt>"russia"</tt> made 0 points (which automatically gives them
the 4th place). A tie between the first three teams is achieved. A sub-league
with only that three teams is then considered but in this sub-league
all the three teams have 3 points. This tied group cannot be partitioned
further and then the other parameters are considered. Since in that
sub-league, <tt>"portugal"</tt> has the best goal-average,
it achieves 1st place. Then comes <tt>"spain"</tt> (2nd goal-average) and
finally <tt>"grecia"</tt>. If necessary, the other parameters would have been taken in account.

<li>Second sample case:
<p>Now, <tt>"portugal"</tt> and <tt>"grecia"</tt> are tied with 6 points, and
<tt>"espanha" and "russia"</tt> have 3 points. The sub-league between
<tt>"portugal"</tt> and <tt>"grecia"</tt> unties the two teams
(<tt>"portugal"</tt> won against <tt>"grecia"</tt>), and in the same way
the sub-league between <tt>"espanha" and "russia"</tt> unties them.

<li>Third sample case:
<p>The only two teams tied the game, so they are equal in all parameters. They
are in the same place and they appear in alphabetical order.
