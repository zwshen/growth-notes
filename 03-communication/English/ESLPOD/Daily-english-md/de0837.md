This episode is a dialogue between Pamela and Josh who are calling and texting and doing all sorts of things when they shouldn’t b e doing them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pamela:  [laughs] Did you see this tweet from Sarah ? She’s so funny.

Josh:  Hold on. I’m texting Lance. I want to make s ure he knows where we’re meeting up.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Oh, hi Lance. Did  you get Josh’s text? You didn’t? Let me IM you, bye.

Josh:  I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text. I sen t it from the same number I normally use.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Jessica! Where ha ve you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days. I thought you’d fallen  off the face of the earth. What? You’ve been on vacation with your parents and you’v e been incommunicado, with no web access and no phone signal? That’s mind -blowing!

Josh:  Ask Jessica whether she  got my text. I’m really starting to worry about my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us ri ght now. Say “cheese.”

Pamela:  Cheese. [brakes squealing] What was that?

Josh:  It’s just a reckless driver. Just change lan es.

Pamela:  You change lanes. You’re the one driving.

 Josh:  No, I’m not. How can I be driving when I’m s o busy texting?

[end of dialogue]

Pamela and Josh are talking. Pamela says, “Did you see this tweet from Sarah. She’s so funny.” A “tweet” (tweet) is a message of a hundred and forty characters – sort of like a hundred and forty letters and spac es – that is sent through a service called “Twitter” (twitter) – which many of you are probably familiar with. I’ve been on twitter since, oh, 2006, maybe 2007 – eslpod, of course, is where you can find us on Twitter. Pamela is talking about  a tweet – a message that she got from a friend of hers, we assume, Sarah, Josh s ays, “Hold on” – wait a minute – “I’m texting Lance.” “To text” (text) is to send a short text message on your telephone, on your cellular telephone – your m obile phone – to someone else. Josh says, “I want to make sure he” – his fri end lance – “knows where we’re meeting up.” “To meet up” is a phrasal verb that ra lly just means to meet someone. But “meet up” – with a (up) at the end – is a little more informal. Usually, it means we’re going to go and we don’t ha ve any particular plans. It’s not a business meeting. It’s more of an informal – social meeting – you might say.

Pamela answers her cell phone and says, “Hello? Oh,  hi Lance. Did you get Josh’s text?” – Did you receive the text that Josh just sent you – “You didn’t?” “Let me IM you. Bye.” “IM” or as a verb – “to IM” m eans to send someone an instant message. “IM” stands for instant message or  instant messaging. A lot of online programs allow you to send IM’s and they get  to the other person immediately. Josh says, “I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text? I sent it from the same number I normally use.” “The same number” here  means the same phone number and in some ways, Josh is saying, from the s ame phone or the same phone account. “Number” has a lot of different mean ings in English however. Take a look at our Leaning Guide for some more of t hose.

Pamela’s cell phone rings again and she says, “Hell o. Jessica. Where have you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days.” – I’v e been sending you emails – electronic messages you send through your computer,  of course. Pamela says, “I thought you’d fallen off the face of the earth.” Th is is an old expression – “to fall of the face of the earth” – means to disappear for a period of time without telling anyone where you’re going, without communicating wi th your family or your friends. “She fell off the face of the earth” – she  just disappeared. No one knows where she is. Pamela says to Jessica that she thoug ht Jessica had fallen off the face of the earth. Of course, we don’t hear what Je ssica is saying. We just hear what Pamela is saying on the phone. She says, “What ? You’ve been on vacation

with your parents and you’ve been incommunicado? Wi th no web access and no phone signal?” The term “incommunicado” (incommunic ado) means that you are not able to communicate with other people – that yo u are not able to be in contact with other people. You don’t have a phone o r in this case, in Jessica’s case, she didn’t have any “web access.” “Web” here means Internet. She didn’t have any ability to connect to the Internet – to ge t on an Internet connection. She had no web access and “no phone signal,” meaning wh erever she was, there was no cellular or mobile phone signal – no ability  to use your phone because there simply isn’t any equipment from a telephone –  a mobile telephone company that you can communicate with.

Pamela says, “That’s mind-blowing!” “Mind-blowing” (blowing) is something that is very surprising – something that is very hard to  believe. Something that’s almost extraordinary.” It’s almost impossible – tha t’s mind-blowing,” or “That was a mind-blowing movie.” We can also use this as a ve rb – “to blow someone’s mind,” or “That really blew my mind.” “Blew” (blew)  is the past tense of blow. It’s irregular. “It blew my mind” – it was something tha t surprised me or shocked me – something I wasn’t expecting. Josh then says to P amela, “Ask Jessica whether she got my text. I’m really starting to worry about  my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us right now. Say ‘cheese!’” “Better  yet” is an expression that means even better. We use it to emphasize that what  we are going to say next is even a better idea than the idea we just told you. So, for example, I may say, “Let’s go to the movies. Better yet, let’s go to Ho llywood and make a movie or be in a movie.” You see, the second idea is better tha n the first. Why just go to a movie when you can come here to Hollywood, in Los A ngeles and make a movie, right? Well, that’s the general idea of “better yet .”

Josh says that he’s starting to worry about his acc ount. He’s not sure if his text messages are being sent out properly from his phone  number, from his phone account. So, he suggests sending Jessica a photo of  Josh and Pamela. And so, he takes a photo – a photograph, a picture – of him self and Jessica. And when you take a photograph in English, of someone else a nd you want them to smile, we use the word “cheese.” So, “Say cheese!” Because  when you say the word “cheese” (cheese) – a type of food – you have to op en your mouth and you can see your teeth when you say that word. Pamela says,  “Cheese!” And then we hear the brakes squealing. “To squeal” (squeal) is a very high-pitched sound. You heard the sound in the dialogue. “Squeal” is a verb we would use to describe noise that is being made by tires of a car or autom obile when you suddenly have to stop. The tires are, of course, the four circula r pieces of rubber on each corner of the car that go on the wheels. When you have to stop suddenly, your tires may squeal or if you leave suddenly. You suddenly try to go fast when you are not

moving – you go fast quickly – that could cause you r tires to squeal – to make a noise. Basically, it’s the noise made by a wheel ag ainst the street.

Pamela says, “What was that?” Josh says, “It’s just  a reckless driver.” Now, of course, we hadn’t really realized in the dialogue u ntil now that Pamela and Josh are driving while they’re doing all this tweeting a nd texting and IM-ing and phone calling and taking photos. A “reckless (reckless) p erson” is someone who’s not careful, who’s not cautious – who’s doing something  dangerous. And, of course, the joke here is that Josh and Pamela are doing som ething very dangerous, or at least Josh is, if he’s driving. And he’s saying tha t the other driver was being reckless. Josh says, “Just change lanes.” So, just is telling Pamela to move to a different part of the road. A “lane” is a section of a road. Here in Los Angeles, we have freeways, highways that have three, four, five  lanes on each side. So, there are five places that a car can go in a certain dire ction. Pamela is being told by Josh to “change lanes” – to go from one lane to ano ther – one section of the road to another.

Well, of course, we thought that Josh was driving a nd that’s what Pamela says, “You change lanes, you’re the one driving.” Josh sa ys, “No I’m not. How can I be driving when I’m so busy texting?” Josh saying he c an’t be the one driving because he’s texting. Of course, the joke here, whi ch is not such a joke, is that it can be very dangerous to be doing all these things while you’re driving. And here in the United States, especially here in California , it is now illegal to be texting and driving at the same time. The amazing thing is you actually have to tell people not to do that. People are so stupid, they d on’t realize that you shouldn’t be texting and driving at the same time but people are stupid everywhere and apparently, especially here in California.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

Pamela:  [laughs] Did you see this tweet from Sarah ? She’s so funny.
