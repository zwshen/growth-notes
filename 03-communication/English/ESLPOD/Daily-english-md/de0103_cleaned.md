Last week, I was at a business luncheon and I met a  woman named Dana Okri who was heading a new start up. I have been a sales  rep for Eureka Corp. for three years now and our bread and butter is data ma nagement software. I told her briefly about our products over lunch and she h ad given me her card.  

I decided to follow up with a call. I dialed her di rect line and fortunately, I got a hold of her on the first try.  

Dana: Hello, Dana Okri. 

Kevin: Hello, Dana, this is Kevin Abrahams from Eur eka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Cham ber of Commerce luncheon. 

Dana: Oh, yes. Hi. How are you? 

Kevin: Great. Do you have a few minutes right now f or me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company ha s to offer? It won't take long. 

Dana: Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I' ll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send m e? 

Kevin: Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send  you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a c ompany your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any quest ions? 

Dana: Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll g et a chance to read the material, why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going to this meeting.  

Kevin: No problem at all. I won't keep you any long er. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there. 

Dana: Sounds good.

Our story begins with a man talking about how he wa s at a “business luncheon” and he met a woman named Dana who was “heading a ne w start up.” A “business luncheon” “luncheon” (luncheon) is a form al business lunch, usually with many people. The woman was named “Dana.” In ot her words, her name was “Dana,” and she was “heading a new start up.” “ To be heading something” means to be the boss, the person who is organizing and leading it. A “start up” – a “start up” is two words, it’s a noun which refers  to a new company. Particularly in the Internet world, we talk about “start ups,” m eaning new Internet companies, but it can also just mean any new company, a “start  up.”  

The man says he’s a “sales rep” for Eureka Corp. A “sales rep” (rep) – “rep” stands here for “representative,” so when someone s ays they’re a “sales rep,” they mean they are “sales representative,” which is  just another name for a salesperson, someone who sells for a company. He me ntioned that the “bread and butter” of their company, his company, is data management software. The expression, “our bread and butter,”  means this is where we make most of our money. This is the most important part of our busin ess. So, a business can have many different branches or divisions or sections bu t usually, there’s one, what you might call “core” (core), or main principal, pr imary business and that’s where you make your most money. And that’s what the expre ssion here means “our bread and butter.” It means that’s what where we ea rn the money to – literally, to buy our bread and butter, is the original, I’m sure , connection. 

“Data management software” is a computer program th at helps people organize information. The woman gives the sales rep her “car d,” meaning her business card, and the man decides to follow up their conver sation with a “call.” The verb, “follow up” or “to follow up,” is used when you tal k to someone or have a  

conversation or an email and you agree to do someth ing or you have an appointment or something that you need to continue talking about. One of the people in the conversation may “follow up,” that is  I talk to you on Monday and you say you’re going to think about buying one of m y products. I call back on Friday to “follow up,” in other words, to check, to  see if you are still interested. And you can use this expression in lots of differen t places. Sometimes, for example, if you go to the doctor and the doctor say s, “Hmm, well, you’re okay now but I want you to come back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment.” Here it’s used as an adjective. “This is an appointment so that I can check you again.” So, that’s the meaning of follow up. “With a call,”  of course, means with a telephone call. 

He says he dials her “direct line” and fortunately he got hold of her on the first try. “To dial” means, of course, to dial in a telephone.  To press the numbers means “to dial.” The “direct line” -- in a company that h as many different people working in it, often times, you have a general number where  you call, and you get a secretary or the operator, and you have to ask for somebody in the company that you want to speak with. The “direct line” would be the number directly to that person. You don’t have to go through the operator. The man says he fortunately, “got a hold of” the woman on the first try. “To get  a hold of” means to reach someone, to be able to – the other person answered the phone. “I got a hold of you,” or, “I’m trying to get a hold of you.” “I’m t rying to call you so that” – when you are there to pick up your phone. The man says t hat he got the woman on the “first try” or on the “first attempt.” The first ti me he tried, he was able to reach her. 

The woman answers the phone and the man says, “Hell o Dana. This is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp. I don’t know if you’ll r emember me but we met last week at the luncheon,” at the Chamber of Commerce L uncheon. The expression, “I don’t know if you’ll remember me but,” is what y ou would use when you’re calling someone and you only met them once, maybe t wice. They may, in fact, not remember who you are so it’s kind of a polite w ay of saying, “Do you remember me?” “I don’t know if you’ll remember me b ut we talked on the telephone last week.” Now, here, they met at a “Cha mber of Commerce” luncheon – and the “Chamber of Commerce” is a priva te group of businesses that – it’s like an organization that businesses in  a specific area, usually, can belong to. So, Los Angeles has a Chamber of Commerc e and they have meetings and they do all sorts of things to help bu sinesses in a particular area. And most American cities have a Chamber of Commerce . “Commerce,” of course, is business and a “chamber” literally is a big room where everybody sits, but here it just means an organization, a business organization. The man asked Dana if she has a few minutes right now. “Do you ha ve a few minutes right now  

for me to tell you a little bit more?” meaning, “Is  this a good time?” Do you have time right now to talk? Do you have a few minutes?”   

The man, Kevin, says, “It won’t take long,” meaning  it won’t take up a lot of your time. I won’t talk to you very long. “It won’t take  long.” The woman says she’s really “swamped” right now. “To be swamped” means t o be very busy, to be extremely busy. “I’m swamped right now.” She asked the man if he has any “literature” he can send her, and, here, “literatur e” means information, printed information, a letter, a brochure, a catalogue that  he can send her. We also use “literature,” of course, to mean “books” and usuall y, good books, fiction books and so forth, but here it just means -- in a busine ss setting, when someone says, “Do you have any literature on it?” they mean, “Do you have anything printed, something you can give me that I can look at?”  

Kevin says, “Sure.” He will send her a “promotional  packet.” A “packet” is just a collection of information, usually more than one th ing in a “packet” (packet). It’s kind of like a package, a packet is. “Promotional” – “to promote something” is like to try to give people information so that they will  buy it. The verb “to promote” means to advertise, to make known, to tell other pe ople. “We’d like to promote ESL Podcast.” We want other people to come and list en to us. The adjective is “promotional packet.” It’s a packet of information,  a set of pieces of information that are about that particular product. Kevin says he thinks he can send her information about what might “best suit” a company.  “To suit (suit) a company” means what would be appropriate from you, what woul d be correct or right for you. We use this verb in a lot of different ways. Y ou can say, for example, about a piece of clothing – a shirt, or a pair of pants. “That doesn’t suit you,” meaning it’s not right for you. It’s not appropriate for yo u.  

The man then asks, “Would it be okay if I called ag ain?” He’s asking permission. Is it okay? “Would it be okay if I call you again?”  And the woman says, “Let’s do this.” And when someone says, “Let’s do this,” they ’re proposing, they’re giving them another option, another possibility, and here,  it’s clear the woman wants to get off the telephone, so she tells the sales perso n what she wants to happen. She says, “Lets’ do this. Why don’t I give you call  if I have any questions.” That expression, “Why don’t I,” is when you are proposin g something to someone and you want them to agree to you – to your idea. “Why don’t you call me tomorrow” means could you please call me tomorrow. The woman then says she’s very busy and she has to “get going,” meaning she has to  leave, she has to go to her meeting. “I have to get going.” The man says, “Oh, I won’t keep you any longer.” When someone “keeps” you, that means that they are preventing you from going. You may hear someone say, “I don’t want to keep you ” – means I don’t want to delay you, to make you stay here. And so he says “I  don’t want to keep you any  

longer.” He will mail the package or the packet in the mail and “we’ll go from there.” The expression, “we’ll go from there,” mean s I’ll send you the package. You look at it and then we’ll see what happens, so it’s a general expression to mean “We will continue on in this conversation or t his relationship,” whatever it is, after you receive, in this case, the package or som e other event happens.  

The woman says, “Sounds good,” meaning, “Okay I agr ee.” “That sounds good” means that’s something I agree with. And the man, K evin, thanks her for her time and she says, “No problem.” And remember, when some body thanks you in English, it’s more common, informally, for people, instead of just say, “You’re welcome,” many people say, “Oh, no problem,” meanin g it did not cause me any problem. It’s okay.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.
