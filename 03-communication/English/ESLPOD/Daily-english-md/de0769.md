This episode is a dialogue between Antonio and Cand ace.  We’re going to be talking about eating strange, different, unusual fo od.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Antonio:  What is that smell?!  It stinks!

Candace:  This is a dish my roommate taught me to m ake.  It’s really good. Want a bite?

Antonio:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  You actuall y eat that?  You can stomach something that smells that foul?

Candace:  Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.  I admit that it’s an acquired taste, but once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not onl y like it, you’ll crave it like I do.

Antonio:  I would never crave something that unappe tizing.  You’ve gone over the edge.  I’ve always known you were weird, but this t akes the cake.

Candace:  You need to open your mind to new culinar y experiences.  You need to wake up your taste buds.  Your palate will thank  you for it.  If you try it, you might like it.

Antonio:  If I try it, I may puke!

Antonio begins by saying, “What is that smell?!  It  stinks!”  “To stink” (stink) means to smell very bad, to have a very unpleasant odor or smell.  Candace says, “This is a dish my roommate taught me to make .”  Your “roommate” is a

person that you usually share an apartment with or a house with.  Candace says that the food – the dish that Antonio smells was so mething her roommate had taught her to cook.  She says, “It’s really good.  Want a bite?”  A “bite” (bite) is a small piece of food, a small bit of food that you g ive someone just to taste something.  So she says, “Want a bite?”

Antonio says, “You’ve got to be kidding me (meaning  you’re joking, right)!  You actually eat that?”  He can’t believe that Candace is eating whatever this food is. He says, “You can stomach something that smells tha t foul?”  “To stomach” (stomach) is to be able to eat something, something  that is very perhaps unpleasant; it smells bad or it tastes bad.  “To st omach it” means to be able to eat it without getting sick.  Antonio asks Candace if she can stomach something that smells that bad – that foul (foul).  “Foul” ha s another meaning in English, as does the word “bite.”  Both of those can be found in our Learning Guide.

Candace says, “Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it .”  This is an old expression. “Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it” means to ask  someone to keep an open mind, not to say no to something just because it’s differ ent or weird.  First, you should try doing it yourself, and then you can decide whet her you want to criticize it.  “To knock (something)” here means to criticize it.  So don’t criticize it – don’t knock it until you’ve yourself actually tried it yourself.  Candace says, “I admit that it’s an acquired taste.”  The expression “an acquired taste ” means something that perhaps you don’t like the first time you try it, b ut eventually – after a while – you learn to like something.  This happens a lot, I thi nk, with food, when you try new food.  Maybe at first you don’t like it, but eventu ally you learn to like it more and more.  Well that’s what Candace is saying about the  food she’s eating.  She says, “once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not only like it, you’ll crave it like I do.”  “To develop a taste for (something)” means to  gradually begin to like it; slowly, after each time you eat it, you like it mor e and more.  You develop a taste for it.  Once you do that, she says, you’ll crave t his food like I do.  “To crave” (crave) means to have a very strong desire for some thing.  We use this especially when talking about food: “I crave a piec e of apple pie.”  I really want a piece of apple pie.  The noun is “craving.”  We say , “I have a craving for (something).”  “I have a craving for apple pie.”

But Antonio doesn’t think he will like this food.  He says, “I would never crave something that unappetizing.”  Something that is “a ppetizing” makes you want to eat it; it looks good, it smells good.  The opposit e would be “unappetizing.” Antonio says that he would never crave something th at unappetizing or so unappetizing.  He says to Candace, “You’ve gone ove r the edge.”  “To go over the edge” (edge) here means to go crazy, or do too much of something, to take an idea to the extreme point.  For example, you may  like to gamble and you

decide you’re going to go Las Vegas – a famous place for gambling in the United States – and you’re going to bet your entire house.   You’re going to say, “I want to bet my house in a poker game.”  Well, that’s going over the edge, that’s going too far; you don’t want to lose your house in a pok er game.  Antonio thinks that Candace has gone over the edge by eating this weird , unusual food.  He says, “I’ve always known you were weird, but this takes the cake.”  The expression “to take the cake” means to be the most unbelievable or  crazy example of something.  You may have a friend that likes to wea r strange clothing, and one day he decides to go work wearing his swimming trun ks, nothing but the clothes he would wear to go swimming.  You might say, “Well , that really takes the cake.” That’s the most bizarre, extreme example of this pe rson’s weird behavior.

Candace says, however, “You (Antonio) need to open your mind to new culinary experiences.”  “To open your mind” means to be will ing to consider or think about all possibilities, all different options without sa ying no right away.  You’re going to think about many different possibilities, that’s to  have or to keep an open mind. Candace says Antonio needs to open his mind – which  is the same as to keep an open mind – to new culinary experiences.  “Culinary ” (culinary) is anything related to cooking food.  Candace says Antonio need s to wake up his taste buds. Your “taste buds” (buds) are small, little things o n your tongue that are used for tasting; it’s how you are able to taste something o n your tongue, through these little dots called “taste buds” in English.  Candac e says that Antonio needs to wake up his taste buds, meaning he needs to do some thing different, as if they were now sleeping.  She says, “Your palate will tha nk you for it.”  Your “palate” (palate) here means your sense of taste; your abili ty to enjoy different tastes, different flavors of food.  Candace says, “Your pal ate will thank you for it,” meaning if you decide to try different foods you wi ll like it, you like the taste.  She says, “If you try it, you might like it.”

Antonio says, “If I try it, I may puke!”  “Puke” (p uke) is an informal word for vomit, to throw up.  When the contents of your stomach com e out through your mouth, that’s to vomit, to throw up.  A little more inform al way of saying that would be “to puke,” and that’s what Antonio says will happen to him if he tries some of this unusual food that Candace likes to eat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
