<h1>G. Tarot scores</h1>

<h3>Time limit: 1s</h3>

<img align="right" src="p11225.png" alt="A hand in the game of
tarot">

<p>Tarot is a card game played in France. It is played with a 78-card
deck, composed with 21 trump cards (named one, two, ..., twenty-one),
a special card (named the fool) and four suits (spades, hearts,
diamonds, clubs). Each suit has fourteen cards: ten pip cards (ace,
two, ..., ten), and four face cards: jack, knight, queen and king.</p>

<p>Three cards have a special status. They are called the oudlers and are
the fool, the 1 of trumps and the 21 of trumps.</p>

<p>The game is composed of a bidding phase, followed by a main phase. The bidding phase consists in choosing one of the players as the "taker". In the main phase, the players play tricks and try to win as many cards as possible. The outcome of a game is determined by the number of points won by the taker, which is the sum of the values of the cards won by the taker. The value that the taker needs to achieve depends on the number of oudlers he has won throughout the game:

<ul>
  <li>3 oudlers: 36 points,</li>
  <li>2 oudlers: 41 points,</li>
  <li>1 oudlers: 51 points,</li>
  <li>no oudlers: 56 points,</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The value of each card is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>kings and oudlers: 4&#189; points,</li>
  <li>queens: 3&#189; points,</li>
  <li>knights: 2&#189; points,</li>
  <li>jacks: 1&#189; points,</li>
  <li>all other cards: &#189; point.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For instance, imagine that, at the end of the game, the taker has
won the following four cards: ace of spades, eight of diamonds, fool
and twenty-one of trumps. Two of these cards are oudlers, so the
number of points that the taker needs to score to win is 41. However
the sum of the points earned is only 10, and the taker has lost, since
the total is 31 points short of the required total.</p>

<p>You have to write a program that, given the list of cards won by
the taker, indicates if the taker has won her bid, and the number of
points she has in excess, or lost and the number of missing
points.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p> The first line of input gives the number of cases, <math>T</math>
 (<math>1 &le; T &le; 100</math>).  <math>T</math> test cases
 follow. Each one contains an <em>even</em> integer <math>M</math>
 (<math>0 &le; M &le; 78</math>), representing the number of cards won
 by the taker. Then <math>M</math> lines follow each with a string
 representing a card (see sample input).  </p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each test case, output the score. The score of the n-th game
starts with the header <tt>Game #n</tt>, on a line of its own,
followed by the result (see sample output for the exact syntax), also
one a line of its own. The scores are separated by blank lines</p>
