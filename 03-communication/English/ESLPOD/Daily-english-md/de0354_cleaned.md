This episode is called “Being Scared.”  It’s a dialogue between Emily and Stephen about going into a house that is supposed to be haunted.  Let’s get started.    [start of dialogue]  Emily:  I’m not going into that house.  It’s supposed to be haunted.  Stephen:  Come on.  Don’t be a coward.  You don’t believe in ghosts, do you?  Emily:  I don’t, but I’m not taking any chances.  Just look at that house!  It’s spooky.  I’m getting goosebumps just looking at it.  Stephen:  You’re only freaking out because you’ve watched too many horror movies.  It’s just a house.  Now, come on!  Emily:  Why are we doing this anyway?  Just because your friends dared you to go in doesn’t mean you have to.  This is stupid!  Stephen:  I took the dare and I told them I’d spend the night in that house.  If you’re a scaredy-cat, you can go home right now.  Emily:  And let you go in there by yourself?  What kind of girlfriend would I be?  I’m scared to death, but I’m not going to chicken out.  Okay, let’s go before I change my mind.  Stephen:  Really?  I didn’t think you’d have the nerve.  You’re braver than I thought.  Don’t worry.  Nothing in there can hurt us.
