[start of dialogue]

Jerrise: Okay, you were right. We need to do someth ing to improve business. Do you think we should take out an ad in the local new spaper?

Russell: We could do that, but I think a better str ategy is to improve our online reviews.

Jerrise: Who looks at websites with unsolicited rev iews? I’m not convinced that’ll help us.

Russell: Lots of people look at reviews when choosi ng which business to patronize. Right now, we only have three stars out of five, and that’s hurting us.

Jerrise: It’s hard to believe that adding a star wi ll really improve our business.

Russell: Believe it. And those mediocre reviews we received last week? We should respond to each one and try to make it right .

Jerrise: Those reviews were written by a few disgru ntled customers. We’re always going to have a few whiners.

Russell: Yes, but now they’re much more vocal. If t hey’re not happy with our service or product, we need to compensate them for their bad experience.

Jerrise: That would put us out of business!

Russell: No, that’s an investment in our business r eputation.

Jerrise: What you’re saying is that we need to brib e people to write good reviews.

Russell: I wouldn’t put it that way, but we should recognize that crowdsourcing is the wave of the future and we need to move with the  times if our business is to survive.

Jerrise: All right. I guess we can try that.

Russell: What are you doing now?

Jerrise: Writing my own review. I’ve always given m yself excellent service!

Our dialogue begins with Jerrise saying to Russell,  “Okay, you were right. We need to do something to improve our business. Do yo u think we should take out an ad in the local newspaper?” An “ad” (ad) is an a dvertisement – a way of promoting or letting people know about your busines s or your products.

Jerrise mentions “taking out an ad in the newspaper .” “To take out an ad” means to place or put an advertisement, in this case, in a newspaper. You can also take out an advertisement in a magazine. A more general term for this is “to place (place) an advertisement.” That’s probably a more u seful expression, because we could use that in talking about placing an adver tisement on a website, for example, or placing an advertisement on the radio.

Russell responds to Jerrise’s question by saying, “ We could do that, but I think a better strategy” – a better approach – “is to impro ve our online reviews.” “Online” refers to on the Internet – on a website, typically . A “review” is when someone posts or puts their opinion about a product or a se rvice either in a newspaper or, more commonly nowadays, on a website.

Jerrise says, “Who looks at websites with unsolicit ed reviews?” “Unsolicited” (unsolicited) is the opposite of “solicited.” “To s olicit” as a verb means to ask for. The prefix “un-” means “not.” So, “unsolicited” is something that you didn’t ask for, something that you didn’t request someone do.

Most reviews that you read online are unsolicited i n the sense that the business doesn’t ask you for a review. Sometimes they do – a  smart business will ask you to put a review of your product or service on a web site so other people can see

how much you like their product or their service – but an unsolicited review is when no one asks you. You just do it because you wa nt to.

Jerrise says, “I’m not convinced that’ll help us.” Russell says, “Lots of people look at reviews when choosing which businesses to patron ize.” “To patronize” (patronize) means to be a customer of a particular business – or at least, that’s what it means in this sentence.

Russell says, “Right now, we only have three stars out of five, and that’s hurting us.” Often when you post or place a review of a, sa y, restaurant, you are asked to give the restaurant or the product a certain num ber of stars. Usually there are five stars, at least in most American websites that  have reviews of this sort. A five-star review would be a review that says, “This  is a wonderful product. It’s the best you could ask for.” If you give a business onl y one star, that means that you didn’t like the product or service very much.

Russell says that his and Jerrise’s business has, a t least on the website they’re talking about, three stars out of five, which is ju st sort of average. Russell, in fact, thinks that it is hurting them. Jerrise says, “It’s  hard to believe that adding a star will really improve our business.” What Jerrise mea ns here is that by improving their rating, their average rating, from, say, thre e stars out of five to four stars out of five, would really help them.

But Russell says in fact it will. He says, “Believe  it,” meaning you should believe what I’m telling you is true. He continues, “And th ose mediocre reviews we received last week? We should respond to each one a nd try to make it right.” “Mediocre” (mediocre) means not very good. It’s not  a word you would use to describe something that’s terrible. It’s sort of in  between good and bad, but more on the bad side.

What Russell is saying is that their business got s ome mediocre reviews last week. He says they should try to “respond to each o ne and try to make it right.” “To make something right” means to fix something – to correct a bad situation, especially when you’re talking about a customer of your business. Jerrise says, “Those reviews were written by a few disgruntled cu stomers.” “To be disgruntled” (disgruntled) means to be unhappy, to be dissatisfi ed, to have a lot of complaints or things you don’t like about something, especiall y a business.

Jerrise says, “We’re always going to have a few whi ners.” “Whiner” (whiner) comes from the verb “to whine” (whine). “To whine” means to complain, to complain loudly, sometimes in an annoying voice. We  often associate whining with children. You know, when your child goes, “But  mom, I want to go to the

store. Please. I want to go to the store” – somethi ng like that. I don’t know. You know, when I was a child, my mother says I was an a ngel, a perfect child. I never whined. Well, that’s what she tells me, anyway. Or was that my brother?

Russell agrees with Jerrise that there will always be whiners. However, he says that the people complaining on the website are “muc h more vocal” now. “To be vocal” (vocal) means to express your opinions loudl y, usually in spoken words – however, in this case it means someone is writing m ore in their review. You can’t literally be vocal if we’re talking about writing, but we use the term when talking about writing to refer to someone who is writing a lot more than they might otherwise.

Russell says, “If the customers are not happy with our service, we need to compensate them for their bad experience.” “To comp ensate” (compensate) someone means to give something to someone – to pay  someone something, either money or something else of value, in return for what that person did, or in this case, to make up for a bad experience.

We can use the verb “to compensate” to mean the sam e as “to pay,” as in, “I’m going to compensate my employees.” I’m going to pay  them money for working for me. But here “compensate” means “to make up for ” – to do something for someone because something bad has happened to them and you are the cause of that bad experience.

Jerrise disagrees. She doesn’t think the business s hould compensate these customers who are complaining. She says, “That woul d put us out of business!” “To put someone out of business” is to make a busin ess close, usually because the business isn’t making enough money.

Russell disagrees. He says, “No, that’s an investme nt in our business reputation.” An “investment” in something is money or resources or energy you put into something in the hopes of getting more in the future back from that particular activity. “Reputation” refers to what ot her people think about you. You can have a good reputation or you can have a bad re putation.

Jerrise says, “What you’re saying is that we need t o bribe people to write good reviews.” “To bribe” (bribe) means to pay someone m oney so that he or she will do something for you, especially something that may  be considered illegal or dishonest. Don’t confuse this with the noun “bride”  (bride), which is a woman who is going to get married. Unless you want to bribe a  woman to be your bride, which is probably not a good idea.

Russell doesn’t consider this bribing. He says, “I wouldn’t put it that way,” meaning I wouldn’t say it that way. He says, “We sh ould recognize that crowdsourcing is the wave of the future and we need  to move with the times if our business is to survive.” “Crowdsourcing” (crowd sourcing) – all one word – means to use the services or opinions of many diffe rent people, usually by using the Internet somehow.

“The wave of the future” refers to the things that are becoming popular and will be common in the future or in the near future. “To move with the times” means to change and adjust your actions or behaviors to do w hat other people are doing. Jerrise says, “All right. I guess we can try that.”

Russell says, “What are you doing now?” Jerrise say s, “Writing my own review. I’ve always given myself excellent service!” Jerris e is going to write a review of her own business, saying how wonderful her business  is – which, of course, is not exactly what the website that carries these rev iews would probably want to see.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
