[start of dialog]

Eric:  Who were you talking to on the phone?

Melissa:  My mother.  I was commiserating with her about Dad’s retirement.

Eric:  Your father retired two months ago.  That wa s a good thing, right?

Melissa:  Well, it’s good that he doesn’t have to w ork anymore, but he’s driving my mother up the wall.  He putters around the house  and gets in her way.  She retired last year, so she’s had a year to establish  her new routine.  He’s still kind of lost.

Eric:  Why doesn’t he take up a hobby?  That would give him something interesting to occupy his time.

Melissa:  Believe me, my mother has tried to intere st him in gardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has  worked.

Eric:  Those sound too sedentary for somebody as ac tive as your father. How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or g olf?

Melissa:  He wouldn’t be interested in those hobbie s.  I think he needs something more challenging, maybe playing chess or doing gene alogy.  Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.

Eric:  Maybe your Dad just needs time to find his f ooting again.  Given time, he’ll figure out what he wants to do with his newfound fr ee time.

Melissa:  Maybe.  But what does my mother do in the  meantime?

Eric:  She can take up a new hobby, too – out of the house!

Eric starts off by saying, “Who were you talking to  on the phone?” Melissa says, “My mother. I was commiserating with her about dad' s retirement.” “To commiserate” (commiserate) means to spend time talk ing with someone about his or her experience of sadness or problems. It's to give someone sympathy, to say, “Oh, yes, I understand. Boy, that's really dif ficult.” You are commiserating with them. Melissa was commiserating with her mothe r about her father's retirement. “Retirement” is the period of time, usu ally when you're older when you stop working full-time and, we hope, relax a little .

Eric says, “Your father retired two months ago. Tha t was a good thing, right?” Melissa says, “Well, it's good that he doesn't have  to work anymore, but he's driving my mother up the wall.” “To drive someone u p the wall” means to make them go crazy, to drive them crazy. Usually, we ref er to people who are very annoying, or who cause you to get angry or upset, w e may say those people are “driving you up the wall.” Melissa's father is driv ing her mother up the wall. Why? She says that her father “putters around” the house  and gets in her way. “To putter (putter) around” means to spend time doing t hings that aren't very important, especially when you're bored and you’re looking for something to do. Maybe you'll go and you'll clean your desk, or you' ll go outside and try to cut your grass a little bit here and there, but not really s eriously, not with any sort of purpose. You're basically wasting time. You're putt ering around.

Well, Melissa's father is puttering around the hous e and getting in the way of his wife. Melissa says that her mother retired last yea r so she's had a year to establish a new routine. “To establish a routine” m eans to get into the habit of doing certain things. When you retire, and you don' t have to go to work every day, you have to develop a new routine, a new set of habits that you will follow when you get up in the morning and through the rest  of the day.

Melissa says that her father is still “kind of” los t, meaning he’s somewhat lost. Eric says, “Why doesn't he take up a hobby?” “To ta ke up” is a two-word phrasal verb which here means to begin doing some activity for the first time. Usually, we use this phrasal verb when we are starting some new  activity for fun. An activity

that you do for fun for enjoyment, for pleasure is often called a “hobby” (hobby). A hobby could be something like golfing. A hobby co uld be collecting stamps, postage stamps. A hobby could be playing cards, pla ying cards with your friends every Tuesday. That might be something that is part  of your hobby. “To take up a hobby” means to start a new hobby.

Eric said that taking up a hobby would give him som ething interesting “to occupy his time.” “To occupy your time” means to keep your self busy, to keep yourself doing something so you don't get bored. Melissa say s, “Believe me,” meaning trust me, “my mother has tried to interest him in g ardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has worked.” These a re three hobbies you could take up. The first is “gardening,” where you grow p lants in a certain area, grow flowers or vegetables or something else. “Woodworki ng” refers to building things out of wood. We might also call it, if it were an o ccupation, “carpentry.” To make things out of wood is “woodworking.” “Scrapbooking”  is creating informal books with photographs and other things to help you remem ber usually a certain time in your life or certain important events in your life.  That's called “scrapbooking” (scrapbooking).

Eric says that these hobbies that Melissa's mother has tried to interest her father in sound too “sedentary” for somebody as active as her father. He is talking about activities being “sedentary” (sedentary). Tha t means to be without a lot of physical activity, not very active just sitting in a chair on a couch. Eric says, “How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or g olf?”

“Bird watching” is a hobby where people go and look  at birds try to identify different kinds of birds that are out in the world.  “Golf” is a game that you play with a small white ball and metal or wooden sticks,  which are called “clubs.” You try to get the ball into a little round hole. Famou s golfers would include people like Tiger Woods. That's the game he plays, golf.

Melissa says, “He wouldn’t be interested in those h obbies. I think he needs something more challenging” – more difficult – “may be playing chess or doing genealogy.” “Chess” (chess) is a game that you play  on a board where you have two players – one player tries to move the chess pi eces around in order to defeat the other player. The board usually has white and b lack squares and each side of the board has these little pieces that you move aro und and try to capture the other person's pieces. That's chess. “Genealogy” (g enealogy) is when you study your ancestors, when you figure out who your grandf ather, your great- grandfather, your great-great-grandfather, your gre at-great-great grandfather, were. You try to figure out who all those people we re.

Melissa says, “Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.” A musical instrument would be something like a guitar  or a piano or a violin. Those are all musical instruments, things that we use to make music. Eric says, “Maybe your dad just needs to find his footing again.” “To  find your footing” (footing) means simply to know what you want, to feel comfort able in a certain situation. Sometimes, it takes a while when people retire to a djust, to change their life, to change their thinking so that they are comfortable in the new situation.

Eric says, “Given time” – if he has enough time – “ he'll figure out” – he'll discover – “what he wants to do with his newfound free time. ” “Newfound” – one word – means recently obtained, something you just got. We  often use that in describing freedom, or free time – my newfound freedom. I just  ended a relationship with my girlfriend. I have newfound freedom! Of course, you  also don't have a girlfriend, but the idea is that it’s something positive. My ne wfound free time, free time that I didn't have just a few days ago or weeks ago and no w I have.

Melissa says, “Maybe, but what does my mother do in  the meantime?” – until that happens. Eric says, “She can take up a new hobby to o – out of the house,” meaning until Melissa's father finds a new hobby, a  new routine, Melissa's mother should take up a new hobby that would requir e her to leave the house so she wasn't in the house with her husband.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a normal speed.
