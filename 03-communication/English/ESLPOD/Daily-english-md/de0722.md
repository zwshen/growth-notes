This episode is a dialogue between Cleo and Victor;  they’re talking about television shows and some common vocabulary we migh t use when we talk about TV shows.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cleo:  The new TV season is starting this week and I can’t wait.  I’ve been watching reruns all summer and I’m ready for the pr emiers of my favorite shows.

Victor:  You watch Madwomen , right?

Cleo:  Yes, it’s my favorite show.

Victor:  Then I’ve got some bad news for you.  It’s  been cancelled.

Cleo:  How is that possible?  The show was on hiatu s last season because of contract negotiations, but I heard that it had been  renewed for another season. The season finale was a cliffhanger!

Victor:  I know, but something must have gone wrong .  They filmed two episodes, which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-seaso n replacement.

Cleo:  This is outrageous!  I’ve been waiting nearl y two years for its return.  Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show t onight, Reviver .

Victor:  Sorry, but it’s been preempted.  The presi dent is giving a televised speech tonight.

Cleo:  Are you kidding me?!

Victor:  Nope, sorry.

Cleo:  The world is conspiring against me.  I’ve ha d enough.  I’m giving up TV watching!

Victor:  You?  That I’ve got to see!

[end of dialogue]

Cleo begins by saying to Victor, “The new TV season  is starting this week and I can’t wait.”  The TV season traditionally has been the time of year where most of the new entertainment television shows are shown.  This, in the U.S., is usually between September until May, so the TV season typic ally starts in September. Everyone is back from vacation, the children are at  school, and people are watching more television.  That’s the idea; they st art the new shows in September, so the TV season would be that period of  time.  A “season” is a period of time; it could be weeks, it could be mont hs.  There are four seasons in the year: we talk about summer, winter, fall, and s pring.  But we can also have a season for some other event or some other activity,  baseball season or football season for example.

Cleo says, “I’ve been watching reruns all summer an d I’m ready for the premiers of my favorite shows.”  A “rerun” (rerun) is a tele vision show that is shown more than once; the same episodes are shown again, somet imes on the same television station or channel.  A rerun could be so mething from a show that is still producing new shows.  During summertime, the big te levision stations usually show episodes of television programs from the previ ous year; they have been shown once, but now they’re showing them again.  So metimes, reruns can go many years after the show is no longer on the air –  that is, are no longer producing new shows.  There are many examples of th is: Friends , M.A.S.H ., Seinfeld .  Those are three television shows that have, we w ould say, “been in syndication.”  They have been showing the reruns on  different television channels for many years.

Cleo is tired of watching reruns; she’s ready for the premiers of her favorite shows.  A “premier” (premier) is the first time tha t something is shown or seen. In this case, it would be the first episode of a te levision show beginning the new TV season.

Victor says, “You watch Madwomen , right?”  Madwomen  is not a real television show; there is a real television show called Mad Me n, but this is a different show. Cleo says, “Yes, it’s my favorite show.”  Victor sa ys, “Then I’ve got some bad

news for you (I have something bad or unfortunate to tell you).  It’s been cancelled.”  “To cancel” (cancel) means to decide n ot to continue doing something that was supposed to continue to be done.   For example, a television show may be cancelled after its first season; maybe  it wasn’t very popular. Sometimes television shows are canceled after only two or three episodes; if no one is watching them the television station – the t elevision, we would call it, “network,” the national company – will cancel a sho w.

Cleo says, “How is that possible?  The show was on hiatus last season because of contract negotiations, but I heard that it had b een renewed for another season.”  “Hiatus” (hiatus) is a break or a pause in something or in a series of things.  When we say a television show is “on hiatu s,” we mean that they are not actually working on it right now.  That’s a word yo u’ll hear in Los Angeles when you talk to people who work in the movie or televis ion industry; here we simply call it “the Industry.”  A television show will be in hiatus; it will not be filming, they will not be actually making the new episodes during  a certain period of time. Cleo says that this show was on hiatus the entire l ast season – last year – because of contract negotiations.  “Contract negoti ations” are discussions between two or more people to determine how much yo u should be paid.  If an actor has contract negotiations, he’s trying to get  more money from the television company – the production company.

Cleo says, “I heard that (her favorite show) had be en renewed for another season.”  If a television show is popular, they wil l continue it for another set of shows – another season, and that’s called “renewing ” the show (renewing).  She says – Cleo – that she thought the show had been re newed.  “The season finale was a cliffhanger!”  A “season finale” of a televis ion show is the final episode of that year.  We talked about the “premier” being the  first episode; the “finale” is the final episode.  If the television show is being can celled, sometimes they’ll have a “series finale,” the last episode they will ever ma ke.  The season finale, according to Cleo, last year was a cliffhanger.  A “cliffhang er” (one word) is a story in a television show or perhaps a movie that has a very exciting ending but it doesn’t end completely; it doesn’t tell you what happens ne xt, and it makes you want to find out what happens next.  We call that a cliffha nger.

Victor says, “I know, but something must have gone wrong (there must have been a problem).  They filmed two episodes (they ma de – they produced two episodes), which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-season replacement.”  An “episode” is one of many shows in a series of shows .  We have different podcast episodes each week, three every week.  Well, televi sion shows have episodes. “They filmed two episodes,” Victor says, “which the y will air.”  “To air” (air) as a verb means to show on television; “to broadcast” on  television, we used to say.

After they show or air those two episodes, Victor s ays, “there will be a mid- season replacement.”  A “replacement” is something that takes the place of another thing.  “Mid-season” would be sometime betw een September and May, before the complete season ends.  A television seas on for a TV show might have 25, maybe 30 episodes, usually a little less.  A mi d-season replacement might happen in November, December, or January, when a sh ow isn’t very popular and so they put on a new show.

Cleo says, “This is outrageous (this is terrible)!  I’ve been waiting two years for Madwomen ’s return.  Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show tonight, Reviver .”  Again, not a real show, though it sounds like S urvivor , which is a real show.  Victor says, “Sorry, but Reviver  been preempted.”  “To preempt” (preempt) means to replace something with something  else, especially something more important.  On television, for examp le, if the president is going to be giving an important speech, sometimes they will preempt shows; they will not show them and replace them with, for example, the p resident’s speech, and that’s what is happening in our dialogue.  “The pre sident is giving a televised speech tonight.”  “Televised” means shown on TV.

Cleo says, “Are you kidding me?!” meaning are you j oking with me.  Victor says, “Nope,” which is an informal way of saying “no” – “ nope” (nope).  If you want to say “yes” the informal phrase would be “yup” (yup),  but “nope” I think is a little more common.  Anyway, Victor says, “Nope, sorry.”  Cleo says, “The world is conspiring against me.”  “To conspire against (some one)” is when you have many people working, trying to harm another person in some way, or trying to make life difficult for you.  Of course, no one is actually conspiring against Cleo. It’s an expression we sometimes use as a joke to say that everything is going wrong, as if someone were trying to hurt you or har m you.

Cleo says, “I’ve had enough.  I’m giving up TV watc hing!”  “To give up” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to stop doing something that you normally like to do. “I’m going to give up smoking.”  I’m going to stop smoking cigarettes.  Actually I don’t smoke, it’s just an example.  “I’m going to g ive up Earl Grey tea lattes at Starbucks.”  No, I’m just kidding.  I’m not going to give up my Earl Grey tea lattes!

Victor says, “You?” meaning you’re going to give up  TV, “That I’ve got to see!” The expression “that I’ve got to see” means that yo u don’t believe the person. You think that what they said or just promised to d o won’t happen, you don’t believe them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
