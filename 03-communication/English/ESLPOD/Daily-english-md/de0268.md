Let's get started.  > Bill:  What are you watching?  Susan:  I’m watching a really interesting TV program.  It’s about how to make a lot of money quickly and easily.  Bill:  Are you watching an infomercial?  Those things are scams!  You should know better than to fall for some get-rich-quick scheme.    Susan:  This isn’t a scam.  This program is about how make money with no capital.  All I have to do is to get other people to sell these products and I’ll get a cut of the profits.  Bill:  That sounds like a pyramid scheme.  Only a few people at the top make money, while all of the other people lose their shirts.    Susan:  It doesn’t seem like a fraud to me.  Sit down and watch for a minute and you’ll see all of the testimonials from people who have used this system and who have struck it rich.  It may really work.  Bill:  There’s a sucker born every minute.  How much do you have to pay to learn the secrets to this system?
