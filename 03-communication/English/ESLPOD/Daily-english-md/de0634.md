This episode is a dialogue about how people look like th eir parents – seems pretty obvious.  But, we’ll be using some phrases and expre ssions related to your family and looking like members of your family.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Khaled:  Hi, what are you looking at?

Susanna:  Your photo albums.  Your roommate let me in  and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.

Khaled:  There are some really incriminating pictures in  there.  You’d better give those back to me.

Susanna:  Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures and  your family portraits. You’re the spitting image of your mother.

Khaled:  That’s not my mother.  That was our neighbor.

Susanna:  Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.  You’re a chip off the old block.

Khaled:  That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s frie nd.  Now, why don’t I take those…

Susanna:  Wait!  These candids of your birthday parties a re so cute!  You were so adorable!

Khaled:  Right.  When I was a kid, I had a face only a  mother could love.

 Susanna:  That’s not true!  You have a great profile.  I’d expect to see your likeness in paintings and on statues.

Khaled:  Okay, enough with the brown-nosing.  What do you really want?

Susanna:  I don’t want anything…okay, just one little th ing.  My cousin is in town. I want to go out with Rick tonight and I thought we co uld double date.  Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.  What do you say?

Khaled:  I knew it had to be something.  Does she look l ike you?

Susanna:  We are like two peas in a pod.

Khaled:  Then, forget it!

Susanna:  Hmph!

Our dialogue opens with Khaled saying, “Hi, what are you looking at?”  Susanna says, “Your photo albums.”  A “photo (or photography) a lbum” (album) is a book you use to keep your photographs in; usually they have plas tic that you put over the photographs to protect them.  Susanna says, “Your ro ommate let me in and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.”  “Your roommate” would be the person that Khaled lives with.  He let S usanna in, meaning he opened the door and said, “Sure, come in,” and probab ly left.  The roommate said that Susanna could make herself comfortable, meanin g could sit down, could relax while she waited for Khaled.

Khaled says, “There are some really incriminating pictures  in there.” “Incriminating,” literally, is when you are made to loo k guilty of something.  If you come out of a room and there is blood on your hands and  you have a gun in your pocket and someone has been killed in the next room, the gun and the blood are incriminating; they show that you did something wrong.  In this case, however, Khaled means that the pictures are embarrassing, that t hey are ones that he does not want other people to see.  He says, “You’d be tter give those back to me,” meaning I want them back now.

Susanna says, “Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures a nd your family portraits.”  “Baby pictures” are, of course, photograp hs of a very young child,

 usually less than one year old.  Many of us have baby picture s; I have a baby picture, that was the first picture my parents took of me  back in 1963.  They took another photograph again in 1973, and there aren’t very many photographs in between those 10 years.  But I have one picture: my baby picture.  Do I look cute?  I won’t tell you!  “Family portraits” are when yo ur whole family gets together and they take a picture of your whole family t ogether.  This we did a couple of times when I was growing up.  Unfortunately, there weren’t cameras big enough to take a picture of I and my 10 brothers a nd sisters!

Anyway, Susanna says to Khaled, “You’re the spitting image  of your mother.” When someone says you’re the “spitting (spitting) image of  (someone)” that means that you look almost exactly like that person.  The ot her day I was at the coffee shop, someone came up to me and said, “You are th ese spitting image of Brad Pitt,” and I said, “No, George Clooney, not Brad  Pitt!”  Actually, I’m the spitting image of Chewbacca from Star Wars !  By the way, the verb “to spit” usually means that you take some liquid from your mouth and you use your mouth to put it onto something else.  That’s to spit.  Why we say “spitting image” I’m not exactly sure.

Khaled responds to Susanna, “That’s not my mother,” mea ning the picture that she’s looking at is not a picture Khaled’s mother.  He says,  “That was our neighbor,” who could have been your mother – you don’ t know, really!  Susanna says, “Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.” “To resemble (someone)” means to look like someone: “My n eighbor resembles his dog.”  Susanna says, “You’re a chip off the old blo ck.”  This is an old expression; “a chip off the old block” means that you are very similar to your parents, either by the way you look or by what you do – b y your actions.  If your father was a good football player, and you’re a good football player, someone might say, “You’re a chip off the old block.”

Khaled says, “That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s fr iend.  Now, why don’t I take those…”  Susanna says, “Wait!  These candids of your bi rthday parties are so cute!”  A “candid” picture or photograph is something that is taken without you, typically, realizing it.  Someone is taking a picture of yo u reading or a picture of you talking and you don’t know that they are taking a pict ure of you, that would be a candid picture.  “Candid” has a number of differe nt meanings, some of which are found in the Learning Guide.  Susanna thinks these pictures of Khaled’s birthday parties when he was younger are “cute, ” meaning they’re nice to look at, attractive, pretty.  We often use this word – this adjective to describe young children or small animals – or the children of sma ll animals, or the animals of small children!  All of these could be described as cut e – except my neighbors’

 dog, of course!  Susanna then says, “You were so adorable! ”  “Adorable” is like “cute,” it means very pretty, very attractive to you.

Khaled says, “Right,” meaning wrong.  He uses the word s arcastically: “Oh, yeah. Right!”  It depends on the way it is said.  Here, Khal ed is saying that’s not true. He says, “I had a face only a mother could love.”  This is an old expression; “to have a face only a mother could love” means that you are really ugly, that you are the opposite of cute and adorable, and that the o nly person who would love you because of the way that you look would be your own mot her, because a mother, we usually think, loves all of her children – reg ardless of how ugly they are!

Susanna says, “That’s not true!  You have a great profile .”  Your “profile” is the way your face looks from the side – with someone looking a t it from the side. “Profile” has several meanings in English, some of which are in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Susanna continues, “I’d expect to  see your likeness in paintings and on statues.”  He’s so beautiful, Susanna is saying of Khaled, that he could be in a painting or on a statue.  She says she w ould expect to see his likeness on a statute.  “Likeness” is a similarity in the way that something appears; it’s what something looks like.  A “statue” is a l arge piece of sculpture made of stone or metal, usually of a famous person or a nimal.  In Minnesota, they makes sculptures out of butter for the Minnesota Sta te Fair.  Bet you didn’t know that; well it’s true!

Khaled says, “Okay, enough with the brown-nosing.”  “To brown-nose (someone)” is to be very nice to someone because you want that person to help you.  We use that term sometimes in school.  “He’s a brow n-noser with the teacher.”  He says nice things to the teacher; he gives the  teacher things so that the teacher will give him a good grade.

Khaled then says, “What do you really want?”  Susanna says,  “I don’t want anything…okay, just one little thing.”  So course, Khaled was right.  She says, “My cousin is in town (meaning my cousin is visiting – is in the city where I live, she’s from somewhere else).  I want to go out with Rick t onight (presumably her boyfriend) and I thought we could double date,” meani ng you have a man and a woman who are dating – romantically involved – and then  another couple who are romantically involved, and the four of you go to di nner or to a movie or whatever.  That’s “double dating.”  She says, “Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.” Notice she says “me” instead of “I,” informally that’s very co mmon.  She says, “Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.  What do you say?” meaning wh at is your opinion, what do you think.  Are you interested, is what  she’s asking.

 Khaled said, “I knew it had to be something.  Does she l ook like you?” meaning does your cousin have a similar physical appearance as you do.   Susanna says, “We are like two peas in a pod.”  “Peas” are small gre en vegetables that come in – or grow rather in something called a “pod” – a “pe apod.”  Kind of like a podcast! Actually nothing like a podcast.  So, “two peas in the p od” means two things that are very similar.  She’s saying that she and her cousin rese mble each other; they look alike.

Khaled, when he learns that the cousin looks just like Su sanna says, “Then, forget it!”  Khaled is insulting Susanna, saying that she  isn’t pretty enough for him to go out with someone who looks like her.  That’s not n ice Khaled!  You shouldn’t say that sort of thing to a woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
