<P>
According to the Automobile Collision Monitor (ACM), most fatal traffic
accidents occur on
two-way streets. In order to reduce the number of fatalities caused by
traffic accidents, the
mayor wants to convert as many streets as possible into one-way streets.
You have been hired
to perform this conversion, so that from each intersection, it is
possible for a motorist to drive
to all the other intersections following some route.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
You will be given a list of streets (all two-way) of the city.
Each street connects two intersections,
and does not go through an intersection. At most four streets
meet at each intersection, and
there is at most one street connecting any pair of intersections.
It is possible for an intersection
to be the end point of only one street. You may assume that it
is possible for a motorist to drive
from each destination to any other destination when every street is
a two-way street.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input consists of a number of cases. The first line of each case
contains two integers <I>n</I> and
<I>m</I>. The number of intersections is <I>n</I> (
<!-- MATH: $2 \leŸ n \leŸ 1000$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img1.gif"
 ALT="$2 \leŸ n \leŸ 1000$">), and the
number of streets is <I>m</I>. The
next <I>m</I> lines contain the intersections incident to each of the <I>m</I>
streets. The intersections are
numbered from 1 to <I>n</I>, and each street is listed once. If the
pair <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img2.gif"
 ALT="$i\ j$">
is present, <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img3.gif"
 ALT="$j\ i$">
will not be
present. End of input is indicated by <I>n</I> = <I>m</I> = 0.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each case, print the case number (starting from 1) followed
by a blank line. Next, print
on separate lines each street as the pair <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img2.gif"
 ALT="$i\ j$">
to indicate that
the street has been assigned the
direction going from intersection <I>i</I> to intersection <I>j</I>. For a
street that cannot be converted into
a one-way street, print both <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img2.gif"
 ALT="$i\ j$">
and <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="610img3.gif"
 ALT="$j\ i$">
on two different lines.
The list of streets can be printed
in any order. Terminate each case with a line containing a
single `<TT>#</TT>' character.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<B>Note:</B> There may be many possible direction assignments satisfying
the requirements. Any such assignment is acceptable.
