This episode is a dialogue between Karla and Chris about some surprising or shocking news. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Karla:  You look like you’ve had a shock.

Chris:  Yeah, that phone call threw me for a loop. My ex-girlfriend is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.

Karla:  Wow, that’s quite a bombshell. Are you goin g to do it?

Chris:  Of course. If the baby is biologically mine , I want to take responsibility for it. I wanted to start a family with my ex: get marr ied and have children – the whole shebang. So if the baby is mine, I’ll provide  child support, no question. I might even fight for custody.

Karla:  Really? That’s astounding. Most guys would be hoping that the baby isn’t theirs. What did your ex-girlfriend say when you to ld her?

Chris:  She thought I would be outraged or somethin g. Instead, she was the one who was left stunned.

Karla:  I’m surprised, too. Not many guys would wan t to have a child without being married.

Chris:  One part of me hopes the baby isn’t mine, o nly because my relationship with my ex-girlfriend is over and I don’t want to r ekindle it. But I’m not getting any younger and another part of me really wants to be a  father.

Karla:  Well, the DNA test will give you proof, one  way or the other. Just cross your fingers...

 Chris:  I would, but I’m not sure which outcome I w ant more!

Our dialogue begins with Karla saying to Chris, “Yo u look like you’ve had a shock (shock).” A “shock” is a surprise – usually a negat ive surprise. A “shock” can also have other meanings in English. Take a look at the Learning Guide for some of those. Chris says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “That phone  call threw me for a loop.” The expression “to throw someone for a loop (loop)”  means to surprise someone, often with negative or confusing information. When my neighbor told me he was buying a new cat, I didn’t realize that he was buyi ng a lion, which of course is a large animal, not the kind of cat you would want to  have at home, if you’d want a cat in the first place.

Chris says the phone call threw him for a loop. He says, “My ex-girlfriend,” meaning my former or past girlfriend, “is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.” Chris says his ex-girlfriend is “p regnant” (pregnant). “To be pregnant” means that – for a woman only – you are g oing to have a baby, that there is a baby growing inside of you – that is to be pregnant. Most women are pregnant for about nine months before the baby is b orn, before it comes out of the woman’s body.

Chris’s ex-girlfriend is pregnant, showing Chris pe rhaps, not to have the best sense of judgment and responsibility. The ex-girlfr iend wants him to take a “paternity test.” A “paternity (paternity) test” co mes from the Latin word pater (pater) – meaning father. A “paternity test” is a t est to see whether you are the father of the baby. Once again, we get a little bit  more than what we need to know about the life of Chris and his ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend wants Chris to take this paternity test to see if he is the father  of the baby that the ex-girlfriend is now pregnant with – okay, kind of like a soap opera  today!

Karla says, “Wow, that’s quite a bombshell.” A “bom bshell” (bombshell) – one word – here means a very important or surprising pi ece of news – something that everyone would go, “Wow, I wasn’t expecting that!” Karla says this news is quite a “bombshell,” meaning it’s a very large bombshell.  It’s a very important one. “Are you going to do it?” Karla asks, meaning are you go ing to take this test? Chris says, “Of course. If the baby is biologically mine,  I want to take responsibility for it.” “Biologically” (biologically) refers to, in th is case, the real father, if you will, the actual father, the father that contributed his half  of the baby’s genetic code – that would be a baby that is biologically mine. You coul d also adopt a baby. Perhaps some woman or some couple is not able to take care of their baby, and so they

give it to another family. And the family “adopts” that baby – we would say that that baby is adopted but not biologically from the new parents.

Chris wants to see if the baby is biologically his – meaning it’s his. And if it is, he wants to take responsibility for it. “I wanted to s tart a family with my ex, get married, and have children, the whole shebang.” Chr is is saying that before he and his ex-girlfriend separated – before they broke  up – he wanted to have a family with her. “To get married and to have childr en, the whole shebang” – the expression “the whole (whole) shebang (shebang)” is  an informal phrase meaning everything – including everything. It’s a l ittle less common now than it was probably 20, 30 years ago, but you’ll still hea r it. “The whole shebang,” meaning everything – you could say this about a lot  of things. It could be for something as unimportant as your hamburger at McDon ald’s. You got to McDonald’s and you order a hamburger, and the perso n says, “Do you want everything on it? Do you want all the ingredients i n it?” and you say, “Yes, give me the whole shebang.” I’m getting kind of hungry t alking about hamburgers. It’s almost lunch time here in Los Angeles as I record t his so, hmm, maybe time to go and get myself a hamburger. Anyway, back to our dialogue.

Chris says, “If the baby is mine, I’ll provide chil d support, no question.” “Child support” is money that one parent – usually the fat her – pays to the other parent – usually the mother – when the two of them are sep arated, divorced, or were never married to begin with. Legally, fathers – bio logical fathers – maybe required in many places to provide child support to  the mother of the baby. It’s one of the unfortunate consequences of our modern s ociety that this has become necessary – to legally require fathers to support t heir children. But that’s where we are.

Chris says, “I might even fight for custody.” “Cust ody” (custody) is a legal right to have the child under the age of eighteen living wit h you. Normally, when a mother and a father get divorced and there are chil dren, it’s typical for the parents to have “joint-custody,” meaning the childr en spend some time with the mother and some time with the father. Sometimes, the woman is given “sole (sole) custody,” meaning basically, the father has very little right to see the children or to have the children come live with him . But it’s also possible for the father to get “sole custody.” So, “custody” is the right to have a child – usually your own child – living with you. And Chris says he  might “fight for custody,” meaning he’s going to try to have the baby live wit h him.

Karla is surprised. She says, “Really? That’s astou nding.” “Astounding” (astounding) – means very surprising, incredible. K arla says, “Most guys would be hoping that the baby isn’t theirs.” Most men wou ld hope the baby wasn’t theirs

so they wouldn’t have to support it. Karla says, “W hat did your ex-girlfriend say when you told her?” Chris says, “She thought I woul d be outraged or something.” “To be outraged” (outraged) means to be extremely a ngry, to be very mad. Chris says, “Instead, she was the one who was left stunne d.”

“To be stunned” (stunned) means to be very surprise d. Notice also the use of the verb “left.” “She was left stunned.” We would use t hat expression when you have told someone something and then you go away or you hang up the phone or you stop talking to them, and they remain there if you will, surprised. They’ve stayed surprised after that news. Karla says, “I’m surpris ed too. Not many guys” – here “guys” means men – “would want to have a child with out being married.” Chris says, “One part of me hopes the baby isn’t mine.” “ One part of me” means I have two different opinions. One opinion or one desire, really, is that the baby is not biologically mine. “Only because,” he says, “my rel ationship with my ex-grilfriend is over and I don’t want to rekindle it.” “To rekin dle” (rekindle) means to kindle again. And to kindle means to start. Usually, we us e that word in describing a fire. For some weird reason, there is a portable el ectronic reader called a “Kindle” sold by amazon.com that has to do with, of course, books. But in any case, “to rekindle” means to restart.

Chris says, “I’ not getting any younger and another  part of me really wants to be a father.” So, he has these two different desires. One is to be a father and therefore he hopes the baby is his, even though he’ s not married to the mother, which causes additional problems. But another part of him says, “I don’t want to be a father.” Of course, if he didn’t want to be a father, he probably should’ve thought about that a little earlier.

Karla says, “Well, the DNA test will give you proof , one way or the other.” A “DNA test” is a genetic test to determine, in this case,  whether Chris is the actual father of the baby. “Proof” (proof) is evidence that somet hing is true. The expression “One way or the other” means whichever result is co rrect. Here it means, more generally, there are only two possibilities, there are only two ways that this could happen, or two results. The two results are either he is the father or he isn’t. One way or the other, the DNA test will give him proof.  Karla says, “Just cross your fingers.” “To cross (cross) your fingers” means to hold one finger over the other like you are making and “X” – the letter “X”  – and  that is to wish for something. You want something to happen. You hope you get a jo b and your friend says, “Well, I’ll keep my fingers crossed,” meaning I wil l hope that you get the job. It’s sort of like good luck. Chris says, “I would,” mean ing I would cross my fingers, “but I’m not sure which outcome I want more.” An “o utcome” (outcome) – one word – is a result. So, Chris is not sure which res ult he wants.

Here’s an idea, Chris: how about the best result for the baby and not for you and your ex-girlfriend?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
