This episode is something about immunizations. What  are immunizations? Well, you’ll have to listen and find out, won’t you? Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jonas: Hi, Jenny. Are you getting your kids ready f or school, too?

Jenny: Yes, as you can see, we’re buying lots of sc hool supplies.

Jonas: Did you get the school letter reminding pare nts to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school? I know  that your youngest is starting school this year.

Jenny: Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getting an exemption. I’m not sure vaccines are safe, and I don’t want to take a chanc e with her health.

Jonas: The immunizations required by the school are  standard – measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other  children have had.

Jenny: But when I looked at the list, there were a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting!

Jonas: The ones you mentioned are standard, too. Do n’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our kids h ad been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.

Jenny: I’ve read somewhere that vaccines might be d angerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their future.

Jonas: That’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.

Jenny: Why’s that?

Jonas: Because your children won’t be getting an ed ucation. The school is barring any children who don’t get immunized from a ttending school.

Jenny: I call that irresponsible!

Jonas: That’s exactly the word that came to my mind .

Jonas begins by saying to Jenny, “Hi, Jenny. Are yo u getting your kids ready for school, too?” I suppose Jonas means here getting yo ur kids prepared to go to school. Schools in the United States usually start their classes in the fall – in late August, early September. Jenny says, “Yes, as you can see, we’re buying a lot of school supplies.” “School supplies” would be things  like pencils, notebooks, erasers, pens – that sort of thing.

Jonas says, “Did you get the school letter remindin g parents to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school?” “Immu nization” (immunization) means giving the body the ability to protect itself  from a certain disease, either because it has already had that disease, or more li kely because it has received what’s called a “vaccine.” A “vaccine” (vaccine) is  a medicine that is put into your body that allows your body to fight a particular di sease. Usually the idea is that the vaccine will prevent you from getting that dise ase.

Another way to look at this is that the vaccine is the medicine that is put in your body to prevent you from getting certain diseases. “Immunization” is what happens to your body because of the vaccine. So it’ s what happens after you get the vaccine. Your body then has an immunity against  a certain disease. However, sometimes people use these two words inter changeably. They talk about getting immunizations. What they really mean is they’re getting vaccines so that their body will have an immunity, an abilit y to protect itself against a certain disease or diseases.

Okay, where were we? Jonah says, “Did you get the s chool letter reminding parents to submit” – to give to the school – “proof ” – or evidence – “of immunization before the first day of school?” Most schools in the United States require that the parents get their children vaccina ted – that is, given these

vaccines – against certain common diseases. Jonas s ays, “I know that your youngest is starting school this year.” He means Je nny’s youngest child.

Jenny says, “Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getti ng an exemption.” An “exemption” (exemption) is permission not to follow  a certain rule or law because of some sort of special circumstance. Jenny says, “ I’m not sure vaccines are safe and I don’t want to take a chance with her health.”  We’ve already explained what vaccines are. There are a small number of parents i n the U.S. in recent years who have been concerned that the vaccines themselve s are somehow not safe, that getting the vaccine might be worse than gettin g the disease.

Now, almost every doctor will tell you that this is n’t true, but some parents don’t listen to the doctors, and so what happens is they try to get their children into the schools without being vaccinated by getting an exem ption. Jonas says, “The immunizations required by the school are standard –  measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other children have had.” When we say something is “standard,” we mean in this case it’s normal. It ’s ordinary. It’s nothing unusual, nothing special.

Jonas then lists the diseases that are typically co vered by the vaccinations that schools require. He begins with “measles” (measles) . “Measles” is a disease that produces a small red spot on the skin. We would cal l it a “rash” (rash). It also tends to give the person who has it a “fever” (feve r). A fever is when your body’s temperature is higher than it should be.

Another disease that children are vaccinated agains t is “mumps” (mumps). Mumps is a disease that causes a, what we would cal l “swelling” – a sudden growth – in the neck area. “Chicken pox” (pox) is a  disease that, like measles, produces red spots on the skin. It’s very common am ong young children. I had chicken pox, I remember, when I was growing up as a  child.

Now, the reason that we give these vaccines to chil dren is most of these diseases are what are called “communicable,” which is to say that you can get them from other people. Of course, we don’t want the children giving other children these diseases. That’s why we have the vac cines. Another disease mentioned by Jonas is “polio” (polio) “Polio” can b e a very serious disease that causes paralysis – that is, the inability to move y our arms and legs and possibly other parts of your body.

Jenny isn’t so sure that she wants to have her daug hter getting these vaccines. She says, “But when I looked at the list, there wer e a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting?” Jenny

mentions three other diseases that children might b e vaccinated against. “Diphtheria” (diphtheria) is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to swallow. It often causes what we would call a “sore  (sore) throat.” If you have a sore throat, it’s difficult for you to swallow. “Di phtheria” often results in a fever as well.

“Hepatitis” (hepatitis) is a disease that can damag e your liver. Your liver is a very important organ or part of your body. The third dis ease Jenny mentions is “rubella” (rubella). “Rubella,” when I was growing up, was called “German measles.” It’s a disease that also produces a red r ash or spot or area on your skin and produces a fever, much like measles does.

Jonas says, “The ones you mentioned are standard, t oo. Don’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our ki ds had been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.” An “outbreak” (outbreak ) is a sudden increase in a disease, or at least in the number of people, I sho uld say, who have the disease. There could be an outbreak of the flu – of influenz a – where many different people are getting the disease.

Jonas mentions another disease, “whopping (whooping ) cough (cough).” “To cough” is to do this [coughs]. “Whooping cough” is a disease that produces very strong coughs with a very loud, high-pitched noise.  “High-pitched” would be [voice changes] something like this. And “low-pitch ed” would be [voice changes] something like this. I’m not sure exactly how whoop ing cough sounds. I’ve never had it or don’t know anyone who has had it.

Interestingly, we use the word “whoop” (whoop) info rmally in American English to mean a couple of different things. It can mean to d efeat or beat someone in a competition. There’s a somewhat vulgar expression t hat people use, “to whoop someone’s ***,” and the word begins with an “a” and  ends with an “s” and it’s only three letters long. You can probably guess what tha t means.

Anyway, back to the story. Jenny says, “I’ve read s omewhere that vaccines might be dangerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their  future.” “To jeopardize” (jeopardize) something or someone means to put some thing or someone in danger, in a dangerous situation. Jenny doesn’t wan t to put her children in danger by getting these vaccines. Jonas says, “That ’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.” “To opt o ut of” something means to decide not to do something, to not participate in s omething that you would normally be expected or even required to do.

Jonas says if Jenny doesn’t get her children vaccin ated, she would be putting them at risk. She would be jeopardizing their futur e, their health. Jenny says, “Why’s that?” Jonas says, “Because your children wo n’t be getting an education. The school is barring any children who don’t get im munized from attending school.” The school is barring children from attend ing school who don’t get immunized.

What does it mean “to bar” (bar) someone from somet hing? It means to prevent someone from being able to do something or from bei ng able to go somewhere. This is the verb “to bar.” It’s not related in mean ing to the noun “bar,” which is a place you go and have an alcoholic drink – what I’l l be doing right after I finish this recording. Well, no. I’m just kidding. It’s on ly 11 o’clock in the morning, a little early for me for going to a bar.

Jenny says, “I call that irresponsible!” The school  is not going to allow children who don’t get these vaccines to study in the school , to attend school. Jenny thinks that’s irresponsible. “Irresponsible” means “not responsible.” It means not doing the things that you should do. Jenny thinks it’s irresponsible of the school to bar children from attending because they haven’t  been vaccinated.

But Jonas thinks the exact opposite. He says, “That ’s exactly the word that came to my mind,” meaning that’s the same word that I th ought of when I thought about what you’re doing, Jenny, by not getting your child ren immunized.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
