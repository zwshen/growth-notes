# Training Salespeople

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 856: Training Salespeople. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 856. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

This episode is, like all of our episodes, one that  has a Learning Guide. You can find that guide at ESLPod.com.  

Today we’re going to talk about training salespeopl e – people who, well, sell things. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Our company brought in a consultant to do sales tra ining for our store.  For some reason, we’d been getting some complaints from cust omers. 

Consultant:  My job in this training is to help you r store improve its customer satisfaction, so that it can attract and retain mor e customers.  When you interact with customers, you represent this store.  It is ve ry important that, from the get- go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positiv e way. 

Employee:  Sometimes, people are really rude.  They  don’t even say “hello” back. 

Consultant:  That may be true, but it’s still your job to make them feel welcomed. Each customer should feel that a salesperson is att entive and trying to meet their needs. 

Employee:  Some of them don’t even know what they w ant.  They wander around and waste our time. 

Consultant:  Part of your job is to help them defin e their needs, offer them options, and lead them to a decision.  I know that you’re not working on commission, but this is a very important part of yo ur job. 

Employee:  You mean I have to hold their hand the w hole time they’re in the store?  Who am I, their mother? 

Consultant:  I can see that we have a lot of work t o do.  Let’s get started. 

[end of dialog] 

Our story begins with an employee of a certain comp any telling us that his company brought in a “consultant to do sales traini ng for our store.” A “consultant” (consultant) is a person that a compan y hires to either complete a specific project or often, to provide help to emplo yees, permanent employees, of a company. The consultant only works, typically, fo r a short amount of time. Maybe a company needs someone to help them with acc ounting or maybe they need someone to help them as, in the case of our st ory, with selling and helping their sales people sell better.  

That’s what this consultant did. She came in to do sales training to help the sales people – the salesmen and saleswomen – sell better.  “For some reason, we’ve been getting some complaints from customers.” “Comp laints” (complaints) are when people say they don’t like what you are doing.  Often, they are saying that things are not as good as they should be. This shir t is too small. It’s too cold in here. This food tastes horrible. Those would all be  complaints in different areas to different kinds of companies. “To complain” is t he verb.  

Well, this company, this store, has been getting co mplaints from customers – people who buy things. The consultant begins by say ing, “My job” – or my task – “is to help your store improve its customer satisfa ction.” “Satisfaction” is a measure of how well you like something. So, “custom er satisfaction” would be how much the people who buy from your store like wh at they’re getting, like the experience of buying in your store and so forth. 

The consultant is doing this so that the store can attract and retain more customers. “To attract” means to get more. “To reta in” (retain) means to keep them. So, in any sort of business where you sell so mething, first you have to get people to buy something from you once, and the idea  is you want to keep them coming back and buying from you again and again. Th at’s to retain a customer.  

The consultant says, “When you interact with custom ers, you represent this store.” “To interact” (interact) is to have some so rt of communication with another person or some other sort of exchange of informatio n. Talking to someone would be an “interaction,” to use the noun. “I am interac ting with a customer.” We use this term as an adjective – “interactive” – to mean  something that you can do on a computer or on an electrical device like a tablet  or a phone, a smartphone, that allows you not just to get information but to give information back to whoever designed that particular program. So, “interact” ha s a couple of different  

meanings including, as I said, one that is now rela ted to an adjective, “interactive,” in dealing with software, computer s oftware. 

Moving on here, the consultant says that “when you interact with customers, you represent this store.” When you “represent” some gr oup or some organization, people see you as someone who is speaking for and a cting on behalf of that organization. So, when you walk into a store and th e person, the salesperson, isn’t very nice to you, you get a bad idea, a bad i mpression about that store. The salesperson represents the store. The store is repr esented by its salespeople.  

The consultant continues, “It is very important tha t from the get-go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positive way.” The ex pression “from the get-go” means from the very beginning, from the very first moment. “I knew that he was going to lose the game from the get-go.” As soon as  he started, I knew he was going to lose. It’s a somewhat informal expression,  perhaps not quite as common as it was a few years ago.  

In any case, the consultant says that “It is very i mportant that from the get-go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positive wa y.” “To be greeted” means to have someone say ‘hello’ to you. “To greet” is to s ay, ‘hello,’ to make another person feel welcome. Many times when you walk into a store in the United States, there’ll be someone working for the store s tanding in the doorway or towards the front of the store, to welcome you into  the store. “Hello, thank you for coming. Can I help you with anything?” That would b e someone greeting you. “To greet” can also just mean to say “hello.” I gre eted my friend when I saw her in the parking lot. I said “hello” to her.  

The employee says, “Sometimes people are really rud e. They don’t even say ‘hello’ back.” So the employee is already sort of d oubting the consultant’s advice. He says, “Sometimes people are really rude. “To be rude (rude)” means not nice, not kind, to be mean, to be impolite. “They don’t e ven say ‘hello’ back,” meaning you say “hello” to them, but they don’t say “hello”  to you. That’s what the word “back” means here – in return, in response to you.  

The consultant says, “That maybe true” – maybe you’ re right – “but it’s still your job to make them feel welcomed”  - that is, make th em feel like you’re happy they are there. “Each customer should feel that a salesp erson is attentive and trying to meet their needs.” “To be attentive” (attentive) me ans to give your full attention or full focus to something, to be paying attention. A waiter in a restaurant who is attentive is always checking back to make sure if y ou need anything, is always making sure you have enough water or enough soda, o r enough whatever it is that you’re drinking – beer, wine, whiskey. You get  the idea.   

 The consultant says that a salesperson is attentive  and tries to meet the customer’s needs. “To meet someone’s needs” is to d o what that person needs or expects. The employee says, “Some of them” – mea ning some of the customers – “don’t even know what they want. They w ander around and waste our time.” “To wander (wander) around” means to wal k around slowly through an area without any clear purpose, without any goal. Y ou’re not quite sure what you’re doing. You’re just kind of walking. You’re w andering or wandering around. The employee is complaining some that some people c ome into the store and they wander around and they don’t really know what they want.  

The consultant says, “Part of your job is to help t hem define their needs.” “To define (define)” can mean to give the meaning of a word. Here, however it means to identify, to describe something, to, we might sa y, “clarify,” to make clear what that person might want, or in this case, what they might need. So the consultant says that “Part of your job is to help them define their needs, offer them options” – choices – “and lead them to a decision. I know th at you’re not working on commission but this is a very important part of you r job.” “To be working on commission” means that you get a percentage of ever ything you sell. In some stores, especially those that sell expensive things , the salesperson will get a small percentage of every sale. This, of course, gi ves them a motivation, a good reason for wanting to do a good job. In other store s, the salesperson doesn’t get any commission, and often, when that happens, the s alesperson doesn’t do a very good job.  

The employee, who’s obviously not a very good sales person, says, “You mean” – do you mean – “I have to hold their hand the whole time they’re in the store?” “To hold someone’s hand” here means to help them and to  guide them every step of the way – giving them advice, giving them encourage ment, telling them how good something looks on them, to be paying attentio n to them the whole time. The employee says, “You mean I have to hold their h and the whole time they’re in the store? Who am I, their mother?” The employee  is making a joke saying, “Well, I’m not their mother. I don’t have to pay at tention to them and hold their hand walking around the store.” When we say “to hol d their hand,” we don’t mean you actually hold their hand with your hand. W e mean to pay attention, to pay close attention to them. The consultant says, “ I can see that we have a lot of work to do.” This expression means that there are a  lot of problems here, as demonstrated by the responses of this employee – th is salesperson. So, they have a lot of work to do, a lot of changes to make.  “Let’s get started.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.
