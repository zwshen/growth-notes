# At a Casino

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 249: At a Casino.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode number 249.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can get the transcript of the dialogue of this episode, as well as our complete Learning Guide.  This episode is called “At a Casino.”  A casino, “casino,” is a place where you go to gamble.  Las Vegas, Nevada, is the most famous place in the United States for casinos.  Let's go!  > Hanna:  Where have you been?  I’ve been trying to find you.  I just won $80 from this slot machine.  It’s not the jackpot, but now I’ve broken even.    Tad:  That’s really great.  Maybe some of your luck will rub off on me.  I’m just about to see what the high rollers are doing.  Do you want to come with me to check out the blackjack tables or roulette?  Hanna:  I’m not that good at those high-stakes games, where people bet hundreds of dollars on a single play!  I’d like to get the comps they get, but I don’t have that kind of money to gamble with.    Tad:  Yeah, I wish I had somebody rich to bankroll me, too.    Hanna:  I’ll just come and watch you play.  You know, I wish I knew how to count cards.  Then, I might try my hand at poker.    Tad:  Don’t even think about counting cards.  If you get caught, you’d get kicked out of this casino in a minute.  Hey, there’s a poker tournament going on over there.  I want to go watch that later.  But first, I want to get my hands on some chips or some dice.  I’m feeling lucky.  Hanna:  Let’s go.
