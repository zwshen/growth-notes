This episode is a dialogue between Eliana and Matt about dating a possessive person. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Eliana: You’re here! I didn’t think you’d be able to come.

Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as  much as the next guy.

Eliana: Yeah, but it’s been weeks since we’ve seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.

Matt: She doesn’t own me. She’s a little possessive , but I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.

Eliana: Doesn’t she get jealous if you so much as l ook at another woman?

Matt: She’s the jealous type, that’s true, but I re assure her all the time that she’s the only one I want. It’s true that she’s critical of other women, too, but what woman isn’t? She’s fine if she knows where I am and  whom I’m with.

Eliana: You mean you have to report in to her on yo ur whereabouts?

Matt: She likes to know what I’m doing. She’s just concerned about me, that’s all.

Eliana: She seems really controlling.

Matt: What did you say?

Eliana: Nothing. I see Xavier and Sophie over there . Ready to get our tickets?

Matt: Hold on one second. I just need to text Helen  an update. If she doesn’t hear from me every half hour, she worries. Isn’t that sw eet?

This episode is all about “dating” (dating). “To da te” means to see someone romantically – to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. T his is done before you get married. Once you get married, we don't talk about dating. We don't talk about anything, really, once you get married . . . no, I' m just kidding. “Dating” is seeing someone you are romantically interested in.

Eliana begins by saying to Matt, “You’re here! I di dn't think you'd be able to come” – I didn't think you'd be able to come to whe rever Eliana is. Matt says, “Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much  as the next guy.” So, now we learn that Matt and Eliana are apparently outsid e of or inside of a movie theater, and that they are friends. You see how muc h we can learn in just a few words.

Matt says he likes seeing a movie as much as the ne xt guy. That expression, “as much as the next guy,” means “just like other peopl e.” It's a phrase we use to emphasize that what you do, or what you like to do,  is normal. It's what everyone else does as well. Eliana says, “Yeah, but it's bee n weeks since we've seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.” Now we learn that Matt is dating a girl by the name of Helen.

Matt says, “She doesn't own me.” When someone says,  “She doesn't own me,” he's probably lying, but he means, “That person doe sn't control me.” My girlfriend doesn't control me. She doesn't tell me what I have  to do. I don't listen to what she says. Again, this is completely imaginary. This  would never actually happen in the real world. But Matt is saying that his girl friend doesn't own him.

He says, “She's a little possessive.” “To be posses sive” (possessive) means to want to have something only for yourself. You don't  want to share it with anyone else. “To be possessive” means to want to have some thing and not have anyone else have it. If you are possessive of another pers on, you may not like that other person talking to friends or family members instead  of you.

That is sometimes a problem. In fact, it's usually a problem if a person is very possessive, what we might describe as “overly posse ssive.” Of course, you have to be possessive at some level – to some extent, a little bit – about a person that

you love. You want them to spend time with you more  than they spend time with other people.

Matt says, “I put my foot down when she gets too cl ingy.” The expression “to put your foot (foot) down” means to be very assertive, to clearly indicate what you are willing to do or not willing to do. You might s ay, for example, “If I see anyone not doing their work, I'm going to put my foot down  and tell you to go home and take all your stuff with you. You’re fired.” “I’m g oing to put my foot down” – I'm going to be very strong and assertive. I’m going to  say, “This is the law, this is the rule, and if you don't follow it, you are out.”

Matt is saying that he's putting his foot down. He' s being strong and assertive with his girlfriend whenever she gets too clingy. T he adjective “clingy” (clingy) comes from the verb “to cling” (cling). “To cling” is to hold on to something tightly. “To be clingy” is to want to be with another person  so much that the other person may get annoyed or bothered; the other person may n ot like you being that close to them or wanting to be close to them all the time .

Eliana says, “Doesn't she get jealous if you so muc h as look at another woman?” “Jealous” (jealous) is when you have negative feeli ngs of suspicion. You think another person is not being faithful to you or loya l to you. If a woman sees her husband talking to another beautiful woman, she mig ht get upset. She might be jealous. She may want the husband to come back and stop talking to the beautiful woman. The wife may think that her husban d is perhaps interested romantically in this other woman, and therefore doe sn't want him talking to her. That might be actually true. So, you know, sometime s being jealous is a good thing.

However, here Eliana says that Matt's girlfriend, H elen, gets jealous if Matt so much as looks at another woman. When we use the exp ression “so much as,” we mean – especially when referring to, usually, refer ring to something that doesn't seem very important – that it’s a very small action  that shouldn't cause the person to get angry. If a mother says to her childr en, “Don't eat this cake. If you so much as take one piece, I'm going to send you to  your rooms without dinner” – you won't get to eat tonight.

Kind of a mean mom, but you understand what she's s aying. She doesn't want the children taking the cake. If they eat so much a s one piece – even if they only eat one piece – she will punish them. She will send  them to their room without their dinner. Probably not a good idea, but it cert ainly does happen.

Matt says, “She’s the jealous type,” meaning she's the kind of person who gets jealous. Matt continues, “I reassure her all the ti me that she's the only one I want.” “To reassure” (reassure) means to say someth ing to someone to make them feel more confident or comfortable about a sit uation that they have doubts about. You’re trying to say to the other person, “D on't worry. Everything 's okay. What I am telling you is true.” Matt tries to reass ure Helen that Helen is the only one that Matt wants.

Matt says, “It's true that she's critical of other women, too, but what woman isn't?” “To be critical” (critical) means to say negative t hings about another person – to find errors, faults, or problems with what another person does or how another person acts or behaves. The verb is “to criticize.”  Matt says his girlfriend is critical of other women, “but what woman isn't?” meaning all  women are critical of other women. I guess that's what he’s saying. I'm not say ing that. Please don't email me and complain. Email Matt.

Matt continues, “She's fine if she knows where I am  and whom I'm with.” The girlfriend doesn't get jealous if she knows where M att is all the time, or at least she doesn't worry as much. Eliana says, “You mean y ou have to report in to her on your whereabouts?” “To report in” means to conta ct someone and tell them what you are doing, usually so that person can moni tor your progress. It's something you would do if you’re an employee with y our boss. You might report in if you are traveling somewhere for your company,  to tell your boss what you were doing. The idea of reporting in has with it the notion that the person you are reporting in to somehow has authority or control ov er you.

“Whereabouts” (whereabouts) is where you are. “Wher eabouts” is all one word. It's where you are located right now. The police of ten use this word in trying to find a person who is missing or who has perhaps com mitted a crime, has broken the law. “We don't know the whereabouts of this per son” – we don't know where this person is. Matt says his girlfriend likes to k now what he's doing. “She's just concerned about me, that's all,” Matt says.

Eliana says, “She seems really controlling.” “To be  controlling” means to want to make all of the decisions for another person, to wa nt to decide what the other person is going to do – to be in charge of another person. That's to be controlling. It's almost always considered a negative thing. Mat t says, “What did you say?” Eliana says, “Nothing.” Matt didn't hear exactly wh at Eliana was saying, or perhaps he didn't like what she was saying.

Sometimes, if you don't like what someone has said,  especially if they are insulting you or saying something critical about yo u or someone you love, you

might pretend as though you didn't hear them: “Excu se me, what did you say?” You’re basically telling the person to repeat what they said because you want to make sure that you heard it correctly, usually beca use it was something you didn't like.

Eliana, however, doesn't repeat what she says. Inst ead, she changes the subject. She decides to stop talking about this iss ue. She says, “I see Xavier and Sophie over there. Ready to get our tickets?” Matt says, “Hold on one second,” meaning wait just a few seconds. “I just need to te xt Helen an update.” “To text” someone means to send them a message, usually with your phone. An “update” (update) is the most recent information about somet hing, the latest news about something.

Matt says if his girlfriend doesn't hear from him –  doesn't receive some sort of message from him – every half hour, every 30 minute s, she worries. “Isn't that sweet?” “Sweet” (sweet) here means kind or caring o r considerate. Matt thinks it’s sweet that his girlfriend wants him to give he r updates every 30 minutes about what he's doing. He thinks it's a nice thing. It sh ows that she loves him, which she probably does. But it sounds as though she migh t be a little possessive.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

We’re never critical of our scriptwriter. That's be cause she's a wonderful scriptwriter and there's nothing to be critical of.  I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
