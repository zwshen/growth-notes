This episode is called “Falling in Love.”  It is a dialog ue between Maya and Jorge about that old story, a boy and a girl.  Let’s get start ed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Maya:  What are those? 

Jorge:  They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.   

Maya:  Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with  Jessica in them?  I think you’ve got a crush on her. 

Jorge:  I’m not 10 years old.  I don’t get crushes.   

Maya:  Then, I think you’re falling head over heels for her. 

Jorge:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve only just met her.   

Maya:  I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced  you at Yannick’s party.  I could see the sparks fly.  I couldn’t miss her blush or your silly grin.  There was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you, that ’s for sure. 

Jorge:  I hardly talked to her at the party.   

Maya:  Yes, but I could see her stealing glances at you al l night.   

Jorge:  That must have been a figment of your imaginati on. 

 Maya:  Oh, really? 

Jorge:  Okay, I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Jessica, b ut I can’t speak for her.    

Maya:  Yes, but I can.   

Jorge:  What?   

Maya:  She asked me about you. 

Jorge:  When? 

Maya:  Yesterday, at lunch. 

Jorge:  What did she say?  What did you  say?   

Maya:  That’s for me to know and for you to find out!

Maya asks Jorge, “What are those?”  Jorge is looking at som e pictures; he says, “They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.”  Appare ntly, he and some friends went skiing.  Maya says, “Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with Jessica in them?”  “To stare” (stare) means to look at  something for a long time, without looking at anything else.  Normally, it’s considered impolite or rude to stare at someone, even if you find that person attra ctive.  Jorge is staring at the picture, however, not at an actual person.  In part icular, he’s staring at a woman by the name of Jessica.   

Maya says, “I think you’ve got a crush on her.”  A “crush” (cr ush) is a feeling of liking someone romantically.  Usually we use this word in t alking about children or teenagers; when they say they like someone, we say they h ave a crush on them – someone they’re interested in romantically to the  extent that children have actual romantic feelings, that is the word we woul d use, a crush.  So, Maya’s using it sort of as a joke here, because Jorge is o bviously not a child. Jorge says, “I’m not 10 years old.  I don’t get crushes.”  The word “crush” actually has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at the  Learning Guide – you know, for some additional explanations.   

Maya says, “Then, I think you’re falling head over heels f or her.”  This expression, “to fall head over heels” (heels), is one to d escribe someone falling in love with another person, to have very strong feelings of love and affection,  

 especially at the very beginning when you first start to li ke someone.  Someone who falls head over heels is someone who falls in love some what quickly.  Your “heels” are the bottom of your feet, so to fall head over heels would mean sort of like falling down because you’re so much in love with this person.  Which can be kind of painful, both the falling down and the love p art! 

Jorge says, “Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve only just met her.”  Maya says, “I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced you at Yannick’s p arty.”  The expression “love at first sight” (sight) means you fall in love with  someone the first time you see them.  You see a beautiful woman on the other side  of the room and you fall in love with her, that’s love at first sight.  That’s wh at happened with me and my wife actually.  It was love at first sight – well, for m e.  She didn’t even notice I was in the room, but from my perspective, it was love at fir st sight!   

Well, Maya introduced Jorge and Jessica at a party recent ly.  Maya says that she could see the sparks fly.  The expression “sparks (sparks) fly” me ans that there was an obvious romantic connection between the two.  A “sp ark,” technically, is what happens, for example, if you were to take a match and strike it against a stone; it might create a spark.  You’ll see a small part icle flying off, usually with a bright light.  That’s a spark.  A spark can also mean, as i n this case, a connection between two people – a romantic connection.   

So, Maya says she could see sparks fly, she could see that they w ere falling in love with each other.  Maya says, “I couldn’t miss her blu sh or your silly grin.” “To miss” means not to notice, not to see.  So when Maya  says, “I couldn’t miss,” she means it was obvious to me that she was blushing and you had a silly grin. “To blush” means that your cheeks change color, usually to  pink or red, either because you’re embarrassed or perhaps because you’re angry.  A woman might blush if you give her a compliment, if she’s embarrassed b y it.  Perhaps she thinks it’s too much; perhaps she knows you’re trying to exp ress your romantic interest.  A “grin” (grin) is a small smile of happine ss, usually without showing your teeth.   

So, Jorge was happy and Jessica was blushing because, perhaps,  of something that Jorge said.  Maya insists that there was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you.  “Chemistry,” in this context, means a r omantic attraction between two people, where each person is interested in the othe r.  He likes her, and she likes him.  Sometimes if you’re watching a movie, and you see that there’s a couple in a movie who are supposed to be in love with ea ch other, but it doesn’t really seem by their acting that they’re in love with ea ch other, we might say they don’t have any chemistry.  There’s no obvious romantic conn ection with their characters – with their acting, in this case.  

 Jorge says, “I hardly talked to her at the party.”  “I har dly” means very little; I didn’t talk to her very much.  Maya says, “Yes, but I could  see her stealing glances at you all night.”  A “glance” (glance) is a quick look at someone.  We use the expression, “to steal a glance,” meaning that you look at someone quickly without them noticing that you are looking at t hem.  This usually indicates that perhaps they’re interested in you.  “To steal,” her e, means to do it without the other person noticing. 

Jorge says, “That must have been a figment of your imagin ation.”  The expression “to be a figment (figment) of your imaginat ion” means that it’s something that you made up, something that you invented,  something you imagined that’s not real – not true.  Maya says, “Oh, r eally?”  Jorge says, “Okay (now he confesses), I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Je ssica, but I can’t speak for her.”  He says, “I won’t deny,” meaning I will tel l you the truth – I won’t say it isn’t true; I am attracted to Jessica.  “Attracted to” mea ns that you like someone, you think you’re interested in them in a romantic way.  Y ou haven’t necessarily fallen in love with them yet, but you’re attracted to  them.  You can be attracted to someone who isn’t your romantic interest, someone you see i n the movie or someone you see walking down the street.  Many times you’l l feel some sort of physical attraction for that person, and if you’re single , you may then go up and talk to that person – probably not, if you’re like me.  But I’m not single so it’s not a concern for me, is it? 

Jorge says that he can’t speak for her, meaning for Jessica.  “To speak for (someone)” means to speak on behalf of another person, to give the other person’s ideas or opinions.  This is often necessary if the p erson isn’t there; you may talk to them and you agree on some things, and then you go to a meeting and you say, “Well, I’m going to speak for Billy,” “I’m g oing to speak for Laura,” these are her ideas – her opinions.  Hopefully, she’s give n you permission to speak for her.  Of course, you don’t want to speak for some one who didn’t give you permission to do so. 

Well, Jorge says he can’t speak for Jessica, meaning he doesn ’t know if Jessica is attracted to him.  Maya says, “Yes, but I can,” meaning I can speak for Jessica, and Jorge, surprised, says, “What?”  Maya says, “Jessica asked me about you.” Jorge asks, “When?”  Maya says, “Yesterday, at lunch.”  Perha ps Jessica works in the same office.  Jorge says, “What did she say?”  He, of  course, is now very interested.  He also asks, “What did you  say (Maya)?”  Maya says, somewhat jokingly, “That’s for me to know and for you to find out !”  This phrase is used when you have some secret information, but you don’t wa nt to share it – you don’t want to give it to another person.  You want to  sort of tease that person.   

 That is, make them uncomfortable by telling them that  you’re not going to tell them the information.  “That’s for me to know and for  you to find out,” meaning I’m not going to tell you, and you’re sort of making no t exactly fun of the other person, but you are exercising a certain control – a certai n power over the situation because you have this secret information. 

So that’s the story of Jorge and Jessica.  Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
