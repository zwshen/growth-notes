Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,129 – Experiencing Virtual Reality.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,129. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This is an episode about experiencing virtual reali ty. What is virtual reality? We’ll find out in this episode. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Tatiana: Why are you wearing those funny goggles? 

Moustafa: I’m trying out a new kind of virtual real ity. 

Tatiana: You mean like flight simulators? 

Moustafa: This is much more sophisticated. This sys tem creates a complete sensory experience. I can see, hear, feel, and near ly taste this 3-D simulation. 

Tatiana: I don’t see how it can do that. 

Moustafa: With the help of these goggles and headph ones, this computer program re-creates what it’s like to actually be in  a particular place, at a particular time. It even allows me to interact with different people and things. 

Tatiana: I can see how that would be useful for gam ing, but . . . 

Moustafa: It’s not only for gaming. It’s useful for  a host of other things, including relaxation. For instance, right now I’m experiencin g what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping. 

Tatiana: If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.  

 Moustafa: Yes, but with virtual reality, I may neve r have to get out of this chair again. Now isn’t that progress?

Tatiana asks Moustafa, “Why are you wearing those f unny goggles?” The word “funny” here means odd, strange, or unusual. We als o use the word “funny” when something makes us laugh, but here it’s used to mea n weird or strange. “Goggles” (goggles) are things that you wear over y our eyes like eyeglasses to protect them. The difference between regular eyegla sses and goggles is that goggles have protection on the side so that your ey es are completely protected or surrounded by the glass (or usually it’s plastic  that goggles are made out of). Sometimes there’s a combination of rubber and plast ic for goggles.  

Moustafa says, “I’m trying out a new kind of virtua l reality.” “To try out” is a two- word phrasal verb that here means to test something , to do something for the first time, especially when you are trying to deter mine whether you like it or not and or whether you want to buy it or not. “To try o ut” can also mean to try to become a member of a team. That use of the phrasal verb is more common in schools. You can “try out” for the basketball team – you can try to become a member of the basketball team. But here, “to try ou t” means to test something.  

“Virtual reality” is a computer-made or computer-ge nerated experience. Usually it involves you wearing a special device that looks li ke goggles that you put on your head, and it seems as though you are in a different  place or experiencing something that is not real. That’s the meaning of t he word “virtual” (virtual) in this phrase or term. Tatiana says, “You mean like flight  simulators?” A “flight (flight) simulator (simulator)” is a machine that is used to  teach people how to fly an airplane. You’re not actually in the airplane, but you’re in a special machine that makes it seem as if you were in an airplane.  

Flight simulators, I guess, are a kind of virtual r eality, but the virtual reality that people talk about nowadays usually involves somethi ng more sophisticated, and often with just something over your eyes, or perhap s something in your ears and over your eyes. Moustafa says, “This is much more s ophisticated.” The word “sophisticated” (sophisticated) means here advanced  – more complex with more technology. He says, “This system creates a complet e sensory experience.”  

The word “sensory” (sensory) relates to the five se nses: taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. Those are called the “five senses” (sens es). Then of course there is the “sixth sense,” which is talking to dead people.  (You have to see the movie to  

understand what I mean by that.) Moustafa continues , “I can see, hear, feel, and nearly taste this 3-D simulation.” Well, I doubt he  can feel anything although it’s possible.  

A “3-D simulation” is “three-dimensional” – “three- dimensional” refers to height, length, and width. Of course, it only seems as if i t were 3-D. The real world is 3- D. But when you watch a movie – even a movie with v irtual reality goggles – it isn’t actually in three dimensions. It just seems a s if it were. A “simulation” is a situation where you’re making something seem as if it were real even though it isn’t. Tatiana is confused. She says, “I don’t see how it can do that.”  

Moustafa replies, “With the help of these goggles a nd headphones, this computer program re-creates what it’s like to actually be in  a particular place, at a particular time.” “Headphones” are things you put over your ea rs in order to hear music or some other sound that has been recorded. The verb “ to recreate” (recreate) means to copy how something happened or how somethi ng was done to give someone a similar experience.  

What Moustafa is saying here is that there is a com puter program that allows you to re-create what it’s like to be in a particular p lace and a particular time. Once again, it’s really like watching a movie that makes  it seem as though you are there in the action – and that’s what a 3-D movie t ries to do. Moustafa continues, “It even allows me to interact with different peopl e and things.” “To interact” means to talk to or to communicate with another per son.  

Tatiana says, “I can see how that would be useful f or gaming, but . . .” “Gaming” (gaming) means playing video games, something that is very popular nowadays among many people, but not me. I grew up in the lat e ’70s, early ’80s, and video games were just getting started at that time and I never really got that interested in them, but I know they are very popular among mil lions of people, just not me. Well, Tatiana thinks this virtual reality machine w ould be useful for gaming, but she doesn’t seem to think it would be useful for an ything else.  

Moustafa disagrees, “It’s not only for gaming,” he says. “It’s useful for a host of other things, including relaxation.” A “host (host)  of” something is a large number of something. Moustafa is saying that virtual-reali ty goggles can be used for many different things, including “relaxation” – the  act of becoming calm. “For instance,” Moustafa says, “right now,” meaning at t his time, “I’m experiencing what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.”  

“To be outdoors” (outdoors) means to be outside, no t in a house or a building. The sun “shines” (shines) from the sky. “To shine” means for a light to be  

produced. The sound that birds make is sometimes de scribed using the verb “to chirp” (chirp). We talk about birds “chirping.” In fact there’s a bird chirping outside of my window right now. So, Moustafa is saying that  he can experience things such as being outside in the sunshine with the bird s chirping. Tatiana says, “If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shini ng and the birds are chirping” – meaning in the real world.  

Moustafa says, “Yes, but with virtual reality I may  never have to get out of this chair again.” He’s saying that he will never have t o get out of his chair to stand up and leave his house. He says, “Now, isn’t that prog ress?” “Progress” (progress) is an improvement over time, often used when we’re talking about technology, although I’m not sure if everything that technology  has brought us has resulted in progress.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
