[start of dialogue]

Ray:  I have a great idea for your next vacation.  You sho uld go on a singles cruise.

Samantha:  I’m not going on a singles cruise.  Everybody will be on the make.

Ray:  That’s the point, isn’t it?  You can take your pi ck of single guys.  What could be better?

Samantha:  I’m not interested in having a fling!

Ray:  You’ll never meet anybody if you don’t get out th ere and mingle.  Look, here’s a 10-day tour through Asia and the tour company w ill even match you with someone before the trip.  You can use the time on the  tour to get better acquainted.

Samantha:  That sounds awful.  What if I don’t like t he person I’m matched with? I’m stuck with him for 10 days, and we’ll both be miserab le.

Ray:  Okay, here’s something you’ll like – a single’s adventu re vacation.  You can enjoy the great outdoors, while you get to know the sing le guys on the tour.  The worst case scenario is that you don’t meet a guy you like.  Y ou’ll still have a great vacation.  What do you have to lose?

 Samantha:  My peace of mind!  Okay, you’re my brother, and you’re trying to look out for me, but leave me alone and stop trying to mar ry me off.  I’m happy being single.  Can’t you get that through your thick skull?

Ray:  Sure, you’re happy.  That’s why you’re always such a ra y of sunshine!

Ray says to Samantha, “I have a great idea for your next va cation.  You should go on a singles cruise.”  Someone who is “single” is someon e who is not married, typically.  A “cruise” is when you go on a very large boat, and usually it travels for three days or seven days.  For example, here in Los Angele s you can go on a cruise from here down to Mexico and back in three or fou r days.  Cruises are popular ways that some people like to take their vacation  – not me, but some people.  “Singles cruises” are cruises were everyone is sing le, or most of the people are single, and the idea is that it will help you find a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

Samantha says, “I’m not going on a singles cruise.  Everybod y will be on the make.”  The expression “to be on the make” (make) means th at you are looking not just for a relationship but specifically for a sexual relationship, not necessarily a permanent one.  Ray has a different opinion of life ; he says, “That’s the point, isn’t it?” meaning that’s the purpose of the single crui se.  “You can take your pick of single guys (meaning men).”  “To take your pick” means that you have many choices.  You can decide what you want, and choose from man y different things; in this case, from many different men.  Ray says, “What coul d be better?” meaning there is no better situation for you than to h ave the choice of all of these single guys.

Samantha says, “I’m not interested in a fling (fling)!”   A “fling,” as a noun, is a romantic relationship but not a serious one, one that  you do not think will last very long.  “Fling” actually has several different meaning s in English; you know where to find those, in the Learning Guide.

Ray says, “You’ll never meet anybody if you don’t get out t here and mingle.”  “To get out there” means to go out where other people ar e; in this case, to go out and try to meet men.  “To mingle” (mingle) means to inter act socially with other people, even if you don’t know them very well, usually at  a party.  Someone invites you to a birthday party and you don’t know most of the people there, you can go and talk to them.  You would mingle, go from o ne person to the next, very informally, and have conversations.  Ray says, “Look, here’s a 10-day tour

 through Asia and the tour company will even match you wit h someone before the trip.”  A “tour” is an organized trip to see different  places, usually with what we would call a “guide,” a leader that explains everything  to you.  This is a 10-day tour through Asia, and the tour company matches you with  someone.  “To match” (match) two people or two things means to put them tog ether.  There are companies on the Internet, for example, where you can tr y to meet someone else, and you can describe the person you want to meet.  T he company then tries to match you, to find someone who fits or who match es that description. “Match” has other meanings as well in English.  Guess wher e you can find those?  That’s right, in the Learning Guide.  I knew yo u knew the answer!

This tour is going to match Samantha with someone befo re the trip.  So they’re going to say you should talk to this man.  Ray says, “You can  use the time on the tour to get better acquainted.”  The expression “to ge t better acquainted” means to become more familiar with another person, to lear n more about someone else. Samantha, however, is not interested; she says, “That soun ds awful (terrible). What if I don’t like the person I’m matched with?”  What if she is matched with someone she doesn’t like?  Then, she says, “I’m stuck with hi m for 10 days, and we’ll both be miserable.”  “To be stuck with (someone o r something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to be forced to have to be with someone, o r to be forced to have to have this situation.  “To be stuck with (someone)” means he re that she would have to be with this person even if she doesn’t want to b e.  Usually it’s a negative thing when someone says “I’m stuck with this,” or “I’m stuck with her.”  It means you’re not very happy.  Samantha says, “then we’ll both b e miserable,” we’ll be terrible, we’ll feel bad.

Ray says, “Okay, here’s something you’ll like,” he’s going to  give her another idea for her vacation.  It’s a single’s adventure vacation .  “Adventure,” in general, means an exciting experience where you do many new things.   Maybe you will climb a mountain or you will hike – that is, walk – a lo ng distance through the forest.  I’m not sure; I have never been on an adventur e vacation.  Ray says, “You can enjoy the great outdoors.”  “The great outdoo rs” is a term that means nature, the world outside of the cities and the towns.  He says, “You can enjoy the great outdoors while you get to know the single gu ys on the tour.”  So you can meet single men on this tour.  He says, “The worst case  scenario is that you don’t meet a guy you like.”  “The worst case scenario” is  the worst thing that can happen, the thing that would be more terrible than anything else.  So Ray is saying that it can’t be that bad, because the worst thi ng that could happen is that she doesn’t meet a man.  Ray says, “You’ll still have a gre at vacation.  What do you have to lose?”  The expression “What do have to lose?” means that you should do something because there are no negative conseque nces or results,

 and there might be something good: “Call the girl you  met today at the party and ask her out on a date.  Ask her to go to coffee with you.   You have nothing to lose.”  If she says no, well, then, you’ll probably never see her again – unless the party was at your office, in which case – hmm – maybe that ’s not a good idea!

Samantha answers the question “What do you have to lose? ” by saying “My peace of mind!”  “Peace (peace) of mind” means tranquil ity, calmness, the feeling of relaxation, of satisfaction.  Samantha says she wouldn’t  be very relaxed on a singles adventure vacation.  She says to Ray, “Okay, you’re m y brother, and you’re trying to look out for me.”  “To look out for ( someone)” is a phrasal verb meaning to make sure the other person is okay.  If you have  a young brother or sister you want to protect them; you want to look out for them.  Samantha says, however, “leave me alone (stop bothering me) and stop t rying to marry me off.” “To marry (someone) off” is another phrasal verb meanin g to try to find a husband or wife for someone, to arrange a marriage for someone.  A father may try to marry off his daughter, who is still living at hom e and doesn’t have a job. Probably won’t be very successful, however!  Or, you may try t o marry off your older brother, who doesn’t do very well with women.

Samantha says, “I’m happy being single.  Can’t you get th at through your thick skull (skull)?”  When you say to someone “to get something t hrough their thick skull,” you’re saying that you are frustrated with the ot her person who doesn’t understand something because they’re too stupid or too slo w.  The “skull” is the large bones in your head that keep your brain in.  When  we say someone has a “thick skull,” we mean they’re not very smart.  So this is an  informal, very rude thing, not a nice thing to say to someone.  “Why can’t yo u get that through your thick skull” means that you are stupid and you don’t underst and what I am saying to you.

Ray says, “Sure, you’re happy (you’re happy being single Sa mantha).  That’s why you’re always such a ray of sunshine!”  “To be a ray (ra y) of sunshine” means to be a very happy person.  But usually we use this exp ression sarcastically, trying to make a joke, and that’s what Ray is doing here.  Samantha is not a very happy person, she just insulted him, so Ray i s making a joke, saying “you’re such a ray of sunshine.”  It really means you are n ot very happy; you’re not very cheerful.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
