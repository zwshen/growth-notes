This episode is called “Getting In-Flight Service.”  We are going to go on an airplane and try to get some “service,” or some help from the people who work on the airplane.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  I pushed the call button to get the attention of the flight attendant.    Flight attendant:  Yes?  What can I do for you?  Hal:  It’s very cold in the cabin.  Is it possible to get a blanket?  Flight attendant:  We’re out of blankets, but here’s a pillow.    Hal:  Okay, thanks.  I was asleep during the meal service.  Could I get a meal?  Flight attendant:  We don’t have any more of the Baked Chicken.  We only have the Bean Salad left.    Hal:  Oh, okay, I’ll take that.  Could I also get a drink?  Flight attendant:  What would you like?  Hal:  What do you have?  Flight attendant:  The complimentary drinks are listed in our in-flight magazine.  Beer, wine, and other cocktails are $4.
