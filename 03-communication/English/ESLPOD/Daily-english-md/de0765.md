This episode is a dialogue about two people who are  going to end their marriage, but they’re not getting a divorce.  Let’s get start ed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Courtney:  Did you hear?  Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage. 

Ray:  What?!  They’ve only been married for two mon ths!  What brought this on? 

Courtney:  I have no idea.  Neither of them is unde rage or bigamists and they married of their own free will, so I don’t know how  they can ask for an annulment.   

Ray:  I’ve heard that you can get an annulment if t here’s some kind of fraud. Maybe they’re asking for the annulment on those gro unds. 

Courtney:  Maybe.  I wish I knew more.  Ooh, could they be related by blood and didn’t know it?  It’s sounding more and more like a  soap opera. 

Ray:  I suppose we shouldn’t speculate.  It’s sad w hen any marriage ends, even if it only lasted two months.  Something must be re ally, really wrong. 

Courtney:  Or else…  

Ray:  Or else, what? 

Courtney:  Or else, Christopher finally figured out  what a witch Kate is.   

Ray:  Oh, somebody’s a little catty today.  Do I de tect some jealousy here? 

Courtney:  Me?  Jealous of Kate?  Forget it!  I’ve known her for years and I just wouldn’t wish her on my worst enemy!

Courtney begins our dialogue by saying, “Did you he ar?  Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage.”  “To annul” (a nnul) means to end some sort of agreement or contract between two people; you’re sa ying that there was some problem with the contract, that something went wron g and that the agreement or contract should never have been made to begin with.   It was, in some ways, flawed; there was a problem with it from the very b eginning.  Well, marriage is a kind of legal contract.  “To annul a marriage” mean s to end a marriage not because you are getting a divorce.  What you are sa ying is that the marriage was never valid, it was never correctly done; there was  some problem that prevented it from being a real, valid, legal marriage.  In th e United States, you may know, when you get married you can get married by someone  from the government or you can get married in a religious ceremony, which also makes you legally married.  So, you can have a religious and public w edding all at one time.   

There are three ways you can end a marriage.  You c an get a divorce, this is the most common way; this says I was married but I no l onger want to be married. You have to get a divorce from the government; a re ligious organization cannot give you a divorce.  You can have a marriage annull ed.  When you have a marriage annulled you’re saying that there was some  problem with the marriage, that it was never really a legal marriage.  You can  also end your marriage by killing your husband or wife.  I believe this is so metimes known as an “Italian divorce,” although I haven’t tried it! 

Kate and Christopher are going to annul their marri age, not get a divorce – and I guess not kill each other!  Ray says, “What?!  They ’ve only been married for two months!”  Imagine two people getting married and th en ending their marriage in only two months.  That would never happen, right?!  Ray says, “What brought this on?”  The expression “What brought this on?” m eans you don’t understand why something has happened.  It’s very unexpected, and you’re asking why. Why did this happen? 

Courtney says, “I have no idea (I don’t know).  Nei ther of them is underage.”  “To be underage” means that you are too young to do som ething.  In the United States, you must be 21 years old to drink alcohol i n a bar.  If you try to drink when you are less than that you are considered unde rage; you’re not old enough. To be underage to get married depends on the state;  in some states it’s 18 without getting permission from your parents.  In s ome states it might be 16, it  

depends on where you live.  Marriage laws are taken  care of or are made by each individual state, so there are 50 different ty pes of laws, although most of them are similar.  Being underage, however, could m ean that the marriage wasn’t legal and therefore you could annul it, you could say it never existed. Courtney says that neither of them is underage or i s, I think she means to say, a bigamist.  A “bigamist” (bigamist) is someone who i s illegally married to more than one person.  So, you have a wife in New York a nd then you have another wife in London or another wife in Los Angeles.  Tha t would be being a bigamist. It’s called “bigamy,” and it’s against the law in t he United States.  Courtney says that Kate and Christopher married of their own free  will.  The expression “of your own free will” (will) means that no one forced you to do it, it was your choice. She says, “I don’t know how they can ask for an ann ulment.”  You can only get an annulment if certain conditions exist, otherwise  you have to get a regular divorce. 

Ray says, “I’ve heard that you can get an annulment  if there’s some kind of fraud.”  “Fraud” (fraud) is when you lie or mislead  other people, usually to get some sort of money from them.  Ray says, “Maybe the y’re asking for an annulment on those grounds.”  “On (some) grounds” m eans for some reason. “Grounds” is a reason, usually a legal reason for s omething.  You say, “I have grounds for divorce,” meaning I have legal reasons why I can divorce you, because you stole my money or you cheated on me, yo u went and had some relationship with another man or another woman.  Th at would be grounds for divorce. 

Courtney says, “Maybe.  I wish I knew more.  Ooh, c ould they be related by blood and didn’t know it?”  “To be related by blood ” means that you are part of the same family.  You’re part of the same family we  would say “through birth,” not marriage.  So for example you have an aunt, your mo ther’s sister has a boy, and you’re a girl, the two of you are then called “firs t cousins.”  Well, you can’t get married because you’re related to each other by blo od.  You can also be related to someone by marriage.  I would call my father’s b rother’s wife my aunt – my uncle’s wife would be my aunt, but she’s my aunt by  marriage, not by blood.  I’m not genetically related to her.  If two people are related by blood, especially if they’re first cousins, they are not allowed to get married. 

Courtney says, “It’s sounding more and more like a soap opera.”  A “soap opera” is a very dramatic television show, usually that is  on every day with the same group of characters.  In many countries, soap opera s only last a couple of months.  In the United States, soap operas can last  years and years; every day you’re seeing these characters over and over again.   Soap operas often have sort of crazy, weird stories, and when someone says , “this is like a soap opera,”  

they mean that things are happening that aren’t nor mal, that seem rather unusual or odd. 

Ray then says, “I suppose we shouldn’t speculate.”  “To speculate” (speculate) means to say what you think might be true even if y ou’re just guessing.  You don’t really know, you’re guessing what might be tr ue.  He says, “It’s sad when any marriage ends, even if it lasted only two month s.  Something must be really, really wrong.”  Courtney then says, “Or else…”  Ray  says, “Or else, what?” Courtney is saying there may be another reason, and  Ray is asking what do you mean.  What reason?  Courtney says, “Or else, Chris topher finally figured out (finally realized) what a witch Kate is.”  A “witch ” (witch), which is pronounced just like another word spelled different: (which) – a “w itch” is a very rude, negative way of describing a woman that you don’t like, usua lly because she’s mean or unpleasant.  Some people use another word – a vulga r word similar to “witch,” sounds like “witch” but starts with a “b” instead o f a “w,” you should never, ever use that word in any circumstances I think, althoug h people do use it.  But a “witch” would be describing a woman who you don’t l ike, who you think is mean. 

Ray says, “Oh, somebody’s a little catty today.”  “ To be catty” (catty) means that you are saying mean things about other people; you are gossiping about them; you are saying things about what they did in a crit ical way.  It’s sometimes used to describe a woman or a girl talking negatively ab out another woman or another girl, often somebody who they don’t like.  Ray says , “Do I detect some jealousy here?”  “To detect” (detect) means to observe somet hing that is otherwise difficult to see.  “I’m detecting some jealousy.”  “Jealousy”  is when you want something that someone else has, that you want what they have  and you’re mad at them because they have it and you don’t.  So in this cas e, Courtney might be jealous of Kate because Kate has something that she wants; she perhaps likes Christopher. 

Courtney says, “Me?  Jealous of Kate?  Forget it!” meaning no way.  It’s an informal way of saying that you are completely in d isagreement with what the other person said, they’re completely wrong.  “Forg et it!  I’ve known Kate for years and I just wouldn’t wish her on my worst enem y!”  “To wish (someone or something) on your worst enemy” is a phrase used wh en you are talking about a person or a thing that you really don’t like, and y ou wouldn’t want anyone else to have to, for example, spend time with that person o r experience this certain thing.  Your “worst enemy” would be the person you hated the most.  So this other person is so bad or this other thing is so te rrible that you wouldn’t even want someone that you hate to have to be with that person or experience that thing.  “I wouldn’t wish her (Kate) on my worst ene my,” I wouldn’t want anyone to be with her because she’s such a terrible person, t hat’s what Courtney is saying.  

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
