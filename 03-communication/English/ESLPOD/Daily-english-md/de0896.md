[start of dialog]

Lourdes: I need help.

Valery: Sure, what’s up?

Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start  of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.

Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. Yo u start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.

Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.

Valery: After that, in your introduction, you shoul d tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the wa y, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to t alk about this topic.

Lourdes: All right.

Valery: Then, in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points, using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.

Lourdes: Okay.

Valery: And finally, in the conclusion, you restate  your main points and make some closing remarks. Simple, right?

Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.

Valery: Shoot.

Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20 th , and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be de athly ill?

Lourdes begins by saying to Valerie, “I need help.”  Valerie says, “Sure, what's up?” What’s going on? What's happening? Lourdes say s, “I'm supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month, a nd I don't know what to do.” A “speech” is a formal presentation, a spoken present ation in front of a group of people. Valerie says, “It's not that hard to plan o ut a speech.” “To plan out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to plan all of the de tails of something, to prepare for it completely, to have a very good idea about e verything you're going to do. Valerie says, “It's not hard” – it's not difficult – “to plan out a speech.” “You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a p ersonal story.” “To get someone's attention” means to get them to listen to  you, to get them to listen to the things you are saying. An “attention getter” wo uld be something at the beginning of your speech that will make everyone st op and listen to you. Sometimes you can tell a story, sometimes you can u se humor. “Humor” (humor) just means a joke, something funny, something that will make people laugh.

Lourdes says, “Okay. I guess I can do that.” She's not too sure. Valerie says, “After that” – after the attention getter – “in you r introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis stat ement.” Your “introduction” is the opening of your speech, the first part of your speech. There's an old rule that when you give a speech, when you give a formal talk , first, you tell people what you're going to tell them. Say, “I’m going to talk about this and this and this.” Then you tell them those things in the same order –  this and this and this – and then at the end, you tell them what you just told t hem, you summarize.

That's what Valerie is suggesting here. Lourdes sho uld tell the audience – the people listening to her – what the speech is going to be about in a “thesis statement.” A “thesis (thesis) statement” is usuall y associated with formal writing, an essay. Valerie is using this idea to help Lourde s understand what she's supposed to do. Your thesis statement in an essay, in a written essay, is a short

statement, usually one sentence, that gives the mai n idea of what you are going to talk about.

Valerie says, “Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you are qualified to talk about this topic.” “A long the way” is an expression we use to mean “as you are doing something.” This e xpression is often used when we are talking about traveling. “I'm going to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and along the way I'm going to stop at F resno to visit my friend.” “Along the way” – as I am traveling from one place to another.

Valerie, when using this expression, is telling Lou rdes that as she is giving her speech, she needs to establish her credibility. “To  establish your credibility” (credibility) means to demonstrate that you are kno wledgeable, that you are qualified, that you know something about this topic  that gives you the authority, gives you the right, if you will, to talk about it.  You know what you're talking about. If you're going to talk about the weather, y ou would want to know your audience will want to know why you are qualified to  talk about the weather. Do you have a degree in the science of studying the we ather, what’s called “meteorology”? That would help.

Valerie says that Lourdes should establish her cred ibility by mentioning why she's qualified to talk about this topic. “To be qu alified” means to have the knowledge or experience to do something. Lourdes sa ys, “Alright,” meaning okay.

Valerie says, “Then in the body of your speech, you  want to state your main points using supporting ideas, giving examples, and  maybe using visuals.” The “body (body)” of your speech is the main section, t he main part, where you tell people with details, the things that you told them you were going to tell them about in your introduction. We call these your “mai n points.” Your main points are your most important points, the most important mess ages that you want to give to your audience about your topic.

Valerie suggests using supporting ideas when talkin g about your main points. “Supporting” means helping. “Supporting ideas” woul d be ideas that help people understand what your main point is. It could be evi dence. It could be proof of what you are saying. You could also give them examp les of what you are talking about to help them understand. “Maybe,” Valerie say s, “you could use visuals.” “Visual” (visual) is something you can see. Visuals  are things that you use, often in a presentation or a speech, that shows people wh at it is you are trying to tell them about. It gives them something to look at. If you're talking about geography,

about where things are, a visual would be a map tha t would show people what you're talking about.

Lourdes says, “Okay.” Valerie then says, “And final ly, in the conclusion, you restate your main points and make some closing rema rks.” Your “conclusion” is at the end of your speech. “At the end of your spee ch,” Valerie says, “you should restate your main points.” “To restate” (restate) m eans to say again. The prefix “re-“ in English, is typically used to mean “again, ” to do something again. A “replay” is to play something one more time. Valeri e says, “You should restate,” or say again, “your main points and make some closi ng remarks.” “Closing remarks” are things you say at the very end of your  presentation – the “close” of your presentation.

Valerie says, “Simple, right?” Lourdes says, “Yeah,  simple. One last question.” Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Shoot” (shoot) is a phrase we use informally to tell the other person to continue asking the question. Usual ly, it's in response to another person who has said that he wants to ask you a ques tion. You may have someone come up to you and say, “Can I ask you a fa vor?” Can I ask you to do something for me? And you say, “Shoot.” You mean, “ Okay, ask me your favor. Tell me what you want me to do.” Lourdes wants to a sk Valerie a question, so Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Go ahead.”

Lourdes says, “What are you doing the morning of Ju ne 20 th , and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?” Lourdes is asking Valerie what he's going to do on a certain d ay – June 20 th  – and how he feels about, what is his opinion, about “standing i n for a coworker.” “To stand in for someone” is to take the place of another person  when that person isn't available, to do what they're supposed to do, espec ially in a work environment. Lourdes is joking, of course. She's asking Valerie if he  would like to give this speech, if he would like to “stand in” for his cowo rker. His coworker is the person he works with, in this case, Lourdes.

Lourdes plans to be “deathly ill” that day. “To be ill” means to be sick. “To be deathly ill” means to be so sick, you could die. On ce again Lourdes is making a joke here. She's hoping that Valerie will agree to do this speech since he seems to know everything about giving speeches.

Being a teacher and former professor, I've given lo ts of speeches. I like giving speeches. I don't think I’m very good at giving spe eches, but I like to give speeches. So, if your organization wants me to give  a speech, send me an email. I might not know what I'm talking about, but I'm ha ppy to give a speech!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed
