This episode is called “Insulting Other People.”  It’s a dialogue between Lourdes and Nick, and we’re going to be using a lot of vocabular y of related to…well…insulting people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lourdes:  Do you see those teenagers over there?  They’r e making trouble again.

Nick:  Those kids are just messing around.  When they get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.

Lourdes:  They’re really getting on my nerves, playing lo ud music and making all that noise.  They’re a disgrace.

Nick:  Get away from that window before they see you.  If  they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along.  What are you doing?  What are you planning to do with that broom?

Lourdes:  I’m going to use it to wave them off.

Nick:  I wouldn’t do that if I were you.  Teenagers can  be unpredictable.  You don’t know if a small slight might set them off.  Insult  them and you’re asking for trouble.

Lourdes:  I don’t care.  I’m doing it anyway.

Nick:  Great!  Now you have their attention.  They’re f lipping us off!

 Lourdes:  Yeah, well, two can play that game.  Take tha t!

Nick:  Are you crazy?!

Lourdes:  No, I’m just giving as good as I get.  Look wh at they’re doing now!

Nick:  They’re mooning us!

Lourdes:  Well, two can play that game, too!

Nick:  What?!  Are you nuts?!  You can’t moon them back.

Lourdes:  Oh, no?  Watch me!

Our dialogue begins with Lourdes saying, “Do you see tho se teenagers over there?  They’re making trouble again.”  They’re causing trouble; they’re causing problems.  Nick says, “Those kids are just messing around.”  “T o mess (mess) around” means to do unimportant things, perhaps to ha ve fun because you have nothing else to do, to be wasting your time doing silly things; this is messing around.  Sometimes people will say, “Stop messing around ,” meaning stop wasting your time or stop making jokes perhaps.  Messing ar ound is usually considered harmless; that is, it isn’t necessarily bothering or hurting anyone, or at least you don’t intend (you don’t try) to do that.  Nick says, “When the teenagers get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.”  “To pipe  (pipe) down” is another two- word phrasal verb meaning to be quiet, to stop making n oise.  This is something I’m sure my father often said to those of us in the backyar d of our house, playing. There were many of us, of course.  He would perhaps say,  “Pipe down out there!”  The word “pipe” has a couple of different me anings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lourdes says that these teenagers are really getting on h er nerves.  “To get on (someone’s) nerves” means to annoy or bother someone, to d o something that will make someone angry or mad.  Lourdes says playing loud music and making all that noise is getting on her nerves.  “They’re a disg race.”  A “disgrace” (disgrace) is something that is very bad, something that i s unacceptable, something that you cannot approve of; we might even use t he word “shameful.” That’s a disgrace.  She’s saying these teenagers are a disg race.  It’s a rather strong word to criticize someone.

 Nick says, “Get away from that window before they see you.”   Lourdes is obviously looking out the window of their house at these  teenagers playing outside.  Nick says, “If they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along.”  “To get a rise out of (someone)” means to ge t an angry reaction from someone, to make someone respond in a certain way.  Usual ly, someone is trying to make you angry; they’re trying to get a rise out  of you – they’re trying to get a response from you.  Nick says if the teenagers see th at they are not bothering us – that they can’t get a rise out of us – t hen they’ll leave.  They’ll move along; go somewhere else.  Nick then says, “What are you doing?  What are you planning to do with that broom?”  A “broom” is what you use to clean the floors.  It has a long, usually wooden handle (a stick), a nd on the bottom are the things that you use to clean the floor; we would say “to  sweep the floor.”

Apparently, Lourdes has a broom in her hand, and Nick is asking what she’s going to do with it.  Lourdes says, “I’m going to use it  to wave them off.”  “To wave (someone) off” means to usually move your hand in the air to show that you want that person to leave (to go away).  She’s goin g to use the broom to get the children to leave (to go somewhere else).

Nick says, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” meaning if  I were in your position I would not do that, it’s not a good idea.  “Teenagers, ” he says, “can be unpredictable.”  They may act in ways that you don’t expect.   “You don’t know if a small slight might set them off.”  A “slight” is a rude or disrespectful criticism, something that you say really to make the other person an gry.  “Slight” has a couple of different meanings however; that’s just one of them.  The rest of them are found in our Learning Guide, where you can get so me more explanations.

So, Nick is telling her that you don’t want to insult or  anger these teenagers because that might set them off.  “To set (someone) off”  is another two-word verb meaning to make someone very angry, to cause someone to do something out of anger.  He says, “Insult them and you’re asking for troubl e.”  “To insult (someone)” is to offend someone; that is, to do or say som ething that makes the other person angry and shows that you don’t have respect for them.  So it’s a very severe, often personal criticism.  The verb is “to in sult,” the noun is “ insult,” a difference in the way that we stress the different sylla bles.  She is going to insult these teenagers, Nick believes, and he says that Lourdes is a sking for trouble. “To ask for trouble” means to do something even though you know it’s going to create problems or make another person angry.  Usually we  try to avoid causing problems.

He’s saying that Lourdes is asking for trouble, she can expect  there to be more problems if she does this.  Lourdes says, “I don’t care.  I’ m doing it anyway.”

 Nick says, “Great!  Now you have their attention,” meaning  now they’re paying attention to you.  “They’re flipping us off!”  “To fli p (someone) off” is, in an American context, to use your middle finger to insult some one.  It’s a very vulgar, very insulting gesture, a way of using your hands to insult someone.  That’s to flip someone off.

Lourdes says, “well, two can play at that game.”  “Two can play at that game” is an expression that we use to show that if someone does som ething mean or bad to you, you’re going to do something mean or bad to th em.  This, of course, is not usually a good idea, but some people when they get angr y, they do that, and they use this expression: “Two can play that game.”  And, of course, what does she do?  Well, she flips the teenagers off.  She says, “T ake that!”  The expression “take that” is a phrase we use to emphasize what  you are doing to another person, especially if you’re hurting them or hi tting them or doing something to beat them in a competition.  “Take that!”   Sometimes it’s used playfully, but I don’t think that’s the meaning here.

Nick says, “Are you crazy?!”  Lourdes says, “No, I’m just giving  as good as I get.” “To give as good as you get” means that you do the same a mount that someone does to you back to them.  Usually it’s a negative behavior;  you’re insulting them or you’re doing something bad to them.  “To give as go od as you get.”  It’s similar to the phrase “two can play that game.”

“Look what they’re doing now,” Lourdes says.  Nick says, “They’ re mooning us!” “To moon (moon) (someone)” is an informal expression tha t means to pull your pants down and bend over and show someone your behind.  For some reason, this became popular in the 1970s, briefly.  I’m not sur e why.  I’m not sure what was in the water at that time!  But, to moon someone is a very insulting, physical action – a gesture, if you will, using your body to insult  them by showing them your behind.  I will not moon you in this podcast – well , if I did, you couldn’t see me anyway!

Lourdes says, “Well, two can play that game, too (also)!”   Nick says, “What?!  Are you nuts?!  You can’t moon them back.”  Lourdes says, “Oh, n o?  Watch me!” “To be nuts” means to be crazy.  Nick says, “Are you nuts (are  you crazy)?!  You cannot moon them back,” do the same thing that they did  to her, and Lourdes says, “Watch me!”  We use the expression “watch me” when you are going to do something that the other person doesn’t believe that you ’re going to do.  They can’t believe you’re going to that.  Somebody says, “I’m g oing to go to the beach with my jacket on,” and the other person says, “Well, rea lly?  That’s crazy.  I don’t believe you,” and the crazy person says, “Watch me,” meanin g I’m going to do it even though you don’t believe me.  So, Lourdes is a lit tle – a little crazy here,

 letting the teenagers take control of her anger.  Per haps she just needs to step away from the window and relax!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
