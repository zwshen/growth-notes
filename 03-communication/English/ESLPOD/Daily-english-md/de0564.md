This episode is called “Working in a Laboratory.”  It’s a dialogue between Tony and Gale using vocabulary you would find in a scientific la boratory.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was working in the lab, as usual, when my colleague br ought his three-year-old son into work. …

Tony:  Hi, Gale.  This is my son, Philippe.  There was a problem with his daycare today, so he’ll be spending the day here with me.  I’ll  teach him all about doing research.

Gale:  I’m not sure this is a good place for a toddler .  Should he be playing with the microscope like that?

Tony:  Oh, he’ll be fine.  I’ll just keep the beakers and test tubes out of his reach and he’ll be all right.

Gale:  Whoa, he almost tipped over that tray of Petri  dishes.  I’m using those for the experiment I’m running, and there are some pretty dangerous chemicals in them.

Tony:  Good thing you saw him before he could do any rea l damage.  I think he just wants to help, right?  You just want to collect som e data for Gale, right?

Gale:  Don’t look now but he’s emptying those solutions into the pockets of your lab coat.

Tony:  Oh, you silly goose!  You’re just trying to make wor k more fun and interesting for us, aren’t you?

[end of dialogue]

The title of this dialogue is “Working in a Laboratory, ” the word is spelled (laboratory); most people pronounce it “ lab-ratory ,” as if there were no “o” in the middle.  You will hear some people say “ laboratory .”  There is also a different pronunciation that you can definitely hear the “o” in: “la-bo-ratory ,” but that’s not a very common one, at least an American English.  A laborat ory is a place where scientists and others do experiments.  Most Americans who ha ve gone through high school, at least many of them, have taken chemistry classe s, and chemistry classes in an American high school are usually held – they usually take place in a laboratory, or least a room that has things you would  find in a laboratory to do experiments with.

This story begins with the woman, Gale, saying that she wa s working in the lab – “lab” is just a short form for a laboratory – as usual, w hen my colleague brought his three-year-old son into work.  Your “colleague” is you r coworker, a person with whom you work, usually at the same business or organiza tion but not always.

Tony, her colleague, says, “Hi, Gale.  This is my son, Phili ppe.  There was a problem with his daycare today, so he’ll be spending the day here with me.” “Daycare”  (daycare – one word) is a type of business that takes care of young children for parents who need to work; they have to put their children somewhere.  This is more common when the woman, especiall y, has to work – the mother, but it could be for either the mother or  the father.  If there are two parents in the family and they are both working, the chi ldren who are too young to go to school, under six years old for example, would need to be placed typically in some sort of daycare, literally care during the day, during the time they are working.

Poor Tony had a problem with his daycare, and so he decid ed instead of staying home with his son, he brought him into work.  Tony says h e’s going to teach his son all about doing research.  “Research” is the process of  learning new information.  In a laboratory it would involve doing experiments, typically.  Gale says, “I’m not sure this is a good place for a toddler.”  Normally, laboratories have

dangerous chemicals or dangerous things for young children.   So Gale says, “I’m not sure (meaning I think) this is a good place for a to ddler.”  Notice although she says, “I’m not sure,” that’s just a polite way of saying thi s is my opinion.  A “toddler” is a one-, two-, or three-year-old child, usu ally a child who is learning to walk; we call them a toddler (toddler).

Gale says, “Should he be playing with the microscope like t hat?”  A “microscope” is a device used to see things that are very, very small, tha t you can’t normally see just with your eyes.  It’s often used in biological rese arch, but also other types of research.  Tony says, “Oh, he’ll be fine.”  He do esn’t think it’s a problem that his young son is playing with this microscope.  He says, “I’ll just keep the beakers and test tubes out of his reach and he’ll be all right.”  A “beaker” (beaker) is a glass cup that has small markings in it for measuring.   It’s used especially in chemistry, when you are pouring or putting liquids into something smaller; the beaker has the liquid material inside of it.  A “test t ube” (two words) is a small glass container; it is round, like a tube.  Usually, it is rounded at one end, so it’s open at one end and it’s closed at the other, and you p our things into it, chemicals for example, when you are doing your experimen ts.  When I was in high school, our chemistry teacher was called “Beaker” by the  students.  Well, we didn’t say that to her, we said it to each other sort of  as a joke.

Tony says that he’s going to keep the beakers and test tub es out of his son’s reach.  “Reach” here would be the area around you that  you can touch by putting out your hand.  “Out of reach” means that it is too far  away from you.  So, if I’m sitting at one end of a table and the newspaper is fo ur feet away, it is out of reach; I cannot reach it, I cannot touch it.  Of course , I could just get up and walk over and get it, but I’m too lazy!

Tony says that he’ll be all right – he’ll be okay, his son.   Gale says, “Whoa, he almost tipped over that tray of Petri dishes.”  “Whoa,” spelled (whoa), is an expression that we use when something is falling, or som ething is about to go wrong, or something is surprising.  Gale says that Philip pe, the young toddler, almost tipped over something.  “To tip over (something) ” or “to tip (something) over” is a phrasal verb that means to knock something over;  to hit something, usually accidentally, and make it fall over.  For example: “I hit the glass of milk accidentally, I tipped it over and all the milk came out  of it.”  Actually, that used to happen to me all the time when I was a child.  My moth er was very careful about giving me too much milk because I would always tip over the  glass – by mistake, of course!  On farms in Minnesota, where there are anim als, the high school students like to tip over cows that are sleeping – complete ly different idea!

Gale says that Philippe almost tipped over a tray – a gro up of, in this case, Petri dishes.  A “Petri dish” is a small, very short, round gl ass or plastic dish that has a top on it that scientists use for certain kinds of research.   Gale says that “I’m using those (those Petri dishes) for an experiment I’m running (I’m doing), and there are some pretty dangerous chemicals in them.”  An “experiment” is a scientific test of something to see whether you are right  about your ideas.  Gale is “running,” conducting or doing, an experiment, and t here are some dangerous chemicals involved.  A “chemical” is a liquid or a gas used i n chemistry for some experimental reason, or for some other reason; chemicals are used in many different things.

Tony says, “Good thing you saw him before he could do any r eal damage,” meaning it is fortunate – it is lucky you saw him and stop ped him from doing any “damage,” any harm.  “I think he just wants to help, r ight?”  He then talks to his son and says, “You just want to collect some data for Gal e, right?”  “To collect” means to gather, to get something, some information, o r physical thing together in one place.  “Collect” has a couple of different mean ings in English, as does the word “tip” that we talked about earlier.  Take a loo k at the Learning Guide for both of these words, and some additional explanations of  them.

Gale is collecting “data” (data), which is information,  facts.  Technically, the word “data” is plural; the singular is “datum,” but most peo ple use “data” nowadays for both singular and plural.  Gale says, “Don’t look now bu t he’s emptying those solutions into the pockets of your lab coat.”  “Don’t lo ok now” means you should look; “don’t look now” means there is something surprising  that is going on – that is happening.  In this case, the young Philippe is emptyin g solutions into the pockets of his father’s lab coat.  “To empty” means to remo ve the contents of something so there is nothing left inside.  When you com e home from your trip, you empty your luggage; you empty your suitcase, you take e verything out of it. A “solution” is a chemical term, usually it’s a liquid tha t is a mixture of two different other liquids.  A “lab coat” is a special piece  of clothing, usually white, that is worn by scientists who are working in a laboratory,  like the one in our dialogue.

Tony says, “Oh, you silly goose!” again talking to his young so n.  The expression “silly goose” is something you would say to a young child wh o has done something funny that has made you laugh.  A “goose” is, you probably know, a kind of animal, it’s a bird; but “silly goose” is a term we use with children to say they’ve done something funny, not something dangerous.  T ony obviously doesn’t understand how dangerous it is for his son in the laboratory.  He says, “You’re just trying to make work more fun and interestin g for us, aren’t you?”  He

thinks that Philippe is funny.  Gale thinks the young Ph ilippe is dangerous, or at least should not be in the laboratory.  This is what hap pens sometimes when you take your children to work.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.
