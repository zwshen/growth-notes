<P>
City transportation planners are developing a light rail transit system to 
carry commuters between the suburbs and the downtown area. Part of their task 
includes scheduling trains on different routes between the outermost stations 
and the metro center hub.
<P>
<P>
Part of the planning process consists of a simple simulation of train travel. 
A simulation consists of a series of scenarios in which two trains, one 
starting at the metro center and one starting at the outermost station of the 
same route, travel toward each other along the route. The transportation 
planners want to find out where and when the two trains meet. You are to write 
a program to determine those results.
<P>
<P>
This model of train travel is necessarily simplified. All scenarios are based 
on the following assumptions.
<OL><LI> All trains spend a fixed amount of time at each station.<LI> All trains accelerate and decelerate at the same constant rate. All trains
   have the same maximum possible velocity.<LI> When a train leaves a station, it accelerates (at a constant rate) until
   it reaches its maximum velocity. It remains at that maximum velocity until 
   it begins to decelerate (at the same constant rate) as it approaches the 
   next station. Trains leave stations with an initial velocity of zero (0.0) 
   and they arrive at stations with terminal velocity zero. Adjacent stations 
   on each route are far enough apart to allow a train to accelerate to its 
   maximum velocity before beginning to decelerate.<LI> Both trains in each scenario make their initial departure at the same time.<LI> There are at most 31 stations along any route.
   <LI>The meeting time of both trains will never be at the departure of one of the trains from a station.

All input values are real numbers. Data for each scenario are in the following 
format.

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
For each scenario, output consists of the following labeled data.
<P>
<OL><LI> The number of the scenario (numbered consecutively, starting with
   <TT>Scenario #1</TT>).<LI> The time when the two trains meet in terms of minutes from starting
   time. All times must be displayed to one decimal place. Also, if the 
   trains meet in a station, output the station number where they meet.<LI> The distance in miles between the metro center hub and the place where
   the two trains meet. Distances must be displayed to three decimal places.
</OL>
Print a blank line between consecutive test cases.
