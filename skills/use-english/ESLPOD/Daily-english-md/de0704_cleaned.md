This episode is called “Reselling Products (reselli ng things) For Profit.”  It’s a dialogue between Jessie and Masa about people who b uy things and then sell them to other people for a higher price.  Let’s get  started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Jessie:  Where are you going? 

Masa:  I’m going to stand in line to get one of the  first iDopes.  They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m. 

Jessie:  Why don’t you just wait a couple of days w hen there’ll be no line? 

Masa:  I’m sure they’re going to sell out, and plus , I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it. 

Jessie:  You’re going to resell it?  Oh, you mean l ike scalping tickets. 

Masa:  You got it.  I can put a markup on it and ma ke a nice little profit.   

Jessie:  You mean you’re going to jack up the price .   

Masa:  I’m not gouging anybody.  I’m just putting a  little premium on a product that’s in demand. 

Jessie:  But what if they don’t sell out?  Won’t yo u be stuck with an extra iDope?   

Masa:  I won’t have any problems unloading it.  Tru st me, this is a simple case of supply and demand.  I’ve got the supply and there’s  a big demand.  Hey, where are you going? 

Jessie:  I’m going with you.  You’re not the only o ne in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough. 

Masa:  I didn’t say you could go with me. 

Jessie:  Why can’t I?   

Masa:  Because then I’d be helping you to junk up t he market.  And that would be shooting myself in the foot. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Jessie saying to Masa, “Wh ere are you going?”  Masa says, “I’m going to stand in line to get one of the  first iDopes.”  “To stand in line” means to stand with many other people, one in front  of the other, waiting to do something, waiting to get into some place.  You may  stand in line at the grocery store, waiting for the person in front of you to fi nish.  Masa is standing in line to buy one of the first iDopes.  This, of course, is n ot a real electronic product like an iPhone or an iPad.  A “dope” is, when it’s a per son, a stupid person.  You say to someone, “Boy, he’s a real dope,” you mean that person is really stupid.  It’s an insulting term, obviously.  “Dope” as a noun wou ld be a drug, like cocaine or heroin, something that you would take to get high –  to get intoxicated. 

So, Masa is going to buy this electronic piece of e quipment called an iDope.  He says, “They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.”  “To  go on sale” means they become available for people to buy them.  That expr ession, “on sale,” is ambiguous – it can have two meanings.  One is that the store is selling it at a discount, at a lower price than normal.  The other is simply that they’re selling it. Especially when we talk about new products – new th ings, we may talk about “go on sale” to indicate the day or the time when they are available to be purchased, when you can buy them. 

Jessie says to Masa, “Why don’t you just wait a cou ple of days when there’ll be no line?”  In other words, if you wait a few days y ou can go and by one without having to wait in line.  Masa says, “I’m sure they’ re going to sell out.”  “To sell out” here means for a store to sell all of the prod uct – all of the particular product that it has.  So, if the store is selling coffee, a nd everyone comes in and buys the coffee, and now there’s no more coffee to buy, we w ould say “the coffee is sold  

out,” or “the store has sold out of coffee.”  Masa is sure that the iDopes are going to sell out; they’re going to go quickly.  “And plu s,” he says (in addition), “I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it.”  I s hould mention that “sell out” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Le arning Guide for some additional explanations.  “To resell” means to buy something from a store, especially something that everyone wants to get and  is difficult to buy, and sell it to someone else at a higher price.  This is somethi ng that happens online – on the Internet all the time.   

Masa wants to resell the iDope.  Jessie says, “You’ re going to resell it?  Oh, you mean like scalping tickets.”  “To scalp (scalp) tic kets” means to buy tickets for a concert or a sporting event – a game – at the regul ar price and then sell it to someone else at a higher price.  In some states in the United States scalping is illegal, not in California.  So “scalping” is consi dered by some people to be unethical, but most of us understand that when you have something that’s valuable you can usually sell it for a higher price . 

Masa says, “You got it,” meaning that’s right, exac tly.  “I can put a markup on it and make a nice little profit.”  A “markup” (one wo rd) is an increase in the price when you sell it to someone else, it’s how much you  are raising or increasing the price.  If you buy something for 5 dollars and you sell it to someone else for 10 dollars, there was a 5-dollar markup.  So, Masa say s he can make a nice, or a good, profit.  “Nice little” doesn’t necessarily me ans small; it means a pretty good profit.  A “profit” is, of course, the amount of mo ney you make between selling and buying.  You don’t always make a profit; someti mes you lose money.  A profit is when you get more money than you paid for  the item or the materials. 

Jessie says, “You mean you’re going to jack up the price.”  “To jack up the price” means to increase the price of something, to make s omething more expensive. However, it’s normally used as a way of criticizing ; it’s a negative way of expressing the idea.  If you say, “Oh, the store ja cked up their prices,” or “The gas stations jacked up their prices after the price  of oil went up,” you’re really saying that they are taking advantage of you in som e way.  So, it’s a negative way to express the idea.  And, you notice that Masa  responds by saying, “I’m not gouging anybody.”  “To gouge” (gouge) here means to  hurt someone by charging a very high price.  So you buy something for a doll ar and you sell it to someone else for 50 dollars, some people would say you are gouging them, you are charging them way too much money.  Masa says he’s n ot doing that; he says, “I’m just putting a little premium on a product tha t’s in demand.”  “Premium” here means a little extra, an additional amount of somet hing.  “Premium” has other uses in English, those can be found in our Learning  Guide, of course.  The product, the iDope, is in demand.  “To be in demand ” means people want it, it’s  

desirable.  Masa is defending himself against this criticism that he is gouging or jacking up prices. 

Jessie says, “But what if they don’t sell out?”  Th at is, what if there are lots of iDopes.  She says, “Won’t you be stuck with an extr a iDope?”  “To be stuck with (something)” means to have something that is not de sirable, but that you cannot get rid of, you can’t get someone else to take from  you.  Masa says, “I won’t have any problems unloading it.”  “To unload” (unload) m eans here to sell something, to get rid of something.  To be able to sell someth ing to other people who want to buy it, that’s “unloading it” when we’re talking ab out selling things.  “Unload” can also mean to take furniture from a truck or a car a nd put it down on the ground or into your house, that can be “unloading” as well.  The opposite would be “loading,” putting things on the truck or in a car.   But here, it means selling.  Masa says, “Trust me, this is a simple case of supply an d demand.”  A “simple” case means it’s not complicated; this is just a case or an example of supply and demand.  “Supply and demand” refer to how much peop le want something, their demand, and how much or how available is the supply  of that something – how much is available.  “Supply and demand” is part of basic economic theory; it tries to explain why you have prices the way you do, espe cially in a free-market economy.  But we won’t go into all of that; you’ll have to take a course in economics if you want to understand that.  Masa say s, “I’ve got the supply (meaning I have the supply; I have the products) an d there’s a big demand,” there are lots of people who want to buy them.   

Masa then says, “Hey, where are you going?”  Jessie  says, “I’m going with you. You’re not the only one in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough.” “Dough” (dough) is an informal term for money.  So,  Jessie is going to buy an iDope and resell it also, even though she was just criticizing Masa for doing the same thing. 

Masa says, “I didn’t say you could go with me.”  Je ssie says, “Why can’t I?” Masa says, “Because then I’d be helping you to junk  up the market.”  The expression “to junk (junk) up the market” relates t o the idea that if there are too many people selling something – that is, if the sup ply increases, price will go down; people won’t pay a high price if they can get  it for less somewhere else. So, “to junk up the market” means, again, to increa se the supply of something so that the price of that something goes down.  Masa s ays, “that would be shooting myself in the foot.”  This is an expression, “to sh oot yourself in the foot,” meaning to hurt yourself, to do something that will be bad for you.  So if you want to meet girls and you decide never to wash your hair and to  eat a lot of garlic, well, you’re shooting yourself in the foot.  Not a lot of girls are going to want to talk to you perhaps if you have dirty hair.  That’s why I don’t  have any hair, you see.  I don’t  

have to worry about that problem.  Oh, and I’m marr ied, too, so that really means it’s not a problem for me! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
