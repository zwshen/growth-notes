This episode is a dialogue about reading other peop le’s opinions on a website about something you may want to buy or may want to try.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marisa:  When we go to our favorite vacation spot in two months, let’s stay at a different hotel.

Oscar:  I like the hotel we always stay at.  It’s in a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it.

Marisa:  That’s just it.  It’s tried and true, but there’s no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.

Oscar:  I don’t need novelty.

Marisa:  Let’s just consider some of these other ho tels I’ve been reading about. They are very highly ranked and their ratings are very good.

Oscar:  You’re putting strangers’ reviews above our  own experience?

Marisa:  Of course not, but just look at this hotel .  It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.

Oscar:  Let me see that.  It also has some cons, su ch as being noisy and pricy.

Marisa:  Okay, maybe that isn’t the best example.  I didn’t notice that they got dinged on those things, but let’s look at a few oth ers.

Oscar:  I’ll keep an open mind, but I’m dubious abo ut online reviews.  I take everything I read with a grain of salt.  The only p eople who post reviews are those who love it or hate it.

Marisa:  I’ll just find a hotel that everyone loves .

Oscar:  And that doesn’t break the bank?

Marisa:  Right.

Marisa begins our dialogue by saying to Oscar, “Whe n we go to our favorite vacation spot in two months, let’s stay at a differ ent hotel.”  A “spot” is a place or a location.  Marisa talks about their favorite vaca tion spot, the place they like to go.  It could be Hawaii, it could be New York City,  it could be Disneyland.  “Spot” has a number of different meanings in English, howe ver; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Oscar doesn’t want to stay at a different hotel.  H e says, “I like the hotel we always stay at,” that is, we always go to and sleep  at.  He says the hotel is in a convenient location.  “Convenient” means easy to ge t to, very comfortable, doesn’t cause any problems.  “It’s in a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it,” we already know it.

Marisa says, “That’s just it.”  That expression, “t hat’s just it,” means that’s exactly what the problem is.  “It’s tried and true,” she sa ys, “but there’s no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.”  “It’s tried and true” is an expression meaning it’s something that we’ve used s everal times and it has always been or usually is successful.  It’s been te sted and proven – it’s tried and true.  “But,” Marisa says, “there’s no novelty.”  “ Novelty” is something that is new, something that you have not done or seen or experie nced before.  Marisa says that there is no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place “year after year,” meaning every year.

Oscar says, “I don’t need novelty.”  I don’t need a  new experience.  Marisa says, “Let’s just consider some of these other hotels I’v e been reading about.  They are very highly ranked and their ratings are very good. ”  “To rank (rank) (something)” means to put things in order based on, usually, how  good they are.  So in a class, for example, a teacher may decide, well, she ’s the best student, he’s the second-best, she’s the third-best, he’s the fourth- best, and so forth.  The teacher is ranking the students: you’re first, you’re secon d, you’re third, you’re fourth.  I

was usually like 35 th  out of 36 students, that was usually my rank!  “Ra tings” are values that you give something based on how good it  is.  It could be a number 1 to 10, where 10 is the best and 1 is the worst.  “I  would rate” – notice we can use it as a verb also – “I would rate this movie a 5 ou t of 10,” meaning it’s not great, but it’s not terrible either, it’s somewhere in bet ween.  Or, “I would give this restaurant three stars.”  A star usually is used in  school by a teacher to indicate that you did a good job.  We use it in rating thing s like restaurants; the more stars it gets the better it is.  We do this for movies, t oo.  Well, that’s what “ratings” are; “ratings” are numbers – usually numbers that you gi ve something to indicate how good it is.  “Rankings” is when you take a group of  things and you put them in a certain order: first, second, or third.

Oscar says, “You’re putting strangers’ reviews abov e our own experience?”  A “review” is a written opinion – usually a written o pinion about how good or how bad something is.  And on the websites nowadays, on  many of them that sell things, you can read reviews, what people think abo ut the things that they bought.  Sometimes they like them, sometimes they d on’t.  And when they give a review, usually they give a rating; they say how ma ny points they would give it from 1 to 5, how many stars they would give this pa rticular product.  Oscar is asking Marisa if she’s putting the opinions – the r eviews of other people above their own experience, meaning she’s saying that oth er people’s experience is somehow more important in making the decision than their own experience.

Marisa says, “Of course not, but just look at this hotel.  It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.”  To receive thr ee stars, as I mentioned earlier, for a hotel or a restaurant is a way of saying how good  it is.  It could just be three as a number; we use stars for reasons I explained, bec ause that’s what has traditionally been used to indicate how good someth ing is.  So if the ratings go from one being the worst to four being the best, th en getting three out of four stars is pretty good.  Marisa says the hotel has a lot of pros.  “Pros” means positive things, good things, advantages.  “Pro” ha s a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some of those.  Often when we’re talking about the good and bad qualities  of something we’ll use the expression “pros and cons” (cons).  A “con” in this  case means a disadvantage, a negative or an undesirable thing.  So “pros” are go od, “cons” are bad.

Oscar says, “Let me see that.”  He’s apparently loo king at a piece of paper that has the reviews of the hotel on it.  He says the ho tel has some cons, such as being noisy and pricy.  “Pricy” (pricy) means expen sive, it costs a lot of money, it’s not cheap.  Marisa says, “Okay, maybe that isn ’t the best example.  I didn’t notice that they (the hotel) got dinged on those th ings, but let’s look at a few others.”  “To get dinged” (dinged) – the verb is “t o ding” (ding) – means to get a

lower rating on something, a negative comment or a negative review, a negative rating about something that you didn’t do very well .  So if we look at the reviews of a hotel, and we see that everyone complains abou t how noisy it is – how much noise there is in the hotel – we could say the hote l got dinged by people for all of the noise it has; it got criticized.

Marisa suggests looking at some other hotels.  Osca r says, “I’ll keep an open mind (meaning I’ll be willing to consider and think  about other things – other hotels), but I’m dubious about online reviews.”  “T o be dubious” (dubious) means to be skeptical, to be doubting, to question whethe r something is really true, whether you can really believe something.  Oscar is  dubious about online reviews, when people put their opinions on a websit e.  He says, “I take everything I read with a grain of salt.”  “To take things with a grain (grain) of salt” means to question and doubt everything that you are  told; don’t believe it just because somebody told you or just because you read it.  Although, you can believe everything we say here on ESL Podcast, so no – no need to doubt anything!  But for everything else, you might want to take it with a grain of salt. The expression means to question it, to wonder whet her it’s really true.  Why do we say “a grain of salt”?  Well, it’s a very old id ea, at least as old as the ancient Romans, that it’s easier to eat food or difficult t hings to eat with a little bit of salt. It makes it taste a little better, and so you’re go ing to be able to eat it a little more easily.  Similarly, you can accept something someon e says perhaps a little more easily if you remember that maybe it’s not all comp letely true.  That’s the grain of salt that you – you eat, if you will, to accept som ething that someone tells you.

Oscar says that he’ll take everything he reads with  a grain of salt.  “The only people who post reviews,” he says, who put their op inions on these websites, “are those who love it or hate it.”  In other words , you get people who really like something or really hate something, and so in some ways you don’t get an average opinion because you only get the extremes: people who love or hate a certain thing.

Marisa says, “I’ll just find a hotel that everyone loves.”  Oscar then says, “And that doesn’t break the bank?”  Marisa says, “Right. ”  “To break the bank” means to cost a lot of money, so much money that you don’ t have any money left in your bank; you had to spend it all on this thing that yo u are buying, in this case the hotel that you are staying at.  Oscar doesn’t want a hotel that’s going to break the bank, that’s going to be very expensive.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
