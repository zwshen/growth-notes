<h1>Problem E</h1>
<h2>Editing a Book</h2>
</center>

<p>You have <i>n</i> equal-length paragraphs numbered 1 to <i>n</i>. 
Now you want to arrange them in the order of 1, 2, ..., <i>n</i>. With the help of a clipboard, 
you can easily do this: Ctrl-X (cut) and Ctrl-V (paste) several times. You cannot cut twice 
before pasting, but you can cut several contiguous paragraphs at the same time - they'll be pasted in order.</p>

<p>For example, in order to make {2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 6}, you can cut 1 and paste before 2, then cut 3 and paste 
before 4. As another example, one copy and paste is enough for {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}. There are two ways to do so: 
cut {3, 4, 5} and paste after {1, 2}, or cut {1, 2} and paste before {3, 4, 5}. </p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single integer <i>n</i> 
(1 < <i>n</i> < 10), the number of paragraphs. The next line contains a permutation of 1, 2, 3,..., <i>n</i>. 
The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number and the minimal number of cut/paste operations.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
6
2 4 1 5 3 6
5
3 4 5 1 2
0
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 1
</pre>
