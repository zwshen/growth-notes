This episode is called “Selecting a Health Insurance Plan.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Mikhail:  What’s all this?  Carol:  It’s open enrollment at my company and I’m thinking of switching health plans.  I have an HMO right now and I’m thinking of switching to a PPO.  That way, I can see doctors outside of my current network and still be covered.  Mikhail:  I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about things like that.  I’m still a dependent on my mother’s plan, at least for another year.  Carol:  Lucky you.  Look at all of this literature!  How am I supposed to make heads or tails of this to compare one plan with another?    Mikhail:  Wow, yeah, that’s really confusing.    Carol:  Tell me about it.  I want to know if these new plans have coverage for my pre-existing conditions and prescription drugs, and if not, what the out-of-pocket costs would be.    Mikhail:  Don’t look at me.    Carol:  And how am I supposed to figure out what my copay and deductible would be?    Mikhail:  You’re on your own on this one.  It’s all Greek to me!  [end of dialogue]
