This episode is about looking back or thinking abou t one’s life.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Nick:  I’m turning 40 this year and what do I have to show for it? 

Danielle:  Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot.  Do  you know what your problem is?  Your expectations are too high and your goals are unattainable for most people.   

Nick:  Not for me.  They shouldn’t have been.  I ha d my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should. 

Danielle:  I would never have pegged you for someon e with regrets about how his life has turned out.   

Nick:  But I was supposed to make my first million dollars by the time I was 30. By 35, I should have met someone and settled down, maybe had a child or two. None of that has panned out.   

Danielle:  You have lots of friends and a full life .  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, but wouldn’t you say you were  generally content? 

Nick:  I was before I started thinking about my upc oming birthday. 

Danielle:  Then stop thinking about it.  Too much b rooding could definitely lead to regrets – not to mention premature aging! 

[end of dialogue] 

Nick begins by saying to Danielle, “I’m turning 40 this year.”  “To turn 40” means to reach the age of 40.  He says, “what do I have t o show for it?”  The expression “What do I have to show for it?” is not an actual q uestion, he is not expecting Danielle to answer; it’s really a question that say s that you are disappointed or unhappy with the results of your actions, that you have done a lot of work but not much has happened. 

Danielle says, “Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot .”  “To accomplish” (accomplish) means to achieve something, to do some thing, often something that is difficult.  Danielle says, “Do you know what you r problem is?  Your expectations are too high.”  “Expectations” comes f rom the verb “to expect.”  “To expect” is what you hope for, what you think will h appen.  Your “expectations” are what you think will happen in the future, what you believe should happen.  So if you have high expectations you are expecting a lot of success, for example.  We talk about “high expectations” and “low expectation s.”  Danielle says that Nick’s expectations are too high, higher than they should be, and that his goals are unattainable for most people.  “To attain” (attain)  means to reach or to accomplish something.  “Attainable” would be someth ing that is able to be accomplished, something you can attain.  “Unattaina ble” is something you cannot attain; it doesn’t matter how hard you try, it’s im possible or it’s too difficult. 

Nick says, “Not for me,” meaning his expectations, I guess, are not too high.  He says, “They shouldn’t have been.”  I think he’s ref erring to his goals as being unattainable.  He said, “I had my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should.”  “To plan (something) out” is a phr asal verb meaning to have a clear, detailed idea about what you are going to do .  So, Nick said that he had his life all planned out; he knew exactly what he was g oing to do and the order in which he was going to do it, but nothing is turning  out the way it should.  “To turn out” is another phrasal verb meaning to become, to have a certain result, or to end in a particular way.  You may say, “How did the  game turn out?”  That is, who won the game?  What was the final result?  In N ick’s case, he’s talking about all of the things that he planned, but they d idn’t turn out the way they should, the way he wanted them; they did not have t he result that he wanted them to have. 

Danielle is trying to be encouraging to Nick, who’s  clearly a little depressed. Maybe he needs a vacation.  I think I need a vacati on!  Anyway, Danielle says, “I would never have pegged you for someone with regret s about how his life has turned out.”  “To peg (peg) (someone)” is to catego rize someone or identify someone, to believe that someone has a certain char acteristic or certain characteristics.  So you might say, “I pegged you f or a football player,” meaning you look big; I looked at you and I thought, “Hmm, that person is a football  

player,” that’s one of his characteristics.  In thi s case, Danielle is saying that she did not peg Nick – she did not think about Nick as someone with regrets. “Regrets” (regrets) are feelings of sadness that so mething has happened, or a wish that you could do something over again differe ntly.  Something that is in the past  – that has already happened, you wish you cou ld go back in time and change it; that’s what “regrets” are.  Danielle say s that she didn’t think Nick was someone who would have regrets about how his life h as turned out – what has happened, what has resulted. 

Nick says, “But I was supposed to make my first mil lion by the time I was 30 (my first million dollars).”  He’s saying that he thoug ht he would make his first million dollars before he was 30 years old.  “By 35,” he sa ys, “I should have met someone and settled down.”  “To settle down” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning usually to get married, to buy a house, or to live a calmer life, perhaps to have children.  We talk about young men and youn g women “settling down,” eventually getting married, no longer going out as much because they have met their husband or wife.  Nick thought he would have met someone and have settled down by the time he was 35.  He says, “None  of that has panned out.” “To pan (pan) out” is similar to the verb “to turn out.”  It’s a phrasal verb meaning to be successful.  “To pan out” is, however, always  something that is successful; “turn out?” could be successful, could be not succe ssful.  But if you say, “Did it pan out?” you mean was it successful, was it what y ou were expecting to happen.  Unfortunately for Nick, his life did not p an out as he thought it would.   

Danielle says, “You have lots of friends and a full  (or complete) life.  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, bu t wouldn’t you say you were generally content?”  “To be content” (content) mean s to be happy, to be calm, to be satisfied.  You’re not sad, you’re not disappoin ted; you are relatively happy, basically happy.  There are other meanings of that word; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Nick says, “I was (meaning I was content) before I started thinking about my upcoming birthday.”  “Upcoming” (one word) means sc heduled to happen soon, something that is going to happen very soon.  Nick says that he was content until he started thinking about his 40 th  birthday, his upcoming birthday, which means he’s not yet 40; it hasn’t happened yet. 

Danielle says, “Then stop thinking about it (stop t hinking about your birthday). Too much brooding could definitely lead to regrets. ”  “To brood” (brood) means to think about something too much; you’re thinking abo ut it so much that you become worried or sad or depressed, so it’s always a negative thing.  It’s a nice word: “to brood,” to have too much thought about so mething, especially  

something that is negative.  Danielle says, “Too mu ch brooding could definitely lead to (or cause) regrets,” so if you brood you’ll  start thinking, “Oh, I wish I had done this,” or “I wish it were different,” that sor t of thing.   

Danielle says, “not to mention premature aging!”  T he phrase “not to mention” is used when you want to add an additional thing to yo ur sentence – an additional item.  Let me give you a few examples: “If you go o ut into the sun your skin might become red, not to mention you will be very thirsty .”  “Not to mention” introduces the additional idea.  Or you could say, “If you stu dy hard at school you will get a good job when you are finished, not to mention the satisfaction of knowing that you studied and succeeded.”  “Not to mention” intro duces the additional element of the satisfaction.  In this sentence, Danielle sa ys, “Too much brooding could definitely lead to regrets” – that’s one thing, “no t to mention” – another thing, which is “premature aging.”  “Aging” is the physica l changes that take place when you get older.  “Premature” means before the time t hat you would expect.  If a baby is born before the expected date we may say th at baby was “premature.” Even before he was ready, he came out of his mother ’s womb.  The “womb” is where the baby is before it’s born.  Well, “prematu re aging” would be getting older before you should be getting older, or you lo ok older than you should.  I think that’s happening to me, personally.  I think I am aging prematurely.  People think I’m in my late 40s because of the way I look.   Wait a minute…no, actually I am in my late 40s, so maybe I’m not premature aging .  Maybe I’m just getting old! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Nick:  I’m turning 40 this year and what do I have to show for it? 

Danielle:  Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot.  Do  you know what your problem is?  Your expectations are too high and your goals are unattainable for most people.   

Nick:  Not for me.  They shouldn’t have been.  I ha d my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should. 

Danielle:  I would never have pegged you for someon e with regrets about how his life has turned out.   

Nick:  But I was supposed to make my first million dollars by the time I was 30. By 35, I should have met someone and settled down, maybe had a child or two. None of that has panned out.   

Danielle:  You have lots of friends and a full life .  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, but wouldn’t you say you were  generally content? 

Nick:  I was before I started thinking about my upc oming birthday. 

Danielle:  Then stop thinking about it.  Too much b rooding could definitely lead to regrets – not to mention premature aging!
