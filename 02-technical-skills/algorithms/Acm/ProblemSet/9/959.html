<P>
You are about to participate as a co-driver in the next edition of
the ``Rallye de Monte-Carlo'' (organized by ACM - Automobile Clube
de Monaco). Before the actual race all drivers are allowed to run
on the tracks of the course. In these reconnaissance drives, the
co-drivers, who sit next to the drivers, write down shorthand
notes on how to best drive the stage.

<P>
Based on your observations on these notes, you were able to create a
map with the advisable speed limits of track sections.  Passing by
these locations over the speed limit is not recommended, since it can
make your car crash. To assist your pilot, you need to devise a
winning strategy based on the speed limits. And a nice computer
program could be handy for this task...

<P>
Given a car rally track marked with speed limits at specific
locations, your goal is to devise a strategy to reduce and increase
the car speed such that you will run the track at the fastest possible
time without ever going over the speed limit.

<P>
For simplicity the track is divided into section units, each one of
them whith a specific speed limit. At start position your car marks
speed 0 Km/h.  You can increase your speed or decrease it by multiples
of 10. For each 10 Km/h your car advances 1 unit. For example, if you
have a current speed of 50 Km/h your car advances 5 units making what
we call a move. After each move, you can change again the car
speed. You can for instance accelerate to 70 Km/h making your car
advance 7 units more, or you can brake to 40 Km/h making your car
advance 4 units.

<P>
While you are running at a determined speed (in a single move), you
can only pass track units with speed limit equal or bigger than your
current speed. For calculations purposes, a move starts on the unit
immediately after the current position. Due to mechanical limitations,
rally cars have a maximum acceleration and braking speed. For
example a car with a maximum acceleration speed of 30 Km/h and maximum
break speed of 20 Km/h, can only make an increment to the current
speed of 30, 20, 10, 0, -10 or -20 Km/h.

<P>
Your car starts the race before the first unit of the track (a
``virtual'' zero unit) and to finish the race it must pass over the
last unit of the track, passing the finish line. You can cross the
finish line at any speed. Note that arriving at the last unit is not
considered terminating the race!

<P>
Your task is to give the optimal strategy for the car, that is, the
one that minimizes the number of total moves needed to finish the
track without ever exceeding the speed limit.

<P>
The following figure illustrates a track example and its corresponding
optimal strategy (5 moves). This track is also given in sample input.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The first line of input contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, giving the number 
of test cases that follow <!-- MATH
 $(1 \le C \le 10)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(1<I>C</I>10)</SPAN>.

<P>
Each test case starts with a line containing two integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> separated by a single space, indicating the maximum values of
acceleration and braking. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> are always
multiple of 10 and <!-- MATH
 $10 \le A,B \le 240$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<I>A</I>, <I>B</I>240</SPAN>.

<P>
The next line describes the track. It is given by pairs of integers
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>NV</I></SPAN> indicating a section of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> units with speed limit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN>. 
The end of the track is indicated by an <TT>0 0</TT> pair.
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> will always be a positive multiple of 10 smaller than 250. The
maximum number of units in one track is 10000.

<P>
There is one line for each test case, containing the minimum number of
moves that a car needs to make to finish the corresponding track.
