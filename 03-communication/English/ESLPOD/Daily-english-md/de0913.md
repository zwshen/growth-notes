This episode is a dialog between Ashley and Terrell  about something called “motion sickness,” when you get sick inside of a mo ving vehicle. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ashley:  You don’t look so good.  What’s wrong?

Terrell:  I felt motion sickness watching that movi e.  The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.

Ashley:  It didn’t bother me. The hand-held camera used to film the movie had that effect on you?

Terrell:  I’m susceptible to motion sickness.  You should see me on a boat.  The rocking motion makes me seasick and nauseous.  When  I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family took a road trip.  My parents always had a barf bag ready.

 Ashley:  Wow, that sucks.

Terrell:  Yeah, and don’t even try to get me on an airplane.  Just the starting of the engines makes me feel airsick and looking down gives me vertigo.

Ashley:  So how do you travel?

Terrell:  Very rarely and usually with one foot on the ground!

Ashley says to Terrell, “You don't look so good,” m eaning you don't look very healthy. You look sick. “What's wrong?” Terrell say s, “I felt motion sickness watching that movie.” “Motion sickness” is a feelin g of what we would call “nausea,” feeling sick in your stomach or sick to  your stomach, caused usually by being in a car, or a boat, or an airplane, or some other vehicle, some other means of transportation.

Terrell, however, was not in a vehicle. He was watc hing a movie, and he says the movie gave him motion sickness. Terrell said, “The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.” Terrell is saying that the camera m oved back and forth suddenly and quickly from one place to another. Tha t's what he means by the phrasal verb “to jerk (jerk) around” – to move quic kly back and forth. This term can also be used informally when you have a situati on where you are, perhaps, not treating someone very well. You tell them one t hing and then five minutes later you tell them another thing. This is especial ly true if you’re a boss, or if you're in charge of another person. “To jerk someon e around” is a very negative way of describing someone's behavior and how they a re treating another person. They're treating them by making decisions that chan ge very quickly.

Terrell is talking about a camera that is moving ba ck and forth. He says the cameras jerking around made him “dizzy” (dizzy). “D izzy” is a feeling in your head that everything is moving or spinning around y ou. When you're dizzy, you feel like you may fall down. If you spin around in a circle ten times, you'll feel dizzy. You'll feel like you might fall down.

Ashley said the movie didn't bother her, didn't aff ect her. She then asks Terrell, “The hand-held camera used to film the movie had th at affect on you?” “Hand- held” is something you hold in one of your hands. A  “camera,” of course, is used to film or to record the movie. So, a “hand-held ca mera” would be a camera used, usually, to make a movie, although it could j ust be a camera used to take

pictures. In some movies nowadays, the makers of the movie will use a hand- held camera because they think perhaps it provides a more “realistic” image for the people watching the movie, although, I’m not a filmmaker, so I can’t give you any exact explanations.

Ashley is asking Terrell if the hand-held camera th at was jerking around had that “effect on you.” “That effect” refers to motion sic kness. An “effect” (effect) is a result or an outcome or a consequence. Terrell says , “I’m susceptible to motion sickness.” When you’re “susceptible (susceptible) t o something,” you are very easily affected by it or can easily have a problem with it. “Susceptible” is usually used when talking about, for example, an illness or  a sickness, or something negative in your behavior. Young children may be su sceptible to colds. They may be more likely to get a cold, or a sick person with  an infection is more susceptible to serious health problems, because they are sick. Terrell says he’s susceptible to motion sickness.

He says, “You should see me on a boat.” That expres sion, “you should see me,” means you have to imagine this situation because I would really show you or you would really understand it if you were to see me in  this other situation. For example, you should see me on a bicycle. I am a won derful bicyclist. That’s not true, but the example here is that you can imagine that person, and if you did see the person in that situation, you would realize exa ctly what they're talking about.

Terrell says, “The rocking motion” – on a boat – “m akes me seasick and nauseous.” A “rocking (rocking) motion” is a motion  that goes back and forth many times, usually somewhat slowly. “To be seasick ” (seasick) – one word – means to have motion sickness caused by being on wa ter, by being in a boat or ship. That's “seasick.” It's just the same as motio n sickness. “Motion sickness” is the general term. If you're on a boat, we might cal l it “seasickness.” If you’re in car, it would be to be “carsick,” and so forth.

“Nauseous” as I mentioned earlier, means feeling si ck to your stomach, like you're going to vomit, like you're going to throw u p. Terrell says, “When I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family too k a road trip.” So, now we see that word “carsick” that I just mentioned. That mea ns getting motion sickness by being in a car. A “road trip” is when you take a lo ng driving trip somewhere. The United States is a very big country, and it's popul ar for people to take road trips, to travel to, say, a different state to see a natio nal park, or to visit a different city. These are driving trips that can often take several  days. When I was young boy, my father, who was a schoolteacher, would take us o n road trips in the summer time when he didn't have to work. One road trip was  almost six weeks long. That was a really, really long trip.

 Anyway, Terrell says that his parents always had a “barf bag” ready. A “barf (barf) bag” is a somewhat informal term to describe  a small paper bag that you usually find on an airplane for people who get moti on sickness and are going to be physically sick, who are going to throw up. Thes e bags are used so that you can not make a mess, basically. “Barf” (barf) as a verb means to vomit, but it's a word that is only used informally.

Ashley says, “Wow, that sucks.” This is, again, a v ery informal use of a verb. “To suck” as a verb here means to be terrible, to be aw ful. It's very informal, and probably not one you'd want to use in a business se tting. Some people still think it's a little vulgar, even. So, I would be careful about using this. It is, however, used commonly in conversation, and you'll certainly  hear it in movies and television shows. When someone says something “suck s,” they mean it's bad. It's very bad.

Terrell agrees. He says, “Yeah, and don't even try to get me on an airplane.” “Don't even try” means, “Do not attempt to (in this  case) get me on an airplane.” Of course, you can imagine that Terrell would get s ick on an airplane as well. He says, “Just the starting of the engines makes me fe el airsick.” The “engines” (engines) are the motors, the machines that give the airplane energy so it can fly. Terrell is saying as soon as the engines start, as soon as they start working, they start running on an airplane, he starts to get airs ick. “Airsickness” is when you have motion sickness on an airplane.

So, now we have “seasick,” “carsick,” and “airsick”  for motion sickness on a boat, in a car, and on an airplane. Terrell says that loo king down gives him “vertigo.” “Vertigo” (vertigo) is a feeling of dizziness cause d by being up at a very high location. If you are in a very tall building, and y ou look out the window down to the street, you might get vertigo. It might cause y ou to be dizzy. There was a famous Alfred Hitchcock movie called Vertigo .

Ashley says, “So, how do you travel?” How do you ge t from one place to another if you always have motion sickness? Terrell says, “ Very rarely,” not very often, “and usually with one foot on the ground,” meaning he walks. He doesn't take any sort of vehicle to get from one place to anothe r.

Now let's listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.
