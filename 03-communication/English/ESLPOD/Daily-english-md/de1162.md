This episode is a dialogue between Suzanna and Kenj i about staying in a hotel that doesn’t cost very much. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleaba g motel in the seedy part of town?

Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommo dations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Reme mber?

Suzanna: I remember, but I didn’t bargain for somep lace as run-down as this. Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.

Kenji: It’s pretty bad, isn’t it? Look on the brigh t side. At least it’s not rat-infested.

Suzanna: That’s small comfort. Well, I think I’ll t ake a short nap before we go out for dinner. Uh!

Kenji: What’s the matter?

Suzanna: This comforter is filthy. I doubt housekee ping has changed it in months!

Kenji: Let’s get out of here and go get a drink. Th at should cheer us up.

Suzanna: Good idea. If I have more than one, maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.

 Kenji: Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher!

Suzanna begins our dialogue by asking Kenji, “Remin d me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?” When  someone begins a question with “Remind me why” or “Remind me,” usually the pe rson is not very happy with the situation, or perhaps confused about something – something he doesn’t understand. For example, if you go to a movie and i t’s a really bad movie, a movie recommended by your friend, you may say to yo ur friend, “Remind me why we’re watching this stupid movie?” You’re criti cizing, of course, your friend’s choice.

That’s what Suzanna is doing here. She’s in effect criticizing Kenji for having them stay in this “fleabag motel.” A “motel” (motel ) is like a hotel but it’s usually smaller and less expensive. The “m,” I believe, ori ginally comes from “motor,” meaning it was a hotel that was designed for people  who were and are traveling by car. Usually a motel has doors that face out or that look out onto the parking lot where the cars are.

The term “fleabag” (fleabag) describes a hotel or p erhaps another temporary housing place that is dirty, old, and usually falli ng apart, often with not very clean living conditions. The rooms aren’t clean. The hote l itself isn’t very clean. The word “fleabag” comes from “flea” (flea). A flea is a small animal that you usually associate with dogs, for example, or other small an imals. Technically, a “flea” is a small insect that feeds off of the blood of another  animal. If your dog has fleas, your dog will often scratch at the fleas or the fle a bites.

“Fleabag,” then, would describe a very dirty, not v ery nice hotel or motel. Suzanne is wondering why they are staying “in this fleabag motel in the seedy (seedy) part of town.” The word “seedy” refers to a n area, perhaps even a person who is somewhat suspicious, possibly even criminal.  It could also describe a place that is dirty or disgusting or unsafe. If you  say, “That’s a seedy character,” you mean that’s a person whom you can’t really trus t, a person who might even be a criminal.

To describe a hotel as “seedy” would usually indica te that it’s not a very clean hotel, possibly even a hotel that is used for crimi nal activity, including prostitution. Kenji says, “We agreed that we would skimp on the a ccommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out . Remember?” “To skimp (skimp) on” something is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to spend a very small

amount on something – much less than most people wo uld normally spend – in order to save money, although you could also skimp on something because you don’t want very much of it.

There’s an adjective “skimpy” (skimpy) which descri bes someone who isn’t wearing very much clothing. If a woman is wearing a  “skimpy outfit” (outfit), she’s not wearing very much clothing. A “bikini,” for exa mple, might be described as being skimpy. But here, the phrasal verb “to skimp on” means not spending very much money. Kenji says that he and Suzanna agreed t hey would not spend very much money on accommodations. “Accommodations” (acc ommodations) refers to a place where you stay when you are traveling, s uch as a hotel.

Another word for “accommodations” is “lodging” (lod ging). Although, you don’t hear that word as much anymore unless you’re talkin g about your expenses for your company. If you travel, your company might ask  you to give them receipts for your lodging, for your accommodations, basicall y for your hotel room. Kenji says the agreement that he and Suzanna had was “to skimp on accommodations” so they could spend more money on “ eating out” – that is, on eating in a restaurant.

Suzanna says she remembers this, “But,” she says, “ I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this.” If someone says, “I  didn’t bargain (bargain) for “something, she means she didn’t anticipate or inte nd to do something. Usually when you say, “I didn’t bargain for this,” you mean  you are surprised in a negative way because you didn’t expect this or you didn’t think you agreed to do this.

“To be run-down” means to be in very poor condition  – to be very old, to be perhaps falling apart. You could describe a buildin g as being “run-down.” “This apartment building is run-down.” It’s not taken car e of very well. There are things that are broken. It might be a little dirty. That w ould all be part of this description of being “run-down.”

Suzanna says, “Look at the peeling wallpaper and mo ldy bathroom.” “Wallpaper” is paper, that usually has a certain color or decor ation, that you put up on a wall instead of painting it. That’s why the term “wallpa per” makes so much sense. It’s paper that you put on the wall. If wallpaper isn’t put down properly, or if it’s very old, it will start to “peel” (peel). The verb “to p eel” here means for the wallpaper to begin to come off the wall, especially from the top  of the wall.

“To peel” can also mean to remove the outer layer o f something. You could peel a potato. You could take the outer layer, what we w ould call the “skin” (skin) of

the potato, off. So, “peeling wallpaper” is wallpap er that is falling off. A “moldy (moldy) bathroom” is one in which there is fungus –  something that is caused usually by moisture. You don’t want mold in your ba throom. It can cause a lot of problems, including health problems.

Kenji said, “It’s pretty bad isn’t it,” meaning thi s motel is pretty bad. “Look on the bright side,” he says. This expression “to look on the bright (bright) side” is used when you are asking someone to find something good or positive in a bad situation. It’s another way of saying “be optimisti c,” “be positive,” “look for the good things here.” He says, “At least it’s not rat- infested.”

The positive thing that Kenji points out about this  motel is that it doesn’t have rats – small little animals that you don’t really want t o see in your house or hotel room. The term “rat-infested” (infested) just means  full of rats, or lots of rats. Suzanna says, “That’s small comfort,” meaning it’s a good thing but not very much.

“Well,” she says, “I think I’ll take a short nap” –  a short time to sleep – “before we go out for dinner.” “Uh!” she says. Kenji says, “Wh at’s the matter?” meaning what’s wrong. Suzanna says, “This comforter is filt hy.” A “comforter” (comforter) is a thick, warm blanket that you put on a bed. If something is “filthy” (filthy) it’s very dirty, it’s very unclean.

Suzanna continues, “I doubt housekeeping has change d it in months!” In a hotel or a motel, there usually is a group of people who go around cleaning the rooms, usually every day. That group of people is called, collectively, “housekeeping” (housekeeping). These are the people – I’ll have to  say, in most hotels in the United States, usually women – who go around and cl ean the rooms or who are supposed to clean the rooms. Suzanne is complaining  that the comforter probably has not been “changed” or cleaned in many months.

Kenji says, “Let’s get out of here and go get a dri nk,” meaning an alcoholic drink. “That should cheer us up,” he says. “To cheer someo ne up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make you happy. Suzanna say s, “Good idea,” meaning yes, that is a good idea. “If I have more than one, ” meaning more than one drink, “maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.”

Kenji says, “Given the state of this room, we might  need an entire pitcher.” “Given” here means considering or in reference to. “The state of this room” refers to the condition of this room. Kenji is saying, the n, that because of how bad this room is, “we might need an entire pitcher” (pitcher ). A “pitcher” is a large container. Here Kenji is referring to a large pitch er of beer, I’m guessing.

 Kenji is saying that because the room is in such ba d condition, he and Suzanna might need to drink a whole pitcher of beer in orde r to feel better, in order to be cheered up enough so that they can continue staying  in this fleabag motel.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
