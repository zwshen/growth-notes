The Green Earth Trading Company sells 4 different sizes of energy-efficient 
fluorescent light bulbs for use in home lighting fixtures. The light bulbs are 
expensive, but last much longer than ordinary incandescent light bulbs and 
require much less energy. To encourage customers to buy and use the energy-
efficient light bulbs, the company catalogue lists special packages which 
contain a variety of sizes and numbers of the light bulbs. The price of a 
package is always substantially less than the total price of the individual 
bulbs in the package. Customers typically want to buy several different sizes 
and numbers of bulbs. You are to write a program to determine the least 
expensive collection of packages that satisfy any customer's request.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input file contains several datasets. Each dataset is divided into two parts. The first one describes the packages 
which are listed in the catalogue. The second part describes individual 
customer requests. The 4 sizes of light bulbs are identified in the input file 
by the characters ``<TT>a</TT>&quot;, ``<TT>b</TT>&quot;, ``<TT>c</TT>&quot;, and ``<TT>d</TT>&quot;.
<P>
<P>
The first part of the dataset begins with an integer <I>n</I> ( <IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="233img1.gif"  > )
indicating the number of packages described in the catalogue. Each of the <I>n</I>
lines that follows is a single package description. A package description 
begins with a catalogue number (a positive integer) followed by a price (a 
real number), and then the sizes and corresponding numbers of the light bulbs 
in the package. Between 1 and 4 different sizes of light bulbs will be listed 
in each description. The listing format for these size-number pairs is a 
blank, a character (``<TT>a</TT>&quot;, ``<TT>b</TT>&quot;, ``<TT>c</TT>&quot;, or ``<TT>d</TT>&quot;) representing a size, another blank,
and then an integer representing the number of light bulbs of that size in the 
package. These size-number pairs will not appear in any particular order, and 
there will be no duplicate sizes listed in any package. The following line 
describes a package with catalogue number 210 and price $76.95 which contains
3 size ``<TT>a</TT>&quot; bulbs, 1 size ``<TT>c</TT>&quot; bulb, and 4 size ``<TT>d</TT>&quot; bulbs.

<P>
<P>
The second part of the dataset begins with a line containing a single
positive integer <I>m</I> representing the number of customer requests. Each of the
remaining <I>m</I> lines is a customer request. A listing of sizes and corresponding
numbers of light bulbs constitutes a request. Each list contains only the 
size-number pairs, formatted the same way that the size-number pairs are 
formatted in the catalogue descriptions. Unlike the catalogue descriptions, 
however, a customer request may contain duplicate sizes. The following line 
represents a customer request for 1 size ``<TT>a</TT>&quot; bulb, 2 size ``<TT>b</TT>&quot; bulbs, 2 size
``<TT>c</TT>&quot; bulbs, and 5 size ``<TT>d</TT>&quot; bulbs.

<P>
For each request, print the customer number (1 through <I>m</I>, 1 for the first
customer request, 2 for the second,  <IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline54" SRC="233img2.gif"  > , <I>m</I> for the  <IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline58" SRC="233img3.gif"  >  customer), a colon, the
total price of the packages which constitute the least expensive way to fill 
the request, and then the combination of packages that the customer should 
order to fill that request.
<P>
<P>
Prices should be shown with exactly two significant digits to the right of the 
decimal. The combination of packages must be written in ascending order of 
catalogue numbers. If more than one of the same type package is to be ordered, 
then the number ordered should follow the catalogue number in parentheses. You 
may assume that each customer request can be filled. In some cases, the least 
expensive way to fill a customer request may contain more light bulbs of some 
sizes than necessary to fill the actual request. This is acceptable. What 
matters is that the customers receive <I>at least</I> what they request.
<p>Print a blank line after each dataset.
