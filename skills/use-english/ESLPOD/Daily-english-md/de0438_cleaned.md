Today’s episode is a dialogue between Heather and Sam,  talking about renting an apartment.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Heather:  Hi, are you the apartment manager?  I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartment. 

Sam:  Yes, I’m Sam.  We have one unit available right now.  When are you looking to move in? 

Heather:  The lease on my apartment is up soon, so I’d like to move in the first of the month. 

Sam:  Okay, follow me and let me show you the unit.  Ea ch unit gets one parking space in the garage, and there are laundry facilities o n the first floor.  The landlord pays for the gas, but the tenant pays for all other utilities.  Here’s the unit.  Take a look around. 

Heather:  Oh, this is nice.  Is this a furnished unit?   

Sam:  It can be furnished or unfurnished, your choice.  S ince it’s an end unit, there’s only one common wall.   

Heather:  This apartment is exactly what I’m looking for .  How much is the rent? 

 Sam:  It’s $900 a month and we require a 12-month le ase.  To move in, you’ll need to have the first and last month’s rent, plus a secur ity deposit. 

Heather:  How much is the security deposit? 

Sam:  It’s $450. 

Heather:  Okay, I’ll think it over and get back to you.  T hanks for your time. 

Sam:  These units go fast, so if you’re interested, I su ggest that you jump on it. 

Heather:  Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind. 

[end of dialogue] 

Heather begins the dialogue by asking Sam, “Are you the apartment manager?” In an apartment building – which is, of course, a build ing with many different places for people to live – the manager is the person wh o takes care of the building, the person who takes care of problems in the building.  Heather says, “I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartme nt.”  The “vacancy (vacancy) sign” is a sign that says that there is a room or ro oms for rent – that are available.  You will see a vacancy sign, for example, in front of a hotel; that means the hotel has rooms to rent.  If it says “no vacancy,” it has no rooms to rent.  For an apartment building, a vacancy sign means t hat there is at least one apartment that is available to rent. 

Sam says, “Yes, I’m Sam.  We have one unit available righ t now.”  A “unit,” in this dialogue, means one of the apartments; it refers to an  apartment.  Sometimes people may even say an “apartment unit,” or just “the u nit.”  It’s a term that you will hear more from someone who works in the apartment  business, like a manager, or someone who works in real estate.  “Unit” h as several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Sam says, “When are you looking to move in?” meaning whe n do you want to – when are you looking to move in.  “To move in” means th at you want to take all of your furniture and things, and bring them to the apar tment to live.  When do you want to start renting the apartment?  Heather says, “Th e lease on my apartment is up soon.”  A “lease” (lease) is a legal contract – a le gal agreement – between, in this case, the person who owns the apartment building  and you, the person  

 renting the apartment.  You can have a lease for a hou se; you can have a lease for a car.  You can rent your car for a day or a week or  several months.  The lease on Heather’s apartment is up soon.  “To be up,” i n this case, means to end, to finish, to expire: “The president’s term is up in Janu ary of next year.”  The term is up – the term is over; it is finished.  Heather says, “I ’d like to move in the first of the month,” meaning the first day of the month, so Janu ary 1st or February 1st, and so forth.  In the U.S., it’s common for leases to begin at the first of the month; sometimes they begin on the 15th of the month, so halfway into the month. 

Sam says, “Okay, follow me and let me show you the unit.  Each unit gets one parking space in the garage,” meaning one place for you to park one car.  He also says that there are laundry facilities on the first f loor.  “Laundry” is another word for clothes that you want to wash – dirty clothes.  Someone says “I have to go do the laundry,” they mean “I have to go wash my cloth es.”  So, “laundry facilities” are washers and dryers for clothing.  Many apar tment buildings in the U.S. have laundry facilities in the building.  If there  is no laundry facility – place for you to wash your clothes – then you have to go to what ’s called a “Laundromat,” which is a place separate from the build ing that anyone can come and wash their clothes and dry them. 

Sam says, “The landlord pays for the gas, but the tenant pays for all other utilities.”  The “landlord” is the person who actually o wns the apartment building, or the house, or whatever is being rented.  A business bu ilding would have a landlord, for example.  The “manager” is the person wh o takes care of the problems – the day-to-day problems – the everyday problems in the building, but the landlord is the person who actually owns the buildin g.  The “tenant” (tenant) is the person who is renting the apartment or the hou se.  So in this case, it would be Heather; she wants to rent the unit from the landl ord. 

So the landlord pays for the gas – the natural gas, but  the tenant pays for all other utilities.  The word “utilities,” when we’re ta lking about apartments or houses, refers to the water, the electricity, the gas, oth er things that a person needs to live on; things that are services provided by some co mpany or by the government.  So, for example, for my house we have a g as bill, we have an electricity bill; those are utilities.  We also have a w ater bill and a bill for the garbage collection.  So, these things must be paid for b y Heather. 

Sam says, “Here’s the unit.  Take a look around.”  Heathe r says, “Oh, this is nice. Is this a furnished unit?”  When something is “furnished, ” that means that it has furniture in there, that the landlord has put in a b ed, and a sofa, and a table and  

 chairs, and so forth.  Most apartments in the U.S., howe ver, are “unfurnished,” meaning they’re empty; you have to bring your own thing s into the apartment. Sam says, “It can be furnished or unfurnished, your choice. ”  Furnished is more common for apartments for students, who may not have thin gs to move into the apartment – furniture – especially if they live in a dif ferent city from where they are renting.   

Sam says, “Since it’s an end unit (meaning it’s at the ed ge of the building – there isn’t another apartment on the other side), there’s on ly one common wall.”  A “common wall” is a wall that you share with another apa rtment.  So, if you have an apartment on the first floor in between two other  apartments, you probably have at least two common walls: one for the apartment o n the right, one for the apartment on the left.  Hopefully, the walls are thick so you don’t hear the person next to you.  That’s sometimes a problem with apartments,  especially the apartments I used to rent when I was renting back as a st udent. 

Heather says, “This apartment is exactly what I’m looking f or (it’s just what I want).  How much is the rent (how much money do I have to pay each month)?” Sam says, “It’s $900 a month and we require a 12-month lease.”  So she must agree to rent it for a whole year at $900 each month.   “To move in,” Sam says, “you’ll need to have the first and last month’s rent, p lus a security deposit.” That’s a very common policy in the U.S.  If you are going to rent an apartment for one year, you have to pay the first and the last month’s rent right away, as well as a security deposit.  A “security deposit” is money that you  give the owner of the property – the landlord – to hold in case there ar e any problems, in case, for example, that you damage the apartment.  The word “se curity,” here, doesn’t mean safety; it means something that I am holding of you rs just to be sure that nothing goes wrong.  So, the security deposit that Heat her has to pay is $450. Security deposits are usually about half of the rent, som etimes less. 

Heather says, “Okay, I’ll think it over (I’ll think about it) and get back to you.”  “To get back to someone” means to give an answer to someone at  a later time. Someone asks you to go to a party, and you say, “Well, I’ ll get back to you on that.  I’ll call you tomorrow.”  

Sam says, “These units go fast (meaning they rent quickly),  so if you’re interested, I suggest that you jump on it.”  “To jump o n it” means to do it right away, not to wait.  Especially if you are talking about so mething you are going to buy or something that you have to pay for, if someone sa ys “you should really  

 jump on it,” it’s a good deal – it’s a good price.  Th at is the meaning of the expression, to do it right away. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
