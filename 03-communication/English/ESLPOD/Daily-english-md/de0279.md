# Saying Goodbye

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 279: Saying Goodbye.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 279.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  In this episode, we are going to learn how to say goodbye to someone that you know.  Let's get started.  > Mina:  I’d better be going.  See you later.  Oliver:  It might be awhile before we run into each other again.  Mina:  Why is that?  Oliver:  I’m going to Puerto Rico for three months starting next Tuesday.  I got a job there for the summer.  Mina:  I didn’t know that.  That’s great!  I’ve never been to Puerto Rico, but I’ve heard it’s nice.  Have a good trip.  It’s a shame we didn’t have more time to catch up.  Is your girlfriend going with you?     Oliver:  Yeah, she is.  She got a job there, too, so we won’t have to be apart for three months.    Mina:  That’s good.  It’s too bad I won’t get to see her before you two leave.  Give her my best.  Oliver:  I will.  Oh, I’d better get going or I’ll be late.  Mina:  It was good seeing you.  Oliver:  You, too.  Stay in touch.  Mina:  I will.  Let’s get together when you get back from Puerto Rico.  Oliver:  I’d like that.  Bye.
