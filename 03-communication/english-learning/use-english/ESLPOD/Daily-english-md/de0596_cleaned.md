[start of dialogue]  Agency Employee:  Hello, state unemployment agency.  George:  Hello, I’d like to apply for unemployment benefits.    Agency Employee:  Okay, give me your address and I’ll send you an application.    George:  How much can I get?  Agency Employee:  That depends.  Your benefits are calculated based on your quarterly earnings.  You were laid off from your job?  George:  Yes, I was.  I qualify, don’t I?  Agency Employee:  People who work part-time jobs or are self-employed aren’t eligible.  If you worked in a full-time position, you should qualify.  Fill out the application and we’ll let you know.  George:  What else does the application ask for?
