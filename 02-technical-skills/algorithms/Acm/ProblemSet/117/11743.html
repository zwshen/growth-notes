<h2>Problem B: Credit Check</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11743.jpg" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>These days, it has become commonplace to make purchases over the
internet using a credit card. However, because credit card numbers are
relatively long, it is easy to make a mistake while typing them in. In
order to quickly identify errors like typos, most e-commerce websites
use a checksum algorithm to verify credit card numbers.</p>
<p>One popular checksum algorithm is the Luhn algorithm, which can
detect any single-digit error as well as many common multiple-digit
errors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting with the second-last digit and moving backwards, double every other digit to obtain a list of numbers.</li>
<li>Add up the digits of these numbers, then add the undoubled digits from the original number.  Sum the two results.</li>
<li>If the total ends in a 0, the credit card number is valid, and it is invalid otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, using the number 5181 2710 9900 0012:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double the appropriate digits (<strong>5</strong>1<strong>8</strong>1 <strong>2</strong>7<strong>1</strong>0 <strong>9</strong>9<strong>0</strong>0 <strong>0</strong>0<strong>1</strong>2) to obtain the values: 10, 16, 4, 2, 18, 0, 0, 2.</li>
<li>Add up the digits of these values to get (1+0) + (1+6) + 4 + 2 +
(1+8) + 0 + 0 + 2 = 25. The sum of the undoubled digits is
1+1+7+0+9+0+0+2 = 20, so the total is 20+25=45.</li>
<li>45 does not end in a 0, so this credit card number is invalid.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this problem, you must write a program that checks the validity of credit card numbers according to the Luhn algorithm.</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>The input begins with a number <em>N</em> on a single line, followed by <em>N</em> lines each containing a single credit card number.
Each credit card number consists of 16 decimal digits in groups of four separated by single spaces.</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>The output consists of one line for each input credit card number.
If the credit card number is valid, this line consists of the string
"Valid", otherwise it reads "Invalid".</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>2
5181 2710 9900 0012
5181 2710 9900 0017
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>Invalid
Valid
