An “allergy” is a kind of illness where you eat something or you breathe something that gives you an uncomfortable reaction, basically it makes you sick.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Victor:  Oh, doctor, you’ve got to help me!  Doctor:  Try to relax.  What seems to be the problem?  Victor:  I’m sneezing all the time, and my eyes are itchy and watery.  Doctor:  Tilt your head back so I can take a look at your nasal passages.  You’re very congested.  Victor:  My sinuses are killing me!  I have headaches all the time and nothing I do seems to help.  Doctor:  What is this on your skin?  Victor:  I don’t know.  I’ve had red spots all over my body.  Doctor:  They look like hives to me.  Are you experiencing any shortness of breath?  Victor:   Well, my chest feels constricted and it’s hard to breathe.
