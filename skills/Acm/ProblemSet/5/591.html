<P>
Little Bob likes playing with his box of bricks. He puts the bricks one upon another and builds
stacks of different height. ``Look, I've built a wall!'', he tells his older sister Alice. ``Nah, you should
make all stacks the same height. Then you would have a real wall.'', she retorts. After a little con-
sideration, Bob sees that she is right. So he sets out to rearrange the bricks, one by one, such that all
stacks are the same height afterwards. But since Bob is lazy he wants to do this with the minimum
number of bricks moved. Can you help?

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input consists of several data sets. Each set begins with a line containing the number <I>n</I> of stacks
Bob has built. The next line contains <I>n</I> numbers, the heights <I>h</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> of the <I>n</I> stacks. You may assume

<!-- MATH: $1 Ÿ\le n \leŸ 50$ -->

 ALT="$1 Ÿ\le n \leŸ 50$">
and

 ALT="$1 \leŸ h_i Ÿ\le 100$">.

<P>
The total number of bricks will be divisible by the number of stacks. Thus, it is always possible
to rearrange the bricks such that all stacks have the same height.

<P>
The input is terminated by a set starting with <I>n</I> = 0. This set should not be processed.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each set, first print the number of the set, as shown in the sample output. Then print the line
``<TT>The minimum number of moves is </TT><I>k</I>.'', where <I>k</I> is the minimum number of bricks that
have to be moved in order to make all the stacks the same height.

<P>
Output a blank line after each set.
