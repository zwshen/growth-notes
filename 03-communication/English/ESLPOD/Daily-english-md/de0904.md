[start of dialog]

Danielle:  I’m so excited!  I just got my new posti ng overseas.  I can’t wait to live abroad and work as an expat.

Angus:  I remember my first overseas assignment.  I t was interesting, but the adjustment took some time.

Danielle:  I won’t have any problems.  I already ha ve my work permit and vaccinations, and I speak the language fairly well.   And remember, I don’t have any family to relocate.

Angus:  I didn’t think I’d have any problems either , but when I got to McQuillanland, I was in culture shock.

Danielle:  I’m ready for the differences in the cos t of living.  I’ll be getting a housing allowance, which will offset the increase i n living expenses.

Angus:  I wasn’t thinking so much about the expense  of living abroad.  I was referring to a different pace of life and the many cultural differences that affect every facet of life.

Danielle:  That’s what I’m looking forward to.  It’ ll all be so exciting.

Angus:  I’m glad you’re in euphoria right now, but be prepared for some bumps in the road.

Danielle:  No problem.  To me, smooth sailing would  be boring!

Our dialog begins with Danielle saying to Angus, “I 'm so excited. I just got my new posting overseas.” The word “posting” (posting)  is used for people who work in jobs that frequently require moving from one pla ce to another. A large company, for example, might have offices in many di fferent countries. So, a manager might have a posting in one country and the n a posting in another country. It's not normally used for jobs that don't  require you to move to different places, either within a country or to another count ry. So, for example, a schoolteacher probably wouldn't refer to his or her  new job as a “posting” because it doesn't involve traveling to different p arts of the world or of the country.

But Danielle obviously works for a company that req uires her to move frequently, and her new posting is overseas. “Overseas” (overse as) means in another country. A “sea” (sea) is an ocean. “Overseas” woul d be over or across an ocean. Now technically, a job would be overseas, if  you lived in the United States, if that job were in Europe, Asia, Africa, A ustralia, the Middle East, and so forth – anything that would require you to travel o ver an ocean in order to get there. Hawaii is part of the United States. So, you  wouldn't be traveling overseas if you were working in Hawaii. Overseas always refe rs to a foreign country, another country not your own. Now, many people use overseas to mean the same as the next word in our dialogue which is “abr oad.”

Danielle says, “I can't wait to live abroad.” “Abro ad” always  means in another country. “Overseas” means in another country, or it  can mean specifically, in another country that is not connected to, in this c ase, the United States. So, if you were working in Canada or Mexico, you might not  say that I'm working overseas. You might say “I'm working abroad,” but it's perfectly acceptable to use overseas, even when you don't actually have to trav el over an ocean.

Danielle says that she can't wait to live abroad, m eaning she's very excited about living abroad. She's also excited about working as an expat. An “expat” (expat) is short for “expatriate” (expatriate). An expatriate is a person who lives in a foreign country, who lives in another country, not his own.  So, if you move to the United States from another country and work here, you woul d be considered an expat. If I go to Mexico to teach English, I would be called an ex-pat.

Angus says, “I remember my first overseas assignmen t.” An “assignment” is the same as a posting. “It was interesting, but the adj ustment took some time.”

“Adjustment” is when you have to change your behavi or to adapt to a new situation, or a new environment. When you move to a  different country, there are many things that are new and so there is a period o r a time of adjustment.

Danielle says, “I won't have any problems. I alread y have my work permit” – her permission from the government of this foreign coun try to work there – “and vaccinations.” “Vaccinations” are injections that y ou get from the doctor to protect you against some diseases that might be present in a foreign country that is not present in your own country.

Danielle says, “I speak the language fairly well,” meaning pretty well, very well but not perfectly. “And remember,” she says, “I don 't have any family to relocate.” “To relocate” means to move from one place to anoth er, to leave your home or apartment and move to a completely different, usual ly, town or state, or in this case, country. You may know that the prefix “re” me ans again. So, “relocate” means in a way to find yourself again in another pl ace, to move yourself to another place.

Angus says, “I didn't think I'd” – I would – “have any problems either, but when I got to McQuillanland” – the new country – “I was in  culture shock.” “Culture shock” is a feeling of confusion, of unhappiness, t hat often happens when you move to a new place, when you move to a new country . Usually, when you move to somewhere for the first time and you want to go there, you’re very happy during the first, maybe month, two months, maybe ev en six months that you're there. We sometimes call that situation, that condi tion, “euphoria.” (euphoria). After this period of euphoria, however, usually you  go through another part of your adjustment which is culture shock.

“Culture shock” is when you feel like you're confus ed or you're angry, or you don't really understand and like the new place that you'r e living. This happens to everyone that I've ever met who's lived in another country, including myself. At first, everything is great but then you go through a period where things are very difficult. You look around and you say, “I'm not li ke these people here.” This happens even when you move to a different part of y our country.

When I moved to Los Angeles, I went through culture  shock after the first year or so of living here. If you are able to survive that stage, that period of culture shock, things will get better, and you'll have a more real istic, balanced view of the place where you live after perhaps, a year or two, but so metimes culture shock can be so serious that it causes people to move back to wh ere they came from.

Angus says he went through culture shock when he mo ved to McQuillanland. Danielle says, “I'm ready for the differences in the cost of living.” The “cost of living” is how much it costs you to live in a certa in place, how much the food is, how much the rent is, and so forth. All of those are part of the cost of living. In some countries, the cost of living is much higher t han in other countries. In some cities like Los Angeles, the cost of living is much  higher than in other cities.

Danielle says that she'll be getting a housing allo wance. A “housing allowance” is money that a company gives you to pay for the rent of your house, or apartment when you are working in a different city or a diffe rent country. Danielle says the housing allowance will “offset” the increase in “li ving expenses.”

“To offset” (offset) means to have the opposite eff ect. In this case, even though the cost of living will be higher, the housing allo wance will pay for that. It will counteract, we might say, that. It will offset it. It will balance it. She says the housing allowance will offset the increase in livin g expenses. “Living expenses” is basically the same as cost of living – what it cost s you to rent your apartment, to drive your car, to buy your food and so forth. Angu s says, “I wasn't thinking so much about the expense” – the money required – “of living abroad. I was referring to a different pace of life.” “Pace” (pac e) is like speed. “Pace of life” would be how rushed people are, how relaxed people are. The pace of life in New York and Los Angeles is much faster than the pa ce of life in Honolulu, Hawaii, or in a small town in Minnesota. That's “pa ce of life.”

Angus says, “There are many cultural differences th at affect every facet of life.” “Facet” (facet) means part or feature. Danielle say s, “That's what I'm looking forward to. It'll all be so exciting.” It will all be very exciting.

Angus says, “I'm glad you're in euphoria right now”  – we explained euphoria a few minutes ago – “ but be prepared for some bumps in the road.” “Bumps in the road” is an expression meaning difficulties or chal lenges that you will have to face on your way to reaching your goal, on the way to your destination. There’ll be bumps in the road. Literally, “bumps” are where the earth of the road goes up a little higher and it causes your car to bounce a little bit as you go over the bump. “Bumps in the road,” however, is an expressio n meaning difficulties in obtaining or achieving your goal.

Danielle says, “No problem. To me, smooth sailing w ould be boring.” Danielle is not worried about difficulties or bumps in the road . She thinks that the opposite of that would be boring. The opposite expression for b umps in the road is, in a way, “smooth sailing.” “Smooth sailing” means you don't have any problems. You are able to reach your goal without having any difficul ties. “Sailing” is when you go

out in a boat and you let the power of the wind mov e the boat back and forth. “Smooth” is the opposite of rough or in this case, difficult. “Smooth sailing” is not having any difficulties.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
