# Using Renewable Energy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 866: Using Renewable Energy

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 866. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Carl and Jody, abo ut using energy wisely, using energy that is renewable. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Carl:  Uh!  What’s that smell?

Jody:  I’m working on my latest invention.  I’m tur ning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.

Carl:  Why?  There are already lots of types of ren ewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!

Jody:  Well, I think I’m onto a better alternative.   Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel.  That’s the wave of t he future.

Carl:  You mean you think that it would be more eff icient than wind power and solar energy?  There are geothermal and hydroelectr ic power plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.

Jody:  But I’m using food that would otherwise be w asted.

Carl:  I hate to break it to you, but if you want t o convert food into fuel, there are already different types of biofuels that work prett y well.

Jody:  You mean somebody has already beaten me to t he punch?

Carl:  Yes, and I bet they’ve found a way to do it without this stench!

 Carl begins by saying, “Uh! What’s that smell?” – w hat is that smell? Jody says, “I’m working on my latest invention.” An “invention ” (invention) is something that you create, that no one else has made before, somet hing you make that solves some problem or does something that no one else has  been able to do before. We might talk about the invention of the television  or the invention of the Internet. Jody is working on an invention – her “latest,” mea ning her most recent invention. She says, “I’m turning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.” Jody is “turning” their old food “into” som ething, meaning she’s changing it. “To turn something into something else” is to t ransform it, to change it. She’s taking their old food and making it into an energy source. An energy source is a way of getting or obtaining energy needed to run so me machine or to power some technology.

Jody is trying to create an energy source for their  car and their house. Carl says, “Why? There are already lots of types of renewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!” The word “renewable” (renewable) is something you can use again or something that will not run out. “Renewable energy” is energy that comes from some natural reso urce that will never run out, or would take a very long time to use up, like the energy of the sun, for example, or water energy or wind energy. These might all be called “renewable energy sources.”

Carl says “There are lots of renewable energy sourc es and none of them smell like this,” meaning none of them smell like Jody’s invention of using old food. Jody responds, “Well, I think I’m onto a better alt ernative.” “To be onto something” means I’ve discovered, I’ve found. An “a lternative” would be something you can use instead of, or in place of so mething else.

A bicycle is an alternative to your car – if you’re  travelling short distances, that is. It’s an alternative to your  car, perhaps, not my car! I still want to drive my  car. I’m not against using a bicycle, of course – every coup le of years.

Jody says, “I’m onto a better alternative. Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel.” “To recycle” (recycle) me ans to take something that has been used already for a purpose and to use it again , often by cutting it up or breaking it up in some way and then re-using – usin g again – the material from that object, from that thing. Jody is saying that s he can recycle unwanted fuel and turn it into fuel. “Fuel” (fuel) here really me ans the same as “energy.” Often we think of fuel as something that is burned in ord er to produce energy, but it could be used more generally to mean an energy sour ce.

Jody says, “That’s the wave of the future.” That ex pression “the wave (wave) of the future” means something that will become very p opular or something that will be normal in the future, not right now but someday soon. We use the word “wave” just like an ocean wave, which is water that  moves up and travels across a certain distance or seems to travel – the water i s pushed, of course. We use that idea of a wave in talking about how things wil l go into the future – they will be moving into the future in this direction. We might say, “The wave of the future is using mobile devices – telephones and tablets, iPad s, that sort of thing – instead of computers sitting on your desk.” That might be a  “wave of the future.”

Carl says, “You mean you think that it would be mor e efficient than wind power and solar energy?”  “Efficient” means it does somet hing in a smaller amount of time or that uses less money or fewer resources. “W ind energy,” or “wind power” as it’s called here, is the power or energy created  by the wind, usually using some large piece of metal that moves around in a ci rcle. We would call that a “windmill” (windmill). “Solar energy” is using ener gy from the sun, either to heat up water or to create electricity. In some parts of  the United States where there’s a lot of sun throughout the year, people have “sola r panels” – large pieces of material on their roofs in order to collect solare nergy.

Carl goes on to mention a couple of other types of renewable energy sources. He says, “There are geothermal and hydroelectric power  plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.” “Geotherm al” (geothermal) refers to energy that you get from under the earth – from ins ide the ground, from a very hot area inside the ground. You are using that ener gy underground.

“Hydroelectric” refers to water that goes through a  small area called a “dam” and the pressure or power of the water turns engines, t urns these large pieces of metal – these wheels – which help create electricit y, combining them with the use of magnetic force, typically, I believe.

Jody says, “But I’m using food that would otherwise  be wasted,” meaning I’m using food that people are just going to throw away  or destroy. Carl says, “I hate to break it to you, but if you want to convert food  into fuel, there are already different types of biofuels that work pretty well.”  So, Carl is basically saying, “You’re kind of an idiot, Jody. We’ve already done these things.”

The expression “I hate to break (break) it to you” means “I don’t like to give you bad news but I’m going to tell you some bad news.” You might say to someone, “I hate to break it to you but you didn’t get the j ob. You were not hired.” You’re telling them news they don’t want to hear – bad new s. Carl says, “I hate to break it to you, but if you want to convert” – or change – “food into fuel” – or energy –

“there are already different types of biofuels that  work pretty well.” A “biofuel” (biofuel) is a fuel that is made from plants and an imals. It’s a kind of fuel that you can burn, typically, to create energy.

Jody says, “You mean somebody has already beaten me  to the punch?” “To beat someone to the punch (punch)” means to do something  before another person has the opportunity to do it.

So, you and your sister are thinking about buying y our mother a new set of dishes – something or her kitchen. You talk about i t and then your sister goes out and she buys the dishes for your mother and gives t hem to her, and you find out after talking to your mother that your sister gave her the dishes that you were going to give to her. So, you might say to your sis ter, “Oh, you beat me to the punch.” You did it before I had an opportunity to d o so. And now you’re mad at your sister because you don’t know what to get your  mother, because, you know, your mother is sometimes difficult to buy for. And so, when you have a good idea and your sister takes it, or your sister does it be fore you, you’re not very happy with your sister. I’m just speaking hypothetically.  This didn’t actually happen to me, of course.

So, Jody says, “You mean someone” – or somebody – “ has already beaten me to the punch?” Carl says, “Yes and I bet they found  a way to do it without this stench.” “Stench” (stench) is a very bad smell, a v ery unpleasant smell. Carl is saying that he thinks they have been able to do wha t Jody is trying to do without all of the bad smell.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.

Her scripts are the most important energy source th at powers this podcast. I speak, of course, of the one, the only, Dr. Lucy Ts e.
