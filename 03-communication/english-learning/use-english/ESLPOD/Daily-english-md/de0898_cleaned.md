[start of dialog] 

Gloria:  I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.   

Andy:  Oh, yeah?  I hadn’t noticed. 

Gloria:  Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks  with these people so I thought I’d get to know some of them. 

Andy:  That’s nice. 

Gloria:  Did you see that thirty-something couple w ith a toddler and an infant? I’m really surprised they’re on this tour. 

Andy:  I’m sure they know what they’re doing.   

Gloria:  And how about that group of seniors?  Some  of them look like they’re in the mid- to late-seventies. 

Andy:  They seem pretty spry to me. 

Gloria:  But what really surprises me is that group  of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage children.  They’ll be a han dful. 

Andy:  They seemed pretty well behaved to me. 

Gloria:  And did you notice that woman in her early -forties and the forty-ish man each traveling alone?  She seemed nice, but he didn ’t seem too friendly. 

Andy:  Maybe he’s using his time to size up everybo dy like you are. 

Gloria:  Well, I wish there were more young adults in this group.  I like talking to young people.  

Andy:  I think there will be plenty of people for y ou to talk to these two weeks when you’re not sightseeing.   

Gloria:  Sightseeing?  Oh yeah, sightseeing.

Gloria says, “I'm surprised at the variety of peopl e on this tour.” “Variety” just means many different kinds of people. Andy says, “O h yeah? I hadn't noticed.” I didn't realize. Gloria said, “Well, we’ll be spendi ng the next two weeks with these people so I thought I'd get to know some of them.” Gloria and Andy are on some sort of tour, probably of a different city or a dif ferent state, maybe even a different country. They're getting to know the people who are  in the same tour group. Gloria says she is getting to know them and Andy sa ys, “That's nice.” Andy doesn't seem very interested, does he?  

Gloria says, “Did you see that thirty-something cou ple with a toddler and an infant? I'm really surprised they’re on this tour.”  “Thirty-something” spelled (thirty- something) is an expression meaning someone who's i n their thirties. They could be 30, 31, 32, 33 all the way up to 39. That would be a thirty-something. If you are in your 20’s, you would be a twenty-something. If you are in your fifties, you would be a fifty-something and so forth. When you d on't know someone's exact age, but you think they're in their twenties or thi rties or forties, you can use this expression. “Toddler” (toddler) describes a young c hild, usually one, two, maybe three years old, who has recently learned to walk. A toddler is a young child but one who can walk. An “infant” (infant) is the same as a baby. This is someone who is not able to walk. “Infants” have to be carri ed from one place to another or maybe they can crawl on their hands and knees to mo ve themselves back and forth.  

Gloria says she’s surprised to see the thirty-somet hing couple with a toddler and an infant on the tour. Andy says, “I'm sure they kn ow what they're doing,” meaning the parents know what they're doing so we s houldn't worry about it. I think Andy is also kind of saying to Gloria here, i f I may interpret the script for you, that perhaps Gloria is too interested in these  other people. Gloria might be someone who we would describe as “nosy” (nosy). Som eone who's nosy is always trying to find out what's going on in other people's lives, trying to find  

things that are really not their concern, things th at are, we would say, none of their business.  

Gloria says, “And how about that group of seniors?”  “Seniors” (seniors) describes an old person, especially someone who is retired, w ho is no longer working. Gloria says, “Some of them look like they're in the ir mid to late seventies.” When we use the prefix mid (mid) followed by a hyphen, i n front of words like sixties, seventies or twenties, thirties, forties – any age,  we mean they’re in the middle of that range. To say someone's in their mid-seventies  means they're probably 74, 75, or 76. If you're in your mid-thirties, you're p robably 34, 35, 36. You can also describe ages using the prefix “late.” He's in his late eighties. That means he's probably 87, 88, or 89, and of course, you could al so say early. He's in his early forties. He's 40, 41, 42, maybe 43.  

Andy says that these seniors that Gloria is talking  about, “seem” or appear, “pretty” or very, “spry” to him. “To be spry” (spry ) means to have a lot of energy. It’s often used to describe an older person who has  perhaps a surprising amount of energy who’s more energetic than you may expect him to be. Gloria says, “But what really surprises me” – she continues to make o bservations – “is that group of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage  children. They'll be a handful.” “Middle-aged (middle-aged) means you are in the middle of your lifespan. Usually, we think of the ages between, sa y, 45 and 65 maybe 70 nowadays, as being middle-aged or between 50 and 70 . I have to say that because I'm not yet 50 so I don't want to consider myself middle-aged, but I probably am.  

Anyway, middle-aged would be people who are older b ut not retired – people who are probably still working in their 40’s, 50’s and 60’s. Gloria says that she's surprised that there is a group of middle-aged coup les, meaning usually husband and wife, with their tween and teenage children. “T eenage,” you probably know, is someone who is between the ages of 13 and 19 yea rs old. We call that person a teenager. The “teen” comes from the numbers thirt een, fourteen, fifteen and so forth. A “tween” (tween) is a newer word. It descri bes someone usually in the age bracket of nine to 12. Someone who isn't quite yet a teenager but they're not a child anymore, either. They’re not a young child. T hey're still children, of course. Nine to 12 is sometimes described now, in the last maybe 20 years or so as a tween.  

I think one of the reasons that word was invented w as for advertising and marketing reasons. They wanted a term that would co ver children who perhaps had enough influence on their parents to make them buy things so they decided to target them. They decided to advertise directly to them. That's, in any case,  

what a tween is – someone between the ages of nine and twelve. It could describe a boy or a girl but it's more often used t o describe girls. 

Gloria says that that these children will be a hand ful. When we say someone or something is a “handful,” we mean it's a lot of wor k. It's going to be difficult. It's going to be challenging. Once again Andy does not a gree with Gloria. That's how you know they're married. He says that the children  seem pretty well behaved to me. “Well-behaved” means that they are not acting i nappropriately. They're not yelling. They’re not screaming. They’re quiet; they ’re respectful – that would be well-behaved. We use that expression when talking a bout children or perhaps students.  

Andy doesn't agree with Gloria but Gloria continues  to go on and make her observations. She says, “And did you notice that wo man in her early forties and the forty-ish man, each traveling alone?” “Early fo rties,” we've already described. “Forty-ish” with the suffix (ish) at the end means approximately. This is an informal suffix that we put on words to indicate th at we’re not exactly sure. We’re saying it's kind of like that. You may ask, for exa mple, “Is it cold outside?” You could say, “Well it's cold–ish,” meaning it's sort of cold but it's not really cold or, “How hungry are you? Are you very hungry?” You can say, “Well I'm hungry-ish.” I'm not exactly starving, I'm not really hungry but  I'm a little hungry. This is very common now in conversational English - but informal  English, to be sure -  by adding “ish,” you are saying that you're not quite sure about something or you’re giving an approximate age in this case, when we say  forty-ish. 

Gloria says that “The woman seemed nice but the man  didn't seem too friendly.” She’s describing these two people who are traveling  by themselves. Andy says, “Maybe he's using his time to size up everybody lik e you are. The verb “to size (size) up” is a phrasal verb, meaning to evaluate o r assess something, usually just by looking at them. You size up a situation or  you size up a person. There's also an idea here that you're doing it rather quick ly and that you're doing it by comparing them to, perhaps, other people. So a boss  might size up the people who are applying for a job, decide, “Well, I like t hat person, and that person is better than that person but not as good as this per son.” That would be to size up. It could also mean to look at someone and decide wh at you think they’re like. You think that's a friendly person. You think that' s a mean person just by looking at them. That, of course, is not a very good idea.  

Gloria says, “Well, I wish there were more young ad ults in this group.” A “young adult” is a very general term to describe someone w ho's 18 years or older but usually younger than say, 30. Young adults tend to be 18, 19 – all the way up to 30, maybe even 35. I am no longer a young adult. Gl oria says, “I like talking to  

young people.” Andy says, “I think there will be pl enty of people for you to talk to these two weeks when you're not sightseeing.” “Sigh tseeing” is what you do on a tour. You go and you visit famous places – museums and parks and that sort of thing. Gloria says, “Sightseeing? Oh yeah, sightsee ing.” She's forgotten that, of course, the main reason you go on a tour is not to meet the other people in the tour but to see the places that you are going to vi sit. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.
