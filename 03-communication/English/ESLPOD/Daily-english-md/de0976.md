[start of dialogue] 

Romero: Are you going to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I? 

Alice: You’d better tell her. I don’t think she’s g oing to take it well. 

Romero: I’ll do it, but I’m not looking forward to it. She can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants. 

Alice: Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with h er. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines. I don’t know why they don’t f ire her. 

Romero: I think she’s just a little inexperienced. This is her first job, after all. Some of her behavior is pretty childish, but when s he’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about something, she does good work. 

Alice: That’s like saying somebody is a good worker  when they’re not napping! 

Romero: She’s not that bad, but we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our employees are so young.  

Alice: Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors selling to teenagers. 

Romero: I think that would open a whole different c an of worms!

Romero begins our dialogue by saying, “Are you goin g to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I?” Romer o is asking Alice if she is going to tell someone named Amber that she cannot h ave Saturday off of work. “To have a day off of work” means that you don’t ha ve to work that day. “I have Saturday off of work” means I do not have to work o n Saturday. Sometimes we just use the preposition “off” – “I have Saturday o ff.” That means I do not have to work on Saturday. Romero is asking Alice if she’s g oing to tell Amber that she cannot have Saturday off of work.  

Alice says, “You better tell her,” meaning you shou ld tell her, or it would be better that you told her. Alice says, “I don’t think she’s  going to take it well.” “To take something well” or “to take something very well” me ans to receive bad news calmly, without complaining. If someone tells you b ad news and you go, “Well, okay. I’m sorry to hear it. But that’s okay,” you a re taking the news calmly. Romero then says, “I’ll do it,” meaning I will tell  her, “but I’m not looking forward to it” – it’s not something I want to do. “She,” me aning Amber, “can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants.”  

“Mature” (mature) normally means acting like an adu lt. To describe someone as “mature” means that they act like an adult, not lik e a child. Mature can also mean old in some circumstances, but here we are using it  in the sense of someone who acts responsibly, acts like an adult. The oppos ite of mature would be “immature.” We often say that children and adolesce nts are “immature.” They’re not mature. They don’t act like an adult. They don’ t act responsibly sometimes.  

Alice says, “Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with her. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines.” Alice is describing Amb er here. She says that if things don’t go Amber’s way, “she pouts and whines. ” When we say something “goes your way” (way), we mean it happens in a way that you want it to happen. If you are hoping that a certain baseball team wins  the World Series, the championship, next year (say, for example, the Los Angeles Dodgers), and they win the championship – they win the World Series – then you can say, “Well, things went my way,” meaning they turned out or the y had the result that you wanted them to have.  

Alice says that if Amber doesn’t have things go her  way, “she pouts and whines.” “To pout” (pout) means physically to take your lowe r lip and put it down in a way that indicates that you are unhappy or sad. When so meone does that, especially a child, we would say they’re pouting. They’re feel ing perhaps sorry for themselves, and they’re trying to show other people  that they are unhappy. Normally, it’s something that a child does. An adul t could also “pout,” although  

they may not actually change the expression on thei r face to do so. “Pouting” is usually considered something that children do, and therefore an immature act.  

“To whine” (whine) means to make loud noises when y ou are complaining about something, when you don’t like something. You say t hings out loud that indicate that you don’t like the situation. We often associa te whining with a high-pitched voice: “Oh, I don’t want to go to the store, Dad.” That would be a little child whining. Once again, whining, like pouting, is cons idered immature – not something an adult should do. Well, we don’t want o ur children to do it either, but we can at least understand it if they do because th ey are not mature yet.  

Alice says, “I don’t know why they don’t fire her.”  “To fire” (fire) means to tell someone that they no longer work at the place where  they were working. “To fire” means to get rid of an employee. Romero says, “I th ink she’s just a little inexperienced.” “To be experienced” means to have a  long time working with a certain project or a certain kind of job. “To be in experienced” means to not have a lot of time doing that particular activity. Romer o thinks that Amber is inexperienced; she’s not experienced.  

He says, “This is her first job, after all. Some of  her behavior is pretty childish, but when she’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about s omething, she does good work.” “To be childish” (childish) means to act lik e a child, not like an adult. “To kick up a fuss” (fuss) means to do something or say  something to indicate that you are not happy with the situation – to complain about something in such a way that you are trying to bother other people, or you are trying to get them angry, perhaps.  

“To kick up a fuss” means to complain loudly in suc h a way that you are trying to cause what we might call a “scene” (scene). You’re trying to get other people to notice you. People “kick up a fuss” because they wa nt someone to do something the way they want it, and when the situation is suc h that things are not going their way, they do this sort of complaining in order to g et the person to do what they want them to do.  

“To moan” (moan) is similar to the verb “to whine.”  It means to complain, but instead of complaining in a high-pitched voice, “mo aning” usually refers to people who complain in a low voice. “Ah, I’m really angry.  I’m not happy” – that’s “to moan.” A “moan” can also be simply a sound that you  make when you are disappointed or upset about something. If your favo rite baseball team loses the World Series, you may go, “Ohh!” That is also “moan ing.” Here, it really just means “complaining.” Romero then describes Amber as  sometimes being  

“pretty” – or very – “childish.” “But when she’s no t kicking up a fuss or moaning” – when she’s not complaining – “she does good work,” Romero says.  

Alice says, “That’s like saying somebody is a good worker when they’re not napping.” “To nap” means to sleep for a short perio d of time during the day, when you wouldn’t normally be sleeping. Actually, many p eople say that napping in the afternoon for 30 minutes or an hour is actually goo d for you. You’re able to get more done. You have more energy in the late afterno ons and evenings if you do that. Alice is making a joke here. She’s saying tha t Romero’s description of Amber – as someone who does good work when she’s no t complaining – is like describing someone as a good worker when they’re no t sleeping.  

Romero says, “She’s not that bad,” meaning she’s no t really bad. “But we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our emp loyees are so young.” “To look past” something means not to pay attention to something so that you can focus on something more important. If someone is ma king small mistakes, but is overall doing a good job, we will probably look pas t his or her mistakes. We won’t worry about them because we know there’s something more important.  

“Juvenile” (juvenile) is normally used as a synonym  for “immature.” “Juvenile” describes someone who is not an adult. Usually, the  word is used when we’re talking about teenagers. As an adjective, it’s usua lly used to describe an immature action, and that’s how the dialogue is usi ng it here. Romero says that “we do have to look past some juvenile antics.” “An tics” (antics) are actions that are not appropriate – that are immature, in a way. “Juvenile antics,” then, would describe actions that are childish or that you woul d not expect of someone who was mature. 

Alice says, “Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors se lling to teenagers.” “Seniors” (seniors) are people who are old, people who usuall y are over the age of 65 or 70 – maybe 75 nowadays. As people live longer and l onger, the definition of “young” and “old” changes over time. I hope it keep s changing so I’m never old, but someday I will be a senior. “Teenagers” describ e people who are between the ages usually of 13 and 20.  

Romero says, “I think that would open a whole diffe rent can of worms!” Alice is suggesting that instead of having teenagers working  for them, they have seniors working for them. Romero thinks that there would be  other problems if that happened, and that’s why he uses the expression “op en a whole different can of worms” (worms). The expression “to open a can of wo rms” or “a whole new can of worms” means to start talking about and getting involved in a new problem.  

You already have one problem, and now you are going  to create a different kind of problem, and that’s what Romero is saying.  

Having seniors working for their company instead of  teenagers would not necessarily be a better thing, because it may creat e different kinds of problems, but still just as serious as the ones they’re havin g now. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
