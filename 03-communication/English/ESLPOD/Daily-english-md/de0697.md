This episode is called “Eating a School Lunch.”  It ’s a dialogue between Chris and Sybil related to kids – high school students; e lementary school students – eating lunch at their school.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chris:  What are you doing?  Let’s get into the hot  lunch line.

Sybil:  See this lunchbox?  My mom made me brown-ba g it today.  She says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enou gh.

Chris:  That sucks.  What did she make you?

Sybil:  A salad.

Chris:  Oh, gross.  I really feel sorry for you.  W hat else?

Sybil:  Let me see.  There are some carrot sticks, too.

Chris:  Sucker!  You should have thrown a fit.  I w ouldn’t have taken it lying down.  Listen to me.  You should ditch that lunch a nd buy lunch instead, like me.

Sybil:  I can’t.  I don’t have any lunch money.  Do  you want to trade some of yours for mine?

Chris:  You’re dreaming.  There’s no way I’m tradin g my pizza for your salad and carrot sticks.

Sybil:  Not even if I do your math homework?

Chris:  Math homework?  Now you’ve got my attention .

Sybil:  Only if you give me the entire slice of piz za.

Chris:  You drive a hard bargain.  How about this?  I’ll split the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.

Sybil:  You must really think I’m a sucker if you t hink I’d agree to that!

[end of dialogue]

Chris begins by saying to Sybil, “What are you doin g?  Let’s get into the hot lunch line.”  At most schools in the United States, the s chool gives students the opportunity – the option of buying their lunch, a h ot lunch cooked at the school. The school has a kitchen and a place where the stud ents can eat called a “cafeteria.”  My school, when I was growing up, did  not have a hot lunch program.  But this school, and most schools, do hav e them.

Chris says to Sybil, “Let’s get into the hot lunch line,” the line where people are waiting to get their food.  Sybil says, “See this l unchbox?  My mom made me brown-bag it today.”  A “lunchbox” is a small, usua lly metal or plastic box or container that put your food into.  When I was grow ing up, as I said, there was no hot lunch program so many kids, especially the smal ler children, had lunchboxes. These were metal; they often had pictures of cartoo ns or sports figures on them. I had one; I don’t remember what was on it.  But, l unchboxes were the way that you took your lunch to school.  The other way you c ould take your lunch is put it in a paper bag, a brown bag – I’m not sure why, but  the bags were always brown – and that is what Sybil is referring to.  In fact,  she’s using this as a verb; “to brown-bag it” means to bring your lunch – cold lunc h in a bag, not to buy lunch at school.

Sybil says her mother says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enough.  “Nutritious” (nutritious) is another word for healthy, food that has vitamins, minerals, other good things, and not too much sugar, fat, or salt – all the things that taste good!  That’s a nutritious lu nch or a nutritious meal, and Sybil’s mother says that the lunches at school are not nutritious.  This has actually been a common complaint or problem in the United States, especially in the last few years.  People have been saying that w e need to change the lunch programs in our schools so that they serve more nut ritious food, because all the American kids are getting fat.  Well, maybe because  they are sitting at home playing video games.  Maybe it’s because their pare nts don’t let them go out

anymore on a bicycle unless they have the latest sa fety equipment on their head. I don’t know, but they are getting fatter.

Chris says, “That sucks.”  The expression “that suc ks” means that’s very bad or that’s very disappointing.  It’s a very informal te rm used by a lot of young people, not something you want to say to your boss, and it means that it’s very unfortunate or very sad.  Chris says, “What did she  (your mother) make you?” Sybil says, “A salad.”  Chris says, “Oh, gross.”  “ Gross” means disgusting, something that is very unpleasant, usually related to food but not always. Another informal term we might use is “yuck” or “yu cky.”  That’s the general idea. Chris says, “I really feel sorry for you.  What els e?” meaning what else did she make.  Sybil says, “Let me see.  There are some car rot sticks, too,” little carrots that are cut up.

Chris says, “Sucker!”  “Sucker” is a rude word used  to describe someone who has been tricked or manipulated or used by another person.  It’s definitely a negative description of someone; it’s saying that p erson is stupid, in a way, for being deceived, for being used or tricked.  Chris s ays, “You should have thrown a fit.”  “To throw a fit” means to get very angry, to  start yelling and screaming; it’s something you expect a little child to do.  In fact , when a child does it it’s sometimes called also a “temper tantrum.”  Chris sa ys, “I wouldn’t have taken it lying down.”  “To take (something) lying down” mean s to accept something without opposing or protesting it even though you’r e not very happy.  You don’t say anything, you just accept it.  That’s to take s omething lying down.  Chris says, “Listen to me.  You should ditch that lunch a nd buy lunch instead, like me,” like I am going to do.  “To ditch” (ditch) here mea ns to get rid of something, to throw something away.  “I’m going to ditch my old b oxes in the garage,” I’m going to throw them away.  We also use this verb in schoo ls, especially, to mean not to go to class when you are supposed to.  “I’m going t o ditch my chemistry class today,” I’m not going to go.  That’s what we used t o say, and that’s probably something I did when I was in school – ditch chemis try class, that is.  Not my favorite subject, if I’m being completely honest.

Chris says that Sybil should ditch her lunch, shoul d throw it away and buy lunch instead.  Sybil says, “I can’t.  I don’t have any l unch money,” any money you can use to buy lunch, of course.  She says, “Do you wan t to trade some of yours for mine?”  “To trade” means I give you something and y ou give me something else; we exchange it.  Chris responds by saying, “You’re dreaming.”  The expression “you’re dreaming” is an informal way of saying that  what the person just said or just suggested is completely unacceptable or silly.   It’s another way of saying “no way, absolutely not.”  “You’re dreaming.  There’s no way I’m trading my pizza for

your salad and carrot sticks.”  So, Chris isn’t going to give Sybil some pizza in order to get some salad and carrot sticks.

Then, Sybil tries to convince Chris to trade with h er.  She says, “Not even if I do your math homework?”  Sybil is offering to do Chris ’s math “homework,” what the teacher gave them as work to do at home, in exchang e for some of his pizza. Chris says, “Math homework?  Now you’ve got my atte ntion,” meaning okay, maybe this is something I will do; I’m now paying a ttention.  Sybil says, “Only if you give me the entire slice of pizza.”  A “slice” is a piece of something, a piece of food typically, cut from a larger portion or pie ce of food.  We use “slice” when we’re talking about bread; we use it when we’re tal king about cakes; we use it when we’re talking about pies, cheese, and sometime s meat.  “I want a slice of turkey on my sandwich, with a slice of cheese, on t wo slices of white bread.  For dessert, I’m going to have a slice of pie and two s lices of cake.”  Of course, here we’re talking about pizza, which is also a type of food we use this word “slice” (slice) with.

Chris says, “You drive a hard bargain.”  “To drive a hard bargain” means that you are good at negotiating something; you get a lot of  things when you negotiate, when you are trading with someone, when you are try ing to get someone to agree with you.  He says, “How about this?  I’ll sp lit the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.”  Chris is saying, “Well, I don’t want  to give you the entire slice of pizza; I’ll give you half of that.”  That’s what he  means by saying, “I’ll split the pizza with you.”  “To split” means to share it, eac h person gets half of it or some part of it.  “Split” has a couple of other meanings  in English; take a look at the wonderful Learning Guide for some more information.

Sybil then says, “You must really think I’m a sucke r if you think I’d agree to that!” She’s saying here that Chris must think she is stup id, that she’s a sucker, if he thinks that she will do his homework for only half a slice of pizza.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Chris:  What are you doing?  Let’s get into the hot  lunch line.

Sybil:  See this lunchbox?  My mom made me brown-ba g it today.  She says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enou gh.
