This episode is called “Having Breathing Problems,”  a dialogue between Russ and Cheryl with a vocabulary related to “breathing”  – putting air into your lungs and breathing out again. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Russ: Why are you wheezing like that? 

Cheryl: I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little short o f breath. My lungs feel like they’ve closed up. 

Russ: Maybe you should get that checked out. You co uld have asthma.  

Cheryl: Do you really think so? My nasal passages h ave been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold. My sinuses hurt, too . 

Russ: I’m not a doctor, but you may have something more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something. 

Cheryl: Wow, so this could be something really seri ous? 

Russ: Why do you sound hopeful that you have a seri ous condition? 

Cheryl: I’m not. That would be stupid. 

Russ: And yet, you sounded positively giddy that yo u might be laid up for a couple of weeks. Does this have anything to do with  your upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?   

 Cheryl: If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?

Our dialogue begins with Russ saying to Cheryl, “Wh y are you wheezing like that?” “To wheeze” (wheeze) means to make a loud so und while breathing, usually because you’re having problems breathing – perhaps you’re not getting enough oxygen into your lungs. “To wheeze” is to [w heezing]. That could be an example of wheezing.  

Cheryl says, “I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little s hort of breath.” “To be short of breath” (breath) means that you have to breathe qui ckly in order to get enough oxygen into your lungs. Usually we are short of bre ath when we are doing a lot of physical activity or we’re running up a set of stai rs. You might become short of breath. You might have a little bit of difficulty b reathing, especially if you’re not used to doing a lot of physical activity. 

Cheryl says, “My lungs feel like they’ve closed up. ” Your “lungs” (lungs) are the organs in your body, the parts of your body, that b ring in air and “expel” air, we would say, when you “inhale” (inhale) – when you pu t air into your lungs – and then you “exhale” (exhale) – when the air goes out of your lungs, when it is pushed out of your lungs. Cheryl says her lungs “fe el like they’ve closed up.” “To close up” normally means to no longer be open, but here it probably means something more like not having enough room to move or to expand.  

Russ says, “Maybe you should get that checked out.”  “To get something checked (checked) out” means to have something looked at, i nvestigated. The phrasal verb “to check out” means to look at, to investigat e. We use the phrase “to get something checked out” typically when we’re talking  about some sort of medical issue – say, you have a hand that is been bothering  you, it hurts. Someone may say to you, “You should get that checked out,” mean ing you should go to a doctor or a nurse and have them look at it and make sure t here’s nothing wrong with you.  

Russ says, “You could have asthma.” “Asthma” (asthm a) is a medical condition that makes it very difficult for people to breathe properly and easily. My older brothers had asthma and my father had asthma, quite  a serious case of asthma, actually. Cheryl says, “Do you really think so? My nasal passages have been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold.” Th e word “nasal” (nasal) refers to  

your nose. A “passage” is an area where something m oves in and out of, or goes through.  

So, your “nasal passages” are the parts of your nos e where the air goes in and out, where you breathe in – you inhale – and you br eathe out – you exhale. Of course, you can also breathe in and breathe out wit h your mouth, but the nasal passages refer specifically to your nose.  

Cheryl says her nasal passages have been “stopped u p.” “To be stopped up” means that there is something blocking the passage so that things cannot move through easily or at all. You could also talk about , say, the pipes that are connected to your sink as being “stopped up.” If yo u put a bunch of food down into the pipes that drain the water from your sink,  the pipe might become stopped up.  

When we’re talking about pipes and sinks and toilet s, we actually use another verb more typically, which is “clogged” (clogged). “To be clogged up” means the same as to be stopped up. What’s supposed to move t hrough this area, this passage, is not able to because something is stoppi ng it. That’s the problem that Cheryl has with her nasal passages. She’s not able to breathe easily or at all through her nose because her nasal passages have be en stopped up.  

She continues, “My sinuses hurt, too.” Your “sinuse s” (sinuses) are open areas inside the bones of your face that are connected to  your nasal passages. So, it’s part of your “breathing system,” you might call it.  People often have problems with their sinuses. Sometimes your sinuses can get an infection so that they hurt, sometimes quite a lot. I’ve had a sinus infection m yself. It’s very painful. But enough about me, back to Cheryl and Russ.  

Russ says, “I’m not a doctor but you may have somet hing more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something.” Russ says he’s not a doctor, but he thinks that Cheryl might have a more serious illness or problem with her body. He says that she may have “b ronchitis” (bronchitis). Bronchitis is a condition where you have typically an infection of the tubes, the passages, that lead into the lungs. Usually it caus es coughing and difficulty breathing and can be quite serious. You need to go to a doctor to get medicine if you have bronchitis, usually.  

Russ says that Cheryl might also have pneumonia. “P neumonia” (pneumonia) – notice the “p” is silent; we don’t pronounce it – i s also an infection related to your lungs. When you have pneumonia, your lungs often fi ll with a fluid, a liquid, which  

makes it difficult to breathe. A pneumonia can also  be quite serious. In fact, you can die from pneumonia.  

Russ tells Cheryl that she needs a “chest x-ray.” Y our “chest” (chest) is the upper part of your body where your lungs are located, as well as your heart and a few other things. An “x-ray” is a special photograph th at they take of the inside of your body. So, a “chest x-ray” would be one of thes e special photographs. Usually you get a chest x-ray when the doctor think s there might be something more seriously wrong with your lungs or your breath ing.  

Cheryl is surprised. She says, “Wow! So this could be something really serious?” Russ says, “Why do you sound hopeful that you have a serious condition?” Russ is a little confused by Cheryl’s reaction. It almos t seems as if Cheryl wanted to be sick. Cheryl says, “I’m not. That would be stupid.”   

Russ says, “And yet, you sounded positively giddy t hat you might be laid up for a couple of weeks.” “Giddy” (giddy) means very happy,  very excited, almost out of control with excitement. “Positively” here means co mpletely, thoroughly, entirely. “Positively giddy,” then, means you are very excite d. You are completely excited, very happy about something. Russ thinks that Cheryl  is happy about being “laid up.” “To be laid (laid) up” means to be forced to s tay in bed, usually because you are sick or have some illness.  

Russ says, “Does this have anything to do with your  upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?” “Upcoming” means happening soon in t he future. We might also use the word “approaching.” It’s something that’s g oing to be happening soon – maybe in a day, maybe in a week, maybe in a month.  

Cheryl says, “If you had to go to Abrahamville, wou ldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?” “Abrahamville” is, of course, not a real place, but it’s obviously a place where Cheryl does not want to go. That’s why she as ks Russ, “If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too?” A n “out” (out) here means a reason or an excuse for not doing something. Cheryl  is looking for a reason not to go to Abrahamville. She’s looking for an “out.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
