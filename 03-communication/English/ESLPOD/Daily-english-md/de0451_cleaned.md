This episode is called “Buying Car Insurance.”  It’s a dial ogue between Jackie and an “agent,” someone who sells insurance for cars.  In it, we’ll use a lot of common vocabulary in talking about cars and car insurance.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Agent:  Hello, Krashit Insurance. 

Jackie:  Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance. 

Agent:  Sure, I can help you with that.  I assume you wa nt liability insurance, but what other coverage would you like to get? 

Jackie:  Umm…I’m not sure.  This is my first car. 

Agent:  In that case, let me make a few suggestions.  You ’ll definitely want collision insurance.  It pays to fix your car if you hit ano ther car or run into something. 

Jackie:  Okay, sure, I want that. 

Agent:  You’ll also want comprehensive insurance.  It pa ys for damage to your car. 

Jackie:  How’s it different from collision insurance?   

Agent:  Well, it pays for damage to your car that’s not a result of an accident, like in the case of theft, weather damage, or vandalism.  

 Jackie:  Okay, I want that, too. 

Agent:  You’ll want property damage insurance to pay f or damage you cause to someone else’s property.  On top of that, you’ll want un insured motorist insurance in case the other driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car. 

Jackie:  Umm…I guess I’ll take that, too. 

Agent:  And I don’t think you can do without medical pa yments insurance.  It pays for your medical bills and those of your passengers in case  of an accident. Should I get you a quote for all of this coverage? 

Jackie:  Why don’t you hold off on that?  I’m not sure h ow I’m going to pay for all that and buy gas, too!

This is a telephone conversation between a car insurance  agent, a person who sells car insurance, and Jackie.  The agent answers the phone : “Hello, Krashit Insurance.”  Jackie says, “Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance.”  A “quote” is an estimate, an approximate cost of something , how much something will cost me.  So if you take your car to a mechanic to ge t it fixed, you may ask for an estimate – a quote on how much the repairs wi ll be.  Or if you are having someone come to your house and paint the walls, you woul d first ask for a quote – how much money will it be.  It’s an estimate of the cost of something.  “Quote” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so take a look at Learning Guide for a complete explanation. 

Jackie says she wants a quote for car insurance.  “Insurance” is basically an arrangement where you give money to a company, and if you  have an accident or a problem the company will pay for the repair of th at accident or that problem, depending on what it is. 

So, the agent says, “Sure, I can help you with that” – I can give you a quote.  He says, “I assume you want liability insurance.”  “I assume” mea ns I believe that something is true; I am going to believe that it is tru e unless you tell it isn’t.  In the United States, there are a couple of different kinds of car insurance, and usually you are required to have certain kinds of insurance, it d epends on the state where you live.  Liability insurance is one kind of insuran ce.  “Liability” comes from word “liable,” which means to be responsible for something.  There are two  

 basic kinds of liability insurance.  One kind is to “cover” you, to pay for any problems you cause to somebody’s health or to a person’s body.  This is sometimes called “bodily liability.”  If, for example, b roke someone’s legs or even killed them, liability insurance would pay them some mo ney, or if they’re dead, of course, their relatives.  That’s one kind of liability insu rance, “bodily injury” it’s sometimes called.  The other kind is if you damage someon e else’s car or someone else’s property, that’s called “property damage” i nsurance; it’s a different kind of liability insurance. 

The agent says, “what other coverage would you like to g et?”  “Coverage” are the things that the insurance policy will pay for, will prote ct you against.  So here in California, for example, in Southern California we h ave a lot of earthquakes, where the ground moves suddenly.  You can buy special earth quake insurance for your house; you can also buy fire insurance for your ho use.  Each kind of insurance is different.  The same is true for a car; ther e are different kinds of insurance, the things that the insurance protects is called the coverage.   

Well, Jackie says she’s not sure, this is her first car.  The ag ent says, “In that case (in that situation), let me make a few suggestions.  He says, “You definitely want collision insurance.”  “Collision” means two things h it each other, two cars, for example, run into each other; that would be a coll ision.  “Collision insurance” is money that the insurance company will give you if your car is damaged.  That is, it doesn’t pay for the other person’s car; it pays for  your car.  Most states do not require that you have collision insurance, but it’s often a good idea.  The agent explains that collision insurance pays to fix your car  if you hit another car or run into something.  To “run into” means to hit so mething else, especially when you are driving.  Generally, that is not a good id ea! 

Jackie says, “Okay, sure, I want that.”  Then the agent says, “You’ll also want comprehensive insurance.  It pays for damage to your car.”  “Damage” is physical harm that comes to something.  If you take water and you pour it onto your laptop, as I did once, that will damage your compu ter; it will cause damage. The word can be both a noun and a verb. 

Jackie says, “How is (comprehensive insurance) different from co llision insurance?”  The agent explains that comprehensive insuran ce pays for damage to your car that is not the result of an accident – it i s not because of an accident. An “accident” is, in this case, the same as a collision o r a crash, when your car hits something else.  Comprehensive insurance pays for thi ngs in addition to accidents, for example in the case of theft.  “In the case of (something)” means if something happens in a particular situation.  “Theft” i s when someone steals something from you – steals your car, in this case.  Compre hensive insurance  

 will pay for your car if someone steals it.  Comprehensive  insurance will also pay for “weather damage,” if you have bad weather and th at damages your car.  It will also pay if you are a victim of vandalism.  A “victim” is so meone who is hurt by someone else or something.  “Vandalism” means someone tr ies to damage your property by throwing something on it or by doing somethi ng that would cause it to be harmed in some way.  They may, for example, paint on it or take a rock and throw it at it, that would be an example of vandalism .  If you don’t have comprehensive insurance and your car is vandalized or stolen, you won’t get any money for it.  I discovered this when I had a car many ye ars ago here in Los Angeles, and it was stolen.  I later discovered that I d id not have comprehensive insurance, and so I didn’t get any money from the insuran ce company. 

Jackie says, “Okay, I want that, too.”  The agent says, “You’ ll want property damage insurance to pay for damage you cause to someone else’s property.” We already talked about liability insurance, which pays for  damage you do to someone else or something else.  This is a type of liabi lity insurance: property damage insurance.  The agent says, “On top of that (mea ning in addition to that), you’ll want uninsured motorist insurance in case the other  driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car” – if they hit you, and they are the ones who are responsibl e.  So, “uninsured” means not insured.  Even though the law in most states re quires that all drivers have insurance, sometimes people don’t do that – they do n’t buy the insurance. And, of course, if the other person hits you and it’s th eir fault, their insurance should pay for the damages done to your car.  But if th ey don’t have any insurance, then you can use your own uninsured motorist i nsurance.  A “motorist” is just another name for a person who drives a car. 

Jackie says, “Umm…I guess I’ll take that, too.”  Of course, the  insurance agent is trying to sell her as much insurance as possible.  The ag ent says, “And I don’t think you can do without medical payments insurance.”  The  expression “can’t do without” means that you must have something.  “Medical payments insurance” is money that is paid for your medical expenses and for the o ther people who may have been in your car if there is an accident and they are  injured, if they break their leg or their arm for example.   

The agent says, “It pays for your medical bills and those o f your passengers (the other people in the car) in case of an accident.  Shoul d I get you a quote for all of this coverage?”  Jackie says, “Why don’t you hold off on tha t?”  To “hold off on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to wait to do som ething, to delay something.  So, Jackie’s saying no, I don’t want a quote r ight now, let’s do that later.  “I’m not sure how I’m going to pay for all t hat and buy gas, too!”  She  

 doesn’t know if she’ll have the money to pay for all of these different kinds of insurance.   

As I said previously, in most states there’s a minimum amou nt of insurance that you must have, but it doesn’t necessarily mean all of thes e kinds of insurance. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
