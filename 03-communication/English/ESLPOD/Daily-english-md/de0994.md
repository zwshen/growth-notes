[start of dialogue]

Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?

Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.

Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.

Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.

Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye t hree times already.

Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighbor hood of the bullseye.

Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’ m hitting wide of the mark every time!

Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.

Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.

Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.

The topic of this episode is describing accuracy an d inaccuracy. “Accuracy” (accuracy) can refer to whether something is true o r correct. “Accuracy” is also used sometimes to refer to precision – whether some thing that you are trying to accomplish is done not only correctly, but precisel y; that you are able, for example, to throw something and hit what you are tr ying to hit. If you hit it, you are being accurate. You are, in a sense, accomplish ing what you are trying to accomplish. We see the latter use of that term “acc uracy” in this dialogue. “Inaccuracy,” of course, would mean not accurate.

Rona starts by saying, “This is impossible. I’m nev er going to hit the target.” A “target” (target) is a person or thing that you are  trying to hit. That’s why we are talking about accuracy in this dialogue, because we ’re talking about trying to hit something for sport, as in part of a game. This is the sport of “archery” (archery). “Archery” is using what’s called a “bow” and “arrow ” to hit a target.

The “bow” is usually a piece of metal or wood that has a string attached on the top and the bottom. You put a long, narrow piece of  wood or metal in the string, and you pull the string back in order to shoot it. That long narrow thing is called the “arrow” (arrow). Archery is a sport that uses b ows and arrows. In this dialogue, Rona asks, “Why is it I’m the only one in  this archery class who has no aim?” She’s trying to make the arrow hit the target , but she says she has “no aim” (aim). “Aim” here is the ability to direct som ething such as an arrow so that it will hit your target.

Usually in archery the target is a series of circle s, and you’re supposed to hit the middle circle in the center, and that is your goal.  Rona says she doesn’t have very good aim. She isn’t able to direct the arrow s o that it hits the target properly. Leonardo says, however, “You’re doing fine. I can t ell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.” “Precision ” (precision) is being able to be exact. Here, it’s just another word for accuracy .

Rona says, “But you seem to be picking it up quickl y.” “To pick something up” is a phrasal verb which here means to learn how to do something. You can also pick something up literally, with your hand – you c an put your hand down and pick up a pen, for example – but in this case, it m eans to learn something quickly.

Leonardo says, “I’m taking this class as a refreshe r.” A “refresher” is when you do something that you already have learned how to d o, but need to be reminded again. You need to practice, perhaps, this skill so me more. A refresher would be a class you take to remind you how to do the things  you’ve already learned how

to do. Leonardo says, “My father taught me the rudi ments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.” The  “rudiments” (rudiments) of something are the basics of something, the basic sk ills to do something.

“To take something up” is to learn how to do someth ing, to begin to learn how to do something. “To take up playing the piano,” for e xample, would be to learn how to play the piano, to start learning how to play the piano. So, “to take up” something is to start learning how to do something.  “To pick up something quickly” is to learn something quickly. “To take up ” emphasizes the fact that you’re just beginning to learn something, that you are starting to learn it.

Rona says to Leonardo, “You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.” A “bullseye” (bullseye) is the center of the target. Remember, I was talking about how targets in archery are usually ci rcles, what we would call “concentric circles” – circles that go around other  circles. Well, the center circle is the “bullseye.” Leonardo says, “I’m using a much mo re forgiving bow than you are.” The word “forgiving” here means that you can make more mistakes with it and it will still work okay; it will function prope rly even though you’re not great at using it.

Leonardo says, “If I aim for the target” – if I try  to shoot at the target – “I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bu llseye.” “In the neighborhood of” here means close to – not exactly on the target , not exactly where you want it to go, but close to there. Rona says, “You’re just trying to make me feel better” – you’re just trying to make me happier because I’m n ot very good at this.

She says, “I’m hitting wide of the mark every time. ” The phrase “wide (wide) of the mark (mark)” means not close to where you are s upposed to be, in this case, shooting the arrow. So, hitting it “wide of the mar k” means not being very close at all. Leonardo says, “I think your arms are too tens e and that tension is ruining your accuracy.” If you describe someone’s arms and legs as “tense” (tense), you mean that they’re very tight. Tense is the opposite  of relaxed. “Accuracy,” we’ve already discussed, is precision.

Leonardo then offers to help Rona, and Rona says, “ Watch out,” meaning be careful. “With my aim, I could take you out.” Rona is making a joke here. “To take someone out” here means to kill someone, to end som eone’s life. Rona says, “With my aim” – since I’m such a bad shot, since I’ m such a bad archer – I could kill you just by shooting my arrow. By accident, of  course.

Leonardo, of course, is interested in Rona. He’s in terested, in fact, in taking Rona out, but not in killing her – in taking her on a da te. That’s interesting. I’ve never

thought about the fact that we use that phrasal ver b “to take out” to mean both to take someone on a romantic date and to kill someone . Interesting. There might be some relationship there. I don’t know.

Leonardo says at the end, “I’ll take my chances.” H e again is joking. He says, “I’ll take my chances,” meaning I will do this even if it  is risky and dangerous, because I want to help you – because, of course, he  likes her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
