# Understanding Men and Women

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 41 – Understanding Men and Women.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 41. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss relationshi ps. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: Jeff, here's a question. I was just talking to Dawn. You know, they had their first wedding anniversary last week. Guess what her  husband gave her as a present.

Jeff: I don't know. What?

Lucy: He gave her a vacuum cleaner.

Jeff: Didn't she want a vacuum cleaner?

Lucy: Yes, the old one was broken, but that's not the point! It was their wedding anniversary, their first one. Dawn was really upset  that he wasn't more romantic. He really let her down.

Jeff: Oh, great. Women are always saying that men a ren't romantic. But we are! Just not in the way that women want.

Lucy: What do you mean?

Jeff: It's a man's job to protect his wife and fami ly. When something goes wrong, they want to fix it. That's the mark of a good husb and.

Lucy: I can see that, but that's not romantic in my  book.

Jeff: That's because you women have this idealized view of romance that you get from a lifetime of watching chick flicks and readin g romance novels. Even if a man wanted to, he could never get into the head of a woman and guess what she wanted. That's why women have to just tell us w hat they want.

Lucy: That's the problem. We women think men should  just know what we want, without us having to tell them; that is, if the man  really loved and understood us. That's why we don't want to tell you. But I see you r point, too.

Jeff: So, I guess it's really true. Men are from Ma rs and women are from Venus.

Lucy: Yeah, that's what makes life interesting, rig ht?

In this episode, Lucy and I talked about men and wo men and how they understand or misunderstand each other – that is, n ot understand each other. Lucy began by saying, “Jeff, here's a question.” Th at expression “Here’s a question” means “I want to ask you a question.” It' s a way of introducing – we might say “prefacing” – a question. It's letting the other person know that you are going to ask them a question. Lucy said that she “w as just talking to Dawn.” She was recently talking to Dawn. When we say we are “j ust doing” something, we were recently, or right before this, doing somethin g.

She said that Dawn and her husband were having thei r first “wedding anniversary.” “Wedding” (wedding) is, of course, wh en people get married, and “anniversary” is when you celebrate every year, usu ally on that same day. So, if you get married on May first, you celebrate each an niversary on May first in the following years. My parents were married on May fir st. Lucy explained that Dawn's husband gave her a vacuum cleaner for their first wedding anniversary. A “vacuum (vacuum) cleaner” is what you use to get di rt out of a carpet or a rug. Usually, it's electric. The vacuum cleaner, Lucy th ought, is not a good gift for a wedding anniversary. Hmm, that's funny.

I asked Lucy if Dawn wanted one, and Lucy responded , or said in reply to me, “That's not the point.” “That's not the point” mean s that's not what's important. That's not what she meant. That wasn't what I was t hinking of. The “point” (point) of something is either the reason for something or the meaning of something. We often say, “The point is, I want you to do somethin g,” such as go to the store, meaning “What I'm really trying to say is” or “What  I really mean is this.”

Lucy said that her friend Dawn “was really upset.” “To be upset” (upset) means to be angry, to be mad, to be bothered by something. S he was upset because her husband “wasn't more romantic.” “To be romantic” (r omantic) means to be loving of your husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend. “R omance” refers to a love between two people. I, for example, am very romanti c with my wife, but just don't ask her about that.

 Anyway, Lucy said that Dawn's husband “really let h er down.” “To let someone down” is a phrasal verb that means to disappoint th em, to do something that they didn't or don't like. They were expecting one thing  and you did something else. For example, I was supposed to meet my friend last night at 6:00 p.m., but I forgot about it. I let down my friend, or I let my friend down. In either case, it means I didn't do what I was supposed to do or what  he expected me to do.

I then used the expression, “Oh, great.” “To be gre at” usually means to be very good, to be wonderful, to be the best. But when we use an expression with that sort of intonation, with that sort of sound in our voice – “Oh, great” – we’re really saying, “That's terrible. That's bad.” It's just the opposite of what you would think the meaning of great would be in this case.

In a way, we’re using it sarcastically. We are trying to use it in a different way from the way it is normally used in order to either  be funny or to communicate a different message to the person, to say something d ifferent. Somebody says, “Oh, great. My car broke down.” This person doesn't  actually mean they're happy that the car doesn't work. They mean the opposite. They mean it's bad news. It all depends on the way you say it. “Oh great” means  something bad. “Oh, great!” means something good.

I said to Lucy that men are romantic, but they're n ot romantic in a way that women want. Lucy asked me what I meant, and I tried  to explain that many men see their job in the family as protecting or taking  care of the wife and the family, and that this was a mark of a good husband. The exp ression “a mark” or “the mark” (mark) of a good husband means that it's a si gn of a good husband. It's an indication of a good husband. You can use this expr ession, “the mark of” something, with lots of different situations. You c ould say, “The mark of a good actor is that he can remember all of his dialogue,”  or his “lines” as we call them in a movie or in a play. “The mark of,” then, means the quality or characteristic of something.

Lucy said that she could understand my point – that  is, my meaning – but that what I was calling romantic was not romantic in her  book. The expression “in my book” or “in your book” or “in her book” does not m ean a book that you own and read. We’re not talking about that kind of book. In stead, we're talking about my way of seeing the world, according to my way of thi nking, the way I see things, or the way I view things. For example, “In my book, it 's better to exercise early in the morning so that you have time to do it before you g o to work.” “In my book” here means in my opinion, in my view – the way I view th ings.

I said to Lucy that women have an “idealized view of romance.” “Idealized” (idealized) would be the perfect situation. Somethi ng that is idealized would be something in the best possible situation. Usually w e use it, however, to mean unrealistic or impossible to actually do or achieve . When someone says to you, “Well, that's an idealized view of” something, they  mean that that particular way of looking at things would only be possible in a pe rfect world. It can't really be possible for the average person, say.

I then used the expression “chick flicks” and “roma nce novels.” A “chick (chick) flick (flick)” is an informal expression. It refers  to the kinds of movies that women like, often romantic movies. The word “chick” refer s to a woman or a girl. However, it's not a very nice word. Many women and girls might not like it if you use that word with them. So, it's probably one you should not use. A “flick” is a movie. So, a “chick flick” would be a movie for wom en and girls.

A “romance novel” is a novel that is about a romant ic relationship between two people who love each other. However, the term “roma nce novel” refers to a specific kind of book that is popular mostly with w omen, about the romantic relationship of the main characters. There’s usuall y a very beautiful woman and a very handsome or good-looking man in the story. is aid to Lucy that “a man could never get into the head of a woman.” “To get into s omeone's head” means to understand her point of view, to understand her opi nion, to understand how she views the world.

Lucy says, however, that if men really loved women and really understood them, women would not have to tell men what they want. Sh e uses the expression “that is.” She says, “That is, if the man really loved an d understood us.” The expression “that is” is very common in conversation . It means I'm going to give you more of an explanation. I'm going to tell you a  little bit more about what I just said. I'm going to try to make it clear. For exampl e, I could say to someone, “Podcasting involves RSS syndication; that is, it's  a network that goes out over the Internet.” “That is” is used to say, “Let me ex plain a little more” or “I will say it in a different way, perhaps a way that you'll under stand better.”

I end the dialogue by saying, “Men are from Mars an d women are from Venus.” That’s actually the title of a very popular book ab out men and women and relationships. It was very popular, at least, in the 1990s: Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus . The idea is that they basically come from differe nt planets. They see everything very differently, and that's why they don't understand each other. I actually read part of the book. I think he was right about a lot of things, the author. Of course, it was writ ten by a man. Remember that

opinions in these dialogues are not necessarily the  opinions of the people who are speaking the lines.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
