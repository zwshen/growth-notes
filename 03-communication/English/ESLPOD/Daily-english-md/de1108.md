On this episode, we have a dialogue between Sydney and Isaac about exchanging money when you travel. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Sydney: Where should we go on our honeymoon? I thou ght Rome would be nice.

Isaac: Let me check. No, that wouldn’t be a good id ea.

Sydney: Okay, how about Tokyo? I’ve always wanted t o visit Japan.

Isaac: No, I’m afraid not.

Sydney: How are you making these determinations?

Isaac: I’m checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a  favorable exchange rate with those currencies. We want our dollars to go as far as they can.

Sydney: You mean you want to pick our honeymoon des tination according to the currency market.

Isaac: I’m just saying that we should take advantag e of falling currencies or ones that have already depreciated significantly. A stro ng dollar means we can get more bang for the buck.

Sydney: So you’re saying that you want us to make p lans at the whim of the Federal Reserve and central banks.

Isaac: Well, I wouldn’t go that far. I’m only sayin g that it would make financial sense.

Sydney: That doesn’t seem like a very romantic way of picking a honeymoon destination.

Isaac: Romance is overrated. Wouldn’t you rather be  solvent than sentimental?

Sydney: I’d rather be solvent and  sentimental.

Sydney asks Isaac, “Where should we go on our honey moon?” Your “honeymoon” (honeymoon) is the vacation you take af ter you get married. Usually, but not always, it’s immediately after the  wedding. Sometimes people take their honeymoon later. The honeymoon is suppos ed to be, of course, a wonderful time for the married couple, and often the last wonderful time they have. I’m just kidding, of course. Marriage has hap piness beyond the honeymoon. It often lasts another month or two.

Sydney suggests they go to Rome – Rome, Italy, of c ourse. Isaac says, “Let me check” – let me investigate. “No,” he says, “that w ouldn’t be a good idea.” Now, we’re not sure what Isaac is checking when he says,  “Let me check.” We’re not sure what he’s investigating in order to say yes or  no. Sydney then gives him another suggestion. She says, “Okay, how about Toky o?” – Tokyo, Japan, of course. “I’ve always wanted to visit Japan,” she sa ys. Isaac says, “No, I’m afraid not.” “I’m afraid not” is just another way of sayin g no. It’s a little more polite.

Sydney then says, “How are you making these determi nations?” which is, of course, a very good question. A “determination” is a decision or an assessment – how you decide one way or another. Isaac says, “I’m  checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a favorable exchange rate with those cur rencies.” So, Isaac is making this determination based upon the exchange rate. the “exchange rate” is basically the amount of money that you get when you , in effect, buy another country’s money, another country’s currency.

“Currency” (currency) refers to the system the mone y that is used in a particular country. In the United States, we use dollars. But if I’m going to go to Europe, I would in many countries need to exchange my dollars  for euros. I would need, basically, to buy euros. A “favorable exchange rate ” is when you can get a lot of money in the other country for the money in your co untry. So, a favorable

exchange rate between say the U.S. dollar and the e uro would mean that I could get a lot of euros for my dollar. And as we record this in 2015, that is true.

Isaac, then, is making his decision about where he and Sydney should go on their honeymoon by looking at the exchange rates. H e says, “We want our dollars to go as far as they can,” meaning we want to get as much for our money as possible. Sydney is not very happy when she lear ns this. She says, “You mean you want to pick our honeymoon destination acc ording to the currency market.”

Sydney is saying that Isaac wants to “pick” (pick),  or select, the honeymoon location based on the currency market – the price o f different currencies. A “market” is usually a word we use to describe the s ystem or the mechanism for people to buy and sell things. So, the “currency ma rket” would be buying and selling of currencies, of different kinds of money.  Isaac says, “I’m just saying that we should take advantage of falling currencies or o nes that have depreciated significantly.”

For a currency to “fall” means that it has become l ess expensive or less valuable. “Falling” here refers to decreasing – becoming smal ler or lower. We could talk about the stock market falling. That would mean tha t the price of stocks was going down. Isaac thinks that they should select th eir honeymoon location based on the state of the currency in that country. He al so mentions “depreciated currencies.” The verb “to depreciate” (depreciate) means to lessen in value or worth, to be worth less money – at least that’s wha t Isaac means here.

He says, “A strong dollar means we can get more ban g for the buck.” A “strong dollar” would be a dollar that keeps its value, tha t is expensive relative to other currencies. The phrase “bang (bang) for the buck (b uck)” refers to getting a lot for your money. “Buck” refers to money here, American m oney. We refer to one dollar as a “buck.” “To get a lot of bang for your buck” means to get a lot for your money, to get a very good value. Sydney says, “So, you’re saying that you want us to make plans at the whim of the Federal Reserve  and central banks.”

The expression “at the whim (whim) of” means based on some rather unpredictable idea of another person or organizatio n. We have a related expression, “on a whim,” which means to do somethin g without thinking about it closely or carefully. So to be “at the whim of” som eone means that your future – things that are important to you – depend on someon e else’s decision, someone else who may not make a decision very rationally or  might make a decision arbitrarily – without any good reason for it.

Sydney is saying that their plans depend on the dec isions of the Federal Reserve and the central banks. The “Federal Reserve” is the  national bank of the United States. A “central bank” of a country – or in the c ase of the European Union, of the E.U. – is the bank that helps determine and reg ulate the monetary system for that country or that area or region. The central ba nk typically decides how much money it’s going to print. Here in the U.S. that wo uld mean how many dollars will be available in the economy.

Isaac disagrees with Sidney’s description of his ap proach to planning their honeymoon. He says. “Well, I wouldn’t go that far,”  meaning that’s partially true, but not as much as you are saying. He says, “I’m on ly saying that it would make financial sense” – it would make economic sense for  the two of them. Sydney, however, says, “That doesn’t seem like a very roman tic way to pick a honeymoon destination.” Something that is “romantic” (romanti c) is something related to feelings of love toward another person – an express ion of that love.

Then Isaac says something very stupid, very foolish . He says, “Romance is overrated.” To say something is “overrated” (overra ted) means that people think it’s more important than it really is, more signifi cant than it actually is. You would never want to say that to your girlfriend, wife, or  in this case, fiancé – the woman who is going to marry you. Isaac says, “Wouldn’t yo u rather be solvent than sentimental?”

“To be solvent” (solvent) means that you have enoug h money to pay for your expenses. You have enough money to live on. You hav e enough money to pay your bills. “Sentimental” (sentimental) refers to a  person who is strongly influenced by feelings and perhaps is basing their decisions more on feelings than on reason, than on intellect. Isaac says, “Wou ldn’t you rather be solvent than sentimental?”

He’s saying that there is this choice: either you c an be solvent – either you can spend money wisely – or you can be sentimental; you  can be guided by your feelings. Sydney doesn’t think you have to choose b etween these two options. She says, “I’d rather be solvent and  sentimental,” which I think is true, of course. You can pay your bills and still follow your heart.  Now that’s romantic.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
