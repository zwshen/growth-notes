This episode is a dialogue between Yuki and Al abou t what to do when your children misbehave – when they don’t do what they’r e supposed to do – and you have to punish them. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Yuki: What are you doing? 

Al: I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking fo r beating up his classmate. He has to learn that there are serious consequences fo r his actions. 

Yuki: You’re punishing him for beating someone by g iving him a beating? That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an ey e for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 

Al: I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging. I’m going to give him a simple spanking.  

Yuki: Corporal punishment isn’t the answer. We can give him a severe punishment without resorting to violence. 

Al: What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowa nce or taking away his toys? Those don’t seem severe enough to me.  

Yuki: We could ground him for a month, only allowin g him to go to school. 

Al: That still doesn’t seem to be enough. 

Yuki: All right, we can pull out the big guns then.  We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some s ense into him. He’s scared of your mother. 

Al: I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work? 

Yuki: If I were a 10-year-old and I had to face you r angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots!

Yuki begins our dialogue by asking Al, “What are yo u doing?” Al says, “I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking for beatin g up his classmate.” A “spanking” (spanking) is the practice of hitting a child with your hand or some other object on the child’s behind, on the child’s rear, on their butt – the part they sit down on.  

This has long been a traditional way of punishing a  child, of indicating to the child that what they did was wrong and giving them someth ing to think about if they try to do it again. I’m not arguing. I’m not saying spa nking is right or wrong. I’m not a child psychologist. I can’t answer that question, b ut I can explain what the practice is, and it’s something that parents – at l east, when I was growing up – would do to their children to discipline them, to p unish them.  

Al is getting ready to give Charlie a spanking “for  beating up his classmate.” “To beat (beat) up” means to hurt someone physically in  a fight. Charlie, it seems, beat up his classmate – another one of the students  in his class at school. Yuki says, “You’re punishing him for beating someone up by giving him a beating?” “To punish” (punish), as we mentioned earlier, mean s to do something to someone to discourage them from doing it again, or simply out of a sense of philosophical justice.  

Once again, we won’t go into the arguments about pu nishment. Yuki says that Al is punishing Charlie for beating someone up, for hi tting someone, by hitting Charlie. She thinks this is not very logical. In fa ct, she says, “That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an eye for an eye,  a tooth for a tooth.”  

This expression, which comes from the Bible, means that you respond to someone who does something bad to you by doing some thing equally bad to him or her. “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” mi ght mean literally “If you take out my eye, I’ll take out your eye.” But in general, th e term means getting back at  

someone or getting even with someone by doing somet hing bad to that person who did something bad to you. 

Al says, “I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t goi ng to be a flogging.” A “flogging” (flogging) is a very serious physical punishment wh ere someone is usually hit with a stick or a rope, often on their back, as a p unishment. There aren’t any places in the United States, at least, where you wo uld get a flogging. In fact, you’d probably be arrested by the police if you gav e your child a flogging.  

Al is saying he’s  not giving Charlie a flogging. H e says instead, “I’m going to give him a simple spanking,” meaning not a serious spank ing, not seriously hurting him. But Yuki doesn’t agree. Yuki says, “Corporal p unishment isn’t the answer.” “Corporal” (corporal) refers to the body. So, “corp oral punishment” is physical punishment – punishing someone’s body by hitting th em, for example.  

Yuki says, “We can give him,” meaning Charlie, “a s evere punishment without resorting to violence.” A “severe (severe) punishme nt,” is a very strong punishment, a significant or major punishment. “Res orting to” something means turning to something or choosing to do something wh en you don’t have any other options available – at least, that’s what we typica lly use it to mean. “I had to resort to violence when the person on the street st arted attacking me.” I didn’t want to hit him but I had to. I had to resort to vi olence.  

What Yuki is saying is that we don’t have to resort  to violence. We have other choices. We can choose other ways of punishing litt le Charlie without hitting him. Al says, “What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowance or taking away his toys? That doesn’t seem severe enough to me.” “To w ithhold” (withhold) something means to prevent someone from having some thing, especially having something that the person expects to have.  

“To withhold your love” would be not to give your l ove to someone who might be expecting your love. If the company you work for “w ithholds money” to pay your taxes, that’s money they don’t give you in order to  do something with that money. And in fact, in the United States, if you are an em ployee, the company you work for will withhold taxes from you. Al is talking her e about withholding Charlie’s “allowance” (allowance).  

An “allowance” is money that is given to a child on  a regular basis, often once a week or so, sometimes in exchange for or because th e child does some work around the house, sometimes simply so that the chil d has the money to buy things with. When I was growing up, there were no a llowances. In fact, even if you worked around the house – and you were expected  to work around the  

house – you would not be given an allowance. I neve r heard of such a thing even for most of my friends, but it is quite popular amo ng parents nowadays. 

Al thinks that withholding his allowance or taking away his toys would not be a severe enough punishment for Charlie. Yuki says, “W e could ground him for a month, only allowing him to go to school.” When a p arent “grounds” (grounds) his or her child, the parent is punishing the child by not allowing him or her to leave the house and sometimes even to leave their room ot her than to come down and eat and to use the bathroom.  

Usually, however, “grounding” refers to telling a c hild that he or she cannot go out and play with his or her friends – that he or s he has to stay at home, other than of course going to school. But Al isn’t convin ced. He says, “That still doesn’t seem to be enough.” He doesn’t think that’s a suffi cient punishment to teach Charlie not to go around beating up his classmates.   

Yuki says, “All right. We can pull out the big guns  then.” The expression “to pull out the big guns” (guns) means to do the most power ful forceful thing you can do – to do something or to use some instrument or tool  that is the most powerful you can possibly think of. In the case of punishing Cha rlie, Yuki says, “We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some sense into him.”  

Yuki is suggesting that Charlie spend the weekend w ith his grandmother, Al’s mother, and have his grandmother “talk some sense i nto him.” “To talk some sense (sense) into” someone means to persuade someo ne to agree to something, especially someone who doesn’t seem to b e acting rationally or logically. To convince someone to change their way of thinking is to talk sense into someone.  

Yuki says that Charlie is scared of Al’s mother. Al  says, “I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?” Yuki says, “If  I were a 10-year-old boy and I had to face your angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots.” “Disapproving” is when someon e is not pleased with your behavior or your performance.  

Yuki is saying here that if she were a 10-year-old boy like Charlie and she had to face – that is, to be with – Al’s angry and disappr oving mother for an entire or complete weekend, she’d be “quaking in her boots.” “To quake (quake) in your boots (boots)” means to be very scared, to be very frightened. “Boots” are large pairs of shoes that go over your feet, especially w hen there is rain outside or snow outside. “To quake” here means to shake.   

 So, “to quake in your boots” would be to be so scar ed that you are shaking – your whole body is shaking – and that’s the idea th at Yuki is trying to convey here: that going to Al’s mother’s house for the wee kend would make the 10-year- old Charlie rather scared and would be a very sever e punishment for him.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Yuki: What are you doing? 

Al: I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking fo r beating up his classmate. He has to learn that there are serious consequences fo r his actions. 

Yuki: You’re punishing him for beating someone by g iving him a beating? That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an ey e for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 

Al: I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging. I’m going to give him a simple spanking.  

Yuki: Corporal punishment isn’t the answer. We can give him a severe punishment without resorting to violence. 

Al: What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowa nce or taking away his toys? Those don’t seem severe enough to me.  

Yuki: We could ground him for a month, only allowin g him to go to school. 

Al: That still doesn’t seem to be enough.

Al: I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?
