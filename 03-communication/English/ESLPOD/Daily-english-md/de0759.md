This episode is about worrying about your children.   Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pavel:  I’m really worried about Hanna.  She’s been  hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs with the wrong crowd.

Hillary:  Hanna is rebelling a little.  That’s natu ral at her age.  When I was her age, I thought I knew more than my parents or any a dult, and that I should be able to make all of my own decisions.

Pavel:  I’m not talking about being stricter on her , but she’s become so secretive. I’m really worried that she might get exposed to th ings that should be off-limits at her age.

Hillary:  There’s no way we can keep her from seein g her friends short of locking her in her room.  We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs into problems.  We raised her right and she can handle h erself.

Pavel:  I wish I had your confidence.  She’s a girl , remember?  All kinds of things can happen to girls.

Hillary:  We’ve talked to her a lot about those thi ngs and what we feel are right and wrong.  A lot of things can happen to boys, too , or don’t you remember? Hanna takes after you and she has your brains and r esourcefulness.  Like father, like daughter, so stop worrying so much,

Pavel:  Do you really think she’ll be okay?

Hillary:  Yes, I do.  Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you. When she has a daughter of her own, she’ll stay up nights worrying, just like you.

Pavel:  That’s small comfort!

[end of dialogue]

Pavel begins by saying to Hillary, “I’m really worr ied about Hanna.  She’s been hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs  with the wrong crowd.”  Pavel is worried about Hanna, his daughter, because she’s  been hanging around with that girl Carla.  “To hang around with” means to sp end your time with, especially your free time, time that you can use however you want.  It isn’t clear what you are doing, there isn’t a clear activity; you’re jus t spending time with that person you’re hanging around with.  Sometimes informally I  think now people might say “I’m just hanging with my friends” instead of “hang ing around,” but they mean the same thing.  Pavel is concerned that his daughter i s hanging around or spending time with a girl named Carla.  Why?  Well, because Carla runs with the wrong crowd.  The expression “to run with the wrong crowd ,” or group of people, is to spend time with people who are not doing good thing s, people that will have a bad influence, in this case, on his daughter.

Hillary says, “Hanna is rebelling a little.”  “To r ebel” (rebel) means to disagree with someone in authority.  To not follow what your  parents or your government or teacher says, that is to rebel.  There’s an a no un, which is “rebellion,” which is the act of rebelling, and the person who rebels is called a “rebel.”  A “rebel,” stress on the first syllable, is the person who reb els; the verb, stress on the second syllable.  Hillary says that Hanna is rebell ing a little, “That’s natural at her age.”  When you say “that’s natural,” here we mean it’s normal, it’s to be expected.  “Natural” has a couple of different mean ings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  Hillary says, “W hen I was her age (when I was the same age as my daughter), I thought I knew more than my parents or any adult, and that I should be able to make all of  my own decisions.”  This is something that many teenagers, of course, believe.

Pavel says, “I’m not talking about being stricter o n her.”  “To be strict” (strict) means that you have rules, in this case for your ch ildren, and you don’t make any exceptions; they must follow exactly your rules.  T hat’s to be strict with your children.  “Stricter” would be the comparative, to be more strict.  Pavel says that his daughter is becoming secretive.  “Secretive” me ans that you keep secrets, you don’t tell someone about what you are doing, yo u don’t give them any information about what you are doing.  Pavel says, “I’m really worried that she might get exposed to things that should be off-limi ts at her age.”  “To be” or “get

exposed to (something)” means that you have some ex perience with it; you see it or you are aware of it.  “Off-limits” (off-limits) means not permitted, not allowed. You might see a sign in a school saying “The princi pal’s office is off-limits to students.”  You are not allowed there, you are not permitted there.  Pavel is worried that his daughter will be exposed to things  that she shouldn’t be at her young age, that should be off-limits, that she shou ld not see.

Hillary says, “There’s no way we can keep her from seeing her friends short of locking her in her room.”  “To keep her from (doing  something)” means to prevent her, to stop her from doing something.  There’s no way to keep her from seeing her friends short of locking her in her room.  “Sho rt of” here means except or unless, but usually it’s used, as it is here, for a n extreme action, something that you wouldn’t normally do.  “Short of selling their home they don’t see how they can pay their doctor bills.”  There’s no other choi ce.  Well, Hillary is saying that the only way they can keep their daughter from seei ng her friends is to lock her in her room, which they wouldn’t want to do.

Hillary says, “We have to trust her.”  “To trust” m eans to believe that, in this case, the person will act appropriately, will the right t hing – the correct thing.  “We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs int o problems.”  That is, if she has problems we have to let her ask us – come to us, co me and talk to us, we can’t go and talk to her about it.  I’m not sure if that’ s true, but that’s what Hillary believes.  She says, “We raised her right and she can handle herself.”  “To raise (raise) (someone)” is to take care of and educate s omeone from the time, usually, they’re a baby until they’re an adult.  “T o handle (one’s self)” means to be in control of what you are thinking and what you  are doing, to be able to get through a certain situation, especially if it’s a d ifficult situation.  If someone says, “I can handle myself,” they mean I can do it by mys elf, I don’t need anyone else to help me.

Pavel says, “I wish I had your confidence.”  He doe sn’t the same confidence – the same belief that Hillary does in his daughter.  “She’s a girl, remember?  All kinds of things can happen to girls.”  Hillary says , “We’ve talked to her a lot about those things and what we feel are right and wrong.  A lot of things can happen to boys, too, or don’t you remember?”  Pavel is saying  that a young girl – a teenage girl – could get into more trouble than a teenage b oy.  That may be the opinion of a lot of parents I would guess.  But Hillary, the m other, is saying that boys can get into trouble, too.  Hillary says that she and P avel have talked to Hanna, and Hanna knows what’s right and what’s wrong.

“Hanna,” the mother says, and notice the psychology  here of the mother, her thinking, to try to convince the husband not to wor ry, “Hanna takes after you and

she has your brains and resourcefulness.”  The moth er is saying that Hanna takes after her father.  “To take after” means that  they behave or they are like that person, usually a parent or an older relative.   If the oldest sister likes to swim and youngest sister starts swimming, you might say,  “Well, she takes after her older sister.”  She follows the example of her olde r sister.  In this case, Hanna takes after the father, Pavel, and has his brains a nd resourcefulness.  “She has his brains” means she is as smart as he is.  Of cou rse, Hillary is complimenting – is saying something nice about the father.  She als o says that the father and Hanna are resourceful.  “Resourceful” means that yo u are able to use what is available to you and make the best use of it, to ge t the maximum benefit from whatever you have available.  That’s to be resource ful; the noun is “resourcefulness.”  She then uses a version of a po pular expression; the popular expression is “like father, like son,” meaning the son will behave the way the father does.  But she says, changing the expression , “Like father, like daughter,” meaning the daughter will be like the father, so the father doesn’t have to worry because the daughter is just like he is.  “Stop wor rying so much,” Hillary says.

Pavel says, “Do you really think she’ll be okay?”  Hillary says, “Yes, I do.  Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you .”  “To take comfort in (something)” means to feel comforted by, to know th at you don’t have to worry because of this piece of information – of this thin g.  “Take comfort in knowing that even if it rains we’re inside a building and we won ’t get wet.”  “To take comfort in” means to get some sort of positive emotion or some,  we might say, reassurance that things are going to be okay.

Hillary says, “When she has a daughter of her own ( when Hanna has a daughter of her own), she’ll stay up nights worrying, just l ike you.”  Well, Pavel doesn’t think this is very comforting, this isn’t very reas suring.  That’s why he ends by saying, “That’s small comfort!”  “Small comfort” me ans it’s not very comforting, it doesn’t help.  It doesn’t really matter that Hanna,  when she grows up and has a daughter, will also worry.  Pavel thinks that isn’t  very reassuring, that isn’t very comforting, and I must agree, he’s probably right.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
