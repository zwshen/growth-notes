This episode is called “Assigning Blame in a Car Accident.”   “Blame” is who did something wrong.  So figuring out – determining – wh o did something wrong when two cars have an accident.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tarik:  Are you okay?

Stacey:  Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little shaken up, but look at my car!

Tarik:  Mine is in pretty bad shape, too.  Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.

Stacey:  Okay, let’s exchange insurance information, so we ca n both get out of here.

Tarik:  Right.  I’ll put in a claim today and your insur ance should pay to repair both of our cars.

Stacey:  What?  This accident wasn’t my fault.  You crashed into me!  You rear ended me!

Tarik:  That’s only because you swerved in front of me and  slammed on your brakes!

Stacey:  I did no such thing.  I changed lanes and you beg an tailgating me. That’s why you rear ended me.  I’m not to blame here.

 Tarik:  That’s your account of what happened, and it doe sn’t jibe with mine.  I say we each call our respective insurance companies and let th em battle it out.

Stacey:  Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with someon e who won’t own up to his mistakes.

Tarik:  Those are my thoughts exactly.

Tarik and Stacey had a “car accident,” one car hit the ot her.  Tarik begins, after he gets out of the car I guess, by asking Stacey, “Are you o kay?” meaning physically.  Stacey says, “Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little  shaken up, but look at my car!”  “To be shaken (shaken) up” means to be shocked, scare d, a little confused especially after something very traumatic, somethin g that may cause you pain either emotional or physical.  In this case, it w as the car accident that shook up Stacey.  The phrasal verb is “to shake up.”

Stacey is worried about her car.  Tarik says, “Mine (mean ing my car) is in pretty bad shape, too,” meaning very bad shape, very damaged.  Tarik says, “Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.”  Notice he doesn’ t say “It is a good thing,” he uses a sentence form here that isn’t necessarily completely gr ammatical but is quite common normal conversation, especially with this phr ase “good thing.” “Good thing you’re okay,” that means it is a good thing  that you are okay.  Tarik says, “Good thing, it (his car) wasn’t totaled.”  When you  “total your car” you completely destroy it, usually by accident – we hope!  “Tota l” has a number of different meanings that are different than that; you can find those, or at least some of them, in the Learning Guide.

When you have a car accident in the United States, many t imes people will call the police.  However if it’s not a serious accident, that isn’t always necessary. Instead, people will give each other their contact infor mation, especially their insurance information.  So Stacey says, “Okay, let’s exchange  insurance information, so we can both get out of here (we can b oth leave).”  “Insurance” is when you pay a small amount of money to a company each m onth or each year, and then if something bad happens to you, like a car a ccident, they will pay to fix your car.  Stacey and Tarik exchange this information; she g ives her information to him, he gives his information to her.

Tarik says, “Right.  I’ll put in a claim today and your in surance should pay to repair both of our cars.”  Now, this is where the prob lem starts.  When you have a

 car accident, you should not argue with the other person.   It doesn’t matter what you think or what the other person thinks, it matters wha t the insurance company thinks.  If you have two different insurance companies – T arik has one, Stacey has another – then the person who is to blame – that i s, the person you caused the accident; we would also say who is “at fault” – their  insurance company has to pay to fix the other car, as well as the car of their  insured customer.  Tarik is saying that Stacey caused the accident because he’s saying tha ther insurance should pay to repair both of their cars.  In order to g et the insurance company to pay for the damage in an accident, you have to put in a “claim” (claim).  That means you have to send them documents – pieces of paper – r equesting a payment – requesting that they pay you.

Stacey says, “What?  This accident wasn’t my fault.”  “Faul t,” here, means responsibility.  “Fault” has a number of other meaning s, and those are in the Learning Guide.  Stacey is saying that the accident, the  fact that the two cars hit each other – crashed into each other – was not her fau lt.  Stacey says, “You crashed into me!”  “To crash into” means to hit someone w hile you’re moving at a high speed.  So, a car could crash into a tree if it’s g oing very fast.  Stacey says that Tarik crashed into her car, so it’s his fault.  She says, “You rear ended me!” “To rear (rear) end (someone)” is a two-word phrasal ve rb meaning when one car hits the back of another car, usually because that car wa s too close – was traveling too close – and so they did not stop in time – they did not stop before they hit the other car.  That’s to rear end someone.  I t’s always used in talking about cars, typically.

Tarik says, arguing now with Stacey, “That’s only because you  swerved in front of me and slammed on your brakes!”  “To swerve” (swerve) me ans to turn sharply, quickly, and suddenly to try to avoid hitting someth ing else.  So you’re in your car and you’re driving down the road and you see a c at in front of you, you might swerve so that you don’t hit the cat.  I might not !  But you will probably swerve; you will move your car quickly to the left or to the  right.  Tarik is saying that Stacey swerved in front of him – in front of his ca r, and then she slammed on her brakes.  “To slam (slam) on your brakes (or the brakes) ” means to stop your car suddenly, very, we might say, abruptly.  Your “brakes” a re the part of the car that stops the wheels from moving, and you have a little thing in the front of your car by your foot called a “brake pedal” (pedal) that you  step on – you press – in order to stop the car.  “To slam on your brakes” means to  do that suddenly, quickly.  That’s what Stacey did according to Tarik, and the refore Tarik didn’t have a chance to stop after she did this, because it was so su dden.

 Stacey says, “I did no such thing (meaning I didn’t do an ything like that).  I changed lanes and you began tailgating me.”  The parts of the road where you drive are called the “lanes.”  Usually in a big street there are two lanes going in one direction and two lanes in another direction, so there are two rows of cars. What Stacey is saying is that Stacey changed lanes – moved fro m the right lane, let’s say, to the left lane – and Tarik began tailgatin g Stacey.  “To tailgate” (tailgate – one word) means to follow closely behind an other car, to be too close to the car in front of you.  Stacey says, “That’s why you rear ended me.  I’m not to blame here,” I’m not the one who is at fault.

Tarik says, “That’s your account (that’s your version; your stor y) of what happened, and it doesn’t jibe (jibe) with mine (with  my story).”  “To jibe” means to match, so that it’s the same information.  Here they have  two different stories; they don’t jibe.  “I say we each call our respective insur ance companies and let them battle it out.”  “Respective” means you call your co mpany and I’ll call my company; it’s what belongs to you and what belongs to me.   “Respective” belongs to a certain person, so: “The children after schoo l go home to their respective houses,” the ones that are theirs.  Tarik says we’l l let the insurance companies battle it out.  This expression, “to battle it out,” means to argue or to fight over something, usually for a long period of tim e.  To battle it out – to have a long argument or fight.

Stacey says, “Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with som eone (there’s no reason to argue with someone) who won’t own up to his mistakes. ”  “To own up” means to admit that you are responsible, that you are wrong; you say yes, that was my fault, I am to blame.  So, Stacey is saying that Tarik w ill not own up to his mistakes, the things he did wrong.  Tarik, of course, thi nks that Stacey is in the same situation; she won’t own up to her mistakes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tarik:  Are you okay?

Stacey:  Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little shaken up, but look at my car!

Tarik:  Mine is in pretty bad shape, too.  Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.

Stacey:  Okay, let’s exchange insurance information, so we ca n both get out of here.

Stacey:  Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with someon e who won’t own up to his mistakes.

I hope my explanation of today’s dialogue jibes with the ideas of the person who wrote it, Dr. Lucy Tse.
