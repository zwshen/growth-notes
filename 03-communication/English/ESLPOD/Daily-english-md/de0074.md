[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with me saying, “I will be in C hicago next week and need a rental car.” Chicago is located in the central part  of the United States, in the state of Illinois. “I called up Bargain Rental Cars and m ade a reservation.” “Bargain Rental Cars” is just a made-up name, not a real com pany that rents cars. A “bargain” is a good deal, a low price. I called up this rental car company and made a “reservation.” A “reservation” is when you make some arrangement to use a service or perhaps to use a physical object f or a certain amount of time. Here, I'm reserving a car. I want to use a car when  I am in Chicago. “After I got through the phone tree, I spoke with a reservation agent.”

The term “phone tree” refers to a system of announc ements that you hear when you are trying to get a hold of someone, when you a re trying to contact someone, in a large company. A lot of companies, when you ca ll the phone number for the company, do not have a live human being answering t he phone. Instead, you hear a message. Typically, the message will say som ething like, “If you'd like information on this topic, press 1. If you'd like i nformation on this topic, press 2,” and then you have to keep pressing different number s or saying different numbers until you get to the information or the per son you want. That's a phone tree.

I say, “After I got through the phone tree” – after  I found the right option – “I spoke with a reservation agent.” An “agent” (agent)  is a person who works for a company, who is responsible for talking to customer s. The president of the company doesn't have time to talk to every customer , so they hire people to work for the company, called “agents,” who talk directly  to the customer when the customer has questions. You can have a “customer se rvice agent” – that's a person who deals with the customers and gives them service, gives them help. Some companies call them by a special name.

Here, we use the term “reservation agent” – that wo uld be the person who is going to help me make a reservation. The agent answ ers the phone, “Welcome to Bargain Rental Car.” That's a very formal way th at a company might use to answer the phone. I say, “I'd like to reserve a ren tal car.” The agent then asked me, “What city will you be picking up from?” “To pi ck something up” from somewhere is to go to a particular location in orde r to get something. Here, she's asking where I will pick up the car, where I will g et the car. I may pick up at one

location and drop off at a different location. We’l l talk about dropping off in a minute.

“Picking up a car” means getting the car the first day so that you can drive it and use it. I tell her that I'll be picking it up in Ch icago. She then asked, “Which airport location?” She's asking which place I want to pick it up, since in many big cities there is more than one airport. The Los Angeles are a, for example, has at least three large airports and several small airports. the agent asks if I want to pick up the car at “O'Hare” or “Midway.” Those are the name s of two large airports in the Chicago area. I say, “I'm not sure. Is there a down town location?” Now I'm asking if I can pick up my car not at the airport, but som ewhere in the central part of the city.

The agent says, “Sure, we have an office at 401 Sta te Street” – that's the place where I could go and pick up a car downtown. I then  asked the agent, “Is that near Prairie State College?” I'm asking if the plac e where I can pick up the car is near to the place where I want to go, which in this  dialogue is a made-up college by the name of “Prairie State College.” That's not a real college. The agent doesn't know if Prairie State College is near the d owntown location. I say, “That's okay. I'll go ahead and make a reservation for that  location.” “I'll go ahead” means I will continue on. I want to make the reserv ation.

The agent asked for what date and time. I say, “For  November 11 th , around 7 p.m.” – seven o'clock in the evening. Then the agen t asked me, “Returning to the same location?” That means, “Are you going to bring  the car back” – are you going to return the car – “to the same place where you picked it up?” I say, “No. I'd like to drop it off at the Chicago O'Hare airpo rt.” “To drop something off” is the opposite of “to pick something up.” It's to leave it when you are finished using it – in this case, giving the car back to the rental car  company. The agent asks, “Okay, on what date and time?” I say, “It'll be tha t Sunday, November 13 th , around the same time” – approximately at the same t ime.

The agent says, “What size would you like? A compac t, mid-size, or full-size?” There are three basic sizes you can rent a car in. The smallest size is called a “compact” (compact). Usually, a compact car is very  small and often has only two doors. A regular car that has four doors and is lar ger would be called a “full-size car.” In between a full-size car and a compact car is a “mid- (mid-) size car.” A mid-size car is not small but not large – somewhere  in between. Usually, mid- sized cars do have four doors.

I say, “I'd like the most economical.” When we talk  about something being “economical,” we mean it's not expensive. It's chea p. It doesn't cost a lot of

money. I want the cheapest car I can rent, which is  what I always do in real life when I rent a car. I always rent the cheapest car I  can find. The agent says, “That would be the compact,” meaning if you want the chea pest car, you want to rent the compact car. Then she tells me that “The rental  fee would be $32.25 a day, giving you a grand total of $62.50 for the two days .”

The “rental fee” (fee) is the price of the car. The  agent is giving me the price of the car for each day. She says it “would be” – it w ill be – “$32.25 a day.” She doesn't use the words “dollar” and “cents.” She jus t says “$32.25.” When you're talking about prices, the person will understand fr om the context, from the conversation, what that means. It doesn't mean $3,2 25 dollars a day, although it could. It means $32.25. The agent then says that the total would be $62.50 – 62 dollars and 50 cents for the two days.

I say, “Does that include taxes and fees?” In most places, when you rent a car, you have to pay taxes. You have to pay the governme nt some additional money. Also, sometimes when they give you the price of the  rental car, there are additional costs, additional fees that they don't i nclude in the daily fee that they tell you. In other words, something that would not be included in the $32.25 a day. You have to be very careful to make sure that the price you are getting when you rent a car in the United States includes t he taxes and fees – all the additional costs.

Of course, the gas is not included. You have to pay  for your own gas. And usually when you rent a car in the United States, y ou have to fill the gas tank up again before you return it. If you don't, they will  charge you for the gas that they have to put in the car so that the next person can use it. The agent says, “No,” meaning no, it doesn't include taxes and fees.

She then says, “With all applicable taxes and fees,  your grand total comes to $77.40.” “Applicable” (applicable) means relevant –  connected to what we are talking about. “All applicable taxes” would be all the taxes that would apply to or be relevant to this transaction, this rental. It's not really a necessary term. Of course the company is not going to charge you taxes  for things that are not applicable, but it's one of those terms that has be en adopted by a lot of businesses nowadays. They use that term. The agent says the “grand total” comes to $77.40. The “grand (grand) total” is the f inal total after all the expenses are added together.

Sometimes, the company that you are purchasing some thing from will give you a total that just includes certain costs and then the y say, “Well, adding the taxes and the other things, the grand total is . . .” wha tever it is. The term “grand total”

 is also used, many times, when you are buying more than one thing. You may be buying several different items from a store. The pe rson who is giving you the prices may give you the individual prices for each thing you buy and then at the end say, “The grand total is . . .” – and that woul d include all of the things that you are buying.

I say, “Okay that's fine” – that's okay. She then a sks for my last name and I spell it for her. She says, “And your first name?” I say,  “Jeff.” The agent doesn't understand me, so she says “J-E-S-S?” She thinks my  name is Jess, and I say, “No, J-E-F, as in Frank, F.” Like many languages, E nglish has certain words that we use when we are trying to communicate the letter  that might be difficult for the other person to hear or to distinguish. Different c ountries, I'm guessing, in English have different words that they use.

There isn't one official set of words that everyone  who speaks English uses. People will often use the names of common objects o r of people. So, I use the name “Frank.” “F, as in Frank” means if you think of the word “Frank,” the first letter is “F” – that that's the letter I'm talking about. It's always the first letter that you use. So, you might say, “B, as in Boy.” The wor d “boy” begins with a “B,” and that's how you know that I'm saying “B” and not “D”  or “G.”

Again, it's hard to give you a list of these words.  In some languages, there is an established list that everyone uses, but not in Eng lish. I actually use the list that is used internationally by radio operators and mili tary people. Some people know this list, but it's used mostly by government offic ials and military officials. The words in alphabetical order from A-Z are “Alpha,” “ Bravo,” “Charlie,” “Delta,” “Echo,” “Foxtrot,” “Golf,” “Hotel,” “India,” “Julie t,” “Kilo,” “Lima,” “Mike,” “November,” “Oscar,” “Papa,” “Quebec,” “Romeo,” “Si erra,” “Tango,” “Uniform,” “Victor,” “Whiskey,” “X-ray,” “Yankee,” and “Zulu.”  Now you know.

The dialogue ends with the agent asking me what cre dit card I want to use. I say, “I’ll be using a MasterCard.” “MasterCard,” “Visa,”  and “American Express” are the three most popular credit cards in the United S tates. The agent then repeats the information about my reservation and asks me if  there is another reservation she can help me with. I say, “No. That's all. Thank s.” That's all means I'm done. I don’t have anything else to get from you or ask of you.

The agent then says, “It's my pleasure.” That's a v ery formal way to say, “You're welcome.” “It's my pleasure. Have a good afternoon and thank you for calling Bargain Rental Car.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
