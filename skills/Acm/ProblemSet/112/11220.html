<h1>B. Decoding the message</h1>
<h3>Time limit: 1 s</h3>

<p> Chico and Maria are relatives that live in different towns. As
they inhabit a rural area, it is very difficult for them to keep in
touch. One way they found to overcome their communication problem was
to send a line through their parents that used to visit each other.
</p>

<p> The point is that Chico and Maria did not want that their parents
read their messages, and they decided to create a secret code for the
messages.  The code is not very sophisticated, but you should keep in
mind Chico and Maria are just children.  </p>

<p> In general, the meaning of a message is based on a letter of each
word, in a way that they will form a message with the first letter of
the first word, the second letter of the second word and so on. If a
word does not have enough letters, the following word should be
used. For example, if you are analyzing the third word, you should
consider its third letter, but if it just has two letters, then you
should try to form a decoded word with the third letter of the fourth
word.  </p>

<p> When the end of a line is reached, you should finish the current
decoded word and should start to form another one from the first
letter of the first word in the next line.  </p>

<p> Your task is to translate a message according to Chico and Maria's
secret code.  </p>


<h2>Input</h2>

<p> The first line of input gives the number of cases, <math>T</math>
(<math>1 &le; T &le; 30</math>), then there is a blank line before the
first test case.  Each test case represents a message, which is
composed by <math>1 &le; N &le; 100</math> lines and each line is
composed by <math>1 &le; M &le; 30</math> words. Two words in the same line
are separated by one or more white spaces. A word is formed by the
letters <b>A-Z</b> and <b>a-z</b> and has at most <math>30</math>
letters. The only symbols that appear in the input are the alphabetic
letters and white spaces. There will be a blank line after each
message.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p> For each test case you must print the number of the test case and
each word of the decoded message, one per line (look the sample output
for the exact format). You must print a blank line between each test
case.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
