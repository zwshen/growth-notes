This episode is called…uh…I forgot…oh yeah, “Being Forget ful.”  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Charlize:  You won’t forget that we’re going over to  the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you? 

Pete:  It’s etched in my brain.  I won’t forget. 

Charlize:  It slipped your mind last week that we were m eeting Donna at the movies, remember? 

Pete:  I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forget a bout tomorrow night.   

Charlize:  I’m reminding you because the week before tha t, you forgot to cash that check at the bank.  Remember that? 

Pete:  I didn’t forget.  I was just a little wrapped up in work that week.  I’m not usually absentminded, you know. 

Charlize:  Right.  Do you want me to send you an email tomorrow morning to jog your memory? 

Pete:  That won’t be necessary.  I have the day, time, an d even their address committed to memory.  Do you want to test me?  

 Charlize:  No, I don’t, but I just want to make sure w e don’t have a repeat of what happened last month.  You were supposed to meet me at the Donnelly’s at 8:00 and you never showed up.  Remember that?   

Pete:  No, I don’t.  I have amnesia.  I won’t remembe r any other incident you want to throw in my face.  I thought last week you said you would stop giving me a hard time about my bad memory.  Remember that? 

Charlize:  Uh, no, I don’t.   

Pete:  I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained !

Charlize begins our dialogue – I think this is the fam ous actress Charlize Theron, I’m not sure – by saying, “You won’t forget that we’re  going over to the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?”  “To forget” m eans not to remember something, to have no memory of something.  Charlize is using one of the many ways to ask a question in English, using something called a  “tag” question: “You won’t forget that we’re going over to the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?” 

Pete says, “It’s etched in my brain.”  Something that is “ etched (etched) in your brain” means that you have memorized it, you have permane ntly written it down in your mind so that you cannot possibly forget it.  Somet imes we use that expression for very happy things, sometimes for very sad thing s.  Pete says, “I won’t forget.”  Charlize responds, “It slipped your min d last week that we were meeting Donna at the movies, remember?”  “To slip (slip ) your mind” means to forget something, not to remember something: John said,  “I was supposed to get married this afternoon but it slipped my mind, just for got all about it!” 

Pete says, “I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forge t about tomorrow night.”  “To be preoccupied” means to be worried about  something else, to be thinking about something else; we might also say “to be distracted.”  Charlize says, “I’m reminding you because the week before that (mea ning two weeks ago), you forgot to cash that check at the bank.”  “To re mind (someone)” means to help someone remember something, to remember to do  something by telling them, perhaps over and over, or sending them an email:  don’t forget to do this. Charlize is reminding Pete because he forgot to cash a ch eck at the bank.  “To  

 cash a check” means to go into a bank with a piece of pape r called a “check,” give it to the person working at the bank, and in exchang e they give you back money.   

Charlize mentions how Pete forgot to cash this check two w eeks ago, and then asks him, “Remember that (do you remember)?”  Pete says, “I didn’t forget.  I was just a little wrapped up in work that week.”  “To b e wrapped (wrapped) up in (something)” means to be very busy with something, to b e very involved in a certain task – a certain thing that you are doing.  The word “wrap” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Lear ning Guide for some more information.  Pete says, “I’m not usually absentminded, you know.”  “To be absentminded” (one word) means to be forgetful, to b e easily distracted, not to be able to remember things.  There’s an old expression a bout the absentminded professor, the idea is that university professors are so busy w ith their intellectual tasks that they forget to do basic things like get their car  washed or buy food to make dinner.  That would be an absentminded professor.  

Well, here Pete is saying that he is not absentminded.  Actually, he says, “I’m not usually absentminded, you know.”  Charlize says, “Right.”  She says, “Right,” which would normally mean I agree with you, but when yo u say it a certain way it means the opposite: I don’t believe you, I don’t agree  with you.  Often people will say, “Yeah, right,” that means I don’t believe you.  So  Charlize says, “Right,” she doesn’t believe him, then asks him, “Do you want me to sen d you an email tomorrow morning to jog (jog) your memory?”  “To jog  (someone’s) memory” means to remind someone of something, to help someone r emember something. If you are going out early tomorrow morning and you do n’t want to forget your lunch, you may put a little note on the door that says “b ring lunch.”  That note will jog your memory; it will remind you of what you are sup posed to do. 

Charlize is offering to send Pete an email to jog his m emory about their dinner at the Wong’s tomorrow night.  Pete says, “That won’t be n ecessary (no, you do not need to do that).  I have the day, time, and even the ir address committed to memory.”  When we say something is “committed to memory,”  it’s similar to the previous expression “etched in my brain.”  It means you’ve me morized it, you know it so well you can repeat it without even looking a t it.  Most Americans have committed to memory, for example, certain patriotic son gs.  Because they’ve heard them so often, they know them, we would say, “by he art,” they have the memorized.  Pete then asks Charlize, “Do you want to test  me (do you want me to answer questions so that I can prove that I know)?” 

 Charlize says, “No, I don’t, but I just want to make sure we don’t have a repeat of what happened last month.”  A “repeat of (something) ” is when something happens again, just like it did before.  We would also use the word “recurrence.” It “occurs,” or it happens, again.  Charlize says, “You w ere supposed to meet me at the Donnelly’s at 8:00 and you never showed up.”  Pe te was supposed to meet Charlize at the Donnelly’s.  Notice if we’re talking ab out someone’s house, especially a family in a house, we’ll often use the form  “the” and the name of the person with an “s” at the end: “We’re going over to t he McQuillan’s.”  We’re going over to the McQuillan house, the house that belongs to t he family named McQuillan.  There is an apostrophe before the “s,” so it  would be “McQuillan’ (apostrophe),” which is like a little comma, but up above  the word, and then the “s.”  It indicates possession; we’re really saying the McQuill an’s house. 

Pete was supposed to show up, but didn’t.  He never show ed up.  “To show up” is a phrasal verb meaning to arrive at a particular pl ace at a particular time, to go somewhere when you are expected.  “My friend told me tha t we would meet at the café at 3:00, but I waited for an hour and she n ever showed up.”  “Show” has many different meanings, including other phrasal verbs.  You can get more information in this episode’s Learning Guide. 

Charlize says, “Remember that?”  Pete says, “No, I don’t.  I have amnesia (amnesia).”  “Amnesia” is a medical condition where you c an’t remember what happened during a certain period of time.  Usually th is is because you were hit on the head or had a very frightening experience.  You might forget everything; you might even forget who you are and where you live.  T hat would be a serious case of amnesia.  Pete says, “I don’t remember because I h ave amnesia.”  He’s probably joking, of course.  He then says, “I won’t remem ber any other incident (any other event, anything else that happened) you want to throw in my face.”  “I won’t remember any other (any additional) incident you  want to throw in my face (or that you will throw in my face).”  “To throw (somet hing) in (someone’s) face” means to remind someone of something, especially if it’s something that the person wants to forget but you keep reminding them.  Us ually it’s something bad that happened or something that someone did wrong.  T hey made a mistake, and you keep throwing that mistake in their face; you kee p reminding them. That’s what Pete thinks Charlize is doing; he says, “I tho ught last week you (Charlize) said you would stop giving me a hard time ab out my bad memory.” “To give (someone) a hard time” means to do or say thing s that make the other person feel uncomfortable, to make a joke about them.  We would also used the verb, here, “to tease” (tease), to make jokes about somet hing that someone did wrong.    

 Pete says, “Remember that (remember when you said you wer en’t going to give me a hard time)?”  Charlize says, “Uh, no, I don’t.”  Pete then says, “I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained!”  “To be scatterbr ained” is similar to “to be absentminded,” you’re unable to focus, you’re easily distr acted, you are constantly forgetting things.  That would be someone who  is scatterbrained. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Charlize:  You won’t forget that we’re going over to  the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?

Charlize:  Right.  Do you want me to send you an email tomorrow morning to jog your memory?

Pete:  I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained !
