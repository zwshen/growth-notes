<p class="jbfont">Many of you have probably had some contact with cryptography 
(don't worry if you haven't, though, no deep knowledge of cryptography is needed 
here). In this problem, we will concern ourselves with an encryption scheme 
consisting of a composition of two different ciphers, a so called <i>permutation 
cipher</i>, and a so called <i>substitution cipher</i>.<br>
<br>
In a permutation cipher of block length <b>n</b>, we choose as a secret key a 
permutation <b>&#960; = &#960;<sub>1</sub>&#960;<sub>2</sub> . . . &#960;<sub>n</sub></b> of the 
integers 1 to <b>n</b>. We then encrypt a block of <b>n</b> symbols by permuting them 
according to <b>&#960;</b>, i.e. the encryption of<br>
<b>a = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub> . . . a<sub>n</sub></b> would be <b>a<sub>&#960;1</sub> 
a<sub>&#960;2</sub> . . . a<sub>&#960;n</sub></b> .<br>
<br>
The substitution cipher, on the other hand, concerns itself with the alphabet of 
the symbols we use to encode a message. Let the size of the alphabet be <b>m</b>, 
and assume without loss of generality that the <b>m</b> symbols of the alphabet 
are the integers 1 to <b>m</b>. We then choose a permutation <b>&#964; = &#964;<sub>1</sub>&#964;<sub>2</sub> 
. . . &#964;<sub>m</sub></b> of the alphabet, and simply encrypt a symbol <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> 
by <b>&#964;<sub>ai</sub></b> , i.e. we substitute each symbol according to the 
permutation <b>&#964;</b>.<br>
<br>
Composing these two ciphers is straight-forward; simply do both the permutation 
of the symbols according to <b>&#960;</b>, and the substitution of the symbols 
according to<b> &#964;</b>. Breaking this combined cipher is usually (slightly) more 
difficult than breaking either one of the two simpler ciphers.<br>
<br>
Peter is a clever kid with a very limited memory, and he would like to have the 
combined strength of these two ciphers while only having to remember one 
permutation as his secret key, rather than two. He has realised that the two 
different steps are (in some vague sense) independent, and has thus gotten the 
idea to consider the special case of the above scheme where <b>n = m</b>, and <b>
&#964; = &#960;<sup>-1</sup></b> (the inverse of <b>&#960;</b>; simply choosing <b>&#964; = &#960;</b> 
seems too risky, even for Peter). This way, he only has one permutation to 
remember, while still getting both the permutation step and the substitution 
step.<br>
<br>
As an example, consider using <b>n = m = </b>5, and the permutation <b>&#960; </b>= 4 
2 1 3 5. The inverse <b>&#964;</b> of <b>&#960;</b> is 3 2 4 1 5. Take the message block 2 
5 3 4 2. Applying the permutation cipher (with secret key <b>&#960;</b>) transforms 
the message to 4 5 2 3 2, and applying the substitution cipher (with secret key
<b>&#964;</b>) gives 1 5 2 4 2, which is the encryption of the message 2 5 3 4 2 
using Peter’s scheme (with secret key <b>&#960;</b> = 4 2 1 3 5).<br>
<br>
However, you, being an even more clever kid than Peter, doubt the security of 
Peter’s new scheme, and as a step in investigating this, you should write a 
program which, given an encrypted block, determines the number of possible 
inputs which could have been encrypted to that block (assuming that any key is 
possible).</p>
<p class="bigfont">Input</p>
<p class="jbfont">Input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins 
with an integer 1 &#8804; <b>n </b>&#8804; 50, denoting both the length of an input block 
and the size of the alphabet. Then follows a line containing <b>n</b> integers 
between 1 and <b>n</b>, representing the encryption of some input block.<br>
<br>
Input is terminated by a case where <b>n</b> = 0.</p>
<p class="bigfont">Output</p>
<p class="jbfont">For each test case, output a line containing the number of 
different inputs that could have been used. You may assume that the answer will 
fit in a 64-bit signed integer.</p>
