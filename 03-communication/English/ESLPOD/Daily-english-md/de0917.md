This episode is a dialog between Patricia and Ed ab out some of the names and terms we use in describing family members. Let's ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party. I got some nametags with “father,” “mother,” and “kids” p rinted on them, with a space for people to write their names. It’ll be easier for people to introduce themselves and make friends.

Ed: The nametags are a good idea, but we have to ke ep in mind that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families . We won’t just have nuclear or traditional families coming.

Patricia: I don’t see how that makes a difference.

Ed: Don’t you? What if we have same-sex families? W e need to be ready to hand out two “father” or two “mother” nametags. There ar e also a lot of stepfamilies with more than one set of parents.

Patricia: Well, the men are all “fathers” and the “ women” are all mothers – that’s simple. I still don’t see the problem.

Ed: What if the children are being raised by grandp arents? Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women grandmo thers.

Patricia: Okay, we might have some of those familie s.

Ed: And don’t forget that some parents are divorced  or are single parents. Their current partner may not be their spouse. It wouldn’ t be appropriate to give them

“father” or “mother” nametags. We might even get fo ster families, in which case, the nametags may not be applicable at all.

Patricia: I give up. Forget I ever brought up these  nametags. I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them.

Ed: That’s a good idea. Given the complexity we liv e in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go!

Patricia begins our dialog by saying to Ed, “Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party.” Apparently they're hav ing a party for the people who live around their house, in their neighborhood. Pat ricia says, “I got some nametags with ‘father,’ ‘mother,’ and ‘kids’ printe d on them with a space for people to write their names.” A “nametag” (nametag)  is usually a small piece of paper, or something that you write on that has your  name. You usually put it on your shirt at a party where perhaps people aren’t g oing to know each other, and so this helps people know what other people's names  are. This is very common at large events, such as conferences and convention s.

Patricia is not having a convention. She’s just hav ing a neighborhood party, and she wants these nametags to say “father,” “mother” and “kids.” Ed says, “The nametags are a good idea.” He likes that idea, “but ,” he says, “we have to keep in mind” – we have to remember – “that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families.” “In this day and age” mea ns nowadays, in the current period, or we might even say, “in modern times.” Us ually, we use this phrase when we’re about to talk about something that has c hanged in society, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

Ed says, “There are a lot of unconventional familie s.” “Conventional” (conventional) means traditional, normal, expected – what you would expect in this situation. “Unconventional” means not  conventional, something you wouldn't normally expect in a situation. Ed uses this adject ive to describe families nowadays. The traditional family, the conventional family, was always a father, a mother, and child or children. Now we have “unconve ntional families,” and that's what we're talking about here in this dialog.

Ed says, “We won't just have nuclear or traditional  families coming.” The “nuclear family” refers traditionally to the father, the mot her, and the children. It's the traditional family, the family that has been most c ommon in the last, I don't know,

,000 years. Ed says that “we will not just have t hose kinds of traditional families coming to the party.”

Patricia says, “I don't see how that makes a differ ence.” I don't see why that is important. Ed says, “Don't you?” He’s surprised tha t she doesn't. “What if we have same-sex families?” One of the more recent cha nges in some countries, in Europe and parts of the United States, has been for  the government to recognize marriage as being not just between a man and a woma n, but possibly between two men or two women. This is obviously very contro versial. A lot of people don't like this change, but it is a change that has taken  place, and so we need to know how to describe it. And when you read about it, usu ally, the phrase that you will see will be “same-sex.” A “same-sex couple” would b e two people who are of the same sex – two men or two women. So, a “same-sex fa mily” would not be a family where everyone is the same sex. You might ex pect that, but instead it means that the leaders of the family are both of the same sex. The children, of course, could be of different sexes.

Ed says, “We need to be ready to hand out” – or to give – “two father or two mother nametags.” Again the traditional use of the word “father” and “mother” refer to their biological functions. You can only h ave one father, and one mother, but here we're using the term more loosely to descr ibe two heads of the family, neither of which could be (potentially) the biologi cal father or mother.

Ed says, “There are a lot of stepfamilies with more  than one set of parents.” A “stepfamily” is a family where the mother or the fa ther has married again to another person, who is not the mother or father of their children. So, a mother and a father get married. They have a child. They g et divorced, and the mother remarries another man, and that man legally becomes  the father of the children. We would call him the “stepfather.” So, a stepfamil y is a family that either the parents divorced and remarried – one of the parents  divorced and remarried – or perhaps the person was never married before, had a child (the woman) and then married. That might also be a stepfamily.

Patricia says, “Well, the men are all fathers and t he women are all mothers – that's simple.” Of course, that's not true in a bio logical sense. Patricia says, “I still don't see the problem.” I still don't understand wh at the problem is.

Ed says, “What if the children are being raised” – are being brought up – “by grandparents?” “Your grandparents” are the mother a nd father of your mother and father. So, your mother has two parents, your f ather has two parents – those are your “grandparents.” Ed says, “Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women, grandmothers.”

 Patricia says, “Okay, we might have some of those f amilies.” Ed also says that there could be some parents who come who are divorc ed, or who are single parents. “To be divorced” means that you legally en d your marriage. The person that you said you were going to live with until you  die…well, you don't. You get divorced and then you can go out and find a new per son that you will live with until you die.

Ed says that there will be divorced parents and sin gle parents. A “single parent” would be a man or a woman who is raising his child or his children by himself, or herself, without the help of the other parent. Sing le-parent families are typically women who have children without getting married, bu t it could also be a man who has a child with another woman and the woman le aves, or dies, or something, and the father raises the child. There a re all sorts of possibilities in modern life, and that is one of them.

Ed continues, “Their” – meaning the parent who is d ivorced or who is a single parent – “current partner may not be their spouse.”  Your “partner” (partner) is a very general term to describe someone with whom you  are in a romantic relationship. It could be a girlfriend. It could be  a boyfriend. It could be a husband. It could be a wife. The term could apply t o any of those cases.

Ed says, the current partner of the single parent o r divorced parent may not be their spouse. The word “spouse” (spouse) refers to someone's husband or wife. You have to be married to have a spouse, but you do n't have to be married to have a partner. Generally speaking, when someone in troduces you to their “partner,” they are not talking about their spouse.  They could be, but if the person is married, you would just say, “Well, this is my h usband,” or “This is my wife,” or, “This is my spouse.” You probably wouldn't call the m “partner.” “Partner” is just a term that has been used in the last 20, 30 years or  so because there are so many people who are involved in romantic relationsh ips who are not married.

Ed says, “It wouldn't be appropriate to give these people ‘father’ or ‘mother’ nametags. We might even get foster families, in whi ch case the nametags may not be applicable at all.” A “foster (foster) famil y” is a family where the children aren’t legally the children of the two parents or t he parent that is taking care of them. What happens is that, unhappily, in some fami lies, the parents are not able to or unwilling to take care of their children, and  so the government takes the children from the families and gives them to other parents who take care of them. They don't legally become the children of those “fo ster parents,” as we call them, but they are raised by them. They are helped by the m.

Ed says, “We might even get foster families, in whi ch case, the nametags may not be applicable at all.” “In which case” means in  that situation, or under those circumstances. “Applicable” means that it applies t o them, that it is appropriate for them. If they’re foster parents, then the terms  “mother” and “father” may not be considered appropriate for them.

Patricia says, “I give up.” When someone says “I gi ve up,” they mean, “I'm not going to try anymore,” usually because something is  too difficult for you to do. Patricia says, “Forget I ever brought up these name tags.” “To bring up” here, as a phrasal verb, means to begin to talk about someth ing, to mention something. Patricia is saying, “Just forget I even started tal king about nametags.” “I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them” – blank.” “Blank” (blank) means nothing is written on the piece of paper. The piece of paper, or possibly the screen on your computer, is empty. We would say it is “blank.” “Bl ank” is normally used for talking about pieces of paper, however.

Ed says, “That's a good idea. Given the complexity we live in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go.” “Complexity” an d “simplicity” are opposite ideas. “Complexity” refers to how difficult or comp licated something is. “Simplicity” refers to how easy to understand, or h ow easy to control, a situation is. “Simplicity” comes from the word “simple.” “Com plexity” comes from the word “complex.” These are opposite ideas.

Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
