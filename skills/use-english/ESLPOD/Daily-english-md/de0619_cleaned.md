This episode is called “Packing Clothes for a Trip.”  It’s a dialogue between Nick and Mariah using vocabulary you would associate with trave l and clothing.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Nick:  Aren’t you done packing yet?  We need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes. 

Mariah:  I’m almost done.  I just need to finish packing  my garment bag.   

Nick:  You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for? 

Mariah:  For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles in them.  I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessorie s; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for m y makeup and toiletries.   

Nick:  What do you need all that for?! 

Mariah:  I’m preparing for all contingencies.  You neve r know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped wit h anything I’ll need.   

Nick:  I should have expected this when I married a clothe s horse.  I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe. 

 Mariah:  I was thinking about it.  I’m sure I can make r oom.  All of my bags are expandable.

Nick asks Mariah, “Aren’t you done packing yet?”  “Aren’t you done” meaning aren’t you finished packing yet.  “To pack” (pack) means to  put things in a box or a bag or a suitcase – which you could also call luggage – especially for traveling. So if you are going on a trip, you need to put clothi ng and other things in some sort of bag or suitcase so that you can carry it.  Nick says, “We  need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes (we need to go to the airp ort in 15 minutes).” 

Mariah says, “I’m almost done (I’m almost finished).  I just need to finish packing my garment bag.”  A “garment” (garment) is, in the ge neral sense, a piece of clothing, something you wear.  Here, “garment bag” is a special kind of suitcase that is used for dresses or formal jackets that a man or a woman might wear. The top of the garment bag has a “hangar,” which is t hat y-shaped thing you put your clothes on when you put them in a closet for example .  So, a garment bag is used for transporting your clothes so they don’t get all wrinkled in the suitcase. We’re going to talk about “wrinkled” in a moment.   

Nick says, “You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for?” m eaning why.  Mariah explains, “For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles (wrinkles) in them.”  A “wrinkle” as a noun, or the verb “to wrin kle,” means in this case to have these lines – thin lines in the material of the clo thing when it isn’t put into the suitcase properly.  When, for example, you would take a shirt and instead of folding it, that is instead of making it smaller and fl at in a neat way, you would take it and just roll it up in a ball and throw it in  your suitcase.  Well, that’s going to result in wrinkles.  So, it’s when your clothing isn’t straight or flat.  “Wrinkle” has a couple of different meanings, and those can be fou nd in the Learning Guide. 

Mariah is taking a garment bag so her dresses don’t get w rinkles in them.  She says, “I have a bag for shoes (what she wears on her fee t), belts,” a long piece of leather or fabric that you put around your waist, usual ly to hold up your pants.  So a man would have a belt; I wear a belt with my pants so  they don’t fall down – that would be embarrassing!  “Belt” has a couple of dif ferent meanings, and those, once again, are in the Learning Guide.  So, M ariah has a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessories.  A “handbag” (han dbag – one word) is also called a “purse.”  It’s a bag that a woman has in h er hand or over her shoulder that she puts her money and her wallet and her  makeup and all sorts of  

 mysterious things that men never understand.  That’s called  a handbag. “Accessories” are anything you wear in addition to your basi c clothing (a shirt, pants, a dress), anything extra that makes you, perhaps, loo k more beautiful. Never makes me look more beautiful!  It’s not necessarily a  piece of clothing.  It could be the belt, it could be a hat, it could be a p iece of jewelry.  All of these are possible accessories.   

Mariah says she’s also bringing two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks.  A “suitcase” is the same as luggage.  We talked a bout a suitcase in the first sentence of the dialogue.  “Swimsuits” are clot hing that you wear while you go swimming.  For a man, it’s usually just a pair of shorts.  For a woman it could be either a one-piece or a two-piece swimsuit; the  two-piece is usually called a bikini.  There’s a part on the top and then t here’s a part around the bottom.  A one-piece swimsuit is just one piece of mate rial that is not broken or separated in the middle.  So you can’t see the woman’s st omach in a one-piece swimsuit, and in a two-piece swimsuit you can – even if you  don’t want to! 

Underwear is also something Mariah is bringing.  “Under wear” is what you wear underneath your shorts or pants or dress that covers the bot tom middle.  It covers all of those things that you should keep covered in pu blic!  “Underwear” actually has a broader meaning; it’s not just what you wo uld put on underneath your shorts or dress.  It could also refer to things that yo u would put on your breasts if you are a woman – bras, that is.  It also inclu des just about any kind of clothing you put on underneath another piece of clothi ng.  So a T-shirt, a plain white shirt that you might put on underneath a more f ormal shirt, that would also be considered underwear. 

Finally, Mariah says that she has a carry-on (carry-on) fo r her makeup and toiletries.  A “carry-on” is a small piece of luggage –  a small bag or suitcase – that you can take onto the plane with you.  That is, you don’t have to put it underneath the plane.  When you put luggage undernea th the plane, we say that you have “checked” your luggage.  A carry-on is a bag or a su itcase that you take with you to your seat, putting it either above you or in front of you underneath the seat in front of you.  “Makeup” is what typically women pu t on their faces to make them more beautiful.  “Toiletries” (toiletries) refer s to things that you would use to clean yourself – soap.  It might also include toothpaste.   It might include creams and lotions, other liquid things, typically, that you pu t on your face or body for cleansing or to make them look better. 

Nick says, “What do you need all that for (why do you need  all of those things)?!” Mariah says, “I’m preparing for all contingencies.”  A “ contingency” (contingency)  

 is a dangerous, difficult situation that might happen i n the future, something you need to be prepared for.  Here in Southern Californ ia we have to be prepared for the contingency of an earthquake, it could happen in th e future.  Mariah is preparing for all contingencies, all the things that cou ld go wrong.  She says, “You never know what situation you’ll be in when you tr avel, and I want to be equipped with anything I’ll need.”  “To be equipped”  (equipped) means to have all the necessary things, supplies and tools, for example, that  you need for a particular situation.  We might even say you are “well e quipped.”  Sometimes we use that expression in talking about the capabilities, in tellectual for example, of someone.  It might even refer to training or education  they have received.  We hope the lawyer is well equipped to defend a man accused  of, or said to have committed, a murder. 

Nick says, “I should have expected this when I married a cloth es horse.”  A “clothes horse,” like the animal, (two words) is a person  who likes clothing and has too much clothing.  It’s definitely usually a negative way of describing someone.  Nick says, “I’m surprised you didn’t bring your ent ire wardrobe.”  In this case, “wardrobe” (wardrobe) refers to all of your cl othes, all of shoes, all of your accessories.  Everything related to clothing that you ow n, that is your wardrobe.  Someone might say, “When I get a new job I ’m going to have to buy a whole new wardrobe,” meaning all of my clothes need to  be different. 

Mariah says, “I was thinking about it (I was thinking abo ut bringing my entire wardrobe she means).  I’m sure I can make room.”  “To make room” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to arrange, to put things in  a certain area so that you have enough space for something else.  You could also ma ke room for a person, for example, in a crowded elevator.  Mariah says that a ll of her bags are expandable.  “Expandable” means you are able to increase  something in size.  It comes from the verb “to expand,” which means to make bigg er. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Nick:  Aren’t you done packing yet?  We need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes. 

Mariah:  I’m almost done.  I just need to finish packing  my garment bag.   

Nick:  You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for? 

 Mariah:  For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles in them.  I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessorie s; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for m y makeup and toiletries.   

Nick:  What do you need all that for?! 

Mariah:  I’m preparing for all contingencies.  You neve r know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped wit h anything I’ll need.   

Nick:  I should have expected this when I married a clothe s horse.  I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe. 

Mariah:  I was thinking about it.  I’m sure I can make r oom.  All of my bags are expandable.
