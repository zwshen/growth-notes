This episode is a dialogue about proofreading a doc ument – going through something you write to make sure that there aren’t any mistakes in it. Well, let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russell: Hey, LeeAnn, you were an English major, ri ght?

LeeAnn: Yes.

Russell: Could you proofread this for me?

LeeAnn: I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for structure?

Russell: For everything.

LeeAnn: So you’re asking me to fact-check all of the facts and figures and to parse each line to find any spelling, grammar, or p unctuation errors.

Russell: That’s right. I used the spell-check on it , but some typos may have slipped through. I wouldn’t be surprised if it were  riddled with other errors, too.

LeeAnn: Right. What about the formatting?

Russell: Check that, too. You can edit out the erro rs as you go along.

LeeAnn: You want me to proofread and  edit it?

Russell: Sure, if you don’t mind.

LeeAnn: You do realize that this is a 400-page docu ment, right?

Russell: Is there a problem?

Russell begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey LeeAnn,  you were an English major, right?” An “English major” is someone who majored i n, or specialized in, a certain topic in college. I was a Spanish and history major . Those were the areas that I studied in-depth when I went to college, when I was  at the university. Usually we talk about “major” when we’re talking about someone ’s undergraduate degree, someone’s bachelor’s degree. So, if someone says, “ I was a psychology major,” he means he studied psychology in college. That was  the area that he specialized in.

LeeAnn answers Russell’s question by saying, “Yes,”  meaning yes, I was an English major. Russell says, “Could you proofread t his for me?” “To proofread” (proofread) a document means to look at it to make sure there are no errors, or to find the errors so that someone else can fix the m. LeeAnn says, “I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for struc ture?”

“Content” here refers to the ideas and the words us ed to present information. “Structure” (structure) refers to how the document is organized. “Content” usually refers to the message that you are trying to commun icate, the ideas of your document. “Structure” refers to how the document is  organized. Russell says, “For everything,” meaning for both content and stru cture. LeeAnn then says, “So, you are asking me to fact-check all of the facts an d figures and to parse each line for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.”

“To fact-check” means to make sure that everything that you say in a document is true, to research whether the things that you sa y are in fact correct. So, for example, if I’m talking about the history of the Un ited States and I’m giving certain information about the presidents, someone w ho is fact-checking my article would have to go back and make sure that wh at I say about each president is correct – that I have their names corr ect, and the dates of birth correct, and so forth.

“Facts and figures” (figures) is an expression mean ing the information that you present in a document, often including numbers. “Fi gures” is another word for numbers, such as statistics in a table or a graph. So, “facts and figures” means

the specific details, including numbers and other s tatistical information, that might be in your document. LeeAnn mentions “parsing each line to find any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.”

The verb “to parse” (parse) here means to analyze s omething by taking a whole and breaking it down into its parts. Normally “to p arse” is used to mean to analyze a sentence into its different syntactical f unctions: this is a verb, this is a noun, and so forth. But here, LeeAnn is using it in  a more general way to mean to look at something and examine each of its parts. the parts here would be the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of this document .

“Spelling,” of course, refers to making sure that t he letters you use are in the correct order and are the correct letters. English spelling can be very difficult for someone who doesn’t read a lot. The word “to,” for example, could be spelled (to), (too), or (two), depending on which meaning y ou are trying to communicate.

“Grammar” (grammar) is something you’re probably al ready familiar with – it’s the structure of language, the rules that are typically  followed when using a language. “Punctuation” refers to the use of period s, commas, apostrophes, colons, and other marks that you see in the written  form of a language that help you understand it better.

Russell says, “That’s right. I used the spell-check  on it, but some typos may have slipped through.” “Spell-check” is a function that is found in many word processing programs, including Microsoft Word, that  helps you identify words that were spelled incorrectly. A “typo” (typo) is a word  that was misspelled or a word that has some mistake in it that was accidental. It  wasn’t because the person writing it didn’t know the correct way of, say, spe lling the word, but rather that he accidentally put down the wrong letters and therefo re created a word that was misspelled.

“To slip (slip) through” means to not be noticed, e specially something that is an error, a mistake. Sometimes there are errors that s lip through our editors – mistakes that we don’t find, we don’t notice. We wo uld use the verb “catch.” “We didn’t catch the mistakes. We didn’t catch the erro rs.” Russell says, “I wouldn’t be surprised if it were riddled with other errors, too .” If something is “riddled (riddled) with” something, it has a lot of that something tha t you don’t want. If something is “riddled with errors,” it is full of errors. It has  lots of mistakes in it.

LeeAnn says, “Right. What about formatting?” “Forma tting” (formatting) refers to the way that something is arranged on the page. If you are creating a document in a word processing program like Word, you have to  select the font – the way

that the letters look – the size of the letters, an d so forth. This is all part of the formatting. Russell says, “Check that too,” meaning  yes, look at the formatting when you proofread the paper.

He then says, “You can edit out the errors as you g o along.” “To edit (edit) out” something means to identify them and remove them – in this case, to find the mistakes and correct them. LeeAnn then says, “You w ant me to proofread and edit it?” Russell says, “Sure, if you don’t mind.” “If you don’t mind” means if that’s okay with you.

LeeAnn says, “You do realize that this is a 400-pag e document, right?” The word “document” that I have been using throughout my exp lanation here means written materials that have information about somet hing. A document is anything that contains information that is written either in  electronic form or in paper form. Notice that LeeAnn says, “You do realize.” “Sometim es we add the verb “do” even though we could just say “you realize.” The “d o” gives emphasis to the verb. It gives emphasis to the idea.

For example, if your friend says to you, “I’m going  to ask that girl sitting at the next table for her telephone number,” and you know this girl already has a boyfriend, you could say, “You do know that she has  a boyfriend, right?” You could’ve just said, “You know she has a boyfriend, right?” But the use of the verb “do” there is to emphasize – to put stress, if you will, on the meaning of the verb. LeeAnn then says, “You do realize that this is a 40 0-page document, right?

Russell then says, “Is there a problem?” “Is there a problem?” means “Is there something wrong with that?” Of course, Russell is a sking LeeAnn to do a lot of work, and we’re not sure if Russell is actually goi ng to pay LeeAnn anything to do that work. It doesn’t sound like it from the dialog ue. If I were LeeAnn, I’d probably say no.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Our dialogues are not riddled with errors in Englis h, we hope, because they’re written by the greatest scriptwriter on the Interne t – our very own Dr. Lucy Tse.
