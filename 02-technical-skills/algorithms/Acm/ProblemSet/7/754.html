<P>
Archeologists from the Antiquities and Curios Museum (ACM) have flown to Egypt to examine the
great pyramid of Key-Ops. Using state-of-the-art technology they are able to determine that the lower
floor of the pyramid is constructed from a series of straightline walls, which intersect to form numerous
enclosed chambers. Currently, no doors exist to allow access to any chamber. This state-of-the-art
technology has also pinpointed the location of the treasure room. What these dedicated (and greedy)
archeologists want to do is blast doors through the walls to get to the treasure room. However, to
minimize the damage to the artwork in the intervening chambers (and stay under their government
grant for dynamite) they want to blast through the minimum number of doors. For structural integrity
purposes, doors should only be blasted at the midpoint of the wall of the room being entered. You are
to write a program which determines this minimum number of doors.

The input will consist of several cases.The first line of the input contains the number of cases, and it's followed bya blank line.

<p>The first line of each case will be an integer <I>n</I> (

walls of the pyramid have fixed endpoints at (0,0), (0,100), (100,100) and (100,0) and are <EM>not</EM> included
in the list of walls. The interior walls always span from one exterior wall to another exterior wall and
are arranged such that no more than two walls intersect at any point. You may assume that no two
given walls coincide. After the listing of the interior walls there will be one final line containing the
floating point coordinates of the treasure in the treasure room (guaranteed not to lie on a wall).

<P>Different cases are separated by a blank line.
