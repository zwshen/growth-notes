<h2><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000">Problem</a>
</h2>
<p>
Corporation XPTO has developed a catchy new gizmo it expects to sale in
large numbers.
However its quality assurance department found out a major fault with
the new product, named <span class="textit">WonderGizmo</span>, which
will lead to high
complaint and return rates.
When exposed to direct moon light it will break!
</p>
<p>XTPO's CEO decided to compare the cost of redesigning
<span class="textit">WonderGizmo</span> with the cost of replacing
faulty products, and put
you in charge of developing a tool for calculating the amount of units
that will have to be fixed or replaced during a period of time after
sales begin.
</p>
<p>This is what you were told:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales will begin on a Monday.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="textit">WonderGizmo</span> will sell every day of
the week from 10:00:00 to
18:00:00.
A unit will be sold after every <span class="textit">S</span> seconds
the store is open.
No sales will be conducted after close time.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The Costumer Care Service will have the same schedule but will
only be
open from Monday to Friday.
It will have a staff of <span class="textit">E</span> employees, each
requiring <span class="textit">R</span>
seconds to repair a broken <span class="textit">WonderGizmo</span>.
A unit which would only be fixed after close time, will not be fixed
that day, but left untouched to be fixed the following work day.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Every night, <span class="textit">F</span> percent of the faulty
units in circulation will
break. The number of broken units is the floor of this percentage.
The following morning the owners of the failed units will join the
end of the queue at the Costumer Care Service.
They will either leave with a repaired unit or, should they wait for
three days without being serviced, a new replacement unit.
Replacement will be granted each day at closing time, to every client
who is in its third (or more) day of waiting.
That very same night these costumers will be using their units.
    <p>For instance, a client who joins the queue on Monday morning
will be
given a replacement at Wednesday's closing time if he is still waiting
to be serviced.
However, a client who joins the queue on Thursday may have to wait
until Monday's close time. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Costumer Care Service's fixed units will never again fail.
Replaced units are just like the ones sold to costumers, faulty.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000">Input</a>
</h2>
Your program will receive several test cases separated by a blank line. Each of them contains 5 integer numbers, each on a line of its
own.
The first is the number of seconds between each sale in seconds,
<span class="textit">S</span>.
The second is the numbers of employees repairing <span class="textit">WonderGizmos</span>,
<span class="textit">E</span>.
The third is the number of seconds it takes to repair each unit in
seconds, <span class="textit">R</span>.
The fourth is the percentage of faulty units in circulation that will
fail each night, <span class="textit">F</span>, which will be a number
between 1 and 99.
The fifth number is the number of selling days for which the results
must be known.
<p></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">Output</a>
</h2>
<p>
The output for each test case consists of four lines, each with an integer number.
The first line will indicate the number of replaced units.
The second line will indicate the number of repaired units.
The third line will indicate the number of faulty units in
circulation.
The last line represents the length of the queue at the Costumer Care
Service.
</p>
<p>The program will give the results at shop closing time of the last
day. Print a blank line between test cases.
