<P>
In response to overwhelming customer complaints, the Fifth Bank of Swamp County
has finally decided to produce a listing of cleared checks at the end of each
customer's checking account statement.  The current statements list only the
transaction history, sorted by date, which includes all deposits, withdrawals
and fee assessments in addition to cleared checks.  The code to generate the
current statements was written by programmers with degrees in math; these
programmers have for years argued that all ''necessary and sufficient''
information is contained in the transaction history, and any further output is
unnecessary and wasteful.  In order to minimize the cost of the software
change, the bank has laid off the entire programming staff and has chosen
instead to outsource the job to part-time student labor as a weekend
project.
<P>
<P>
The cleared check summary will list all checks which cleared the bank during
the statement reporting period.  The summary will be sorted in ascending order
by check number, and will report the dollar amount of the check and date the 
check cleared.  To improve the usefulness of the list, any
out-of-sequence check numbers should have an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) printed next to
them.  An out-of-sequence check number is one which, when sorted, does not
immediately succeed the previously cleared check number.
<P>

<P>
The first line of the input will contain an integer N indicating the number of
test case you need to test followed by a blank line.. Then there N set of test case. For each test
input&nbsp; to the check summary program consists of a check transaction history,
sorted in ascending order by date.  There will be one input line for each
check, consisting of the transaction date in <EM>yy/mm/dd</EM> format, white space, the check number (an integer between 1 and 9999), white space, and the amount
of the check in dollars and cents.<P>Consecutive test cases will separated by
one blank line.
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The output for each test case should be displayed in three columns, with all checks sorted in
column order (see the sample output).  Do not print any more rows than
necessary, and always fill the middle column before spilling over to the
last column.  Each column should be separated from the others by three spaces
and have the following format:
<P>
<PRE>nnnn* dddddd.cc yy/mm/dd</PRE>
<P>
where ``<TT>nnnn</TT>'' is the check number with leading zeroes suppressed, ``<TT>*</TT>'' is the optional out-of-sequence indicator (use a space if in sequence), 
and  ``<TT>dddddd.cc</TT>'' is the dollar and cent value of the check, with leading zeroes suppressed.  If the check is for less than one dollar, print a zero before the decimal point.
All checks for $1 million or more require special processing and are not
handled through the bank's normal check clearing process; such checks will not
appear on these statements.
<P>
Consecutive output is separated by single blank line.
