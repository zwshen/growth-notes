This episode is a dialogue between Jack and Claire about doing something called “pro bono” work, where you basically volunte er some of your time to a community organization to do the kind of work that normally you get paid to do. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: Welcome to the firm. Are you getting the ha ng of things here?

Jack: I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt. But let me ask you o ne thing: Is the firm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro b ono work each month?

Claire: It is. This firm takes community service ve ry seriously. Everyone does pro bono work, and everybody is expected to hit the tar get of 60 hours each year.

Jack: This is so different from my previous firm. T here, everything was about billable hours. Nobody cared about anything but how  many hours we could rack up with each client.

Claire: Billable hours are important here, too, but  we bill ourselves as the firm with a social conscience. That’s what sets us apart  from our competitors. If you fall short of your expected pro bono hours, believe  me, you’ll hear about it.

Jack: It’s refreshing to work for a firm that’s not  all about the bottom line.

Claire: Don’t get carried away. This firm is still here to make money. It’s just not 100 percent of its focus.

Jack: Maybe just 98 percent?

Claire: That’s right. And in this industry, that’s unheard of.

Our dialogue begins with Claire saying to Jack, “We lcome to the firm.” A “firm” (firm) is another word for a company, usually a com pany that offers what we might call “professional services.” Lawyers, for ex ample, usually call their companies a “firm.” A firm is a group of lawyers wo rking together to steal your money (just kidding).

Claire welcomes Jack to the firm. He’s obviously a new employee at the firm. Claire says, “Are you getting the hang of things he re?” “To get the hang (hang) of” something means to become comfortable doing it,  to learn how to do it. She’s asking Jack if he’s figuring out the way things wor k at this particular law firm.

Jack says, “I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt.” The phrase “un der my belt” (belt) means that you have a certain amount of experience or ski lls, or that you have done something for a certain amount of time. Your “belt”  is the thing that goes around the top of your pants to hold your pants up so they  don’t fall down. But the expression “under my belt” just means that I have t his experience, I’ve done this sort of thing, or I have these kinds of skills.

Jack says, “But let me ask you one thing. Is the fi rm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro bono work each month ?” “Pro (pro) bono (bono)” is doing something that you are normally paid to do for free. So, if you are a doctor and you work at a hospital normally, you might volu nteer on the weekend to work at a clinic for poor people. That would be doing pr o bono work. It’s what you normally get paid to do, but you’re doing it for fr ee.

At Jack and Claire’s law firm, each lawyer is expec ted to do five hours each month of pro bono work. In other words, the company  expects them to volunteer five hours of their time each month. Claire says the company is very serious about this. She says, “The firm takes,” or consider s, “community service very seriously.” “Community service” is time you spend v olunteering to help organizations in your community. “To volunteer” (vo lunteer) is to work without getting paid.

Claire says, “Everyone does pro bono work, and ever ybody is expected to hit the target of 60 hours each year.” “To hit the target” (target) means to meet a goal, to

achieve the amount of something that you are expect ed to achieve. We often use that word “target” in a business setting when we’re  talking about the goals and objectives, especially numerical goals and objectiv es – when you’re supposed to have a certain number of things done or perhaps a c ertain amount sold of your product.

Jack says, “This is so different from my previous f irm. There” – meaning at his previous firm where he used to work – “everything w as about billable hours.” “Billable (billable) hours” is time that you spend working for a customer or a client that you can charge the client for. Lawyers, for ex ample, usually charge by the hour, which means they say, “Well, if it takes me f our hours to do this, then I’m going to charge you $100 an hour” – or $200 hundred  dollars an hour, or $500 hundred dollars an hour.

Billable hours are the hours you work for someone that you can then bill them for – you can then charge them for. The word “bill” (bi ll) refers to a demand for someone to pay you a certain amount. If you go to a  restaurant, they’ll bring you a bill for your dinner. We also call that, in a res taurant, a “check,” but in the general sense, in other business settings, we would  call it a “bill.”

Jack says at his old company, his old firm, “everyt hing was about billable hours,” meaning the only thing that that firm cared about w as how much money you made for the firm. “Nobody cared about anything but  how many hours we could rack up with each client.” “To rack (rack) up” is a  two-word phrasal verb meaning to get a large number of something, to increase the  amount of something. We often use this phrasal verb in a negative sense whe n you are getting too much of something that you don’t want.

You could talk about “racking up too much debt” – h aving too many loans that you need to pay. You could talk about “racking up c redit card bills” – having different credit cards and needing to pay money on those credit cards because you’re using them, of course. So, “rack up” can be a positive thing, or it could be a negative thing. It’s often used in a negative way , although here in this sentence it’s a positive thing.

Claire says, “Billable hours are important here, to o, but we bill ourselves as the firm with a social conscience.” Claire uses the wor d “bill” here as a verb, in a somewhat different way than we just heard a few min utes ago. As a verb, “to bill” can mean to charge someone, but it can also mean to  characterize yourself or advertise yourself in a certain way, and when it’s used that way, it’s usually followed by the word “as.”

“We’re going to bill ourselves as the best company in Los Angeles.” That’s what we’re going to advertise to people. That’s what we’ re going to tell people about ourselves. “He bills himself as the funniest man in  Hollywood.” He considers himself – and he tells other people that he is – the funniest man in Hollywood. Not me. I’m not the funniest man in Hollywood. I do n’t even work in Hollywood, but that’s another story.

Claire says this law firm bills itself as the “firm  with a social conscience.” The term “social conscience” (conscience) refers to rea lizing, knowing, that you are part of a larger community and that you want to try  to help a larger community. A company with a social conscience might, for example , give money to volunteer or charitable organizations in order to help them.

The term “conscience” refers to your ability to rec ognize right and wrong. When we talk about a “social conscience,” we’re talking about being aware of and helping the community around you. It’s especially p opular when talking about businesses nowadays.

Claire says, “That’s what sets us apart from our co mpetitors.” “To set something or someone apart” (apart) means to make yourself un ique, to make yourself better than other people, to separate yourself, or we might say, “to differentiate” yourself – to make yourself different from other pe ople. Your “competitors” (competitors) are the other companies in the same k ind of work that you are, that are trying to get the same clients that you are.

Claire says, “If you fall short of your expected pr o bono hours, believe me, you’ll hear about it.” The expression “to fall short” is a  verb meaning to not do as well as you are expected to do. The phrase “believe me” is used to emphasize that what you are saying to this person is true. You may  say, for example, “Believe me, I understand your problems.” You are assuring the person that you understand them. You are telling them that “what I am telling you is true.”

You could use this in lots of different circumstanc es. Whenever you think the person may not believe you or think that you’re tel ling the truth or are being completely honest, you might use this expression, “ believe me.” “Believe me, I really want to go to this show, but I’m busy at hom e tonight.” Perhaps the person doesn’t believe that you really want to go to this show, so that’s an example of how you would use that particular phrase.

Claire says that “if you fall short of your expecte d pro bono hours, you’ll hear about it.” When someone says, “You’ll hear about it ,” what they really mean is that you are going to be in trouble. Someone is going to yell at you or someone is

going to punish you because you did something wrong . Jack says, “It’s refreshing to work for a firm that’s not all about the bottom line.” “Refreshing” (refreshing) means it’s new, it’s interesting. Perhaps it’s exci ting, even.

Jack says, “It’s refreshing to work for a firm that ’s not all about” – that doesn’t just care about – “the bottom line.” The term “bottom li ne” refers to how much money the company makes, how “profitable,” we might say, the company is. Claire says, “Don’t get carried away.” That expression, “Don’t g et carried away,” means don’t get too excited about something. Don’t take this id ea too far. Don’t exaggerate.

She says, “This firm is still here to make money.” Even though the firm has a social conscience and has its lawyers do pro bono w ork doesn’t mean it doesn’t want to make money. Claire says, “It’s just not 100  percent of its focus.” It’s not what it does 100 percent of the time. Jack then say s, “Maybe just 98 percent?” Claire says, “That’s right. And in this industry, t hat’s unheard of.” If something is “unheard of,” it is not typical. It is not common. It is almost never seen. It’s very rare.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
