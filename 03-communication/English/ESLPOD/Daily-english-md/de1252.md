This episode is a dialogue between Jean-Paul and Ch arlene about someone who says he’s going to do something, who promises to do  something, and then doesn’t. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jean-Paul: What’s going on? I thought it was a done  deal.

Charlene: I think you misunderstood. The last time we talked, I said I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going  to beg off.

Jean-Paul: What you said was that you were agreeabl e to the idea and that we would work out the details later. Now you’re backtr acking?

Charlene: I would never renege on a promise. If I g ave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.

Jean-Paul: I’m really surprised by your denial. I d idn’t have you pegged as someone who backs out of deals.

Charlene: All I can say is that we don’t see eye to  eye. Let’s agree to disagree and leave it at that.

Jean-Paul: That’s easy for you to say. Your failure  to honor your promise is going to put me in a very awkward position.

Charlene: How’s that? We only spoke yesterday.

Jean-Paul: I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.

 Charlene: May I make a suggestion?

Jean-Paul: What? Deny, deny, deny?

Charlene: Well, it’s worked for me.

Jean-Paul: Oh, the nerve of some people!

[end of dialogue]

Jean-Paul begins our dialogue by asking Charlene, “ What’s going on?” This is a question that could mean a couple of different thin gs, depending on how you ask it. “What’s going on?” means “What is happening?” If yo u say it to a friend of yours, it may just mean “How are you?” “How are things?” “ What’s new in your life?” But if you say it to someone with a certain intonation,  such as “What’s going on?” then you are asking about a problem. You are asking  for the reason why something is not going well, perhaps.

Jean-Paul uses this second meaning of the expressio n. He is clearly confused about what is happening. He says, “I thought it was  a done deal.” We don’t know what “it” was. Obviously some sort of agreement. A “done deal” (deal) is something that you have agreed to, something that h as been decided upon and about which you don’t expect there to be any change s. A “done deal” is something that has been “finalized,” we might say –  some agreement that everyone has already approved.

Charlene says, however, “I think you misunderstood. ” Charlene is telling Jean- Paul that it wasn’t a done deal – that they had not  finished their discussions about whatever this agreement was. Charlene continu es, “The last time we talked,” meaning the previous time we talked, “I sa id I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going to be g off.” “To partner (partner) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree to work  with another person – to make that person your partner, the person you work with.

Charlene says she was thinking about becoming Jean- Paul’s partner, presumably his business partner, but now that she h as thought about it more, she says she’s going “to beg (beg) off (off).” “To beg off” means to decide not to do what you were going to do. You’re asking, in a s ense, to be excused from some promise or commitment you made, or perhaps you  are simply changing your mind about what you want to do. Normally “to b eg” someone means to ask

something from that person. Here the idea is that y ou are asking the permission, perhaps, of that person to not do what you said you  were going to do.

Jean-Paul is not very happy. He says, “What you sai d was” – meaning the last time we spoke, you told me – “that you were agreeab le to the idea and that we would work out the details later.” “To be agreeable  (agreeable) to” something means that you like the idea, that you are okay wit h supporting it. You think it is a good thing. Jean-Paul says that Charlene was “agree able to the idea” of being his partner, and that he and Charlene “would work o ut the details later,” meaning they would figure out the specifics of their agreem ent later on.

“Now,” Jean-Paul says, Charlene is “backtracking.” “To backtrack” (backtrack) means to change your mind about what you had alread y agreed to, to try to undo or reverse what has already been done. If you say y ou are going to buy something for 10 dollars, and then 10 minutes later  you say, “No, I don’t think I will. I’ll only pay five dollars,” you are backtrac king. You are trying to go back on, or to change your mind about, something you have al ready promised to do. Charlene, however, disagrees. She says, “I would ne ver renege on a promise.”

“To renege (renege) on” something is to not do what  you have promised to do. It’s to break a deal or to break a commitment. Char lene says, “If I gave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.” “T o give your word” to someone means to make a promise to someone. The idea, howev er, when you say “I give you my word” is that it is something personal – tha t even though you are not signing a piece of paper, you are making this promi se to the person even without a contract, just “on your word,” just based on your  words that are spoken.

However, Charlene says that she didn’t give her wor d. If she had, however, she would have followed through. “To follow through” (t hrough) means to do what you say you were going to do, to keep your promise. Jea n-Paul says, “I’m really surprised by your denial.” A “denial” (denial) is w hen you say no to someone or when you say that something didn’t happen. If someo ne says, “I saw you last night with someone other than your girlfriend,” and  you say, “No, that wasn’t me,” that’s a denial. You’re saying no, it wasn’t true. Charlene is saying that she did not give her word to Jean-Paul. That’s a denial.

Jean-Paul says, “I didn’t have you pegged as someon e who backs out of deals.” “To have someone pegged” (pegged) as a certain thin g is to believe that someone has certain characteristics. If someone say s, “I didn’t have you pegged as a beer drinker,” that person means that he didn’ t think you were the kind of person who drank beer. Jean-Paul says he didn’t thi nk that Charlene was the

kind of person who “backs out of” deals. “To back o ut of” something is to break a promise, to renege on a promise or commitment.

Charlene says, “All I can say is that we don’t see eye to eye.” “All I can say” means “The only thing I can tell you at this point”  is that we don’t see eye to eye. “To see eye (eye) to eye” means simply to agree wit h another person, to think the same as another person, or to come to an agreem ent with another person. That’s why she says, “Let’s just agree to disagree and leave it at that.” The expression “to agree to disagree” means you are not  going to come to an agreement, but you’re not going to fight about it a nymore either. You’re going to stop arguing about it or trying to come to an agree ment.

So, if two people have different political opinions  and they discuss those opinions, at the end of their discussion they may s ay, “Well, let’s agree to disagree.” In other words, we don’t agree on anythi ng about politics, so we’ll just stop arguing now. That’s also what Charlene means b y the expression “to leave it at that.” “To leave it at that” means to stop yo ur conversation even though you have not yet come to an agreement.

Jean-Paul says, “That’s easy for you to say,” meani ng that’s easy for you but not easy for me. “Your failure to honor your promise is  going to put me in a very awkward position,” he says. “Failure (failure) to h onor (honor) a promise” means the same as to renege on your promise – not to do w hat you said you were going to do. Jean-Paul thinks that Charlene has failed to  honor her promise, and this is going to put him or place him in a “very awkward (a wkward) position.” An “awkward position” would be a situation that would be difficult for you, that would make things hard for you.

Charlene doesn’t understand. She says, “How’s that? ” meaning please explain what you mean. “We only spoke yesterday,” she says.  Jean-Paul responds, “I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.” “To get out of” something means to find a  way not to have to do what you said you were going to do – in other words, to renege on a commitment. So what happened here was that Jean-Paul went and made  some promises to other people based on what Charlene had promised to him.

Charlene says, “May I make a suggestion?” Jean-Paul  says, “What? Deny, deny, deny?” In other words, Charlene is suggesting that he do to others what Charlene did to him – simply lie and say that he ne ver made those promises. Charlene is saying “Yes, that’s what I just did. I basically lied. I denied that I had made a promise to you.”

Jean-Paul obviously is not very happy at this point , after Charlene now admits – she now says that basically she lied to him. He say s, “The nerve of some people!” The expression “the nerve (nerve) of some people” is used to express your frustration at someone else’s behavior – your shock and disapproval of the way someone else is acting, especially towards you.  Jean-Paul is saying that he can’t believe how much of a liar Charlene is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
