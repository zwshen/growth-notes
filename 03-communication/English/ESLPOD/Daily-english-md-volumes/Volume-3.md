# Text Messaging

complete transcript of everything that we say on the podcast.

Today's episode is called, “Text Messaging.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I was supposed to meet Jenny at the library, but I was late.  Jenny texted me: “I M @ lib wher r u?”

I’m not very good at texting so I used a template to say I was going to be late. When I arrived at the library, Jenny laughed at me because she knew I didn’t know how to text.

Richard:  I don’t know how to use this thing.  The phone kept making up words for me.

Jenny:  That's because you were composing in predictive text mode.  You have to change your settings to normal tap mode so only the characters you want show up in the screen.

Richard:  Okay, but everything still shows up in capital letters.

 Jenny:  You can change the option by pressing the button.  See?  The screen will show you what kind of letters or numbers you can get, and you keep pushing the button until the one you want comes up.

Richard:  What about the symb ol you used in your message?

Jenny:  You press the 1 button or the 0 button for those.  I use them as abbreviations to save time when I am texting.  I always use the symb ols “@” and “&” for “at” and “and.”  Simple words like “you,” “are,” and “be” can be spelled with the letters “u,” “r,” and “b.”  It saves time.

Richard:  Thanks.  I think I’ve got it, but it’ll take some practice for me to get up to speed.

Jenny:  No problem.  Each time I get a strange message that doesn’t make any sense, I’ll know it’s from you.

[End of story]

Today's episode is called, “Text Messaging.”  Text messaging is something that you can do on your cellular phone normally - your mobile phone - and it means to send a message like an email but through your telephone to someone else who has a cell phone or a mobile phone.  The word text, “text,” just means that it is something that is appearing on your screen or on a piece of paper as writing. So, you are writing someone a message, instead of calling them and talking to them you can send them a message on your cell phone.  This is very popular, especially among younger adults and teenagers.  I have to say that I don't think I have ever text messaged anyone.  Notice that we use that expression as a verb. To text someone, or to text message someone, is a verb which means to send them a text message.

Our dialogue begins with Richard saying that he “was supposed to meet Jenny at the library.”  They had made plans to meet at the library, but he was late.  Jenny texted him.  She sent him a text message, which said in regular English, “I am at the library.  Where are you?”  But the actual letters that Jenny used were not the same as you would use in a normal English sentence.  If you know something about text messaging, you know that people use letters and other signs and symb ols to keep the message short.  In this case, Jenny wrote in her text message, “I M,” the letter “M,” meaning I am.  The letter “M” is short for, or stands

 for, “am” in a text message.  This would be a good podcast to go to our website and look at the script for the podcast.  You can see the script for the dialogue by clicking on the name of the podcast on our web page, and there you can see how Jenny spelled. how she typed in her text message.

She said, “I M,” and then she used a symbol [@].  And a symb ol is something that, in this case, is not a letter like A, B, C - it's not a number like 1, 2, 3 - it's something different.  This symb ol means “at.”  But continuing with Jenny's message she says, “I am at,” and instead of saying the library, instead of typing that in her text message, she simply said lib, “lib.”  That meant the library - lib was short for library, and people do that when they send text messages, I guess. They shorten words so they don't have to type as much.

She then said “wher r u,” but she didn't spell it like we would normally.  She spelled where, “wher.”  Where is actually “where” in normal English, but in text message English you can shorten it.  The verb are is normally spelled “are,” but in a text message it's just the letter “r,”  And you is not “you” in text message English, it's the letter “u.”

So, Jenny sends this text message, and I say that “I’m not very good at texting,” that is sending text messages, “so I used a template to say I was going to be late.”  A template, “template,” is a model that you can use or change.  When we talk about text messaging, it's a list of commo n messages or common expressions that you can select on your cell phone so you don't have to type them out.

Well, “I used a template to say I was going to be late.”  When I got to the library, “When I arrived at the library, Jenny laughed at me because she knew I didn’t know how to text.”  I said to her that, “I don’t know how to use this thing.  The phone kept making up words for me.”  To make, “make,” up, “up,” two words, is a verb that means to invent, things that you didn't, in this case, plan.  The phone was making up words.  It was inventing words.  It was coming up with words.  It was putting words on the screen almost by itself.  And, Jenny said the reason that my phone was doing that was because I was “composing in predictive text mode.”  To compose, “compose,” as a verb means to write, to think about and to write.  We use this verb, to compose, often when we are talking about a letter or a message.  We also use this verb when we are talking about music.  We say that, for example, J.S. Bach was a person who composed beautiful music.  The

 person that composes music is called a composer.  But here, compose means to write, and Jenny says that I was “composing in predictive text mode.”

The word predictive, “predictive,” comes from the verb to predict, “predict.”  To predict means to guess something, to guess something about the future, to say what will happen.  So, the adjective, predictive, means that the phone guesses, in this case, what word you are going to try to type, because the phone is like a little computer and it has memory of what commo n words that people use.  So, when you have a text messaging telephone, cell phone, it will often have this predictive text mode.  A mode, “mode,” is a way of doing something.  So, when we say it's in predictive text mode that means that the phone will try to guess what you are going to say, so you may only type or press the first two or three letters of a word and it will guess what you want.

Jenny says that Richard has “to change” his “settings to normal tap mode.”  Your settings, “settings,” are the rules, if you will, that your computer uses, or your cell phone uses.  We talk about settings to mean things that you can change about a machine.  For example, on your computer you can make the screen bright or you can make it dark, light or dark, bright or not bright.  You can change the colors on your computer screen.  These are settings, variables that you can change, things that you can change about the machine so that will perform or act differently.

Normal tap, “tap,” mode is the opposite of predictive text mode.  It's when the computer doesn't guess what you want.  You have to put in every letter that you want to send in your text message.  The word tap, “tap,” as a verb, means to press.  To tap also can mean to touch something lightly.  “He was tapping his fingers on the top of the desk.”  He was touching his fingers, hitting the desk with his fingers lightly.  Jenny says that if Richard uses normal tap mode only the characters he wants will appear, or show up, on the screen.  The characters, “characters,” are the letters and the numbers.  The screen is the little thing that you can view the message on on your telephone.

Well, Richard says, “everything still shows up in capital letters.” Everything on the screen appears in capital letters.  Capital, “capital,” letters are letters that are large or big.  We sometimes call these upper case letters, upper case, “case,” letters.  For example, in English your name begins with a capital letter, or an upper case letter.  The opposite - the small letters would be lower case letters.

 Jenny says that, “You can change the option by pressing the button.”  The option, “option,” is the...the way that something is done, the mode or the manner that something is done.  “The screen,” she says, “will show you what kind of letters and numbers you can get, and you just keep pushing the button until the one you want comes up,” or appears.

Richard asks about the symb ol that Jenny used in her message.  Remember a symb ol, “symb ol,” is something that is not a number or a letter.  And, Jenny explains that on her phone, you press the number one or the number zero button for those special symb ols.  She uses “them as abbreviations to save time.”  An abbreviation is a short form of a word or expression.  Jenny says she always uses the symb ol at [@], which is an “a” with a circle around it, and ampersand [&], “ampersand.”  Ampersand is that funny symb ol that sort of looks like the number eight.  Jenny also explains that simple words like you, are and be are often spelled with just the letter “u,” “r” and “b.”

Richard thanks Jenny and says that he thinks he's “got it,” or he thinks he's understood it, “but it’ll take some practice for” him “to get up to speed.”  The expression, to get up to speed, means to be able to do something as well as someone else, or as well as an expert, to get better at something, to get up to speed.  If you are learning, for example, how to play a musical instrument, and you want to play with someone else who is very good, you may have to practice in order to get up to speed, to be as good as them.

Jenny says, “No problem.  Each time I get a strange” text “message that doesn’t make any sense,” she'll “know it’s from” Richard.  To not make any sense, “sense,” means that it is not logical or that it doesn't have any meaning because, it’s done, in this case, incorrectly.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

I was supposed to meet Jenny at the library, but I was late.  Jenny texted me: “I M @ lib wher r u?”

I’m not very good at texting so I used a template to say I was going to be late. When I arrived at the library, Jenny laughed at me because she knew I didn’t know how to text.

 Richard:  I don’t know how to use this thing.  The phone kept making up words for me.

# Using Visuals in a Presentation

complete transcript of this episode.

Today’s podcast is called “Using Visuals in a Presentation.”  Let’s get started.

[Start of story]

Rosa:  Thanks a lot for offering to give me some pointers on how to use visuals for my presentation.  I’ve never given a presentation like this before.

Milo:  I’m glad I can help.  What do you plan to use?

Rosa:  Well, I plan to show these slides for the first part of the talk.  First, I have this pie chart that shows the types of services our company provides.  Then, I have this bar graph to show how the company has grown in the past 20 years. But, I’m not really sure how to talk about them.

Milo:  Okay, first, when you’re using a chart, make sure you explain what each part represents.  For example, on this pie chart, I would explain that each slice of the pie represents a percentage of the business.  Then, for this bar chart, I’d make sure to tell the audience what the X-axis and Y-axis stand for, and what each increment represents.  That way, the trend that the company is following is clear.  Are you planning on using this line chart, too?

Rosa:  No, I changed my mind about that.  I think it’s a little confusing, but your tips on the other charts are really helpful.  I have this flip chart, too, that I’m

 supposed to use but I’m not sure how.  I don’t want turn my back on the audience during the presentation.

Milo:  The second half of the presentation includes some audience participation, right?   Then, I think it’s fine to use it during that part of the talk.  Any other questions?

Rosa:  I don’t think so.  You’ve been so helpful.  I hope you’ll let me take you to lunch as a token of thanks.

Milo:  You don’t need to treat, but I’d be happy to have lunch together.  Let’s go.

[End of story]

This podcast is called, “Using Visuals in a Presentation.”  A visual, “visual,” is something you can see.  A visual in a presentation would be things like pictures or graphs or charts or a PowerPoint presentation – all of these would be visuals.

Well, our dialogue begins with Rosa telling Milo that she is thankful that he is offering to give her some pointers on how to use visuals in her presentation.  A pointer, “pointer,” means a tip or some advice on how to do something.  Usually, we use this term, pointers, when someone understands how to do something in a general way, but needs perhaps some additional help or some tips on improving what they are doing.

Rosa said that she’s never given a presentation similar to this one before.  Milo says he’s glad he can help; he asks Rosa what she plans on using in her presentation.  Rosa says, “Well, I plan,” or I intend, “to show these slides for the first part of the talk.  A slide, “slide,” is one frame, usually nowadays in a PowerPoint presentation.  So, if you have used Microsoft PowerPoint or other similar software, you know that each page is something that you can show people on a computer or you can put it up on a screen – a blank area that everyone can see it – that individual page is called a slide when it’s part of a PowerPoint presentation.

In the old days, back before we had computers, one of the more popular ways to show things was to have a slide projector.  If you needed to show pictures to a big group, you would have these little photographs that we called slides, and then you put them in a wheel and the wheel moved around and the projector, which

 showed the picture up on the screen, that would be used to look at each one of these slides.  Now we use the term mostly to refer to pages in a PowerPoint or similar presentation.

Rosa says that she has a couple of different kinds of graphics that she’s going to use.  A graphic, “graphic,” is similar to a visual, but it usually refers to a chart or a graph or a table.  Rosa says that she has a pie, “pie” chart that shows different types of services that her company provides.  A pie chart is what it sounds like; it’s a round circle – looks like a pie that you would eat.  The pie is cut into sections; the sections, or the pieces of the pie represent a certain percentage, usually.  A bar graph, “bar graph,” two words, is when you have a set of lines, usually they’re vertical, but they could be horizontal – they could go up and down or side to side – and the tall lines represent more of something and the short lines represent less of something.  Usually they’re lines that are maybe a quarter or a half inch thick – a couple of centimeters thick – and they show sometimes different colors on the bar graph to represent different products or different concepts that you are trying to show.  So, a bar graph helps show how much you have of something.

Milo explains to Rosa how you would use these different kinds of charts and graphs.  Milo says it’s important if “you’re using a chart to explain what each part of the chart represents.”  When we say it represents something, we mean that it stands for, or it is supposed to show you how much of something there is.  So, you may have a chart that has the color red for product A and the color blue for product B, and if it’s a pie chart, you may show what percentage of people buy product A versus product B.  So, each part represents, or stands for something in a graph or chart.

Milo explains that on a pie chart “each slice of the pie represents a percentage of the business.”  A slice, “slice,” of the pie is a...same as a piece of a pie.  It’s a section, or a part of the pie.  We use that word, slice, when we are talking about things that are round that you eat.  So for example, you can have a slice of pizza – pizza is usually round – and a slice would be something that looks like a triangle with a round base – a round end, and we use that word for pies as well. Well, this is a pie chart, so we’re going to talk about a slice of the pie chart.  We don’t eat the pie chart, unless you’re really hungry!  You can also use that word, slice, when you’re talking about a piece of cake, for example, even if the cake is not round.  Any kind of food that you can cut up into smaller pieces could be referred to as a slice.

 A bar chart is something that tells you how much you have of a certain thing, and it has two different lines that indicate how much you have of something.  One line is called the X-axis, and the X-axis is the horizontal line – it’s the line that goes from side to side.  The Y-axis – and axis is “axis,” usually it’s hyphenated, x-axis, y-axis – the Y-axis is the one that is vertical – that goes up and down.  And, on a bar chart, the Y-axis will usually have some numbers that tell you how much of something there is – what that bar represents – the quantity.  For example, it could be percentage, and you would have on the Y-axis 25, 50, 75, 100, and then you would look at how tall the bar was and you would see what percentage it was based on the marks, or the signs or indications on the Y-axis.

The difference between each of the marks is called an increment, “increment.” An increment is the distance or amount or difference between each mark on the Y-axis.  So, in our example, the increment was 25 percent because you have 25, 50, 75, 100.  Each mark is 25 percent higher or more than the one below it.  Milo says that it’s important to have these indications on the X and Y-axis so people can understand the trend that the company is following.  Trend, “trend,” is the same as direction.  So, is the trend going up, or is the trend going down?  Is the company getting better, or is the company getting worse?

Milo also asks Rosa if she plans on using a line chart.  A line, “line,” chart is a chart that has lines that indicate, usually, how something is changing over time. And, you may have, for example, how much money the company made in the last five years.  And, on the X-axis – the one that is horizontal – you would have the years, and on the Y-axis – the one that goes up and down, the vertical line – you would show how much money the company made each year.  In a line chart you could follow and see if it goes up or down.  Hopefully, it will go up!

Rosa says that she’s not going to use a line chart; she said she changed her mind.  To change you mind means to change your opinion, to decide to do something different.  Rosa said that she changed her mind.  She thinks the line chart is too confusing, but she thanks Milo for his other pointers, his other tips. Rosa also says that she has a flip chart.  A flip, “flip,” chart is not the same as a pie chart or a line chart.  A flip chart is a big piece of paper, sort of like a big notebook.  Usually it’s blank paper and it is, maybe, three feet high and two feet wide, and it’s what you can use to write on.  So, if you are talking to a big group, you can write on the flip chart, on the paper.  Usually it’s sitting on a stand, “stand,” – a tripod stand – you can write on it, so that people can see it, with a

 marker or pen.  You can write notes and information for the people who are listening to you so they can see it.

She says, however, that she doesn’t want to turn her back on the audience in her presentation.  To turn your back on someone means that you turn around so that you’re not looking at them, that they can only see your back.  That’s to turn your back on the audience.  Milo says that the second part of the presentation is supposed to have some “audience participation.”  Audience participation means that the people who are listening to the presentation can ask questions or make comme nts.  He suggests to Rosa that she can use the flip chart during the second half of her talk.  Her talk, of course, is just another word for her presentation.

Rosa thanks Milo and offers to take him “to lunch as a token,” “token,” “of thanks.”  A token is a sign of thanks.  It’s a way of expressing thanks.  Someone may say, “Take this as a token of my appreciation.”  It’s usually a gift, or something you give someone to thank them for doing something for you.  Milo says that Rosa doesn’t “need to treat,” but he would be happy to go to lunch with her.  When we say that someone is going to treat, “treat,” you to lunch, we mean they’re going to pay, and Milo is saying you don’t have to pay for my lunch, but I will be happy to have lunch with you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

Rosa:  Thanks a lot for offering to give me some pointers on how to use visuals for my presentation.  I’ve never given a presentation like this before.

# A Generation Gap

complete transcript.

On today's podcast we're going to talk about how parents and their children sometimes don't understand each other.  It's called, “A Generation Gap.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Carlos:  Belinda, maybe you can explain it to me.  My parents still don’t get me.  I got a couple of tattoos and they freaked out.

Belinda:  Why are you asking me?  I may be a few years older than you are, but I don’t understand parents any better than you do.  They’re hopelessly behind the times.

Carlos:  I don’t really expect them to keep up with what’s going on right now or to know anything about what’s in and what’s out, but I thought they’d understand if I wanted to express myse lf.  They were hippies in their day.

Belinda:  Yeah, but being a hippie isn’t the same thing as being a hipster.  Most of them just don’t keep up with pop culture.  You know, now that I think about it, I’m not sure that’s such a bad thing.

Carlos:  What do you mean?

Belinda:  Can you imagine going to the same clubs as your parents, or you and your parents reading the same blogs?

 Carlos:  Oh, that would really suck.  Okay, you’ve made your point.  Things could be a lot worse.

[End of story]

The title of today's episode is, “A Generation Gap.”  A generation is a group of people who are born during the same years or during the same set of years. Usually it's people born within 10 or 15 years of when you are born.  The term doesn't have a scientific definition when we use it in general conversation, but people who are born in the same 10, 15, maybe even 20 period that you are born would be part of your generation.

A gap, “gap,” is a space between two things, an empty space, usually.  But, the term generation gap refers to the differences between people who are born 15 or 20 years apart.  Usually the parent and the child are considered to be in separate generations, and so they often don't understand each other and we call that problem of not understanding people who are older than you or younger than you a generation gap.

Well, our dialogue is between Carlos and Belinda.  Carlos begins by asking Belinda to explain something to him.  He says, “My parents still don’t get me.” The use of the verb “get” here is similar to the verb under - to understand.  What he's saying is that my parents still don’t understand me, they still don't get me - it's a little more informal.

He says “I got a couple of tattoos and they freaked out.”  A tattoo, “tattoo,” is when you put ink on your skin.  You color your skin, usually put a word or some artistic design, some picture on your skin.  Most tattoos are permanent, which means even after you wash your skin you can still see the ink.  And, this is very popular among...well, it used to be popular among rock stars, for example, but now many younger people have tattoos.  I have a tattoo on the back of my head. It's the sign, or logo, for ESL Podcast, so if you ever see me, look at the back of my head!

The parents of Carlos “freaked out.”  When Carlos says his parents freaked, “freaked,” out, he meant that they became very angry or they became very excited.  To freak out means to have very strong emotions about something, usually negative emotions, usually anger, or when someone gets mad.

 Belinda says, “Why are you asking me” this question.  “I may be a few years older than you, but,” she says, “I don’t understand parents any better than you do.”  That expression, any better than, is used when we want to say that you are equal to someone else, when you are comparing someone else.  You might actually be a little worse, but you are not any better than, you are not higher than them or superior to them in your understanding or your ability to do something. So, Belinda says that she doesn't understand parents better than Carlos, or any better than Carlos.  She says, “They’re hopelessly behind the times.”  To be behind the times means to not understand or not know the most recent or the most current news and events.  Someone who doesn't know what has happened recently is considered behind the times.

Carlos says that he doesn't really expect his parents “to keep up with what's going on right now.”  The expression, to keep, “keep,” up with, means that you understand and know about all the things that are happening.  So, it's sort of the opposite of being behind the times.  To keep up with means that you know about the current or most recent news about something.  There are other meanings to that expression, to keep up with, and we talk about those additional meanings in our Learning Guide, so take a look at that.  We also talk about other meanings of the verb to get.

Well, Carlos says that he doesn't expect his parents “to keep up with what's going on right now or to know anything about what's in and what's out.”  The expression “what's in and what's out” refer to knowing what's popular and what's not popular.  So, something that is “in” is something that is popular; many people are doing it.  Something that is “out” is something that is unpopular; it's not something that many people are doing.

Carlos says he thought his parents would understand if he wanted to express himself.  To express yourself means to show your creativity, to do something that tells other people what you are like, what you think.  It's often an expression that we use when someone does something artistic, but it could also mean that you are showing other people what you think about something by something that you do, such as getting a tattoo, especially a tattoo on the back of your head, like me!

Carlos says that his parents “were hippies in their day.”  Hippies, “hippies,” is a word that we use to talk about people who were teenagers or college students usually in the 1960’s, especially in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, and hippies

 were young people, like my older brother, Pat.  He was definitely a hippie.  These were people that protested against the war in Vietnam, when the United States was in Vietnam.  These are also people that may have used illegal drugs or dressed in a very different kind of clothing.  There are many things that we associate with the hippie culture, but that is...those are some of the most important things.  So, they were considered somewhat radical from a cultural point of view.  They were people that rejected the traditional culture.

Belinda says that “being a hippie” is not the same “as being a hipster.”  A hipster, hipster,” is someone who keeps up with or knows about all of the latest trends or latest ideas in fashion and music.  It's a term we usually use now to describe people in their 20’s or in their late teens who knows all of the most popular bands and dresses with all the most popular type of clothing.  We generally talk about the culture that is associated, especially with young people, we generally call that “pop culture” - “pop,” pop culture.  Pop is short for popular.  So, it's the culture of young people, but it's also the culture of the general population really.  Popular television shows, popular music - these are all parts of pop culture.

Belinda says that not having the parents know about things is not such a bad idea, not “such a bad thing.”  Carlos says “What do you mean,” and Belinda says, “Can you imagine going to the same clubs as your parents?”  A club, “club,” is short for a dance club, a place where you go to dance, and if you are over 21 years old, a place where you can also go to drink alcohol.  Belinda says imagine if you or your parents were “reading the same blogs.”  A blog, “blog,” is short for a web log, and you probably know this is a web page where people can put their own ideas on any topic they want onto a web page.

Carlos says, “Oh,” if that were true - if his parents went to the same clubs or read the same blogs, “that would really suck,” “suck.”  The verb, to suck, is an informal verb, popular especially among younger speakers, but it's now become popular, really informally, among many people of different ages.  To suck means that it is very bad, that it is a very negative or bad thing, it would be bad thing.  For example, it would suck to have to go to work every day for 20 hours a day.  That would be a bad thing.  Or, it would suck not to be able to listen to ESL Podcast every day.  Again, it's an informal word, and you would only want to use that with friends, close friends.  You would not want to say that to your boss, for example.

Carlos says that Belinda has made her point.  To make your point means that you prove, or demonstrate, or show that something is true.  He says, “Things

 could be a lot worse.”  This means that the situation is not as bad as it could be. It could be worse.

If you are interested in this idea of a generation gap and different generations, be sure to look at the cultural note for this podcast.  We explain terms like “generation X,” “ generation Y,” “baby boomer.”  These are very popular terms in English, and we give more information there.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Carlos:  Belinda, maybe you can explain it to me.  My parents still don’t get me.  I got a couple of tattoos and they freaked out.

Belinda:  Why are you asking me?  I may be a few years older than you are, but I don’t understand parents any better than you do.  They’re hopelessly behind the times.

Carlos:  I don’t really expect them to keep up with what’s going on right now or to know anything about what’s in and what’s out, but I thought they’d understand if I wanted to express myse lf.  They were hippies in their day.

Belinda:  Yeah, but being a hippie isn’t the same thing as being a hipster.  Most of them just don’t keep up with pop culture.  You know, now that I think about it, I’m not sure that’s such a bad thing.

Carlos:  What do you mean?

Belinda:  Can you imagine going to the same clubs as your parents, or you and your parents reading the same blogs?

Carlos:  Oh, that would really suck.  Okay, you’ve made your point.  Things could be a lot worse.

# Giving Birth in a Hospital

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 207, “Giving Birth in a Hospital.”  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 207.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Be sure to visit our website at eslpod.com.  There you can find a complete Learning Guide for this podcast.  This is an eight to ten page guide that gives you all of the words and definitions that we will discuss today.  It will also give you some additional new definitions and words that we don't talk about on the podcast, as well as a cultural note related to today's topic.  Today's topic is having a baby in a hospital.  Let's get started.  [Start of story]  It was 2 o’clock in the morning when my wife woke me up.  She is eight-and-a-half months pregnant and she told me that her water had broken.  She said that she was having contractions and she was sure that she was in labor.  I paged our doctor and drove to the hospital.    When we arrived, we went straight to the maternity ward.  I went to the reception desk, and told the clerk that my wife was in labor and needed to be admitted right away.  The nurse asked me for my insurance card and gave me three forms to fill out.  She said that someone would take my wife into the birthing suite soon.    The doctor arrived and she examined my wife.  She told us that this wasn’t false labor and that my wife was pretty far along.  After a lot of pushing, the baby came out head first, not breech, and it was healthy.    I was so relieved, I couldn’t stop hugging my wife.  Then, I hugged the doctor, and the nurse, and the janitor!     [End of story] # Corporate Image

complete transcript of this episode.

Today's episode is about the image of a company, the “Corporate Image.”  Let's start.

[Start of story]

Adam:  With our expansion into these new areas of business, I think we need to think seriously about changing our corporate image.  We’re much more than just a paper company now.

Eva:  I think you’re right.  Our brand has changed, and if we want to keep brand loyalty, we need to think about protecting and improving our product image.

Adam:  I agree that that’s a key issue as we reposition ourselves in the industry. We can never lose sight of our end-users.

Eva:  And, even though we have registered trademarks on some of the new prestige products, we need to have a plan if we want to turn these new products into household names.

Adam:  I suggest we think about hiring a public relations firm.  They may be able to help us update our corporate image and logo, and to shape our new corporate identity.

Eva:  Why don’t I contact a few PR firms and set up some meetings?

 Adam:  Yes, do that.  That seems like the logical next step.

[End of story]

Our podcast today is called, “Corporate Image.”  Corporate, “corporate,” refers to a corporation.  A corporation is a large company that has registered with the government for a specific kind of organization, business organization usually. So, corporate, as an adjective, describes something related to a large company or a corporation.  Image, in this case, means how people view you, how people think about you.  So, the corporate image would be what people see as your company, what it is like, what does it do and so forth.

We have a dialogue between Adam and Eva.  Adam says, “With our expansion into these new areas of business, I think we need to think seriously about changing our corporate image.”  An expansion, “expansion,” is a noun that comes from the verb to expand, “expand.”  To expand means to get bigger, to grow larger.  So, an expansion, as a noun, is when a company or a business decides to grow, decides to become bigger.  Adam is saying that because their business is growing - because of their expansion into new areas for their business, new things for their business - he thinks that the company should think about changing its corporate image.  “We’re much more than just a paper company now,” Adam says, meaning that we do more just, I guess, make paper.

Eva says, “I think you're right.  Our brand has changed, and if we want to keep brand loyalty, we need to think about” improving, protecting rather, “and improving our product image.”  Brand, “brand,” refers to the name of a product or a series of products made by a company.  For example, I have an Apple computer.  That is the brand.  That's the company that makes it.  Usually the brand is the same name of the company, but it is not always the case. Sometimes companies will choose different names for their products or types of products.  A brand usually has more than one kind of product, however, so Apple, as a brand for computers, has many different kinds of computers.

Eva says that “if we want to keep” our “brand loyalty,” loyalty, “loyalty,” means the same as support.  So, someone who is loyal to you is someone who supports you or someone who is faithful to you.  To be faithful, “faithful,” means that you don't do anything against that person, you stay with that person.  Brand loyalty then, is the idea that people who buy your products - your customers - will continue to buy your products in the future, the things that you make.

 Eva says that “we need to think about protecting and improving,” or making better, “our product image.”  A product is something that a company makes and sells to other people.  Product image then, would be what people think of the particular thing they sell.

Adam says, “I agree that that is a key issue as we reposition ourselves in the industry.”  Key, “key,” issue means important issue.  When we say something is key, we mean it is very important.  We might also say it is vital, “vital,” it's very important.  To reposition, “reposition,” means to change your position, to change your place, to change where you are.  It is a verb that you sometimes hear in business.  When businesses talk about repositioning themselves, they're talking about changing what they do, changing how people perceive them, or see them, changing what they do in terms of what they make and what they do.  The prefix re, “re,” in front of a verb in English usually means to do it again, and so to reposition would mean to position, or place yourself again.

Adam says that the company “can never lose sight of” its “end-users.”  To lose sight, “sight,” means to forget about, to not pay attention to.  Someone may say, “Don't lose sight of your goal,” or “of your objective,” what you are trying to do, don't forget about that.  An end-user, “end-user,” is the person that actually uses your product, uses what you are selling.  It may be the same person as the customer - the person who buys it - but not always.  For example, in a company, the company may be the customer.  They may buy some new computers, but the end-users are the individual employees, the individual workers in the company. They are the end-users.

Eva says, “Even though we have registered trademarks on some of the new prestige products, we need to have a plan if we want to turn” those “products into household names.”  A trademark, “trademark,” is a word or a name or even a sign or a symb ol that represents a company or represents a particular product, and a trademark - a registered trademark - is something that you do with the government.  In the United States, the federal government has an office where you can register your trademark so no one else steals it, so no one else tries to use it and say it's theirs.  So, that is a registered trademark.  Usually if someone has a registered trademark, you'll see the letter “R” in a small circle next to name. For example, on the TOEFL Podcast there's a little “R” next to the word TOEFL. That means it is a registered trademark of a particular company.

 Eva says that they “have registered trademarks on some of the new prestige products.”  Prestige, “prestige,” is an adjective to describe something that people admire, something that people like, something that, if you have it, it's considered to be an important sign or symb ol of how important you are or how rich you are. So, a prestige product might be, in the United States, a Mercedes Benz, or a BMW , or a similar expensive car - that might be considered a prestige product.

Eva says that, “we need to have a plan if we want to turn these new products into household names.”  To turn something into the something else means to change them into something else, to change them so that they are different.  Eva's suggesting that the company needs to make changes if it wants “to turn these products into household names.”  A household, “household,” all one word, usually refers to the people who live in a house or an apartment.  Everyone who lives there is part of the household.  But, the expression, a household name, means that everyone in the country knows about it.  It is very popular.  A household name could be a product; it could also be a person.  For example, Brad Pitt, who looks just like me, is a household name.  Everyone who lives in the United States, or almost everyone, knows who he is.

Adam says that the company should “think about hiring a public relations firm,” or a public relations company.  These are people who work on advertising, for example, or helping people change their image, what people think of them.  That public relations firm, which we would often just say PR firm, if someone says PR firm they mean it's a public relations firm, this PR firm may be able to help the company update their corporate image.  To update, “update,” means to change something so that it is more current, more modern.  They want to update their corporate image and their logo.  A logo, “logo,” is a sign or a symb ol of a company.  For ESL Podcast, if you go to our website, in the top left corner you'll see our logo that says, “ESL  Pod,” with a little picture.

Adam says he hopes the PR firm can “shape” their “new corporate identity.”  To shape, “shape,” means to change, to influence, to control.  If someone shapes the plans that means they influence the plans, they have some control over them. Corporate identity is a larger name that's similar to corporate image.  It's how a company sees itself, how they identify themselves, what people think of when they think of the company.

Well, Eva says that she will “contact a few PR firms,” and Adam says, “Yes. That seems like the logical next step.”  A step, “step,” is the next part of a plan or next

 part of a process that you are doing.  So, when we say something is the logical next step, we mean it's the most reasonable, it's the most intelligent next thing that you should do.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native of rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Adam:  With our expansion into these new areas of business, I think we need to think seriously about changing our corporate image.  We’re much more than just a paper company now.

Eva:  I think you’re right.  Our brand has changed, and if we want to keep brand loyalty, we need to think about protecting and improving our product image.

Adam:  I agree that that’s a key issue as we reposition ourselves in the industry. We can never lose sight of our end-users.

# Extreme Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 209, “Extreme Sports.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 209.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  We have several new things you'll want to take a look at, and of course, to download the Learning Guide for this podcast.  The Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary that we talk about, as well as additional words and explanations and a complete transcript of this pod cast.

Today's podcast is called, “Extreme Sports.”  Let's go.

[Start of story]

Celeste:  I’m so glad it’s Friday.  Are you doing anything this weekend?

Ryan:  I’m going snowboarding with James.

Celeste:  Didn’t you guys go bungee jumping last weekend?

Ryan:  Yeah, and we plan to go cave diving in a couple of weeks.

Celeste:  I didn’t know you were into extreme sports.  I guess it’s a big adrenaline rush.

Ryan:  It is.  But for me, it’s about pushing myself to the limit.

Celeste:  Aren’t you afraid of getting hurt?

Ryan:  Sure.  There’s always a danger of getting hurt, but we don’t do these sports competitively.  It’s just for fun.  I like trying new stunts and seeing how far we can push the boundaries of the sport.  Do you want to come with us sometime?

 Celeste:  Me?   I’m not really the adventurous type.

Ryan:  You never know.  You might like it.  After cave diving, we’ll probably try climbing.

Celeste:  Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad.  I’ve done some climbing before.

Ryan:  I should tell you that we plan on going ice climbing.

Celeste:  Oh.  In that case, I think I’ll pass.  Have fun this weekend.

Ryan:  Thanks and let me know if you change your mind.

[End of story]

The title of our podcast is “Extreme Sports.”  Extreme, “extreme,” as an adjective is used when we are describing something that is far beyond normal, something that is very high or very serious.  Extreme temperatures would be very high temperatures.  Extreme danger would be something that is very dangerous, something that you could get hurt by.  Extreme sports refers to sports that are dangerous.

Our dialogue is between Celeste and Ryan, and Celeste says that she is glad that “it's Friday,” and asks Ryan if he is “doing anything this weekend,” meaning what are you doing this Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Ryan says, “I'm going snowboarding with James.”  To snowboard, “snowboard,” all one word, means to ride on the snow, the cold snow on a mountain or on a hill, sort of like skiing.  So, to snowboard is similar to ski, except you don't use two long pieces of wood or plastic as skis, but you have a board that is just one piece and you put both feet on the board.  Snowboarding, as a sport, is fairly new.  It comes, I think, originally from skateboarding.  A skateboard, “skateboard,” again all one word, is using the same kind of board as you do on a snowboard, except it has wheels on it.  This is very popular, especially among teenagers.

Ryan is going snowboarding with his friend, and Celeste says, “Didn’t you guys go bungee jumping last weekend?”  Bungee, “bungee,” jumping is another extreme sport, meaning it could be dangerous.  Essentially, a bungee is a long rope or cord that is like a rubber band.  It stretches, and you go to a very high place, such as on a bridge, and you tie the cord to the bridge and then you jump

 off the bridge, and this cord or rope will bounce like a rubber band, and you'll be able to get back up or have someone pick you up at the bottom.  That is bungee jumping.

Ryan says, “Yeah, and we plan to go cave diving in a couple of weeks.”  Again, cave, “cave,” diving is another extreme sport.  A cave is a large hole, usually in a hill or in a area close to water many times you'll find caves.  Sometimes in mountains you find caves.  They're like big holes, almost like a room inside a hill. Well, cave diving is actually for caves that are underwater, and what happens is you go into the water and then you go into these caves that are either all underwater or partially underwater.  That is cave diving.

Celeste says that she “didn't know' Ryan was “into extreme sports.”  To be into something means that you are interested in it, that you like it, that you participate in it.  So, you could say, “I'm into playing chess.”  I like to play chess, as an example.  I don't, but that would be an example.

Celeste says,” I guess it’s a big adrenaline rush,” doing these extreme sports. Adrenaline, “adrenaline,” is the chemical that your body releases when you are excited or when you are very stressed, you have a lot of problems, or perhaps you are in danger and you need to run quickly.  The body produces this chemical, what we would call this hormone, “hormone,” that makes your heart beat faster.  The expression, adrenaline rush, means that you get this sudden burst of, or sudden increase in adrenaline.  The word rush is sometimes informally used to mean a very exciting or very intense experience, and so adrenaline rush would be the feeling you get when you have a lot of the adrenaline in your body.  Ryan says that it is an adrenaline rush, but for him “it's about pushing” himself “to the limit.”  To push yourself to the limit means that you try to do as much as you can, as much as you physically can, to do the maximum amount that is possible for you and for your body.

Celeste says, “Aren’t you afraid of getting hurt,” meaning aren't you afraid that you will get an injury, “injury.”  An injury is when you when you break your leg or you cut your arm.  These would be things that hurt you.  These are injuries.  So, she says, “Aren’t you afraid of getting hurt?” - of having pain?  Ryan says, “Sure. There’s always a danger of getting hurt,” meaning it's always possible that you will get hurt.  The expression, “a danger of,” is when we are talking about something that is a risk, something that may cause us to be hurt.

 Ryan says that they “don’t do these sports competitively.”  Competitively is an adverb that comes from the verb to compete, “compete.”  To compete is when you have a contest against someone else, when two or more people are trying to win a prize or be the best at something.  So, Ryan says he doesn't do extreme sports competitively, he means that he's not part of a team or he's not trying to win something.  “It’s just for fun,” he says, “I like trying new stunts.”  A stunt, “stunt,” is something that requires usually a lot of skill, you have to be good at it, and it is often something that is somewhat dangerous.  In a movie, for example, there may be many different stunts.  In the movie Mission Impossible, with Tom Cruise, there are many different dangerous things that happens: cars go very fast and people jump off of buildings.  These are all stunts.  People aren't actually getting hurt, but they have someone who can make it look like they're doing some of these things.  These people, by the way, are called stuntmen and stuntwomen.

Ryan says that he likes to “push the boundaries of” a sport.  To push the boundaries is similar to pushing yourself to the limit.  A boundary is the same as a limit or a border.  So, to push the boundaries means to do as much as is possible, to do something with a maximum effort, with a great effort.

Ryan asks Celeste if she wants to come with them, and Celeste says, “I’m not really the adventurous type.”  Adventurous is an adjective that comes from the noun adventure, and an adventure is when you do things that are new, do things that are different, perhaps do things that are dangerous, but not necessarily. Someone who is adventurous likes to try new things, to go to new places.

Ryan says that they are going to be “going ice climbing.”  To climb, “climb,” means to go up something.  So, you can climb a wall, if you have a rope.  You can go up a wall.  You can climb a mountain.  Mountain climbing - you have a rope or you just use your hands and you go up the rock, the mountain.  This is ice climbing, so they're obviously going somewhere cold where they can climb on ice.  Celeste says well, “In that case,” because it's ice climbing she says, “I think I'll pass.”  When me say we are going to pass, “pass,” on something, we mean we're going to say no, we're not going to do it this time.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

 [Start of story]

Celeste:  I’m so glad it’s Friday.  Are you doing anything this weekend?

Ryan:  I’m going snowboarding with James.

Celeste:  Didn’t you guys go bungee jumping last weekend?

Ryan:  Yeah, and we plan to go cave diving in a couple of weeks.

Celeste:  I didn’t know you were into extreme sports.  I guess it’s a big adrenaline rush.

Ryan:  It is.  But for me, it’s about pushing myself to the limit.

# A Family Road Trip

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 210, “A Family Road Trip.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 210.  I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com and download the Learning Guide for this podcast.  It contains all of the vocabulary, as well as additional words, explanations and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is about a family taking a vacation trip in their car.  Let's go!

[Start of story]

Our family decided to take a road trip across the country this year.  The kids were really excited and my oldest son wanted to help navigate.  Before the trip, we looked at the road maps and decided on our route and the points of interest we would try to see.  Since we wouldn’t be taking a camper, we needed to make hotel reservations along the way.  After a little planning, we were ready to go.

The kids were behaving themselves the first day.  My daughter was a little car sick in the morning, but we made it to our first stop without any major problems. On the second day, though, the kids were really acting up.  They kept asking, “Are we there yet?” and they wanted to stop at every rest stop.  My youngest son, who is only four, kept calling out the mile markers as we passed them, and I thought my head would explode if he didn’t stop.  On top of that, my wife wanted to stop every few miles for a photo op and I thought we’d never get to the next town.

By the third day, I was really questioning the wisdom of taking three young children on the road for 10 days.  I suspect that after this vacation, I’ll need another one to recover from it.

[End of story]

 Today, we take a road trip.  A road trip is when you take your car, travel in your car, on a short vacation or it could be a long vacation.  Many families like to visit historical places.  In our Learning Guide for this episode, we talk about some of the most popular places where Americans visit on their vacation.

The family in our story - not my family, I should say - goes on a road trip.  The story begins by the narrator saying that, “Our family decided to take a road trip across the country this year.”  Usually when we say across the country, we mean a very long distance in the United States.  “The kids were really excited,” the story says, and the “oldest son wanted to help navigate.”  To navigate, “navigate,” means to guide, to give people directions on where they should go. We use that term, navigate, for a plane.  There is usually one person on a plane that is the navigator; that would be the noun from the verb to navigate.  You would also have someone who navigates a ship.  Here we use it for a car, to show or to indicate where you should go.

“Before the trip, we looked at the road maps.”  The road maps, are, as you could guess, maps that tell you where the freeways, the highways, the streets are. “We looked at the road map and decided on our route and points of interest.”  To decide on something means that you made a decision to do something.  You could say, “We decided to take” a certain route, and there we would use the verb in the “to” form, decide to do something.  But, if we are using a noun or a noun phrase, then we use the preposition “on.” So I decided on the blue car instead of the red car.  That means I decided to buy the blue car instead of the red car.

Well, in this story, the family decided on the route.  The route, “route,” is the path or the roads and streets, in this case, that you are going to go on to get to your city or wherever you are going.  The place where you are going we usually call the destination, “destination.”  That's the place where you are going.  Well, the destination could take you on different routes.  So if I was going from Los Angeles to San Francisco in Northern California, I could take the freeway number five, or I could take the highway number one.  Those will both get me to San Francisco.  So there are different routes.  Points of interest are places where you want to stop and see something.  That might be a park, it might be a monument, it might be a interesting place for you, those would be points of interest.

Well, since we were not “taking a camper, we needed to make hotel reservations.”  A camper, “camper,” is like a big truck or vehicle that has places for you to sleep in.  Often, the car pulls this vehicle.  That would be called a

 camper.  Well, we're not having a camper, we're not taking a camper on this trip, so we made hotel reservations.

The first day, the children “were behaving themselves.”  To behave, “behave,” means to act nicely, and this is usually a verb we use when we are talking about children or young students.  The opposite of to behave is to misbehave, “misbehave.”  So, when we say, “the kids were behaving themselves,” we mean they were acting nice; they were being good.  There are other ways to use that verb, to behave, and we talk about those in today's Learning Guide.

“My daughter was a little car sick,” the story says.  To be carsick usually is a type of motion sickness, where when you move in the car, some people, the motion of the car - the movement of the car - makes their stomach a little sick.  They start to feel a little sick.  That happens to people in the plane, or on a ship or boat.

Well, “we made it to our first stop without any major problems.”  Our first stop would be the first place where we were going to sleep overnight somewhere. “On the second day,” the kids began to misbehave.  Another way of saying misbehave is to act up, “act up,” two words.  To act up means to misbehave, especially for children.  The children “kept asking, 'Are we there yet?'“ meaning have we arrived, because, of course, children don't like to wait.  They want everything right away, and so if you if you have a long trip, they may say, “Are we there yet?” - have we arrived?

“And they wanted to stop at every rest stop.”  A rest stop is a place on a big highway or freeway where you can stop and use the bathroom, and usually there are places where you can eat, and these are on the side of the big freeways. Usually, between large cities, you will find some rest stops every 40, 50 miles.

“My youngest son,” the story says, “kept calling out the mile markers.”  To call out means to say out loud, and in this case, the son is calling out the mile markers. On most U.S. highways and freeways there's a little sign for every mile that tells you the mile number of that particular freeway.  It can sometimes be the number of miles from the border of the state.  When you have a highway or a freeway that goes between two states, the mile markers usually start at one again at the border.  Well, they start at zero.  The border would be zero, and the first mile into the state would be one.

 The mile markers, then, were being called out, or announced out loud, by the youngest son, “and I thought my head would explode if he didn’t stop.”  To explode, “explode,” means literally, actually that something blows apart.  For example, if you had a tire for your bike - the round piece of rubber that goes around the wheel - and you kept putting air into the tire and you didn't stop. Eventually the tire would explode, it would break open.  And, that's the idea of the verb, to explode.  We usually use that verb to talk about bombs such as you would find in a war, but the expression, my head would explode, means that I was getting a headache.  My head was starting to hurt.  “On top of that,” or in addition to that, “my wife wanted every few miles for a photo op.”  A photo op is short for a photograph opportunity.  In other words, my wife wanted to take a picture every few miles in our trip.

“By the third day, I was really questioning the wisdom of taking” my young children on a trip “for 10 days.”  To question the wisdom is the same as to doubt, or “I was thinking this is a bad idea.”  When you question the wisdom of something you begin to doubt if it is a good idea or not.

The story ends by the narrator saying, “I suspect that after this vacation,” meaning I think, I believe that after this vacation I'm pretty sure “I’ll need another” vacation “to recover from it.”  To recover, “recover,” means to get better.  We usually use that verb when we are talking about being sick.  But here, in the story, he's sort of making a joke, saying he needs to recover from this vacation, meaning he needs to get some rest, to get better after the difficult vacation.  To recover means something different if you are talking about a thing or an object, and that's something we talk about in today's Learning Guide.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Our family decided to take a road trip across the country this year.  The kids were really excited and my oldest son wanted to help navigate.  Before the trip, we looked at the road maps and decided on our route and the points of interest we would try to see.  Since we wouldn’t be taking a camper, we needed to make hotel reservations along the way.  After a little planning, we were ready to go.

The kids were behaving themselves the first day.  My daughter was a little car sick in the morning, but we made it to our first stop without any major problems.

 On the second day, though, the kids were really acting up.  They kept asking, “Are we there yet?” and they wanted to stop at every rest stop.  My youngest son, who is only four, kept calling out the mile markers as we passed them, and I thought my head would explode if he didn’t stop.  On top of that, my wife wanted to stop every few miles for a photo op and I thought we’d never get to the next town.

By the third day, I was really questioning the wisdom of taking three young children on the road for 10 days.  I suspect that after this vacation, I’ll need another one to recover from it.

# Giving Bad News and Condolences

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 211, “Giving Bad News and Condolences.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 211.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  We have some new features that we think you will enjoy.  You can download the Learning Guide for this episode, where you will find all of the vocabulary, definitions, additional words that we don't talk about on the podcast and a complete transcript of this episode.

We're talking today about how to give some bad news to someone and to offer condolences.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I was at the hospital at with my friend, Wendy.  Her father was in an accident and she was waiting to talk to the doctor.

Doctor:  Hello, I’m Dr. Johnson.  How are you holding up?

Wendy:  Oh, I’m fine.  Is there any news?

Doctor:  Yes.  I have examined your father’s test results and I’m afraid the news isn’t good.  His condition has deteriorated rapidly, and I want you to prepare for the worst.

Wendy:  You’re not saying that he won’t recover, are you?

Doctor:  We can hope for the best, but your father may only have a few days.  I’m very sorry.

Wendy:  Can I see my father?

Doctor:  Yes, of course. .......

 The worst did happen and Wendy’s father passed away the following week.  At both the wake and the funeral, we all tried to console Wendy by saying things like, “I’m sorry for your loss,” “Please accept my condolences,” and “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”

The funeral director made sure that the funeral service went smoothly.  The eulogy was short and I went with Wendy to the burial.  It was a difficult time for Wendy but hopefully, having her family and friends with her made it more bearable.

[End of story]

Today's podcast is called “Giving Bad News and Condolences.”

We usually use the verb offer with the noun condolences.  What are condolences, “condolences?”  Condolences are when someone dies and you want to say something nice to them.  That is offering your condolences.  Be sure to look at today's Learning Guide for more information, cultural information about funerals, what happens when people die in the United States.

Our happy story begins, we're at the hospital and I'm with my friend, Wendy.  Her father was in some sort of accident - something happened to him, perhaps a car accident - and Wendy was waiting to talk to the doctor.  The doctor comes and says, “Hello, I’m Dr. Johnson.”  He introduces himself, and he asks Wendy, “How are you holding up?”  “How are you holding up?” is a question you would ask to someone who is having a very difficult time, someone who is usually the friend or the family of someone who is sick, or perhaps someone who is dying.  “How are you holding up?” means how are you feeling, how are you doing under these very difficult situations or difficult circumstances

Wendy says, “Oh, I’m fine,” and asks the doctor if there is “any news,” is there anything new to tell her.  The doctor says, “Yes,” that he has examined, or he's looked at, Wendy's “father's test results.”  Test results, in a hospital, would be when you have your blood analyzed or other parts of your body, other things that the laboratory looks at.  They use the expression, “to run some tests,” means to conduct or to do some tests on you.  Well, the doctor has looked at the test results.  He says, “I'm afraid the news isn't good.”  The expression “I'm afraid” is one that we use when you are going to give someone some bad news.  Your girlfriend may say to you, “I'm afraid I just want to be your friend, not your

 girlfriend.”  That is the very bad news that many men receive, and sometimes, if the woman is nice, she'll say, “I'm afraid,” meaning I'm going to tell you some bad news and I'm sorry to have to tell you.

The doctor says that Wendy's father's “condition has deteriorated rapidly.”  To deteriorate, “deteriorate,” means to get worse.  So, when the doctor says his “condition has deteriorated rapidly,” or quickly, he means that he has gotten much worse.  The doctor says, “I want you to prepare for the worst.”  To prepare for the worst, “worst,” means that she should prepare herself for the worst thing that could happen to her father, in this case, her father could die.  So, he says, “prepare for the worst” - get yourself mentally, psychologically ready for this possibility.

Wendy then says you aren't “saying that he won't recover, are you?”  To recover, “recover,” means to get better.  So, Wendy says are you saying that my father won't get better?  And the doctor said, “We can hope for the best.”  To hope for the best means to hope that the best possible result or best possible situation happens.  Notice that the expression “prepare for the worst,” “hope for the best” are sort of opposites.  The worst is the superlative.  We say something is bad, something is worse, something is worst.  Worst would be the most negative thing that could happen, and the opposite would be good, better and best, best being the most positive thing that could happen.  Wendy asks if she can see her father, and the doctor says, “of course.”

Our story continues, and we learn that Wendy's “father passed away the following,” or the next “week.”  To pass, “pass,” away, “away,” means to die.  It's a nice way of saying to die.  So, you would say to your friend, “I'm sorry to hear that your father has passed away.”  You would say that instead of saying, “I'm sorry to hear he died.”  Passed away just sounds better.  It sounds nicer somehow.

Don't confuse pass away with pass over or pass up.  These are different verbs. There are many different types of these two word verbs in English.  In today's Learning Guide we explain the difference between some of these verbs that use the word pass.

Well, “At the wake and the funeral, we all tried to console Wendy.”  The wake, “wake,” is a small gathering when the friends of the person who has died, and the family, come together, usually in a place called a funeral home.  A funeral home

 is a place where you take the body before it gets put into the ground.  And, people can come and see the body, and in some religious traditions people pray for the person who died.  That's called a wake, and usually in the United States it's the night before the day the person is going to be put into the ground, the person is going to be buried.  So, if you're having someone buried on Thursday, the wake would be Wednesday evening.  That's the use of the word wake as a noun.  As a verb, wake means something very different, and you'll want to look at today's Learning Guide to see that explanation.

The funeral, “funeral,” is the actual ceremony, the actual service.  Usually in the United States it's a religious service, but it could just be people getting together and talking about the person.  It's common at these funerals to have someone stand up and talk about the person who died.  We call that talk, or that speech, a eulogy, “eulogy.”

Well, at the funeral and the wake, we “tried to console Wendy.”  To console, “console,” is to try to make someone feel better, or feel happier after something terrible has happened, like a death.  We often use this verb when someone dies and you try to console the wife or console the children.  You try to make them feel better.  And normally, you do this by telling them things, by saying things, and we hear three possible ways of consoling, or offering your condolences. One is, “I'm sorry for your loss” - I'm sorry that you have lost your husband.  We use that verb, to lose, when we talk about someone who dies.  So, if a woman says, “I lost my husband,” she doesn't mean her husband couldn't find his way back home, she means that her husband died, her husband passed away.  So, you can say to someone, “I'm sorry for your loss.”

You can also say, “Please accept my condolences.”  Please accept, “accept,” my condolences.  You offer someone your condolences, and that person accepts your condolences.  When you say, “Please accept my condolences,” you're saying the same thing as, “I'm sorry for your loss.”

The third expression you can use is “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”  “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time,” meaning I'm thinking about you.  I haven't forgotten about you.  In certain religious families, you might say, “My prayers are with you,” or “You are in our prayers,” meaning I'm praying for you.  I'm praying for the person who died.  But a more general expression would be, “My thoughts are with you.”

 The story ends by saying that “The funeral director” - the person who is the head of the funeral home, the place that takes care of the body before it is buried into the ground - “The funeral director made sure that the funeral service went smoothly.  The funeral service is the same as the funeral.  It's the ceremony that you have, when people talk and perhaps say prayers for the person who died.

“The eulogy,” the speech about the person who died, “was short.”  “I went with Wendy to the burial.”  The burial, “burial,” is when you put the body into the ground.  Of course, you don't put the body into the ground just by itself, you put it in a box, and that box is called a coffin, “coffin.”

I end the story by saying that with Wendy “having her friends and family” close to her, we hope that it “made it more bearable.”  To be bearable, “bearable,” means that it was not as difficult.  It was not as sad.  Something that is bearable is something that you can...you can experience, even though it's painful it...it is better than the worst possible situation.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

I was at the hospital at with my friend, Wendy.  Her father was in an accident and she was waiting to talk to the doctor.

Doctor:  Hello, I’m Dr. Johnson.  How are you holding up?

Wendy:  Oh, I’m fine.  Is there any news?

Doctor:  Yes.  I have examined your father’s test results and I’m afraid the news isn’t good.  His condition has deteriorated rapidly, and I want you to prepare for the worst.

Wendy:  You’re not saying that he won’t recover, are you?

Doctor:  We can hope for the best, but your father may only have a few days.  I’m very sorry.

Wendy:  Can I see my father?

 Doctor:  Yes, of course. .......

The worst did happen and Wendy’s father passed away the following week.  At both the wake and the funeral, we all tried to console Wendy by saying things like, “I’m sorry for your loss,” “Please accept my condolences,” and “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”

The funeral director made sure that the funeral service went smoothly.  The eulogy was short and I went with Wendy to the burial.  It was a difficult time for Wendy but hopefully, having her family and friends with her made it more bearable.

# Asking for a Raise

complete transcript of this episode.

Today we are going to talk about asking for a raise at work.  Let's go.

[Start of story]

Patty:  Alberto, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Alberto:  Yeah, sure, but you’ll have to make it quick.  I’m going into a meeting at 3.

Patty:  Sure.  Hopefully, this won’t take long.  I’m thinking about asking for a raise.  I’ve been working here for a year and half, and I now have a lot more responsibilities on my plate than when I started.  I think I’ve earned a raise, but I don’t know how to broach the issue with Wayne.  I can’t just go into his office and say, “Give me a raise!”

Alberto:  You’re right.  It’s not an easy thing to bring up.  One thing I did when I asked for a raise last year was to remind Wayne of my qualifications and all of the work I do around here.  I tried to convince Wayne that I was indispensable.

Patty:  Obviously it worked.  You got a raise and a promotion, too.  All I want is a bump in pay.

Alberto:  The trick is to sell yourself without seeming self-serving.  And, you don’t want to give any ultimatums either.  That definitely won’t fly with Wayne.

 Patty:  I can see that.  I plan to talk to him at the end of the week so wish me luck.

Alberto:  You don’t need it.  I’m sure Wayne will see things your way.

[End of story]

Our podcast is called, “Aski ng for a Raise.”  A raise, “raise,” is when you want more money for the job that you do for someone.  To ask for a raise means to ask for more money, to be paid more money at your job.

Our dialogue is between Patty and Alberto.  Patty asks Alberto, “Can I pick your brain for a minute?”  To pick, “pick,” can mean to take and remove something, so when you say to someone, “I want to pick your brain,” you're saying I want to get some ideas from your brain.  I want you to give me some ideas.  Your brain, of course, is what is, well, what should be in your head.  Some people have it other places!  So, to pick your brain means to get ideas, to get your opinion about something.

Alberto says, “Yeah, sure,” okay, “but you’ll have to make it quick.”  When someone says, “make it quick,” they mean don't take a very much time.  You have to hurry.  I'm busy and I have to go, so make it quick:  speak quickly, tell me quickly what you want to tell me.  The opposite of make it quick would be take your time.  If someone says, “Take your time,” they mean you can go slowly. Alberto doesn't say take your time, he says, “make it quick.  I'm going into a meeting at three,” at three o'clock.

Patty says that she's been “thinking about a raise.”  She has been working at the company for a year and half, and now she has more things to do, more responsibilities on her plate.  When we say I have more things or more responsibility on my plate, “plate,” we mean that I have many more things that I am doing, many more projects, many more tasks that I am responsible for.  You can think of your plate like a plate that you would eat your food off of, so to have more things on the plate means that you have more things that you have to do.

Patty says that she thinks she's “earned a raise.”  To earn a raise, “earn,” here means that she deserves a raise, that she should get a raise because she has done the work required in order to get more money.  However, she says that she doesn't “know how to broach the issue with Wayne.”  To broach, “broach,” means

 the same as to begin talking about.  We may also use the verb here, to raise.  As a verb, not as a noun, we use raise to mean the same as broach, to begin talking about something, to be the first one to start talking about something.  This is the same meaning as the expression to bring up.  To bring, “bring,” up, two words, means to raise, to start talking about.  The verb to bring up actually has a couple of different meanings.  Look today's Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those meanings.

Alberto says, “It’s not an easy thing to bring up.”  It's not an easy thing to broach. “One thing I did when I asked for a raise,” he says, was to tell Wayne, “to remind Wayne of” his “qualifications.”  Your qualifications, “qualifications,” plural, your qualifications are your skills, your knowledge - the things that make you good at your job or the things that makes you able to do your job.  Someone might say, “I went to the university and I have a bachelor's degree in engineering.  I have good qualifications for this job.”  I have the things this job requires.

Alberto says that he tried to convince the boss, Wayne, that he was indispensable.  To be indispensable, “indispensable,” means that you cannot do without this person, that you must have this person.  The opposite of indispensable is dispensable, and that, what we would call prefix that comes at the beginning of a word, the prefix “in” means not, in many cases.  So, when we say someone is indispensable, we mean that they are not dispensable.  If you say something is inconvenient, you mean it is not convenient.

Patty says that obviously, or clearly, Alberto's strategy, what Alberto did, worked because he “got a raise and a promotion.”  A promotion, “promotion,” is when you get a better job, usually a job that is higher up.  You move up, we might say, in the company, you have a higher position in the company.  Promotion is almost always used to talk about people in a job or at work.  You can get a promotion without a raise, and you can get a raise without a promotion.  A raise is more money.  A promotion is a higher position in the company.  I have a high position at the Center for Educational Development, but I have never gotten a raise.

Well, Patty says also that she wants “a bump in pay.”  A bump, “bump,” means here an increase.  She wants an increase in pay.  zit means the same as a raise. Alberto says, “The trick,” or the best approach, “is to sell yourself without seeming self-serving.”  To sell yourself means to convince someone else that you are the best person, that you deserve what you are asking for.  To be self- serving, “self-serving,” means that you are only interested in yourself.  You're not

 interested in other people, and therefore you may not be trustworthy.  If you say things that are self-serving, they are only going to be good for you.  They're only going to benefit you.

Alberto warns Patty that she should not “give any ultimatums.”  An ultimatum, “ultimatum,” is a demand.  When you say to someone, “If you do not give me a raise, I will quit,” that is an ultimatum.  You're saying if something doesn't happen then you will do something else.  Alberto says that ultimatums “definitely won't fly with Wayne.”  When we say something won't fly, “fly,” we mean they won't work. There are other very different meanings of the verb, to fly.  Take a look at today's Learning Guide for more explanation of those.

Patty says that she can see what Alberto means, she understands what he means, and that she is going to talk to Wayne next week.  Alberto says that he is sure that Wayne, their boss, will see things Patty's way.  To see things (someone's) way, or to see things your way, in the case of the dialogue, means that he will agree with you.  It means when someone will look at a situation, will understand a situation the same way you look at it, the same way you understand it.  The opposite of that would be to have someone who doesn't see eye to eye with you.  The expression to be unable or not to see eye, “eye,” to eye means that you don't agree with someone.  But, in the dialogue, Alberto says that Wayne will see things the same way.

The whole topic of how Americans get promotions and raises is an interesting one.  We have a discussion of that in our culture note in today's Learning Guide.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Patty:  Alberto, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Alberto:  Yeah, sure, but you’ll have to make it quick.  I’m going into a meeting at 3.

Patty:  Sure.  Hopefully, this won’t take long.  I’m thinking about asking for a raise.  I’ve been working here for a year and half, and I now have a lot more responsibilities on my plate than when I started.  I think I’ve earned a raise, but I

 don’t know how to broach the issue with Wayne.  I can’t just go into his office and say, “Give me a raise!”

Alberto:  You’re right.  It’s not an easy thing to bring up.  One thing I did when I asked for a raise last year was to remind Wayne of my qualifications and all of the work I do around here.  I tried to convince Wayne that I was indispensable.

Patty:  Obviously it worked.  You got a raise and a promotion, too.  All I want is a bump in pay.

Alberto:  You don’t need it.  I’m sure Wayne will see things your way.

# A Jealous Girlfriend

complete transcript of this podcast.

Today's podcast is called, “A Jealous Girlfriend.”  Sounds interesting.  Here we go!

[Start of story]

Sarya:  Hey Dom, I haven’t seen you in so long.  Where have you been?

Dominick:  Oh, I’ve been busy.

Sarya:  I’ve missed hanging out together.  How’s Leslie?

Dominick:  She’s okay, but things haven’t been that great between us.

Sarya:  I’m really sorry to hear that.  What’s up?

Dominick:  Leslie is great, but she’s so jealous of my friends, especially my female friends.  She doesn’t like it when I see them or even if I talk to them on the phone.  To be honest, that’s why I haven’t called you lately.

Sarya:  I got the feeling that you’ve been avoiding me.  Now I understand that it’s the green-eyed monster at work.  Have you been doing anything to make her jealous?

Dominick:  No!  I go out with my friends sometimes but I’m always up front with Leslie and tell her what I’m doing.  But, she’s so possessive.  Even when I go out

 with my guy friends, she flips out sometimes.  I don’t know why she won’t trust me.

Sarya:  Maybe she’s just insecure about herself, or maybe she feels insecure about your relationship.  But either way, I’d stop this in its tracks before it gets any worse.  Have you talked to her about it?

Dominick:  Not really.  We usually get into a big fight and then we make up, but we don’t ever get at the root of the matter.

Sarya:  I wish I could help.

Dominick:  You already have.  Talking about it helps.  Whatever it takes, I’m going to get this under control.  Other than this jealousy problem, we have a great relationship.  I don’t want anything to jeopardize it.

Sarya:  Good luck with everything and let me know if I there’s anything I can do.

Dominick:  Thanks.  I will.

[End of story]

The podcast we just listened to is called, “A Jealous Girlfriend.”  To be jealous, “jealous,” means to want something that someone else has.  Usually when we say a jealous girlfriend or a jealous boyfriend we mean that the girlfriend or boyfriend doesn't like his or her partner, doesn't like the other person, to be seen with other women or other men.  So, a jealous girlfriend wants to keep her boyfriend to herself and doesn't want the boyfriend talking to or getting involved with other women.  To be jealous means to want something for yourself and for no one else to have it.  It's similar to the word envious, “envious.”  To be envious means to want something that someone else has.

Our dialogue begins by the friend of Dominick saying, “Hey Dom, I haven’t seen you in so long.  Where have you been?”  Dom, “Dom,” is short here for Dominick. So, she says, I have not seen you in a long time, and Dominick says that he's “been busy.”  This is something we often use as an excuse in English.  When we don't want to talk to someone we say, “Oh, I've been busy.  I'm too busy.  I have too much to do.”  Dominick's friend Sarya says, “I’ve missed hanging out together.”  To hang out, “hang out,” two words, means to spend time together.

 So, when two people spend time together having fun, not working but relaxing, going to movies, talking - that is hanging out.  It's an informal term to mean spend time together.

Sarya asks about the Leslie, who is Dominick's girlfriend.  Dominick says, “She’s okay, but things haven’t been that great between us.”  In other words, we've been having problems.  Sarya says, “I’m sorry to hear that.  What’s up?”  When someone tells you bad news, it's common for you to say, “Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.”  Well, Dominick explains that Leslie is very jealous of Dominick's friends, especially his female friends.  Of course, once you get into a relationship - once you have a girlfriend - the other female friends that you have may cause your girlfriend to be jealous.  So, men, watch out!  Back to the story.

Dominick says that she doesn't like it when he sees or talks to other women.  If he sees them or talks to them on the phone, she gets jealous.  He says, “To be honest,” or honestly, “that’s why I haven’t called you lately.”  So, he tells her the truth.  To be honest, to tell the truth, honestly - all of those expressions mean that I'm going to tell you the truth.

Sarya says, “I got the feeling that you’ve been avoiding me,” meaning that's what I thought.  I knew that you were not talking to me.  To avoid, “avoid,” someone means to not talk to them, to not see them, to try not to have any contact with them.  No commu nication.  You may say, “I'm avoiding my friend Joe because I owe him ten dollars.”  He gave me ten dollars and now I need to give it back, and I don't have ten dollars so I'm going to avoid him.  This is the way I do it!

Sarya says, “Now I understand that it’s the green-eyed monster at work.”  The expression green-eyed monster, “green-eyed,” monster, “monster,” means that it's the person being jealous.  A monster is someone like Frankenstein, someone who is very large, ugly, someone that could scare you.  This is an imaginary person, kind of like the host of ESL Podcast - big, ugly!  A monster, then, is a bad thing, something that would scare you.  The color green is the color that we use to indicate someone is jealous or someone is envious.  I'm not sure why green, but we use the color green.  We have an expression, “He's green with envy,” meaning he's very jealous, he's very envious.  The green-eyed monster, then, would be this monster that is very jealous, very envious, and it's an expression, an informal expression to mean, simply, jealousy.

 Sarya says to Dominick, Have you done anything to make your girlfriend jealous? In other words, what have you been doing, Dominick?  And Dominick says, “No!” He says he has not done anything.  He goes out with his friends - to go out with here means the same as to hang out with - but he says he's “always up front with Leslie.”  When you are up front with someone, you are honest with them, you are direct with them, you tell them the truth right away.

He says he's “up front with Leslie,” but Leslie, his girlfriend is very “possessive.” To be possessive, “possessive,” means something similar to being jealous.  To be possessive means that you want to have something for yourself.  To possess, as a verb, means to own, to have something.  You can say, “I possess three shirts,” or “I possess a good sense of humor” - whatever you, whatever you own, whatever you have.  So, Leslie is being possessive, it means she wants something and she doesn't want anyone else to have it, and that's the way she feels about Dominick.  You can think of possessive as wanting something for yourself, your things and no one else can have them.  To be jealous means that you want something that someone else has.  So, there is a small difference between them.

Dominick says that even when he goes out with his guy friends - the word guy, “guy,” means male or man friends - even when he goes out with his friends who are men, Leslie “flips out.”  To flip, “flip,” out, “out,” means to get very - in this case, very angry.  They go crazy.  It's the opposite of staying calm.  Dominick says, “I don't know why” my girlfriend doesn't “trust me.”  To trust, “trust,” in this sentence means to have confidence in someone, to have faith in someone, to believe that someone is telling the truth, for example.  Trust has a couple of other different meanings in English.  We talk about those on today's Learning Guide.

Sarya says that, “Maybe” Leslie is “just insecure about herself.”  When you say someone is insecure, “insecure,” you mean that they don't have confidence in themselves.  They don't feel confident about themselves.  Sarya says that Dominick should “stop this in its tracks before it gets any worse.”  To stop something in its tracks, “tracks,” means to end something before it becomes a problem, to stop something before the problem gets more serious.

Dominick says that usually they “get into a big fight,” and afterwards they “make up.”  To make up, “make up,” two words, means to get over an argument, to become friends again, to be nice to each other again.  Again, this word has a lot

 of different meanings - make up.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for today for those additional meanings.

Dominick says that he and his girlfriend, when they have a fight, never get to “the root of the matter.”  To get to the root, “root,” of the matter means to get to the cause of the problem, to get to the real reason why they are having this difficulty.

Dominick thanks Sarya for her help.  He says, “Whatever it takes, I’m going to get this under control.”  Whatever it takes is an expression that means I will do anything or anything and everything that has to be done I will do.  To get something under control means to get it to a normal condition, to a situation that you can manage.  The opposite of under control is not over control, it's out of control.  So, if you say something is out of control, you mean you do not have it manageable.  It is something that you cannot take care of, you cannot handle.  In this case, Dominick is saying he wants to get it under control.  He wants to be able to manage it correctly.

He says he doesn't want to do “anything to jeopardize” his relationship with his girlfriend.  To jeopardize, “jeopardize,” means to put something in danger, to put something in a situation that might harm you or harm the relationship, in this case.

There are several popular television shows in the United States that talk about relationships and problems that boyfriends and girlfriends have, and in our Learning Guide today we have a whole cultural note about those programs.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Sarya:  Hey Dom, I haven’t seen you in so long.  Where have you been?

Dominick:  Oh, I’ve been busy.

Sarya:  I’ve missed hanging out together.  How’s Leslie?

Dominick:  She’s okay, but things haven’t been that great between us.

Sarya:  I’m really sorry to hear that.  What’s up?

 Dominick:  Leslie is great, but she’s so jealous of my friends, especially my female friends.  She doesn’t like it when I see them or even if I talk to them on the phone.  To be honest, that’s why I haven’t called you lately.

Sarya:  I got the feeling that you’ve been avoiding me.  Now I understand that it’s the green-eyed monster at work.  Have you been doing anything to make her jealous?

Dominick:  No!   I go out with my friends sometimes but I’m always up front with Leslie and tell her what I’m doing.  But, she’s so possessive.  Even when I go out with my guy friends, she flips out sometimes.  I don’t know why she won’t trust me.

Sarya:  Maybe she’s just insecure about herself, or maybe she feels insecure about your relationship.  But either way, I’d stop this in its tracks before it gets any worse.  Have you talked to her about it?

Dominick:  Not really.  We usually get into a big fight and then we make up, but we don’t ever get at the root of the matter.

Sarya:  I wish I could help.

Dominick:  You already have.  Talking about it helps.  Whatever it takes, I’m going to get this under control.  Other than this jealousy problem, we have a great relationship.  I don’t want anything to jeopardize it.

Sarya:  Good luck with everything and let me know if I there’s anything I can do.

Dominick:  Thanks.  I will.

# Getting a Men¡¦s Haircut

complete transcript of this episode.  It also includes all of the words, definitions, sample sentences and culture notes related to this episode.

Today's podcast is called, “Getting a Men’s Haircut.”  Let's go!

[Start of story]

It’s been almost three months since I got a haircut and I went to the barbershop where I always get it cut.  But when I got there, the barbershop had been replaced by a hair salon.

Shinobu:  Hi, I used to get my hair cut at the barbershop that was here.

Nicole:  Yeah, they closed.  We’ve been open for about a month.  I can cut your hair.

Shinobu:  Uh...I guess that’s okay.

Nicole:  Why don’t you come over here and sit down.  What do you have in mind?

Shinobu:  Well, as you can see, my hair is pretty curly.  When it’s long, it looks like an Afro.  I want it to be a lot shorter, but I don’t want a buzz cut.

 Nicole:  Are you sure you want to cut it?  If you keep it long, you could have great dreadlocks.

Shinobu:  Uh, I’m not sure that that style would work for me.

Nicole:  Okay, then.  How about if I cut it short on the sides, leave the bangs medium length, and then keep the back long?

Shinobu:  No, I don’t think that would work, either.  I’d like it an inch off the collar in back, above the ears, no sideburns, with a part down the right side.  I really just need a trim.

Nicole:  Hmm…h ow about if I shave your head?  You’d look great bald.

Shinobu:  No!  I definitely don’t want that.  You know what, I just remembered that I’m supposed to be somewhere else right now.

Nicole:  Oh, are you sure?  I’m sure I know exactly what you want.

Shinobu:  I’m sure you do, but I really have to go.

I left that hair salon as quickly as I could.  Who knows what would have happened if I’d stayed there?  She may have given me a Mohawk!

[End of story]

We're getting our hair cut in this episode of the podcast.  The story begins with Shinobu saying that, “It has been almost three months since” he had his hair cut last and he goes to a “barbershop where” he “always gets it cut.”  A barbershop, “barbershop,” all one word, is a place where men get their hair cut.  A barber is the person who cuts the hair, and a barbershop is the place where you go to get a haircut, especially if you're a man.

The story continues by Shinobu saying that the barbershop was gone when he went back and it “had been replaced by a hair salon.”  A hair salon, “salon,” is a place where women get their hair cut, although men can also get their hair cut, sometimes, at a hair salon.  Many men do, especially men who live in big cities where the man is concerned about his hair and how it looks.  We have a special

 cultural note in our Learning Guide today about those kind of men.  Take it look at that.  I think you'll find it interesting.

The dialogue begins with Shinobu saying to Nicole, the woman who works at the hair salon, that he “used to get” his “hair cut at the barbershop.”  Nicole says that the barbershop is closed, but that she can cut his hair.  Now, you can tell Shinobu is not quite sure he wants her to cut his hair, but he says okay.  Nicole then asks him to come and sit down and then says, “What do you have in mind?” meaning what are you thinking?  What are your ideas?

Shinobu says, “Well, my hair is pretty curly.”  When we say hair is curly, “curly,” we mean it's not straight.  It's like in little circles.  Curly is the opposite of straight hair.  Shinobu says that when his hair is “long, it looks like an Afro.”  An Afro, “Afro,” is when you have very curly hair that sticks out of your head. that comes out of your head, almost like a stick, and so you have this big bowl, almost, of hair above you.  This was a hairstyle popular in the 1960’s, especially among some African American men.

Well, Shinobu says that he wants his hair cut short, but he doesn't “want a buzz cut.”  A buzz, “buzz,” cut is when your hair is cut very close to your head. that you only have just little bit of hair.  The reason it is called a buzz cut is because normally it is done with an electric razor.  A razor, “razor,” is the little machine that has like scissors in it, we would call them blades, “blades” - those are the things that actually cut the hair - and an electric razor makes a sound that sounds like “buzzzzz, ” and so it's called a buzz cut.  And, it is something that when you join the military - the army, for example, in the United States - you are given a buzz cut.  They cut off all your hair and get it very short.  It's not the same as taking all of the hair off.  They leave a little bit of hair on your head.  My father, when we were growing up, used to cut our hair with a buzz cut.  He would have an electric razor and he would just take our hair off, just like we were in the army.

Well, Nicole says, “Are you sure you want to cut” your hair?  She suggests to Shinobu that he “keep it long,” and he “could have great dreadlocks.” Dreadlocks, “dreadlocks,” one word, is when you have long hair, long curly hair, but it goes down.  It's like having strings of hair that go down towards your shoulder.  You can think of the famous reggae musicians, such as Bob Marley. He had a...he had dreadlocks.

 Well, Shinobu says that he doesn't think that is a good idea for him.  Nicole suggests then that she cut his hair “short on the sides,” leaving “the bangs medium and the back long.”  When we talk about the sides we mean the part of the head above the ear, between the ear and the top of the head on the right side and the left side.  The bangs, “bangs,” are the hairs that go over the top of your head, the forehead, or front of your head.  That word, bangs, has many different meanings in English, look at the Learning Guide for some additional definitions of that.

Shinobu says that he doesn't think that's a good idea either.  He says, “I don't think that would work.”  I don't think it would look good on me.  He tells Nicole that he wants the hair “an inch off the collar.”  The collar, “collar,” is actually the top of your shirt.  So, when he says to Nicole I want “it an inch off the collar,” he means he wants it an inch above the collar, that the hair should stop one inch above his collar.  When I was in high school, this was the rule, that all of the boys had to have their hair cut one inch above the collar.  No long hair was allowed.

He also says that he wants the hair cut “above the ears,” meaning that there should be no hair covering the ears.  He says he wants “no sideburns.” Sideburns, “sideburns,” one word, is hair that goes on the side of your face, left side and right side, but it goes down like a line down the sides of your face.  This was a very popular style back in the 1970’s, to have sideburns.  Well, Shinobu says he does not want to have sideburns, he wants “a part down the right side.” A part, “part,” is the line in the hair where you divide it.  So, you comb it one way on one side of the part and another way on the other side of the part.  You can have a part down the middle.  You can have a part down the right side of your head or the left side of your head.  That word, part, has many different meanings in English.  Again, look at today's Learning Guide for some additional definitions of that word.

Shinobu says, he “really just” wants “a trim.”  When you go to the barbershop or hair salon and say you want a trim, “trim,” you're saying you just want your hair cut a little.  You're not looking to have the whole thing done.

Nicole says, “how about if I shave your head?  You’d look great bald.”  How about means do you like this idea or do you want me to shave your head?  To shave, “shave,” means to remove all of your hair so you have no hair at all. Usually you have to use a razor, what we would call a hand razor that has one blade that...or two blades that cut the hair right to your skin.  And, if you do that, if

 you have no hair, we say you are bald, “bald.”  If you want to see what bald looks like, just take a look at the ESL Podcast Special Edition, our one year anniversary video, and you will see what a bald head looks like.

Shinobu says that he doesn't want to have his head shaved.  He realizes that this was not a good idea to go to the hair salon, so he gives Nicole an excuse.  He says, “I just remembered that I’m supposed to be somewhere else right now.” This is kind of a typical excuse that you would tell someone if you want to leave right away.  “Oh, I have to go!”  I have to be somewhere else right now.  I'm supposed to be somewhere else right now.

Nicole says, “Oh, are you sure?  I know exactly what you want,” and Shinobu says that he has to go.  At the end of the dialogue he says that he's not sure what would have happened if he had stayed at the hair salon.  He says maybe she would give him a Mohawk.  A Mohawk, “Mohawk,” is a style of hair, a haircut where you shave the head on the sides but you leave an inch or two of hair going down the middle of your head.  It's called a Mohawk after an American Indian tribe, the Mohawk tribe, although actually it was not the style used by the Mohawks.  That’s a mistake, but we still call it a Mohawk.  This was very popular in the late 1970’s among punk rockers, musicians who played punk style of rock music.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

It’s been almost three months since I got a haircut and I went to the barbershop where I always get it cut.  But when I got there, the barbershop had been replaced by a hair salon.

Shinobu:  Hi, I used to get my hair cut at the barbershop that was here.

Nicole:  Yeah, they closed.  We’ve been open for about a month.  I can cut your hair.

Shinobu:  Uh...I guess that’s okay.

Nicole:  Why don’t you come over here and sit down.  What do you have in mind?

 Shinobu:  Well, as you can see, my hair is pretty curly.  When it’s long, it looks like an Afro.  I want it to be a lot shorter, but I don’t want a buzz cut.

Nicole:  Are you sure you want to cut it?  If you keep it long, you could have great dreadlocks.

# Outsourcing Operations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 216,  “Outsourcing Operations.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 216.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com to find more information about this podcast, additional services we offer and a complete Learning Guide to this episode.  The Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary, additional words, explanations, sample sentences, cultural notes and a complete transcript of this episode.

This podcast is about a business that tries to hire, or get, another company to do part of their work.  It's called “Outsourcing Operations.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Bonnie:  I wanted us to meet today to talk about ways to reduce our overhead. One suggestion is for us to outsource some of our operations.  I’d like to hear what you think are the pros and cons of doing that.

Jean-Luc:  I think that, in principle, it’s a good idea.  It would save us a lot of money, but I see a downside.  We would lose control of some of our key in house operations.

Bonnie:  Well, I think that we want to focus on non-core operations, such as IT or accounting.  I know that other companies have outsourced their call centers, but that would take a lot of training, especially with our call volume.

Jean-Luc:  I completely agree.  I don’t think that the call center needs to be micro-managed, but it does take more oversight than IT or accounting for quality control, especially if we decide to go offshore.

Bonnie:  Okay, I think we’re thinking along the same lines.  Let’s call a meeting with the rest of the staff to get their thoughts.  How about next Tuesday at 10 a.m.?

 Jean-Luc:  That works for me.  I’ll send out an email out to everybody today.

[End of story]

The title of this podcast is, “Outsourcing Operations.”  To outsource, “outsource,” one word, means to get another company to do part of your work.  So, if your company or organization does many different things, it may hire, “hire,” or pay another company to do part of your work.  Operations just refers to the different things that a company does.

Our dialogue is between Bonnie and Jean-Luc, and they’re in a meeting - always an exciting thing.  Bonnie says to Jean-Luc, “I wanted us to meet today to talk about ways,” or methods, “to reduce our overhead.”  To reduce means to make less or to lower.  Overhead, “overhead,” is the money that a company pays for its rent, for its insurance, for all the things that it needs to keep the company going.

Overhead is sometimes called fixed costs.  Fixed, “fixed,” costs, “costs,” are costs, or expenses - money you have to pay - that do not depend on how much your company produces.  For example, if you are a manufacturer, a maker of chairs, you need to buy materials, to buy things to make each chair.  But, there are some expenses, some things you have to pay for - the rent, the lights - that do not depend on how many chairs you sell, and these fixed costs are your overhead.  It's what the company pays, no matter how much it sells of a certain thing or makes of a certain thing.  The word overhead actually has a couple of different meanings.  Take a look at the Learning Guide today to find out what else overhead means in English.

Bonnie says, “One suggestion is for us to outsource some of our operations.” We know what outsourcing means.  It means getting another company to do some of your work - paying another company, or another person, to do part of the work of your company.  This has become very popular in many companies in the United States.  Take a look at our Learning Guide where we talk about this more in detail.

Bonnie says, “I’d like to hear what you think,” Jean-Luc, “are the pros and cons of doing that.”  The pros, “pros,” and the cons, “cons,” refer to the good things and the bad things.  The pros are the good possibilities, what we may call the advantages, and the cons are the bad things, or the disadvantages.  We also use the expression, “the pluses and the minuses.”  A plus is something that is good

 that adds something, and a minus is something that takes something away, or is a negative thing.

Jean-Luc says, “I think that, in principle, it’s a good idea.”  The expression here, in principle, “principle,” means that Jean-Luc likes the idea in general, but not necessarily for this specific case, for this specific situation.  So, when someone says, “Well, that's good in principle,” they mean, well, in a general way, maybe for some other situation, but not necessarily for this particular situation.  We might also say, theoretically.  In principle or theoretically, it's a good idea.

Jean-Luc says, “It would save us a lot of money, but I see a downside.”  A downside, “downside,” all one word, is a negative result, a bad thing that could happen if you do this thing.  For example, if you walk up to a beautiful woman and you say, “Hey baby, do you want to dance with me,” the downside is that she will say, “No!  Get away, I don't want to dance with you!”  That's the downside. The upside, which is the opposite, “upside,” is that she'll say, “Oh, yes Jeff, I would love to dance with you!”  So you see, every situation has an upside and a downside.  I usually see the downside.

Jean-Luc says, “We could lose,” or “We would lose control of some of our key in house operations.”  In house, “house” - like the house you live in - in house operations are things that a company does by itself, that it doesn't give to other companies to do.

Bonnie says, “Well, I think we want to focus on non-core operations.”  Non-core, “non-core,” are things a company does that are not the most important, they're less important things.  The opposite of non-core would be core operations, and these are the most important things that your company does.  Bonnie says that she thinks they should “focus on non-core operations such as IT.”  IT means information technology - those are the computer people, some of you listening today are IT people, “or accounting.”  Accounting, “accounting,” is the part of the company that pays the bills and collects, or gets, the money.  So, that's the part of the company that takes care of the money and often the taxes that a company pays.

Bonnie says that she knows that some “other companies have outsourced their call centers.”  A call, “call,” center is a place where you have people who answer telephones.  For example, when you have a problem with something, you may call the company to complain - to say, “I have problem” - and you will talk to

 someone in a call center.  It's a building, it's a place where you have usually several people answering the telephone.  Bonnie says that having an outsourced call center would require, “would take a lot of training, especially with our call volume.”  The expression here, call volume, “volume,” doesn't mean how loud something is, it means how much there is.  So, the volume is the number of telephone calls, in this case.

Jean-Luc says, “I agree,” he doesn't “think that the call center needs to be micro- managed.”  To micro, “micro,” -manage, “manage” something means to try to control every little thing.  To micro-manage is when a boss tries to tell the employee everything they need to do too much.  Usually micro-manage is used as a negative expression, not always.  But, to micro-manage means that you have to manage, you have to supervise someone for everything that is required for the job.

Jean-Luc says that the call center does require “more oversight.”  Oversight, “oversight,” is the same as supervision - to be watching something.  It requires “more oversight...for quality control.”  The expression quality, “quality,” control, “control,” means that you are making sure that it is good.  Quality control is what a company does to make sure that the things it is making are of a good, or a high, quality.

Jean-Luc says that this is a special problem if they “decide to go offshore.” Offshore, “offshore,” all one word, means to go to a company in a different country, or to go overseas, “overseas,” to go to a different company in another country.

Bonnie says, “Okay, I think we’re thinking along the same lines.”  To think along the same lines, “lines,” means to be thinking the same, we have the same idea. She suggests that they meet “with the rest of the staff to get their” ideas.  The staff, “staff,” are the other workers, the other employees.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Bonnie:  I wanted us to meet today to talk about ways to reduce our overhead. One suggestion is for us to outsource some of our operations.  I’d like to hear what you think are the pros and cons of doing that.

# Lost and Found

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 217, “Lost and Found.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 217.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com to get more information about our podcast and some new things we have on our website.  You'll also find a copy of the Learning Guide for this episode, which has all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions that we do not talk about in the podcast, cultural notes and a complete transcript of this episode.

Our episode 217 is called, “Lost and Found.”  Let's go!

[Start of story]

Airport employee:  Hello, Portland Airport, Lost and Found.

Lucas:  Hello.  I was a passenger on a SunCal Airlines flight yesterday and I think I left my keys on the plane.

Airport employee:  I see.  To claim the item, you have to fill out a claim form. What did you lose again?  Some luggage?  You’ll need your claim receipt to get your luggage.

Lucas:  No, I lost some keys on the airplane.  Keys.  I think I left them on my seat.  Is it possible to find out if anyone has turned them in to your office?

Airport employee:  I don’t know.  Can you describe them?

Lucas:  Well, they’re on a key chain and there are eight keys on it, including a car key.

Airport employee:  Was there anything distinctive about the key chain?  You’ll need to prove ownership if you want to claim them.

 Lucas:  No, it’s a plain key ring.  Maybe I should come down to the office to see if I can identify them.  What happens to property that’s unclaimed?

Airport employee:  We keep it for 30 days and then we dispose of it.  Don’t worry. We don’t have a policy of finders, keepers.  If you lost some luggage, it’ll turn up.

Lucas:  No, I lost some keys!  Keys!  Never mind.  I’m coming down right now.

Airport employee:  That’s a good idea.  It’s easier to pick up your lost luggage than for us to send it.

Lucas:  Uh!

[End of story]

The title of this podcast is, “Lost and Found.”  Lost and found is a place in a store or an airport, or some public place where you can go to if you lose something and someone brings it to the lost and found, someone finds it for you.  This is the place where you go to see if anyone has found it and brought it back.  So, it's a place in a store, or an airport, or a bus station.  Sometimes it's not a separate place.  Sometimes it is part of another office or another area in an airport, or in a train station, or in a store.  There are also online lost and found places now.  If you look at our Cultural Note in the Learning Guide today, you'll get more information about that.

Our dialogue begins with the employee, the person who works at the airport, answering the telephone.  So, this is a telephone conversation, and she says “Hello, Portland Airport, Lost and Found.”  So, she is identifying, she is saying where she is, who you are calling, which is a common thing that businesses do.

Our gentleman in this dialogue, Lucas, says “Hello.  I was a passenger on a flight yesterday and I think I left my keys on the plane.”  Lucas says, I was on one of your airplanes yesterday - I was on a flight yesterday and I think I left my keys - your car keys, your house keys, that sort of thing.  A key is something you use to open something that is locked.

Well, the airport employee doesn't seem to really listen very well.  She says, “I see” - I understand.  “To claim the item, you have to fill out a claim form.”  To claim, “claim,” means to get something back, or to say that something is yours.  It

 belongs to you.  So, the airport employees says, well, if you want to get it back, if you want to claim the item, the thing that you lost, you'll “have to fill out a claim form.”  And a claim form is a piece of paper that you put your name and address and information on, and that way the airport or the store has some record of what happened to this lost item.

The airport employee says, “What did you lose again?  Some luggage?” Luggage, “luggage,” is the same as baggage, “baggage.”  For traveling in an airplane, that's usually your suitcases, the thing you use to put your clothes and other items into to carry them.  The airport employee says you’ll need to have a “claim receipt to get your luggage.”  A claim receipt is a piece of paper they give you at the airport when you give them your baggage, you give them your luggage.  We say when you “check your luggage.”  To check your luggage at the airport means to give your suitcase and they put it in the bottom of the plane and then you pick it up again when you arrive at the place where you are going to. So, this is a claim receipt, it's a little piece of paper that has a number on it, usually, and there's also a little piece of paper on your luggage.

Lucas says, “No, I lost some keys on the airplane.”  He's trying to explain to the airport employee that he did not lose his luggage.  He says, “I think I left” my keys “on my seat” - where I was sitting.  “Is it possible to find out if anyone has turned them in to your office?”  To turn (something) in means that you find something that isn't yours and you give it to the store, or the airport, or wherever you are.  So for example, if you are at the train station and you find a wallet with money and driver’s license and other information, credit cards, you would, I hope, take that to the lost and found and say, “Here, I found this.”  You would turn it in. You would give it back so someone could come back and claim it.

The airport employee says, “I don’t know.  Can you describe” your keys?  He says, “Well,” the keys are “on a key chain and there are eight keys on it.”  A key chain, “chain,” is usually a round piece of metal that holds your keys.  My key chain is huge because I have keys for everything.  Well, Lucas says that he has eight keys on his key chain, and the airport employee asks him is “there anything distinctive about the key chain?”  Distinctive, “distinctive,” means is there anything special, is there anything different about your key chain?  She says that Lucas will “need to prove ownership if” he wants “to claim them.”  To prove, “prove,” means to show or to demonstrate.  Ownership is the idea that you own something, you possess something, that it's yours.  So, you need to prove that it is yours, she says.

 Lucas says, “it’s a plain key ring.”  The adjective plain, “plain” - different spelling from the thing that you fly in, which is a plane, “plane” - a plain key chain, or a plain key ring, is a normal...not special.  We say something is plain we mean there's nothing special, nothing different, nothing extraordinary about it, nothing unusual about it.

Lucas says he can come “to the office” and “identify them,” or say that, “Yes, those are mine.”  That is to identify.  He asks what happens to things that are unclaimed, meaning no one comes and gets them.  The employee's says that they keep things “for thirty days and then” they “dispose of it.”  To dispose, “dispose,” means to get rid of, to either throw out or to give away to someone else.  The employee says that they “don’t have a policy of finders, keepers.”  The expression finders, “finders,” keepers, “keepers,” means that if you find something, it belongs to you.  This is an expression that kids use sometimes, children.  Finders, keepers means if I find it, I get to keep it.  The full expression is, “Finders, keepers, losers, weepers,” meaning if I find it, I get to keep it, and if it is yours, you lose it and therefore you will cry, you will weep.  To weep, “weep,” means to cry.  So, “Finders, keepers, losers, weepers.”

The employee says, “If you lost some luggage, it will turn up.”  To turn up, “turn up,” two words, means that someone will find it.  It will be found.  The expression, “turn up” and “turn in” have different meanings, other meanings besides the ones we have described here.  If you look at the Learning Guide today, you will see some additional definitions for those two terms.

Lucas is getting somewhat angry.  He says, “No, I lost some keys!  Never mind,” he says to the employee.  The expression never mind, “mind,” means forget about it.  Don't worry about it.  Sometimes you say that to someone who is not very smart, doesn't understand you.  You try to explain, and then you'll say, “Never mind.”  This happens with me and my wife all the time.  She tries to explain something to me, I'm too stupid and she says, “Never mind.”

Finally, the airport employee, who still does not understand, says oh, I'm sure that it would be easier for you to get your luggage than for them to send it, and Lucas just says, “Uh!”  He's completely frustrated.  He's tired of talking to this employee.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

 [Start of story]

Airport employee:  Hello, Portland Airport, Lost and Found.

Lucas:  Hello.  I was a passenger on a SunCal Airlines flight yesterday and I think I left my keys on the plane.

Airport employee:  I see.  To claim the item, you have to fill out a claim form. What did you lose again?  Some luggage?  You’ll need your claim receipt to get your luggage.

Lucas:  No, I lost some keys on the airplane.  Keys.  I think I left them on my seat.  Is it possible to find out if anyone has turned them in to your office?

Airport employee:  I don’t know.  Can you describe them?

Lucas:  Well, they’re on a key chain and there are eight keys on it, including a car key.

Airport employee:  Was there anything distinctive about the key chain?  You’ll need to prove ownership if you want to claim them.

Lucas:  No, it’s a plain key ring.  Maybe I should come down to the office to see if I can identify them.  What happens to property that’s unclaimed?

Airport employee:  We keep it for 30 days and then we dispose of it.  Don’t worry. We don’t have a policy of finders, keepers.  If you lost some luggage, it’ll turn up.

Lucas:  No, I lost some keys!  Keys!  Never mind.  I’m coming down right now.

Airport employee:  That’s a good idea.  It’s easier to pick up your lost luggage than for us to send it.

Lucas:  Uh!

# Getting a Driver's License

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 218, “Getting a Driver's License.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 218.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  There you will find a list of all the words that we will be using in this podcast, their definitions, a(n) additional culture note as well as a complete transcript of this episode.  All that is in our Learning Guide, which you can find on our website.

Our dialogue in this podcast is about someone who wants to get a license to drive.  Let's go.

[Start of story]

Jane:  Hey, Henry.  You look busy.  What's that you're reading?

Henry:  Oh, hi, Jane.  I'm studying the driver's manual so I can finally get my driver's license.  I just hope I can remember all these traffic laws.

Jane:  I’m sure you’ll pass the tests with flying colors, especially since you can miss a few and still pass.  Just don't forget to bring your glasses with you so you don’t fail the vision test.

Henry:  Yeah, I know.  I think the written test will be okay, but I’m really worried about the road test.  I never took driver’s ed and I’m nervous behind the wheel. My brother failed his test the first time because he forgot to signal a left turn, and then he didn't yield to a pedestrian.  He also screwed up on the parallel parking.

Jane:  It sounds like he just got nervous.  A busy intersection is always tricky.  So when's your appointment at the DMV?

Henry:  Next Tuesday.  But I might just go in earlier and take the test as a walk- in.

 Jane:  Can't wait, huh?  Well, I'll let you get back to studying.  Good luck!

Henry:  Thanks.  See you around.

[End of story]

Our podcast is called, “Getting a Driver's License.”  A driver's license is permission from the state government were you live to drive.  Every state has its own driver's license.  We do not have a national driver's license in the United States.  So, if you live in California, you have to get a California driver's license. If you move to a different state, you would have to get a different driver's license. Sometimes you have to take another test when you move to a different state, but not always.

In our dialogue, we have Jane and Henry, and Jane asks Henry what he is reading.  She says, “Hey, Henry.  You look busy.  What's that you're reading,” meaning what are you reading?  What is the thing, the book that you are reading?  And Henry says he's “studying the driver's manual.”  A manual, “manual,” is a book that gives you instructions that tells you how to do something, how to perform something.  You can have a manual for fixing your car.  There are manuals for fixing your relationships.  I need to get one of those!  And, there are manuals that tell you how to drive.  The driver's manual is actually a list of the laws of a state that are concerned with driving, laws, rules that you have to know. Most of the rules are the same across the 50 states of the United States, but sometimes there are differences.

Henry's studying the driver's manual because he wants to get his license.  Most Americans get their driver’s license either when they're 16, 17 or 18 years old. Sometimes there are people, who live in big cities like New York where they don't need a driver’s license; they don't need a car because they have good public transportation.  But it's very common for high school students to take a special class to learn how to drive, and that class is called driver's ed.  Driver's ed, “ed,” is short here for education.

Henry says that he has to study all of the traffic laws.  The traffic, “traffic,” laws are the rules about how you should drive.  If you don't follow the rules, you can get what we call a ticket, and you can learn more about what a ticket is and what it means in the United States by looking at the Culture Note in today's Learning Guide.

 Jane then says to Henry “I’m sure you’ll pass the tests with flying colors.”  The expression with flying, “flying,” colors means that you will be very successful. You will have a very good score.  Usually the idea here is that you will do it easily, with flying colors - to do very well.  “Especially, “ Jane says, “since you can miss a few and still pass.”  You can miss, “miss,” a few and still pass.  What she means is that you can get some of the questions wrong, a few of the questions, and still pass the exam, still get your license.  That word miss, “miss,” has several different meanings in English, and we talk about the other meanings of that word in our Learning Guide today.

Jane says, “Just don't forget to bring your glasses with you so you don’t fail the vision test.”  To fail a test is the opposite of to pass a test.  You do not get your license if you fail the driver's test.  You will also not get a license if you fail the vision test.  Vision, “vision,” test is a test that you have to take to see that you can see correctly, that you have good, what we would call good vision.  You're able to see the other cars.  You're able to see the stop sign.  This is a test that every state, I think, gives you, and it's just an eye test to see if you can see.  If you need glasses in order to pass the test, they put that on your license.  Your license says that you must drive with your glasses or some contacts.  Contacts are the little pieces of plastic, what we would call lenses, “lenses,” that work like glasses, so that they're on top of your eye.  “Contacts,” contacts.  So, you have to pass the vision test.

Well, Henry says, “I think the written test will be okay.”  There are two tests that you have to take; one is a written test.  The other is a road test, and this is what Henry is worried about.  He's concerned about the road test.  And, the road test means that you have to get into the car with the examiner, that's the person who is giving you the exam, and demonstrate, show that you can drive correctly. Henry says he “never took driver’s ed,” which we know is driver's education, and he's “nervous behind the wheel.”  The expression to be behind the wheel means that you are driving the car.  The thing that you turn the car with, right and left and to go straight, that you control the car with is called the wheel.  We actually call it the steering wheel.  To steer, “steer,” means to direct or control a car or a boat

“My brother,” Henry says, “failed his test the first time because he forgot to signal a left turn.”  To signal, “signal,” means to indicate, and you do that in a car by turning on the blinker, “blinker.”  The blinker is the light that shows people you are going left or going right.  There is a law that you are supposed to signal your

 turn, meaning if you are going to turn left or turn right, you have to put your blinkers on that indicate that to the other drivers behind you.

Well, Henry's brother was not a very good driver, it seems.  He also failed to “yield to a pedestrian,” and “screwed up on parallel parking.”  To yield, “yield,” means to let someone go in front of you, to let someone else go first.  The word actually has several different meanings both as a noun and as a verb, and we talk about those in our Learning Guide today.  So, to yield to a pedestrian is to stop and let a person who is crossing the street go first.  A pedestrian, “pedestrian,” is a person who is walking, not driving - so a person who is walking on the road or walking down the street.

Henry's brother also “screwed up on parallel parking.  To screw, “screw,” up, “up,” two words, means to make a mistake, to do it wrong.  Very important, the word “up” here.  To screw up means to get something wrong.  Parallel parking is when you have to park the car in between two other cars, and that, of course, can be somewhat difficult.  That is part of most driving tests.  You have to parallel park, to park the car in between two other cars.

Jane then says that Henry's brother probably “just got nervous.  A busy intersection is always tricky,” she says.  An intersection, “intersection,” is where two streets cross each other.  The intersections can be tricky, Jane says, and then she asks Henry when his “appointment at the DMV” is.  An appointment is like a meeting or a date.  It's a time that you have to go somewhere to do something.  DMV stands for Department of Motors Vehicles.  The DMV is the government office in a state that gives the driver's license, that is responsible for giving people driver’s licenses.  Some states call it something different.  Here in California it's called the DMV, the Department of Motors Vehicles.

Henry says it's “Next Tuesday,” his appointment, but he might “take the test as a walk-in.”  When we say you're going take the test as a walk-in, “walk-in,” we mean that you will not have an appointment, that you will just go and wait in line to take your test.  And, if you go to the DMV in California, you will wait a very long time because there are many people who try to take their test every day.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

 Jane:  Hey, Henry.  You look busy.  What's that you're reading?

Henry:  Oh, hi, Jane.  I'm studying the driver's manual so I can finally get my driver's license.  I just hope I can remember all these traffic laws.

Jane:  I’m sure you’ll pass the tests with flying colors, especially since you can miss a few and still pass.  Just don't forget to bring your glasses with you so you don’t fail the vision test.

# Giving Compliments

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 219, “Giving Compliments.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 219.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

If you visit our website at eslpod.com, you can pick up the Learning Guide for this episode, which has all of the vocabulary, definitions, additional definitions we don't talk about on the podcast, cultural notes and a complete transcript of everything we say.

This podcast is called, “Giving Compliments,” or saying something nice to someone.  Let's go!

[Start of story]

A friend from work, Nia, asked a few of us over to her apartment to watch the game this Sunday and I was really nervous.  I’ve always liked Nia and I was hoping we could be more than friends.  My brother, Charlie, said that if I really liked her, I should be sure to give her plenty of compliments when I saw her.

I arrived on Sunday and knocked on her door.

Nia:  Hi, I’m glad you could make it.  You’re the first one here.  Make yourself comfortable.

Sebastian:  Thanks and you look great.  Red looks great on you.

Nia:  Oh, thanks.  It’s nice to be out of work clothes.  Can I get you something to drink?

Sebastian:  Sure.  What are you having?

Nia:  I’m just having a beer.  Want one?

Sebastian:  Sure.  What a cool place!  This is a really nice apartment.

 Nia:  Here you go.  Actually, I just moved in last month and I’m still decorating. But, that’s nice of you to say.

Sebastian:  Wow, nice picture.  Did you paint this?

Nia:  No, I didn’t.  Someone named Picasso did.  It’s just a copy.  You know, I really appreciate the compliments, but what’s up?

Sebastian:  Up?  Nothing.  I’m just glad to be here.

Nia:  Well, I’m glad you’re here, too.  Now, drink up.  The others should be here any minute.

Sebastian:  Sure.  Cheers!

[End of story]

Our podcast episode is called, “Giving Compliments,” and a compliment is something nice you say to someone.  It's spelled “compliment,” very important that you spell this word with an “i” in the middle.  There's another word that sounds the same, complement, spelled with an “e.”  That word means something that completes or finishes something else.  You could say, for example that the song’s words - the words of the song, the lyrics - complement the music well. They complete it.  It's a good match.  In our story, we're talking about compliments with an “i,” and those are nice things you say to someone.  We usually use the verb to give a compliment, means to say something nice.  And, the compliments are not necessarily for someone you are romantically interested in, like Sebastian in our story, you can also compliment your boss or your friend or the host of ESL Podcast, for example.

Well, our story begins by Sebastian saying that, “A friend from” his “work, Nia, asked a few of” his friends “over to her apartment.”  To ask someone over means to invite them to come to your house or to your apartment.  So, I could ask you over to my house means I'm inviting you to come over to my house.  Now, if you are in a car and you are with someone outside of their house, then you would say, “May I invite you in?” meaning would you like to come into the house.  If you live in an apartment building, you might say, “Can I invite you up?” meaning do you want to go up to my apartment.  But here, we're talking about just inviting

 someone in advance, someone for tomorrow or next week or next month, then you would ask them over.

Nia has invited Sebastian and a few others “to watch the game this Sunday.” Now normally, if you say you're going to watch the game, you usually mean the American football game that's on, especially if it's during the football season, from August to, I think, February or March.  Sebastian says that he's nervous because he likes Nia, and he hopes that they can become “more than friends.” When someone says, “I want to be more than friends,” they mean I want to be romantically connected to you, and this is what Sebastian, like so many people, want.  He mentions that his brother, Charlie, told him that he should give Nia lots of compliments when he saw her.

He goes to her apartment on Sunday, and she answers the door.  To answer the door means to open the door for someone who is knocking on it.  And, she says, “Hi, I’m glad you could make it.”  To make it here means to be here, to come here.  So, she's saying I'm glad you are here; I'm glad you could come today. “You’re the first one here.  Make yourself comfortable.”  Make yourself comfortable means come in, sit down, relax.  You may also say, “Make yourself at home,” it means the same thing.

Sebastian says, “Thanks and you look great.”  You see?  He's already saying nice things to her.  Then he says, “Red looks great on you.”  He is complimenting - and that's a verb as well as a noun, compliment - he is complimenting Nia on her shirt, or perhaps her dress.  He says, “Red looks great on you.”  You say if someone has a nice piece of clothing that it looks good on them or it looks great on them.  Nia says thank you and asks Sebastian if he wants “something to drink.”  He says, “Sure,” I'll have what you're having.  What are you drinking?  Nia says that she's going to have a beer and asks Sebastian if he wants one.  She says, “Want one?” meaning, do you want one?  Sebastian says, “Sure,” and then he gives her another compliment.

He says, “What a cool place.”  Cool, “cool,” means nice or great.  The expression, what a, is something we use when we want to say something usually very positive about someone or something.  If someone says, “What a movie!” you mean isn't that a great movie or that was a fantastic movie.  Well he is complimenting her apartment by saying, “What a cool place!  This is a really nice apartment.”  Again, “This is a really nice apartment” is another type of compliment.

 Nia says that she “just moved in last month and” she's “still decorating.”  To decorate, “decorate,” is a verb that means to try to make your house or your apartment look better by painting the walls, by getting nice pictures, maybe by putting carpet on the floor - this would be a way of decorating.  She says, “that’s nice of you to say,” so she's accepting the compliment, and that's a nice way, a good way to accept or thank someone for a compliment.  “Oh, that's nice of you to say.”  Then Sebastian asks who painted the nice picture that she has. Somewhat stupidly, he asks if Nia painted it and Nia says, “No.  Someone named Picasso did.”  Of course, Sebastian is trying to compliment Nia too much, thinks that she painted a Picasso picture.  Nia says that has a copy of this picture, that's what they're looking at.

And then she says, “You know, I really appreciate the compliments, but what’s up?”  Notice the use there of “you know,” that is a way of getting someone's attention, in this case.  It would be the same as saying listen.  We also use that expression, you know, in other instances.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for today for additional information about how we use that very common expression. So, NIa is asking Sebastian “what's up?” meaning what is he trying to do, and Sebastian says, “Up?  Nothing,” meaning I'm not trying to do anything special here.

Nia says, “Well, I’m glad you’re here.  Now, drink up.”  Drink up means finish whatever you are drinking.  It's one of those two word verbs, those phrasal verbs in English.  To drink up means to finish what you are drinking.  “The others,” Nia says, “should be here any minute,” meaning they'll be here very soon.  If you say, “I'm going to be there any minute,” you mean I'm going to be there very soon.

Sebastian says to Nia, “Cheers!”  Cheers, “cheers,” is what you say when you are drinking something, usually alcohol.  Most cultures have a word or an expression that you are wishing good health or are celebrating something you would raise up your glass, lift up your glass and say, “Cheers!”  There was actually a very popular television program in the United States many years ago called “Cheers” about a bar in, I think, Boston, Massachusetts.  That was called “Cheers.”

You notice that Sebastian tries to give lots of compliments to Nia, in our Learning Guide today, we have a very interesting section about what kind of compliments you can give to a man or woman that you are interested in.  So, if you want some help with that, look at the Learning Guide.

 Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

A friend from work, Nia, asked a few of us over to her apartment to watch the game this Sunday and I was really nervous.  I’ve always liked Nia and I was hoping we could be more than friends.

# Giving Opinions in a Meeting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 220, “Giving Opinions in a Meeting.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 220.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  There you can find a transcript of the dialogue part of this podcast for free.  If you want to get all of the vocabulary words, the definitions, additional cultural notes and explanations, as well as the complete transcript of this podcast, you can become an ESL Podcast member. More information is on our website.

Today's podcast is called “Giving Opinions in a Meeting.”  Let's go.

[Start of story]

I was in a department meeting and our manager was asking for our feedback on improving our product.  I had a few ideas and I wanted to get them across, but one of my colleagues was giving me a hard time.

Marcelo:  In my opinion, I think that we need to look at the question more from the customer’s perspective.  I really feel we need to do more market research.

Ellen:  I tend to think that we have enough information already and it’s time to make some decisions.

Marcelo:  Well, the way I see it, we’ve only scratched the surface in getting to know our customers.  We need to get inside their heads if we want to offer what they want and aren’t getting right now.

Ellen:  You may be right, but if you ask me, I just don’t think it’s worth it to sink more time and money into the type of market research you’re proposing.  It’s far more than what other companies are doing.

Marcelo:  That’s precisely my point.  I’m sure that if we can get information that other companies don’t have, we’ll be one step ahead.

 That’s when the manager stepped in and offered her opinion.  And, I’m happy to say, she sided with me.

[End of story]

The dialogue we just heard is about two people giving their ideas - giving their opinions or telling other people what they think in a meeting.  It included several common expressions that we often use in giving our opinion.

The story begins with Marcelo saying that he has a meeting today; the manager has asked for their feedback on improving their product.  Feedback, “feedback,” is your opinion or your reaction.  So, he's asking for their opinion; he's asking for their reaction - their feedback on improving what the company makes - their product.

The speaker here, Marcelo, says that he has some ideas and he wants “to get them across.”  “To get an idea across,” means to communicate, to express your ideas, to tell someone what you are thinking.  That is a common expression, “I'm trying to get my point across.”  “I'm trying to get my idea across,” means I'm attempting to communicate my ideas.

The problem Marcelo is having is that one of the people that he works with, one of his colleagues, was giving him a hard time.  A colleague, “colleague,” is a person that you work with, not necessarily someone who is your boss, not someone above you but someone at the same level - the same type of work or the same type of job that you have.  These would be your colleagues.  So, when I worked at the University, my colleagues were other professors.  The adjective is collegial.  When we say something is or someone is collegial we mean that they get along, they are nice to the people they work with.  The colleagues of Marcelo are not so nice; they've been giving him a hard time.  To give someone a hard time means to make things difficult for them.

Then we go into the meeting.  Marcelo says, “In my opinion, I think we need to take a look at the question more from the customer’s perspective.”  The expression, “in my opinion,” is a way that you can start a sentence when you are going to give your idea.  Notice also that Marcelo talks about “the customer's perspective.”  Perspective, “perspective,” means the point of view - the way that someone else sees things - the way they interpret things.  That would be the customer's perspective, or the customer's view.

 “I really feel,” Marcelo says, “we need to do more market research.”  We sometimes use the verb “to feel” to express our opinion - to say what we think. So, when someone says, “I feel that we need to do something,” they're saying, “I think that we need to do something.”

Ellen is Marcelo's colleague, and she doesn't agree with Marcelo.  She says, “I tend to think that we have enough information already.”  I tend, “tend,” to think. “To tend to think” means that this is the way I think, usually, or in a situation like this, “this is my opinion.”  “I tend to think” is a somewhat more polite way of communicating your ideas.  You are saying to the other person that this is my way of thinking; it may not necessarily be the only way of thinking.  So, Ellen is trying to be nice here, and say, “I tend to think that we have enough information,” she's disagreeing with Marcelo.  For additional explanations and additional meanings of this verb, to tend, see today's Learning Guide.

Marcelo continues to express his ideas, he says “Well, the way I see it, we’ve only scratched the surface in getting to know our customers.”  “The way I see it” is another way of saying this is my opinion.  It might be a way of expressing your opinion a little less politely.  When you are starting to get into a disagreement with someone and you want to be a little stronger in how you give your opinion, you might use this expression.

“Well, the way I see it” - my perspective - my opinion is that “we've only scratched the surface.”  To scratch, “scratch,” the surface, “surface,” means that we have only just begun to do something, that there is a lot more information or a lot more work that we have to do.  What we have done so far is just preliminary - it's just the beginning.  To scratch means normally to, for example, take your hand, and you have a funny feeling on your skin - it bothers you - so you take your hand - your fingers - your fingernails and you scratch.  A cat uses his paws - his feet - to scratch the chair.  That is the verb “to scratch.”  The surface is just the top of something.

Well, Marcelo goes on to say that, “We need to get inside our customers' heads.” To get inside someone's head, which sounds very painful, actually means to understand someone's thinking - to understand their perspective - the way they look at the world.  If you wanted to understand the way I think, you would need to get inside my head.  I don't recommend that, however.  There's nothing up there - nothing in my head!

 Ellen says to Marcelo, “You may be right, but if you ask me, I don’t think it is worth sinking more time and money into this market research.”  “If you ask me” is another way of expressing your opinion.  You are saying, “well, maybe you are not asking me - my opinion may not be important to you, but I am going to give it to you anyway, even if you don't want to hear it.”

So, Ellen says, “if you ask me, I just don’t think it’s worth it to sink more money and time.”  Sink, “sink,” as a verb means to spend.  So, “I don't think we should spend more time and money on this type of research.”  Usually, we use that verb when you are spending money for the wrong thing - you are wasting money or that you have spent too much money already.  Ellen goes on to say that it's “more than what other companies are doing.”

Marcelo then responds, “That’s precisely my point.”  That's precisely, or exactly my idea; you are agreeing with me.  That is the expression we would use when you are having a discussion and someone else says something that you think communicates the same idea, and maybe they don't realize it so you say, “that's exactly my point - that's my idea.” The word “point” has many different meanings in English.  We talk about those additional meanings in the Learning Guide for this episode.

Marcelo says, “I’m sure that if we can get information other companies don’t have, we will be one step ahead.”  “I'm sure that” is a way of expressing your opinion that you are very confident in - that you know is correct.  “I’m sure that if we can get information, we'll be one step ahead,” meaning we will be more advanced or we will be in front of the other companies.  A step, “step,” one meaning of that word is the distance that you take with your feet when you walk. So, if you move for your feet ten times that would be ten steps.  Marcelo is saying.  “we can be one step ahead.”

“The manager then stepped in,” or stopped the meeting, or stopped the discussion, “and offered her opinion.  And,” Marcelo says, “she sided with” him. To side, “side,” with someone, as a verb, means to agree with someone. Usually, when two people are having an argument - a discussion - you are the third person, you can side with one of them - you can agree with one of them against the other one.  Sometimes these disagreements or problems can get more serious, and so many American companies have a policy - have rules for what are called “grievances.”  And, to find out more about that take a look at today's Learning Guide.

 Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

I was in a department meeting and our manager was asking for our feedback on improving our product.  I had a few ideas and I wanted to get them across, but one of my colleagues was giving me a hard time.

Marcelo:  In my opinion, I think that we need to look at the question more from the customer’s perspective.  I really feel we need to do more market research.

Ellen:  I tend to think that we have enough information already and it’s time to make some decisions.

Marcelo:  Well, the way I see it, we’ve only scratched the surface in getting to know our customers.  We need to get inside their heads if we want to offer what they want and aren’t getting right now.

Ellen:  You may be right, but if you ask me, I just don’t think it’s worth it to sink more time and money into the type of market research you’re proposing.  It’s far more than what other companies are doing.

Marcelo:  That’s precisely my point.  I’m sure that if we can get information that other companies don’t have, we’ll be one step ahead.

That’s when the manager stepped in and offered her opinion.  And, I’m happy to say, she sided with me.

[Start of story]  I met Diana last year when we were both working in New York City for the summer.  I’m finishing college in California and Diana started her first job in Florida.  Talk about a bicoastal relationship!  We spent three great months together and we’ve been trying to maintain a long distance relationship ever since.  It’s been really hard and I had a talk about it with my friend, Emily, who just got out of a relationship like this.  Enrique:  I’m always worried that for her, it’s out of sight, out of mind.  Emily:  I know what you mean, but is it that way with you?  Enrique:  No, not at all.  I think about her all the time.  It’s not that there aren’t temptations, but I’m committed to Diana.    Emily:  Don’t you get the same vibe from her?  Enrique:  Sometimes I do, but a lot of times I don’t.  It’s so easy to get into a fight on the phone.  We have misunderstandings all the time or I hurt her feelings without realizing it.  And plus, I’m still in school and she’s already out working, and it seems like we’re growing apart. # Alternative Medicine

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 222: Alternative Medicine.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 222.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  You'll find there the Learning Guide for this episode, which contains all of the vocabulary, additional sample sentences using the words we're going to talk about today.  It also contains a complete transcript of this entire episode along with additional explanations and culture notes.

Our topic in this episode is alternative medicine.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I have been suffering from back pain for years.  I’ve tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor, but nothing has had a lasting effect.  I finally decided to try alternative medicine.

My friend, Amelia, swore by acupuncture.  She said that her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy.  She was skeptical when she first started, but she knew after only a few sessions that it was working for her and that this was no New Age nonsense.  She thought it might work for me, too.

My co-worker, Ray, suggested that I try some homeopathic treatments.  He said that taking herbal supplements that are all natural has helped him recover after getting injured on the job a couple of months ago.  He took these as complementary to the traditional medication his doctor gave him.  He said that even though the herbs he takes haven’t undergone clinical trials, his own experience told him that they work.

I’m a little nervous about trying these unorthodox treatments, but after hearing about Amelia’s and Ray’s experiences, I’m willing to give them a try.  Nothing has worked so far, so what do I have to lose?

[End of story]

 This episode is called “Alternative Medicine.”

The word alternative means different or choosing a different kind of something. Someone may say, “What are my alternatives,” meaning what are my choices. Here, alternate medicine means a different kind of medicine.  It might also be called nontraditional medicine.

The story begins by me saying that I have suffered “from back pain for years. I’ve tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor.”  To prescribe, “prescribe,” is to give a patient - a doctor giving a patient some medicine to take.  You are prescribed, by your doctor, certain medicines.  These are things that the doctor says you should do.  Normally, when we say something is prescribed, or that it is a prescription drug, we mean that you can only get those drugs or those types of medicine from a doctor - from a medical doctor, not from an applied linguistics doctor.  I can't give you any drugs.  I can give you something better than drugs: ESLPodcast!

The story continues that although I've tried these different medicines, “nothing has had a lasting effect.”  Lasting, “lasting,” means permanent or continuing for a long time.  We sometimes say, “long-lasting,” which means the same - something that will be continuing for a long period of time.  The word lasting has another meaning, and we talk about the other meanings of that word in our Learning Guide for this episode.

The story continues by saying that “I finally decided to try alternative medicine. My friend, Amelia, swore by acupuncture.”  To swear, “swear,” by something means to trust in something - to believe in something or to rely on something.  “I swear by these pills” - “I swear by this drug.”  What I'm saying is I believe in it - I think it is good - I think it is useful.

To swear can also mean to say some vulgar words.  I won't do any here on the episode, but that's one meaning of swear.  To swear also means to say that you believe in something or to say that something is true, and that's the meaning that we're using here.

“My friend, Amelia, swore by” - swore is the past tense of swear, “swore” - she “swore by acupuncture.”  Acupuncture, “acupuncture,” is when the person, who we would call an acupuncturist, uses little pins - little needles - and sticks them in your body.  This is a nontraditional kind of medicine.  I have never had acupuncture; I don't like needles.

 The story says that my friend Amelia told me that “her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy.”  Therapy, “therapy,” is a set of things or a kind of treatment that you have to reduce your pain or to make you feel better.  You can have therapy that is physical; you can have therapy that is using drugs; you can also have psychological therapy.  When somebody says, “I'm in therapy,” they mean that they are going to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist to help them feel better.  Here, the word therapy is used to mean the physical or the drugs that this particular patient is getting.  In this case, the therapy is acupuncture.

My friend says that “She was skeptical when she first started.”  To be skeptical, “skeptical,” means to doubt - to question - to not believe something.  “I'm skeptical about men from Mars visiting our planet and building the pyramids of Egypt” - I don't believe that's true - I find it difficult to believe.  Actually, I think they came from Mercury, not Mars!

The story goes on that my friend was getting better “after only a few sessions.”  A session would be the time that she went into see the acupuncturist - her treatments.  She realized that acupuncture “was no New Age nonsense.”  New Age, “New Age,” is related to a belief - an idea - almost a religious idea about healing and health and spirituality that is used to help make people feel better. It's sort of like an alternative religion versus traditional religion, that's New Age.

When we use it in the United States, usually it is a negative term.  Someone says, “Oh, that's too New Age for me,” they mean that it is not something that they believe in - they're skeptical about it - they think it's nonsense - not true. Now, of course, I'm not saying whether these things are true or not; I'm just presenting my story here - a story.  Actually, not my story; my back doesn't hurt. My shoulder hurts, but not my back.

Getting back to the story, “My co-worker, Ray, suggested that I try some homeopathic treatments.”  Homeopathic, “homeopathic,” is a kind of medicine, again, an alternative kind of medicine that uses small amounts of something to treat an illness.  The belief, I think, is that you don't want a lot of a drug or a lot of some chemical or some herb, you want only just a little bit to help treat the person - to make the person better.

“My co-worker, Ray,” said that he was “taking herbal supplements that are all natural.”  Herbal, “herbal,” notice we don't normally pronounced the “h.”  It is possible to say herbal, but most people say herbal.  The word herbal comes from herbs, “herb,” or “herbs,” (plural) which are plants, and they are plants that you can make food out of; sometimes they are plants that you make medicine out of.

 Well, these are plants that you make medicine out of.  They're called supplements, “supplements,” because they're additional.  The word supplement means to add something additional - in addition to the normal or regular treatment that you may be receiving for your pain or your injury.

So, he's taking these herbal supplements, probably tea or some sort of pill that he takes.  He says that they're “all natural.”  When we say something is all natural, we mean that there aren't any man made or human made chemicals - no artificial ingredients.  Artificial is the opposite of natural.

My friend, or rather, my co-worker, Ray, got “injured on the job a couple of months ago.”  To be injured, “injured,” just means to be hurt - to have some problem with some part of your body: your arm, your leg, your knee, and so forth.

Ray took these herbal supplements “as complementary to traditional medication” that “his doctor gave him.”  To take something complementarily or as complementary means to take it in addition to.  When we say something complements something else, “complement,” we mean that it matches - that it goes with something else.  There's also a word complimentary, spelled with an “i,” which means to say something nice about someone.  These are drugs he's taking in addition to - to complement - his “traditional medication.”  Medication is another word for the drugs that he is taking.

He says that “even though the herbs” have not “undergone clinical trials, his experience” tells him that they are working.  To undergo means to experience or participate in.  Clinical trials are scientific tests that medical researchers do, usually, to make sure the drug actually works.

I end my story by saying that “I’m a little nervous about trying these unorthodox treatments.”  Unorthodox, “unorthodox,” is the opposite of orthodox, which means traditional.  So, unorthodox would be nontraditional or alternative kinds of treatments.

“After hearing about” my friend's and co-worker's “experiences,” I say, “I’m willing to give them a try.  Nothing has worked” for me “so far” - nothing has helped me so far, “so what do I have to lose?”  That expression, what do I have to lose, means it can't hurt and it might help.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a normal speed.

 [Start of story]

I have been suffering from back pain for years.  I’ve tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor, but nothing has had a lasting effect.  I finally decided to try alternative medicine.

My friend, Amelia, swore by acupuncture.  She said that her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy.  She was skeptical when she first started, but she knew after only a few sessions that it was working for her and that this was no New Age nonsense.  She thought it might work for me, too.

# A Mistake in the Hotel Bill

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 223: A Mistake in the Hotel Bill.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 223.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download the eight to ten page Learning Guide for this episode.  You can find all of the vocabulary, definitions, additional definitions, culture notes and a complete transcript of this episode.  Remember, if you have a question or comment about ESL Podcast, you can email us at eslpod@eslpod.com.

This episode is called, “A Mistake in the Hotel Bill.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Hotel clerk:  Here’s the bill for your four-night stay.  Would you like the incidentals charged to your credit card?

May:  Incidentals?  I think there’s some mistake.  I didn’t order any pay-per-view movies and I never ordered room service.  And, I didn’t have any spa services, either.

Hotel clerk:  Are you sure?  We show three movies and two room service orders.

May:  I’m positive.  Could I speak to a supervisor, please?

Hotel clerk:  He’s not on duty right now, but let me see if I can resolve this for you.  How many of these charges were made in error?

May:  All of them.  Is it possible that my bill was switched with another room’s? As I said, I didn’t order any movies, I haven’t had any room service, and I haven’t visited the spa since I checked in to the hotel.

Hotel clerk:  I see.  I’ll need to check with each of those departments to determine whether a mistake has been made.

May:  How long will this take?

 Hotel clerk:  Not long, I’m sure.  If you could take a seat in the lobby...

May:  I have a plane to catch and I don’t have a lot of time.  Is there a general manager I can speak to?

Hotel clerk:  I’m not sure.  If you’ll have a seat, I’ll see if I can get Ms. Cardenes for you.

May:  Thank you.  I’d appreciate it.

[End of story]

In our dialogue, we heard May and a hotel clerk having a conversation.

The hotel clerk says, “Here’s the bill for your four-night stay.  Would you like the incidentals charged to your credit card?”  The bill is what the person has to pay. A four-night stay, “stay,” means that the person slept in the hotel for four nights. You can say a four-night stay, a two-night stay, a one-week stay.  Stay, here, means the amount of time you are somewhere or you are visiting somewhere.

There are other meanings of that word, stay, and we talk about those in the Learning Guide today.

The clerk also asks if the woman, May, would “like the incidentals charged to” her “credit card.”  Incidentals, “incidentals,” are extra or additional costs that you have to pay for.  For example, if you stay at an American Hotel and you make a phone call, that might be extra - that might not be included in your overall bill. So, they are going to charge you more money if you make a phone call, especially if you make a long-distance phone call.

May says, “Incidentals?  I think there’s some mistake.”  She doesn't think that she has any incidental charges or any additional costs that she has to pay.  She then goes on and says that “I didn’t order any pay-per-view movies and I never ordered room service.  And, I didn’t have any spa services, either.”  Pay-per- view, which is often hyphenated, “pay-per-view,” are movies that you can watch in a hotel room and, in many cities, your own home if you have cable television or satellite television that you pay extra for.  They're not included in the normal price of, in this case, the hotel room.  Normally they charge eight, nine, maybe ten dollars a movie in a hotel, so they're not cheap - they're not inexpensive.

 She says that she didn't watch any of these movies and she “never ordered room service.”  Room service is food that you would get from the kitchen brought up to your room.  She also says that she didn't go to the spa - she “didn't have spa,” “spa,” “services.”  And, these are health or beauty treatments - going and getting your toenails and fingernails cut, for example, or having a massage.  These would be things that you would find at a very fancy or very expensive hotel, and they would be called spa services or spa services.

The hotel clerk questions her, “Are you sure?  We show three movies and two room service orders.”

And May says, “I’m positive.”  The expression to be positive means that you are absolutely sure - you have no doubt - you're certain that this is the truth.  May says, “I'm positive.  Could I speak to a supervisor, please?”  Supervisor would be the boss or a person at a higher level in the hotel.

The hotel clerk says, “He’s not on duty right now.”  To be on duty, “duty,” means to be working - to be at the hotel, in this case.  Well, the hotel clerk says the manager or the supervisor isn't “on duty, but” he says, “let me see if I can resolve this for you.”  To resolve, “resolve,” means, really, to solve a problem, and that's what he's trying to do, to solve this problem - to find a solution for the problem.

The clerk then asks May, “How many of these charges were made in error?”  In error means by mistake - someone did something wrong.

May says, “All of the them.”  All of the charges are a mistake - they're in error.  “Is it possible,” she asks, “that my bill was switched with another room's?”  To switch means to change, usually when one person or one thing is changed for another, often by accident.  She's saying here maybe I have someone else's bill - my bill was switched with someone else's.

She continues to go on and say that she “didn't order any movies” and she didn't have “any room service,” and she didn't visit the spa during her stay at the hotel. She says, “I haven't visited the spa since I checked in to the hotel.”  To check in would mean to register or to sign in.  When you first come to the hotel, the first day you are there, you check in.  You get your key; you give them your credit card and so forth.

The hotel clerk says, “I see” meaning I understand.  “I’ll need to check with each of those departments to determine whether a mistake has been made.”  He's

 saying here that he has to call or talk to the spa and the kitchen for the room service and so forth.

May says, “How long will this take?”  How long is this going to be?  The hotel clerk says, “Not long, I’m sure.  If you could take a seat in the lobby...” meaning if you want to go sit down and wait in the lobby while I make these phone calls. The lobby, “lobby,” is the main part of the hotel - the entrance to the hotel, where you can sit and people can wait.

The word lobby is one that has several different meanings, take a look at the Learning Guide for today for the other meanings of that word, lobby.

May isn't too happy.  She says, “I have a plane to catch,” meaning I have a airplane that I need to get to - I have to go to the airport so I can get on my plane. “I have a plane to catch and I don’t have a lot of time.  Is there a general manager I can speak” with?  Now she's asking to talk, not just with the hotel clerk's supervisor or boss, but with the main boss of the hotel - the general manager.

The hotel clerk says, “I’m not sure.  If you’ll have a seat, I’ll see if I can get Ms. Cardenes for you.”  He's going to see if he can get the hotel manager.  May says, “Thank you.  I’d appreciate it.”  I'd appreciate it meaning I would be very thankful if you could do that.  It's a polite thing to say when someone is going to do something for you.

What we're going to do for you is read this dialogue, this time at a regular, or normal, speed.

[Start of story]

Hotel clerk:  Here’s the bill for your four-night stay.  Would you like the incidentals charged to your credit card?

May:  Incidentals?  I think there’s some mistake.  I didn’t order any pay-per-view movies and I never ordered room service.  And, I didn’t have any spa services, either.

Hotel clerk:  Are you sure?  We show three movies and two room service orders.

May:  I’m positive.  Could I speak to a supervisor, please?

 Hotel clerk:  He’s not on duty right now, but let me see if I can resolve this for you.  How many of these charges were made in error?

May:  All of them.  Is it possible that my bill was switched with another room’s? As I said, I didn’t order any movies, I haven’t had any room service, and I haven’t visited the spa since I checked in to the hotel.

Hotel clerk:  I see.  I’ll need to check with each of those departments to determine whether a mistake has been made.

# Holiday Promotions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 224:  Holiday Promotions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 224.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  How are you today?

In this podcast, we are going to talk about buying things, or actually, selling things for the holiday season.  Remember, this episode will also have a Learning Guide on our website.  The Learning Guides include all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions that we don't talk about on the podcast, cultural notes and a free trip to Los Angeles.  Well okay, not a free trip to Los Angeles, but everything else is on the Learning Guide!  You can find those that at eslpod.com.  Now let's get started.

[Start of story]

My boss asked me to come up with some holiday promotion ideas so that we can make inroads into the gift-buying market.  For us to stay competitive, our company has to increase retail sales for this important sales cycle.  My boss is expecting some innovative ideas from me.

Since we’re an online business and not a brick-and-mortar store, we can’t just put signs in the window or do other types of traditional advertising.  Lucky for us, though, consumers are increasingly computer savvy and are more likely than ever to buy online.  That’s something we want to capitalize on.

Like other companies, we’re willing to slash prices to attract holiday shoppers. We have a large inventory and we don’t have to worry about running out of stock. The trick is, how do we increase sales without resorting to gimmicks?  Dressing up salespeople to look like Santa Claus may work for some businesses but not ours.

I’m just hoping that I can come up with some fresh ideas to jump-start this sales season.  I know that my boss is counting on me.

[End of story]

 The title for our podcast today is “Holiday Promotions.”  Holiday, when we are talking about December in the United States, means Christmas and the Jewish celebration of Chanukah.  A promotion, “promotion,” is when a company tries to sell something; it's like a sale.  It's something special a store will do to try to get people to buy gifts - buy things from their store.  That's one meaning of the word promotion, for additional meanings take a look at today's Learning Guide.

Our story begins by the woman saying that her boss had asked her “to come up with some holiday promotion ideas.”  To come, “come,” up with is an idiom, which means to think of - to invent - to create a new idea.  “I'm going to come up with some new things to do on ESL Podcast” - I'm going to create - I'm going to invent.  That is the meaning of that expression.

So, she has “to come up with some holiday promotion ideas,” and the reason she's doing this is that her company wants to “make inroads into the gift-buying market.”  To make inroads, “inroads,” (all one word) means to make progress - to advance.  Usually, we use this when we are talking about moving into a new area - making progress into a new and sometimes difficult area for our company or for whatever organization you're a member of.

Well, this company wants to make progress - inroads - into gift-buying markets or “the gift-buying market.”  The market is the group of people who will buy and sell things, in this case, will buy things.  She's talking about the gift-buying - people who will buy gifts - buy presents for the holiday season.  The word gift-buying is hyphenated, “gift-buying.”  You could also say, “the car-buying public,” or “car- buying market,” or “the PlayStation Portable Three-buying public.”  You can use that “-buying” with any sort of product or whatever is being sold.

She continues by saying that for her company “to stay competitive,” meaning to be as good as other companies, they have “to increase retail sales for this important sales cycle.”  Retail, “retail,” refers to things that you, as an individual, go in and buy in a store; that would be retail.  The opposite of retail is wholesale, “wholesale,” (one word) and wholesale is when companies buy from other companies, usually things that they are going to use and make for their own product.

This company wants to increase its retail sales in “this important sales cycle.” The word cycle, “cycle,” here just means the time or season of the year - the particular period that we're talking about.  For more information on the kinds of sales that are popular in the United States, take a look at the culture note in today's Learning Guide.

 The story continues with the woman saying that they have “an online business, not a brick-and-mortar store.”  Brick-and-mortar has become more popular in recent years as a way of distinguishing an online store - a website store - with a physical store - an actual store that you can go and visit.  The physical store would be called a brick-and-mortar store.  Brick, “brick,” is a kind of baked clay that usually is in the form of a rectangle, and it's used to make buildings.  It's a material for making buildings.  Mortar is a kind of cement that you put in between the bricks to keep the bricks together - to keep them from falling down.

She later says that “consumers” - people who buy their products - the things they sell - “are increasingly,” or in higher and higher numbers, “computer savvy.”  To be savvy, “savvy,” means to be knowledgeable about something - to know a lot about a particular topic.  Customers are “computer savvy,” and because of that, “are more likely than ever to buy online.”  The expression “more likely than ever” means that they have a better chance of doing this than before - that things have changed in such a way that now it is much easier or much more likely - much more probable - that they will do this.

“That’s something we want to capitalize on,” she says.  To capitalize, “capitalize,” means, in this case, to take advantage of - to profit from.  The word capitalize, as a verb, can also mean to make a letter bigger versus smaller.  The first letter of a sentence in English is capitalized; you capitalize the letter.  Here it means something very different; it means to take advantage of.

“Like other companies,” she says, her company is “willing to slash prices to attract holiday shoppers.”  To slash, “slash,” means, here, to cut or to reduce. So, the company will lower the prices in order to get more people to buy - “to attract holiday shoppers.”  Shoppers is just another name for consumers.

She says that they “have a large inventory.”  Inventory, “inventory,” is a word we use to describe how much of a particular product you have.  Usually, it's a list of what is in place, such as all of the things in your store.  So, if you sell cars and you have ten cars to sell, you have ten cars in your inventory.

Because her company has “a large inventory” - they have a lot of things they can sell - they're not worried “about running out of stock,” “stock.”  Stock is the number of things that you have in your store.  The expression “out of stock” means you don't have any of that in your store to sell.  The opposite of out of stock would be in stock.  So, you may ask someone at the store, “Do you have this shirt in stock,” means do you have it here at your store.  Again, like many

 words in English, stock has several different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide today for additional meanings.

The woman is worried, in our story, about increasing “sales without resorting to gimmicks.”  A gimmick, “gimmick,” is some unusual trick that would encourage people to do something, usually to buy something.  Resorting to - the verb to resort to - means that it is not something that you want to do.  It's going lower in terms of your standards or what you think is acceptable.  “Don't resort to calling people bad names,” that means don't go that low in terms of your standards or your ethics or your morals.

Here, when she says, “resorting to gimmicks,” she means that it's not something they want to do - they don't want to have gimmicks to sell their products.  She gives an example of that as “Dressing up salespeople to look like Santa Claus,” that would be a gimmick - a trick to get people to buy more.

She ends her story by saying that she hopes she “can come up with some fresh ideas,” or new ideas, “to jump-start this sales season.”  The expression to jump, “jump,” start, “start,” means to begin something quickly, usually to begin something that is difficult to start.  In this case, she wants to jump-start sales - she wants increase the sales quickly right at the beginning.

She says, finally, that she knows that her boss is counting on her.  To count, “count,” on someone means to rely or depend on something or someone.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

My boss asked me to come up with some holiday promotion ideas so that we can make inroads into the gift-buying market.  For us to stay competitive, our company has to increase retail sales for this important sales cycle.  My boss is expecting some innovative ideas from me.

Since we’re an online business and not a brick-and-mortar store, we can’t just put signs in the window or do other types of traditional advertising.  Lucky for us, though, consumers are increasingly computer savvy and are more likely than ever to buy online.  That’s something we want to capitalize on.

Like other companies, we’re willing to slash prices to attract holiday shoppers. We have a large inventory and we don’t have to worry about running out of stock.

 The trick is, how do we increase sales without resorting to gimmicks?  Dressing up salespeople to look like Santa Claus may work for some businesses but not ours.

I’m just hoping that I can come up with some fresh ideas to jump-start this sales season.  I know that my boss is counting on me.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 225:  Feeling Homesick.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 225.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.    Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com and download the Learning Guide for this podcast.  Today's podcast is called “Feeling Homesick.”  Let's get started.  [Start of story]  Annie:  Why the long face?  Luis:  I don’t know.  I guess I’m feeling a little homesick.    Annie:  I thought you got over that.  I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but I thought you were coping pretty well.    Luis:  I was.  It’s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’t be able to go home because I can’t afford the airfare.  I’m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’s cooking and being around my family.  Annie:  Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.  When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home.  But, you know, I think I was just seeing things through rose-colored glasses.  Luis:  What do you mean?  Annie:  Well, things back home weren’t really that idyllic, but from this distance, all I could think of was the good stuff and none of the bad.    Luis:  I see what you mean, but I’m still bummed out.  Annie:  I have an idea.  Why don’t we put on our own little holiday celebration?  We can have it at my place and we can invite all of our friends who are on their # Holiday Decorating

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 226: Holiday Decorating.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 226.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can find there the Learning Guide for this episode, which contains all of the vocabulary words, definitions, sample sentences, additional cultural notes, explanations of words we that don't talk about on the podcast and a complete transcript of this episode.

This podcast is about “Holiday Decorating.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Now that the holidays are here, it’s time to decorate the house.  Every year, we always go all out.  We buy a Christmas tree and the kids decorate it with ornaments that we’ve bought and made over the years, and with silver and gold tinsel.  We also hang a wreath on our front door and I make sure that there’s mistletoe above every door.  Around the chimney, we hang our stockings, and when we get holiday cards from our friends and neighbors, we put them all around the room.

Outside of the house, we have lawn ornaments that we put in the front yard. People who visit our house will see snowmen (and snowwomen), reindeer, and of course, Santa Claus.  The best part is the outdoor lights.  I string them across the front of the house, around our trees, and in our fence.  When I turn them all on, you can probably see our house from miles away.  It’s no wonder that people come from all over town just to see our house at night.  I have to say that I enjoy the holiday season as much as the kids...and maybe just a little more!

[End of story]

Our podcast is called “Holiday Decorating.”  Holiday usually refers to Christmas and New Years and perhaps Chanukah, the Jewish celebration.  This particular episode is mostly about Christmas decorations, since that is probably the most popular holiday celebration, at least in the United States.

 The story begins by me saying that “the holidays are here,” meaning we are now in the time of the holidays, and “it's time to decorate the house.”  To decorate, “decorate,” means to make something more beautiful or more attractive, usually by putting objects - putting something on it, like your house or a tree.  There are other meanings of this word to decorate that we discuss in the Learning Guide for this episode.

The story continues that “Every year, we always go all out.”  That expression, to go all out, “out,” means to put all of your energy into something - that you are going to do something using the maximum amount of effort.  In this case, going all out means that we bought a Christmas tree.  A Christmas tree is a large, usually green, tree that people buy.

In many American cities, there are Christmas tree lots, “lots.”  A lot is just an empty space, usually outside, that has, in this case, lots of Christmas trees and you can go and buy them.  You can't buy a Christmas tree, at least a real tree, in a store - in a regular store; you need to go to one of these temporary stores - these Christmas tree lots - to buy a tree.  If you want an artificial tree - a tree made of plastic or metal - then you can get that at a store.

Now, this is something I really don't have much experience with; we never had a real Christmas tree when I was growing up.  But this is the story, and in the story, there's a Christmas tree.  All the kids are going to decorate the tree with ornaments.  An ornament, “ornament,” is an object that you use to decorate. Ornaments are little things for a Christmas tree that you hang on the tree or put on the branches of the tree.  Often, these ornaments are round and they have a little piece of metal on top that you can hang it on the branch of the tree - the arms of the tree that come out.

We've also bought some “silver and gold tinsel.”  Tinsel, “tinsel,” is another one of those words that you usually only hear during the Christmas season.  Tinsel is a narrow piece of a shiny material that's used for decoration.  It's usually like a long string, and the string has metal on it often, or something that is very shiny - something that reflects the light.  And often, pieces of tinsel are different colors. In this case, they're silver and gold tinsel.  It's traditional to have both Christmas ornaments and tinsel on your Christmas tree.

“We also hang a wreath on our front door and I make sure that there’s mistletoe above every door.”  A wreath, “wreath,” is a circle - a round thing - that is made of tree branches usually.  It could also be made of flowers.  And, it is something

 that, in the United States, is often found on the door - outside door - of your house during the Christmas season - during the time of Christmas.

I remember when I was young boy, I was a member of the Boy Scouts, which is a voluntary organization of boys - to keep them from causing trouble, I think - and we used to sell these Christmas wreaths in order to make money for the Boy Scout organization.  So, I have many memories of going and selling Christmas wreaths.

In addition to a Christmas wreath in the story, there's also mistletoe.  Mistletoe, “mistletoe,” (one word) is a special plant that has green leaves and little white what we would call berries - little round things.  And, this little plant, or a piece of a plant, is used in Christmas; it is often hung up on the top of a door.  Now, the tradition is that if you are standing under a mistletoe with someone else, you are supposed to kiss that person.  The other person, you hope, wants to kiss you as well.  If not, then in addition to a kiss, you will also get a black eye when they hit you, especially if you're a man trying to kiss a woman.  Well, that's been my experience!

The story continues by saying that “Around the chimney, we hang our stockings.” The chimney, “chimney,” is a brick or rock part of the house.  It is connected to something called a fireplace, “fireplace.”  A fireplace is where you burn wood inside a house to keep it warm.

Many houses, now, don't have fireplaces; my house doesn't have a fireplace, but older houses or houses of rich people sometimes have these old fireplaces.  If you burn wood, you will have smoke, and so you need to take the smoke out of the room, and you do that through the chimney.  It's a long, narrow part of the house.  On the top of the chimney is at the top of the house, and that's where the smoke goes outside.

Traditionally, Santa Claus, when he comes to visit, will land on the top of your house - the roof of your house - and then come down the chimney.  That's why his clothes always get dirty, because he's climbing in those chimneys!

Well, “Around the chimney,” - around the fireplace - “we hang our stockings.” Stockings, “stockings,” are large, usually very colorful socks.  They're big socks, not real socks that you would put on your feet.  But, they are large socks that are filled with presents on the night before Christmas.  Again traditionally, you put things in the stockings - a parent would put gifts in stockings for their children.

 In my house, growing up, we had a stocking for everyone in the house, which means we had 13 stockings.  So, it was sort of like walking into our house and it looked like my mother was drying the clothes because we had so many of these stockings!

The things you put in a stocking - the gifts - are usually small gifts.  They're sometimes called stocking stuffers, “stuffers.”  To stuff means to put something into something else; that's what you do with a stocking stuffer, a small gift.

Another tradition is the holiday card or the Christmas card.  These are cards that people send each other.  We may also call them greeting cards.  The cards have a picture of something related to Christmas - a Christmas tree or perhaps Santa Claus - and you write notes in to your friends and family and wish them a Merry Christmas.

You can also make your own cards.  Some families make cards with pictures of their children and send them to you.  It was very popular, and still is in some families, to send out a Christmas letter, where you would describe to your friends and family everything you did or all the most important things that happened to you in the past year.  These are always very entertaining to get.  I suppose nowadays you could just have a blog and you wouldn't need to send anyone a letter.

The story goes on to say that “Outside of the house, we have lawn ornaments that we put in the front yard.”  The lawn, “lawn,” is the - is the area of grass in front of the house.  There's also, often, a lawn in the back of your house.  Lawn ornaments are figures - objects - statues - that you put in front of your house that are about Christmas or related to Christmas.  Some of these ornaments or statues are of snowmen.  Snowmen are made of snow - round balls of snow - to look like a man.  Usually three balls of snow:  one large one, one medium one and one small one.  The small one is the head.  There's also lawn ornaments that look like reindeers.  A reindeer, “reindeer,” is the animal, which according to tradition, is part of Santa Claus' transportation.  And of course, Santa Claus himself.

“The best part,” I say in the story, “is the outdoor lights.”  It's become very popular in the United States to put Christmas lights on the outside of your house.  Not just one or two strings of lights, we would call them, but hundreds and hundreds of lights, very sophisticated, complicated sets of lights with different colors.  This has almost become a competition in some cities, where people try to have the most complicated or most beautiful set of outdoor lights.  This is not something

 that I do, ever, but it is interesting to see because at night you can drive by the house and it looks very beautiful with all of these lights on it.

The verb that we use is to string.  When we say we're going to string lights, we mean we're going to hang them in a line.  The lights usually come on something like a long rope, and there are lots of lights in a straight line and you can string those, or put those, in the front of your house.

I say at the end that “It’s no wonder that people come from all over town just to see our house at night.”  It's no wonder is an expression that means it isn't surprising - it's logical - it would be expected that people would come from all over town.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Now that the holidays are here, it’s time to decorate the house.  Every year, we always go all out.  We buy a Christmas tree and the kids decorate it with ornaments that we’ve bought and made over the years, and with silver and gold tinsel.  We also hang a wreath on our front door and I make sure that there’s mistletoe above every door.  Around the chimney, we hang our stockings, and when we get holiday cards from our friends and neighbors, we put them all around the room.

# Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

Welcome to English as a Seco nd Language Podcast number 227: Describing Symptoms to a Doctor.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 227.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com and download a copy of the Learning Guide for this podcast.

The topic for today's podcast is “Describing Symptoms to a Doctor.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Dr. van Eyck:  Good morning, I’m Dr. van E yck.  I understand that you’re not feeling well.

Nico:  That’s right, doctor.  I’ve had a stomachache for three days.  The pain comes and goes, but I also have heartburn and I am feeling bloated all the time.

Dr. van Eyck:  Well, let’s take a look.  Ha ve you felt nauseous?  Does it hurt when I press here?

Nico:  Oh yes, that hurts, and I feel nauseous all the time.  But, doctor, that’s not all.  I’ve also had bad headaches in the past week and I feel fatigued all the time.

Dr. van Eyck:  Have you had a stuffy nose, a cough, a sore throat, or an earache?

Nico:  Yes, I’ve had all of those.

Dr. van Eyck:  You have?  All of them?

Nico:  And, there’s more.  I’ve been feeling pains in my leg.  Sometimes it feels stiff and sometimes I lose feeling in  it.  I’m having a lot of trouble walking.

Dr. van Eyck:  I have to say that you have an unusual combination of symptoms. Have there been any significant changes in your life in the past few days?

ESL Podcast 22 7 – Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

 Nico:  Well, my in -laws are visiting from out of town.  Do you think you’ll need to admit me into the hospital for tests?

Dr. van Eyck:  I’m not sure that’s necessary.  Are things really that bad at home?

Nico:  You have no idea!

[End of story]

Our podcast is entitled “Describing Symptoms to a Doctor.”  Sym ptoms, “symptoms,” are indications or signs that there is something wrong with your body.  So, if your leg hurts, that's a symptom of, perhaps, a damaged muscle or some other problem in your leg.

This podcast is about telling the doctor what your sympto ms are, and we talk about some common symptoms that you might talk to a doctor about.  In our dialogue, the doctor, Dr. van Eyck, comes in and says to the patient - the person who is sick - “I understand that you’re not feeling well.”

The patient, Nico, s ays, “That’s right, doctor.  I’ve had a stomachache for three days.”  A stomachache, “stomachache,” is two words made one word.  Stomach is where the food goes in your body when you eat, and ache means to hurt.  So, when you say you have a stomachache, you  mean that your stomach hurts.

This poor Nico has “had a stomachache for three days.  The pain comes and goes, but I also have heartburn and I am feeling bloated all the time.”  The expression the pain comes and goes means that sometimes you have pain a nd then, maybe a few minutes later, you don't have pain.  Anything that comes and goes is present and then is not present - you have it and then you don't have it, and then you may have it again.

This patient also has heartburn.  Heartburn, “heartburn,” ( one word) isn't really about your heart; heartburn is a pain that you feel near your heart, above your stomach in your chest, but it is caused by, usually, some problem with your eating - something that you have eaten and you have this pain.  So, you can have a stomachache and you can also have heartburn.

Nico also says he's “feeling bloated all of the time.”  To be bloated, “bloated,” means to feel like you're full of water or perhaps food or something else, and your body feels too full, like you've eaten  too much.

ESL Podcast 22 7 – Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

 Dr. van Eyck then asks Nico if he has “felt nauseous,” “nauseous.”  To feel or to be nauseous means that your stomach is not feeling well, and you think that you may want to vomit or throw up.  To vomit, “vomit,” is when food that was in your stomach goes back out your mouth.  Not a very nice thing to happen, for most people.  Feeling nauseous is when you feel like you may very soon throw up.

Dr. van Eyck says, “Does it hurt when I press here,” and obviously, she takes her hand and perhaps puts  it on Nico's stomach.  To press, “press,” means to push - to use force on something, usually with your hand.  There are other meanings of the word press, and if you look in today's Learning Guide, we talk about some additional meanings of this word.

Nico says, “Oh yes, that hurts,” meaning the place where the doctor is pressing her hand is hurting him.  He says, he feels “nauseous all the time.  But, doctor, that’s not all,” he says.  He has even more problems.  He says, “I’ve also had bad headaches in the past week and I feel fatigued all the time.”  A headache, “headache,” is one word like stomachache, and it means, you can guess, that your head has some pain.  I have a headache, for example, when I watch the television news and see all the terrible thin gs going on the world; that gives me a headache.  What also gives me a headache is my neighbor and his loud noise. Well, I won't tell you about my problems!

Nico's problem is that he has “bad headaches,” or headaches that are very severe, we might say, “ severe” - headaches that hurt a lot.  He also feels fatigued, “fatigued.”  To feel to be fatigued means to feel very tired.

Dr. van Eyck asks Nico about some other possible symptoms.  He says, “Have you had a stuffy nose, a cough, a sore throat, or an ear ache?”  Let's start with the first one of these, a stuffy, “stuffy,” nose.  A stuffy nose is when your nose has some liquid in it that makes it difficult for you to breathe using your nose; you have to use your mouth.  If you have a stuffy nose, one thing that you do if you blow your nose, “blow.”  To blow your nose means to use air to get the liquid out of your nose.

Dr. van Eyck asks if Nico has “a cough,” “cough.”  A cough is like this (sound of cough).  That's a cough.  A sore, “sore,” throat is when y our throat hurts.  It's like a throat ache, but we don't say throat ache, we say a sore throat.  When you swallow, for example, your throat hurts.  Your throat is what connects your mouth to your stomach.  An earache, “earache,” is, again you can guess, a pain in your ear.  So, we have stomachache, we have headache we have earache, you can

ESL Podcast 22 7 – Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

 have a backache, a side ache, where the side of your body aches; all of these are ways of describing a part of your body that hurts.  Nico says, “Yes, I’ve had all of tho se,” he has all those symptoms.  Dr. van Eyck is a little surprised.  She says, “All of them?”

And Nico says, “And, there’s more,” meaning I have even more things wrong with me.  “I’ve been feeling pains in my leg.  Sometimes” my leg “feels stiff,” “stiff .” When we say your leg feels stiff, we mean it's difficult to move - it hurts when you try to move it.  He also says that he's losing feeling in his legs.  To lose feeling means to not be able to feel anything - to have no feeling in one part of your body.  This expression, to lose feeling, has some additional meanings, which we discuss in our Learning Guide.

Dr. van Eyck then says, “I have to say that you have an unusual combination of symptoms.”  This expression, I have to say, is one we sometimes use when we are going to be honest with a person but it may, somehow, hurt them or make them feel bad.  Dr. van Eyck says have you had any other “significant changes in your life in the past few days?”

Nico responds, “Well, my in -laws are visiting from out of  town.”  Your in -laws, “in - laws,” are usually the parents of your husband or your wife.  So, the mother of your wife would be your mother -in-law and father of your wife would be your father -in-law, and together, we would say they were your in -laws.  You ca n also have a brother -in-law and a sister -in-law; these would be the brothers and sisters of your spouse - your husband or your wife.  Of course, in -laws, especially mother -in-laws, are often associated with problems - that people don't get along with or l ike their mother -in-law or their father -in-law.  Usually it's the mother -in- law; there are a lot of jokes about this.

So, Nico says his “in -laws are visiting from out of town” - from another city.  “Do you think you’ll need to admit me into the hospital f or tests?”  This is a question he's asking Dr. van Eyck.  To admit, “admit,” someone means to send someone to a hospital.  This question is sort of a joke; Nico is hoping to escape his in -laws, if he goes to the hospital, he won't have to be with them.

Dr. van Eyck says, “I’m not sure that’s necessary.  Are things really that bad at home” - is your situation very bad?  And Nico says, “You have no idea,” meaning yes, you can't even imagine.  Poor Nico!

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

ESL Podcast 22 7 – Describing Symptoms to a Doctor

 [Start of story]

Dr. van Eyck:  Good morning, I’m Dr. van Eyck.  I understand that you’re not feeling well.

Nico:  That’s right, doctor.  I’ve had a stomachache for three days.  The pain comes and goes, but I also have heartburn and I am feelin g bloated all the time.

Dr. van Eyck:  Well, let’s take a look.  Have you felt nauseous?  Does it hurt when I press here?

Nico:  Oh yes, that hurts, and I feel nauseous all the time.  But, doctor, that’s not all.  I’ve also had bad headaches in the p ast week and I feel fatigued all the time.

Ho, ho, ho!  Merry Christmas!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast  number 228.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los Angeles, California.  I want to thank Santa Claus for coming on our program today and wishing us all a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone on this Christmas holida y edition of ESL Podcast.

Our topic today is called “A Christmas Feast.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

This year, our family decided that the more the merrier and invited Adriano and his family to have Christmas dinner with us.  We were thrilled when they accepted our invitation.

Lucy:  I’m so glad you guys could all make it.

Adriano:  We wouldn’t have missed it f or anything.  We brought a fruitcake.

Lucy:  Oh, thanks.  Make yourselves comfortable.  We’re just about to sit down to dinner.

Adriano:  Wow, it looks like you’ve prepared a feast.

Lucy:  Yeah, we did go a little overboard this year.  We’ve got a t urkey, a roast and a ham, and all the trimmings: stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce.  Help yourself to some eggnog.

Adriano:  Thanks.  Did you do all of the cooking yourself?

Save room for the pumpkin pie, the gingerbread house, and the Christmas cookies.  Okay everybody, dinner’s ready.  Adriano, would you carve the bird?

Adriano:  I’d be happy to do the honors.

[End of story]

Our dialogue today begins by Lucy sayin g that “This year” her “family decided that the more the merrier and invited Adriano and his family to have Christmas dinner with us.”  The expression the more the merrier, “merrier,” means the more people you have, the more fun or the more happy something  will be.  To be merry, “merry,” means to be happy, which is why we say, “Merry Christmas.”  We don't normally say, “Happy Christmas” in English, we say, “Merry Christmas.” We do say, “Happy New Year.”  Merry is just another word for happy.  The expressio n the more the merrier means more people will be more fun.

Lucy says her family was “thrilled when” Adriano and his family “accepted our invitation.”  To be thrilled, “thrilled,” means to be very happy - to be delighted.  “I am thrilled that my wife is go ing to give me a new fifth generation iPod for Christmas.”  She doesn't know that yet, but she will!

Lucy begins the dialogue by saying, “I’m so glad you guys could all make it.” Notice the use of the word guys, “guys,” here; it's an informal way of refe rring to you all.  We don't have in English, as in many languages, a plural you, so “you guys” is an informal way of communicating that idea.

Lucy says that she is glad that Adriano and his family could make it, meaning could come to the party.  Adriano s ays, “We wouldn’t have missed it for anything,” it was very important for us, in other words.  He says, “We brought a fruitcake.”  A fruitcake, “fruitcake,” (one word) is a traditional Christmas cake that usually contains little pieces of dried fruit.  My mother used to make fruitcake every year, and we would give the fruitcake to our teachers for Christmas. Maybe that's why I didn't get very good grades when I was in school, I don't know.  I'm kidding, of course.  My mother made wonderful fruitcake!

The expression fruitcake is also sometimes used to mean someone who's crazy - someone who's not very intelligent.  “He's a fruitcake” means he's kind of weird - he's odd - he's unusual.

Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  7 Lucy says to Adriano, “ Oh, thanks.  Make yourselves comfortable.  We’re just about to sit down to dinner.”  The expression to sit down to dinner is one that we usually use when we are at home and we are going to eat, in this case, dinner. We probably wouldn't say that in a restaurant.  But if someone calls you on the phone an d you don't want to talk or you don't have time to talk, you could say, if it's five, six, seven o'clock, “We're just about to sit down to dinner” - we're just about to eat.  This is a good excuse.  There is an expression, a sit down dinner, and that just means a dinner where it is more formal - where everyone is sitting down versus going to McDonald's, for example.

Adriano says, “Wow, it looks like you’ve prepared a feast.”  A feast, “feast,” is a large meal, usually for many different people with lots of  different types of food. Lucy says, “Yeah, we did go a little overboard this year.”  To go overboard means to do beyond what you would normally do - to do a lot, usually to do too much.  To be too enthusiastic about something, that would be to go overboa rd. So, if you have a fight your friend - a disagreement with your friend - and you decide to go and buy him a new car because you want him to be happy, that would be going overboard.  That would be doing too much, unless of course, you had ruined or dest royed his car, in which case it would not be going overboard.

Well, Lucy says she's gone overboard, and then she says all of the things that they're going to eat.  She says, “We’ve got a turkey,” which is traditional for both Thanksgiving and Christmas in  the United States.  She also says that they have “a roast and a ham.”  These are other two popular foods for Christmas.  A roast, “roast,” is a large piece of beef or pork that you cook in an oven.  A ham, “ham,” is a kind of pork - meat that comes from a  pig.  Beef comes from a cow; pork comes from a pig.  But we don't say, “I'm going to eat some cow,” or “I'm going to eat some pig,” we say, “I'm going to eat some beef,” or if it's from a pig, “we're going to eat pork.”  One type of pork is ham, “ham,” wh ich is, I believe, from the top part of a pig's leg.  I don't normally kill my own pigs, but I think that's where it comes from.

Lucy also says that they're going to have all of “the trimmings.”  The trimmings, when we talk about food, are the things othe r than the main meat dish, and she lists what those are.  She says they're going to have stuffing, “stuffing,” which is a mix of bread and vegetables, sometimes even fruit, and it's often put inside the turkey or a chicken, maybe duck, and it's cooked insi de.  It's like little pieces of cooked bread.

Yams, “yams,” is a vegetable - it's an orange vegetable.  It's like a sweet potato; sometimes people use the same term but they are a little different.  Don't ask me

Thes e materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educational Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  8 what the difference it is because I don't l ike yams or sweet potatoes, but Lucy didn't invite me to dinner, did she?  She invited Adriano, so it doesn't matter if I like yams or not, I'm not going to eat them!

Mashed potatoes are a type of potato, which again is a vegetable that grows in the groun d.  Mashed potatoes is when you take the vegetable - the potato - you take the skin off of it - the outside - and you mash it.  To mash, “mash,” means to crush - to make into small, little pieces.  Normally with mashed potatoes you put some milk in, usuall y some butter, you mix it altogether and it's - it's very good!

Cranberry sauce, “cranberry” sauce is very popular with turkey, especially at Thanksgiving.  Cranberry is a fruit.  It is usually combined with some sugar; it's almost like a desert, and it o ften served with turkey.

Finally, at Lucy's feast they're going to have eggnog, “eggnog.”  Eggnog is a special holiday drink that is made from milk and eggs and usually a little alcohol. You can have eggnog with alcohol or without alcohol.  Although eggn og and fruitcake are both traditionally popular at Christmas, a lot of people don't like them.

Adriano says, “Thanks.  Did you do all of the cooking yourself?”  Lucy says that she “had some help and everybody brought different desserts.”  She then says to Adriano, “Save room for the pumpkin pie, the gingerbread house, and the Christmas cookies.”  The expression to save room for something means don't eat too much now so that you can eat something different later, in this case the dessert, what you eat after  the main meal.

A couple of popular desserts for the holidays are pumpkin pie, “pumpkin” pie.  A pumpkin is a vegetable that is usually associated with Halloween.  The inside of the pumpkin is mixed together with other ingredients, and you make it into a pie that you bake in the oven.  You can eat it hot or cold.  A gingerbread house is a traditional Christmas dessert that is made of cookies.  The cookies are ginger cookies, a type of cookie.  You put them into the shape of or you make a little house from the cookies.  I, myself, have never eaten a, or part of a gingerbread house, but it is a traditional kind of desert.

Lucy says, “Okay everybody, dinner’s ready.  Adriano, would you carve the bird?” To carve, “carve,” the bird usually means to cut the tur key that has been in the oven.  You take it out of the oven and you have to cut the pieces of meat off of it. You can also carve a chicken or a duck as well.  You put them in a plate - the pieces of meat on a plate and then people can take what they want.

Thes e materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educational Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  9 Adriano says, “I’d be happy to do the honors.”  The expression to do the honors means usually to do something important, often something official, but here it just means that he will do the carving of the turkey.  The expression to do the honors has some  different meanings, if you look at today's Learning Guide, you can find out what the other uses of that expression are, as well as the expression to go a little overboard.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[Start of story]

This year, our family decided that the more the merrier and invited Adriano and his family to have Christmas dinner with us.  We were thrilled when they accepted our invitation.

Lucy:  I’m so glad you guys could all make it.

Adriano:  We wouldn’t have  missed it for anything.  We brought a fruitcake.

Lucy:  Oh, thanks.  Make yourselves comfortable.  We’re just about to sit down to dinner.

Adriano:  Wow, it looks like you’ve prepared a feast.

Lucy:  Yeah, we did go a little overboard this year.  W e’ve got a turkey, a roast and a ham, and all the trimmings: stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce.  Help yourself to some eggnog.

Adriano:  Thanks.  Did you do all of the cooking yourself?

Lucy:  I had some help and everybody brought diff erent desserts.  Save room for the pumpkin pie, the gingerbread house, and the Christmas cookies.  Okay everybody, dinner’s ready.  Adriano, would you carve the bird?

Adriano:  I’d be happy to do the honors.

# Irritating Co-workers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 229: Irritating Co - workers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 229.  I'm your  host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Be sure to visit our website at eslpod.com, and download the Learning Guide for this episode.

On this podcast, we are going to ta lk about people you work with that may sometimes irritate or bother you.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Since our office reorganization, I’ve been sharing an office with Isabel.  We’ve been getting on each other’s nerves.

Pete:  Hey, Isabel, can  you cut that out?

Isabel:  Cut what out?  I’m not doing anything.

Pete:  You’re tapping your pencil on your desk.  It’s driving me crazy.

Isabel:  Okay, I will if you’ll stop slurping your coffee.

Pete:  I don’t slurp my coffee.  And plus, how can  you hear it when you’re shouting into your phone all the time?

Isabel:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  You’re complaining about me talking on the phone when your friend Deepak stops by ten times a day to shoot the breeze?  I can’t stand that guy.

Pete:   It’s no skin off my nose if you don’t like Deepak.  Look, we have a lot of pent-up anger from working in these close quarters, and it’s probably okay to let off steam once in a while.  But, it’s probably not a good idea to keep it up.  I’m willing to for give and forget if you are.

Pete:  Yeah, I’ll try to do the same.

[End of story]

Our podcast today is called “Irritating Co -workers.”  To irritate, “ir ritate,” means to get someone mad or to bother someone.

Our story begins by Pete saying that since their office had been reorganized - since they had changed the company and who was working with whom - now he has to share “an office with Isabel.  We’ve be en getting on each other’s nerves,” Pete says.  To get on someone's nerves, “nerves,” means the same as to irritate someone.  It's another way of saying that you are bothering or annoying someone.  To annoy, “annoy,” is similar to irritate.  So, you're get ting on my nerves - or that person is getting on his nerves.

Pete says, “Hey, Isabel, can you cut that out?”  To cut something out means to stop it.  It's an informal expression, usually something that would be considered impolite or rude.  If you say t o a child, “Cut that out,” you're telling the child to stop doing what they're doing.  So, it's not a nice thing to say, not something you would want to say to your co -workers - the people you work with.

Isabel says, “Cut what out?  I’m not doing anything .”  And Pete says, “You’re tapping your pencil on the desk.”  To tap, “tap,” means to hit lightly.  Isabel is taking her pencil and she's hitting it on the desk several times.  Pete says that this is driving him crazy.  To drive someone crazy is, again, si milar to to get on someone's nerves; it means to annoy or to irritate.  There was also a song, I think in the 1980s, (Jeff sings) “She drives me crazy - ooh - ooh.”  When a woman drives you crazy, you mean you love her a lot - you are very excited to be wi th her.  It means something very different than the normal meaning, which is when someone drives you crazy, they bother you - they annoy you.  Unless it's a beautiful woman, in that case, it would be a good thing!

Isabel says, “Okay,” I'll stop tapping my  pencil, if you, Pete, will “stop slurping your coffee.”  To slurp, “slurp,” means to make a noise when you are drinking something.  It's considered somewhat rude in United States to do that.  For example, if you are sipping your tea and you go (Jeff slurp s), that would be considered impolite - not a nice thing to do.

These m aterials are copyrighted by the Center for Educational Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  7 Pete says that he doesn't slurp his coffee - he disagrees with Isabel.  “And plus,” he says, or in addition, “how can you hear it when you’re shouting into your phone all the time?”  Because Isabel talks into her phone loudly, Pete is saying that she could not hear him slurping his coffee, even if he was slurping his coffee.

Isabel says, “You’ve got to be kidding me!”  This, again, is an informal expression, which means you must be joking - I can't believe I'm hearing what you are telling me or you cannot be serious - this is wrong - you've got to be kidding me.  Not something you would say to your boss; maybe something you could say to a friend.  It means that you don't believe the other pers on.

Isabel says, “You’re complaining about me talking on the phone when your friend Deepak stops by ten times a day to shoot the breeze?”  Isabel is saying how can you complain about me when your friend is always here talking to you.  To shoot, “shoot,” t he breeze, “breeze,” means to gossip - to talk, usually not about anything very serious, to have a relaxed conversation.

Isabel goes on to say, “I can't stand” Deepak - “I can't stand that guy.”  To not be able to stand someone or something means to not  be able to put up with or to tolerate someone or something - to be frustrated - to be tired of being bothered by that thing or that person.  If you say, “I can't stand my mother -in-law,” you mean I don't like her - I don't get along with her.  That's just  an example, of course!

Pete says, “It’s no skin off my nose if you don’t like Deepak.”  The expression it's no skin, “skin,” off my nose, “nose,” means that something isn't important or doesn't matter to someone because it doesn't effect him or her.  You  might say, “It's snowing in Moscow, but that's no skin off my nose,” meaning I don't care - it doesn't bother me - it's not important to me because I'm not affected by it.

Pete says, “Look, we have a lot of pent -up anger from working in these close quart ers.”  When something is pent -up, “pent” (hyphen) up, you mean that it is building up over time.  Usually emotions that you haven't expressed, anger for example.  It's something that bothers you for a long time; you can get pent -up anger.  The anger is ins ide you and it hasn't been let out, and that's what Pete is saying.  “We have a lot of pent -up anger.”

The reason is because they are working in close quarters, “quarters.”  Quarters, here, just means the space or an area.  Close quarters would mean that it is a very crowded space, where you don't have a lot of room, and that is the problem with Pete and Isabel.  They're in an office and they have to share one office.

These m aterials are copyrighted by the Center for Educational Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  8 Pete says, “it’s probably okay to let off steam once in a while.”  The expression to let off steam, “steam,” means to do something to get rid of those negative emotions - those negative feelings.  Maybe you will go play a sport or maybe you will yell or get angry at someone to let off steam.

“It’s probably not a good idea,” Pete says, “to ke ep it up.”  To keep something up means to continue to do something.  Someone says to you, “Keep it up, you're doing a good job,” you mean continue doing what you are doing.  It could be a good thing; it could be a bad thing.  To keep it up means to continu e.

There are other meanings of the word or expression keep it up and close quarters, and we talk about those in today's Learning Guide.  Take a look at that.

Pete says, “I’m willing to forgive and forget if you are.”  The expression to forgive and forget  means to stop fighting, apologize to the other person and behave or act as if nothing had happened.  To forgive and forget means to forgive the other person and forget about your disagreements.

Isabel says, “Fine” - okay.  “Let’s call a truce.”  A truc e, “truce,” is an agreement to stop fighting, usually between two countries, but here she's using it to mean between herself and Pete.  “Let’s call a truce,” notice we use the verb to call, means let's begin - let's start a truce - let's stop fighting.  Wh ile

Isabel says, “I’ll try to be more considerate and to keep the noise down.”  To be considerate, “considerate,” means to be nice to someone - to be thoughtful - to be careful not hurt someone else's feelings.  To keep the noise down means to be less noi sy - not to be so loud.

And Pete says, “Yeah, I’ll try to do the same.”  So now, everyone is happy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

# A New Year¡¦s Cruise

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 230: A New Year’s Cruise.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 230.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Today we have a special New Year's edition of ESL Podcast.  Our topic today is going to be talking about “A New Year’s Cruise.”

Remember to visit our websit e at eslpod.com.  There you can download the Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, sample sentences, additional vocabulary and a complete transcript of this podcast.  Now let's get started.

[Start of story]

My friends and  I decided to do something a little different this year.  Instead of going to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year’s Eve, we decided to take a harbor cruise instead.  The cruise would be four hours long, and it included dinner, music, dancing, an d a great view of the fireworks.

On that day, we drove to the marina and we were among the first to board the ship.  This was no little boat.  It was a large ship with an upper and a lower deck. The crew helped us get on board and showed us where the l ife jackets were in case of an emergency.  Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers.

We had a great time.  I didn’t get seasick as I’d feared, and we didn’t have to call out the Coast Guard, either.  We had so much fun, we didn’t want to go b ack on shore.  Finally, the captain joked that if we didn’t leave, he’d make us walk the plank!

[End of story]

Today, we learned what Lucy and her friends did on New Year's Eve; they went on a New Year's Cruise.  A cruise, “cruise,” is usually a relaxing  trip that you take on an ocean, usually for a vacation.  Here in Los Angeles, you can take a cruise down to Mexico - down to the Baja region of Mexico.  You can also take a cruise to Hawaii, which will take you a couple of days, and you go on a very large  ship.

 Well, this is a cruise not of Hawaii or down to Mexico; this was just a short cruise that Lucy and her friends went on.  I, apparently, was not invited, which is a little sad!

Lucy says that her friends and she “decided to do something a little di fferent this year.  Instead of going,” she says, “to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year’s Eve,” they “decided to take a harbor cruise instead.”  Normally on New Year’s Eve, which is the evening before New Year’s - the evening of December 31st - they go to a club, which would be a dance club - a place to dance to music - or they throw a party.  Notice the expression to throw, “throw,” a party, means to put on a party - to have a party at your house or your apartment.  But instead of doing those t hings, they “decided to take a harbor cruise.”

The harbor, “harbor,” is an area in the ocean that is next to the land.  Usually it has walls that are built to protect the boats and the ships.  So, it's the place where you can think of the boats and ships parking; it's sort of a parking lot on the water for ships and boats.

The harbor cruise then was a cruise on a boat around the harbor - around the other boats.  Usually those are short cruises; in this case, I believe it was “four hours long.”  The cruise  “included dinner, music, dancing, and a great view of the fireworks.”  The fireworks, “fireworks,” (always plural) are little things that you shoot up into the air and they explode and you see a light.  Fireworks are very common for many celebrations - big celebrations: the Fourth of July - and in some cities, there are fireworks on New Year's Eve.  In Los Angeles, there are places that have fireworks on New Year's Eve.

Lucy says that on the day of New Year's Eve, they “drove to the marina and were among the first to board the ship.”  The marina, “marina,” is a harbor that is built especially for smaller boats, and usually there are walkways - sort of wooden sidewalks - to walk out and get on the boat.  We have a very large marina here in Los Angeles calle d Marina del Rey - the Marina of the King - and the marina has fireworks, where they have fireworks out over the ocean or near the ocean.

Lucy says that she and her friends were “the first to board the ship.”  To board, “board,” means to get on a ship or an airplane.  You can also board a train or a bus.  Anything that carries a lot of people, we say that you board.  So, if you're at the airport and they say, “The flight will be boarding in ten minutes,” that means that people will be getting on the plane in ten minutes.  So, don't go and buy some coffee, you may miss your flight - you may not get on the plane in time!

 Lucy and her friends boarded the ship.  She says, “This was no little boat.”  “This was no” is another way of saying this was not a little boat.  This is a somewhat difficult expression, “this was no.”  It's used before an object - a noun - in a sentence without any articles - without any indefinite articles, like “a” or “and” or definite articles, like “the.”  You can say, “This was no littl e boat,” meaning this was not a little boat.  But, if you use the word “a” or “the,” you would have to say, “not.”  “This was no little boat,” “This was not a little boat,” notice the difference.

A boat, “boat,” is something that floats on the water.  It stays on top of the water and you can get into it and you can move across the water.  If it's a very large boat, we often call that a ship, “ship.”  So, Lucy says in the story here that “This was no little boat.  It was a large ship with an upper and a low er deck.”  The deck, “deck,” of a ship is the level - think of it as the floor of the ship, so there could be more than one level - more than one floor.  We also use that term if you are talking about a bus.  If the bus is what we would call a double decke r that means it has two decks.  These are, or were, popular in London; I'm not sure if they still are.  If you go to London, you can probably find a double decker bus - a bus with two decks.  The top deck is called the upper deck, and the bottom is called the lower deck.

Well, this is a large ship.  “The crew helped” Lucy and her friends “get on board.” The crew, “crew,” are the people who work on the boat - the staff of the boat or the ship.  To help someone get on board means to get inside the boat, or a plane or a train.  So, they helped them “get on board” - they helped them board would be the same meaning - “and showed us where the life jackets were.”

When you go on a ship, they usually have - in fact, they have to have, according to most state law s, some sort of life jacket.  A life jacket is usually just a vest, not an actual jacket; it is like a jacket with no sleeves for the arms, and it floats.  So, in case the boat has a problem and you have to go out into the water, even if you can't swim, if  you have a life jacket you can still survive - you can still float on top of the water.  So, they showed Lucy and her friends the life jackets in case there was an emergency.

“Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers.”  The captain, “captain,” is the person who is in charge of - who is the head of the ship; we call that person the captain.  So, “the captain came out,” meaning he went outside and greeted - said hello to the people who were getting on the boat; we would call those people the pass engers.  A passenger, “passenger,” is anyone who travels on a boat or a ship, an airplane, a train, a bus - any of those things, you can call the people passengers.

 You can even talk about a passenger in a car.  We often use the term “the passenger side, ” which in an American car would be on the right side of the car. In a car in Great Britain, it would be on the left side.

Lucy said she and her friends “had a great time.”  They “didn't get seasick.”  To get seasick, “seasick,” means to get sick because  of the motion of the water. The words sea, “sea,” is another word for an ocean - it's like an ocean.  So, seasick is getting sick, usually to your stomach.  You may even get a little dizzy if you are on the water.

Lucy jokes that they “didn’t have to ca ll out the Coast Guard, either.”  The Coast, “Coast,” Guard, “Guard,” is part of the United States military.  They are the people who protect the coasts of the United States, which are the part where the country is next to an ocean; that would be the coast .  Here in Los Angeles, we're on the West Coast; New York City is on the East Coast.

So, the Coast Guard was not called, meaning they didn't have any emergencies. She said that she and her friends “had so much fun, we didn’t want to go back on shore.”  T o go on shore, “shore,” means to leave the boat and go back on land.

“Finally,” Lucy says, “the captain joked that if” they “didn't leave” the ship, “he’d make” them “walk the plank!”  The expression to walk the plank is an old one that you sometimes see in movies about pirates - thieves - people who steal from other ships and boats.  A plank, “plank,” is a long piece of wood.  In the old days, especially in the movies, if you were somehow caught by the pirates - the thieves - you might be forced to walk o ut on a long piece of wood and, of course, jump off - you would have to die in the ocean.  So, the expression here by the captain is a joke, saying well, if you don't leave, I'll make you walk the plank, just like the pirates did.

If you've seen the famou s movie, “Pirates of the Caribbean,” we call it in English, with that really ugly actor - what's his name?  Johnny Depp, I think he calls himself - then you know what I'm talking about.  I'm just kidding, of course!

Now let's listen to the story, this tim e at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

My friends and I decided to do something a little different this year.  Instead of going to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year’s Eve, we decided to

 take a harbor cruise instead.  The cruise would  be four hours long, and it included dinner, music, dancing, and a great view of the fireworks.

On that day, we drove to the marina and we were among the first to board the ship.  This was no little boat.  It was a large ship with an upper and a lower d eck. The crew helped us get on board and showed us where the life jackets were in case of an emergency.  Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers.

We had a great time.  I didn’t get seasick as I’d feared, and we didn’t have to call out the C oast Guard, either.  We had so much fun, we didn’t want to go back on shore.  Finally, the captain joked that if we didn’t leave, he’d make us walk the plank!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 233 .  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our episode is called “Asking for a Date.”  Let's go!

[Start of story]

I admit it.  I’m a player.  I work in an office where there are a lot of attractive women.  Take Debra, for example.  I heard that she just broke u p with her boyfriend last week so I decided to ask her out.

Liam:  Hi, Debra.  How’s it going?

Debra:  Okay, I guess.  How about you?

Liam:  I’m doing okay.  You know, I’m going to an art show this Saturday.  Would you like to come with me?

Debra:  Gee z, I’m pretty busy this weekend.

Liam:  That’s too bad.  How about going for a drink after work today?

Debra:  Well, I don’t know...

Liam:  Come on.  It’ll be fun and we can try that new place down the street.

Debra:  I guess that’ll be okay, but jus t a drink, right?

Debra:  [laughs]  Okay, then.  I’ll see you after work.

I ask women out wherever I see them, even ones I’ve never met before.  At a restaurant, if I see a woman eati ng by herself, I usually say: “I just hate eating alone.  Do you mind if I join you?”  The other day, I saw a woman at the grocery store and tried my luck.

Liam:  Hi.

Monica:  Hi.

Liam:  I’ve just moved to this area and was wondering if you could reco mmend a good restaurant around here.

Monica:  That depends on what kind of food you like.  There’s a good Italian restaurant on Elm Street, or there’s a good Thai place on Lyndon Avenue.

Liam:  Which one do you prefer?

Monica:  I like them both, but I ’d probably go for the Italian place.

Liam:  In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime?

Monica:  I’m not sure.  I don’t even know you.

Liam:  You’re right, but you seem really nice and I’d like to get to know you better.  What do you  say?

Monica:  Well, maybe.  Here’s my number.  Call me and we’ll talk about it.

Liam:  I’ll do that.  I’m looking forward to talking with you again.

It’s as easy as that.  I don’t try to be a player.  All it takes is a little charm and a little flatter y, and women will find you irresistible.

Posting of these materials on anothe r website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  7 Our dialogue in this episode is all about dating, and we have a man, Liam and two different women, Debra and Monica.  We watch Liam try to get dates with these different women.

Liam begins by say ing, “I admit it.  I’m a player.”  To admit, “admit,” something means to say something is true even if you don't want to say it.  It's like confessing something.  Well, what Liam is confessing here is that he's “a player.” Player, “player,” is an informal  expression or informal word that means a man who dates a lot of women, usually at the same time, often without the other women knowing that you are dating more than one woman.  So, Liam says he's “a player,” just like me!

He says, “I work in an office wh ere there are a lot of attractive women.” Attractive, “attractive,” means pretty or good looking.  He says, “Take Debra, for example,” meaning let's start talking about Debra as an example.  He says, “I heard that she just broke up with her boyfriend.”  T o break up with someone means to end a romantic relationship - to stop a romantic relationship.  This happens here in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, all the time among celebrities and stars.  So, to break up with someone means to end your relationship.

Liam then starts talking to Debra, he says, “Hi, Debra.  How’s it going?”   She says, “Okay.”  What about you - “How about you?”   Liam says he's “doing okay.” He says he's “going to an art show” on Saturday.  An art show would be a show looking at pictures or paintings.  Of course, Liam is trying to impress Debra - make Debra think that he is a very cultured person.

He asks Debra if she would like to come with him, and Debra says, “Geez, I’m pretty busy this weekend.”  This is what the women always used t o tell me when I asked them out on a date!  The expression geez, “geez,” is one we use to express surprise, or perhaps confusion.  Well, Debra is perhaps a little surprised and she says that she's “busy this weekend.”

Then Liam, who, of course as a player , tries to get women to date him, goes on to say, “That’s too bad.  How about going for a drink after work today?”  To go for a drink means to go have an alcoholic beverage or a soda, maybe a beer, with someone in a bar.   And Debra says, “Well, I don’t kno w,” and Liam starts to try to convince her; he says, “Oh, come on.  It’ll be fun and we can try that new place down the street.”

Debra finally says, “I guess that’ll be okay, but just a drink, right,” meaning they're just going to have a drink, more or le ss as friends, nothing serious.

Posting of these materials on anothe r website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  8 Liam, lying of course, says, “That’s all and I promise I won’t even try to buy you dinner.”  To buy someone dinner - for a man to buy a woman dinner is usually a sign that he wants to date that woman.

Liam goes on to talk about how asks women out - he asks them to go on a date with him.  To ask someone out is to ask them to go on a date.  He says he asks them out whenever he sees them, even ones he's “never met before.”  He then goes on to say that when he's at a restaurant  and he sees “a woman eating by herself,” he'll say to her, “Do you mind if I join you,” meaning is it okay that I sit down with you - will it bother you?

He says, “The other day,” meaning in a recent day - recently, “I saw a woman at the grocery store an d I tried my luck.”  To try your luck at something is to do something even if you know it may not be successful - even if you know it may not work.  To try your luck - you hope you are successful.

Liam, of course, begins by simply saying, “Hi” to this wom an.  The woman, Monica, says, “Hi,” and then he, again, probably lying - probably not telling the truth - says, “ I’ve just moved to this area” - I've just moved to this part of the city - “and was wondering if you could recommend a good restaurant around here.”  Of course, what Liam is doing here, as all men know, is trying to start a conversation and trying to find an excuse to talk to this woman.

Monica says, “That depends on what kind of food you like.”  The expression that depends on, means that is de termined by or that would be influenced by someone or something else.  So, she's saying here, well, there may be good restaurants, but it depends on the restaurant - the kind of restaurant that you like. She then says, “There’s a good Italian restaurant,”  and there's also “a good Thai place.”  Thai, “Thai,” refers to Thailand - the country - and Thai food is very popular in many large cities, like Los Angeles

Liam says, “Which one do you prefer?”  Which one do you like?   And Monica says, “I like them both , but I’d probably go for the Italian place.”  To go for, here, means to choose or to select.  It also has other meanings, this expression, to go for.  If you look at the Learning Guide, you will see some additional meanings for this expression, but here i t means to select.

Liam, says, “In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime?”  Liam is what we would call very smooth.  To be smooth, “smooth,” if you're a man

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educational Development (200 7).  Posting of these materials on anothe r website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  9 means that you have a certain talent about getting women to go on dates with you, or to say the right thing so they will go on a date with you.

Monica says, “I’m not sure.  I don’t even know you.”  Remember, they're at a grocery store.   Liam says, “You’re right, but you seem really nice and I’d like to get to know you better,” meani ng I'd like to find out more about you.  “What do you say?”  What do you say here means what do you think - what is your decision?   Monica says, “Well, maybe.  Here’s my number.  Call me and we’ll talk about it.”  Here’s my number means here is my telephon e number.

Liam says, “I’ll do that.  I’m looking forward to talking to you again.”  He ends the story by saying that “It’s as easy as that,” meaning it's very simple; you just have to do what he did.  He says he doesn't “try to be a player.  All it takes, ” he says - all that is necessary - all that you need - “All it takes is a little charm and a little flattery, and the women will find you irresistible.”

A little charm, “charm,” means the power to attract other people - to make them feel comfortable.  If we say about a person, “He's very charming,” we mean that other people like him - he has a good way of relating to other people - talking to other people.  Flattery, “flattery,” are words that you use - things that you say to someone else to compliment them - to make them feel good about themselves.

What Liam is saying here is that if you have a little charm, and if you can give women some flattery, they “will find you irresistible.”  To be irresistible means that it is impossible for them to say no - for someone to deny.  If a person is irresistible, you mean that the women will have to say yes because they can't say no.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

# Seeing an Eye Doctor

Welcome to E nglish as a Second Language Podcast number 234: Seeing an Eye Doctor.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 234.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, Califor nia.

Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com to get the Learning Guide for this podcast.  It has all of the vocabulary, the definitions, additional sample sentences that use all of the new words that we explain in the podcast, it also has additional meanings of words, a culture note and a complete transcript of this episode.

Our topic today is “Seeing an Eye Doctor.”  Let's go!

[Start of story]

I’ve been getting a lot of headaches the past few weeks and my co -worker suggested I go see an optometri st.

Dr. Olho:  Okay, let’s take a look.  Do you wear glasses or contacts?

Virginia:  I used to, but I had laser eye surgery three years ago and I don’t wear them anymore.

Dr. Olho:  I see.  Well, let’s check your vision.  It may be that even though your vision was 20/20 after the surgery, it’s changed and you are now either near - sighted or far -sighted.  Cover your left eye and take a look at the eye chart. Read the last line that you can make out.

Virginia:  I can read the fourth line down – X, C, D, O, M, A.

Dr. Olho:  Hmmm...okay.  Cover your other eye and do the same.  Good.  I’m going to have you look through this machine and I want you to tell me if A or B is sharper and clearer.  Okay, A or B, A or B?

Virginia:  A is a little blurry.  I thin k B is better.

Dr. Olho:  Okay, I think that you’ve developed some far -sightedness and will need reading glasses.  I’m writing out a prescription for you.  When you’ve picked

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educati onal Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  6 out a frame, give them the prescription and they’ll make your lenses.  Any questions?

Virginia:  So, do you really think I need reading glasses?  I’m not that old.

Dr. Olho:  I’m sorry to say that you do.  Some people have to get them earlier than others.  At least you’re not having any serious eye problems like glaucoma.

Virginia:  Yeah, I guess that’s one thing to be grateful for.

[End of story]

Today, we take a trip to the eye doctor - to visit the person who will help us with our eyes.  I know I've been going to the eye doctor for many years.  I think I got my first pair  of glasses when I was about ten or 11 years old, so I have a lot of experience with eye doctors, maybe you do too.

In our dialogue today, the story begins by Virginia saying that she's “been getting a lot of headaches” in “the past few weeks,” and so she  decides to go see an optometrist.  An optometrist, “optometrist,” is a doctor for your eyes.  It's the doctor that you would normally go see if you were having problems with your eyes - an optometrist.

She says that she's having headaches she thinks that  might caused by her eyes, so she goes to see Dr. Olho, and Dr. Olho says, “Okay, let’s take a look” - let me look at you.  He asks Virginia if she wears “glasses or contacts.”  Glasses, “glasses,” is short for eyeglasses, and those are the things that you  wear to help you see better.

Some people have contacts instead of glasses.  Contacts, “contacts,” are little lenses - they are thin pieces of plastic that you put right on your eye.  I never liked the idea of contacts, but they are very popular for peo ple who don't want to wear glasses - people who would be more beautiful, perhaps, without glasses.  I would not be more beautiful without glasses, so it doesn't matter to me!

Virginia says that she used to wear glasses or contacts, but she “had laser eye surgery three years ago.”  Laser, “laser,” eye surgery is an operation - a medical procedure - where the doctor takes a laser beam and makes a small cut in your eye to help you see better.  This has become very popular in the last ten years or so in many c ountries.

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educati onal Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  7 Dr. Olho says okay, “let's check your vision.”  Vision, “vision,” is another word for sight, “sight,” which is another word for your ability to see - how well you can see. Sometimes we also use that word, vision, when we are talking about your plans for the future or your new ideas for the future.  “I have a vision for my company” - I know what we should be doing.  Here though, the word vision just means the ability for you to see - your sight.

Dr. Olho says that “It may be” - it's possible - “that your vision was 20/20 after the surgery,” but now, “it’s changed.”  The expression, 20/20, means perfect vision - the ability to see perfectly without any major problems.

Dr. Olho says that maybe now, Virginia is “near -sighted or far -sighted.”  To be near-sighted means that you can see things that are close to you but you can't see things that are far away from you.  To be far -sighted means that you can see things that are far away but you're not able to see things that are close to you - that are nea r you.  So, it's a little confusing.

The doctor tells Virginia to cover her left eye, meaning close it - make sure you cannot see out of it by putting your hand in front of it for example, “and take a look at the eye chart.”  The eye chart, “chart,” is a piece of paper - something on the wall that you look at to help the doctor determine what your problem is. Usually an eye chart has a bunch of letters.  These letters are usually very big on the top of the page, and then they become smaller and smaller.

Dr. Olho asks Virginia to “Read the last line that” she “can make out.”  To make out (two words) means to see clearly - to recognize or identify.  So, she needs to read the smallest line that she can understand - that she can read and see clearly.  Virgini a does that, and Dr. Olho says that he wants her to cover her other eye and do the same thing.

He then asks Virginia to look through a certain machine, and this machine is going to have different kinds of lenses in it.  A lens, “lens,” is usually a piec e of glass or plastic that helps you see better.  It's what you have in your eyeglasses; you have two lenses.  These lenses are sometimes put in a machine so the doctor can test to see which lens works best for you.

In this dialogue, Dr. Olho asks Virgini a “if A or B” - the lens A or the lens B - “is sharper and clearer” - which of them is sharper and clearer.  When we say something is sharp, “sharp,” we mean that it is very clear - you can see it very clearly.  The opposite of sharp would be blurry, “blur ry.”  Something that is blurry

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Educati onal Development (2006).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited.  8 is something that you can't see very well.  James says that “A is a little blurry,” and B is a little better, so that the B lens seems to be better for her.

Dr. Olho says that Virginia seems to have “developed some far -sight edness,” meaning that her eyes have become far -sighted - she can see far things but she can't see things that are close to her.  That's why he tells her that she needs to get reading glasses, and he writes a prescription for her.  A prescription, “prescrip tion,” is usually a piece of paper that the doctor gives you; sometimes it can be for a drug - some medicine, in this case it's for a new pair of glasses - some new eyeglasses.

He tells Virginia that after she has selected or picked out a frame, she shoul d give the prescription to the people working at the eyeglass store.  Usually we call those people opticians, “opticians.”  An optician is not a doctor; the doctor is called an optometrist.

So, Virginia is going to pick out a frame.  Frame, “frame,” is a piece of metal or plastic that holds the lenses.  So, it's the thing that keeps the glasses on your head and holds the lenses together.  Frame is a word that we have other meanings for in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for today for the explana tion of other meanings of the word frame, as well as the word contact.

Well, Virginia is not happy, and she asks if she really needs to have reading glasses.  She says, “I'm not that old.”  Well, I'm not that old either Virginia, but I have glasses!

Dr. Olho says, “I’m sorry to say that you do” - you do need glasses.  He says, “At least you’re not having any serious eye problems like glaucoma.”  Glaucoma, “glaucoma,” is a certain disease of the eye that can make someone blind. Virginia says, “Yeah, I gue ss that’s one thing to be grateful for.”  To be grateful, “grateful,” means to appreciate something - to be thankful that you have something good.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

I’ve been getting  a lot of headaches the past few weeks and my co -worker suggested I see an optometrist.

Dr. Olho:  I see.  Well, let’s check your vision.  It may be that even though your vision was 20/20 after the surgery, it’s changed and you are now either near - sighted or far -sighted.  Cover your left eye and take a look at the eye chart. Read the l ast line that you can make out.

Virginia:  A is a little blurry.  I think B is better.

Dr. Olho:  Okay, I think that you’ve developed some far -sightedness and will need reading glasses.  I’m writing out a prescription for you.  When you’ve p icked out a frame, give them the prescription and they’ll make your lenses.  Any questions?

# Parking Instructions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 235: Parking Instructions.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 235.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles in the State of California.    On this podcast, we're going to talk about “Parking Instructions,” what you do when someone is telling you where you should park your car.  Let's get started!  [Start of story]  I arrived for my meeting at the headquarters of Woon Enterprises and I stopped at the kiosk to ask for directions.  It’s a huge organization and the offices are located on a 30-acre compound, so it’s very hard to find your way around without some help.    Guard:  Good morning.    Edyta:  Good morning.  I’m here for a meeting with Mark Johnson.  Could you tell me how to get to the right building?  Guard:  Sure.  Take this road and follow the bend to the right.  When you see the fork in the road, take the road on your right.  Follow that to the parking structure.  You can’t miss it.  Edyta:  Okay, so when the road splits, I should veer right.  Guard:  That’s right.  Here’s a guest parking permit.  Make sure it’s visible on your dash at all times.  Drive past the lot and go into the parking structure.  You can park on any level and in any space that isn’t reserved.  The building right next to the structure is where Mark Johnson’s office is.  Edyta:  Thanks, I think I’ve got all that.    The guard raised the arm of the gate and let me through.  As I drove through the huge compound to the parking structure, I couldn’t help thinking that this Woon must be one very successful businessman. # An On-Site Estimate

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 236: An On-Site Estimate.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 236.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com and download the Learning Guide for this podcast.  Our podcast in this episode is about “An On-Site Estimate.”  This is when you have someone coming over to your house or to your office building and telling you how much they will charge you - how much you will have to pay to have changes or repairs on your building.  Let's get started.  [Start of story]  I work for a building contractor and I spend most of my workday giving on-site estimates.  I mainly go to people’s homes, discuss the work they want done, inspect the site, and give them a quote.    Robert:  You want to expand your kitchen, is that right?  Abigail:  Yes, with our growing family, we need more room.    Robert:  It looks like it’s about 200 square feet right now.  You want to double the size?  Abigail:  That’s the idea, but I want to get it done quickly, say within two months.  Is that possible?     Robert:  Well, we’ve finished jobs like this before in under three months, but that’s without any delays.  Sometimes getting the exact materials the client wants or finding structural problems that don’t appear until we start work can set us back.    Abigail:  That’s my greatest fear.  I’m afraid of delays and cost overruns.  Robert:  Well, we try to be upfront with our clients by giving them a breakdown of the costs of the materials and labor involved in the project.  We also give them a schedule of when the work will be completed.  You’ll get a detailed estimate in writing, at no charge and with no obligation. # Getting Revenge

Now let's get started.  [Start of story]  Jaime:  I don’t know what’s wrong with Liam lately.  The guy is short-tempered and jumps down my throat about every little thing.    Debra:  [laughs]  Jaime:  What’s so funny?  Debra:  I have a feeling that he’s not getting enough sleep.  Jaime:  You don’t mean you and Liam...  Debra:  No way!  It’s just that the women in this office are paying him back for the way he's treated them, two-timing them and leading them on.  Jaime:  Are you serious?    Debra:  Yeah, there are quite a few women with an axe to grind and wouldn’t mind getting even with him.  You’re not going to tell him, are you? # Traveling Off-Season

It’s off-season in a lot of popular places right now, so it may be doable.    Bill:  Maybe.  We’d have to find some pretty deep discounts.  There is a big advantage to traveling during the low season, though.  It’s a lot less crowded.    Kavita:  Yeah, I like that.  I’ll see if I can find a package deal that includes airfare and lodgings.  That may give us the best deal.       Bill:  We have one thing going for us.  We have flexible travel dates, which should make it easier to take advantage of any special promotions.  Kavita:  That’s true.  I’m start looking online and I’ll let you know what I find.  Bill:  I know what a good bargain hunter you are, so if anyone can find a good deal, it’s you. # A Birthday Party

Miranda:  Don’t get mad, but I actually told him that I didn’t mind.  I know I’ve been working long hours, but I don’t want to turn down the work.  You know that I’m getting paid time and a half, and we need the money.  Jeremy:  I know we do, but we’re getting by.  What happened to a 40-hour workweek?  You’ve been working at least 60.  It’s not worth it for you to work your fingers to the bone no matter how strapped we are.  Miranda:  I know.  I know.  It’s just that morale around this place is pretty low and I’m just trying to do my part.  Just don’t gripe.  Okay?  Jeremy:  I’m not griping.  I’m just worried about you.  You come home after a long day, and you’re overworked and emotionally drained.  That’s not fair to the kids. # At the Bakery

As you can see, we have a lot of different types of cookies, brownies, cakes, and muffins over here.  Leticia:  Ooh, that cake looks wonderful.  How many people does it serve?  Clerk:  This one?  It has three layers, and it serves between eight and ten people, depending on how you slice it.  If you like chocolate, you may like this one over here with the frosting and sprinkles.  Leticia:  Oh, that looks good, too.  Hmm.  It’s so hard to decide.  Why don’t I take the layer cake, and I’d like a dozen of these cookies, too.    Clerk:  Our cookies, muffins, and scones always come in baker’s dozens.  Can I get you anything else?  Leticia:  I think I’d like a bag of those biscotti, too.    Clerk:  Sure, no problem.

Our episode is called “The Comedy Club.”  Let's go!  > On Friday night, I went with a group of friends from work to a comedy club.  I don’t really like sketch comedy, but I do like stand-up, and the comedian who was going to perform there was one of my favorites.    There were six of us and we were a pretty rowdy group.  We stood in line outside, and when we got to the box office window, we paid the cover charge.  The hostess showed us to a table right next to the stage and told us that there was a two-drink minimum.  She took our drink orders and we waited for the opening act.  The first comic told a lot of political jokes and most of them fell flat.  In fact, some of the people seated in the back started to boo him and he got off the stage pretty quickly.  The MC came out and tried to get the hecklers to calm down by telling a few jokes of his own, and that did the trick.    The headliner finally came out and the crowd went crazy, clapping and cheering.  He did some very funny improv and had us rolling in the aisles.  I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard!
  Our episode is called “The Comedy Club.”  We use this word, club, in a couple of different ways.  When someone says, “I'm going to the club,” they could mean that they are going to a dance club, which is a place where you can dance, often # Speaking to a Store Clerk on the Phone

Ariel:  I’m trying to find the latest Reunion Island Ensemble CD.  Clerk:  I’m not sure we have that in stock.  We have a lot of CD’s on back order.  Can I put you on hold while I check?  Ariel:  Sure.  Clerk:  Okay.  We have one copy of their 2005 CD left.  Is that the one you’re looking for?  Ariel:  Yes, it is.  How much is it?     Clerk:  Let me check the price.  It’s $17.95.

Noriko:  Sure.  Shoot.  Walt:  Well, it’s not what I envisioned when we gave him the charge to come up with a new design for the brochure.  The cover isn’t bad, but I’m not crazy about the rest of it.    Noriko:  Why?  What don’t you like?  Walt:  Well, I think Russ is off the mark to feature our older products, rather than our new ones.  When I saw what he had come up with, I thought he was out in left field.  We told him to focus on the latest products, didn’t we?  Noriko:  Yes, we did tell him that.  I haven’t had a chance to look at the brochure closely myself, but I plan to this afternoon.  So you think it needs work, huh?  A lot of work?  Walt:  Let’s just say that there’s a lot of room for improvement.  I’d be happy to meet with him to give him my comments, if you think that would help. # Characteristics of an Ideal Mate

Tamara:  So, tell me what you’re looking for in a woman.  Rachid:  She has to be rich and hot!  Tamara:  Come on!  Be serious.  Rachid:  Okay, okay, but I don’t know why married people are always trying to get their single friends married off.  Is it because misery loves company?    Tamara:  Stop being a smart aleck and answer the question.  Rachid:  All right.  I’m being serious now.  What do I look for in a woman?  I’d like someone who has a good sense of humor, someone who is kind-hearted and easy to talk to, and is supportive of me.    Tamara:  What about vital statistics?  Age, physical type? # Understanding Addresses

Which ones?  Christina:  I need addresses for Jim Kelly and for Dr. Uemura.    Jacob:  Okay.  Jim Kelly’s address is...  Christina:  I’m sorry Jacob, but my cell phone cut out and I didn’t hear you.  Could you repeat the street address?  Jacob:  Sure.  It’s 1212 South Peabody Court, Lansing, Michigan, 48908.  Christina:  I didn’t catch the end of the address.  Did you say boulevard, avenue, or street?     Jacob:  It’s actually court, and the street number again is 1212.  Christina:  Thanks.  I’ve got that.  Could you also spell the street name? # Asking for Recommendations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 247: Asking for Recommendations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  247.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii - no, just kidding!  In beautiful Los Angeles, California, but Honolulu is very beautiful, too!

This podcast is going to be about “Asking for Recom mendations,” when you want someone to help you, and you're asking for their op inion or their advice about something.  In this particular dialogue Victor is g oing to be talking with someone at a hotel - a person who works for the hotel - to try to get some recommendations about things in that area.  Let's g et started > Hotel Clerk:  Can I help you with something?
> Victor:  Yes, I was hoping you could recommend a re staurant nearby.
> Clerk:  What kind of food would you like?
> Victor:  I’m not picky.  I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.
> Clerk:  There’s a good seafood restaurant called “G aleno’s” about two blocks away.  Would you like me to make a reservation for you?
> Victor:  Thanks, but that won’t be necessary.  I ne ed to check with my guest before deciding.  By the way, I’ll be in town for f our days, and I’d like to see the sights.
> Clerk:  Is this your first time here?
> Victor:  Yes, it is.
> Clerk:  Then, I’d suggest seeing our museums and the botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.
> Victor:  Can I get there on foot?
> Our episode begins with the hotel clerk asking Vict or, “Can I help you with something?”  That would be a very polite, standard thing that an employee of a company, such as a hotel or a store, might ask you when they are asking if you need some help - “Can I help you with something?”  Or, they may say, “Do you need some help?”

Victor says, “Yes, I was hoping you could recommend  a restaurant nearby.” There's another polite expression - “I was hoping” - “I was hoping you could help me.”  The use of the “I was hoping” is, again, a li ttle more polite.  You're not demanding - you're not saying you must help me, you 're saying I was hoping that you would be able to help me.

The clerk asks what kind of food Victor likes, beca use he's asking for a restaurant recommendation.  Victor says, “I’m not p icky,” “picky.”  To be picky means to be very selective - difficult to please.  Children are sometimes picky about the kind of food that they will eat.  When I was young, if you were picky, you just didn't eat anything because my brothers an d sisters would eat whatever food you didn't want.

Victor says, “I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.”  The phrase moderately, “moderately,” me ans not too expensive.  Not necessarily something with a very low price, but no t something that is very expensive - something in between - moderately.  So,  he wants a restaurant that is not too expensive but still pretty good, in term s of the quality, and he wants something “that's within walking distance.”

Walking distance is the distance you can walk, usua lly a person means within 15, 20, maybe 25 minutes of walking.  It depends on who  you are and how far you

want to walk, but I would say that if you were at a  hotel and you asked for a restaurant within walking distance, you're looking for something within 10, 15, maybe 20 minutes from your hotel.  You could also s ay how many blocks it is from your location, but even though the expression is walking distance, we usually give the person the amount of time it would  take for the average person to walk.  So, perhaps we should say, “walking time, ” but we don't.

The clerk says, “There’s a good seafood restaurant called 'Galeno’s' about two blocks away.  Would you like me to make a reservati on for you?”  To make a reservation means to call the restaurant and to say , “I am going to becoming and eating there.”  Usually you tell them how many peop le there will be and the time that you will be coming.

Victor says, “Thanks, but that won’t be necessary.  I need to check with my guest before deciding.”  To check with someone means that  you need to ask someone's opinion before deciding what to do.  If y ou're married and you’re a man, you know that you can't do anything important unless you check with your wife.  I know that's true in my life!

So, Victor is going to check with his guest - the p erson he is with - before he decides.  To check with actually has a couple of di fferent meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide today for some additional def initions.

Victory then says, “By the way, I’ll be in town for  four days, and I’d like to see the sights.”  The expression by, “by,” the way, “way,” is used when you want to say something or ask something that isn't necessarily c onnected or related to what you just said.  So, it's a way of changing the topi c in a conversation.

Victor is answering the clerk by telling him that h e needs “to check with his guest before deciding,” then he thinks of something else he wants to ask the clerk that is not related, so uses the expression by the way.  “By the way, I'll be in town,” meaning I'll be here, in this city “for four days, and I’d like to see the sights.”  To see the sights, “sights,” means to see the importan t or interesting places in the city - the places that someone who is visiting the city would want to see.  So, if you go to Paris, you would want to see the Eiffel T ower.  If you come to Los Angeles, you would want to see Hollywood, and of co urse, the Center for Educational Development!

Victor says that he's going to be in town for four days, and the clerk asks, “Is this your first time here” - the first time you visited this city.

Victor says, “Yes.”  The clerk then says, “Then, I’ d suggest seeing our museums and botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.”  A museum, “museum,” is a place where you can see famo us art.  You could also see some historical information - some historical o bjects - in a museum.  You can have an art museum; you can have a history museum a nd so forth.  Famous museums include, here in Los Angeles, the Getty Mus eum, as well as, in New York, the Metropolitan Museum.  Those are two art m useums.

Botanical gardens, “botanical,” are places where yo u find flowers and trees; usually a very large area that has many different i nteresting plants.  Here in Los Angeles, we have the Huntington Gardens.  These are  botanical gardens that you can go and visit, that have different kinds of plants and trees.

The clerk also recommends that Victor visit the sho pping district.  The expression she uses is “don't miss.”  If someone says to you, “Don't miss this,” they mean you must do this - this is very important - you mus t go here - I strongly recommend that you see or do this thing.  You can s ay, “Don't miss the movie, 'LA Story,' by Steve Martin; it's a very funny movi e.”  That is an example of using that expression - you really should see it, I stron gly recommend it.

The shopping district, “district,” is an area in the city where there are many stores.  Most big cities have several different sho pping districts.  Victor says, “Can I get there on foot?”  The expression on foot is the same as by walking. Can I walk there?  There are a couple of meanings, again, of this expression, on foot; take a look at the Learning Guide for more in formation about those other definitions.

The clerk says no, but he says it in a polite way, he says, “I’m afraid not.”  When you want to say no to someone, but you want to be p olite, this is a good way to do that - “I'm afraid not.”

He says, “You can take a taxi or a bus,” that the c ity has, “a very good bus system.”  The bus, “bus,” system is the system of p ublic transportation in a city that uses buses.  You can have a subway system; you  can have a bus system. Both these are ways of getting around the city.

“The other option,” the clerk says, “is to take a t our.  There are several tour companies that have day tours leaving from this hot el.”  These are companies that come with their own bus and pick you up at you r hotel and take you to the important sights in the city.  A day, “day,” tour i s usually a short tour - four, five, maybe eight or nine hours that you go with a group of other tourists, and you

have a person that explains all the different place s you are going, we would call that person a tour guide.

The clerk says, “Help yourself to their brochures.”   He's talking about the brochures or printed information about these tour c ompanies.  The expression, help yourself, means go ahead and take whatever you  want.

Victor then asks if the clerk has a map.  The clerk  does, and gives him one, and Victor thanks him.  He says, “You’ve been a big hel p.”  That's another way of saying you have helped me a lot.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of story]

Hotel Clerk:  Can I help you with something?

Victor:  Yes, I was hoping you could recommend a re staurant nearby.

Clerk:  What kind of food would you like?

Victor:  I’m not picky.  I’m looking for something moderately priced that’s within walking distance.

Clerk:  There’s a good seafood restaurant called “G aleno’s” about two blocks away.  Would you like me to make a reservation for you?

Victor:  Thanks, but that won’t be necessary.  I ne ed to check with my guest before deciding.  By the way, I’ll be in town for f our days, and I’d like to see the sights.

Clerk:  Is this your first time here?

Victor:  Yes, it is.

Clerk:  Then, I’d suggest seeing our museums and the botanical gardens, and don’t miss the shopping district near downtown.

Victor:  Can I get there on foot?

Clerk:  I’m afraid not.  You can take a taxi or a b us.  We have a very good bus system.  The other option is to take a tour.  There  are several tour companies

 that have day tours leaving from this hotel.  Help yourself to their brochures. They’re over there.

Victor:  Do you have a map showing where those sigh ts are?

Clerk:  Sure.  Here you are.  Is there anything els e I can help you with?

Victor:  No, that’s all.  You’ve been a big help.  Thanks.

# Business Websites

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 248: Business Websites.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode number 248.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  On this episode, we're going to talk about vocabulary related to websites and setting up a business website.  As usual, first we'll listen to the dialogue at a slow speed, then the explanations, and finally, listen to the dialogue again at a normal rate of speech.  Let's get started.  > I was hired to set up a website for a small bookstore and the owner knew very little about the Internet.  I tried to find out what she wanted for her business website.  Octavio:  Let me show you some websites I’ve designed.  I have them all bookmarked.  Okay, this is a website for a restaurant.  As you can see, the homepage is fairly simple.  The menu bar on the left-hand side allows visitors to navigate around the site.  Margaret:  I like this layout a lot.  Why are these words in a different color?  Octavio:  Those are hyperlinks to other pages on the website.  If you click on the text or the image, you’ll be taken to a different page.    Margaret:  Oh, I see, so for my site, I can list the books I have for sale, and we can hyperlink each book title to a description of that book.  Octavio:  Yes, that’s right.  You’ll probably also want a search function so that people can type in the name of a book or the author to find out if you carry a specific book.    Margaret:  Yes, definitely.  Does it matter which browser customers use to look at my website?  Octavio:  No, I’ll make sure that it’s compatible with all of the major browsers out there. # At a Casino

It’s not the jackpot, but now I’ve broken even.    Tad:  That’s really great.  Maybe some of your luck will rub off on me.  I’m just about to see what the high rollers are doing.  Do you want to come with me to check out the blackjack tables or roulette?  Hanna:  I’m not that good at those high-stakes games, where people bet hundreds of dollars on a single play!  I’d like to get the comps they get, but I don’t have that kind of money to gamble with.    Tad:  Yeah, I wish I had somebody rich to bankroll me, too.    Hanna:  I’ll just come and watch you play.  You know, I wish I knew how to count cards.  Then, I might try my hand at poker.    Tad:  Don’t even think about counting cards.  If you get caught, you’d get kicked out of this casino in a minute.  Hey, there’s a poker tournament going on over there.  I want to go watch that later.  But first, I want to get my hands on some chips or some dice.  I’m feeling lucky.  Hanna:  Let’s go.

Elena:  I got a “D” on the last test and I have to do better on this one.  If I don’t get at least a “B,” I’m going to flunk this class.    Oscar:  You’re taking a big risk.  You could get suspended or expelled!  Elena:  I know, but my final grade is on the line.  And plus, I think that the worst that could happen is that I get an automatic “F” on the test.  It’s not like I’m stealing a copy of the test or plagiarizing on an important assignment.  Oscar:  Still, there’s no telling what Mr. McQuillan will do to you if he finds out.  I’d let you copy off my test if I thought we could get away with it, but he always keeps a close eye on us during tests.  That’s why I think you’re going to get caught. # Stranger on an Airplane

Fay:  Thanks.  Dustin:  Are you traveling on business?  Fay:  Yes, I am.  I’m changing planes in Denver on my way to South Carolina, and then I’m off to Georgia on Wednesday.  There’s no rest for the wicked.    Dustin:  That’s a lot of traveling.  Doesn’t your husband or boyfriend mind?  Fay:  Oh, I’m not married or seeing anyone.  How about you?  Where are you headed?  Dustin:  I’m going to Jacksonville, Florida to visit my parents for a few days, but I’ll be back in Los Angeles by next weekend.  Are you from L.A. originally?  Fay:  No, I was born and raised in Kentucky, but I’ve been living in L.A. for the past four years.  What part of L.A. do you live in?  Dustin:  I live not too far from the airport in Westchester.  Have you heard of it? # A Workers Strike

This episode is called “A Workers Strike.”  We're going to hear a conversation between Masako and Salvador talking about whether they should have a strike at their workplace.  A strike is when the workers refuse to work in order to get more money or other benefits.  Let's get started.  > Masako:  I think we should strike.  We need to force management to listen to our grievances.  Salvador:  Hold on.  I think you’re being too hasty.  It’s up to our union to call a strike, not the workers.  Masako:  I’m not suggesting a formal strike, but we could organize a sickout.  That would send a message that we mean business.  Salvador:  Yeah, but that may also get their backs up.  We need to give collective bargaining a chance to get us the contract we want.    Masako:  The union has been negotiating for two months and things have stalled.  We need to do something to put pressure on the company to come to our terms.  At the very least, we should picket outside the building.    Salvador:  We should only do that if there’s a strike.  We don’t want to make employees feel like they’re crossing the picket line every time they come to work.  That would be bad for morale.  Masako:  Nobody’s going to feel like a scab if they all know why we’re picketing.  Let’s call a meeting and see what everyone else thinks. # Traveling by Train

This episode is called “Traveling by Train.”  It's a conversation between two people talking about train travel in the United States, and some of the vocabulary you need when you take a train.  Let's get going!  > Katerina:  Hey, Joel.  Have you ever traveled by train?  Joel:  Only once, and that was a long time ago when I lived in Orlando.  I’m not even sure where the train station is in this city.  Why do you ask?  Katerina:  I need to go to San Francisco at the end of May for a friend’s wedding, and I’m thinking about taking a train instead of flying.    Joel:  That’s a long trip from Chicago, with a lot of stops.  How many days does it take to get there?     Katerina:  I just printed out the timetable.  Let me see...It looks like it’ll take about four-and-a-half days.  I would depart, say, on Tuesday morning and arrive on Saturday afternoon.  Joel:  Can I see that?  It looks like there are good on-board services, with a dining car and a lounge car on each train.  Katerina:  Yeah, I like that.  I don’t know if I should go coach or business class.  I suppose that’ll depend on the fare.  I’ve heard that the sleeping cars are pretty comfortable, too, so I’m glad about that.    Joel:  What day of the week do you have to leave? # Good Hygiene

I was going to invite you to lunch, but you weren’t at your desk.  Bill:  I was at a training.  Juanita:  What was it on?  Bill:  Office hygiene.  Juanita:  Hygiene?  You’re kidding.  Your office is pretty messy but I wouldn’t say you needed hygiene training.  Bill:  Very funny.  Each department has to go through it.  You’ll have your turn next week.  Apparently, the management wants to reduce the spread of illnesses around the office.  They say that people are taking too many sick days and it’s bad for productivity.  Juanita:  So, we all have to sit through a training.  What a pain!  It’s not like we don’t know how to wash our hands.  Bill:  Yeah, I know.  The trainer did a pretty good job, though, explaining how germs spread around the office.  It’s easy to infect other people when you have a cold or something else that’s contagious.  She said that viruses get around pretty easily.  She gave us some pointers on how to prevent it, though. # Questions About a Product

Paul:  What I’m wondering is whether this machine can be used as a copier as well as a printer.  Clerk:  Yeah, it can.  This is a multifunction machine.  It can be used as a printer, copier, and a fax machine.    Paul:  Can you show me how that works?    Clerk:  Well, it’s pretty straightforward.  Just hook it up to your computer and you can use it like any other printer.  If you want to make copies, just put the document on the glass or in the feeder and press this button.     Paul:  That seems pretty simple.  How do I use it as a fax machine?    Clerk:  Just put the document in the feeder like you would for copying, but instead of pushing the “copy” button, press the “fax” button.  Make sure it’s hooked up to a phone line, of course.  Paul:  Okay.  I think I’ve got it.  Does this model come with a warranty? # Looking for Ideas

Sam:  What’s the matter?  Ling:  I’m trying to jot down some ideas for the meeting tomorrow but I’m drawing a blank.    Sam:  When I’ve got a block, I usually step away from it for a while and come back to it later.  Then I can look at it with a fresh perspective.    Ling:  I don’t have time to take a break.  I need to come up with something quick or I’ll have to go into that meeting empty-handed.  I can’t let Danielle show me up again.  At the last meeting, all of the department heads loved her ideas and they’re starting to think she walks on water.    Sam:  Well, I don’t think it helps to sit around worrying about it.  Nothing will come to you if you work yourself up too much.    Ling:  You’re right.  I’m too wound up to think straight.  It’s like my brain is in a fog.    Sam:  Come on.  We’ll go take a quick walk.  I’m sure that’ll do the trick.  If it doesn’t, I’ll help you work on your resume. # Finding a Book at a Bookstore

Adrian:  I’m not sure.  I think hardbacks.  Clerk:  Well, the non-fiction new releases are at the front of the store.  The non-fiction section is behind the fiction shelves on your right.  The hardbacks are on the top shelves and the paperbacks on the bottom ones.  Is there a specific book I can help you find?  Adrian:  I’m looking for an old book and I’m not sure of the title.  It’s something like, “The Literary Crisis.”  Clerk:  Do you know the name of the author?    Adrian:  No, I don’t.  I saw it mentioned online and I actually wrote down the ISBN, but I can’t find it now. # Moving in Together

Simon:  I have something I want to talk to you about.  Can you come over here and sit down for a minute?  Paula:  Uh oh.  Is something wrong?  Simon:  No, nothing’s wrong.  In fact, everything’s right.  We’ve been together for a year and I’ve been happier than I’ve ever been.  Paula:  Me, too.  Things are going great.  What is this all about?  Simon:  I want us to move things to the next level.  I want us to move in together.    Paula:  Simon, I love you, but we can’t do that.  You know how conservative my parents are.  They would never approve.    Simon:  They like me, don’t they?  Paula:  It’s not a matter of whether they like you or not.  They both adore you as much as I do.  But two people moving in together before they’re married goes against their beliefs and mine.  Simon:  But don’t you want to? # Making a Restaurant Reservation

Let me repeat back to you the information I have.  This is a reservation for the Friday after next for seven at seven p.m.  Is that correct?  Randy:  Yes, that’s right.  Can we have a table by the window in a non-smoking section?  I want to be away from the kitchen, if possible. # Business Trends

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 260: Business Trends.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 260.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.    Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com for more information about this podcast and to download the Learning Guide for this episode.  Our episode is called “Business Trends.”  Let's get started.  > Today, I’m going to be giving you a brief overview of the trends that are likely to affect our industry in the next ten years.  It’s difficult to predict the fads that affect how the general public thinks and behaves.  However, by looking at recent polls, we have a good idea about one area that is likely to have a dramatic influence on the way we do business down the line.     The trend that I’m talking about is the environment.  The biggest concern right now across major business industries here and in other parts of the world is about how “going green” will affect company outlook.  The growth of environmentally-friendly products has been off the charts in the past five years, and this trend is likely to continue for at least ten more years.    If you’ll look at this chart here, you’ll see what the major trend reports are forecasting.  It’s my opinion that it’s time we sat up and took notice.
  Our story today is called “Business Trends.”  A trend, “trend,” is something that changes in one direction over time, so it is something that goes up or goes down.  The trend for the price of gasoline in the United States has been going up - the way things are moving, either up or down.  The story begins by saying that “Today, I’m going to be giving you a brief overview of the trends that are likely to affect our industry in the next ten years.”  An overview, “overview,” is a general description of something, not giving a lot of detail but just giving you the general points about something.  In this case it's an # Describing People¡¦s Personalities

This episode is called “Describing People’s Personalities.”  It's going to be a dialogue between two people talking about the personality of their children, as well as themselves.  Let's get started.  > Joann:  Oh, are those pictures of your kids?  Artem:  Yes.  These are my three daughters and these are my two sons.    Joann:  Your sons look so alike.  Are they similar in personality, too?    Artem:  It’s funny you ask that.  My wife and I are always saying how different they are from one another, even though they’re the closest in age.  Sergey, the younger one, is moody and a little timid, while his older brother, Dennis, is talkative and cheerful all the time.    Joann:  That’s really interesting.  You know, I have an older sister and we’re only a year apart, but we have very different personalities, too.  When I was little, I was bad-tempered and I always fought with my brothers and sisters, while my sister was a little angel.  She was always patient and generous.  I really looked up to her.    Artem:  It’s hard for me to believe that you were ever bad-tempered.  You’re so even-keeled now.  Me, on the other hand, I was a selfish and stubborn kid.  I’m surprised that my parents put up with me.    Joann:  I’m sure you’re exaggerating.  All kids are a little selfish and stubborn, I think.  Good thing most of us grow out of it as we get older. # Missing the Tour Group Bus

Let's get started.  > Kelly:  Where is everybody?  Man:  Excuse me?  Were you talking to me?  Kelly:  Oh, no.  I was just talking to myself.  Our tour group was supposed to rendezvous here at five o’clock for our return trip to the hotel.  But there’s no trace of the bus and I don’t see any other people from my group anywhere.  Man:  You know, it’s 5:10.  Maybe the bus took off already.    Kelly:  That can’t be!  Our tour guide said that we would meet back here at five-ish.  She didn’t say precisely at five.    Man:  Maybe that’s what she meant.  You know, tour guides usually stick pretty closely to a time schedule.    Kelly:  Yes, I know, but what am I supposed to do now?  I don’t have any way to get back to the hotel.  Man:  Do you have the number of the tour company?  I could lend you my cell phone to call them.  Kelly:  Let me see.  No, I don’t.  I feel like such an idiot! # Getting Older

In this episode, we're going to listen to a dialogue between two people, talking about what it is like to get older—something I think about everyday!  Let's get started.  > Angelica:  Oh sorry, what was I saying?  I lost my train of thought.  Yann:  You were telling me about the book you’re reading.    Angelica:  Oh, yeah.  I must have had one of those senior moments.    Yann:  Welcome to the club.  That’s what happens when you’re over-the-hill like we are.  Angelica:  We’re not over the hill!  You may be an old geezer, but I still like to think of myself as middle-aged.  Isn’t 70 the new 60?  Yann:  That’s what they say, but I don’t mind aging.  I may be a little absent-minded now and then, but I’m not senile.  What I can’t stand is being treated like I am.  The other day, I sat at a table at a restaurant for 20 minutes while the waitress ignored me.  She waited on all of the tables around me first, and when she finally came to take my order, she didn’t even apologize.    Angelica:  Ageism is everywhere.  What I hate is to be talked to like I’m a child.  Some people think that if you’ve got gray hair, you’re not all there.  I’m as sharp as ever.    Yann:  I know, but do you know what we’re doing? # Preparing for a Video Conference

Let's get started.  > Emiliano:  I’m not sure about this video conference today.  It’s the next best thing to having a meeting face-to-face, but I’ve never used most of this equipment before.  Fatima:  It’s a piece of cake.  Do you want to do a run-through with me?   Emiliano:  Do you mind?  I’d really like to make sure that I know how to work this webcam and microphone.    Fatima:  I don’t mind at all.  Okay, we have Internet connectivity, so streaming won’t be a problem.  The speakers on both computers are turned up.    Emiliano:  Do you know how to adjust this webcam?  Right now, it’s focused on my right ear!    Fatima:  That’s easy.  Just use these buttons to zoom in or out, and you can tilt up or down.    Emiliano:  Oh, I see.  That’s better.  Now you can see my entire face.  Are you getting audio on your side?    Fatima:  Yes, you’re coming in loud and clear.  I think we’re in business.    Emiliano:  Well, that wasn’t so hard.  Let’s hope it goes this smoothly this afternoon.  Fatima:  If you have a problem, just give me a call. # Listening to the Radio

Gloria:  No way!  I’m listening to a simulcast of a performance and it’s live.    Kurt:  Is it on campus radio?  Gloria:  No, it’s on the public radio station.  I finally got good reception after putting this long antenna outside my window and I’m not turning it off now.  Kurt:  You are so low-tech.  I can’t believe you’re still listening to AM/FM radio.  You should get satellite radio.  You get shows in hundreds of formats, and there are a lot of stations without DJs.  And there’s never any static!  Gloria:  I like listening to the regular broadcast radio.  I don’t have to pay for it and I’m happy with the stations we have in this city.  You’re just a technology snob.  If it’s high-tech, you love it and have to have it.  Kurt:  It’s true that I know quality when I see it, and I don’t settle for less.  What’s wrong with that?  Gloria:  Nothing, but I don’t have to jump on the bandwagon.  Now, be quiet.  I’m trying to listen.  Kurt:  Fine.  This is the thanks I get for trying to give you a little good advice. # Making a Move on Someone

Let's get started.  > A.J.:  What was going on with you and Tiago in his office earlier today?  You two were pretty cozy in there.  Gloria:  What?  Oh, I was a little upset about messing up my presentation in the morning meeting, and Tiago was trying to reassure me about it.  A.J.:  It looked like he was doing more than comforting you.  He was sitting really close to you and he had his hand on your shoulder.  If you ask me, he was making a move on you.  Gloria:  Don’t be ridiculous!  Tiago and I are just friends.    A.J.:  Would you notice if he was?  Remember Paul?  He hit on you for two weeks before you noticed.  Gloria:  That was completely different.  He wasn’t hitting on me.  He was bothering me, and I actually had to file a sexual harassment complaint against him before he’d stop.  You’re comparing apples and oranges.  A.J.:  I’m just saying that you’re not the most observant person when it comes to these kinds of things.  Mark my words.  Tiago is interested in you.  Gloria:  If he is, I’m flattered.  He’s a very attractive guy. # Getting a Traffic Ticket

You were going 70 in a 55 mile an hour zone.    Ray:  I was?  No, I didn’t know.  Officer:  You also ran a red light and your brake light is out.  I see that your tags have also expired.  I’m going to have to cite you for all of that.  Ray:  I’m sure I didn’t run a red light, and I didn’t know my brake light wasn’t working.  I just renewed my registration and I’m still waiting for my new tags to arrive in the mail.  Is there any way I can get away with just a warning?    Officer:  I’m afraid not.    Ray:  What’s the fine for all of those violations? # Get-Rich-Quick Schemes

Bill:  Are you watching an infomercial?  Those things are scams!  You should know better than to fall for some get-rich-quick scheme.    Susan:  This isn’t a scam.  This program is about how make money with no capital.  All I have to do is to get other people to sell these products and I’ll get a cut of the profits.  Bill:  That sounds like a pyramid scheme.  Only a few people at the top make money, while all of the other people lose their shirts.    Susan:  It doesn’t seem like a fraud to me.  Sit down and watch for a minute and you’ll see all of the testimonials from people who have used this system and who have struck it rich.  It may really work.  Bill:  There’s a sucker born every minute.  How much do you have to pay to learn the secrets to this system? # Health Insurance Plans

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 269: Health Insurance Plans.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 269.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Check out our website at eslpod.com, and take a look at the Premium Courses we have in our ESL Podcast Store.  This episode is called “Health Insurance Plans.”  In the United States, as you may know, most people have private health insurance; there is no national health insurance.  This story is about the kinds of health insurance plans that you can have, and the problems that sometimes happen when you have to use the hospital or go to a doctor.  Let's get started!  > At my company, I have a choice of health insurance plans.  We can pick between HMOs and PPOs, and I have been with the same managed health plan for the past few years.  It’s the plan that has the lowest co-pays and the best coverage, and the network of doctors is fairly large.  The drug coverage is good and the affiliated hospital is close to my house.  Unfortunately, I’m discovering that it’s also the plan with the largest bureaucracy and patients can easily get lost in the shuffle.    I have a primary care physician, but like other plans, if I want to see a specialist, I must be referred by my primary care physician.  I've been trying to see an eye specialist for a few weeks.  I called my doctor’s office for a referral, but the nurse told me that I needed to first make an office visit.  I tried to get an appointment, but there weren’t any openings for five weeks!  I tried to leave a phone message for my doctor to talk to her about my situation, but she never returned my call.  I tried several more times, and still received no response.    I finally decided to file a grievance.  I know that I have patient rights, and that if I didn’t feel I was being treated fairly, I could file a complaint.  I just hope that filing the grievance will get me a resolution to this problem.  I’d like to see an eye specialist before I go blind!

The departure gate has been changed.  The flight will now be leaving from Gate 26.”  That was my flight!  I looked at the flight information monitors, turned around, and walked in the opposite direction.  As I was approaching Gate 26, there was another announcement:  “This is an announcement for passengers on flight 232 to Boise.  The flight has been delayed due to bad weather conditions.  The flight crew has arrived at the gate, but the ground crew is still de-icing the wings of the aircraft.  Our new departure time is 10:50 a.m.”    I thought the gate agent was done, but she had another announcement to make:  “I’m afraid that flight 232 is overbooked.  We’re looking for passengers who are willing to take a later flight in exchange for a travel voucher worth $300.  Any passenger who is interested should see an agent at Gate 26.” # Using an ATM

It's a machine where you get money out of by putting a bankcard in.  We'll be listening to a dialogue between Robin and someone who works at the bank about using the ATM card and some problems you sometimes have.  Let's get started.  > I went to bank this morning.  Instead of standing in line to talk to a bank teller, I decided to use an ATM, but it wasn’t working.  Robin:  Excuse me.  Could you help me?  I’m trying to use this ATM machine, but it stopped working after I put in my PIN and it won’t give me back my ATM card.  Bank clerk:  It looks like the machine is jammed.  Step over to this teller window and I can help you.  What transactions are you trying to make?  Robin:  I want to make a deposit, transfer some money between my checking and savings accounts, and make a cash withdrawal.    Bank clerk:  I can make those transactions for you.    Robin:  Okay.  Let me take this check out of the deposit envelope.  And what about my card?    Bank clerk:  I’ll call the technician and she should be able to retrieve it for you.  Robin:  Thanks a lot.  I guess that the machine just doesn’t like me. # Time Management

Let's get started.  > Ruby:  I’m snowed under with work!  I can’t seem to keep up with everything I have to do.  You’re always so organized and efficient.  How do you do it?  Ian:  I’m not always organized and efficient, but I’ve gotten better since I read a book about time management.  I use a few tools that the book recommends, which help me to plan and to keep track of deadlines.    Ruby:  Do you think it would help me?  Ian:  Definitely.  This is what I do.  I keep a to-do list of all of the things I need to do.  Then, I decide which tasks are high-priority and which have low-priority.  I write down the deadline I’m given for the task or I assign a deadline of my own, and I make a note of the most urgent tasks.    Ruby:  That seems pretty simple, but how do I keep track of the progress I make on a task?  Sometimes things just slip through the cracks for me.    Ian:  I do a couple of things.  First, I keep my list updated.  I check off or cross off those that I’ve done.  I also put reminders for myself on my computer to help me with scheduling.  It helps me to remember my appointments and to allocate my time better. # Telling Secrets to Parents

You wouldn’t tell on me and I’d take you and Kathy to the movies this weekend.  You’re such a tattletale.  Stephen:  I swear it wasn’t me!  Why would I tell?  We do have a deal and I’ve held up my end.    Therese:  Forget it.  The deal is off.  There’ll be no movie this weekend.    Stephen:  Hey, I told you it wasn’t me who spilled the beans.  Are you sure it wasn’t Jeffrey?  Therese:  Don’t try to put the blame on somebody else.  I know it was you.  Stephen:  How?  Therese:  You’re a terrible liar.    Stephen:  Well, if I did tell on you, I didn’t mean to do it.  Come on, please!  I really want to see that movie this weekend.  What can I do? # Buying Stamps at the Post Office

Clerk:  The current rate for sending a first-class letter is 41 cents.  With first-class service, your letter will get there in three to seven days for domestic mail.    Tamika:  For the first-class stamps, how many come in a book or a roll?  Clerk:  There are 20 in a book and 100 in a roll.  To send a Priority Mail envelope, you can get $4.05 stamps, and delivery is usually in two to three days.  How many would you like of each?    Tamika:  I’ll take one book of the stamps and four Priority Mail stamps.  Can I buy stamps to send an Express Mail envelope, too?  Clerk:  You can.  Those are $14.40 each.  Tamika:  Could you add one of those, too?  And how much is it to send a postcard?  I don’t need any stamps for those today, but I’m just curious. # A Soccer Match

Did you see that?  That was definitely a penalty.    Giuseppe:  No, I didn’t.  I was watching the goalie.  The referee isn’t doing anything.    Shandy:  I can’t believe it.  Why isn’t the coach talking to that referee?  I’m sure the other player deliberately kicked Fabio with his cleats.  Giuseppe:  Hey, look!  Fabio has the ball and he’s taking it all the way down the field.  He shoots, he scores!  That’s his second goal of the game.  He’s going to win the game for the team.    Shandy:  What’s he doing now?  Why is he on the ground?  Is he hurt?  Giuseppe:  I don’t know.  The trainer is helping him off the field.  It doesn’t look serious.  Shandy:  That’s good, but he hates sitting on the bench.  He won’t want to watch the rest of the match from the sidelines.    Giuseppe:  Look at the stands over there! # The Stock Market

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 276: The Stock Market.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 276.

We're going to listen to a conversation between Paul and Heather that uses some of the common vocabulary you would read about or hear about when talking about the stock market.  Let's get started.  > Heather:  What’s the matter?  You look terrible.  Paul:  Haven’t you seen the paper?  The stock market went down a lot yesterday.  The NASDAQ is down 100 points and the Dow is down 30!  My portfolio is in big trouble.  Heather:  I knew you had some stock options in this company, but I didn’t know you were so heavily invested in the market.    Paul:  I’m invested in the bond market, in derivatives, and I have shares in a lot of companies that took a nosedive yesterday.    Heather:  I’m sure you have a good stockbroker who has made sure that your portfolio is diversified and you have different kinds of securities.  Paul:  That’s my problem.  I don’t have a stockbroker.  I decided to invest on my own and to go for less secure stocks hoping for a better return.  I thought I could tell the difference between a bear and a bull market as well as the brokers.  I guess I was wrong. # Garage Sales

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 277: Garage Sales.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 277.

You can also download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even more.    Our episode is called “Garage Sales,” and it's a story of someone who likes to go and buy things from other people that they are selling at something called a “garage sale.”  Let's get started.  > One of the things I like to do on the weekends is go to garage sales.  I’m a bargain hunter and collector, so garage sales are good places for me.  I look in the newspapers or just follow homemade signs to find the sales in my neighborhood.  Whether it’s because people are doing spring cleaning or getting ready to move, there are always plenty of sales in my area.    After going to a lot of garage sales, I’ve learned a few things about getting what I want at the price I want.  Bargaining on price is par for the course at any garage sale.  If you don’t want to get ripped off, you’ll try to get the sellers to lower their price.  I’m an early bird and I usually get to the sales before other people to get the best items.  But to get the best prices, be sure to go back right before the sale ends.  Most people are desperate to sell so that they don’t have to store those things again or to lug them to a charity office to give them away.  That’s when people are ready to slash their prices.  It’s true that there is a lot of junk and knickknacks at garage sales.  But one person’s trash is another person’s treasure!
  Our story today is about garage sales.  A “garage” is a place where normally you keep your car.  A “garage sale,” however, refers to when a person decides to sell some of their own things to other people.  They take all their things that they want to sell and they put them in their garage and open the door, and people will come # Meeting the Future In-laws

This episode is called “Meeting the Future In-laws.”  Your “in-laws” are the relatives of your wife or husband.  Let's get started.  > Atsushi:  I don’t mind telling you that I’m really nervous about meeting your parents.  Scarlet:  You look like you’re about to face the firing squad.  It’s not going to be that bad.  Atsushi:  I wish I could believe that.  I’m going to try to make a good first impression, but I don’t think they’re going to like the fact that I’m a professional musician.    Scarlet:  I’ve already told them about you, so there won’t be any surprises.    Atsushi:  It doesn’t help that your last boyfriend was a straight-laced college student.  Couldn’t you have dated a convict before me?  I’d look pretty good to your parents in comparison.    Scarlet:  How do you know I didn’t?  You don’t know everything about me.  Atsushi:  Very funny.  Maybe we should postpone this visit with your parents for a little while.  Scarlet:  No!     Atsushi:  I’m just putting it out there. # Saying Goodbye

In this episode, we are going to learn how to say goodbye to someone that you know.  Let's get started.  > Mina:  I’d better be going.  See you later.  Oliver:  It might be awhile before we run into each other again.  Mina:  Why is that?  Oliver:  I’m going to Puerto Rico for three months starting next Tuesday.  I got a job there for the summer.  Mina:  I didn’t know that.  That’s great!  I’ve never been to Puerto Rico, but I’ve heard it’s nice.  Have a good trip.  It’s a shame we didn’t have more time to catch up.  Is your girlfriend going with you?     Oliver:  Yeah, she is.  She got a job there, too, so we won’t have to be apart for three months.    Mina:  That’s good.  It’s too bad I won’t get to see her before you two leave.  Give her my best.  Oliver:  I will.  Oh, I’d better get going or I’ll be late.  Mina:  It was good seeing you.  Oliver:  You, too.  Stay in touch.  Mina:  I will.  Let’s get together when you get back from Puerto Rico.  Oliver:  I’d like that.  Bye. # Viral Marketing

This episode is called “Viral Marketing.”  “Marketing” is a way that companies let other people know about their products and services – what they are selling.  Let's get started.  > Jayna:  I have an idea for creating buzz about our new product.    Maksym:  What is it?  Jayna:  I think we should use viral marketing.  We can spread information about the product quickly and among the most likely customers.  Maksym:  I really don’t understand it.  How would we do viral marketing?    Jayna:  Well, the key is to get plugged into a few people who have large social networks already, such as bloggers and other people with popular websites.  We get them talking about the product on their websites and people who visit those websites will tell their friends about it, and they will in turn tell their friends, and so on.  If we use these existing social networks, news about our product will spread very quickly.    Maksym:  What about the cost?  Jayna:  That’s just it.  It’s very low-cost because it works through word of mouth. # All-Inclusive Vacations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 281: All-Inclusive Vacations.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 281.

In this episode, we're going to talk about a special kind of vacation called an “all-inclusive vacation.”  Let's get started.  > Mei:  Let’s go on an all-inclusive vacation to a resort in Jamaica!  Guy:  I’d like to go to Jamaica, but I don’t know about going to an all-inclusive resort.  Mei:  It saves so much time in planning.  With these vacation packages, all of our lodging is included and we don’t have to pay extra for anything.  For one fixed price, we get unlimited food and drinks, and all of the activities and entertainment we want.    Guy:  It sounds a little too predictable to me.  You know that when I travel, I like to go off the beaten track.  The fun is in going out of the tourist areas to find the real character of a place.  Mei:  I know, but a resort has its pluses.  If we pick a good resort, we’ll know that everything will be first rate.  There won’t be any problems with substandard amenities or service.  Guy:  That may all be true, but I’m still not convinced.  I’d rather keep looking until we find a good compromise that will have the predictability you want and the spontaneity that I want.     Mei:  Okay, but we agree on Jamaica, right?     Guy:  Yeah, that’s right.  It’s Jamaica or bust! # Offending Someone

We'll hear a dialogue between Eileen and Colin, talking about a joke that one of them thinks is offensive.  Let's get started.  > I was telling my friend, Gina, a joke.  I began it by saying, “An Irishman, an Englishman, and a Frenchman walk into this bar, and…”  Suddenly, Gina grabbed my arm and shook her head.  I turned around and our coworker, Colin, was standing right behind me.  Eileen:  Oh, hi Colin.  I didn’t see you standing there.  Colin:  I guess you didn’t.    Eileen:  I was just telling Gina a joke...  Colin:  Yes, I know.  I heard.  I can’t believe you’re telling off-color jokes, especially at work.    Eileen:  I’m really sorry.  Please don’t be offended.  I didn’t intend to insult you.  I know that you’re from Ireland.  It was just a joke.  Colin:  It may be just a joke to you, but it’s getting a little old to me.  I already have a tough time fitting in as an outsider in this company, and I’m really tired of being the butt of jokes around here.  Besides, ethnic jokes reinforce stereotypes. # A Restaurant Drive-Thru

Let's get started.  > I had a little time between appointments and stopped at a fast food restaurant to get some lunch.  The idea was to save time by using the drive-thru, but it didn’t work out that way.  Order-taker:  Welcome to McDenny’s.  May I take your order?  Daniel:  Yes.  I’d like a cheeseburger, an order of French fries, and a large soda.  Order-taker:  I’m sorry, sir.  Can you speak up and speak directly into the microphone?  I can barely hear you.    Daniel:  Oh, okay.  I want to order one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a large soda.    Order-taker:  That’s four hamburgers, an order of French fries, and a sundae.  Would you like anything else?  Daniel:  No, I mean, yes.  That order isn’t right.  I wanted one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a soda.  Order-taker:  No problem, sir.  There’s no need to shout.  I can add those to your order.  That’s four hamburgers, one cheeseburger, two orders of French fries, a # A Friendly Rivalry

Let's get started.  > Veronica:  I’m finishing up for the day.  Do you want to walk out together?  Bogdan:  Yeah, that would be great, if you don’t mind waiting until I’ve finished sending this email.  I’m letting Tom know that I got another account.  That makes four new customers this week.  Veronica:  Congratulations, but isn’t that rubbing Tom’s nose in it?    Bogdan:  Don’t worry about Tom.  He’s been getting new clients left and right.  For the past six months, he’s been gloating about his big commissions.  I’m just turning the tables, that’s all.    Veronica:  Tom doesn’t seem like the type to be smug about his successes.  Bogdan:  He doesn’t flaunt it, but he lets people know in subtle ways.  Don’t worry.  I’m going to put him in his place.    Veronica:  This is just too much testosterone for me.  Why don’t you guys just go outside, duke it out, and get it over with. # A Movie Collection

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 285: A Movie Collection.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 285.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our episode is called “A Movie Collection.”  Movies are, of course, a very important part of Los Angeles culture.  Today we’re going to talk about someone who collects movies, and all the different vocabulary related to that.  Let’s get started.  > Some people collect stamps.  Other people collect CDs.  I collect movies.    I’m a film buff and I have a collection of my favorite movies of all time.  I usually buy a movie when it comes out on DVD, even if I’ve seen it already on the big screen.  I have a high definition TV and I like watching movies in the comfort of my own home.     I prefer the widescreen editions and the DVDs with a lot of bonus features.  I pride myself on finding every Easter egg on every DVD I own.  My friends think I’m crazy.  Even if I already own a movie, I’ll buy it again if there’s a special edition or box set with extra bloopers or deleted scenes.    Even when I’m on vacation, I look for DVDs.  Last year, I was traveling abroad and I bought some DVDs.  When I got home, though, I found out that I couldn’t play them in my DVD player because they had a different region code than the one we use in the U.S.  I also bought a bootleg DVD on the street and the quality was terrible.  I really learned my lesson on that trip!
  This episode is about someone who collects movies.  “To collect” means to get many of that particular thing because you like to have many things.  For example, people collect stamps; they try to get different stamps from different countries and put them all in a book.  Other people like to collect CDs, different types of music. # Describing Facial Features

This episode is called “Describing Facial Features.”  It’s going to be about a woman who was, unfortunately, robbed.  She’s going to try to describe who the person was that stole her money.  Let’s get started.   > I was mugged while I was walking home last night.  This morning, I was at the police station with a sketch artist to see if we could come up with a picture of what the thief looked like.    Sketch artist:  Okay, you said that this was a man in his 40s.  Can you tell me what shape his face was: thin, round, oval, or square?  Anna:  His face was long and thin, I think.  Sketch artist:  Were his eyes more round, bulging, or squinty?  Anna:  Well, I think they were round, but not too round, and he had bushy eyebrows.  He also had a pointed nose, not a hooked one.   Sketch artist:  Take at look at this so far.  Is this right?    Anna:  His nose in the sketch is a little too turned up.  It was more straight.    Sketch artist:  What about his ears?  Were they big or small?  And his mouth?  Did he have thin or thick lips? # A Traffic Jam

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 287: A Traffic Jam.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 287.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  This episode is called “A Traffic Jam.”  It’s a story about someone who gets on the road to drive, and finds that there are many other cars there that are slowing traffic down.  Let’s get started.   > I was on my way to a restaurant to meet my date for dinner when I hit a traffic jam.  I saw that the road was congested, but since I had to take the bridge to reach downtown, I had no choice but to stay on that road.    The traffic was bumper-to-bumper.  One crazy driver even tried to drive on the shoulder to get around the backup.  But as it turns out, there wasn’t any way to bypass it because the backup wasn’t due to an accident, a stalled car or some rubberneckers.  It was because of road construction and only one lane was open.    After 25 minutes of stop-and-go traffic, I was at my wit’s end.  My date was sitting at the restaurant waiting for me and I didn’t have her cell phone number.  What’s more, I was really hungry.    Finally, I got past the road construction and was on my way again.  I drove a little recklessly, but I had to make up for lost time.  I really liked this girl.  The last thing I wanted was to make her think that I stood her up!
  Our story is called “A Traffic Jam” (jam).  A “traffic jam” is when you have too many cars on a road, and that causes them to move very slowly or not move at all.  So, if you have too much traffic – too many cars – you have a “traffic jam.”  Here in Los Angeles, we have lots of traffic jams almost every day. # A Business Contract

Our episode is called “A Business Contract.”  It's a dialogue between two people – two business people – who are coming to an agreement about something.  Let's get started.  > Violet:  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me about the new contract.  It’s important that both parties understand and agree to all of the terms before we can move ahead.  Karik:  It’s in the best interest of both of our companies for this agreement to be signed, so I’m glad to be here.  How should we proceed?  Violet:  You and I have both read the contract, but I think it’s useful to go over the main articles to make sure there aren’t any clauses that are objectionable.  If you’ll take a look at Article One...   .......  Karik:  This looks in order.  The stipulations we asked for are all there.  Now if we can move to Article Six, I have a question about the conditions for declaring the contract null and void.  Violet:  I’m glad you brought that up.  I know that this was a sticking point during the negotiations and I believe we’ve found an acceptable compromise.    Karik:  I’m sure you have.  Let’s take a look.

Our episode today is called “Communication Problems.”  It's between two people – a dialogue between Ethel and Fred, who are a married couple having difficulty communicating with each other.  Let's get started.  > Ethel:  Can we talk?  Fred:  Uh-huh.  Ethel:  I don’t think we communicate very well.  We don’t talk to each other like we used to.  I think we need to have a dialogue about these dysfunctional communication patterns.    Fred:  Hmm.  Ethel:  I think we need to work on our relationship.  We have a strong foundation, but we have problems relating to each other.  Oprah says...  Fred:  Hold on!  Is this something you saw on the Oprah show?  Ethel:  Well, yes, it is.  Oprah did a show about how couples grow apart after years of being together, and good communication is the cornerstone of a good relationship.  Being a sympathetic listener and validating each other’s feelings are very important.    Fred:  Stop right there.  I’ll make you a deal.  I’ll communicate more with you, but you have to promise not to bring up Oprah again.  I don’t want a talk show host telling me how to run my life. # Riding the Subway

This episode is called “Riding the Subway.”  Let's go!  > Misha:  I’d like to buy a token for the subway.  Clerk:  The subway doesn’t use tokens anymore.    Misha:  Oh?  I didn’t know that.  It’s been a few years since I visited New York.  How do I pay for the fare?    Clerk:  You can buy a ticket for a single ride that expires two hours after it’s issued.  If you’re going to be here all week, I’d suggest getting a seven-day card that gives you unlimited rides.  Otherwise, I’d recommend getting a MetroCard.  Misha:  I’m only here for two days.  How much is each ride?  Clerk:  It’s $2.00.  If you buy a MetroCard worth more than $10.00, you get a 20% discount.  So with a $10.00 card, you get six rides instead of five.  The card allows you to transfer to buses, too.  Misha:  Okay.  I’ll take a MetroCard worth $10.00.  How is the money deducted from my card?      Clerk:  The turnstile automatically deducts the fare each time you go through it.  Here’s your card.    Misha:  Thanks, but I’m not sure which line to take to Queens. # Going on a Diet

Our episode is called “Going on a Diet.”  Let's get started!  > Decima:  My scale at home can’t be right.  I weighed myself this morning and I’ve gained another five pounds since last month!      Sebastian:  You’re not the only one.  My pants are feeling tight and it’s getting harder to see my feet!  Decima:  Okay, I’m making a decision right here, right now.  I’m going on a diet, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to shed these extra pounds.  Right after work I’m going to the drugstore for some diet pills.    Sebastian:  You’ll want to take it easy with those pills.  My wife took some diet pills last year and she did lose some weight, but she gained it right back.  She found it was better to eat right by getting plenty of fruits and vegetables, and to eat more low-fat protein and fewer empty carbs.  The truth is, she had been yo-yo dieting for years until she changed her diet and started exercising.    Decima:  Oh, no.  Not exercise.  I hate exercising.  I’d rather fast than go to a gym.    Sebastian:  That’s how I feel, but I’m starting to come around to my wife’s thinking.  Working out helped her with her 30-pound weight-loss earlier this year and she’s kept it off.  I may follow her example so I can get rid of these love handles.  Decima:  What kind of exercise are you thinking about? # Business Insurance

We're going to talk about different vocabulary related to insurance.  Let's get started.  > Carson:  What happened here?!    Samantha:  As you can see, there was an accident.  Early this morning, a man driving along this street lost control of his car and ran into the front window of our store.  Luckily, no one was hurt.  Carson:  What are we going to do?  We can’t open for business with this mess.  There’s glass everywhere!  Samantha:  I think the first thing to do is to call the insurance company.  We have full coverage, so I’m sure we’re insured against accidents of this kind.  As long as our policy hasn’t lapsed and we’ve paid our annual premiums, I don’t think we need to worry too much.  Carson:  Not worry too much?  But what if this is considered an act of God and we’re not covered?     Samantha:  Believe me, this will be covered.  When we call the insurance company, I’m sure they’ll tell you that. # Being Affectionate in Public

Let's get started.  > Nelly:  Look at that couple over there.  What they’re doing is indecent!  Sadat:  Where?  Oh, you mean those two people hugging and kissing?  That’s not indecent.  Nelly:  They’re not just hugging and kissing.  That girl is sitting on her boyfriend’s lap and they’re making out in the middle of a public place.  They need to get a room.  Sadat:  They’re just passionate, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  Don’t you remember when you were a teenager in love?  Nelly:  When I was a teenager, we behaved a lot more modestly.  We might hold hands or give each other a peck on the cheek in public.  That’s it.  Anything else we did, we did in private.     Sadat:  Oh, you’re not saying that you didn’t get cozy with your boyfriend as a teenager, you’re just saying you did it in private.    Nelly:  Right.  What I object to is having to watch other people’s public displays of affection.  It turns my stomach.    Sadat:  Don’t look now, but there’s another PDA over there. # Living in a Condo or Co-op

I’m really tired of the homeowner’s association in my condo building.    Ricardo:  What’s the matter with it?  Diane:  The people who sit on the condo association board are a bunch of do-nothings.  I’ve filed complaint after complaint and they refuse to enforce the house rules.  Ricardo:  Well, that might not be so bad.  I used to live in a co-op in New York City.  The board of directors in my building was constantly issuing violations to the shareholders and we were fined for the smallest infraction.  It was a nightmare.  What kinds of complaints have you been filing?  Diane:  I’ve been complaining about my noisy neighbors.  They have parties every weekend.  The board said it sent letters to them, but nothing has changed.  Ricardo:  That’s a tough one.  It’s often hard to get people to quiet down.  Diane:  That’s not all.  The common areas aren’t well maintained, and they’re often dirty or in need of repair.  Ricardo:  That’s too bad... # Playing Video Games

I like role-playing or simulation games a lot better.  Achim:  This isn’t just a fighting game.  You have to use strategy for each mission.  Check out these amazing graphics!  Marcia:  I can’t play that at my house.  I have a different console.    Achim:  Yes, you can.  It’s multiplatform.  Look at the box.  It says that you can use a joystick as your navigation system or a keyboard and mouse.    Marcia:  You know, right now I’m really into retro games.    Achim:  You mean last year’s games?  Marcia:  No, I mean really old school games, like the ones my parents used to play.  Achim:  You mean like Pac-Man and Pong?!  Marcia:  Yeah, exactly.  They’re classic and a lot less violent. # Bad Manners at a Business Lunch

Let's get started.  > Yolanda:  I will never invite George to another business lunch with clients again!  Sunan:  Why, what happened?  Yolanda:  George has the worst manners of anyone I know.  First of all, he was ten minutes late.  And as soon as he sat down, his cell phone rang and he answered it!  Sunan:  Maybe it was an important call?  Yolanda:  From his girlfriend?  It was completely unprofessional.    Sunan:  I know George is a little rough around the edges, but he’s not that bad.  Yolanda:  You don’t think so?  After I introduced him to the clients, he told them that he had been up late the previous night, because one of our other account representatives didn’t finish her proposal and he had to complete it.  Everyone knows not to air their company’s dirty laundry in public, especially in front of clients. # Being Rich and Poor

This episode is a dialogue between Lynn and Santiago about being rich and being poor in the United States.  Let's get started.  > Lynn:  I’ve been trying to help Monica find an apartment, but it’s impossible to find anything affordable on this side of town and near her work.  The only thing that’s within her budget would require a 50-minute commute each way!  Santiago:  I know.  It’s become really ridiculous.  I’m reading an article about how the income gap between the rich and the poor in this country is getting wider and wider.  Poverty is the worst it’s ever been in cities like L.A., while you see affluence everywhere.    Lynn:  I know I poor-mouth sometimes, but at least I can afford the basic necessities.    Santiago:  Yeah, I do the same thing.  I feel like such a hypocrite sometimes.  The other day, I was feeling sorry for myself because I couldn’t afford the fancy new car I wanted.  My old car isn’t that old!  I’ve only had it for five years and it still works, most of the time.  I forget about people who don’t have a car and are living on food stamps.      Lynn:  Me, too.  Looking for an apartment with Monica has really put things into perspective for me.  The next time I complain about not having enough money for a pair of new shoes or to take a vacation, remind me of the great inequities of this world, will you? # Visiting a Museum

Guard:  It’s open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday.  It’s closed on Sunday.    Rudy:   Thanks.  I’ll be back tomorrow. --------- The next day, I arrived at the Museum at 10 a.m. and the same guard was there.    Rudy:  Hello, again.  Can you tell me if the Museum has any tours?    Guard:  The Museum has a self-guided tour.  You can get information at the ticket window.  Rudy:  Oh, thanks.  Do you know if I can use my flash to take photos in the Museum?

So, you got an email from an old flame.  Very interesting.    Juan:  Well, that’s ancient history.  We lost touch after we went off to college.  Naomi:  What did she say in her email?  Juan:  She said she was going to be in town next month and wanted to know if I wanted to get together for dinner.  Naomi:  Are you going to go?  Juan:  I don’t know.  Her email came out of the blue.    Naomi:  Aren’t you dying of curiosity?  I know I would be.  Maybe she still has feelings for you. # Arriving for an Appointment

[Hangs up the telephone]  Ms. Gibbons says that she’s running a little late and is tied up in another meeting right now.  She should be wrapping things up very quickly and will be free in a few minutes.  Would you like to wait in the reception area right over there?    Juri:  Sure.  No problem.  Receptionist:  Can I get you something?  Coffee or tea?  Juri:  No, I’m fine.  I was just wondering how many employees you have in this office.
