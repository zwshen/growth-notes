This Winter we are going on a trip along the Appalachian Trail. The
trail is a continuous marked footpath that goes from Katahdin in Maine
to Springer Mountain in Georgia, a distance of about 2160 miles.  Even
though our trip will only consider some part of the trail, it will be our
first real backpacking experience and an excellent opportunity to
acquire winter camping skills.

<P align="justify"> Part of the experience is also the route planning
of the trip. We have a list of all possible campsites that we can use
along the way and we want to do this trip so that we only stop
<i>K</i> nights to camp. We also know in advance the distance between
consecutive campsites and we are only allowed to camp at a
campsite. Our goal is to plan the trip so that we minimise the maximum
amount of walking done in a single day. In other words, if our trip
involves 2 nights (3 days of walking), and we walk 9, 10, 5 miles on
each day respectively, the cost (maximum amount of walking done in one
day) is 10. Another schedule that involves walking 9, 6, 9 miles on
each day has cost 9.

<P align="justify"> 

Given the distances between <i>N</i> consecutive campsites of a trail
and given the number of nights for your trip, <i>K</i>, your task is
to devise a camping strategy for the specified trail such that it
minimises the maximum amount of walking done in a single day. Note
that the first distance value given is the distance from our
start-point of the trail to our 1st campsite, and the last distance
value given is the distance from our <i>N</i>th campsite to our
end-point of the trail.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
The input file contains several test cases, each of them    as describes below.
<br>
The first line of input consists of two numbers, the number
of campsites (<i>0 < N <= 600</i>) and the number of nights of
the trip (<i>0 <= K <= 300</i>). The following <i>N+1</i>
input lines indicate the distance in miles between consecutive
campsite locations. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>
For each test case, on a line by itself,
your program must output the maximum amount of walking in a single day for the
route that minimises such value.
