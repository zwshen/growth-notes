This episode is a dialogue between Max and Grace ab out providing “tech,” or “technical,” support. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Max: Hello, hello, is this call-in tech support?

Grace: Yes, my name is Grace and this is the help d esk. How can I help you today?

Max: I’m having a problem with my machine and I don ’t know what to do.

Grace: Have you tried reading our online troublesho oting guide or asking your question on the support forum?

Max: The what?

Grace: Never mind. Can you describe the problem you ’re having?

Max: It doesn’t work.

Grace: I understand that. What exactly is the malfu nction?

Max: It’s not working.

Grace: For me to diagnose whether it’s a software o r hardware problem, I’ll need more information. Unfortunately, I can’t repair it remotely.

Max: Okay, I understand.

Grace: Good. We offer all kinds of support, from se tup to customization to disaster recovery, but I can’t do anything if I don ’t understand the problem.

Max: Okay.

Grace: Could you walk me through what happens when you turn on the machine?

Max: Nothing.

Grace: Nothing? Nothing at all?

Max: Zip, zilch, zero.

Grace: Sir, is the machine plugged in?

Max: Oh, it needs to be plugged in?

[end of dialogue]

We are listening to a telephone conversation in tod ay’s dialogue. Max calls the “tech support,” or “technical support,” department of a company. “Tech support” refers to the people who help you with some problem  usually related to your computer or a piece of software – a computer progra m or application on your computer.

Max says, “Hello, hello, is this call-in tech suppo rt?” “Call-in” refers to someone who is calling by telephone to get help on somethin g. Max is calling the tech support department. He’s not emailing them or going  in and visiting them in person. Grace says, “Yes, my name is Grace and this  is the help desk.” The “help desk” is the department that provides tech su pport and other assistance at a company. The help desk might also answer your que stions about “billing” – that is, paying for your software or some service you are getting.

Grace says, “This is the help desk. How can I help you today?” Max responds, “I’m having a problem with my machine and I don’t k now what to do.” His “machine,” here, is his computer. Grace says, “Have  you tried reading our online troubleshooting guide?” “Online” means on the inter net, on the web. “Troubleshooting” (troubleshooting) – all one word – refers to the process of identifying the cause or reason for a problem and f inding a solution for it. Many websites have a “troubleshooting guide” that will h elp you find the answer to the question you have or a solution to the problem you have.

 Grace also asks Max if he’s asked a “question on the support forum” (forum). A “support forum” is a website or message board on wh ich people put questions and other people put answers. Some big companies ha ve support forums where you can go and ask a question and another person, o ften another person who uses the same application or the same computer, wil l be able to answer that question.

Max is confused by Grace’s question. He says, “The what?” He doesn’t know what Grace is talking about when she refers to the “troubleshooting guide” and the “support forum.” Grace says, “Never mind.” This  is a very common expression in English, “Never mind.” It’s a phrase that we use to show that we don’t need an answer to the question we just asked or simply to indicate that something is not important enough to repeat. Grace is telling Max to forget about the question she just asked.

Instead, Grace asks another question. She says, “Ca n you describe the problem you’re having?” Max says, “It doesn’t work.” Well, this doesn’t help very much. Max says, “It doesn’t work.” Well, what doesn’t wor k? What do you mean it doesn’t work? Max is not giving a very good descrip tion of this problem.

But Grace is very patient. She says, “I understand that. What exactly is the malfunction?” A “malfunction” (malfunction) is when  something doesn’t work correctly, when it doesn’t function correctly. “Fun ction” is another word here for “work,” as in “operate,” as in “do what it’s suppos ed to do.” But we still don’t know what exactly is the problem. And Max doesn’t help v ery much. He says, “It’s not working.” Well, once again, this is not a very good  answer since we don’t know what Max is talking about.

Grace says, “For me to diagnose whether it’s a soft ware or hardware problem, I’ll need more information.” The verb “to diagnose” (dia gnose) means to identify the cause or the reason for a problem. It is often used  in medicine by doctors. Doctors “diagnose” the illness or the disease that patients have. The doctor tries to figure out what is wrong with you. That is the p rocess of “diagnosing” the illness.

Tech support people also diagnose problems. They tr y to find out why your computer software or your computer isn’t working co rrectly. That’s what Grace is trying to do. She’s trying to diagnose whether this  problem is related to “software” or “hardware.” “Software” (software) refers to comp uter applications, or what we now simply refer to as “apps” (apps). “Software” is  made by writing what is called

“code” (code), which is basically a set of instruct ions that tell your computer what to do. “Hardware” (hardware) refers to the physical  computer itself.

Grace says she needs more information from Max. “Un fortunately,” she says, “I can’t repair it remotely.” “To repair” (repair) mea ns to fix something that is broken. “Remotely” (remotely) means, here, “from a distance.” Many people nowadays work “remotely.” They don’t go to their co mpany, to the office where their company is located, to work. They work from t heir house or from a café. That’s working remotely. Grace says she cannot fix Max’s problem remotely – that is, from where she is now.

Max says, “Okay, I understand.” Grace says, “Good. We offer all kinds of support, from setup to customization to disaster re covery, but I can’t do anything if I don’t understand the problem.” Grace mentions some things that her tech support department does, including “setup” (setup).  “Setup,” as a noun, is the process of preparing a computer to use it for the f irst time.

“Customization” (customization) is when you change something so that it fits your particular needs or wishes. It does exactly what yo u want it to do. Often, software will come with certain features, certain things tha t it does, but you want it to only work in a certain way, so you go in and you change the software somehow so that it works exactly the way you want it to work f or what you want it to do. That’s “customization.”

“Disaster recovery” is usually the process of helpi ng you get your computer working again after a major problem. If you drop yo ur computer into the water, for example, that would probably ruin your computer. It  would cause it to stop working. You might need “disaster recovery” in orde r to get the information off of your computer – the “data,” we would say, off of yo ur computer. That’s an example of “disaster recovery,” I think.

Grace says, “Could you walk me through what happens  when you turn on the machine?” “To walk someone through” means to explai n something to someone else step-by-step, using very specific details abou t what is happening. If you ask someone “to walk you through a problem,” you’re ask ing the person to tell you exactly what happens first, and then second, and th en third, and so forth. Grace is asking Max to walk her through what happens when  he turns on the machine. Max says, “Nothing.”

Grace is confused. “Nothing? Nothing at all?” she s ays. Max says, “Zip, zilch, zero.” Grace is asking Max what happens when he tri es to turn the machine on, and Max says nothing happens. Grace is surprised th at nothing happens. Max

then says, “Zip, zilch, zero.” “Zip (zip), zilch (z ilch), zero (zero),” all mean the same thing: “nothing.” It’s an informal way to emph asize that nothing is happening. In the U.S. sometimes people use the Spa nish word nowadays, “nada” (nada), which also means “nothing.”

Grace says, “Sir, is the machine plugged in?” Notic e the use of the word “sir” (sir) here. It’s a formal way of addressing a man, of say ing something to a man. You might hear it in a formal business situation such a s this. Grace, after all, is working for a company, trying to help the company’s  customer.

Grace asks Max if the machine is “plugged (plugged)  in.” A computer and most machines nowadays require some sort of electrical p ower. You get that power either from the battery or from the electrical syst em in your house or building. You have to connect your computer to the electrical  system by using a long piece of wire. The verb we use to connect that wire to the electrical system is “to plug in.” You “plug in” your computer. You connect your computer to the electrical power in the building or house where you are.

Max says, “Oh, it needs to be plugged in?” Max does n’t realize that his computer needs electrical power, which of course means that Max isn’t all that intelligent. He’s not very bright. He’s kind of stupid, in other  words. Grace doesn’t say anything. She just sighs. She goes [sigh]. Grace ca n’t believe that Max didn’t even plug the computer in. That, of course, is Max’ s problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
