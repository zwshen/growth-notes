Trick-or-treat! Today's podcast is all about Hallow een. Let’s get started.  > As a kid, I always loved Halloween. I liked dressin g up in a costume that I had picked out at the store or, more often, that I had made out of odds and ends at home. The best part was going trick-or-treating. So me years, I went with my brothers and sisters. When I got a little older, I went with my friends.  
> We would go to all the houses in our neighborhood a nd knock on the door or ring the doorbell. When the door opened, we would yell, "Trick or treat!" We never played tricks and always got treats. The neighbors would put some candy in our bags, and we would go home at the end of the night and eat to our hearts' content.  
> To get ready for Halloween, my parents would buy pu mpkins from the market or from the makeshift pumpkin patches on the side of t he road so we could make jack-o’-lanterns. We’d take a pumpkin, cut off the top, scoop out the seeds from the inside, and carve a face on the front. Sometime s we carved a scary face and sometimes we carved funny ones. At night, we would put candles inside the jack- o’-lanterns and put them on our doorstep.  
> One year we had a Halloween party. Our friends came  over dressed up as witches, ghosts, superheroes, cartoon characters, a nd anything else you can think of. We played party games like Bobbing for Ap ples, and we even created a haunted house in our backyard. It was a blast! Hall oween is truly a holiday for kids.

Today we are talking about Halloween, which is a ve ry popular tradition or custom here in the United States. It's not an offic ial holiday – it's not like Christmas or New Year's where you don't have to go to work – but it is very widely celebrated in the U.S. The name “Halloween” is a combination of two  

words: “hallow” (hallow) and “een” (een). “Hallow” is an old word for “holy,” and “een” is an old English word that means “eve” (eve) . The “eve” of something is the night before something.  

In the Catholic Church, November 1st is called “All  Saints Day,” or sometimes “All Hallows Day.” So, the night before All Hallows  Day is All Hallows Eve, which ended up being shortened to simply “Halloween.” “Ha lloween,” then, always falls on, or takes place on, the 31st of October. Hallowe en is a very old holiday that began early in European history – some people think  even before the days of the Romans. At the time, people would have celebrations  associated with the dead.  

Originally, the idea was that for one night, the de ad would come back to life and would go around looking for food. So, people would leave food outside their houses as gifts for the dead people. People would w ear masks over their faces to disguise themselves. A “mask” is something you wear  over your face so that people can't recognize you. The verb “to disguise” (disguise) means to change your appearance so people don't know who you are. B ut nowadays, at least in the United States, Halloween is a holiday for child ren to dress up in costumes and walk from house to house, getting candy from th eir neighbors.  

In the story, I say that “when I was a kid, I liked  dressing up in a costume that I had picked out at the store.” “To dress up” is a tw o-word phrasal verb that usually means to wear your nicest clothing. “I'm going to d ress up for the wedding this Saturday. I'm going to wear a suit and a tie.” But “to dress up” can also mean to put on a costume. A “costume” (costume) is clothing  that makes you look like a different person. So, you would get a police office r costume if you wanted to dress up as a police officer.  

We often made costumes out of “odds and ends.” “Odd s and ends” are just various things you have in your house: paper bags, material, string, whatever you happen to have. In my family, we would often make o ur costumes from odds and ends, from whatever it is that was in the house at that time. Nowadays, people go out and buy costumes. Sometimes, they can be very e xpensive. There are also stores that will rent costumes to you just for that  day.  

In the story, I say that the best part of Halloween  was “going trick or treating.” “Trick (trick) or treat” (treat) is what children s ay, or yell, when the neighbor opens the door. The children walk up to the door, t hey knock on the door, and they yell, “Trick-or-treat.” What they are really s aying is that either they will play a trick on the neighbor or they will get a treat.  

A “trick” here means something naughty, something s lightly bad that you would do to someone. We have the expression “to play a tr ick on someone,” which means to deceive or fool someone. A “treat” is a sm all surprise gift – often food, and in this case, candy. So, the neighbors are supp osed to give the children a treat if they don't want the children to play a tri ck on them. We call this tradition “trick or treating.”  

There is another story about the history of why we say, “Trick or treat,” which is that children used to have to do something entertai ning in order to get a treat. In this case, a trick could mean a song, a game, or so mething involved with magic. But in any case, at least nowadays in the United St ates, kids do not perform tricks. Instead, they knock on the door and they ex pect to get candy. So, if you live in an area, in a neighborhood, with children a s I do, you have to go out and buy some candy to give to the children who come tri ck-or-treating or you will be a very unpopular neighbor.  

After trick-or-treating, I say that we would go hom e with our candy and “eat to our hearts’ content.” “To do something to your hearts’ content” (content) means to do something for as long as you want to do it, to do s omething until you are satisfied. So, “to eat to your hearts’ content” mea ns to eat as much as you want with no restrictions, not stopping for any reason.  

I said that before Halloween, “My parents would buy  pumpkins from the market or from the makeshift pumpkin patches on the side o f the road.” A “pumpkin” (pumpkin) is a round orange vegetable that is very important for the celebration of Halloween. You can get a pumpkin either from the  grocery store – from the market – or from what is called a “pumpkin patch” ( patch). A “pumpkin patch” is basically a field where they have pumpkins for sale , often where the pumpkins themselves are grown.  

The word “makeshift” (makeshift) is an adjective me aning something that is temporary. A “makeshift pumpkin patch” is something  that they put together just for Halloween, and then when Halloween is over, the y take it apart. This happens a lot during holidays. You will see temporary or ma keshift places where you can buy Christmas trees during the Christmas season. Fo r Halloween, you can buy pumpkins. Even in the city you will find these make shift areas, usually on an empty parking lot where people sell things that are  for that particular holiday.  

My parents bought pumpkins so that we could make ja ck-o’-lanterns. “Making jack-o’-lanterns,” also called “carving a pumpkin,”  is another Halloween tradition. You carefully cut the top off of the pumpkin and th en you scoop out the seeds from the inside. “To scoop (scoop) out” means to sc rape out or to remove.   

 When carving a pumpkin, you first need to scoop out  the seeds that are inside the pumpkin. After you've done that, you then carve  a face on your pumpkin. “To carve” (carve) means to cut something very carefull y or precisely. So, you carefully take a knife and you carve a face on your  pumpkin. You make holes for the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and so forth. You ca n make a happy, smiling face or a mean, scary face.  

The carved pumpkin is usually called a “jack-o’-lan tern” (jack-o’-lantern). A “lantern” is something like a lamp – when you put a  candle inside a carved pumpkin, the light shines out through the holes of the face like a light or a lantern. You then put your “jack-o'-lantern” on your doorste p. A “doorstep” (doorstep) is the step or area in front of your house near the fr ont door. The door of the house is often above the level of the ground, so you have  to have stairs, or steps, in order to get up to the door.  

I said that “one year, we had a Halloween party,” m eaning the Halloween party was at our house. A “Halloween party” is often a co stume party in which everyone dresses up in a costume. At our party, peo ple came dressed up as witches, ghosts, superheroes, and cartoon character s. A “witch” (witch) is a woman who is said to have a magical powers. A man w ho has magical powers is called a “warlock” (warlock). A “ghost” (ghost) is the spirit of someone who has died. A “superhero” is someone like Batman or Super man. And “cartoon characters” are characters like Bugs Bunny and Mick ey Mouse. On Halloween, you can dress up as all sorts of things or people.  

At our Halloween party, we played party games like “Bobbing for Apples.” “Bobbing (bobbing) for Apples” is a traditional gam e at many American Halloween parties. To play, you fill a large contai ner, such as a bucket, full of water, and you put apples in the water. The players  in the game then have to get the apples out of the water without using their han ds. So, you would put your head in the water and try to remove an apple by bit ing with your teeth, which is harder to do than it sounds. That's called “Bobbing  for Apples.”  

I said that we even made a “haunted house” in our b ackyard. Something that is “haunted” (haunted) is something that is thought to  be influenced by, or affected by, some sort of spiritual or magical presence. A “ haunted house” is a house that is supposed to have spirits or ghosts living in it.  Creating a haunted house is another tradition associated with Halloween. We had  a haunted house in our backyard, which is the area behind your house.  

Finally, I said that our Halloween party was a blas t. “It was a blast” (blast) is an informal expression meaning it was a lot of fun.
