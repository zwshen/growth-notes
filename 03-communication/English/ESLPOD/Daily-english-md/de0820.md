This episode is a dialogue – what a surprise! – bet ween Cora and Doug about not doing your best at your job. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Cora:  What’s up with Rob? He hasn’t been himself l ately. 

Doug:  You’ve noticed, too, huh? 

Cora:  Yeah, he’s been missing work and letting thi ngs slip through the cracks. I’ve been cutting him some slack and filling in for  him, but things haven’t improved. 

Doug:  I know what you mean. I’d never known Rob to  drop the ball on anything until recently. I heard a rumor that he’s having fi nancial problems. 

Cora:  No, not Rob! He has more clients than anyone  around here.  

Doug:  Well, he’s been off his game for a while now , so some of those accounts might have gone up in smoke. 

Cora:  Are you going to have a talk with him? Maybe  you could help. 

Doug:  Me? Why me? 

Cora:  I thought you two were pretty tight. 

Doug:  We’re friendly at work, but we’re not really  friends. The last thing I want to do is to snoop around in his business. 

Cora:  But maybe he’s just waiting for a shoulder t o cry on. You might be just the person to get him to bare his soul. 

Doug:  Spoken just like a woman! You all think we m en are waiting to bare our souls and let our emotions out. Just leave Rob alon e to solve his own problems. 

Cora:  Spoken just like a cold-hearted man!

Our dialogue begins with Cora saying to Doug, “What 's up with Rob?” “What's up” means what's going on, what's the problem? What 's the issue with Rob? “He hasn’t been himself lately.” “To not be yourself” m eans that you're acting in an unusual way, a strange way. You're acting different ly than how you normally act. You may say to someone he hasn’t been himself. He’s  been very sad or depressed. Normally, he’s very happy. He hasn’t bee n himself. 

Doug says, “You’ve noticed, too, huh?” You’ve also noticed, Doug is saying. The “huh” at the end is sometimes used to ask a questio n when we've made a statement. 

Cora says, “Yeah, he’s been missing work,” he has n ot been coming to his job, “and letting things slip through the cracks.” The e xpression to “slip” (slip) through the “cracks” (cracks) means not to do everything yo u should be doing, especially the little things, because you're not being careful , you're not paying attention to everything. 

Cora says, “I've been cutting him some slack and fi lling in for him, but things haven’t improved.” “To cut someone some slack” (sla ck) means not to criticize someone or not to be hard on someone even though th ey're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, not judging someone e ven though they're not doing a good job. You're not judging them as you mi ght otherwise. You're perhaps not punishing them the way you would in a d ifferent situation. That’s what “to cut someone some slack” means. While Cora is cutting Rob some slack, she’s also been filling in for him. “To fill in for  someone” means to do someone else’s job for a short period of time, to help some one when they can't be at their job. So, you're supposed to work at a grocery store  and you can't be there one day and you're supposed to work, you ask a friend t o fill in for you, to substitute for you for that day. Cora says, “Things haven’t im proved.” Things haven’t gotten better. 

Doug says, “I know what you mean.” I understand you . “I’ve never known Rob to drop the ball on anything.” “To drop the ball” is a n expression meaning not to do something that you are supposed to do, not to meet your obligations, not to do what people expect you to do. Doug says, “I heard a  rumor that he’s having financial problems.” “I heard a rumor” (rumor) mean s I've heard something that people have said that it might be true, it might be  false – I don’t know. Another word we might use here is “gossip” (gossip). Gossip  or rumors are things that people say that nobody really knows if they're true  or not, usually they're interesting things, often bad things about people. We talk about gossip for famous people or about famous people, rumors. Some people say that she’s going to get a divorce or some people said that he is breaking up with his girlfriend. Those would be rumors. You're not sure if it's true. It might be true. (I'm not breaking up with my girlfriend because I don’t have a girlfriend.) Doug says that Rob might be having financial problems, not en ough money. 

Cora says, “No, not Rob! He has more clients than a nyone around here.” A “client” (client) is another word for a customer, e specially a customer that has a long-term relationship with your company. Often we use this term when we talk about services, selling people not physical things but, say, accounting services or legal services we may refer to someone as a “client .” Well, Rob has a lot of clients. Cora says, “… more clients than anyone aro und here,” meaning anyone here at this company. 

Doug says, “Well, he’s been off his game for a whil e now.” “To be off your game” means not to be performing as well as you normally do, not to be doing as well as you typically do. He’s been off his game for a w hile now, meaning for some time, so some of those accounts, some of those clie nts, might have gone up in smoke. “To go up in smoke” (smoke) means to disappe ar, to stop existing. “Smoke” is of course what happens when you burn som ething. It's the white, gray, or black substance that goes up into the air,  that’s smoke. “To go up in smoke” means to be burned up, literally, but really  here it means simply to disappear, not to succeed. 

Cora says, “Are you going to have a talk with him?”  Are you going to talk to him about this? “Maybe you could help.” Doug says, “Me?  Why me?” Cora says, “I thought you two were pretty tight.” “Tight” (tight)  here means to have a close relationship with another person, someone who is a very, very good friend who you give personal information to, who knows you ver y well. “Tight” has several other meanings in English as well. Take a look at o ur Learning Guide for those. 

Doug says, “We're friendly at work, but we're not r eally friends.” You can be friendly with someone by being nice to them, but th at doesn’t mean that you are  

their friend, that you actually consider them your friend. You're just being nice. Doug says, “The last thing I want to do is to snoop  around in his business.” “To snoop (snoop) around” means to try to find informat ion about someone without the other person knowing what you are doing. We mig ht say to spy on or to investigate in some secret way. Doug says he doesn’ t want to snoop around in Rob’s business, meaning in his life. Even though we  say business here, we really mean his personal matters, his personal life. 

Cora says, “But maybe he’s just waiting for a shoul der to cry on.” The expression “a shoulder (shoulder) to cry on” is used to descri be someone who is willing to listen to another person’s problems. So, you have a  friend and your friend broke up with his girlfriend and now he’s sad. Actually, his girlfriend broke up with him. She ended the relationship, and now he’s sad and yo u go to a bar and you have a few drinks and he tells you all the details of wh at happened. This happens to me every once in a while, a friend of mine – used t o happen – a friend of mine would break up with a girlfriend and then they woul d tell me all their problems, everything that happened, everything she said, ever ything he said – you understand. That’s to have a shoulder to cry on. Yo u are the person they go to to cry on, that is, to tell their problems to. Your sh oulder, of course, is the upper part of your arm and sometimes, for example, a woman may  cry on a man’s shoulder by putting her head on his shoulder if she’s sad ab out something. 

Cora says, “You might just be the person to get him  to bare his soul.” To “bare” (bare) means to take something off, to remove somet hing, usually your clothing. We talk about someone being “bare naked” meaning ha ving no clothes on. “To bare your soul” (soul), however, means to share you r most personal thoughts to another person, to tell someone your most secret fe ars and secret thoughts. 

Doug says, “Spoken just like a woman,” meaning Cora  is talking like a woman might talk. He says, “You all,” meaning you women, “think we men are waiting to bare our souls and let our emotions out,” our feeli ngs out. “Just leave Rob alone to solve his own problems.” In other words, men, we  don’t like to talk about our deep personal problems with other men. That’s what women think we should do, but we're men. We don’t do that, do we men? Real me n don’t cry. That’s what they say. 

Cora says, “Spoken just like a cold-hearted man!” S omeone who’s “cold-hearted” (hearted) is someone who doesn’t have a lot of symp athy or empathy for other people, someone who isn't able to understand other people or doesn’t feel badly when he does something wrong to someone else. That would be a cold-hearted person. Back in the 1980s, Paula Abdul had her song  “Cold-Hearted Snake.” A “snake” of course is an animal that crawls on the g round and moves back and  

forth. To call someone a snake would be a very insu lting thing, someone who is secretive, someone who deceives you, someone who li es to you, so she had this song: He’s a cold-hearted snake Look into his eyes Oh oh, he’s been telling lies. Cold-hearted snake, Paula Abdul. Sing that today at  your work. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
