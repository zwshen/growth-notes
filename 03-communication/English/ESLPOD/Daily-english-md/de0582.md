This episode is called “A Parent-Teacher Conference.”  It ’s a dialogue between Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Polo.  One is a teacher, one is a pa rent; they’re talking about the parent’s son and are going to be using a lot  of vocabulary that you would hear if a parent were talking to a teacher abou t how his or her daughter or son was doing in school.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ms. Vasquez:  Hello, Mr. Polo.  I’m Ms. Vasquez.  Please h ave a seat.

Mr. Polo:  Thank you.

Ms. Vasquez:  In this parent-teacher conference, I want to  go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores to talk about  his general performance in the classroom.

Mr. Polo:  That’s great.  I want to know how he’s doin g.

Ms. Vasquez:  Marco is a good student.  He’s attentive in cl ass, a hard worker, and hands in his homework on time.  Here’s his portfoli o, if you want to take a look at his classroom work.

Mr. Polo:  This is great.  Are there any areas he needs to work on?

Ms. Vasquez:  Marco is a good student, but he does sometime s misbehave.  He often has disagreements with other students and loses his t emper.  I think he needs to work on his social skills.

 Mr. Polo:  Well, I don’t think that’s the most importa nt thing, do you?  His academics are the most important and he seems to be doing  well in his subjects.

Ms. Vasquez:  It’s true that academics are important, but  learning to work cooperatively with other people is important, too, if he wants to get ahead in life, don’t you think?

Mr. Polo:  I’ll have a talk with him.  I’m sure you’ll  see an improvement.

Ms. Vasquez:  I appreciate you taking this seriously.  Again,  Marco is a good student and it’s a pleasure to have him in my class.

Mr. Polo:  I’m glad to hear that.  Good-bye.

Ms. Vasquez:  Have a good afternoon.

Ms. Vasquez begins our dialogue; she’s the teacher.  She s ays, “Hello, Mr. Polo. I’m Ms. Vasquez.  Please have a seat.”  Typically, teacher s would probably call parents “Mr.” or “Mrs. (Something),” not their first n ame unless they knew each other already.  Similarly, the parent would probably ca ll the teacher “Mr. (Something)” or “Mrs. (Something)” or “Ms. (Something ).”  Mr. Polo says, “Thank you.”  Ms. Vasquez asks him to “have a seat,” to sit down.  She says, “In this parent-teacher conference, I want to go beyond Marco’s r eport cards and his standardized test scores and talk about his general perfo rmance in the classroom.”  A “parent-teacher conference” usually is somet hing that schools will do (I’m talking about kindergarten through 12th grade  – through high school) about two or three times a year; some schools do it four  times a year.  This is one night when the teachers come to school, and the pare nts go and can talk to their student’s teacher.  The idea is that the parent can get a better idea about how their son or daughter is doing by talking directly to  the teacher.  When I was teaching high school and junior high school we would ha ve these parent-teacher conferences.  I absolutely hated them because, of course, all the parents think that their sons and daughters are perfect, and that i f they’re not learning something it’s because you aren’t doing a good job teachi ng rather than the kid playing video games five hours every night.  But, we’ll ge t back to the dialogue.

Ms. Vasquez says, “I want to go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores.”  “To go beyond (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to discuss or deal with something in addition to  what is expected, to go

 further into something than expected.  Normally, a teach er talks about a student’s report cards for example.  A “report card” is a piece of  paper – in the old days – where you show how the student is doing every “term,” eve ry part of the school year.  Sometimes two times a year, usually four times a ye ar, you give these report cards to the student.  The student takes them ho me and shows the parents, that will tell the parent how the student is doing in the different classes that the son or daughter is taking.  Hopefully, the chi ld doesn’t change the report card somewhere between school and home!  Nowadays, I suppo se, it’s all done through the Internet or Twitter – I…I don’t know.  “S tandardized test scores” are the scores – the marks, if you will – that a student recei ves on a test, a national test typically, that all students at his or her grade level  take.  So these are tests that usually private companies develop, and they give them  to thousands or tens of thousands students – perhaps millions of students – and it allows you to compare how much this student knows compared to the average  student. Standardized test scores; these are very important especially now in American education.

Well, Ms. Vasquez wants to go beyond the report cards and the standardized test scores to talk about Marco’s general performance in the classroom.  Mr. Polo says, “That’s great.  I want to know how he’s doing.”  Oh , really?  Ms. Vasquez says, “Marco is a good student.”  Probably lying!  She says, “ He’s attentive in class, a hard worker, and hands in his homework on time.”   “To be attentive” means that you listen to what someone is saying, you pay at tention to them.  A “hard worker” is someone who tries very hard to do what is expected or required of them.  “To hand in” is a two-word phrasal verb mea ning to give usually a piece of paper or a document or a form to someone in author ity, often for it to be evaluated.  So we talk about how students turn in the ir homework.  They give the piece of paper to their teacher.  The teacher then loo ks at it, grades it (sees if it is correct or not), and then gives it back to the student.  So, Ms. Vasquez is saying that Marco is attentive in class, a hard worker, and hand s in his “homework,” the assignments he does outside of school – at home, or the li brary, or wherever. “Homework” is one word.

Ms. Vasquez says, “Here’s his portfolio, if you want to look at his classroom work.”  Portfolios have been become popular in American schools in the last 20 years.  What happens is the student hands in different assi gnments – different things that he or she is required to do, and the teache r keeps all of these together in one place to be able to show them to the parent to be able to evaluate the student at the end of the term – the end of the semester, the three or four months of school.  That’s a portfolio.  “Portfolio” has other meanings in English that are not found in this Learning Guide.

 Mr. Polo, looking at this portfolio, says, “This is great.   Are there any areas he needs to work on?”  “To work on” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to try to improve something, to become better at something.  “To work” has a number of different phrasal verbs connected to it; take a look at the Learning Guide, where you will find those meanings.

Ms. Vasquez says, “Marco is a good student, but he does someti mes misbehave.”  “To misbehave” means to act inappropriately, to not do what you are told or expected to do.  It’s a word we use especiall y with children, whether they’re at home or at school.  So Ms. Vasquez now is start ing to tell the truth. She says Marco “often has disagreements with other studen ts and loses his temper.”  “To lose your temper” (temper) means become ve ry, very angry with someone; maybe you start hitting them or fighting with them even.  But, Ms. Vasquez doesn’t want to say that, she puts it very politely – very nicely, says that he loses his temper.  “I think he needs to work on his soci al skills.”  “Social skills” refers to the ability to be able to have conversations wi th other people, to be positive, to make friends; those would be good social skills to have.

Mr. Polo says, “Well, I don’t think that’s the most impor tant thing, do you?”  It’s not the most important thing for his son.  Of course, Mr. Polo doesn’t have to be the teacher and have this misbehaving student in his classroo m.  Mr. Polo says that Marco’s academics are the most important – the most i mportant thing – and he seems to be doing well in his subjects.  “Academics” ref ers to traditional areas in school – traditional classes: reading, writing, math, history, science, podcasting.  Mr. Polo says that Marco seems to be doing well in his “subjects,” in the classes that he is taking.  “Subject” has a couple of di fferent meanings however, and those are in the Learning Guide.

Ms. Vasquez says, “It’s true that academics are important, bu t learning to work cooperatively with other people is important, too, if he wants to get ahead in life, don’t you think?”  “Cooperatively” means that you are abl e to do things with other people without getting angry.  You’re able to do the m in such a way as that it is a positive experience and result.  American schools, again i n the last 25-30 years, have used cooperative learning groups to get children –  students – to learn how to work together; it’s a very popular approach.  Ms. Vasq uez says that Marco needs to work cooperatively with other people if he want s to get ahead in life. The phrasal verb  “to get ahead” means to be successful, esp ecially more successful than other people.

 Mr. Polo says, “I’ll have a talk with him (meaning I wil l talk to him about this in a serious way).  I’m sure you’ll see an improvement.”  An “i mprovement” is things getting better.  Ms. Vasquez says, “I appreciate you taking this seriously.  Again, Marco is a good student and it’s a pleasure to have him in class.”  “It’s a pleasure” means it’s nice to have him in class.  She’s lying,  of course!  Mr. Polo says, “I’m glad to hear that.  Good-bye.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
