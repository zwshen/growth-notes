[start of dialogue]

Diane:  This is so exciting!  I’ve never been to an  auction before.

Martin:  Sit down.  It’s about to start.  The aucti oneer is on the podium with her gavel and she’s ready to start the bidding.

Diane:  Are you bidding on the first lot?

Martin:  No, the reserve is too high.  See?  The op ening bid is over 10,000 dollars.  I’m not surprised.  Items of that quality  don’t appear on the auction block very often.

Diane:  What are those people doing on the phone?

Martin:  They are bidding on behalf of people who c an’t be here, the absentee bidders.  Hey, stop waving that paddle around!  The  auctioneer is going to think that you’re placing a bid.

Diane:  Oh, sorry.  Listen, the price is up to 30,5 00 dollars.  Going, going, gone! The auction house is going to make a nice commissio n on that one.  This is so much fun!

Martin:  Shhh!  I’m going to bid on the next lot.  Where is the paddle?

Diane:  The paddle?

 Martin:  Yeah, the paddle.  Where did you put it?

Diane:  I had it just a minute ago.

Martin:  Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.

Diane:  The auction block?

Martin:  No, the chopping block!

Our dialogue begins with Diane saying to Martin, “T his is so exciting!  I’ve never been to an auction before.”  An “auction” (auction)  is a place where things are sold to people who will pay more than the other peo ple who are there.  You can go to an auction for art, for cars, for land, for r eally anything that can legally be sold.  That’s an auction.  I say, “I’m going to pay  10 dollars,” you say, “I’ll pay 11 dollars,” I say, “Okay, I am going to pay 12 dollar s,” and so forth.

Martin says to Diane, “Sit down.  It’s about to sta rt.”  An auction – many auctions, anyway, are held in a room and there are people sit ting there, and each person is given a number on something called a “paddle,” whic h we’ll talk about in a second, and they hold that number up if they want t o buy the item.  Martin says to Diane, “Sit down.  It’s about to start.  The auc tioneer” – the person whose job it is to lead the auction, to announce what’s being so ld, and to ask people how much they want to pay – “The auctioneer is on the p odium with her gavel.”  A “podium” (podium) is an area that is higher up than  the surrounding floor, where a speaker will stand so that people can hear him or  her.  Professors in college or teachers in high school often have podiums; they pu t their paper on the podium and they stand behind it facing or looking out towa rd the class.  The auctioneer has something called a “gavel” (gavel).  A “gavel” is like a small hammer – wooden hammer that you hit against the table to get  people’s attention.  In a courtroom, where there is a judge, the judge typica lly has a gavel.  At an auction, a gavel’s purpose is to indicate that the thing tha t they are selling has been sold, that you cannot try to buy it after that point.  Ma rtin says the auctioneer is ready to start the bidding.  “Bidding” comes from the ver b “to bid” (bid).  “To bid” is to say that you are going to pay a certain amount of m oney for something at an auction.  “Bidding” is the process of many people t aking turns announcing how much they’re willing to pay for something.  Here in  the United States, the most popular online auction is eBay (eBay).com.  People say, “I’ll give you 10 dollars,” “Oh, I’ll give you 10.50,” “Okay, I’ll give you 11 dollars.”  Those are two different

people; you wouldn’t, you know, want to bid against  yourself.  That is, offer prices higher than your own price.  That would be crazy!

Speaking of crazy, Diane says, “Are you bidding on the first lot?”  Here, the word “lot” (lot) means a group of objects – a group of t hings that are sold together at an auction.  “Lot” has a lot of different meanings;  take a look at our Learning Guide for more explanations.

Martin says, “No,” he’s not bidding on the first lo t, “the reserve is too high.”  The “reserve” at an auction is the minimum price at whi ch something will be sold.  So, I give my computer to the auctioneer, I say to him,  “Sell this computer, but I will not accept anything less than 400 dollars.”  That’s  the reserve, the 400 dollars, the minimum I will accept.  The auctioneers typical ly keep a percentage for themselves, of course, usually around 30 percent I think.  Anyway, Martin says, “The opening bid is over 10,000 dollars.”  The “ope ning bid” is the bid that the auctioneer proposes or suggests as the first price.   After the auctioneer suggests a price and someone says, “Okay, I’ll pay that,” the auctioneer doesn’t suggest any other prices.  They will, instead, ask people i f they’re willing to pay more.  So if you say, “I’m going to pay 10,000 dollars,” I’ll  say, “Okay, 10,000 dollars.  Do I hear 11,000?”  “Do I hear” means is there anyone wh o will say they will pay 11,000, and someone may say yes.  You say, “Okay, 1 1,000, 11,000, 11,000. Do I hear 12,000?  12,000, 12,000, 12,000…”  For so me reason, auctioneers like to talk and repeat things very fast.

So in our story, the opening bid is over 10,000 dol lars for the first lot.  Martin says, “I’m not surprised.  Items of that quality do n’t appear on the auction block very often.”  The expression an “auction block” ref ers to a raised area where you can see the thing being displayed – the thing that is being sold.  In general, the expression means available at an auction or to be a uctioned.

Diane says, “What are those people doing on the pho ne?”  Martin says, “They are bidding on behalf of people who can’t be here.”   “On behalf of” means to do something for someone else.  So if there’s an aucti on in Paris, and I can’t be there, I send a friend of mine, and the friend will  bid on something and talk to me on the phone and say, “Do you want to pay 11,000?” and I say, “no,” or “yes,” and then that’s how I can participate in the auctio n.  He says – Martin – the absentee bidders are talking on the phone.  The “ab sentee” is the person who isn’t there; they are absent.  “To be absent” is the opposite of “to be present.”  If you’re “present,” you’re here; if you’re “absent,” you’re not here.  At school, we talk about people being present in class or absent from class.  Notice, present “in” class, absent “from” class; the prepositions a re different.  So, these are “absentee bidders,” people who are not physically t here.

 Martin says, “Hey, stop waving that paddle around!”   “To wave” is to move back and forth in the air.  A “paddle” is a flat, round or square piece of wood that has a number on it.  If you are familiar with the game of  ping-pong, or table tennis, the ball is hit with a small paddle.  It looks little l ike that kind of paddle.  It has a handle on it where you can pick it up with your han d, and if you hold it up in the air that tells the auctioneer that you’re willing t o pay that higher price.  So, the auctioneer doesn’t know your name, but he can see y our number, and he writes that number down saying, “Okay, that person will pa y 11,000.”  Well Diane, the dummy, she starts waving the paddle around.  Martin  says, “The auctioneer is going to think that you’re placing a bid.”  “To pla ce a bid” means the same as “to bid,” to say that you will pay a certain price for something.

Diane says, “Oh, sorry.  Listen, the price is up to  30,500 dollars.  Going, going, gone!”  After the auctioneer decides that no one el se will pay a higher price, he or she will say that phrase, “going, going, gone,” and  when they say “gone,” they take the gavel, the little hammer, and they hit the  table to indicate that that item is sold.  Diane says, “The auction house (the company that runs the auction) is going to make a nice commission on that one.”  A “c ommission” is a percentage of the sales price that you receive for selling a c ertain thing.  We talk about people at stores “working on commission,” meaning t hey will get a percentage of the price.  Many salesmen and saleswomen are workin g on commission.

Diane says, “This is so much fun!”  Martin indicate s for her to stop talking, to be quiet.  He says, “Shhh!  I’m going to bid on the ne xt lot,” the next group of things. “Where is the paddle?” he asks.  Diane says, “The p addle?”  Martin says, “Yeah, the paddle.  Where did you put it?”  Where did you place it?  Diane says, “I had it just a minute ago.”  She had the paddle just 60 sec onds ago.  Martin says, “Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.”  “ Or else” is a phrase used to show another person that you have to do what I am tellin g you to do or there will be negative consequences.  You don’t even have to say what those negative actions will be.  You might say, “Give me my pen ba ck, or else,” meaning if you do not give me my pen back bad things will happen t o you.  Of course, some people will say, “Or else what?” asking specificall y.  “Or else, I will punch you in the nose,” I will hit you in the face.

In this case, Martin says if Diane can’t find the p addle, he’s going to put her head on the block.  The “block” is also a term we can us e to talk about when they used to kill people by cutting, or “chopping” we would s ay, off their head.  We would call the place where you put your head down the “ch opping block.”  It would be a large piece of wood that would hold your head until  the person chopped it or cut it off.  Well, that’s what Martin is saying he’s going  to do to Diane, which of course

would be illegal in most countries.  You can’t just  go killing people!  Diane says, “The auction block?”  She’s confused; she’s not sur e where her head will be. Martin says, “No, the chopping block!” which is wha t we just explained.  In general, the expression “on the chopping block” mea ns that you are risking something valuable; you may lose something valuable .  Or a company might say, “The employees are on the chopping block,” they are  in risk of losing their jobs.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
