This episode is a dialogue between Nick and Jamie.  It’s going to be about when you have a professional athlete – a professional sp orts player who joins a team. “To sign them” means to get them to become a member  of that team.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  I don’t care what it takes.  I want Robinson  on my team next year.

Jamie:  He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding  a lot of offers.  I don’t know if we can make him an attractive enough deal.

Nick:  We’ll offer him a signing bonus.  That shoul d sweeten the deal.

Jamie:  I’m afraid that may not be enough.  Don’t f orget that he was a first-round pick in the draft.

Nick:  Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause.  With  that, he’ll be calling the shots and won’t have to worry about being traded to a tea m he doesn’t want to be on. He should be happy with that.

Jamie:  I don’t know.  His agent expects a lot of c ompeting offers.  We’ll have to pull out all the stops if we want to land him.

Nick:  Then we’ll do it.  We won’t be bested by any  other team.

Jamie:  Like last year.

Nick:  Last year?  Don’t remind me of last year!

This episode is called “Signing Professional Athlet es.”  “To sign (someone)” means to get them to become a member of your organi zation, usually your team. The verb is used in this sense when we talk about p rofessional sports players – professional athletes.

Nick says, “I don’t care what it takes (I don’t care how much money we have to spend).  I want Robinson on my team next year.”  Ja mie says, “He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding a lot of offers.”  A “f ree agent” is when you have a sports player – an athlete who doesn’t have a contr act with a team, or his contract is over and now he can sign a contract wit h whomever he wants; that’s a free agent.  “Fielding” comes from the verb “to fie ld” (field), and that means to receive and have to respond to.  Usually we use this verb when people are asking questions.  The person who answers the quest ions fields the questions; he or she takes the questions and tries to answer them.  But you could also use the verb, as it is in this dialogue, to mean look a t, evaluate, accept, or reject offers to come to a certain team or a certain compa ny.  When we say a player is “fielding offers,” we mean that many different team s are sending him or her ideas – proposals to get the person to sign with their te am.  An “offer” is a proposal: “Here’s how much money we will pay you if you play for our team.”

Jamie says, “I don’t know if we can make him an att ractive enough deal.” “Attractive” is something that he would like.  “Att ractive” can also mean beautiful; we say “she’s an attractive woman,” we mean she’s a  good-looking or beautiful woman.  But you can use the word also as an adjecti ve to describe things that are desirable, that people would want.

Jamie doesn’t know if the team Nick and Jamie for w ork for or own can make this can make this athlete an attractive enough deal – s ufficiently attractive.  A “deal” means an agreement basically, a contract.  Nick say s, “We’ll offer him a signing bonus.”  A “bonus” (bonus) is something additional,  something extra.  Often when you have professional athletes, especially when the y are young, they’re just coming out of college or sometimes high school, you  want them to play for your team so you’ll pay them a regular salary, but you’l l also give them a bunch of money as a bonus.  So, sometimes good professional athletes in baseball, for example, can get maybe a million or two million dol lars if they’re really good as a signing bonus.  You sign the contract and they imme diately give you a million dollars.  That’s how they got me to work here at ES L Podcast.  I got a huge signing bonus.  I think it was 10 dollars, somethin g like that!  Anyway, Nick says that they’re going to offer a signing a deal to this athlete.  Nick says, “That should

sweeten the deal.”  “To sweeten the deal” means to make an offer more attractive: “We offer you a million dollars and a b rand-new car.”  The car sweetens the deal; it makes it even more desirable – if you want a car.  I guess it depends on the car, too.

Jamie says, “I’m afraid that may not be enough (she  doesn’t think that will be sufficiently attractive).  Don’t forget that he was  a first-round pick in the draft.”  A “draft” (draft), when we talk about sports, is a sy stem that many professional sport organizations use to select new players, high  school or college graduates, young players who have not played for anyone else y et.  This is their first time as a professional player.  There’s a system called the  “draft,” basically what happens is you have all these different teams, mayb e 25-30-40 teams throughout the whole country; they may be football teams, they  may be baseball teams, and all of the young new players have to register for t his draft, if you will.  Then all the teams get together in a big meeting, and they go ar ound in a circle basically, and they say, “Okay, you get to pick one player,” and then each team gets to pick one player so that not all of the best players will go to a single team.  And after everyone gets one pick – one selection, then they s tart again.  The first selection – the first picks is called the “first round,” and then you have second round, third round, fourth round.  So for example, the Los Angel es Dodgers will get one first- round pick; every team gets one first-round pick, u nless there are certain cases where they don’t, but usually they do.  Then, they get a second-round pick, and a third-round pick, and so forth.  So that’s the syst em that’s used so that the good players go to different teams, so the teams are mor e competitive; they’re more or less equal in terms of their talent.  Well, the pla yer that Nick and Jamie are interested was a first-round pick in the draft, mea ning he was one of the best players when he first started.

Nick says, “Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause.”   A “clause” (clause) is part of a contract; it’s a paragraph or a section or perhap s even just a sentence in a contract – an official agreement.  “To trade a play er” means to sell the player to another team.  So a “no-trade clause” means that the team can’t trade the player, can’t say, “Okay, we’re going to send you to the Bo ston Red Sox, you’re not going to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers anymore,”  which is probably a good thing this year because, you know, the team isn’t that good this year.  Anyway, so you trade that player.  Well, the player might h ave a no-trade clause that says, “No, you can’t trade me because I don’t want to go to Boston.  It’s too cold there!” So, you can say no.  Only the very best players can  get a no-trade clause, so they can determine where they go and where they don ’t go.  Nick says with a no- trade clause this athlete will be calling the shots  and won’t have to worry about being traded to a team he doesn’t want to be on.  T he expression “to call the shots” means to have the power to say what will hap pen; you’re the person who’s

making the decision.  “Who’s calling the shots here ?”  Who is the person in charge?  Who is the person who’s making the decisio ns?  Not me, I can tell you that much!  Well, Nick says that with this no-trade  clause the player will be calling the shots, they will decide where they play.  They won’t have to worry about being traded to another team.  “Traded” means basic ally they sell you to another team, or they give you to another team and then the y get another player back for you, and that happens all the time in professional sports in the United States.

Nick says the player should be happy with that.  Ja mie says, “I don’t know.  His agent expects a lot of competing offers.”  The “age nt” is the representative, the person who takes care of the contracts, often a law yer.  Every professional athlete has an agent.  Actors and actresses also ha ve agents; they are not smart enough to do things themselves – no, I’m just kiddi ng!  They’re smart enough, some of them, but they’re very busy and, of course,  you want to have someone who’s an expert in law – in contracts to be taking care of your legal business, and it is, after all, a contract for working.  So, athl etes have agents, and the agents may get different offers from different teams; we m ight call those “competing” offers, because more than one team is competing for  that player – they both want to get that player.  Jamie says, “We’ll have to pul l out all the stops if we want to land him.”  The expression “to pull out all the sto ps,” or “pull out all of the stops,” means to do everything possible, to do everything y ou possibly can.  The expression actually comes from music, from playing an organ, where if you want the organ to play louder you would pull out all of the stops.  We won’t talk about organs right now, but the expression means to do ev erything possible.  Jamie says they’re going to have to pull out all the stop s if we want to land him.  “To land,” as a verb, here means to get something that is very valuable and very difficult to get.  “Land,” however, has a lot of di fferent meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some of those.

Nick says, “Then we’ll do it.  We won’t be bested b y any other team.”  “To be bested (bested) by (someone)” means to be defeated by or to be beaten by someone else.  Jamie says, “Like last year.”  Nick says, “Last year?  Don’t remind me of last year!”  We can guess that somethi ng bad happened last year. They didn’t get the player that they wanted, they w ere bested or beaten by another team.  Well, Nick says this year that’s not  going to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Nick:  I don’t care what it takes.  I want Robinson  on my team next year.

Jamie:  He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding  a lot of offers.  I don’t know if we can make him an attractive enough deal.
