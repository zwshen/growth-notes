<H1 align="center">Overlapping Air Traffic Control Zones</H1>
</font>

<P align="justify">
Optimization of air traffic flow is one of the essential ways for
airlines to maintain economic viability. All too often, however,
weather and other anomalous conditions disrupt air traffic flow
resulting in significant costs. Automation systems for optimizing
flows are not currently able to quickly reconfigure when path planning
must account for dynamic conditions such as moving weather
systems. Human intervention is usually used to decide route
modifications. 

<P align="justify">
Decisions on route modification for one aircraft must take into
account neighboring aircraft safe zones in order to minimize possible
collision risks. We will consider a 3D model in which the safe zone for
one aircraft is represented as a parallelepiped.

<P align="justify">
Evaluation of aircraft collision risks, in this model, can be done by
calculating the volume of the intersecting safe zones of the aircrafts
in a given air traffic control zone. In other words, we need to be
able to determine the volume of intersecting parallelepipeds.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>
Consider a number of parallelepipeds in space, having all the edges
parallel to the axes. Your task is to write a program that outputs
the volume occupied simultaneously by two or more parallelepipeds.

Each parallelepiped is characterized by 6 integer values, the
coordinates of two of its vertices<p>

<it>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>,
y<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>)</it> with <it>x<sub>1</sub> &lt;
x<sub>2</sub></it>, <it>y<sub>1</sub> &lt; y<sub>2</sub></it> and
<it>z<sub>1</sub> &lt; z<sub>2</sub></it>

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>
The input file contains several test cases, each of them consists of an integer <it>0 &le; n &ge; 15</it> in the
first line followed by <it>n</it> lines of 6-tuples of integers
describing the parallelepipeds. 
The total area occupied does not exceed <it>5x10<sup>8</sup></it>.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>
For each test case, output on a line by itself an integer corresponding to the total volume occupied simultaneously by two or more parallelepipeds.
