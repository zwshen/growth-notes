Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,295 – Buying a Watch. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,295. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

This episode is a dialogue between Jack and a clerk , someone who sells things for a store, about buying a wristwatch. Let’s get s tarted. 

[start of dialogue] 

Clerk: Hello, are you shopping for a watch for your self? 

Jack: Yes, I’m looking for a dress watch, something  understated with a simple face. 

Clerk: We have plenty to choose from. Let me show y ou these quartz watches. 

Jack: I’m looking for something with an automatic m ovement, something that is self-winding. 

Clerk: Oh, in that case, let me show you these. The se have the finest workmanship you’ll find anywhere, with very hard cr ystals. Are you looking for something with a bezel? A leather strap or a metal one? 

Jack: I’m not sure. My diving watch has a bezel and  chronograph, but I’m looking for something simpler. What’s the difference betwee n these two? 

Clerk: This one has luminous hands and dial and is waterproof, and the other doesn’t have either feature.  

Jack: Hmm, I can’t decide. I’ll take this one, this  one, and this one. 

Clerk: All three?  

Jack: Yes.  

Clerk: Let me show you these diamond-encrusted watc hes we just got in. 

Jack: You think I need more than four watches? 

Clerk: No man of style would be without at least a dozen.

This episode is all about buying or purchasing a “w atch” (watch), which is of course a small clock that tells you the time. Nowad ays when we say “watch,” we usually think of what was called more popularly in earlier years a “wrist (wrist) watch” because you wear it on the wrist of your han d – or the wrist of your arm, I should say. The “wrist” is where your arm meets you r hand, where they connect. There are also “pocket watches” that people used to  wear many years ago, not so much anymore, that you keep in your pocket. Nowa days, of course, many people don’t wear watches at all. They just look at  their phone to see what time it is.  

The dialogue begins with the clerk saying to Jack, “Hello, are you shopping for a watch for yourself?” Jack says, “Yes, I’m looking f or a dress watch.” A “dress watch” is a watch that you would wear to a formal o r business event. It isn’t a big watch, one that has a lot of different functions on  it. It’s not a watch that does a lot other than tell you the time, but it looks nice . So, we call it a “dress watch.” Jack says he wants something “understated with a si mple face.” “Understated” (understated) means it’s simple or it doesn’t draw attention to itself. It’s not something that people will immediately notice, perh aps.  

Jack wants a watch with a “simple face.” The “face”  of the watch is the front of it. We also talk about the “face” of a clock. It’s the part that you can see that has the numbers on it and the lines that indicate the time,  what we would call the “hands” (hands). In traditional watches, there are two hand s on the watch – a big hand, which is the longer of the two, and a little hand. Many watches, of course, don’t have any hands at all, but rather just have numbers . These are electronic watches.  

The clerk says to Jack, “We have plenty to choose f rom,” meaning we have a lot of watches that you can select from. “Let me show y ou these quartz watches.” “Quartz” (quartz) is a kind of stone or crystal tha t is used to keep time. A “quartz watch,” then, uses a crystal to keep time, not what  we would call a “mechanical device.” Jack says, “I’m looking for something with  an automatic movement, something that is self-winding.” “Automatic movemen t” means pretty much the same as “self (self) – winding (winding).”  

An “automatic movement” or “self-winding” watch use s the movement of the hand or the arm to help keep the watch going; it ac tually helps “wind” the watch. “To wind” (wind) means to move a small knob, someth ing that is on the side, typically, of a watch that is used to give the watc h energy so that it keeps going. We would say it keeps “ticking” (ticking). “To tick ” means to work or to function, especially when talking about a watch.  

There are a little wheels inside of the watch that move, and they make, often, a small, what we would describe as, “ticking” sound. This is related to another expression that is used to describe the sound a clo ck or a watch makes, which is “tick tock” (tock). In any case, the clerk says, “L et me show you these.” She’s showing him some self-winding watches. She says, “T hese have the finest workmanship you’ll find anywhere, with very hard cr ystals.”  

“Workmanship” (workmanship) refers to the quality a nd skill with which something is made. Something that is made very well  is something made with “fine workmanship.” These watches, according to the  clerk, have “very hard crystals.” In this case, the word “crystal” refers to the cover that protects the face of the watch. Most watches have some sort of coveri ng over the hands of the watch. The clerk says, “Are you looking for somethi ng with a bezel? A leather strap or a metal one?” A “bezel” (bezel) is a small  ring or circle around that crystal covering of the watch. Often it has numbers  on it.  

The watch is held onto your wrist by a, we would ca ll, “wristband” (band) or a “strap” (strap). The strap can be made out of “leat her” (leather) or “metal” (metal), or at least those are the two most common materials  or things we make watch bands out of. “Leather” is a material that comes fr om the skin of an animal, such as a cow. A “metal strap” would be made out of some thing such as iron, steel, silver, or other kinds of hard metals.  

Jack says he’s not sure. He says, “My diving watch has a bezel and a chronograph but I’m looking for something simpler.”  A “diving (diving) watch” is one that you can use to go swimming or down into th e ocean or a lake. When you go down into the ocean or lake, you “dive” into  that water. In fact, “diving” is usually done with some sort of special equipment, a llowing you to breathe for a long time underwater.  

A “chronograph” or “chronograph” (chronograph) is a nother word for what is more commonly called a “stopwatch.” It’s a watch yo u use to determine how long something is going on. If you are running a race, f or example, you will have someone typically who has a stopwatch, who turns a watch on when you start  

running and off when you finish. That tells you how  long someone has been doing something.  

Jack says he’s looking for something simpler than h is diving watch. He then asks what the differences are between two different kind s of watches he’s looking at. The clerk explains, “This one has luminous hands an d dial and is waterproof.” “Luminous” (luminous) means that it can be seen eve n when it is dark out. So, the hands that, you remember, indicate what time it  is are luminous on this particular watch and so is the “dial” (dial). The d ial of a clock or a watch is just another word for the face of it – the front of it t hat has the numbers on it.  

The clerk also tells Jack that the watch he’s looki ng at is “waterproof” (waterproof). Something that is waterproof is somet hing that is usually sealed so that the water will not harm it, will not damage it . You can put a waterproof watch in the water and it will still work just fine. Nowa days companies are starting to make waterproof phones, although they’re still not quite perfect from what I hear. 

In any case, the clerk is showing Jack these watche s and he says, “I can’t decide.” Then he says, “I’ll take this one, this on e, and this one,” and he’s indicating three watches that he wants to buy. The clerk is surprised. She says, “All three?” Jack says, “Yes.” Then the clerk, real izing that perhaps he can sell Jack something even more expensive because he obvio usly has a lot of money, says to him, “Let me show you these diamond-encrust ed watches we just got in,” meaning that just arrived to our store.  

“Diamonds” (diamonds) are clear, hard stones that a re very valuable. Women often get a diamond ring when they get married, as do some men. I don’t have a diamond on my wedding ring. I just have what’s call ed a “wedding band” (band). I mentioned previously about watch bands that go arou nd your wrist. Well, a “wedding band” goes around your finger, but of cour se it doesn’t have a watch on it. 

Anyway, the clerk says that these watches are “diam ond-encrusted” (encrusted). “Diamond-encrusted” means that they are decorated w ith diamonds or that there are many diamonds on the watch itself. Jack says, “ You think I need more than four watches?” He’s wondering why the clerk is tryi ng to sell him another watch. The clerk responds by saying, “No man of style woul d be without at least a dozen.”  

The phrase “a man of style” (style) refers to a man  who has good taste, who knows what good clothing looks like and good watche s. No such man, according to the clerk, who of course wants to make more mone y by selling the customer  

another watch, would be without at least a dozen, m eaning a man of style would have at least 12 watches and probably more.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
