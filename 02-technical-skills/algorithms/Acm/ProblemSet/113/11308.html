<p>Wolfgang Puck has an extensive collection of cake recipes. They are separated
into different binders depending on the type of cake. Although Wolfgang has
restaurant franchises all over the world, he is in a period of hard times and is
struggling to afford ingredients for his cakes. What cakes can he create with
his small budget?</p>


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line you are given <em>t</em> (1 &le; <em>t</em> &le; 100), the number of binders.
Each binder begins with <em>title</em>, the name of the binder, then on the next line
<em>m n b</em> (1 &le; <em>m, n</em> &le; 100, 1 &le; <em>b</em> &le; 10<sup>6</sup>)
where <em>b</em> is Wolfgang's budget
in dollars. The next m lines are given as "<em>ingredient c</em>" (see sample input)
where <em>c</em> (0 &le; <em>c</em> &le; 5000) is the price in dollars for one unit of ingredient.</p>

<p>Then follow <em>n</em> recipes. Each recipe begins with <em>name</em> on a line of its own,
then on the very next line <em>k</em> (1 &le; <em>k</em> &le; 100). The following <em>k</em> lines are of
the form "<em>requirement x</em>" (see sample input) where <em>x</em> is the number of units of
the ingredient <em>requirement</em> used in the recipe <em>name</em>.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each binder, output the name of the binder in uppercase letters then on
separate lines a list of recipes within Wolfgang's budget in increasing order of
cost. If no such recipe exists, print "Too expensive!". If recipes have the same
cost print them in lexicographical order. Print a blank line after each binder.</p>
