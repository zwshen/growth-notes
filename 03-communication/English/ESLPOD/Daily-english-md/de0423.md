This episode is a dialogue between Wendy and Ichirou.  T hey are going to be talking about something that you will find in most Amer ican grocery stores (food stores), and that is food labels.  The government requir es that many, or most kinds of food have a label on them that gives you inform ation about what is inside the food and other what we would call “nutritional i nformation.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I never read food labels until I started going out wit h Wendy.  She’s studying to be a nutritionist.  When we go grocery shopping, she rea ds every label. ________

Wendy:  You’re not buying that, are you?

Ichirou:  Well, I was thinking about it.  Why?

Wendy:  Each serving size has 30 grams of fat, and 10 of t hose are trans fat. The sodium level is through the roof, and it’s full of carbohydrates.  Do you really want to put that in your body?

Ichirou:  Um, I guess not.

Wendy:  What are these cookies doing in the basket?

Ichirou:  Those are my favorite.  I always get them.  I g ot the low-fat kind, see?

Wendy:  Even so, they’re full of calories.  They may be red uced fat, but they’re not low fat.  You don’t eat this kind of cereal do you?

 Ichirou:  Yeah, I do.

Wendy:  Look at the percent daily values.  You get nearly no nutrients and no dietary fiber, and it’s full of sugar. ________

I really like Wendy, but I’m not sure how long I can take  this.  She has the best of intentions, but will my stomach ever forgive me if I keep going out with her? That’s the question.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ichirou saying “I never read f ood labels until I started going out with Wendy.”  A “food label” is a piece of p aper that has written information about it on a piece of packaging for food.   So, it’s on the outside of the food package where you will find the food label.  He says he never read food labels until he started going out with (until he star ted dating) Wendy.  Wendy’s been studying to be a nutritionist.  A “nutritionist” is a person whose job it is to help people eat better, so they get better food perha ps because they need to lose weight or for some medical reason.

He says, “When we go grocery shopping (when we go shoppin g for food), Wendy reads every (food) label.”  Then we go into dialogue: Wendy says, “You’re not buying that, are you?”  Obviously, Wendy doesn’t like what  Ichirou is going to buy.  He says, “Well, I was thinking about it (meaning yes , I was planning on it). Why?”  Wendy says, “Each serving size has 30 grams of fat.”  T he “serving size” is the amount of a particular food that should be eate n by one person.  Many foods are sold in large containers, so there’s more than one serving, more than enough needed for one person.  There could be two, or  three, or five or six servings in that package, meaning five or six people would have enough food to eat from that package.

“Each serving size,” Wendy says, “has 30 grams of fat.”  A “ gram” is a unit of measurement for weight.  “Fat” is the oily part of foo ds; fat is a kind of food. Food has protein and carbohydrates, and it also can have f at.  Certain kinds of fat are considered bad for your health, especially satu rated fats and trans fat. Wendy says that there are 10 grams of trans fat in that particular package.  Trans fat is now considered the most unhealthy kind of fat beca use it can increase (or raise) your risk of having a heart attack.

 Wendy says, “The sodium level is through the roof.”  “Sodi um” is another word for salt; it’s the chemical element Na.  “Through the r oof” is an expression that means very high or a very large number.  “The price of ga soline in the U.S. went through the roof last year” – it became very expensive, very high in price.  So, the sodium level is very high in this piece of food and “it’s f ull of carbohydrates.” Remember, we talked about food having different elem ents (different parts).  One element is carbohydrates.  “Carbohydrate” is the part of a food that is used to make energy – that the body uses to make energy.

Well, Wendy says to Ichirou, “Do you really want to put th at in your body?”  Of course, he probably does, but because she is his girlfriend he wants to keep her happy, so he says, “Um, I guess not,” meaning no, I don’t.   Wendy says, “What are these cookies doing in the basket?” meaning why did yo u put cookies in their shopping basket.  A “shopping basket” is a container you use  to put your food in in a store before you pay for it.  It helps you move the food around the store.

Ichirou says, “Those are my favorite (my favorite cookies).  I  always get them.  I got the low-fat kind, see?”  When a food is called “lo w-fat” it means it has only a small amount of fat in it.  Some people try to buy foo d that is low fat because they think it is better for them.  However, Wendy points out the cookies are still “full of calories.”  A “calorie” is a measurement, technically, of the amount of energy in food.  If you eat more calories you will gain more we ight – if you eat too many calories, I should say.  If you don’t eat enough calories, then you will lose weight. So, when Wendy says the food is full of calories, she mean s they have a lot of calories – too many calories.  Wendy says, “They may be reduce d fat, but they’re not low fat.”  Food that is “low fat” has very little fat in it.  Food that is “reduced fat” has less fat than normal, but more fat than low fat.  So, it’s somewhere between normally and low fat.

Wendy says, “You don’t eat this kind of cereal do you?”  “C ereal” is a food often eaten at breakfast.  Usually it’s small, dry pieces of foo d made from grains, and you put them in a bowl with milk and you eat them with  a spoon.  I have cereal every day for breakfast.  Wendy obviously doesn’t like the cere al that Ichirou eats.  He says, “Yeah, I do,” meaning I do eat that kind  of cereal.  Wendy says, “Look at the percent daily values.”  The “percent daily val ue” is the piece of information found on the food label that tells you the percentage of the recommended amount of something that people are suppose d to eat every day that is in that particular food.  So, it might say for  example, this bread has a percent daily value of 20 percent for vitamin A.  That m eans this food has about 20 percent of the vitamin A that you will need in any g iven day.  A single serving, typically, has that percentage.

 Wendy says, “You get nearly no nutrients.”  “You get near ly no” means you get almost no nutrients.  A “nutrient” is a vitamin, a mine ral, or another part of the food that you eat that helps you become strong and keeps yo u healthy.  So nutrients are good things.  The food also has “no dieta ry fiber.”  “Dietary fiber,” or simply “fiber,” is a kind of food or part of food then you eat but it cannot be used by the body (the fiber), but it helps keep the food mo ving through your body, and that is dietary fiber’s purpose.  Salads, whole grains – these have, typically, a lot of dietary fiber.  She says the cereal is “full of sugar.”   “Sugar,” sometimes called “sucrose” or “glucose,” is the sweet tasting part of food.   “Sugar” has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “fat.”   Take a look at our Learning Guide for additional explanations of both of  these terms.

Ichirou is not sure he wants to continue dating Wendy.  He says, “I really like Wendy, but I’m not sure how long I can take this.”  Whe n we say we “can take” something, we mean we are able to continue doing this,  listening to this, without becoming angry or upset.  It means to tolerate somethin g – to “take” something. “I can’t take this music” – I can’t tolerate this music, I  cannot listen to this music anymore.  He says Wendy “has the best of intentions, but wi ll my stomach ever forgive me if I keep going out with her?”  The expressio n “the best of intentions” means that the person wants to do something well; they want to do something that is good, but that’s not actually what they do.  You r “intention” is your desire, what you want to happen, but sometimes our intentions a re not the same as what we actually do.  Wendy has the best of intentions, she “me ans well” we might also say, but poor Ichirou doesn’t think he can continue g oing out with her because she keeps criticizing the kind of food that he eats.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
