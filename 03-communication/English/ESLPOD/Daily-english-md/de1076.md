This episode is a dialogue between Nick and Jessica  about selling things using the name of a famous person. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick: The possibilities are endless! You have to ta ke advantage of being at the height of your career.

Jessica: I don’t know about lending my name to a ce lebrity product line. Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?

Nick: Of course not. Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame into a successful business.

Jessica: But licensing my name to a lot of products  that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my time.

Nick: But think of the upside. You would be buildin g a brand with longevity, hedging your bets for the future.

Jessica: You mean in the future when I’m no longer as famous or as popular.

Nick: No, of course that’s not what I mean. You’ll be a star forever. But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is  good?

Jessica: I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are  we talking about?

Nick: We can start with a clothing line and then br anch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.

 Jessica: Weight-loss products?! What are you implyi ng?

Nick: Nothing! I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I meant food – glamorous, beautiful food. See what I mean? The sky’s the limi t!

Nick begins our dialogue by saying to Jessica, “The  possibilities are endless.” A “possibility” is something that could happen. When we say something is “endless” (endless), we mean that there is no maximum – it co uld be as many as possible. “The possibilities are endless,” then, means that t here are many possibilities. Usually we’re talking about good things that could happen.

Nick says to Jessica, “You have to take advantage of being at the height of your career.” “To be at the height (height) of your care er (career)” means that you are at the best moment or the most successful moment in  your line of work, in what you do. Your “career” is your job. It’s the thing t hat you do to make money, usually. “To be at the height” of something means t o be at the highest point – to be at a point where, in this case, you are the most  successful. Perhaps you are making the most money that you will ever make, or y ou are more popular than you will ever be.

Jessica says, “I don’t know about lending my name t o a celebrity product line.” “To lend” (lend) means to let someone use something  for a period of time. Jessica is talking about “lending her name.” “To le nd your name” means to let your name be associated with something else. In the  United States, it’s popular for certain movie stars or music stars to lend thei r name to certain products, things that companies sell. Sometimes they actually  sell the product using the name of the person.

So, for example, there might be a kind of perfume t hat is sold using the name of some famous actress or singer. “Perfume” (perfume) is liquid that you put on your body to make you smell nice. Usually we use the term “perfume” to refer to what a woman would put on her body. Jessica doesn’t  know about – she’s not sure about – lending her name to a celebrity produc t line. A “celebrity” (celebrity) is a famous person. A famous actor, a famous singer , a famous podcaster – all of these could be celebrities, except that last exampl e.

“Product” refers to something that you sell. A “pro duct line” is a group of products, a group of related things that you would sell. So, a “celebrity product line” would be a group of things that are sold usin g the name of a famous person.

Jessica says, “Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?” The phrasal verb “to sell out” has a couple of different meanings. Here it me ans to do something in order to make money, but to do something that somehow doe sn’t match with your principles or your morals or your values or your id entity, even.

So, for example, a popular singer writes a song. the song becomes a “hit,” meaning it becomes very successful, and then a few years later, the singer will sell this song, or the rights to use the song, to a  company in order for the company to use that song in a commercial. Some peop le would say that the artist, the singer, has “sold out.” “He sold out,” meaning he’s decided that he was going to get money for what he wrote rather than ke eping himself as a real artist.

I don’t know if this is really true – if you could consider someone selling their song to be “selling out” – but that’s the idea behi nd the phrasal verb “to sell out.” The other possibility or the other possible meaning  of the verb “to sell out” would be for a store to sell all that it has of a certain  product – to no longer have any available because they have all been sold.

Nick doesn’t think Jessica would be selling out. He  says, “Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame i nto a successful business.” “To leverage” (leverage) means to use something tha t you have now in order to get something better in the future. “To leverage yo ur influence,” for example, would mean to use your influence in order to get a better situation, or perhaps to make more money. “Leveraging your celebrity” would be to use your fame, the fact that you are popular, in order to make even mo re money, or perhaps to become even more famous.

Jessica says, “But licensing my name to a lot of pr oducts that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my tim e.” Jessica is saying that she doesn’t want to license her name to a lot of produc ts. “To license” (license) means to allow or to let another company or another  person use something that you have created. You might, for example, write a s ong, and then you let another person use that song in order to make money. You wo uld “license” the song to that person, meaning that person has to give you so me money for using your song.

Jessica doesn’t want to have to promote a lot of pr oducts. “To promote” here means to let people know about something – to go ou t and tell people, in this case, to buy these products. When a writer publishe s a book, he or she often goes and promotes the book by going on television p rograms and radio interviews and that sort of thing.

Nick says, “But think of the upside.” The “upside” (upside) of something is the advantage of something, the good result or conseque nce that can happen if you do a certain thing. The upside of saving a lot of m oney now when you’re young is that when you are old, you will have money to live on. The “upside” is the advantage. The opposite of “upside” is, of course, “downside” (downside). The downside of something would be the disadvantage, the negative consequence of some action.

Nick says, “You would be building a brand with long evity, hedging your bets for the future.” A “brand” (brand) is a name or a symbo l that is associated with a certain kind of product. You can think of, for exam ple, the kind of toothpaste that you use in the morning to clean your mouth, to brus h your teeth. The toothpaste is made by a certain company. The name would be the  brand of that toothpaste. Often that same brand, that same name, will be used  with the whole set of products, a “line” of products, we might call them.

“Longevity” (longevity) refers to how long somethin g lasts; usually it refers to a long life or a long existence. Nick is talking abou t Jessica’s brand as having longevity. It will survive for many years. This wil l allow her “to hedge her bets.” “To hedge (hedge) your bets (bets)” means to reduce  your risk, to protect yourself against bad things that might happen in the future. Nick is saying here that if Jessica gives her name to all of these diff erent products, she would make a lot of money now, and then she wouldn’t perhaps h ave to worry about making money in the future.

Jessica says, “You mean in the future when I’m no l onger as famous or as popular?” Nick says, “No, of course that’s not what  I mean.” Jessica is concerned that sometime in the future, she won’t be popular. Nick doesn’t want her to think that – doesn’t want her to think that Nick believes  that someday she won’t be popular. Of course, we all know that eventually cel ebrities lose their popularity, are no longer popular.

Nick says, “You’ll be a star forever,” meaning you will be famous forever. “But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is good?” There are two expressions here. The first one is “a piece of the pie” or “to get a piece of the pie” (pie). “To get a piece of the pie” here refers to g et part of something, to obtain a part of something, often some amount of money. And that’s what Nick is talking about here. A “pie” is normally a dessert that you eat, but here it’s referring simply to getting some money that is available to b e got.

The second expression is “while the getting is good .” “While the getting (getting) is good” means to get something before it disappear s – to get something while

there is still an opportunity to get it. Jessica sa ys, “I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are we talking about?” “Merchandise” (m erchandise) are products, things that you can buy, things that are sold by co mpanies. “Merchandise” usually refers to physical products. Jessica wants to know what kind of merchandise Nick is talking about.

Nick says “We can start with a clothing line, and t hen branch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.” A “clothing line” would be clothes that are sold under a particular name – shi rts, pants, dresses, that sort of thing. The phrasal verb “to branch (branch) out” me ans to go into a different area, a different kind of, in this case, product from the  one that you started with. A celebrity might start with selling shirts that have  his name on it, and then he could branch out and sell pants and shoes and socks and o ther types of clothing. That would be “branching out.”

Nick is suggesting that Jessica can branch out into  all sorts of things after she starts selling clothing. One of the things you can start selling in the future is “weight-loss” products. “Weight loss” refers to bec oming thinner, losing some of the weight that you have, not being as fat as you a re now. I mean, I’m not saying you’re fat – you, who are listening to this episode  – but you know, people in general. Americans have this problem. Jessica says,  “What are you implying?” She thinks that Nick is calling her fat, and of cou rse, you never want to call a woman fat.

Nick says, “I’m not implying anything,” meaning I’m  not saying that you are overweight. “I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I mean” – and then he changes his idea – “food – glamorous, beautiful food. See w hat I mean?” – meaning “Do you understand me?” – “The sky’s the limit!” The ex pression “the sky’s (sky’s) the limit” means that there are many, many possibilitie s – many things that you can do. There are no limits. There are no restrictions.  You have a lot of choices, usually good choices.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
