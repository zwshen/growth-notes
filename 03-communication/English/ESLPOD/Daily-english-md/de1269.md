This episode is a dialogue between Dan and Janice a bout problems with a heating system – the thing that keeps your house wa rm. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

[Doorbell rings]

Dan: Hello, I’m Dan. I’m here to fix your heating s ystem.

Janice: Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’ t expect a repairperson to come out the same day.

Dan: I just finished another repair in the neighbor hood and the company told me to come by. How long has it been on the fritz?

Janice: Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for two mont hs. We used it to heat the basement.

Dan: But you just called for repairs today.

Janice: I didn’t call about the boiler. I called ab out our radiators. The radiators heat the original part of the house. But we’re also  having problems with the furnace for our central heating system, which heats  the extension.

Dan: You mean you have two different heating system s in one house?

Janice: It’s an old house. Each system was installe d at a different time.

Dan: So you could have problems with more than one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.

 Janice: I know that we should install one system for the whole house, but that would be expensive.

Dan: More expensive than fixing two separate system s?

Janice: Is this going to cost a lot?

Dan: I’m afraid so.

Janice: Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs. I guess we’ll have to use these.

Dan: What are those?

Janice: Space heaters.

Dan rings the doorbell, which we hear at the beginn ing of the dialogue. A “doorbell” is something that makes noise to indicat e that someone is at your door and wants you to open it. Dan says, “Hello, I’m Dan . I’m here to fix your heating system.” Dan is talking to Janice, who has, of cour se, opened the door. A “heating system” refers to all of the equipment and  technology used to control the temperature in your house or in a building.

We sometimes talk about a “heating and cooling syst em.” In some places, it gets very hot, and so you want what is called “air condi tioning,” which puts cool air into your house. If it’s cold, you want heating so that your house is warm. My house just has a heating system. I don’t have a coo ling system. My cooling system is opening the windows.

In our dialogue, Dan is there to fix the heating sy stem. Janice says, “Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’t expect a repairpe rson to come out the same day.” A “service call” is when someone comes to your hous e to fix something that is wrong. It could be your plumbing, it could be your electricity, or in this case, your heating system.

Janice “didn’t expect a repairperson.” A “repairper son” (or a “repairman” or “repairwoman”) is a person who fixes something brok en in your house or perhaps in another building. Usually if you have an electri cal or mechanical device in your house that doesn’t work, such as a washer or a refr igerator, you can call a

repairperson to come and fix it. That person will “ come out,” meaning they will go to your house.

Dan says, “I just finished another repair” – that i s, I just fixed someone else’s machine in the same neighborhood, “and the company told me to come by.” “To come by” means to go to someone’s, in this case, ho use. Dan says, “How long has it been on the fritz?” The expression “on the f ritz” (fritz) means not working correctly, or working in a way that you don’t like or that is not acceptable to you. If your television is “on the fritz,” it isn’t working , or at least it isn’t working the way you want it to work.

Janice says, “Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for tw o months.” A “boiler” (boiler) is something that some homes and buildings have in ord er to provide heat. A “boiler” actually heats up water. The water turns i nto vapor or steam, and that vapor or steam is sent through certain pipes or tub es that go into the house or the building that warm the surrounding air. These p ipes or tubes usually are in each room. They are put together and called a “radi ator” (radiator). My house back in Minnesota, where I grew up, had a boiler an d radiators. It’s an older system of heating houses and buildings. The school I went to also had a very large boiler and radiators in each classroom.

Janice says the boiler in her house “hasn’t worked for two months.” She says, “We used it to heat the basement.” A “basement” (ba sement) is a level or floor of a building that is below the ground. In many parts of the United States, such as in the Midwest and in the east, the houses often have basements a level below the ground. Here in California, most houses do not have  basements.

Dan is a little confused because Janice says the bo iler hasn’t worked for two months. He says, “But you just called for repairs t oday.” Janice clarifies. She says, “I didn’t call about the boiler. I called abo ut our radiators.” I explained what radiators are, of course. “Radiators heat the original part of the house.” So  it looks like, or sounds like, Janice has an old part of a house and a new part of  her house.

She says, “We’re also having problems with the furn ace for our central heating system, which heats the extension.” Another way of heating your house, more common nowadays, is through what is called a “furna ce” (furnace). A furnace is a large piece of equipment that burns wood, natural g as, or oil to heat up the air that is used to heat the home.

A boiler heats water, which then becomes steam that  is sent through these pipes into the radiators which heat the air around it. A “furnace” heats the air itself and

then takes that air and moves it throughout the hou se so that the air is warm in different parts of the house. Technically, then, th ey are different ways of heating a house, although when I was growing up, we often r eferred to the boiler as the furnace without distinguishing between the two, but  there is a difference.

Janice says that the new part of her house – the ex tension – is heated with a furnace. An “extension” (extension) is a part of a house that is added after the original house is built. Here in Los Angeles, it’s very common for houses to have extensions in the back because people want more roo m. Janice mentions that they have a central heating system in the new part of their house.

A “central heating system” refers to a set of equip ment that sends heat throughout the entire house. Most houses have a cen tral heating system, at least most large houses where a furnace is used to heat u p the air which is then sent throughout the house to heat it up. There are some older houses that don’t have a central heating system. They have a little heatin g system in every room.

I used to live in a small house that had one heater  in the middle of the house, and that was supposed to heat all of the rooms of t he house. So you had to keep the doors open in order to have the heat go into the different rooms. That wasn’t really a central heating system. Central heating sy stems usually move the air through the house using fans that blow the air from  one part of the house to the other.

In any case, Janice is having problems with the fur nace in their central heating system. She says they’re having problems not only w ith the radiators that are part of the boiler system, but also with the furnac e for the extension. Dan says, “You mean you have two different heating systems in  one house?”

Janice explains, “It’s an old house. Each system wa s installed at a different time.” “To install” (install) means to connect a new piece  of equipment or to put in a new piece of equipment. We often use this verb “to inst all” when we’re talking about a piece of equipment, mechanical or electrical, that is connected to something else and becomes a more or less permanent part of a hous e or a building. So we might talk about “installing” a security camera or a set of cameras in different parts of your house. Here we’re talking about insta lling heating systems.

Dan says, “So you could have problems with more tha n one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.” Dan is listing, conveniently, different parts of a heating system. A “thermostat” (thermostat) is a sm all device that you use to set the temperature that you want in your house. It’s h ow you turn the heater on and off, or turn the air conditioner on and off. A ther mostat has a thermometer which

tells you what the temperature is inside of a room,  and you can change it, turning the heater on or off depending on whether you want more or less heat.

A “heating element” is something that becomes hot t hrough the use of electricity, and that electricity creates heat. Heating elements  are actually not used typically in either a boiler or a furnace system. A heating e lement would be used in an electric heater. Some people have, in addition to a  heating system in their houses, electric heaters that they put in individua l rooms when they want just one room to be warmer than another. Those electrical he aters have heating elements that get hot because the electricity is going throu gh them, and that creates hot air around the heating element.

A “fan” (fan) is something that moves air. A furnac e system has hot air which is then moved by fans to different parts of the house from the furnace to the rooms where you need the heat. An electric heater also us es typically a fan, although not all do. Finally, we have the word “ductwork” (d uctwork). “Ductwork” refers to the tubes or passages that go from the furnace to t he individual rooms of the house through which the hot air goes.

So, if you walk into a house and you see, usually o n the ceiling, an opening that has metal bars over it, that’s probably connected t o a duct. Those “ducts” are basically big tubes that are connected to the furna ce. The furnace sends the hot air through those ducts into the individual rooms. If you see, on the other hand, metal radiators, either by the floor or against the  wall, that house has a boiler system.

Janice says, “I know that we should install one sys tem for the whole house, but that would be expensive.” Dan says, “More expensive  than fixing two separate systems?” Janice doesn’t really answer the question . Instead, she asks another question, “Is this going to cost a lot?” meaning is  what Dan is going to do today to fix these two systems going to cost a lot of money?

Dan says, “I’m afraid so.” “I’m afraid so” is anoth er way of saying, believe it or not, yes. “I’m afraid so” means “Yes, I am sorry to  say that this is true.” Janice says, “Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs.” “E xpensive” means costing a lot of money. “I guess we’ll have to use these.” Dan sa ys, “What are those?”

Janice says, “Space heaters.” Space heaters are wha t I was describing previously. These are little machines that have hea ting elements in them, that you plug into the wall so that the electricity heat s up the heating elements and you can heat up a small area or a small room. If yo u have lots of space heaters, I

 suppose you could heat up a big room. We used to us e space heaters all the time in my old house where we didn’t have a central  heating system.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
