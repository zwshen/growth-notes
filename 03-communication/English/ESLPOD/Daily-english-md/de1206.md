This episode is a dialogue between Emma and Ricardo  about doing things I never do – outdoor sports and activities – while on  vacation. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: Are you ready?

Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I  thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.

Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead .

Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.

Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zi p-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.

Ricardo: I thought the point of this vacation was t o rest and recharge.

Emma: We do need to recharge, but what we need is e xcitement, not rest. Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorro w.

Ricardo: Why? What are we doing tomorrow?

Emma: How about a watersport, maybe kayaking, winds urfing, or water skiing? Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do som e snorkeling.

Ricardo: I like the idea of spending some time on t he water, but whale watching is more my speed.

Emma: Don’t you want to feel the wind through your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?

Ricardo: I didn’t know you were such an adrenaline junkie.

Emma: Guilty as charged. I’m going to take skydivin g lessons next month. Want to join me?

Ricardo: I consider skydiving a spectator sport!

There are two kinds of people in the world. There a re those who like going outdoors and doing things, and then there are those  who like being indoors and doing things that don’t require being in the sun or  getting bitten by mosquitoes. I am one of the latter – that is, I am one of those w ho doesn’t really like being outdoors. But many people do like being outdoors, a nd so we’ll talk today about outdoor sports and activities, especially the sorts  of things that people do on their vacation, or so I am told.

Our dialogue begins with Emma saying, “Are you read y?” Ricardo says, “Sure, but why are you dressed like that?” Ricardo can’t u nderstand the way in which Emma is dressed, the clothing she has on. Ricardo s ays, “I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.” “Golf” ( golf) is a game in which players hit a small white ball with a long metal st ick called a “club” (club). My father loved golfing. He used to go golfing two or three times a week after he retired from his job, when he was older.

Emma says, “I told them,” meaning Kareem and Karen,  “we’re going rock climbing instead.” “Rock climbing” is a sport that involves going up a rock wall, or a side of a large rock, usually with ropes and othe r instruments for safety. Some people go rock climbing on the side of a mountain o r a large rock, say, in the middle of the desert, which you can do here in Sout hern California. Other people go rock climbing on a wall where it isn’t actually a rock you’re climbing on, but rather a wall that is made to look like a big rock.

I tried going rock climbing once. I was trying to i mpress a beautiful girl – the sister of a woman I was working with at the time. This was , oh, 25 years ago. I absolutely hated it and I wasn’t very good at it. T he girl was much better than I

was and, well, I never saw her again. Anyway, rock climbing is what Emma is planning on doing.

Ricardo says, “I was really looking forward to a ga me of golf.” “To look forward to” something is to anticipate something in the sen se that you want to do it. “I’m looking forward to having a glass of wine this afte rnoon.” I really want to have a glass of wine. Thinking about it makes me happy. Th at would be what Ricardo is doing here. He’s “looking forward,” or “was looking  forward,” to a game of golf.

Emma says, “You play golf all the time. How often d o we get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining.” “Horseback (horseback) riding” is when you get on top of a hor se and go with the horse, usually at a slow speed, but sometimes at a fast sp eed, depending on how good you are at riding a horse. I have never been horseb ack riding. I’m kind of scared of the idea of getting on top of a horse. Maybe I s hould try a donkey or some animal that moves a little more slowly.

Emma mentions horseback riding and “zip-lining.” “Z ip (zip) – lining (lining)” is an activity in which you are attached, you are connect ed, to a long cable (cable) – a metal rope, you can think of it as – that is high u p in the air, and you actually ride, if you will, on this cable. You go down the cable, often over a beautiful area out in nature. I, of course, have never been zip-lining. I t looks like fun. Maybe someday I’ll try it.

Emma says, “We can do both this afternoon if you’re  for it.” “To be up for” something is to be ready to do something, especiall y something that might be a little difficult or challenging. Ricardo says, “I t hought the point,” the reason, “of this vacation was to rest and recharge.” “To rechar ge” means to get your energy back, to make you feel like you can do something ag ain, to make you feel as though you are ready to go back to work, for exampl e. Many people go on vacation to “recharge,” to get their energy back by  relaxing and doing things that are fun.

Emma says, “We do need to recharge, but what we nee d is excitement, not rest.” Some people go on vacation to rest. Some people go on vacation to do things that are exciting. Emma wants to do something that is exciting. She says, “Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorrow.” Ri cardo asks, “Why? What are we doing tomorrow?” Emma says, “How about a water s port?” A “water sport” is an activity that takes place in, of course, the wat er.

Emma mentions some water sports, including “kayakin g,” “windsurfing,” and “water skiing.” “Kayaking” (kayaking) is going out in a little boat called a “kayak”

that is designed for one person. “Windsurfing” (win dsurfing) is the sport of riding on a small surfboard that has a sail attached. A “s ail” (sail) is a flat piece of material or cloth that is able to use the wind to h elp you move forward. Windsurfing involves going fast on the water on a s urfboard, a special kind of surfboard called a “sailboard.”

Another water sport Emma mentions is “water skiing”  (skiing). Normally we think of “skiing” as something you do in the wintertime o r in a cold place where there is snow. You move fast down a hill or a mountain. That  would be “downhill skiing.” “Water skiing” is when you have skis and are being pulled by a boat and you move across the water, holding on to a rope that is  attached to a boat. I have never gone water skiing or windsurfing or kayaking.  I’m not really much interested in water sports.

Emma continues, “Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do some snorkeling.” “Scuba (scuba) diving (diving)” involv es going under water while using some special equipment that allows you to bre athe underwater. You have what’s called an “oxygen tank” (tank) on your back,  and that allows you to breathe for a long time while you are underwater.

“Snorkeling” (snorkeling) is swimming just below the surface of the water. Your face is in the water but you are breathing through a special “tube” (tube), that is above the water and allows you to keep your face un derwater while being able to breathe. Have I ever gone scuba diving or snorkelin g? Of course not. I’m back at the hotel reading and having a drink.

Ricardo continues, “I like the idea of spending som e time on the water, but whale watching is more my speed.” “Whales” (whales) are l arge mammals in the ocean. “Whale watching” is when you go out on a boat and l ook for whales in the ocean. You can do that here in Southern California, althou gh I have never gone on a boat whale watching, myself. Ricardo says whale wat ching is more his “speed” (speed). The expression “more his speed” means more  interesting to him – something that is a better match for his interests and his level of energy.

Emma says, “Don’t you want to feel the wind through  your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?” Emma is des cribing the experience that Ricardo can have if he goes windsurfing. She s ays Ricardo can feel the excitement “pumping (pumping) through his veins (ve ins).” “To have something pumping through your veins” means to, in this case,  be filled with excitement, that makes your body feel the excitement.

Your “veins” are the parts of your body that move b lood back and forth – your veins and your arteries. We use the verb “to pump” to describe the action the heart goes through in moving blood around the body,  and therefore “pumping through your veins” describes the heart being so ex cited, pumping so much, that the blood is moving through your body more quickly.

Ricardo says, “I didn’t know you were such an adren aline junkie.” An “adrenaline (adrenaline) junkie (junkie)” is a person who enjoy s excitement, who gets energy from sometimes dangerous activities. Emma says yes,  she is. But instead of just saying “yes,” she says, “Guilty as charged.” The ex pression “Guilty (guilty) as charged (charged)” is used to say that you agree wi th what someone says about you, but it’s a funny way of saying it because norm ally “to be guilty” of something is to have done something wrong.

Emma doesn’t think she’s done anything wrong. She’s  just trying to be funny when she says “Guilty as charged.” She says, “I’m g oing to take skydiving lessons next month.” “Skydiving” (skydiving) is the  rather insane activity of jumping out of an airplane and then opening up what  is called a “parachute” (parachute). A “parachute” is a large piece of mate rial that allows you to move down towards the ground slowly, so you don’t kill y ourself. That’s “skydiving.”

Emma says, “Want to join me?” Ricardo answers, “I c onsider skydiving a spectator sport!” A “spectator” (spectator) is some one who watches a sporting event or activity. A “spectator sport,” then, would  be a sport you would only want to watch, you wouldn’t want to participate in. Rica rdo thinks that skydiving is a “spectator sport,” meaning he doesn’t want to do it  himself. He thinks it’s too dangerous. And frankly, I agree with Ricardo.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
