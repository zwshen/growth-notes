On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Sandra and Antonin about breaching or breaking a contract, an official  agreement between two people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: I don’t know what to do. Our contractor ins talled the wrong equipment and now we’re having major problems. I’ve tried con tacting her, but she’s dodging my calls. The trouble is I’ve already paid her in full.

Antonin: Well, that’s a breach of contract. Your on ly recourse might be to take her to court.

Sandra: I’d hate to do that. I’d rather settle this  out of court.

Antonin: I don’t blame you, but if she’s hiding out  or has washed her hands of this whole situation, suing her might be the only way to  compel her to fix the problem.

Sandra: We’ve already suffered major damage as a re sult of her mistakes.

Antonin: Then that’s all the more reason to see you r attorney. You’ll need to go to court to collect damages.

Sandra: Aren’t you an attorney? Couldn’t you help u s?

Antonin: I’m a divorce attorney. I can only help yo u if you’re married to your contractor.

I want to start this episode by apologizing a littl e bit for my voice today. It seems to be a little “hoarse” (hoarse). When your voice i s “hoarse,” you sound like this. You sound as though perhaps you’ve been using your voice too much. Maybe screaming at the television, as I was doing last ni ght when the Dodgers were playing – my favorite baseball team, of course.

Anyway, this episode is not about voices or basebal l. It’s about breaching a contract. A “contract” (contract) is a legal agreem ent between two people or two organizations – we usually use the term “parties” ( parties). This isn’t the kind of party where you go drinking and dancing. The term “ party” in legal English, if you will, refers to two people or groups that are part of some sort of official contract or agreement.

Sandra begins by saying, “I don’t know what to do. Our contractor installed the wrong equipment and now we’re having major problems .” Your “contractor” (contractor) is a person who you have a contract wi th, but who specifically works on construction projects. Building a house, or perh aps putting in a new bathroom, putting on a new roof – these would all be projects  that a contractor would work on.

The contractor “installed the wrong equipment,” acc ording to Sandra. “To install” (install) means to take a piece of equipment, in th is case, and make sure that it is working properly, connecting it to the other parts of whatever it is it is being connected to. So, for example, if you buy a new sto ve for cooking, the contractor would install your stove, would put it in the right  place, connect the gas to it or the electricity that it needed, and so forth.

We use this verb “to install” also when we’re talki ng about software – computer programs that you put on your computer or your iPho ne, Android phone, tablet, whatever it is you have. Sandra says, “I’ve tried c ontacting her” – “her” being the contractor – “but she’s dodging my calls.” There ar en’t a lot of female contractors even today, but Sandra apparently found one. She tr ied contacting her, but the contractor is “dodging my calls.” “To dodge” (dodge ) means to avoid someone or something, to find a way not to deal with someone.

The contractor is dodging her calls. She’s not answ ering her phone or returning her calls. Sandra says, “The trouble is I’ve alread y paid her in full.” “To pay someone in full” (full) means to give them 100 perc ent of the money you owe them. Sometimes, with contractors who work at your house, you give them, say,

 percent before they start working and then the r est of it when they finish the job. Well, Sandra has already paid this contractor “in full” – 100 percent.

Antonin says, “Well, that’s a breach of contract.” A “breach” (breach) here means a breaking of – when someone doesn’t follow the con tract. The legal expression would be a “breach of contract.” He says, “Your onl y recourse might be to take her to court.” A “recourse” (recourse) is something  you do in a difficult or challenging situation, but it isn’t really somethin g you want to do. It isn’t your first choice.

“Recourse” is another word you will mostly hear in some sort of legal discussion or read about in something that is talking about le gal issues. A “recourse” is something that you can do in order to try to get ou t of a situation. “To take someone to court” (court) means to go to the govern ment and complain in the hopes of getting your money back. To take someone t o court is “to sue” (sue) them – to go to a judge and say, “This person broke  the contract” – breached the contract – “and I want my money back.”

Sandra says, “I’d hate to do that.” She doesn’t wan t to do that. “I’d rather settle this out of court.” “To settle” (settle) something means to solve some problem, to take care of some difficult situation. “Out of cour t” means without going to the government, without going to the judge and asking h im to take care of the situation. “To settle something out of court” means  to take care of it on your own, without involving the government at all.

Antonin says, “I don’t blame you.” “To blame” (blam e) someone is to say that they did something wrong, to say that they are resp onsible for some problem. However, when someone says, “I don’t blame you,” he ’s saying I understand why you’re doing what you’re doing, even though I don’t  completely agree with it. Antonin says, “I don’t blame you, but if she’s hidi ng out or has washed her hands of this whole situation, suing her might be the onl y way to compel her to fix the problem.”

Lots of expressions in that sentence – let’s start with “she’s hiding out.” “To hide (hide) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that really means the same as “to hide.” It means to stay away from other people and not allow yourself to be found. Usually we use this phrasal verb when we’re talking  about someone who has done something wrong and doesn’t want the police or  anyone else finding him.

“To wash your hands of something” means to say that  you are not going to get involved or you are not accepting responsibility for a situation. Those of you familiar with the Christian Bible will remember the  famous scene of Pontius Pilate

washing his hands of the situation involving Jesus.  Well, that’s probably one of the origins – if not the origin – of this expressio n “to wash your hands of” something. It means to indicate that you’re not going to have anything to do with it. You’re not going to get involved in this situat ion.

Antonin says that suing the contractor “might be the only way to compel her to fix the problem.” We already mentioned the verb “to sue ,” which is to take someone to court. “To compel” (compel) someone means to mak e someone do something. To say here, “You have to do it now.” Sandra says, “We’ve already suffered major damage as a result of her mistakes.” She’s sa ying that they’ve already had a lot of problems, that they have actually had dama ge done to their house.

Antonin says, “Then that’s all the more reason to s ee your attorney.” The expression “all the more reason” is a little unusua l, but you will hear that in English or read it. It means an even better reason or motivation for doing something – when you give someone a reason to do so mething and then you want to give them an additional reason. Usually it’ s something the other person has said that you agree would be another good reaso n for doing something. You would say, “All the more reason to do it.”

For example, if your friend wants to ask a girl out  on a date, – ask her to go to dinner with him – you might say to him, “Well, she’ s very beautiful. You should ask her out.” And your friend says to you, “And I h eard she just broke up with her boyfriend.” You might say, “Well, all the more reas on to ask her out, now that she doesn’t have a boyfriend anymore.”

It’s a little dangerous asking them out if they hav e boyfriends. Be careful about that, guys. I know.

Anyway, Antonin says, “all the more reason to see y our attorney” (attorney). Your “attorney” is your lawyer, the person who has studi ed law and represents people and then takes all of your money. Antonin says, “Yo u’ll need to go to court to collect damages.” “To collect damages” means to get  money back from someone who has hurt you, or has done something wrong, or i n this case has “breached a contract.”

Sandra says, “Aren’t you an attorney. Couldn’t you help us?” Antonin says, “I’m a divorce attorney.” Attorneys often specialize in on e kind of law. Antonin says he doesn’t do this kind of law – the kind that Sandra would need. Instead, he’s a “divorce (divorce) attorney.” A “divorce” is a lega l end to your marriage. He helps people get divorced, we would say. So he’s not goin g to be a lot of help in this situation.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
