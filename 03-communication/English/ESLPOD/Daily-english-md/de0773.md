[start of dialogue]

Kristin:  Let’s go shopping!

Ed:  Wait a second.  What are all these?

Kristin:  They’re bills, but they don’t have to be paid yet.  Don’t worry.  Let’s go! There’s a new pair of shoes with my name on it.

Ed:  Hold on a minute.  This is a notice saying tha t you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will  go into foreclosure.

Kristin:  Oh, they’re just bluffing.  I’m only a li ttle behind in my payments.  I’ll get to it next week.

Ed:  And this is a notice from your bank telling yo u that your car is being repossessed because you haven’t made a car payment in three months.  Is that true?

Kristin:  I refuse to look at anything as boring as  a bill today.

Ed:  And these are from the power company and the p hone company.  They’re going to cut off your services if you don’t pay now .

 Kristin:  If I could just charge those payments, I’ d be okay.

Ed:  Not with these credit cards.  You’re maxed out .  I’m surprised you haven’t heard from collection agencies already.

Kristin:  Maybe I have.  They can hound me all they  want, but I’m not that  behind on my payments.  I’m tired of waiting.  I’m going s hopping with or without you.

Ed:  You’re on your own.  I refuse to help you towa rd your financial ruin!

Our dialogue begins with Kristin saying to Ed, “Let ’s go shopping!”  Let’s go buy some things.  Ed says, “Wait.  What are all these?”   He’s looking at something. Kristin says, “They’re bills, but they don’t have to be paid yet.”  “Bills” (bills – the singular is “bill”) are statements saying how much money you owe a company. Usually when you have some sort of service, the com pany that is giving you the service – or the product – sends you a bill.  You can have a gas bill, an electric bill, a telephone bill; you have to usually pay the se every month.  Kristin says these bills that Ed is looking at don’t have to be paid yet.  “Don’t worry,” she says, “Let’s go!  There’s a new pair of shoes with my nam e on it.”  The expression “there’s (something) with your name on it” is used to describe something that you want to have very badly; you have plans to buy it.  So for example if I was going to buy a new car, I might say, “Oh, there’s a Mazda  Miata with my name on it,” or, “There’s a Ford pickup truck with my name on it ,” meaning those are things that I want to buy.  Of course, it doesn’t actually  have your name on it; you’re saying that that is something that you are going to  get.

Ed says, “Hold on a minute.  This is a notice (this  is a letter) saying that you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will go into foreclosure.”  “To be behind on (something)” m eans to be late, not to be doing something as you had scheduled.  “I’m behind on my accounting.”  I was supposed to finish my accounts last week and I’m st ill working on it.  “I’m behind on my bills” means the bills were supposed to be pa id last month and I haven’t paid them yet.  In this case, Kristin is behind on her house payments.  When you buy a house in the United States, usually you get a  loan from the bank – you borrow money from the bank, they lend you money – a nd then you have to, of course, pay the loan back every month.  That’s what  “house payments” are.  Ed says that the notice says that the house payments of Kristin are behind schedule, and that her house may go into foreclosure.  “Forec losure” (foreclosure) is what happens when you don’t pay your loan back to the ba nk.  If you take a long time,

and you don’t give the bank their money every month , the bank can come and take your house from you because you haven’t paid the loan back.  This, unfortunately, has happened a lot here in the Unite d States in the last few years.

Kristin says, “Oh, they’re just bluffing.”  “To blu ff” (bluff) means to say something, to say that you’re going to do something bad, but y ou don’t really mean it.  You’re not serious; you won’t actually do that.  Sometimes  we use the verb “bluff” when we’re playing cards, a card game like poker.  You s ay that you have something, but you don’t actually have anything.  You’re bluff ing; you’re lying, basically.  So, “to bluff” can be to lie, or “to bluff” can be to t hreaten to do something bad but not be serious about it, not actually intend to do it.  Kristin says, “I’m only a little behind in my payments.  I’ll get to it next week.”  “I’ll get to it” means I will take care of it, I will handle it later.

Ed – who for some reason is looking through Kristin ’s mail, I’m not sure why – sees another letter – another piece of paper – that  is a notice from Kristin’s bank telling her that her car is being repossessed.  “To  repossess” is similar to a foreclosure; the bank comes and takes back what it gave you or what you borrowed money to buy – the bank didn’t give it to you, but the bank gave you the money to buy the house or buy the car.  Now for  a house, when the bank comes and says we’re taking your house from you, th at’s called a “foreclosure.” When it’s anything else, like a car or maybe you bo rrowed money to buy furniture or whatever it is, we call it “repossession.”  “To possess” means to own or to have something.  “To repossess” means to take somet hing from someone else, usually someone who has borrowed money from you.  T here was a movie many years ago called the Repo Man  (repo).  “Repo” stands for repossess.  Usually, we talk about this verb when dealing with someone’s  car, when they borrow money for a car and they don’t pay their loan.  Ed says that Kristin’s car is being repossessed because she hasn’t made a car payment in three months. Remember we talked about house payments, money you pay to the bank every month for the loan that you have; that loan is call ed a “mortgage” when you by a house.  Well, this is a car loan, and for car loans  you have car payments; you pay the bank every month for the loan they gave you to buy your car.  Ed says, “Is that true?”

Kristin says, “I refuse to look at anything as bori ng as a bill today.”  She thinks that her bills are not interesting; they’re boring,  so she’s just not going to look at them.  Ed continues to go through Kristin’s mail.  He says, “these (these letters) are from the power company and the phone company.”  The power company is the company you buy your electricity from.  Usually  there’s just one power company for a given area.  Sometimes the local gove rnment owns the power company, but in many places a private company has the contract to give

everyone electricity.  A phone company is always, a t least in the U.S., a private company that provides you with telephone service.  Ed says that the power company and the phone company are going to cut off Kristin’s services if she doesn’t pay her bills.  “To cut off your services” means to stop giving you what you were paying for – or what you haven’t paid for,  in this case.  So, to cut off your power, to cut off your phone service, that’s w hat will happen if you don’t pay your bills.

Kristin says, “If I could just charge those payment s, I’d be okay.”  “To charge” (charge) means to use a credit card to pay a bill.  You don’t have the cash – the money, so you use a credit card, a Visa or a Master Card, to pay the bill.  The word “charge” also has some other meanings in Engli sh; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Ed says that Kristin can ’t charge the bills; he says, “Not with these credit cards.  They’re maxed out.”  “To max (max) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to use the most you possi bly can of something. “Max” is short for “maximize,” it’s related to the word “maximum,” the most of something.  Well, to max out your credit cards mean s to use all of your credit. The bank usually gives you maybe 1,000 or 2,000 or 5,000 dollars that you can spend with your credit card, but then it says okay,  no more.  Well, Kristin has maxed out her credit cards; she can’t use them anym ore until she pays her bills.

Ed says, “I’m surprised you haven’t heard from coll ection agencies already.”  A “collection agency” is a company that helps other c ompanies get their money from customers who don’t pay.  So if you have a cel l phone and you don’t pay your bill, after a few months another company – a c ollection agency – might call you and say hey, we want the money.  Now, they can’ t come and hurt you, but they can do other things that will hurt you financi ally if you don’t pay your bill.

Kristin says, “Maybe I have,” meaning maybe I have heard from collection agencies.  She’s saying that these agencies have pr obably already contacted her.  She says, “They can hound me all they want.”  “To hound (hound) (someone)” means to bother someone, usually by aski ng for something over and over again.  “His wife hounded him about cutting the lawn,” about cutting the grass outside.  Or, “He hounded the employee to fin ish her work.”  To be constantly asking someone.  Well here, we’re talkin g about collection agencies hounding you, calling you, and that’s what collecti on agencies I think will do. They keep calling you until you pay your bill.  Kri stin says, “I’m not that  behind on my payments (meaning I’m not very behind; I’m not that late).  I’m tired of waiting.  I’m going shopping with or without you.”  So Kristin doesn’t want to pay her loans or worry about all of these problems with  her debt, she’s just going to go shopping.

Ed says, “You’re on your own,” meaning you have to do this by yourself, I am not going to go with you.  He says, “I refuse to help y ou toward your financial ruin!” “Ruin” (ruin) is a very bad situation, when you are  completely destroyed, when the worst thing has happened to you.  Financial rui n is when you don’t have any money anymore; you don’t have any way of getting mo ney.  You have maxed out all your credit cards, you’re house is in foreclosu re, your car has been repossessed; we might call that “financial ruin.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
