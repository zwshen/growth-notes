# Taking a Standardized Test

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 842: Taking a Standardized Test 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 842. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between a father and his d aughter, Maria, about having to take certain kinds of tests in school, what are called “standardized tests.” Let’s get started! 

[start of dialog] 

Dad:  It’s time you start preparing for the MCFL Te st. 

Maria:  Dad, that’s 12 months away! I don’t need to  start looking at test prep materials right now. 

Dad:  Yes, you do. Like all high-stakes testing, fa miliarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you. You need t o score well on it if you want to be admitted to a good university. The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d better be prepared when the time com es. 

Maria:  I don’t really believe in standardized test s. Our teacher says that they don’t really measure how well you’ll do in college or in life. 

Dad:  It doesn’t matter what you – or your teacher – believe. Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s importa nt. Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questio ns. 

Maria:  I know all about taking standardized tests,  Dad. I’ve been taking them every year at school and I’m sick of them. Put your  name here. Bubble in your answer there. I’m sick to death of those tests. 

Dad:  Then you’ll feel perfectly comfortable taking  this one.   

Maria:  Why can’t they give us open-ended or essay questions? I’d do much better on those. 

Dad:  Bite your tongue! Those would be much more di fficult to study for. Ready for question number one? 

Maria:  As ready as I’ll ever be.

Dad begins by saying to Maria, “It’s time you start  preparing for the MCFL Test.” “MCFL” (MCFL) is not a real test. It sounds a littl e like the TOEFL Test, however. Dad says, “It’s time you start preparing.” You need  to start preparing for or working on your MCFL Test. You have to get ready to  take it. Maria says, “Dad, that’s 12 months away.” That’s 12 months from now, when I’ll have to actually take that test. “I don’t need to start looking at t est prep materials right now.” “Test prep” – “prep” stands for preparation – is time spe nt studying a subject that you are going to be tested on. If you’re going to take a math test, you might want to prepare by studying test prep materials about math.  “Test prep” usually refers to taking tests that are official examinations, tests that are, as we’ll see in a moment, “standardized.”  

Dad says, “Yes you do. Like all high-stakes testing , familiarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you.” “High-sta kes” is an expression used for something that is very important, depending on what  happens. If it goes one way, there will be major consequences. It will have sign ificant results. “High-stakes testing” is testing that determines, for example, w hether a student can go to college or not. In some countries, there are nation al examinations and all of the students who want to go to the university have to t ake an exam. That’s an example of a high-stakes test. We have similar exam s here in the United States for college, the most popular being the SAT Exam.  

Dad says that “Familiarity with the types of questi ons you’ll be asked will help you.” “To be familiar” (familiar) means to know abo ut something. So, familiarity is describing how much you know about a certain thing,  how much knowledge you have. Dad is saying that if you understand the kind s of questions on the test, you’ll do better, which is generally true.  

Dad says, “You need to score well on it if you want  to be admitted to a good university.” “To score well” means to do well on an  examination. “I scored well on my math exam.” “I got a good grade.” “I got a good result.” “To score” can also mean to get more points in a game, an athletic comp etition like a soccer game or  

a football game. Maria needs to score well if she w ants to be admitted to a good university. “To be admitted” means to be invited to  be a student there. “The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d  better be prepared when the time comes.” “Administer” means to, in this cas e, offer the examination. It’s a time when you can take the test. The test will be a dministered at 4 o’clock in the auditorium – the big place where people meet. That’ s where the test will be administered. That’s where it will be given.  

Maria says, “I don’t really believe in standardized  tests.” The word “standardized” is in the title of this episode. It refers to exami nations that many different people have taken and that a statistical analysis has been  made so that you know, generally speaking, what percentage of people score  here, what percentage of people score with this amount of points and so fort h. “Standardized tests” are tests that are developed usually by special testing  companies. And they make sure that the tests are all fair, that the test wil l give you the same result if you take it on Monday versus if you take it on Friday. They look at the questions of the tests to make sure that they’re asking what the y’re supposed to be asking and so forth. That’s a standardized test. In the Un ited States, we have lots of standardized tests in our schools. The most popular  one, as I mentioned before, is the SAT – the Scholastic Achievement Test – whic h helps determine whether you are going to go to a university or not. 

Maria says, “Our teacher says that they” – the stan dardized tests – “don’t really measure how well you do in college or in life.” “To  measure” (measure) here means to determine how important something is, to d etermine the value of something. Maria says that her teacher says that st andardized tests don’t really measure how well you do in college or in life. “Mea sure” has a couple of other meanings in English as well. Take a look at our Lea rning Guide for those.  

Maria’s father disagrees with Maria and her teacher . He says, “It doesn’t matter what you or your teacher believe.” “It doesn’t matt er” means it’s not important. He says, “Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s important.” The colleges in universities look at how well you d o on these tests to decide if you are going to get into or be admitted to that co llege.  

Dad says, “Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questions.” A “tip” (tip) is a small piece of advic e about something, how to do something better. A “multiple (multiple) choice (ch oice) question” is a question where you have two or more possible answers, possib le options. You have to select which one is correct. Typically, there are f our or five options on a multiple choice question. With a “true-false” question, you have only two options, either the statement – the sentence – is true or it’s fals e. Minneapolis is the capital of  

Minnesota, true or false? False. St. Paul is the ca pital of Minnesota. That’s a true-false question.  

Maria says, “I know all about taking standardized t ests dad. I’ve been taking them every year at school and I’m sick of them.” “T o be sick of something” means you’re tired of them. You don’t want to have anymore. Maria says, “Put your name here. Bubble in your answer there. I’m si ck to death of those tests.” What Maria is doing is she’s imitating the directio ns, the instructions you get when you take one of these exams. “Put your name he re.” Write your name here. “Bubble in your answer there.” On many standardized  tests, most, perhaps, all standardized tests really; you answer the questions  by filling in little circles with a pencil. This is to “bubble in.” It’s kind of a weir d expression. “Bubble” (bubble) has some other meanings in English as well. Take a look at our Learning Guide for those. But “to bubble in” means to fill in the little circle that indicates what you think the correct answer is for that question. Mari a says, “I’m sick to death of those tests.” “To be sick to death” means the same as to be sick of something. It means you are tired of them. You don’t want to take  them anymore.  

Dad says, “Then you’ll feel perfectly comfortable t aking this one.” He’s saying, “Well, if you’re so familiar with these tests, this  next test won’t be any problem.” Maria says, “Why can’t they give us open-ended or e ssay questions.” An “open- ended question” is a question that doesn’t have jus t one answer. It’s a question that may require a couple of sentences to answer an d that could have a lot of different answers. An “essay (essay) question” is a  question that requires, usually, several paragraphs to answer. “Describe th e three main causes of the Civil War in the United States.” Well, you can’t an swer that in a few words. It would require several paragraphs at least. That’s a n essay question. Standardized tests often don’t have these kinds of questions because a computer cannot easily score them. A computer canno t easily determine which answers you got right or wrong. Someone actually ha s to read the questions and read the answers, more importantly, in order to giv e you a score. 

Dad says, “Bite your tongue.” “To bite (bite) your tongue (tongue)” is simply an expression, meaning to be quiet, to stop talking ab out this. Dad says, “Those would be much more difficult to study for” - “those ” meaning open-ended and essay questions. “Ready for question number one?” D ad says. Dad is going to prepare her for the test. Maria says, “As ready as I’ll ever be.” This is a phrase we use when you are showing that you are willing to  do something but that you probably don’t really want to do it and that you’re  not very well prepared to do it. “As ready as I’ll ever be,” Maria says. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
