This episode is a dialogue between Ralph and Nina a bout architectural styles; that is, the look, the design of houses, how they l ook inside and outside.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ralph:  I just talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some houses tomorrow.  I told her that the bigger t he better and that we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Georgian-style hous e.

Nina:  You did?  I’ve been thinking that we’d try t o find something more modest, a bungalow or a cottage.

Ralph:  What?!  You think I’m going to live in a ho use that’s a step up from a mobile home?  No way.  We’ve come into some money a nd we’re going to buy a big house – maybe a colonial or a Greek revival.

Nina:  If you want something bigger than a bungalow , how about a split-level modern house or maybe a ranch-style house?

Ralph:  You’re still thinking too small.  The sky’s  the limit.  We can afford something big, something really big.

Nina:  That’s what the nouveau riche would do.

Ralph:  So what?  Our money is new and we have a lo t of it, and I want a big house.  We’re not being ostentatious.  If anyone cr iticizes us for that, I’d say, “Deal with it!”

 Our dialogue begins with Ralph saying to Nina, “I j ust talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some homes tomorrow.”  “Real estate” (two words) refers to property – physical property – land and buildings including houses.  An “agent” is someone who sells or buys or  negotiates for you.  A “real estate agent” is someone that helps you either buy or sell your house.  Ralph says that he told the real estate agent the bigger the better; that is, he’s looking for a big house.  When we say “the bigger the bette r” we mean the larger something is the better it is.  That’s not always t rue, but that’s what Ralph wants in his new house.

He says, “we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Geo rgian-style house.”  A “Cape Cod” is a type of home that originally was very pop ular in a certain area in the United States, an area in the state of Massachusett s, which is in the northeast part of the U.S.  Cape Cod, if you look at a map of  the state of Massachusetts, is the thin, you might even call it a “tail” that come s out from the main part of Massachusetts into the Atlantic Ocean.  It’s like a  little...hmm...a little “c” that comes out, that’s called Cape Cod.  A Cape Cod-styl e house usually has one or two floors – two levels, the roof comes to a point,  and there’s often, or usually, a chimney in the center of the house.  A “chimney” is  a tall structure that you use for a fireplace.  When you have a fire with wood or  gas in one of your rooms you need some place for the smoke to go, and it goes up  something called a “chimney.”  So that’s a Cape Cod-style house.  A “G eorgian- (Georgian) style house” is a large, rectangular house, usually two o r three floors, with a door in the center, and many identical rectangular windows that are on each floor.  It’s what we might call a very “symmetrical” looking hou se.  There are windows on both sides and they match, and the distance between  them matches, and so forth.  That’s a Georgian-style house.

Nina says, “You did (meaning you told her we wanted  a big house)?  I’ve been thinking that we’d try to find something more modes t, a bungalow or a cottage.” “Modest” (modest) usually means humble, someone or something without a lot of money.  “Modest” can have a couple of different mea nings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  B ut when we use it to describe, for example, a house, we would mean it’s not a large house, not an expensive looking house.

A “bungalow” (bungalow) is a very small house, usua lly with just one level – one floor.  It has a roof; there’s often a open area in  the front that has a cover on it, what we would call a “porch” (porch).  Many houses in the U.S. have porches. Our house, when I was growing up in Minnesota, had a porch.  It was an “enclosed porch,” meaning there were windows and a door even though it was

outside of the house; it wasn’t heated in the winte rtime.  A “bungalow” is a small, very small little house.  This style of house was v ery popular in California, especially in the 20 th century.  Near where I live, not too far from Santa  Monica, California, there are lots of little bungalows that  you can still find.  Many of them have been destroyed, we would say “torn down,” and replaced by larger houses, but there are still a fair number – a reasonable nu mber of them here in Southern California.

A “cottage” (cottage) is also a small house, usuall y with only one or two bedrooms, and one floor.  Often there are many othe r identical looking houses called “cottages” near it.  Usually, the word “cott age” is used for a small house that is near a lake or perhaps a river, although it  might be in the mountains as well.  Cottages are usually used as vacation housin g; that is, somewhere where you go on the weekend, not the place where you live  the entire year.  The word “cottage” is not as common in California; you will hear the word more often in the Midwest and the East, where there are more lakes an d rivers and perhaps more of these kinds of houses.

Nina, then, wants a smaller house than Ralph.  Ralp h says, “What?!  You think I’m going to live in a house that’s a step up from a mobile home?  No way.”  So, Ralph is saying that he does not want to live in a house that is just a step up from a mobile home.  The expression “to be a step up fro m” means one level higher, slightly better than, an improvement over.  A “mobi le home” is the cheapest, least expensive kind of housing you can have.  It’s a hom e that is made like a big trailer; there are wheels on it, and it is towed by  a truck and put into the place where you are living.  Often there are other mobile  homes very close to you, what we would call a “mobile home park.”  Mobile homes a re housing for people, often times, who don’t have a lot of money; they are chea p housing.  Ralph says that he is not going to live in a house that is just a l ittle better, just a step up from a mobile home.  He says, “We’ve come into some money and we’re going to buy a big house.”  “To come into some money” means to rec eive some money, usually from someone who has died.  We would call that “inh eriting” the money (inheriting).

Well, Ralph and Nina have inherited some money, and  Ralph wants to buy a big house.  “Maybe,” he says, “a colonial or a Greek re vival.”  A “colonial” is a home built in one of the styles that was popular in the United States before we became a country, when we were still a colony.  That’s whe re “colonial” comes from. Usually, a colonial has one or two stories – one or  two floors – two levels, and very steep roofs; that is, roofs that come to a ver y sharp angle.  That’s a colonial house, especially on the East Coast and the Midwest  in the U.S.  Here in the west, especially California, we have something call ed a “Spanish colonial,” which

is different than a eastern colonial house.  A Span ish colonial has usually rounded arches in the side of the house and in the windows.  It is not as sharp; it doesn’t have as many angles.  Even the walls in the  corner of the – of the room are rounded in many Spanish colonial houses.  You f ind a lot of those here in Los Angeles that were built in the early and mid-20 th  century.  “Greek revival” is a house or a building that looks likes sort of classi c ancient Greek architecture, with what we would call “pillars,” large, round columns in the front around the building. Many of the buildings in Washington, D.C. for the U .S. government are built in this sort of classic Greek style.  So, a Greek revi val house would be one like that.

Nina says, “If you want something bigger than a bun galow, how about a split- level modern house or perhaps a ranch-style house?”   A “split-level home” is a home where you walk in and there are two more level s, they’re sort of halfway between being a completely separate level.  One lev el above you is where there are bedrooms, and one level below you is where you will find, say, the living room, the main space in the house.  That’s a split- level house.  A “ranch-style house” is a long, rectangular house, with only one floor.  It has very large windows.  It’s very plain, very simple, not a lot of decoration inside or outside the house.

Ralph says, “You’re still thinking too small.  The sky’s the limit.”  The expression “the sky is the limit” – we put “sky” and “is” toge ther so it becomes “the sky’s the limit” – is a phrase used to show there are no limi ts, no controls.  You can have whatever you want, as expensive and as big as you want.  Ralph says, “We can afford (meaning we have the money for) something bi g, really big.”

Nina says, “That’s what the nouveau riche would do. ”  “Nouveau riche” is a French expression.  And by the way, I always mispro nounce the French expressions; I’m sorry.  Please don’t email me and tell me I’m saying it wrong.  I know I’m saying it wrong.  It’s...uh...just because  I’m not very intelligent; I haven’t figured out French pronunciation yet.  In fact, I m ispronounce all languages really!  Um...so, that’s...uh...that’s what America ns do!  We’re not the smartest people, you have to understand that.  Or maybe it’s  just me!  Anyway, “nouveau riche” in U.S. English means someone who has become  rich, someone who has become wealthy very recently.  The term is often us ed as a criticism, as a negative way of describing people who suddenly get a lot of money and go out and spend a lot of money on things that other peopl e disapprove of, or that show that they have a lot of money.

Ralph says, “So what?  Our money is new and we have  a lot of it, and I want a big house.  We’re not being ostentatious.”  “To be ostentatious” (ostentatious) means to do something or say something just to impr ess other people, especially

when you spend a lot of money.  Rock stars and cele brities are often ostentatious; they like to spend their money on big  cars or jewelry to show other people how much money they have.  Ralph says, “If a nyone criticizes us, I’d say, ‘Deal with it!’”  The expression “deal with it” is an informal expression, slightly rude.  It’s used to tell people that you must accep t or learn to tolerate something because it’s not going to change.  Someone is compl aining about their life; you might, if you are tired of listening to them, say, “Oh, just deal with it!” meaning you just have to make the best of it that you can.  You’re really telling them to stop complaining.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
