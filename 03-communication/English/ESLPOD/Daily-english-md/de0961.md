This episode is a dialogue between Arthur and Marth a about learning how to dance. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Arthur: You know that you’ve taken on an impossible  task, right?

Martha: Teaching you to dance? I’m sure you’re sell ing yourself short.

Arthur: No, really, I have two left feet. I’m compl etely uncoordinated and have no sense of rhythm. I’m just not cut out for dancing.

Martha: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll jus t start by loosening up and swaying to the music. You don’t even need to swing your hips yet.

Arthur: That’s good, because I don’t think I can le arn even the simplest dance steps.

Martha: Not only will I teach you some useful dance  steps, we’ll put together a dance routine down the line.

Arthur: That seems like a pipe dream to me.

Martha: Nonsense. Before long, dancing to you will be as effortless as breathing.

Arthur: But until then, I’ll look and feel like a d ancing hippo!

Our dialogue begins with Arthur saying, “You know t hat you’ve taken on an impossible task, right?” “To take on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to agree to do something that is perhaps going to be v ery difficult – to accept a challenge to do something that will be hard. “I've taken on an impossible task” means I'm trying to do something that will be very difficult, and perhaps even not, or “impossible,” altogether. Arthur makes this into  a question by adding the word “right” at the end and using what is called a “risi ng intonation,” where the voice goes up. “You're going, right?” You are indicating that this is a question, not just a statement.

Martha says, “Teaching you to dance? I'm sure you'r e selling yourself short.” Martha doesn't think teaching Arthur to dance is an  impossible task. She says, “I'm sure” – I'm confident – you are “selling yours elf short.” “To sell yourself short” is a phrasal verb meaning to underestimate your abi lities, to believe that you can't do something that you really can.

Arthur says, “No, really, I have two left feet.” Th is is an old expression. “To have two left feet” means that you are a very bad dancer , that you can't dance very well. Of course, everyone – or most people – have a  left foot and a right foot. If you had two feet that were both left feet, well, yo u probably couldn't walk or dance very well. That's what the expression is sayi ng here.

Arthur says, “I'm completely uncoordinated and have  no sense of rhythm.” “To be uncoordinated” is to be not coordinated. “To be coo rdinated,” then, means to be able to use your body in a way that allows you to b e graceful, to do what you want to do with your body. An athlete, for example,  has to be very coordinated. They have to be able to use their arms and legs and  body together in such a way as to be able to do what they need to do in their s port. Here, Arthur is saying he is “uncoordinated,” meaning he's not able to use hi s body to do what he would need to do to be a dancer.

He says also that he has “no sense of rhythm.” “To have a sense (sense) of” something means to know about something or to have the ability to do something. “Rhythm” (rhythm) is the regular strong points in a song, what we would call the “beats.” Your ability to feel the be ats is a “sense of rhythm.”

For example, a “waltz,” a formal dance – the rhythm  might be ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three, and in a different ki nd of dance it may be ONE- two-three-four, ONE-two-three-four, or one-TWO-thre e-FOUR, one-TWO-three-

FOUR. There are different accents, different strong  points in the music. Having a sense of rhythm is important in dancing, because yo u have to be able to dance according to the rhythm of the song.

Arthur says, “I'm just not cut out for dancing.” the expression “to be cut out for” something means that you are qualified to do someth ing or you are prepared to do something. It can also mean that you have the na tural ability to do something. I am not cut out for camping. It's not something th at I like to do, and it's not something that I want to learn to do, because I don 't think I would be very good at it. I'm not cut out for camping. Arthur is not cut out for dancing.

But Martha says, “Let's not get ahead of ourselves. ” “To get ahead of yourself” means to worry about things that will happen in the  future before you should be worrying about them. It can also mean that you are focusing on what is going to happen later, rather than what you should be doing now. “To get ahead of yourself” would be, for example, to plan your weddi ng before you actually have met anyone to marry. That would be “getting ahead o f yourself.” Although I understand many women do that anyway.

Martha says, “We’ll just start by loosening up and swaying to the music.” “To loosen up” is a phrasal verb meaning to relax, to a llow your body and the muscles in your body to be relaxed, not to be tense . “Sway” (sway) means to move back and forth – once again, to the rhythm or the beat of the music. So, Martha is suggesting that they just relax and move back and forth with the music before they actually start dancing. She says, “You don't even need to swing your hips yet.” “To swing (swing) your hips (hips)” mean s to move your hips back and forth. Your “hips” are the part of your body on the  side of your body, where your leg meets the rest of your body, basically.

Arthur says, “That's good, because I don't think I can learn even the simplest dance steps.” “Dance steps” are the individual move ments or parts of a dance. Martha says, “Not only will I teach you some useful  dance steps, we’ll put together a dance routine down the line.” A “dance r outine” (routine) is a whole series of dance steps that you memorize and are abl e to perform. “Down the line” is an expression meaning later – in the future or e ventually. “Down the line, I hope to retire to Hawaii” – someday in the future. I do . . . maybe someday.

Arthur doesn't believe Martha. He says, “That seems  like a pipe dream to me.” A “pipe (pipe) dream” is a dream about something you want to achieve in the future that is impossible, that will never happen, that is  not something that you will be able to do. That's a “pipe dream.” Martha says, “No nsense,” meaning, “You are wrong. I don't believe what you're saying.” “Nonsen se. Before long” – meaning

soon – “dancing to you will be as effortless as bre athing.” “Something that is “effortless” (effortless) is very easy. You can do it without trying.

Arthur says, “But until then, I'll look and feel li ke a dancing hippo.” Arthur is making a joke here. He says until he learns to danc e, he will look like a hippo that is dancing. A “hippo” (hippo) is short for hippopot amus, which is a large animal with very short legs and a big belly and a big head  that would, of course, look rather funny if it were to dance.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
