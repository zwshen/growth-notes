This episode is called “Hiring a Hitman.”  It’s sort of a funny dialogue about a woman who wants to get rid of someone.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Gus:  Are you Shirley?

Shirley:  Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.  I’m told you’re the best sniper in the business and you can be discreet.  I need a hitman who can do a job, then make himself scarce.

Gus:  I’m your man.  Tell me about it.

Shirley:  There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my side, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.

Gus:  Taking care of problems is my specialty.  I’ll need a down payment now and the balance when I finish him off.  We shouldn’t m eet again, so I’ll tell you later where to make a drop.

Shirley:  All right.

Gus:  Good.  How will I be able to spot the target?

Shirley:  Here’s a picture.  He’s usually in the yard in t he afternoons.

Gus:  You want me to kill a dog?!

 Shirley:  Right, he’s my neighbor’s dog and he keeps me u p every night.  Is that a problem?

Gus:  You bet it is.  Who do you think I am?  People a re disposable, but dogs? They’re a man’s best friend.

Shirley:  Are you kidding me?  You won’t take the job?

Gus:  Nope, I won’t.  If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, then that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!

Our dialogue begins with Gus saying to Shirley, “Are you Shirley?”  They haven’t met before; they’re meeting for the first time.  Shir ley says, “Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.  I’m told you’re the best sn iper in the business and you can be discreet.”  A “sniper” (sniper) is someone who i s very good at using a gun and can shoot people from a far away distance very a ccurately.  So it’s a gunman (someone with a gun), or a gunwoman, who is ver y accurate.  The army and the police might have a sniper.  Shirley says to Gus I heard that, or I’m told that you can be discreet.  “Discreet” means to be able to  keep a secret very quietly, not tell anyone this information, not make your self noticeable.  Someone who is discreet keeps things to themselves – keeps things secr et.

Shirley says, “I need a hitman who can do a job, and the n make himself scarce.” A “hitman” is a person who is paid for killing other pe ople – illegally, of course. They are hired by people to kill other people; that is a hitman.  Shirley says, “I need a hitman who can do a job,” meaning who can get this particular killing done, and “then make himself scarce.”  “To make yourself scarce” is a phrasal verb meaning to disappear quickly, to be difficult to fi nd, to leave a place; that is making yourself scarce.  If somebody says, “Make yourself scarce,”  they mean get out of here, leave.

Gus says, “I’m your man,” a phrase we use to show that you ca n do what the other person wants you to do (someone who is going to hi re you).  For example, if someone says, “I’m looking for someone who is good with  cars,” and you’re a mechanic (you’re a person who fixes cars), you might say, “I’m your man.  You should hire me.”

Shirley says, “There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my sid e, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.”  “A thorn in yo ur side” is something that is very annoying, very unpleasant, something that is painful  and won’t go away.

 Usually we use this expression to talk about a person who b others you or a situation that causes you pain or annoys you somehow.  A “t horn” (thorn) is something that you would find in a plant, or a flower  like a rose.  It’s like a needle, a small stick, that when you touch it, it hurts.  So, a th orn in your side is something that hurts you.  Shirley says that this person – t his someone has been keeping her up at night, meaning not allowing her to  sleep, “and,” she says, “it’s time to take him out.”  “To take someone out” is an in formal expression meaning to kill someone, to murder someone.

Well, this all sounds very serious!  Gus says, “Taking care of problems is my specialty.”  Your “specialty” is something that you do very we ll, something you’re very good at, something that you have made your profession – your job, your expertise.  Well, Gus says that taking care of problems is hi s specialty; in this case, getting rid of people.  He says, “I’ll need a down  payment now and the balance when I finish him off.”  A “down payment” (two  words) is money that you pay before some service is finished; usually it’s a certain pe rcentage of the total cost.  So if you’re going to get your house painted and  it’s going to cost you $4,000, the painter might tell you, “I need a down p ayment of 25%.  You need to pay me $1,000 before I start.”  This is a down payment.  Gus wants a down payment and the balance when he finishes him off.  The  “balance” is, here, the rest of the money that you have to pay someone.  So in t he case of the painter, it would be the other $3,000.  The expression “to finish someone off” also means to kill someone; it’s the same as “taking someone out.”  “To finish off” means, here, just to kill someone.

Gus says, “We shouldn’t meet again, so I’ll tell you later  where to make a drop.” “To make a drop means to put money or something else very valuable in a secret location so that someone else can come and get it later.   This is something you will see in the movies.  For example, if there’s a spy (som eone who is collecting information about another country), the person migh t have someone in that country that is helping them, that is giving them inform ation.  That person inside the country may put the documents or the other informati on in a place, say in a park, and then leave, and then the spy comes and picks up that information.  It can be used to talk about money; it can be used to talk a bout information or something else.

Shirley says, “All right,” meaning okay.  Gus says, “Good.  How will I be able to spot the target?”  “To spot (something)” means to see an d identify, to find something.  If there’s a big crowd of people – lots of people, and you’re looking for one person you might say to your friend, “I can’t spot  her,” and then when you see her you say, “Oh, I’ve spotted her now.”  So it mea ns to look, to see, and identify: say, “Oh, yeah.  That’s the one.”  The “target ” is someone or something

 that you are looking for.  We often use that word when  we are going to attack that thing – we’re going to shoot that thing, that can also  be a target.  “Target” has a couple of different meanings in English, so take a loo k at the Learning Guide for some more explanation on that.

Gus says, “How will I be able to spot the target?”  Shir ley says, “Here’s a picture. He’s usually in the yard in the afternoons.”  The “yard”  here refers to the back or the front of the house where there is grass.  We talk about the “front yard” and the “back yard.”  The front yard is the space in front of your house that is part of your property, and the back yard is the space behind it.

Gus says, “You want me to kill a dog?!”  Shirley has given him a picture of the target, and the target is a dog that she wants to have killed.  Shirley says, “Right, he’s my neighbor’s dog and he keeps me up every night.  Is that a problem?” meaning are you okay with that, does that mean you don’t  want to kill him for me. Gus says, “You bet it is,” meaning yes, it is a problem.  “ Who do you think I am?” meaning what kind of person do you think I am.  “Peop le are disposable, but dogs?  They’re a man’s best friend.”  Something that is “disposable” is something that you can throw it away.  Usually we use this word to t alk about a thing, something you use once and then you throw it away, or som ething that is very inexpensive and cheap.  He says that people are disposable,  meaning well, it’s okay to get rid of people but not dogs.  He says they’re man’s best friend, which is an old expression: “A dog is a man’s best friend.”

Shirley says, “Are you kidding me (are you joking)?  You  won’t take the job (you won’t do it)?”  Gus says, “Nope (which is an informal of  saying no), I won’t.”  He says, “If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, th en that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!”  “To pay good mon ey” here means to spend a lot of money for a specific thing, especially when  someone doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  You may say, “I don’t know why he pays good money to buy that old car.”  You’re saying he’s paying too much money or a lot of money for something that he shouldn’t be paying for.  Gus says, “If you want to pay good money to take out (to kill) a dog, then that’s your prer ogative.”  “Your prerogative” is your choice, your decision.  It’s often used when someone is not in agreement with you; they say, “Well, that’s your prerogative.”  Tha t usually means I don’t agree with your choice, but that’s your choice, you can do  that if you want.

Gus says that he has his standards.  Here, “standards” means rules that you follow that tell you what is right and wrong, what is good and bad.  They are principles or rules that you believe in and you try to fol low in your life.  “Standard” has a couple of meanings in English however, so once again , take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
