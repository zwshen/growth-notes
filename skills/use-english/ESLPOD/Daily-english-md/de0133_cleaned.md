On this podcast, we’re going to go to a wedding. Le t’s go! > I got an invitation in the mail last month that rea lly surprised me. My friend Ulrich was getting married! We went to college together an d he always said that he’d never get married. I guess he found his dream girl in the end.  
> The church wedding was going to be at 3 p.m. and th e reception would start at 7 p.m. at the reception hall.  
> I arrived at the church shortly before 3 p.m. and o ne of the ushers asked me if I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I told him that I was a friend of the groom and he sat me on the left side of the church. I saw  Ulrich standing near the front of the church with the best man, and a few minutes later, the pianist started playing the wedding march. The flower girl and ring  bearer walked down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaid. Then, the bride appeared wearing a beautiful wedding dress, walking with her father who was givi ng her away. The bride and groom exchanged vows and they were married. It was a simple and traditional ceremony. 
> At the reception, there was a lot of champagne. The  best man made a toast that really embarrassed Ulrich, but it was all in good f un. I got a chance to talk to Ulrich and he seemed really happy. In fact, he was trying to set me up with the bridesmaid. I guess it's true. All married people w ant to get all of their friends married. We'll see about that!

Today we go to a wedding. Our story begins by the p erson saying he got an “invitation” in the mail last month. An “invitation ” is, of course, when someone asks you to go to a party or a wedding or some spec ial event. You send an  

invitation. And his friend, Ulrich, was getting mar ried. Now, the two of them knew each other from college. They went to college toget her, or university together, and he said he would never get married – Ulrich sai d that. But, in the story, the narrator, the person telling the story, says, “I gu ess he found his dream girl in the end.” A “dream girl” – two words – (dream) “girl” –  is the most perfect woman for you, the woman that you want to marry. She looks th e way you want her to look and she acts the way you want her to act – that wou ld be your dream girl. He says he found his dream girl in the end. And that e xpression “in the end” means after some time, after some time looking, in this c ase, he found his dream girl.  

The church wedding was going to be at 3 PM. And in the United States, as in many countries, you can be married in a church, or you can be married – what we call a “civil ceremony.” “Civil” is (civil) and a “civil ceremony” means that you are married by someone from the government and that  you are registered officially as “married.” Now, in the United States,  if you are married in a church, by a minister or a priest, or a rabbi or whoever is  the leader – if you are married in a church, you do not need to get married by the government. You do not need a separate ceremony to have your marriage recognize d. The ministers and priests are authorized, you could say, are able to perform a ceremony and it doesn’t need – you don’t need to do an extra one. S o, most people who do a “church ceremony” don’t do a civil ceremony and tho se who do a “civil ceremony” probably won’t do a church ceremony either. 

Well, this is a church wedding, meaning it was goin g to be in a church and the reception – well, the wedding started at 3 P.M. The  reception was going to start at 7 P.M and the “reception” (reception) – that is the party – that’s the party that you have after the wedding ceremony where there’s d ancing and eating and perhaps drinking – that’s a reception and that’s a special word we use for a party after a wedding. You can also have a reception afte r another event and that, sometimes – word, is used sometimes also. The recep tion was going to be at the reception hall. And a “hall” (hall) here means a bi g building with a large – usually a large space where you can put many tables and hav e a – maybe a place for people to dance and food and there are many of thes e reception halls that you can rent for one night and some of them are run by church organizations, some of them are run by community – private community or ganizations. And there are even some governments, some city governments and co unty governments – the city government in the United States, would be, for  example, the city of Los Angeles, but all of the states in the United States  are broken up into larger units – you call them and these are called “counties.” So, the county and city government sometimes has its own places that you ca n rent for a reception.  

In the story, the person arrived at the church shor tly before three, and one of the ushers asked him if he was a friend of the bride or  the groom. An “usher” (usher) – an “usher” is, at a wedding, or in a church in ge neral, church or synagogue, I should say – it’s a person who helps you to your se at so things are a little more organized, a little more orderly. So, when you come  to the back of the church, there’ll be an usher that will help you find a seat  in the church. And in weddings, it’s traditional to ask the person coming, “Are you  a friend of the bride?” And the “bride” (bride) – that’s the girl, the woman being married – or the “groom” (groom) – and the groom is the man. It depends which side o f the church you sit on, if you’re a friend of the bride or a friend of the gro om. If you’re the friend of both, you have to sit outside the church. No, no, no I’m kidding – joke. They’ll put you on whichever side you want to sit on. That’s how it ’s done traditionally. “Usher,” by the way, the word “usher” is also a name of a fa mous singer in the United States. 

Any case, going on with the story here, the person in our story said he was a friend of the groom and he sat on the left side bec ause that’s where the friends of the groom and the family of the groom sit. He saw h is friend Ulrich standing at the front of the church with the best man. And so, as it is probably in other countries, the tradition in the United States is th at the man – the person getting married, the groom, usually with another man – a fr iend of his – and that friend and sometimes there’s more than one, but that frien d is called the “best man” – the “best (best) man” – and he is responsible for -   legally, he’s responsible for witnessing the marriage. “To be a witness” (witness ) here means that you sign your name on the government form saying that yes, t his person was married and I was there. “To witness” in general means to obser ve or to see something – usually, something official. Although, it can also be, if you see a crime or an accident, you are a witness to the accident, a witn ess to the crime. Well, there’s no crime here. They’re just getting married and the  best man is a witness. Although, it might be an accident, the wedding, so,  maybe you can use a witness for that as well.  

The flower girl and the ring bearer are the first t wo people to walk up the aisle. The “aisle” (aisle) is the center of the church. No w, again, traditionally, the flower girl is a young girl – usually 5, 6, 7, maybe 10, o r 12 years old at most and they are responsible for bringing up flowers for the bri de. The “ring bearer” – and that’s two words – (ring) “ring bearer” which is sp elled (bearer) – a “ring,” of course, is what you put on your hand and the bride and the groom both have rings. “Wedding rings,” we would call them. Well, t he ring bearer brings those rings up to the best man or to the people standing in front, and that again is usually, traditionally a small, young boy – again f our, five, six, maybe 10 or 12  

years old. Often it’s a cousin or a younger sister or younger brother, depending on the family.  

Well, the “flower girl” and “ring bearer” walked do wn the aisle, and notice, the verb there “to walk down the aisle” – that’s for so me reason, we say that with that particular word “aisle.” So, you walk down, or you could “run down the aisle,” if you were late I guess. And after the ring bearer an d the flower girl, there are the bridesmaids. And the “bridesmaid” is all one word ( bridesmaid). A “maid” – traditionally in English – a “maid” is (maid) – is an unmarried woman, but in a wedding, we use the term “bridesmaid” for any girl or woman that is a friend of the bride and is going to be with her, standing wit h her when she gets married.  

I mentioned before that we have the best man and fo r the woman, we have a “maid of honor.” The “maid of honor” (honor) is her  best friend, the person that she has as her witness. And she is one of the bride smaids. Well, the bride appears, in our story, wearing a beautiful wedding dress, traditionally white dress in American weddings, and she’s walking down the ai sle with her father who was “giving her away.” Again, the tradition is if a wom an is getting married, her father, although sometimes her father and her mother, but t raditionally her father, walks with her and gives her away. Now, it’s kind of a st range expression. When we talk about the verb “to give away” - two words – “g ive away” usually means you’re giving something like you’re giving away you r pen to someone. You’re giving them your pen. But here, we use this very sp ecial case in a wedding. “To give away the bride” means you’re the person that –  the father usually that sort of gives his daughter to the husband, to the man. It’s  very old, very old tradition and some couples do that and some couples don’t do that  anymore.   

The bride and groom then, are ready to get married,  finally. And they exchange “vows.” “To exchange (exchange) vows” – two words –  (vows) – “exchange vows” means that they say that they will love the o ther person and they promise to be – we’d say, promise to be faithful. “To be fa ithful” means that you will only be in love with that person and will only be with t hat person, romantically anyway, and this is called a “vow.” And a “vow” is like a p romise that you are making. And the traditional promise, you’ll see in movies and s ome very traditional weddings, the priest or the minister or the rabbi will say, “ John, do you take this woman, Maria, to be your lawfully wedded wife?” “Lawfully”  means legally and “wedded wife” is kind of – just wife would be good enough b ut the expression is a “wedded wife.” And the man says, “I do.” And of course, the  woman is asked the same question. I forgot her name – Maria – “Maria, do yo u take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?” And she says, “I do.” And  then they kiss and it’s all happy, at least for the first couple of days. 

At the reception, there is a lot of champagne. “Cha mpagne,” of course, is that special alcoholic beverage – technically comes from  an area in France. But now, people use that word for things that don’t come fro m France – special kind of wine.  

The best man makes a toast. A “toast” (toast), you may know, is when you raise your glass. When you lift your glass up and say som ething funny or nice, in this case, embarrassing about the groom or the bride and  groom. But even though this toast embarrassed Ulrich, the groom, “it was a ll in good fun.” “It was all in good fun,” meaning he didn’t mean it in a bad way, it was just for a joke.  

Well, at the end of the story, the man talks to his  friend, Ulrich, and he says that Ulrich was trying to set him up with the bridesmaid . “To set someone up” is when you have a friend, for example, and you know anothe r friend – woman – let’s say and you think that those two would be a good couple . So, you say to your friend who’s a man, “I want to introduce you to my friend”  – my female friend, my woman friend – and the idea is that he is setting t hem up. He is helping them get together, to be romantically involved. Well, the ma n in the story says that all married people, want to have all of their friends m arried too. And the story ends with the expression “We’ll see about that.” “We’ll”  (we’ll) – as in we will – “We’ll” or “We will see about that” – that expression means  that the person doesn’t agree or doesn’t want to do whatever is being talke d about and plans on not doing it, or in this case, he plans on not getting married. “We’ll see about that” means I don’t think so. And that is a common expres sion when you want to tell someone that you don’t – you aren’t going to do wha t they want you to do, in this case.  

Now let’s listen to the story again, quickly at a n ative rate of speech. 

[start of story] 

I got an invitation in the mail last month that rea lly surprised me. My friend Ulrich was getting married! We went to college together an d he always said that he’d never get married. I guess he found his dream girl in the end.  

The church wedding was going to be at 3 p.m. and th e reception would start at 7 p.m. at the reception hall.  

I arrived at the church shortly before 3 p.m. and o ne of the ushers asked me if I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I told him that I was a friend of the groom and he sat me on the left side of the church. I saw  Ulrich standing near the front of the church with the best man, and a few minutes later, the pianist started  

playing the wedding march. The flower girl and ring  bearer walked down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaid. Then, the bride appeared wearing a beautiful wedding dress, walking with her father who was givi ng her away. The bride and groom exchanged vows and they were married. It was a simple and traditional ceremony. 

At the reception, there was a lot of champagne. The  best man made a toast that really embarrassed Ulrich, but it was all in good f un. I got a chance to talk to Ulrich and he seemed really happy. In fact, he was trying to set me up with the bridesmaid. I guess it's true. All married people w ant to get all of their friends married. We'll see about that!
