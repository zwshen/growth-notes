This episode is called “Eating Junk Food.”  It’s a dialog ue between Frank and Katie about eating food that isn’t necessarily very good  for your health but tastes good.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Frank:  Hand me that bag of potato chips.

Katie:  Here.  You mean you’re still hungry after two  burgers and French fries?

Frank:  Yeah, I am.  I’m a growing boy.  Where’s the p opcorn?

Katie:  I can’t believe we’re eating all of this junk f ood.  I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.

Frank:  Forget about it.  Who can watch a football gam e without stuffing their faces?  It’s an American tradition.

Katie:  Where did you get those candy bars?

Frank:  Some kids were selling them door-to-door and I thought it was my duty to buy some.

Katie:  It was your duty to buy 10 candy bars?!

Frank:  What can I say?  I’m a softy.

 Katie:  I’m getting another soda.  Do you want one?

Frank:  No, thanks.  But while you’re up, can you hand m e the phone?

Katie:  Sure, why?

Frank:  I’m ordering a pizza.

We begin with Frank saying to Katie, “Hand me that ba g of potato chips.”  To “hand” someone something means to give something to some one, to pass something to someone.  “Hand me” is a command form; it’ s a little informal.  If you were being a little more polite, you would say, “p lease give me,” or “could you please hand me.”  If you’re sitting at a dinner tab le, you may say, “Hand me the salt” to your husband or child.  The word “hand” h as many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that term.

Frank says, “Hand me that bag of potato chips.”  Potato chips is an example of “junk food,” food that is not healthy.  “Junk” is another  word for trash, something you would throw away.  Junk food describes food that is b ad for you, often cheap food.  “Potato chips” are made from very thin slices of a  potato that are fried in oil; you put them in hot oil and you get potato chips.  You put salt on them.  In British English, potato chips are called “crisps,” and “chip s” means something different in British English.  But in American English,  “potato chips” is the term we use for this particular kind of junk food.

Katie says, “Here.”  That’s what you might say to someone when you are giving something to someone who is right next to you or in fron t of you.  “Here,” meaning here it is.  Then she says, “You mean you’re stil l hungry after (eating) two burgers and French fries?”  A “burger” is a hamburg er.  It’s a sandwich made by cooking ground beef (from a cow) and putting it in b etween two pieces of bread, usually adding mustard, ketchup, perhaps lettuce a nd tomatoes, onions, other things.  McDonald’s is the largest restaurant that  makes hamburgers – that sells hamburgers.  They are famous for their hamburgers.   “French fries” are a snack that is made by frying long pieces of potato in oil  and then adding salt. Once again, you can usually buy French fries at a place that  sells hamburgers.

So, Katie is wondering how Frank can still be hungry af ter eating so much food. Frank says, “Yeah, I am” – yes, I am still hungry.  Then h e jokes, “I’m a growing

 boy.”  When we say someone is a “growing boy,” or a “grow ing girl,” we mean that they need a lot of energy – they need a lot of fo od.  So, he’s giving this as an excuse.  Then he says, “Where’s the popcorn?”  “Popcorn” is a  snack, something you would eat at, for example the movie theater, where  you take small pieces of corn – dry corn – and you put them over heat until they o pen – until they burst open or explode, and you end up with these little whi te pieces of corn that you can then put butter and salt on.

Katie then says, “I can’t believe we’re eating all of th is junk food.  I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.”  To “watch what you eat” is a n expression that means to try to eat better foods, usually so you can lose weight (if  you have too much weight) or become healthier.  I need to watch what I eat – that’s for sure!

Frank says, “Forget about it (meaning don’t worry about  it).  Who can watch a football game without stuffing their faces?”  So, Fran k and Katie are watching an American football game, which usually takes place on Sund ay afternoon.  And it is a common tradition to watch the game on television at  home and eat junk food, and have snacks while you are watching it.  To “stuff your face” means to eat a lot of something very quickly.  It’s an informal expression: to “stuff (stuff) your face.”  Frank says, “It’s an American tradition.”  It’s so mething that all Americans do on a regular basis – stuff their faces during a foot ball game!

Katie then asks Frank, “Where did you get those candy bars?”   A “candy bar” is a small, usually “rectangular” (long and narrow) food tha t has nuts, chocolate, perhaps something else on it or in it.  There are man y famous kinds of candy bars; they’re very popular with children.  You can buy the m in most stores.  They are made with a lot of sugar, typically.

Frank says, “Some kids were selling them door-to-door and  I thought it was my duty to buy some.”  So, where did he buy the candy bars?   Well, normally you would buy them in a store, but there are many youth g roups and schools that try to “raise money,” meaning they try to get money for the ir school or their organization by selling things.  And they go to your hous e, they knock on your door, and they try to sell you these things.  This is very common; it happens to me in my house maybe two or three times a week.  To go “ door-to-door” means to go from house to house, or from business to business, kno cking on each door, asking to speak to the person so you can sell them somethin g.

Frank says he thought it was his duty to buy some.  Your “duty” is something that you are supposed to do, you must do, you need to do.  We  talk about voting in a democracy being your civic duty, “civic” meaning, in this case , what you owe the rest of society – what you owe your country.  So, a duty is something you are

 supposed to do.  Of course, Frank is joking here.  He doesn ’t have a duty to buy candy, but he says he does, probably because he was trying to  help this school or organization.

Katie says, “It was your duty to buy 10 candy bars?!”  Frank says, “What can I say?”  This expression is used when you don’t have a good answ er for what the person is asking you.  “Well, what can I say?” – I have no  excuse.  He says, “I’m a softy” (softy).  A “softy” is someone who has difficulty sayi ng no, someone who does whatever people ask him or her to do.

Katie says, “I’m getting another soda.  Do you want one? ”  “Soda,” sometimes called “soda pop” or, in Minnesota and in some of the Midwestern states, it’s just called “pop.”  It all refers a sweet drink that usually has small bubbles in it; we say it’s “carbonated.”  Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola – these are all examples of sodas, or as we say back in Minnesota, pop.

Frank says, “No, thanks (he does not want another soda).  But while you’re up,” meaning since you are already standing up and going int o the kitchen – “while you’re up, can you hand me the phone?”  Katie says, “Sure , why?”  Frank says, “I’m ordering a pizza.”  “Pizza” is a very typically Italian  food, made with a large, in the United States usually round, piece of bread that  you put tomato sauce, cheese, perhaps different kinds of meat on top of, and t hen you bake it in an oven.  Pizza is a very popular type of snack food, especially w hen you are watching a game – a sporting event like a football game .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
