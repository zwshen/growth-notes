This dialogue is between Penelope and Outis about d escribing relative location – where things are. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Penelope: Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.

Outis: It’s called Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of the country.

Penelope: Where is it exactly?

Outis: I can’t give you the coordinates, if that’s what you’re after.

Penelope: Of course not. I’m just trying to pinpoin t where it is. Is it near Wichita, Kansas?

Outis: It’s nowhere near Wichita. It’s in the heart  of a remote part of the country.

Penelope: Where is it relative to, this town?

Outis: I can’t give you any reference points or tel l you the distance. I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders  Nebraska.

Penelope: Why are you being so cryptic?

Outis: I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.

Penelope: I thought I’d come for an extended stay t o help you get settled.

Outis: You’ve just answered your own question.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Penelope saying to Outis, “Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.” Outis, apparently, is moving to a new city, a new town. Normally we consider a “town” smaller than a city, but we will sometimes use the two words interchangeably – that is, one for the ot her. Outis says the town is called “Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of  the country.”

The expression “smack (smack) dab” means exactly or  precisely in a certain place, in a certain spot. “Smack dab” is almost alw ays used for a location, to say something is exactly in this place. In fact, normal ly you will hear it together with the expression “in the middle of” – “It’s smack dab  in the middle of the city,” or “It’s smack dab in the middle of a bunch of apartme nt buildings.”

Penelope says, “Where is it exactly?” She wants to know where this town Outis is moving to is. Outis says, “I can’t give you the coo rdinates, if that’s what you’re after.” “Coordinates” (coordinates) refers to the l ongitude and latitude of a certain place. Of course, almost no one knows the coordinat es exactly of where they are. Los Angeles’s coordinates are approximately 34 .0500 degrees north and 118.2500 degrees west, approximately. Outis thinks that Penelope is asking for the coordinates, but of course, she isn’t.

He says, “I can’t give you the coordinates, if that ’s what you’re after.” The use of the word “after” here is a little different than the normal meaning of that word. It doesn’t mean something that comes in a place later than another thing. Instead, it means “looking for” or “trying to get.” If someo ne asks you, “What are you after?” the person is asking what you want, what yo u are trying to get – “What are you looking for?” That’s very different than the more common use of the word “after” such as in the expression “comes after” – “ two comes after one,” “three comes after two,” and so forth.

Penelope says she’s not looking for the coordinates , of course. She says, “I’m just trying to pinpoint where it is.” “To pinpoint”  (pinpoint) means to identify the exact location of something. It could also mean to get the exact meaning of something or to get a lot of detail, a lot of infor mation about a topic. Here we’re using it in the more common sense of location – whe re exactly is it? Penelope’s “trying to pinpoint where it is.”

“Is it near Wichita, Kansas?” Kansas is in the midd le part of the United States – the central part of the United States. Outis, howev er, says no. “It’s nowhere near Wichita.” The expression “nowhere near” means very far from, not close at all. He says, “It’s in the heart of a remote part of the  country.” If something is “in the heart (heart) of” something, it’s in the middle of or center of something. It’s completely surrounded by something.

If you say, “My house is in the heart of the Mojave  Desert,” you mean that it is in the center or middle part of the desert. If you say , “I want to go to New York City and stay in the heart of Manhattan,” you’re saying you want to go and stay right in the middle part of New York City or right where most of the action is in New York City, which is in the borough of Manhattan – t he island which is part of New York City.

The word “heart” normally refers to an organ in you r body – the part of your body that pumps or moves blood through the rest of the b ody. But here it means more the center, or most important part. Outis says that  the town he’s moving to is “in the heart of a remote part of the country.” Somethi ng that is “remote” (remote) is far away from cities and towns and where most peopl e live.

Penelope says, “Where is it relative to, this town? ” The expression “relative to” means in comparison to or in relation to. Outis say s, “I can’t give you any reference points or tell you the distance.” It does n’t sound like Outis knows where he’s going. He says he can’t give Penelope “any ref erence points.” “Reference points” would be something that allows you to deter mine facts about another thing. We might also use the expression “a basis for comparison.”

So, for example, I often describe where a state is in the United States by trying to give you some reference points in terms of directio n – “It’s in the northeast part of the U.S.,” “It’s in the center part of the U.S.,” o r I might say, “It’s 180 miles west of Chicago.” Chicago is a reference point – something you know about already that can help you determine the meaning, or in this case  the location, of another place. But Outis says he can’t give Penelope any re ference points or tell her the distance, the number of miles or kilometers, this t own is from another town.

He continues, “I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders Nebraska.” The “outskirts” (outskirts) refe rs to the area surrounding a town or a city. You have the central part of a city , and then you have the areas which we sometimes call “suburbs” that are on the “ outskirts.” Sometimes we use the word “outskirts” to refer to places that are ev en farther away than the suburbs, that are not part of any town or city form ally, but we’re not quite sure what Outis means about it, just that it’s not in the center part of the town.

 He says it’s “on the outskirts of a “medium-sized t own” – that is, not a large town, not a small town, but something in between. He says  it “borders (borders) Nebraska,” which is a state, again, in the center of the country of the United States. “To border” means to be next to something.

Penelope says, “Why are you being so cryptic?” “Cry ptic” (cryptic) means difficult to understand, unclear. We use the word “cryptic” o ften when someone is using a special code – a person is not giving the informati on in a way we can understand. They might even be using special numbers or even a special language. Penelope wants to know why Outis isn’t just telling  her exactly where this place is.

Outis says, “I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.” “To spill the beans” (beans) means to tell someone a se cret, often by accident. If you “spill the beans” to your friend about something, y ou tell your friend a secret, but you do it accidentally. You didn’t mean to do it. O utis wants Penelope not to accidentally tell him why she’s asking where he’s m oving, but to tell him directly. “Why are you asking me?” That’s what Outis wants to  know.

Penelope says, “I thought I’d come for an extended stay to help you get settled.” Penelope explains to Outis that she wants to know w here he is moving so she can go and help him. She wants to come “for an exte nded (extended) stay (stay).” An “extended stay” is a long visit – when you are visiting someone for many days, perhaps even weeks.

Penelope wants to help Outis “get settled.” The phr asal verb “to get settled” (settled) means to get comfortable in a new place, especially after you’ve just moved there. Sometimes it takes a few weeks for you  to get settled when you move into a new apartment or a new house. You have to find out where everything is and make sure all of your things are in the places you want them to be inside of your apartment. Penelope wants to go a nd help Outis get settled by staying with him for a long period of time.

Outis ends the dialogue by saying, “You’ve just ans wered your own question.” Remember Penelope’s question (or at least the last one she asked in the dialogue) of Outis is “Why are you being so cryptic ?” Why are you being so secretive? Why aren’t you telling me where you’re g oing to live? Well, the answer of course is that Outis doesn’t want Penelope to co me and stay with him and help him get settled. I wonder why?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Penelope: Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.

Outis: It’s called Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of the country.

Penelope: Where is it exactly?

Outis: I can’t give you the coordinates, if that’s what you’re after.

Penelope: Of course not. I’m just trying to pinpoin t where it is. Is it near Wichita, Kansas?

Penelope: Where is it relative to, this town?

Outis: I can’t give you any reference points or tel l you the distance. I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders  Nebraska.

Outis: You’ve just answered your own question.
