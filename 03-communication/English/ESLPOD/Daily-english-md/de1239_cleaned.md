This episode is a dialogue between Sara and Gabriel  about having more than one person use your online account. Let’s get start ed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Sara: Hello, customer service. How may I help you t oday? 

Gabriel: Hello. I noticed some suspicious activity on my account and I want to find out if there’s been unauthorized access. 

Sara: Let’s take a look. Your account history shows  purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago. 

Gabriel: That’s the problem. I haven’t made any pur chases. 

Sara: Do you have a shared account, by any chance? 

Gabriel: Yes, I have a household account that’s sha red by my entire family. My wife has full access, but my children only have res tricted access.  

Sara: I’m afraid that’s not showing in your account  preferences. Both of your children have full access. 

Gabriel: Even so, they know not to abuse their priv ileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first. 

Sara: Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your c hildren have accessed the account regularly. In fact, they’re both logged on right now.  

 Gabriel: They are? What are they doing?  

Sara: They’re in the process of buying several more  items and are checking out. 

Gabriel: Stop them! This is an emergency. Shut down  my account. 

Sara: I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps you can stop them on your end. 

Gabriel: I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I  get my hands on those two!

We’re talking in this episode about sharing, or mor e than one person using, an online or internet account. An “account” is, in thi s case, permission to use a certain website, usually one that requires you regi ster – and often, pay – to use. Our dialogue begins with Sara saying, “Hello, custo mer service. How may I help you?” Sara, then, works for a company, an online co mpany. She is part of their “customer service” – the people who are supposed to  help you when you have a problem.  

Gabriel says, “Hello. I noticed some suspicious act ivity on my account.” “Suspicious (suspicious) activity” is something, so me activity or action, that you don’t recognize or that you think might be a proble m. If you see someone standing by your car and looking as though he might  try to steal your car, that would be an example of “suspicious activity.” The p erson is standing there and you’re not quite sure why. You think there might be  some problem in the near future with this person.  

In the case of Gabriel, he noticed some suspicious activity on his online account. He noticed things that he perhaps didn’t recognize or should not have been there. He wants to find out if there has been any “ unauthorized access.” “Access” (access) is the ability to get into somewhere. It c ould be a physical place, or in this case it could be an account on a website. “Una uthorized” (unauthorized) is “not authorized,” meaning you don’t have permission  to do that.  

Sara says, “Let’s take a look. Your account history  shows purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago.” Your “account history ” would be a list on your website account of all the things that have happene d on your account – all the things, in this case, that you have purchased or bo ught. Gabriel says, “That’s the problem. I haven’t made any purchases.” Sara is say ing that there have been  

purchases on Gabriel’s account every day for the pa st two weeks, but Gabriel is saying he hasn’t bought anything. He didn’t buy any thing from this website.  

Sara then asks him, “Do you have a shared account, by any chance?” “To share” (share) is to use something with another person or to give something to another person to use as well. A “shared account” would be an account, in this case on a website, that two or more people could use. Sara ad ds the expression at the end of her question, “by any chance.” “By any chance” i s a polite way of asking if something is possible. We might also say “maybe” or  “perhaps.” “Do you by any chance have a pen I can borrow?” You are politely a sking someone if they have a pen that you could use.  

Gabriel says, in answer to Sara’s question, “Yes, I  have a household account that’s shared by my entire family.” “Household” (ho usehold) refers to the group of people who live in your house or in your home. Usua lly all of those people are members of your family – a father, a mother, childr en, perhaps a grandmother, or even an aunt and an uncle. Those are all part of a “household” – people who live in one house or one apartment. Gabriel says he has a “household account” and every member of his family has access to this accou nt.  

He says, “My wife has full access but my children o nly have restricted access.” Gabriel talks about two kinds of access. The first kind is “full” (full). If you have “full access” to something, you have complete acces s. You have just as much access as the person who owns the account. Gabriel says his wife has “full access,” the same access that Gabriel has, but his children only have “restricted (restricted) access.” “Restricted” means that you a ren’t able to do everything someone with full access can do. “Restricted” means  partial, or just a part of the larger or whole amount.  

Sara says, “I’m afraid that’s not showing in your a ccount preferences.” Sara, the customer service woman, is telling Gabriel that his  account is not set up – his account is not, we might say, “configured” – for re stricted access for his children. Your “account preferences” are the things that you can turn on and off or change about your account. Sara then tells Gabriel, “Both of your children have full access.”  

Gabriel says, “Even so” – meaning “Well, okay, even  if that were true” – “they,” meaning his two children, “know not to abuse their privileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first.” Gabriel  is saying that even though his children have full access to his account, they woul d not “abuse” (abuse) their privileges. “To abuse” something is to use somethin g in a harmful way – either  

doing too much of something or doing it in a way th at could hurt you or someone else.  

“To abuse someone’s privileges” (privileges) is to use the authorization or right to do something in a wrong way. “Privileges” refer to things that you are able to do, in this case. So, “to abuse your privileges” would be to use the things that you can use in a way you should not use them. In this c ase, Gabriel is saying his children would not buy something from this online a ccount without asking him or his wife.  

Sara says, “Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your children have access to the account regularly,” meaning “frequently.” “In f act, they’re both logged on right now.” “To be logged (logged) on” means to be regist ered and using a website at a certain point, at a certain time. If you are “log ged on to your account,” you have signed in. You have logged in with your username an d password and are using a certain website.  

Sara is saying that Gabriel’s two children are usin g this website right now. Gabriel says, “They are? What are they doing?” Sara  says, “They’re in the process of” – meaning “they are right now” – “buyin g several more items,” several more things, “and are checking out.” “To ch eck (check) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to complete your purchase of s omething.  

Normally on a website, when you buy something, you say you want to buy it by adding it to a “shopping cart.” This is sort of a p age where what you want to buy is being kept. Then you “check out.” Then you say, “Okay, I want to buy it,” and you put in your credit card information and you say , “Yes, I want to buy it.” “To check out,” then, means to complete your purchase o f something, to buy something by giving a website your payment informat ion – your credit card number or perhaps your PayPal account information.  

Gabriel tells Sara to stop his children from checki ng out. “This is an emergency,” he says. “Shut down my account.” The phrasal verb “ to shut (shut) down” means to close something so that it no longer functions o r no longer works. If the owner of a company “shuts down” his business, he closes h is business. The business stops functioning. Gabriel wants Sara to shut down his online account. But Sara says, “I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps, yo u can stop them on your end.” “On your end” means where you are, at your location .  

Gabriel says, “I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I get my hands on those two!” Gabriel is obviously angry. He’s upset. He says, “I ’ll stop them,” meaning his two children, “all right.” The expression “all (all) ri ght (right)” means certainly, for sure,  

without any doubt. Here it’s meant to indicate just  how certain – and in a way, angry – Gabriel is. “I’ll stop them all right,” mea ning I will definitely stop them. I am certainly going to stop them. Notice that “all r ight” is two words. It’s often spelled nowadays as one word, (alright), but the mo re traditional spelling is (all) and then (right) as two words.  

Gabriel then ends our dialogue by saying, “Just wai t till I get my hands on those two.” “Wait till” (‘til) means “wait until.” “‘Till ” is just a short way of saying “until.” “Wait until I get my hands on” someone means I am v ery angry and I’m going to hurt someone for doing something wrong. I’m going t o punish someone for doing something wrong. It might be something a parent wou ld say about his or her child if the child has done something wrong.  

That’s the case here. Gabriel is very angry at his two children. We don’t know if he’s actually going to hurt them physically, but ce rtainly he is going to punish them. He is going to do something to discipline the m for buying things on this website without his permission.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
