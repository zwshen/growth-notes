<h1>Problem I: Innumerous bowling games</h1>
</center>
<p>As you all know Homer Jay Simpson is an enthusiastic bowling player.
The last times when he played with his friends Carl and Lenny, Homer
always scored the same number of points, but the games differed in at
least one frame. Carl wonders how often Homer can reach the same number
of points without playing any two identical games. </p>
<p>For those of you who never enjoyed the great game of bowling we will
explain the rules of bowling in detail: </p>
<p>A bowling game
consists of ten frames. Each frame starts with ten pins standing that
you attempt to knock down by rolling a bowling ball towards the pins.
A frame ends after two attempts or if there is no pin left standing.
For each frame you get the number of pins you knocked down as points.
However there are some bonus points if you manage to knock down all
the pins. </p>
<p>If you knock down all ten pins in the first attempt it is called a
"strike" and you get as a bonus the number of pins knocked down in
the next two attempts (which belong to the next frame(s)). If you
manage to knock down all the remaining pins in the second attempt it
is called a "spare" and you get the number of pins knocked down in
the next attempt as a bonus (again, this attempt belongs to the next
frame).
In the last frame there are special rules for the bonus
points: If you have got a spare/strike you have one/two additional
bonus attempt(s) which count only as bonus points. If you have got
two bonus attempts and have knocked down all pins with your first
attempt, you start again with 10 pins for your second bonus attempt.
As you may notice, it is possible to score a maximum of 30 points
in each frame, thereby scoring 300 points in total.</p>
<p>Your task is to help Carl to calculate the number of different
bowling games which result in a specific score. </p>
<h4>Input Specification</h4>
<p>
The input contains several test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer <strong>s</strong>
(<i>0 &le; s &le; 300</i>), the score for which you have to calculate
the number of different bowling games.
</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing <i>-1</i>.
</p>
<h4>Output Specification</h4>
<p>
For each test case, print the number of different bowling games resulting in the given score in one line.
You may assume that this number
fits into a signed 64-bit integer (in C/C++ you can use the data type
"long long", in JAVA the data type "long").
