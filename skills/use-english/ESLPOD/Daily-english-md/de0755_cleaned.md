This episode is a dialogue between Darlene and Chri s about someone who doesn’t like new technology.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Darlene:  Thanks for agreeing to take a look at my computer.  It’s been acting up lately. 

Chris:  Sure, I don’t mind.  Is this it? 

Darlene:  Yeah. 

Chris:  How long have you had this computer?  It lo oks like it belongs in the ice age. 

Darlene:  I admit it’s a little dated.  I must be o ne of the last holdouts in switching to a newer model. 

Chris:  What are you waiting for?  It seems to me t hat all of your computer problems would be solved if you spring for a new on e. 

Darlene:  I have a lot of old programs on this comp uter that aren’t compatible with the newer models.  I’m kind of attached to the m. 

Chris:  They probably aren’t compatible because the re are now better, more efficient programs that have overtaken the ones you  currently use.  Your programs are probably obsolete.  Which programs are  they?  Maybe I can show you how to use the newer versions.  

 Darlene:  Well, there’s one particular program…  

Chris:  Yes? 

Darlene:  It’s a game I like to play. 

Chris:  You’re refusing to buy a newer, better comp uter just because you’d have to give up a game? 

Darlene:  It’s a really fun game and I’m keeping th is computer until they make a version for the newer computers. 

Chris:  Okay, but you know what they say: live by t he sword, die by the sword. 

Darlene:  So you won’t help me fix my computer? 

Chris:  I’ll try, but I’m telling you now.  It’s a lost cause.

Darlene says to Chris, “Thanks for agreeing to take  a look at my computer.  It’s been acting up lately.”  The verb “to act up” is a two-word phrasal expression meaning to behave or operate badly in a way that yo u don’t expect or that isn’t doing what you want it to do.  If your computer is running slowly, or certain programs aren’t working the way they should, we mig ht say that your computer is acting up.  There are several other meanings of thi s expression; look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Chris says, “Sure, I don’t mind.  Is this it?”  Is this your computer?  Darlene says, “Yeah.”  Chris says, “How long have you had this co mputer?  It looks like it belongs in the ice age.”  The “ice age” is a very c old period of history, approximately 20,000 years ago, when much of the Ea rth was covered with ice and snow.  However in this conversation, it’s used to describe something that is very, very, very old.  We might also say the “stone  age,” meaning a long, long time ago.   

Chris wants to know how long Darlene has had this c omputer.  Darlene says, “I admit it’s a little dated.”  Something that is “dat ed” here means out of date, not modern, very old, something that is not what you wo uld find nowadays.  Darlene says, “I must be one of the last holdouts in switch ing to a newer model.”  A “holdout” (holdout – one word) is someone who is th e last person to change,  

someone who doesn’t want to agree to something or d oesn’t want to accept something.  A “holdout” would be someone or some or ganization that resists changing; everyone else is changing but they will n ot.  Darlene says that she must be one of the last holdouts in switching to a newer model.  “To switch” means to replace or exchange one thing for another,  to buy something new in this case.  A “model” (model) here means one partic ular design of a machine. With computers, there’s usually a new model of your  computer – your kind of computer – every year.  If you own an Apple compute r the Apple computer you buy in 2012 will not be the same, often, as the one  you bought in 2011 or 2010; there are newer models – newer types. 

Chris says, “What are you waiting for?  It seems to  me that all of your computer problems would be solved (you wouldn’t have them an ymore) if you spring for a new one (a new computer).”  “To spring for (somethi ng)” means to pay for something; it’s an informal way of saying to buy or  to pay for – “to spring for (something).”  “Spring” has a couple of other meani ngs in English as well; once again, look at the Learning Guide for some addition al explanations. 

Chris wants Darlene to buy a new computer.  Darlene  says, “I have a lot of old programs on this computer that aren’t compatible wi th the newer models.”  “To be compatible” (compatible) means that you can use it with something else, often referring to hardware and software, when we say thi s software is compatible with the new software, even though it’s a new operating system.  For example you go from Windows XP to Windows 7, you want to know if y our software – your programs – will be compatible.  Will they work?  Mo re generally, the adjective “compatible” refers to two things or two people who  will get along well together. Some people end a relationship because they decide they are not compatible with the other person, or because the other person forgot her birthday and now she’s upset and if he had only called her she would n’t be angry.  See?   

Well, Darlene is worried about the compatibility of  her computer software.  She says that she is very attached to her computer prog rams.  “To be attached to” here means to like something very much; you don’t w ant to get rid of it.  “I’m very attached to my old television.”  I like it very muc h.  You can attach something to something else.  You can attach, for example, a fil e to an email, but here the verb means to like something: “I’m very attached to (som ething).”  So Darlene doesn’t want to buy a new computer because she’s very attac hed to some programs that won’t be compatible with the new computer and its n ew operating system, which is the software – the general software, we could ca ll it, that the computer uses. 

Chris says, “They probably aren’t compatible becaus e they’re now better, more efficient programs that have overtaken the ones you  currently use.”  “To  

overtake” (overtake) means to go past something, to  become better or more successful than someone or something else.  “The te am began winning more games and they overtook” – notice the past tense – “overtook the opposing team (the other team that they were playing).”  Well, Ch ris is saying that the computer programs that Darlene has are probably better now, they have new versions that are better so she doesn’t really need to worry abou t compatibility, she just needs to get the new programs – the new software programs .  Chris says, “Your programs are probably obsolete.”  “To be obsolete” (obsolete) means they are no longer useful because there is something else that can do the same thing better now.  Some people say that cassette tapes are obsol ete because we have things that are better now, like CDs and DVDs and MP3s.  A lthough, one thing I liked about the old cassette tapes is that when you stopp ed listening to a song the tape would stay right there and you could go back t o start right where you were before.  With a CD, of course, you can’t actually d o that, at least you can fast forward or rewind, but you understand what I’m sayi ng.  So maybe cassette tapes aren’t obsolete after all.  I still have a wh ole box of them in my closet. 

Well, Chris thinks that Darlene’s software programs  are obsolete.  He says, “Which programs are they?  Maybe I can show you how  to use the newer versions (the newer kinds of that software).”  Darl ene says, “Well, there’s one particular program…”  Chris says, “Yes?”  Darlene s ays, “It’s a game I like to play.”  Chris says, “You’re refusing to buy a newer , better computer just because you have to give up a game?”  “To give up (somethin g)” or “to give (something) up” means to decide you no longer can use it or you  can no longer do that.  “I’m going to give up smoking.”  I’m going to stop smoki ng.  I don’t actually smoke, so that’s just an example.  “I’m going to give up talk ing about cats.”  I talk about cats all the time, you know I love cats, but maybe I’ll give up talking about them – probably not, though. 

Chris is saying that Darlene doesn’t want to buy a new computer because she doesn’t want to give up a game that she plays on he r old computer.  Darlene says, “It’s a really fun game and I’m keeping this computer until they make a version for the newer computers.”  Chris says, “Oka y, but you know what they say: live by the sword, die by the sword.”  A “swor d” is a long, sharp instrument; it’s a weapon that you hurt or kill someone with.  It’s like a big knife, you could call it.  There’s an expression “live by the sword,  die by the sword,” which originally, I believe, appeared in the Bible.  It m eans that the way you choose to live affects what happens to you in the future.  Us ually you’re telling someone that if you are going to act that way eventually yo u are going to be hurt by your actions.  If you always criticize other people, and  then some day someone criticizes you and you’re hurt by that, we could sa y, “Well, live by the sword, die  

by the sword.”  You did that sort of thing and now you are suffering from that same action. 

Darlene says, “So you won’t help me fix my computer ?”  Chris says, “I’ll try, but I’m telling you now.  It’s a lost cause.”  A “lost cause” (cause) is something that cannot succeed no matter how hard you try; you can try doing it but you will not be successful.  You will lose, if you will, and hen ce, or therefore, it’s a lost cause. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
