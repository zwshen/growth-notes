This episode is called “Describing Facial Expressions.”  We’re going to listen to a conversation between Marjorie and Pedro about the way that people use their face to express their feelings.  There are different terms that we use for the kinds of expressions that you will see on someone’s face.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Marjorie:  I wish I could have been there when you told the managers that you were leaving the company and starting your own business!    Pedro:  Everyone was taken aback.  Dan gave me a dirty look, of course.  He’s always looked down his nose at me.  As for Sanjaya, if looks could kill...  Marjorie:  Sanjaya?  I thought if anyone would understand why you wanted to strike out on your own, he would.  I honestly don’t know him that well, but I thought he was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.     Pedro:  Maybe I misread him, but he certainly wasn’t grinning ear to ear.  He just had a frown on his face the entire time.    Marjorie:  What about Wendy?  How did she react?
