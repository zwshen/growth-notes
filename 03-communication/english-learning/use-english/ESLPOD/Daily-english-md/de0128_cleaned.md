The script for today’s podcast and production is, a s always, by Dr. Lucy Tse, and we thank her for help. 

Today’s podcast is going to be about hiring a contr actor – someone who comes and works on your house or your office to change it  or to fix it. Let’s get started! > My company decided that it was time to remodel our offices and I was put in charge of getting bids from contractors. The troubl e was, I had heard horror stories from friends who did remodeling and I was w orried about finding a company that would get the job done on time and und er budget.  
> No doubt there are many honest contractors, but som e of the people I talked to had experiences with shady companies. Some of them weren't on the level about being able to meet deadlines and some tried to get away with murder when they billed for a job. It was important that I found a c ompany that was on the up and up. 
> I got bids from six companies and checked all of th eir references. In the end, I picked a company that had done work for one of the biggest companies in the city. They seemed to be the best and our company hi red them. I have my fingers crossed that everything will go smoothly.

Today we are talking about hiring a contractor. And  the word “contractor” (contractors) is, comes from rather, the word contr act, which is an agreement, of course, between two people. We would say an agreeme nt between two “parties” (parties). It’s the same word as “parties” when you  celebrate, but when we say there’s a “contract between two parties,” we mean e ither between two individuals or between two companies or groups of individuals. Well, a “contractor” – with an  

“or” at the end – is the name of the person who doe s the contract. And usually, when we talk about a “contractor,” we’re usually ta lking about someone who works independently. In fact, we use the term “inde pendent contractor.” This is a person who works for him or herself, not for anothe r company and you can hire this person just to do a specific job. And when the y’re done with that job, you pay them, and that’s it. They go on to another job.  

Well, in this story for this podcast, the person in  the story says that “It was time to remodel our offices.” “To remodel” (remodel) means to fix, to change, to improve, to make better. And usually, we use this verb when we are talking about a house or a building where we are going to, for example, r emodel our bathroom. That means we’re going to fix it, put in some new cabine ts, put in a new bathtub – that would be remodeling. Well, in the story, this perso n is remodeling their office and he was put in charge of getting bids from contracto rs. “To be put in charge of” – that expression means that they were responsible fo r. So, if I say, “I’m putting you in charge of finding a new gardener for our gar den,” – a “gardener” – someone who works in a garden – that means that you  are responsible for that. It’s your job to do it. You must be the leader, the  boss, for that particular task, that particular job.  

A “bid” (bid) is when a company or an independent c ontractor says, “We can do that job for a thousand dollars.” In other words, a  “bid” is an offer to do a particular job. And you get many different bids and  then you find the bid that you like best. Well, he was supposed to get bids from c ontractors. The trouble was he had heard “horror stories” from friends who did rem odeling. “Horror stories” (horror) – two words – “horror stories” – a “horror  story” is normally a scary story like, for example, “Count Dracula the Vampire” is a  horror story. In this case, however, when someone says, “I heard a horror story ” they mean I heard a horrible experience. A person who had a very bad – it’s a very bad story of something that went wrong. And usually this is, for  example, you’re talking about a vacation you took. And it was a really bad hotel.  And you tell your friends that it’s a horrible hotel. They might say, “Oh, I heard  horror stories about that hotel. I heard bad stories about it.”  

Well, the person in our story here, which is not a horror story, was worried about finding a company that would “get the job done on t ime.” “The job” (job) here just means the specific task. A “task” (task) is the sam e as a small job. Well, “to get the job done on time,” means to get it done when it  is scheduled to be done. So, if you promise to finish it by Friday, you must com plete it by Friday to be “on time.” The other thing that he wanted is that the c ompany would come in “under budget.” “Under budget” – “budget” (budget) – is ho w much money you are going to spend. So, when someone says they’re “under budg et” – we often use the  

expression “to come in under budget” – means that i t will cost less than they had planned. So, if the contract bid is for a thousand dollars, but it only cost $750, that contract came in under budget.  

The story continues, “No doubt there are many hones t contractors.” When someone uses the expression “no doubt,” they mean “ of course.” “Of course, there are many honest contractors,” or “I believe t hat there are many honest contractors.” But some of the people he talked too had experiences with “shady companies.” “Shady” (shady) would be a company that  isn’t honest. A dishonest company would be “shady.” They try to steal your mo ney or they don’t finish what they say they are going to finish – that would be a  “shady company.” In Britain, they would probably use a term like “dodgy” (dodgy) . “Dodgy” – as the Brits – someone from Britain might say it – is the same as “shady” in American English. Well, some of these contractors, according to our s tory, weren’t “on the level” about being able to meet deadlines. “To be on the l evel” (level) – that means again, to be honest. So, if someone says, “I’m on t he level with you,” they mean I am telling you the truth. I am being honest with yo u. 

The companies, some of the companies, “try to get a way with murder” when they bill for a job. The expression “To get away with mu rder” (murder) – literally, “murder” means when someone kills someone else. But  the expression “To get away with murder” means that you did a terrible thi ng, a very bad thing but you get away, meaning you are able to do it without bei ng punished or perhaps, without anyone knowing. So, “To get away with murde r” is to do a very bad thing but you do not have to – you are not punished for i t. 

Well, “To bill for a job” (bill) means that you ask  for money. So, “I’m going to bill you for something” means I’m going to send you a bi ll and tell you how much money you have to pay me. The company that the pers on in our story is looking for, he wants it to be “on the up and up.” The expr ession “on the up and up” – and “up” (up) – just like “up and down” – to be “on  the up and up” means once again, the same as to be on the level. It means it’ s an honest company, a company that tells the truth.  

Well, the person here gets bids from six companies and checks all of their references. “To check” is the same as to investigat e. And a “references” (references) – “references” are when the names of p eople or companies that you have done work for. So, if I am a contractor, and I  worked for Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith, I would say, “Well, here are my references.”  And I would give them the name and the telephone number of these people and y ou can call them and say, “Well did this person do a good job?” You have refe rences for contract bids. You also have references for a job, of course, people t hat you have worked for.  

 Well, in the end, he decided to pick a company that  had done work for one of the biggest companies in the city, or had worked for. A nd the person in our story says that he has his “fingers crossed” that everyth ing would go smoothly. “To have your fingers crossed” (crossed) means that you  are hoping, you are praying, you’re not sure and we use that expression  when you don’t have any more control over what will happen. So, “I have my fingers crossed that it won’t rain today.” I can’t control that, but I am hoping I am lucky. And to cross your fingers, you take the first two fingers, of course,  and you put the middle finger – the second finger, not counting your thumb – the se cond finger behind the first finger. And that is “crossing your fingers.” Well, for things to go “smoothly” means that they will go without problems – that the contr actor won’t give the company any problem. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue or the story, rath er, this time at a native rate of speech. > My company decided that it was time to remodel our offices and I was put in charge of getting bids from contractors. The troubl e was, I had heard horror stories from friends who did remodeling and I was w orried about finding a company that would get the job done on time and und er budget.  
> No doubt there are many honest contractors, but som e of the people I talked to had experiences with shady companies.
