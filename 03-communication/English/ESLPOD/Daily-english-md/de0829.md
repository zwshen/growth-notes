George:  Good. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ll need to ga ther some wood to burn to give the meat that smoky flavor. 

Sophia:  Why don’t I do that while you get things g oing? 

George:  No, I need to do things my way. I also nee d to make my world-famous barbecue sauce. The meat won’t taste very good if I  don’t baste it with my special sauce each time I flip it.   

Sophia:  Okay, how about if I get the corn on the c ob ready for grilling?

Sophia:  Is there anything I can do to hurry things  along?

Our dialog begins with George saying, “Step aside!”  That expression, “Step aside (aside),” is used when you are telling someone to m ove out of your way, to move so that you can walk through a certain area or you can be in a certain area. George is saying, “Move over! The king of the cooko ut is here.” “The king of” is used when a man thinks he’s the best person in some  area. He’s the expert. “I’m the king of poker players.” “I’m the king of podcas ters.” “I’m the king of the world” – well, that was in Titanic . Remember the movie, Titanic ? Yeah. Anyway, that’s what we mean. “I’m the king of.” I’m the most power ful person or the most knowledgeable or expert person in this area. A woma n would say, “I’m the queen of something.”  

George is the king of “cookouts.” A “cookout” (cook out) is an event where food is cooked, usually outside – outside of a house or a b uilding. And it’s cooked over an open fire. We would say it’s “grilled,” so that you have these little bars of metal and the fire underneath and you put the food on top  of the bars of metal – the “grill” – that’s a “cookout.” George says, “I’m rea dy to work my magic on this barbecue.” The expression “to work your magic” mean s I’m going to do something very well. I’m going to do something bett er than anyone else can do.  

A “barbecue” is a large device that is used to cook  outside. It has a grill on it. You can either use gas, which is very popular nowadays,  but the traditional way is to use small pieces of charcoal that you light on fire  and then the charcoal gets hot and that cooks the food, that provides the heat. So , a barbecue can refer to that device, that thing that you use to cook with. Somet imes, it’s just used to describe a cookout, a party. “We’re going to have a barbecue ,” meaning we’re going to have a meal where we cook outside on a barbecue. Th is is often abbreviated – “barbecue” (barbecue) – with three letters capitali zed – “BBQ.”  

Sophia says, “Here are the burgers and hotdogs. The  kids are pretty hungry.” “Burgers” refers to hamburgers, “hotdogs” are hotdo gs, and those are popular things to cook at a barbecue, in addition to ribs a nd chicken. “The kids are pretty hungry,” Sophia says, meaning the kids are very hun gry. George says, “Hold on,” meaning wait, “I need to put on the charcoal. Now, I’m ready to fire up this barbecue. Where’s the lighter fluid?” Remember I sa id there is sort of a traditional way of doing barbecues where you use li ttle pieces of charcoal, basically. What you do is you put the charcoal (cha rcoal) inside the barbecue, then you put on lighter fluid. “Lighter fluid” is a  liquid that you pour over the  

charcoal that causes it to burn when you put fire o n there. “To fire up” would mean to light something, to start a fire burning. A nd so, what you’re doing is you are lighting up the pieces of charcoal so they’ll g et hot and once they get hot, then you can food on top of the grill and cook it.  

George is firing up the barbecue. He’s asking for t he lighter fluid and Sophia says, “It’s right here.” George says, “Good. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ll need to gather some wood” – I’ll need to get some wood – “to burn to give the meat that smoky flavor.” “Smoky” (smoky) means a lot of smoke – the  gray colored air that comes from burning something with a fire, basically. And that’s popular in barbecues, to want to have, for some things, a smoky flavor. Ther e’re different ways of getting that. Burning wood is one of them. I think you can actually buy charcoal that’s somehow flavored and when you use it, it produces t hat smoky effect or result.  

Sophia says, “Why don’t I do that while you get thi ngs going?” Sophia’s saying, “I’ll go get the wood. You start the barbecue.” Geo rge says, “No. I need to do things my way,” meaning I need to do things the way  I want to do them. “I also need to make my world famous barbecue sauce.” “Worl d famous” means everyone in the world knows about it. A “barbecue s auce” (sauce) – is a thick liquid you put on top of the meat that you’re cooki ng that gives it a very certain barbecue taste. I’m not sure how to describe. It’s usually made with something a little sweet.  

George says, “The meat won’t taste very good if I d on’t baste it with my special sauce each time I flip it.” “To baste” (baste) mean s to use a small tool. It looks often like a brush – to put the sauce, this heavy o r thick liquid, over the food so that it doesn’t become too dry. George needs to “ba ste” the meat with his special sauce each time he “flips it.” “To flip” (flip) her e means to turn something over. So, if you’re cooking a hamburger, you cook one sid e, and then you flip it over, you turn it over and cook the other side. Sometimes , jokingly, we talk about people who work in hamburger restaurants like McDon ald’s as “flipping burgers.” The term is used to describe a job that doesn’t pay  very well and is probably not the most interesting.  

Sophia says, “Okay, how about if I get the corn on the cob ready for grilling?” “Corn on the cob” is corn, the vegetable, that come s still attached to the hard inedible – what you don’t eat – part of the plant. If you know what corn looks like, when you take it off the plant. Well, you take the outside of the corn off – what we call the “husk” (husk) – and you’re left with the “ corn on the cob (cob).” The “cob” is the middle part of the plant, the hard part that  you don’t eat. “Grilling,” you already know, means to cook something on top of thi s metal device.  

So “grill” can be a noun but here it’s used as a ve rb. It means basically the same as barbecuing, in this instance. George says, “I’ll  do that. I have my own special way of preparing corn.” Sophia says, “Is there anyt hing I can do to hurry things along?” Remember the children are hungry and George  is taking a long time. So Sophia says she wants to “hurry things along” – tha t means to speed things up, to make things happen more quickly. George says, “P erfection takes time.” “Perfection” is when you can’t do anything any bett er than it is. It’s without any mistakes.  

George says, “Would you tell Michelangelo to hurry up?” Michelangelo, you probably know, is the – or was – the influential It alian Renaissance artist who painted the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican in Rome. He created the statue of David in Florence, Italy, and so forth. Michelangel o here is used to mean an artist, a great artist, and George thinks of himsel f as a great artist. We also, if we’re trying to describe someone who’s brilliant, s omeone who’s intellectually a genius, we would say, “He’s an Einstein.” Well, Geo rge is saying he’s a Michelangelo – he’s a great artist as a cook.  

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
