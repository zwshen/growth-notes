This episode is a dialogue between Jeannie and Will iam about describing how well students do in school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeannie: Everything okay?

William: No, I just got off the phone with my daugh ter’s school and they’re not putting her in the gifted and talented program.

Jeannie: That’s disappointing, but wasn’t she strug gling in school last year?

William: Her teachers were thinking of putting her in remedial classes. Can you believe that? My daughter is getting poor grades be cause she’s bored in school. She tunes out. She’d be coasting in her classes if the teachers would just challenge her.

Jeannie: Are you sure that’s the problem? My son wa s considered low-achieving in the lower grades, but since starting high school , he’s doing a lot better.

William: I’m telling you, my daughter could be high -achieving if they’d only put her in the gifted and talented program. It’s all ab out teacher expectations.

Jeannie: Well, it’s not all about expectations . . .

William: Are you trying to tell me that my daughter  is slow and I should just accept it?

Jeannie: I’m saying that kids develop at their own pace. Some are late bloomers.

 William: Nobody in my family has ever been late in anything, and they’re not going to start now.

Jeannie: Putting pressure on her might make matters  worse.

William: Who’s putting pressure on her? Maybe I can  help her by getting her tutors in every subject and enrolling her in summer  programs.

Jeannie: Maybe she just needs more time . . .

William: And let her waste her potential? What kind  of father would I be then?

[end of dialogue]

Jeannie asks William, “Everything okay?” meaning “I s everything okay?” Sometimes, informally in English, we may not put the word or the verb “is” in the sentence, but we understand what the person is sayi ng.

William says, “No, I just got off the phone,” meani ng I was just talking on the phone, “with my daughter’s school and they’re not p utting her in the gifted and talented program.” “To be gifted” means to be very intelligent or to have some special skill, some special ability. Similarly, “to  be talented” means to have a special ability to do something. It might be an abi lity to sing very well, or to play music, or sports, or to perhaps even be good at mat h or English.

In many American schools, there are special program s for students who are considered especially intelligent or who have speci al gifts or talents, and these are called “gifted and talented programs.” I myself  was never in a school that had a gifted and talented program. It’s something that started in the 1980s in some schools in the U.S., although there were probably p rograms before that, that went under different names, had different names for  them. Nowadays it has become very popular in many public schools to have these gifted and talented programs.

Jeannie says, “That’s disappointing,” meaning it’s disappointing that William’s daughter will not be put into one of these gifted a nd talented programs. Maybe William’s daughter isn’t as intelligent as he think s she is. Jeannie says, “Wasn’t she struggling in school last year?” “To be struggl ing” (struggling) means to be having difficulties, to be having problems with som ething. If you’re struggling in school, you’re having a difficult time. You’re not doing very well.

William says, “Her teachers were thinking of puttin g her in remedial classes.” “Remedial (remedial) classes” are classes that are meant to help students who are not doing very well in school, students who are  doing worse than the other students in their grade level or in their class. If  all the other students are able to do, say, algebra and you can’t even do arithmetic, you might be put in a remedial class – a class designed especially for students wh o are behind the other students of that particular age.

William is surprised the teachers were going to put  his daughter into a remedial class. He says, “My daughter is getting poor grades  because she’s bored in school.” “Poor grades” would be not very good grade s, bad grades. He says that his daughter is just bored – that’s why she doesn’t  do well in school. Yeah, I’m sure that’s the reason. “She tunes out,” William sa ys. “To tune (tune) out” means to stop paying attention, to ignore what is happeni ng around you and instead think of something else.

William claims, “She’d be coasting in her classes i f the teachers would just challenge her.” “To be coasting” (coasting) means t o be doing something very well without even trying, without having to work ve ry hard. He thinks the teachers need “to challenge” (challenge) his daughter. “To c hallenge” a student in class here would refer to making the student work harder by giving the student something more difficult. William thinks that if hi s daughter’s teachers gave her things that were more difficult, she would pay atte ntion and do better in school.

Jeannie says, “Are you sure that’s the problem? My son was considered low- achieving in the lower grades, but since starting h igh school, he’s doing a lot better.” “To be low-achieving” means to not be perf orming very well in school, to be getting bad grades in school. “Lower grades” her e means elementary school, when a child is, say, ages six through 10 or so.

William says, “I’m telling you, my daughter could b e high-achieving if they’d only put her in the gifted and talented program.” “I’m t elling you” is an expression William uses here because he’s trying to get Jeanni e to understand and he doesn’t think Jeannie is really listening to him. H e is trying to convince Jeannie. He’s trying to convince Jeannie that his daughter c ould be “high-achieving” – that is, could be getting good grades – if the school wo uld only put her in the gifted and talented program.

He says, “It’s all about teacher expectations.” “It ’s all about” here means what’s important – the most important thing. William think s the most important thing is “teacher expectations” (expectations) Your “expecta tions” are what you believe someone can do or should do. William thinks that if  the teachers had higher

expectations of his daughter, she would do better, and there’s a theory in education that says that students perform depending  on how well their teachers expect the students to perform.

Jeannie says, “Well, it’s not all about expectation s,” meaning that isn’t the entire story or that doesn’t explain everything. William d oesn’t agree. He interrupts her and says, “Are you trying to tell me that my daught er is slow and I should just accept it?” “To be slow,” here means to not learn a s quickly as the other children or perhaps not to be quite as intelligent as the ot her children.

Jeannie says, “I’m saying that kids develop at thei r own pace.” “To develop” here means to grow intellectually. She’s saying that kid s develop “at their own pace” (pace). “Pace” refers to the speed – how quickly, i n this case, kids develop. William doesn’t like the idea that Jeannie perhaps thinks his daughter is developing more slowly intellectually than the othe r students. Jeannie tries to defend herself by saying, “I’m just saying that kid s develop at their own pace. Some are late bloomers.”

“To be a late bloomer” (bloomer) is to develop or m ature later than other people do, at a later age than other people do. Some peopl e, for example, take longer to finish their college education, or they may go back  to college when they are older than the typical student in order to study. We may describe that kind of person as a “late bloomer” – someone who doesn’t do well at s omething until a later age than is typical for that particular skill or achiev ement.

There’s a famous painter in the U.S., “Grandma Mose s,” who didn’t start painting until she was quite elderly. She is a good example of a “late bloomer.” The word “bloomer” comes from the verb “to bloom,” which des cribes the process of a flower opening up in, normally, the springtime. Wil liam says, “Nobody in my family has ever been late in anything, and they’re not going to start now,” meaning no one in my family is a late bloomer and m y daughter will not be a late bloomer, either.

Jeannie says, “Putting pressure on her might make m atters worse.” “To put pressure” (pressure) on someone is to say or do som ething to someone that indicates you expect him to do very well. You expec t him to perform well, or perform a certain task quickly. “To make matters wo rse” means to make something that is already a problem an even worse p roblem – to take what is already a small problem and make it an even larger problem.

William says, “Who’s putting pressure on her?” He’s  rejecting the idea that he is putting any pressure on his daughter. He says, “May be I can help her by getting

her tutors in every subject and enrolling her in su mmer programs.” A “tutor” (tutor) is a person who provides one-on-one or pers onal instruction outside of a classroom to a student who is having difficulty.

Many parents will pay someone or pay an organizatio n to give their sons and daughters extra help in academic subjects outside of school. This happens in many different countries including here in the U.S.  Some parents will send their students to “summer programs.” These are basically schools that take place in the summer time to help students do better or to he lp students learn more than they could learn in their own regular schools.

Jeannie says, “Maybe she just needs more time.” Wil liam says, “And let her waste her potential?” A person’s “potential” (poten tial) is the set of skills or abilities that a person has that could be developed  further. Your “potential” is what you could do in the future based on the skills , intellect, or talent that you have now. You could talk about a student having “gr eat potential” as a mathematician or as a musician. That means that the  student isn’t a great mathematician or a musician now, but could be in the future.

William doesn’t want to waste his daughter’s potent ial. He says, “What kind of father would I be then?” meaning if I did that, I w ould not be a very good father.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jeannie: Everything okay?

William: No, I just got off the phone with my daugh ter’s school and they’re not putting her in the gifted and talented program.

Jeannie: That’s disappointing, but wasn’t she strug gling in school last year?

William: Her teachers were thinking of putting her in remedial classes. Can you believe that? My daughter is getting poor grades be cause she’s bored in school. She tunes out. She’d be coasting in her classes if the teachers would just challenge her.

This episode is a dialogue between John and Lindsay  about someone who has had a problem with drugs or alcohol and wants to ge t better. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

John: I’m glad to see you’re back and looking so he althy.

Lindsay: Thanks. Rehab wasn’t easy, but getting tre atment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit rock bottom.

John: Recovery from substance abuse isn’t easy, but  I’m happy you got the help you needed.

Lindsay: I’m glad I checked into an inpatient progr am. I was able to detox, and I’m now getting the medication and counseling I nee d.

John: I thought you were done.

Lindsay: No, I’m now in their outpatient program, w ith a plan for staying sober so I won’t relapse.

John: And you’re staying away from temptation?

Lindsay: Absolutely. I’m only going clubbing two ni ghts a week, instead of every night.

John: Uh, is that wise?

Lindsay: It will be a good test of my self-control.

John: That doesn’t sound . . .

Lindsay: [sound of a car horn] Sorry, there’s my ri de. We’re checking out a new club tonight.

John: Yikes.

[end of dialogue]

John begins our dialogue by saying to Lindsay, “I’m  glad to see you’re back and looking so healthy.” Lindsay says, “Thanks. Rehab w asn’t easy, but getting treatment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit r ock bottom.” “Rehab” (rehab) is short for “rehabilitation” (rehabilitation). And “r ehab” or “rehabilitation” is a program that you go through when you have a problem , usually related to some sort of “addiction” (addiction).

An “addiction” is when you do something or use some thing so much that you lose control of other parts of your life. You may, for e xample, be addicted to alcohol, where you drink alcohol so much that you are unable  to have a job or have a family. Some people try to stop having these addict ions by going to a special program called “rehab.” Often, these are programs t hat are located in other places. You actually go and stay in a separate buil ding or house. Lindsay has gone to rehab and she got treatment for her addicti on.

“Treatment” is medical care that a doctor gives a p atient, but it could also be care given by a psychologist or other counselor to help someone, in this case, break or get rid of one’s addiction to a certain drug or a certain behavior. You can be addicted to certain behaviors just as you can be ad dicted to certain physical substances such as alcohol or drugs. Some people are addicted to “gambling” – to going out and spending money on cards and other games to try to win more money. Notice the use of the preposition “to” –  yo u are “addicted to” something.

Lindsay says the treatment for her addiction saved her life, meaning if she had not gotten the treatment, she might have died. She says, “I’d hit rock bottom.” “Rock bottom” is the lowest, worst point in your li fe or in the particular addiction that you have. “To hit rock bottom” is to be the wo rst you could possibly be. Some people say that people who have addictions nee d to hit rock bottom. They need to be at their lowest point before they can ge t better.

 John says, “Recovery from substance abuse isn’t eas y, but I’m happy you got the help you needed.” “Recovery” (recovery) is getting better from some illness or some disease or some medical problem. We also use t his word “recovery” when we’re talking about the economy getting better afte r it has been in a very bad state or poor condition. Here, we’re talking about a person getting better – in this case, recovering from “substance (substance) abuse (abuse).” “Substance abuse” is when you use drugs or alcohol in such a w ay that you become addicted to them.

John says, “Recovery from substance abuse isn’t eas y, but I’m happy you got the help you needed.” Lindsay says, “I’m glad I checked  into an inpatient program.” “Inpatient” (inpatient) refers to a situation where  you go and you stay at a hospital or a clinic for a long time, or at least overnight.  In the hospital, we talk about people who are getting “inpatient treatment” and “o utpatient treatment.” “Outpatient treatment” is when you go to a hospital  or a clinic but then you go home at the end of the day. You don’t stay there.

Lindsay went into an “inpatient recovery program” w here she went and actually slept there, stayed there for a certain period of t ime. Maybe it was a week or perhaps a month. Lindsay says she was able to “deto x” (detox). “To detox” means to go through the process where the chemicals  in your body from the alcohol or the drugs are able to leave your body an d therefore no longer affect you physically.

Some people use the same term when they are trying to get rid of what they consider bad chemicals from the food they eat. But here, we’re talking about someone who has been abusing drugs or alcohol. “Det oxing” means to wait until those chemicals are out of your body, or at least t hat’s the general idea. She says, “I’m now getting the medication” – that is, o ther drugs – “and counseling I need.” “Counseling” is professional guidance from s omeone who is trained to help you with this particular psychological problem  or this particular addiction.

John says, “I thought you were done,” meaning I tho ught you were finished. I thought you didn’t have to go to any more programs.  Lindsay says, “No, I’m in their outpatient program.” We just defined “outpati ent” (outpatient) a few seconds ago. It’s when you go and get medical treatment but  you don’t stay at the clinic or hospital. You go back to your own house at the end of the day.

Lindsay says that she’s in an outpatient program, “ with a plan for staying sober so I won’t relapse.” “To be sober” (sober) is to no t be drunk. “To be sober” is the opposite of being drunk or being under the influenc e of drugs or alcohol. Lindsay

doesn’t want to “relapse” (relapse). “To relapse” m eans to go back to your former poor condition.

If you have cancer, for example, and you get rid of  the cancer for a certain amount of time and you’re feeling better, but then the cancer comes back, we would call that a “relapse” of the cancer. The canc er returned. People who go through drug rehabilitation programs sometimes get better – they feel better – but then they “relapse.” They go back to being addicted  to the chemical, the drug or alcohol, to which they were addicted before.

John says, “And you’re staying away from temptation ?” “Temptation” (temptation) is something that makes you want to do something or  want to have something that perhaps you shouldn’t do or have. If you are t rying to lose weight and you have a big piece of chocolate cake sitting in front  of you, that chocolate cake is a “temptation.” It is something that makes you want t o eat the cake in this case and do something you shouldn’t do – at least, if you wa nt to lose weight.

Temptations for a drug addict would be situations i n which they could use drugs again. You want to stay away from those situations.  This is common sense or used to be common sense. Everyone used to know that  if you don’t want to do something, you should avoid situations where those things are present or there are temptations to do those things.

Lindsay says she’s staying away from temptations – situations that might cause her to want to drink or take drugs again. She says,  “I’m only going clubbing two nights a week, instead of every night.” “To go club bing” (clubbing) means to go to bars or nightclubs where people drink and dance. So metimes we just use the verb “to club” instead of “to go clubbing.” Here in  Los Angeles, there are lots of young men and women who go clubbing up in Hollywood , which is a neighborhood in Los Angeles where there are lots of  bars and clubs – dance clubs.

When I was a younger man, I went to some clubs here  in Los Angeles, but I was never very good at dancing so clubbing wasn’t a goo d place for me. Besides, none of the good-looking women wanted to dance with  me anyway. Lindsay says she’s going clubbing two nights a week. John doesn’ t think that’s a good idea. He says, “Uh, is that wise?” “Wise” (wise) means intel ligent. Is that a good idea?

Lindsay says, “It will be a good test of my self-co ntrol.” “Self-control” is your ability to control your thoughts, words, and action s, especially when you are in a difficult or tempting situation. If you are sitting  with your girlfriend or your wife and another beautiful woman walks by you, you must have  “self-control.” You don’t

want to be looking at another woman, especially whe n you are with your own beautiful woman. That is an example of “self-contro l,” gentlemen.

Lindsay thinks that going to a club where there are  other people drinking will be a good test of her self-control. She’ll be able to se e whether she can really resist drinking again. John begins by saying, “That doesn’ t sound . . .” He’s trying to say, “That doesn’t sound like a good idea.” But the n we hear the sound of a car “horn” – that part of the car that makes a very lou d noise to warn other drivers of something. Lindsay says, “Sorry, there’s my ride,” meaning there is the person who I am going to go with tonight, someone who is g oing to drive me somewhere.

She says, “We’re checking out a new club tonight.” “To check out” means to investigate or to go to for the first time to see i f it’s any good. John ends our dialogue by saying, “Yikes” (yikes). “Yikes” is a w ord we use to express our surprise, usually at something bad. Sometimes we say “yikes” to be funny, but it is normally used to express your surprise or shock at something. John is surprised that Lindsay is going to this new club. H e doesn’t think it’s a very good idea. It will be too much of a temptation for her w ith all that alcohol around her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

John: I’m glad to see you’re back and looking so he althy.

Lindsay: Thanks. Rehab wasn’t easy, but getting tre atment for my addiction saved my life. I’d hit rock bottom.

John: Recovery from substance abuse isn’t easy, but  I’m happy you got the help you needed.

Lindsay: I’m glad I checked into an inpatient progr am. I was able to detox, and I’m now getting the medication and counseling I nee d.

# Controlling Information to the Media

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,204 – Controlling Information to the Media.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,204. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful L.A., CA. (That’s Los Angeles, California .)

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our website. It  has our ESL Podcast Store on it that contains some ESL Podcast Special Course s in Business and Daily English that I think you will enjoy. In fact, I kno w it. You can also like us on Facebook. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

In this episode, we’re going to listen to a little story about controlling information – being careful what kind of information you give – t o television stations, newspapers, radio shows, and nowadays, news website s. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pablo: Okay everybody, have a seat. The purpose of this meeting is to get everybody on the same page.

I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prepared. This  fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in t he dark about our current situation.

We’ve also prepared these talking points. This is f or internal use only. I don’t want them leaked to the media. These talking points  have been prepared to help everyone stay on message. Anyone talking to the med ia off-script will have to answer to me.

These talking points preempt many of the possible q uestions you’ll be asked. We hope to take the wind out of their sails by address ing some of the media’s most likely questions up front. Any questions?

Suzanna: Um, I’ve read through these talking points  and I’m still not sure how to answer one key question.

Pablo: What’s that?

Suzanna: Have we solved the huge issue that’s the c ause of our current problems?

Pablo: It goes without saying that if the media eve r wants a straightforward answer, our response is always “no comment.”

[end of dialogue]

We are at a meeting in this episode. The meeting is  being run by, or managed by, Pablo. Pablo begins by saying, “Okay everybody,  have a seat,” meaning please sit down. “The purpose of this meeting,” Pab lo continues, “is to get everybody on the same page” (page).

The expression “to be on the same page” means to ha ve the same understanding or knowledge about something. Sometim es it can also mean to have the same opinion about something. So, if you s ay to someone, “I want to make sure we are on the same page,” you are saying to this person “I want to make sure we both understand the same thing,” or we  both agree about this issue or have the same knowledge about this issue.

He says, “I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prep ared.” “To pass out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to give something to many  different people, usually a piece of paper. “To pass out” means to distribute –  we might also say “to hand (hand) out.” A teacher “hands out” papers to her st udents, or a boss “passes out” agendas to the members of the committee. “To pass o ut,” “to hand out,” “to distribute” all mean to give something to many diff erent people. You could also pass out water to people at a party. Everyone gets a glass of water or a bottle of water.

Pablo is passing out a “fact (fact) sheet (sheet).”  A “fact sheet” is a piece of paper that contains important details or information abou t something. Often, fact sheets have simple sentences that just give the most impor tant or “key (key) information.” A fact sheet is usually just one piec e of paper that contains a summary of the most important information on a topi c. Pablo says, “This fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in the dark about our current situation.”

A “rundown” (rundown) – one word – is a summary of the most important points or pieces of information. We might also refer to it  as a “brief” or short “overview” (overview). If, for example, you miss a meeting, yo u might ask one of your “colleagues,” one of the people you work with, for a “rundown” on the meeting – a summary of the most important things that happened.  This is a “rundown” on

what has happened “to date,” meaning up to the pres ent point or up to this moment. We might also say “so far.”

It’s a “rundown on what has happened to date so tha t” – in order that – “no one is in the dark.” “To be in the dark” means to be unawa re or uninformed, without knowledge or information about something. We often use this with the verb “leave.” “I don’t want to leave you in the dark” or  “I don’t want you to be in the dark.” I want to give you the information.

This expression “in the dark” would probably be use d more often in a business situation, although it could also be used in your p ersonal life. “I’m in the dark about what my neighbor is doing with his dog.” I do n’t know why it barks or makes noise all the time. I’m in the dark. Maybe he ’s teaching the dog to sing. I don’t know. Pablo continues, “We’ve also prepared t hese talking points.” “Talking points” are key ideas that you want someone to expr ess in an interview, a speech, or a presentation. They’re the points or id eas you are going to talk about.

Nowadays, in business and in politics, “talking poi nts” are the key ideas that everyone from an organization or everyone who is su pporting a particular political candidate talks about so that the message is the sa me coming from the organization. If you have an organization, a busine ss that has had problems, you want everyone to talk about the problems in the sam e way so that the media – newspapers, magazines, television stations, and so forth – give the same message to their listeners or readers.

You want everyone to be on the same page by using t he same talking points, the same basic pieces of information, so that everyone is given the same message. If you don’t do that, that could cause problems. So me people may say one thing. Other people may say something that contradicts tha t or that is different from that. So that’s why having talking points is such a n important part of modern business and modern politics. However, Pablo says t hat these talking points “are for internal use only.” “Internal (internal) use” m eans just within the company or within your organization.

The opposite of internal would be “external” (exter nal). A business or political organization might create a set of talking points t hat it gives to all of the members of the “staff” – the people who work there. But the  business or organization doesn’t want the media to get these talking points directly because then it will look like the organization is just trying to presen t certain information and avoid other information being released. Of course, that’s  exactly what the organization is doing, but you don’t want people to think that.

That’s why Pablo says, “I don’t want them,” meaning  these talking points, “leaked (leaked) to the media.” “To leak” something is to s hare secret information to someone who should not have it, especially to someo ne in the media – a newspaper, a magazine, a television channel, and so  forth. Pablo says, “These talking points have been prepared to help everyone stay on message.” “To stay” – or “be” – “on message” means to be focused on the  main ideas or main topic, to be consistent in what you are telling people so that you don’t have different messages.

Pablo then warns the people at the meeting, “Anyone  talking to the media off- script will have to answer to me.” “Off-script” mea ns not following the talking points, not giving the message the company wants to  give. If you say someone “will have to answer to” you, you mean that person will have to explain his behavior to you and possibly be punished for not do ing the right thing.

Pablo continues, “These talking points preempt many  of the possible questions you’ll be asked.” “To preempt” (preempt) means to d o something in order to prevent something else from happening or to ensure that something else doesn’t happen. “To preempt a disagreement” is to do someth ing to prevent a disagreement from happening. The talking points Pab lo has prepared will “preempt” possible questions. It will prevent the m edia from asking certain things. It will give the answers first, if you will.

He says, “We hope to take the wind out of their sai ls by addressing some of the media’s most likely questions up front.” “To take t he wind (wind) out of someone’s sails (sails)” is to take away someone’s advantage or perhaps to make someone feel less confident. In this case, Pab lo is trying to make sure the press doesn’t ask embarrassing or critical question s by answering their questions “up front.” To do something “up front” is to do it at the beginning, before something else happens.

If you’re going to rent an apartment in the United States, usually you have to give the first month’s rent “up front” before you actual ly move into the apartment. Not only the first month’s rent, but usually an additio nal amount of money in case you cause some damage to the apartment. But we’re not t alking about apartments here. We’re talking about answering questions befor e people ask them.

Pablo then asks if any of the members of his meetin g have any questions. Suzanna says that she’s read through the talking po ints, but she’s not sure how to answer one “key,” or important, question. Pablo says, “What’s that?” meaning “What question?” Suzanna says, “Have we solved the huge issue that’s the

cause of our current problems?” In other words, has  the company actually solved the problem about which the media is going to be as king questions?

Pablo says, “It goes without saying that if the med ia ever wants a straightforward answer, our response is always ‘no comment.’’’ “It goes without saying” is an expression we use when we are stating something tha t is obvious, something that everyone should already know. “It goes without  saying that if you come to California, you should bring a hat and sunscreen to  put on your skin because we have a lot of sun.” That’s something that we assume  everyone knows. “It goes without saying,” Pablo says, “that if the media eve r wants a straightforward answer, our response is always ‘no comment.’”

A “straightforward (straightforward) answer” is a d irect and honest answer, a clear answer. The media will ask questions and want  an honest answer, and if that happens, Pablo says, “Our response is always ‘ no comment.’” “No comment” is a phrase used when you don’t want to answer a re porter’s question. You don’t want to answer questions from the newspaper or the television station or the magazine that is asking you questions. It’s a phrase that politicians and businesspeople often use when they are asked questi ons that they don’t want to answer.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pablo: Okay everybody, have a seat. The purpose of this meeting is to get everybody on the same page.

I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prepared. This  fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in t he dark about our current situation.

We’ve also prepared these talking points. This is f or internal use only. I don’t want them leaked to the media. These talking points  have been prepared to help everyone stay on message. Anyone talking to the med ia off-script will have to answer to me.

These talking points preempt many of the possible q uestions you’ll be asked. We hope to take the wind out of their sails by address ing some of the media’s most likely questions up front. Any questions?

 Suzanna: Um, I’ve read through these talking points  and I’m still not sure how to answer one key question.

Pablo: What’s that?

Suzanna: Have we solved the huge issue that’s the c ause of our current problems?

Pablo: It goes without saying that if the media eve r wants a straightforward answer, our response is always “no comment.”

This episode is a dialogue about being successful r omantically with women – something I know nothing about. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jonah: I’d love to get a date with Jessica. She’s s o hot!

Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost.

Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s noth ing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and caref ree.

Becca: Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about  your conquests.

Jonah: Why not? It’s no secret that I’ve got game. Chicks dig me. Last week alone I . . .

Becca: Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play -by-play.

Jonah: See that woman over there? Watch me put the moves on her.

Becca: No, thanks. I’m leaving.

Jonah: Wait! Are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica?

Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, r ight?

Jonah: Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.

Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player ?

Jonah: I thought she might like a man with experien ce.

Becca: Forget it.

Jonah: In that case, what are you doing Saturday?

[door slams]

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jonah saying to Becca, “I’ d love to get a date with Jessica.” A “date” is a romantic appointment – goin g to a movie or having dinner with someone you are romantically interested in. Jo nah thinks that Jessica is “hot,” meaning she’s attractive in a sexual way.

Becca says, “You mean you want to add another notch  to your bedpost? “To add a notch” (notch) to something is to make a mark, us ually in a piece of wood. The idea usually is that you are making the notch to ma rk or to count the number of times you’ve done something. If you are making a no tch in your “bedpost,” which is part of your bed, you are symbolically, if not a ctually, trying to count the number of romantic partners you’ve had.

Becca says that Jonah isn’t really interested in Je ssica as a person, but rather as a sexual object. Jonah says, “I’ve been around the block.” The expression – to say you’ve “been around the block” (block) – means you’ve had a lot of experience doing something.

Jonah says, “There’s nothing wrong with sowing a fe w wild oats” (oats). This expression “to sow (sow) wild oats” is actually a v ery old one, going back at least 500 years. It refers nowadays, in general, to a you ng man wasting his life doing things that aren’t very productive like drinking, a nd more specifically, having sexual experiences with different women. Depending on the context, it could be used to describe a young man who is wasting his lif e drinking and partying and, more specifically, on sexual adventures.

Jonah says, “That’s all part of being young and car efree.” “To be carefree” (carefree) means not to have any worries or concern s – to be free of cares, without any concerns. If you believe that “sowing a  few wild oats” means that you

will be carefree, you may be among the 50 percent of Americans who will at some point have a sexually transmitted disease in y our lifetime. So, congratulations. A “sexually transmitted disease” i s a disease you get from having sex with someone else who has that disease. But Jonah believes he will be carefree.

Becca says, “Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me  about your conquests” (conquests). A “conquest” is a victory or success. In this case it refers to having sexual relations. Jonah says, “Why not? It’s no sec ret I’ve got game.” The expression “I’ve got game” is used to show that a p erson is very good at something. It is sometimes used especially among me n who think that they are very attractive to other women and are able to have  many romantic relationships with women, or to have those easily because women a re attracted to them.

In fact, that’s what Jonah says in the next sentenc e. He says, “Chicks dig me.” The word “chick” (chick) is an informal word for a female, especially a young female. It is considered somewhat of a sexist term.  You probably do not want to use it in your own conversation. It’s also somewhat  of an older term that isn’t as common now as it was maybe 30 years ago – similarly  with the expression “to dig” someone. “To dig” (dig) someone means that you  are attracted romantically to that person.

Jonah seems to think that women are attracted to hi m. That’s why he says, “Chicks dig me.” “Last week alone, I . . .” He begi ns to tell Becca something but Becca interrupts him. She says, “Really, I think I’ ll take a pass on the play-by- play.” “To take a pass (pass) on” something is to c hoose not to do something or not to receive something. Someone may offer you, I don’t know, a piece of pie, and you are trying to lose weight. So you say, “I t hink I’ll take a pass on the piece of pie, but thank you.” You are declining to have it. You are choosing not to have it.

Becca wants to “take a pass on the play-by-play.” “ Play-by-play” is a detailed description of what happens – or in this case, of w hat happened. “Play-by-play” is a phrase that comes from the world of sports, when you are watching or listening to a sporting event. The person who is announcing t he game, who is talking about the game, will usually tell you exactly what is happening. This is especially true if you are listening on the radio. In order to  understand what is happening in the game, the person who is announcing the game giv es you the “play-by-play” – exactly what is happening at every moment in the ga me.

Jonah says, “See that woman over there? Watch me pu t the moves on her.” “To put the moves (moves) on” a person means to flirt w ith that person, to try to get

that person interested in you romantically. Becca s ays, “No, thanks. I’m leaving.” Jonah says, “Wait! are you going to put in a good w ord for me with Jessica?”

“To put in a good word” for someone is to recommend  someone to someone else or to say something good about someone. This is oft en used when someone is, say, applying for a job, or wanting to get a promot ion, or simply wants another person to like him. You may ask your friend “to put  in a good word for you” with a woman that he knows so that that woman will be inte rested in you. It probably won’t work, but you can try.

Becca says, “You know that she’s a good friend of m ine, right?” Becca is reminding Jonah that Jessica is one of her friends.  Jonah says, “Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.” Becca says, “And you th ought I’d set her up with a player?” “To set someone up” here means to arrange for someone to have a romantic date with another person.

When I first moved to Southern California, I had a student in one of my classes that I was teaching who I later became friends with , and she had a woman that she knew who was single, who was looking to date – who was looking to find a romantic partner. And so she set me up with her fri end. She got the two of us together and we went out and had dinner and went da ncing, I think. It wasn’t really a good match. She didn’t like me that much. I didn’t like her that much. So, things kind of ended. But my friend was nice enough  to “set me up on a date,” we might say, with this other woman. I think that’s the only time I’ve ever been set up on a date. Those kinds of arrangements are often ve ry successful. My mother and father met by being set up on a date by their f riends.

Becca doesn’t want to set up her friend Jessica on a date with Jonah because Jonah is a “player” (player). A “player” in this co ntext is a man who dates a lot of women, mostly because he wants to have sexual relat ions with them, not because he’s interested in them for any long-term r omantic relationship such as getting married. Jonah says, “I thought she might l ike a man with experience.” Becca says, however, “Forget it,” meaning she’s not  going to help him.

Jonah then says, “In that case, what are you doing Saturday?” Now Jonah is asking Becca for a date, and we don’t hear Becca’s response. We just hear the sound of the door slamming. “To slam” (slam) here r efers to a door that is being closed very loudly. The idea, of course, is that Be cca is saying no to Jonah by leaving. When a woman slams the door on you, you kn ow she’s probably not very happy – at least that’s my experience, anyway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Jonah: I’d love to get a date with Jessica. She’s s o hot!

Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to your bedpost.

Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s noth ing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and caref ree.

# Outdoor Vacation Sports and Activities

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,206 – Outdoor Vacation Sports and Activities.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,206. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Emma and Ricardo  about doing things I never do – outdoor sports and activities – while on  vacation. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: Are you ready?

Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I  thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.

Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead .

Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.

Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zi p-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.

Ricardo: I thought the point of this vacation was t o rest and recharge.

Emma: We do need to recharge, but what we need is e xcitement, not rest. Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorro w.

Ricardo: Why? What are we doing tomorrow?

Emma: How about a watersport, maybe kayaking, winds urfing, or water skiing? Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do som e snorkeling.

Ricardo: I like the idea of spending some time on t he water, but whale watching is more my speed.

Emma: Don’t you want to feel the wind through your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?

Ricardo: I didn’t know you were such an adrenaline junkie.

Emma: Guilty as charged. I’m going to take skydivin g lessons next month. Want to join me?

Ricardo: I consider skydiving a spectator sport!

[end of dialogue]

There are two kinds of people in the world. There a re those who like going outdoors and doing things, and then there are those  who like being indoors and doing things that don’t require being in the sun or  getting bitten by mosquitoes. I am one of the latter – that is, I am one of those w ho doesn’t really like being outdoors. But many people do like being outdoors, a nd so we’ll talk today about outdoor sports and activities, especially the sorts  of things that people do on their vacation, or so I am told.

Our dialogue begins with Emma saying, “Are you read y?” Ricardo says, “Sure, but why are you dressed like that?” Ricardo can’t u nderstand the way in which Emma is dressed, the clothing she has on. Ricardo s ays, “I thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.” “Golf” ( golf) is a game in which players hit a small white ball with a long metal st ick called a “club” (club). My father loved golfing. He used to go golfing two or three times a week after he retired from his job, when he was older.

Emma says, “I told them,” meaning Kareem and Karen,  “we’re going rock climbing instead.” “Rock climbing” is a sport that involves going up a rock wall, or a side of a large rock, usually with ropes and othe r instruments for safety. Some people go rock climbing on the side of a mountain o r a large rock, say, in the middle of the desert, which you can do here in Sout hern California. Other people go rock climbing on a wall where it isn’t actually a rock you’re climbing on, but rather a wall that is made to look like a big rock.

I tried going rock climbing once. I was trying to i mpress a beautiful girl – the sister of a woman I was working with at the time. This was , oh, 25 years ago. I absolutely hated it and I wasn’t very good at it. T he girl was much better than I

was and, well, I never saw her again. Anyway, rock climbing is what Emma is planning on doing.

Ricardo says, “I was really looking forward to a ga me of golf.” “To look forward to” something is to anticipate something in the sen se that you want to do it. “I’m looking forward to having a glass of wine this afte rnoon.” I really want to have a glass of wine. Thinking about it makes me happy. Th at would be what Ricardo is doing here. He’s “looking forward,” or “was looking  forward,” to a game of golf.

Emma says, “You play golf all the time. How often d o we get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zip-lining.” “Horseback (horseback) riding” is when you get on top of a hor se and go with the horse, usually at a slow speed, but sometimes at a fast sp eed, depending on how good you are at riding a horse. I have never been horseb ack riding. I’m kind of scared of the idea of getting on top of a horse. Maybe I s hould try a donkey or some animal that moves a little more slowly.

Emma mentions horseback riding and “zip-lining.” “Z ip (zip) – lining (lining)” is an activity in which you are attached, you are connect ed, to a long cable (cable) – a metal rope, you can think of it as – that is high u p in the air, and you actually ride, if you will, on this cable. You go down the cable, often over a beautiful area out in nature. I, of course, have never been zip-lining. I t looks like fun. Maybe someday I’ll try it.

Emma says, “We can do both this afternoon if you’re  for it.” “To be up for” something is to be ready to do something, especiall y something that might be a little difficult or challenging. Ricardo says, “I t hought the point,” the reason, “of this vacation was to rest and recharge.” “To rechar ge” means to get your energy back, to make you feel like you can do something ag ain, to make you feel as though you are ready to go back to work, for exampl e. Many people go on vacation to “recharge,” to get their energy back by  relaxing and doing things that are fun.

Emma says, “We do need to recharge, but what we nee d is excitement, not rest.” Some people go on vacation to rest. Some people go on vacation to do things that are exciting. Emma wants to do something that is exciting. She says, “Maybe Kareem and Karen will want to join us tomorrow.” Ri cardo asks, “Why? What are we doing tomorrow?” Emma says, “How about a water s port?” A “water sport” is an activity that takes place in, of course, the wat er.

Emma mentions some water sports, including “kayakin g,” “windsurfing,” and “water skiing.” “Kayaking” (kayaking) is going out in a little boat called a “kayak”

that is designed for one person. “Windsurfing” (win dsurfing) is the sport of riding on a small surfboard that has a sail attached. A “s ail” (sail) is a flat piece of material or cloth that is able to use the wind to h elp you move forward. Windsurfing involves going fast on the water on a s urfboard, a special kind of surfboard called a “sailboard.”

Another water sport Emma mentions is “water skiing”  (skiing). Normally we think of “skiing” as something you do in the wintertime o r in a cold place where there is snow. You move fast down a hill or a mountain. That  would be “downhill skiing.” “Water skiing” is when you have skis and are being pulled by a boat and you move across the water, holding on to a rope that is  attached to a boat. I have never gone water skiing or windsurfing or kayaking.  I’m not really much interested in water sports.

Emma continues, “Too bad we can’t go scuba diving, but we can do some snorkeling.” “Scuba (scuba) diving (diving)” involv es going under water while using some special equipment that allows you to bre athe underwater. You have what’s called an “oxygen tank” (tank) on your back,  and that allows you to breathe for a long time while you are underwater.

“Snorkeling” (snorkeling) is swimming just below the surface of the water. Your face is in the water but you are breathing through a special “tube” (tube), that is above the water and allows you to keep your face un derwater while being able to breathe. Have I ever gone scuba diving or snorkelin g? Of course not. I’m back at the hotel reading and having a drink.

Ricardo continues, “I like the idea of spending som e time on the water, but whale watching is more my speed.” “Whales” (whales) are l arge mammals in the ocean. “Whale watching” is when you go out on a boat and l ook for whales in the ocean. You can do that here in Southern California, althou gh I have never gone on a boat whale watching, myself. Ricardo says whale wat ching is more his “speed” (speed). The expression “more his speed” means more  interesting to him – something that is a better match for his interests and his level of energy.

Emma says, “Don’t you want to feel the wind through  your hair and the excitement pumping through your veins?” Emma is des cribing the experience that Ricardo can have if he goes windsurfing. She s ays Ricardo can feel the excitement “pumping (pumping) through his veins (ve ins).” “To have something pumping through your veins” means to, in this case,  be filled with excitement, that makes your body feel the excitement.

Your “veins” are the parts of your body that move b lood back and forth – your veins and your arteries. We use the verb “to pump” to describe the action the heart goes through in moving blood around the body,  and therefore “pumping through your veins” describes the heart being so ex cited, pumping so much, that the blood is moving through your body more quickly.

Ricardo says, “I didn’t know you were such an adren aline junkie.” An “adrenaline (adrenaline) junkie (junkie)” is a person who enjoy s excitement, who gets energy from sometimes dangerous activities. Emma says yes,  she is. But instead of just saying “yes,” she says, “Guilty as charged.” The ex pression “Guilty (guilty) as charged (charged)” is used to say that you agree wi th what someone says about you, but it’s a funny way of saying it because normally “to be guilty” of something is to have done something wrong.

Emma doesn’t think she’s done anything wrong. She’s  just trying to be funny when she says “Guilty as charged.” She says, “I’m g oing to take skydiving lessons next month.” “Skydiving” (skydiving) is the  rather insane activity of jumping out of an airplane and then opening up what  is called a “parachute” (parachute). A “parachute” is a large piece of mate rial that allows you to move down towards the ground slowly, so you don’t kill y ourself. That’s “skydiving.”

Emma says, “Want to join me?” Ricardo answers, “I c onsider skydiving a spectator sport!” A “spectator” (spectator) is some one who watches a sporting event or activity. A “spectator sport,” then, would  be a sport you would only want to watch, you wouldn’t want to participate in. Rica rdo thinks that skydiving is a “spectator sport,” meaning he doesn’t want to do it  himself. He thinks it’s too dangerous. And frankly, I agree with Ricardo.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: Are you ready?

Ricardo: Sure, but why are you dressed like that? I  thought we were going to play golf with Kareem and Karen.

Emma: I told them we’re going rock climbing instead .

Ricardo: I was really looking forward to a game of golf.

 Emma: You play golf all the time. How often do you get the chance to do other outdoor activities, such as horseback riding and zi p-lining. We can do both this afternoon if you’re up for it.

# Gauging the Doneness of Meat

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,207 – Gauging the Doneness of Meat.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,207. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

I highly recommend you go to ESLPod.com and become a member of ESL Podcast so you can download the Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guide contains all of what we say in a transcript, as well as a complete glossary of definitions and sample sentences. We also have a n ESL Podcast Store on our website that sells additional courses in Business a nd Daily English.

This episode is a dialogue talking about meat and h ow it is cooked, giving you some important words to describe how meat is cooked  that will become very useful to you if you ever go to a restaurant and ne ed to order meat in English. Well, I’m hungry. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chris: How do you like your steak?

Ruth: Well done. I don’t like any pink showing and I don’t mind if it’s a little charred.

Chris: I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it’ll be dry and tough.

Ruth: Yes, but a longer cooking time kills foodborn e illnesses. I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercooked.

Chris: It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to ea t. It’s easy to gauge when meat is done. How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?

Ruth: No, I don’t want to take any chances. I’d rat her the steak is overcooked than undercooked. Are you going to eat that?

Chris: Yes, I like my steak juicy.

Ruth: But that’s raw!

 Chris: No, it’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into  it so you can see that it’s cooked.

Ruth: It’s oozing red! That is definitely not cooke d.

Chris: I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this piece an d live to tell about it.

Ruth: Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re risking your health.

Chris: I think I’ll survive.

[end of dialogue]

Chris begins our dialogue by saying to Ruth, “How d o you like your steak?” A “steak” (steak) here refers to a thick slice, or pi ece, of “beef” (beef). “Beef” is meat from a cow. There are many different kinds of steak that come from a cow. We’re not sure exactly what kind Chris is asking Ru th about. Ruth answers, however, that she wants her steak “well done.” A pi ece of beef that is cooked “well done” is cooked so that there is no longer an y red or pink in it – that is, there’s no longer any sign of the red meat that is typically what you see when you have a piece of beef.

Ruth says, “I don’t like any pink showing and I don ’t mind if it’s a little charred” (charred). “Charred” meat is meat that has become b lack from being cooked too long or from being too close to a source of heat.

Now, people who like their beef “charred” don’t thi nk there’s anything wrong with that. That’s the way they like it. But that’s not t he way Chris likes it.

Chris says, “I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it will be dry and tough” (tough). When we describe meat as being “tough,” we’re sayin g that it is difficult to chew. “Tough” is the opposite of “tender” (tender), which  is when the meat is soft and often full of juices, full of liquid. Chris says th at cooking the beef well done will make it dry and tough. However, not all meat that i s cooked well done is dry and tough. Apparently, however, that’s what Chris belie ves will happen if he cooks this steak the way Ruth wants it.

Ruth says, “Yes” – she oddly agrees with him – “but  a longer cooking time kills foodborne illnesses.” “Cooking time” is how long so mething is cooked, how long something is put in or over a source of heat. “Illn esses” describe diseases that your body can get that make you sick. “Foodborne” ( foodborne) refers to things that are present in food.

 “Foodborne illnesses” are illnesses you can get fro m eating food that is in a certain condition – perhaps the food was left out t oo long outside of a refrigerator. You might get sick from eating food like that. That  would be a “foodborne illness” – a disease or illness that is passed through or tr ansferred through food. Ruth says, “I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercoo ked.” Something that is “undercooked” is something that is not cooked long enough, something that is not cooked enough. The opposite of “undercooked” wo uld be “overcooked” – something that is cooked for too long.

Chris says, “It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe  to eat.” Chris is describing the steak when he uses the word “it” here. “It” – that is, the steak – “doesn’t have to be burnt (burnt) to be safe to eat.” “Burnt” comes from the verb “to burn” (burn). If you “burn” food, you cook it too long so that it of ten becomes black. Chris thinks cooking the food to the point of being well done me ans that it will be burnt. Perhaps Chris hasn’t cooked very many steaks. I’m n ot sure.

He believes, however, that a piece of food doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to eat. He says, “It’s easy to gauge when meat is done .” “To gauge” (gauge) is to measure something, to determine how much of somethi ng there is. The name of this episode is “Gauging the Doneness of Meat.” “Do neness” (doneness) refers to how long or how much a piece of meat has been co oked.

Just as we have the words “undercooked” and “overco oked,” we have the terms “underdone” and “overdone.” Meat that is “underdone ” hasn’t been cooked long enough. Meat that is “overdone” has been cooked too  long. Chris says it’s easy to gauge the doneness of meat. He says, “How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?”

“To brown” (brown) meat is to cook it for a short t ime, often at a high temperature, so that the outside of the meat gets c ooked and turns the color brown. Sometimes a cook will do this “to seal (seal ) in the juices (juices).” “To seal in the juices” means to cook something quickly  on the outside so that the liquid inside of the meat doesn’t escape. It stays in the meat so that when you eat the meat, it has more flavor. That’s why Chris is s uggesting to brown each side and then cook it to “medium (medium) doneness.” “Me dium doneness” is cooking meat so that there is a little bit of pink inside.

The terms we use in describing meat as they relate to how much the meat is cooked are “rare” (rare), which is when the meat is  still very red; “medium rare,” which means it’s a little more cooked but still fai rly red; “medium,” which is in between being completely cooked – no red and rare –  “medium well,” which is

when there’s a little bit of pink but not very much ; and finally, “well done,” when there is no pinkness – when the meat is completely cooked through.

Chris is suggesting cooking the steak to medium don eness. Ruth says, “No, I don’t want to take any chances” – that is, I don’t want to have any risks of getting sick. “I’d rather the steak is overcooked than unde rcooked.” She then looks at Chris’s steak and says, “Are you going to eat that? ” Chris says, “Yes. I like my steak juicy” – with lots of liquid that comes out of the steak.

Ruth says, “But that’s raw!” (raw). Meat that is “r aw” is not cooked at all. That’s not the same as “rare,” where the meat is cooked bu t there’s still a lot of redness in the middle. Chris corrects Ruth and says, “No, it’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into it so you can see that it’s cooked.” Ruth says , however, “It’s oozing red!” “To ooze” (ooze) is for liquid to slowly come out of so mething. In this case, the liquid is the blood from the meat that is coming out. Ruth  says, “That is definitely not cooked.”

Chris says, “I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this pi ece and live to tell about it.” The expression “to live to tell about” something means to do something dangerous and then be able to survive it – not to be killed b y that experience. Chris is making a joke here. He doesn’t really think that he  going to die by eating this piece of meat. So he’s sort of making fun of Ruth w ho thinks that it is unsafe, that it is dangerous for him to eat this meat that is co oked rare instead of well done. He is going to eat it and then “live to tell about it.”

Ruth says, “Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re ri sking your health,” meaning you could get sick. Chris doesn’t think so. He says , “I think I’ll survive” (survive). “To survive” is to go through a dangerous situation  and still live, and still be okay. It’s the opposite here of “to die.” Chris doesn’t t hink he’s going to die from eating meat that is not well done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chris: How do you like your steak?

Ruth: Well done. I don’t like any pink showing and I don’t mind if it’s a little charred.

Chris: I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it’ll be dry and tough.

Ruth: Yes, but a longer cooking time kills foodborn e illnesses. I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercooked.

Chris: It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to ea t. It’s easy to gauge when meat is done. How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?

Ruth: No, I don’t want to take any chances. I’d rat her the steak is overcooked than undercooked. Are you going to eat that?

Chris: Yes, I like my steak juicy.

Ruth: But that’s raw!

Chris: No, it’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into  it so you can see that it’s cooked.

Ruth: It’s oozing red! That is definitely not cooke d.

Chris: I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this piece an d live to tell about it.

Ruth: Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re risking your health.

Chris: I think I’ll survive.

# Living on Low Wages

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,208 – Living on Low Wages.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,208. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Dylan and Yvonne  about living with not very much money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dylan: Here.

Yvonne: What’s this?

Dylan: It’s information about a job-training progra m. It’ll give you the skills you need to get steady work.

Yvonne: I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.

Dylan: You’re in a dead-end job straining to make e nds meet every month.

Yvonne: I’ve always landed on my feet.

Dylan: But you don’t have any job security. You cou ld be out on your ear any minute. Don’t you want a better quality of life?

Yvonne: My life is fine the way it is. I may not be  able to hold on to this job for long, but there will always be other ones.

Dylan: I wish I had your optimism. To hear you spea k, you’d think you were one of the privileged few.

Yvonne: It’s all in your outlook on life. I don’t h ave mortgages to pay, cars to maintain, jets to fuel, and employees to support.

 Dylan: You’re right. You should be counting your bl essings!

[end of dialogue]

Dylan begins our dialogue by giving something to Yv onne. He says, “Here.” This is sometimes a word we would use by itself when we are giving some object to another person. We are “handing” it, we might say, to another person. Yvonne takes what he is giving her and says, “What’s this?

Dylan says, “It’s information about a job-training program” – a program that will teach you skills to get a job. Dylan says, “It’ll g ive you the skills you need to get steady work.” “Steady (steady) work” is work that y ou can rely on, that you will be able to count on. For example, if you have a job wi th a company and the company always gives you 40 hours of work each week , you have “steady work.” You have work that you can rely on.

The opposite of “steady work” would be “seasonal wo rk,” or perhaps “temporary work.” Here in Los Angeles, if you are an actor, yo u often don’t have steady work. You may work for a month and then not have an y work for a couple of months and then work for a few weeks, and so forth.  If, however, you work on a television program that you know will be on for man y years, then you could say you have steady work. Steady work is something that  most of us have if we have a permanent job with a company.

Yvonne says, “I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.” “To get by” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning “I have enough money or resources to pay for what I need to pay for.” “To get by” mea ns you are able to pay for your food, and your rent, and your clothing, and your ce ll phone bill, and so forth. It doesn’t mean you’re getting rich, however. Yvonne s ays she gets by with the “wages” (wages) that she “earns” – that she gets – from her job.

“Wages” refer to money that you get for your work, especially when you are paid by the hour – that is, your company gives you 10 do llars for every hour you work, or 50 dollars for every hour you work. Many people have what are called “salaries” (salaries). A “salary” is when you are p aid a certain amount of money regardless of how many hours you work. You might wo rk 40 hours. You might work 60 hours. You get the same amount of money. Wi th wages, you are paid by the hour, typically. If you work more hours, you ge t more money.

Dylan says to Yvonne, “You are in a dead-end job st raining to make ends meet each month.” A “dead-end job” is a job that doesn’t  have any opportunities for

promotion or advancement. In other words, you’re ne ver going to get a better job in that company or doing what you’re doing. You’re always going to be doing the same thing. The verb “to strain” (strain) here mean s to try very hard to have something or to do something – to work very hard in  order to get something.

Dylan says Yvonne is “in a dead-end job straining t o make ends meet.” “To make ends (ends) meet (meet)” means to make enough money  to pay for your expenses. It’s similar to the phrasal verb “to get by.” So Dylan is saying that Yvonne is in this dead-end job and she is trying re ally hard, or having to work really hard, just to have enough money to live on. She is “straining to make ends meet.”

Yvonne says, however, “I’ve always landed on my fee t.” “To land (land) on your feet” is an expression that means even in a difficu lt situation, I always have success, or perhaps, I’m always lucky. If someone l oses his job but has a lot of skills or perhaps knows a lot of people, we could s ay that he will land on his feet. He won’t land on his head and kill himself or hurt himself, metaphorically. He will land on his feet. He will be able to stumble or fal l but get up again and be successful.

If you jump off a building and land on your feet, y ou’ll be able to continue living and walking and breathing, but if you land on your head, you might kill yourself. So, you definitely want to land on your feet. Yvonn e says she always lands on her feet even when she has difficult circumstances to deal with. Dylan says, “But you don’t have any job security” (security). “Job s ecurity” is confidence that you will have your job in the future, that you are not going to lose your job.

Dylan says, “You could be out on your ear any minut e.” The expression “to be out on your ear” (ear) means to lose your job, to b e fired. You can imagine, I suppose, someone throwing you out of the building a nd throwing you down to the ground – that would be literally “landing on your e ar.” Dylan says basically that Yvonne could be fired any minute. She doesn’t have very good job security. He says, “Don’t you want a better quality of life?” Th at is, “Don’t you want to be happier in your everyday life, in your everyday exi stence?”

Yvonne says, “My life is fine the way it is.” That means “My life is okay the way I am living it now.” “I may not be able to hold on to  this job for long,” she says, “but there will always be other ones,” meaning other job s. “To hold on to” something means to be able to keep something, to continue to have something even when it is difficult. “I’m trying to hold on to this job ev en though the boss doesn’t like me and I’m not very good at the job.” That’s my case h ere at the Center for

Educational Development. My boss is always trying t o fire me and I am trying to hold on to my job.

Dylan says, “I wish I had your optimism.” “Optimism ” (optimism) is the belief that things will be better in the future or that things will continue to be successful. The opposite of “optimism” is “pessimism” (pessimism). “Pessimism” is when you think everything is going to get worse. “Optimism” is when you think things will be good in the future or will continue to be good in t he future.

Dylan says, “To hear you speak, you’d think you wer e one of the privileged few.” What Dylan means here is if anyone would listen to you, they would think that you were one of the “privileged (privileged) few.” The “privileged few” refers to the small percentage of people who have a lot of mo ney or are very successful. In the United States, more recently, we’ve had the expression “the 1 percent,” meaning the very richest 1 percent in the country. They would be among the “privileged few.”

Yvonne says, “It’s all in your outlook on life.” your “outlook” (outlook) is the way you look at the world, the way you see things in ge neral – your perspective. It’s also, of course, the name of the email program in M icrosoft Office. But that’s different. “I don’t have mortgages to pay, cars to maintain, jets to fuel, and employees to support.” Yvonne is saying that she do esn’t have any burdens. She doesn’t have anything she needs to take care of in her life such as “mortgages” (mortgages). “Mortgages” are loans that you have to  either buy a house or to buy a car.

Yvonne says she doesn’t have any mortgages or loans . She doesn’t have any “cars to maintain” – that is, to keep in good runni ng order. She doesn’t have any “jets” (jets) to fuel. A “jet” is a fast airplane. Here it probably refers to a small airplane owned by a rich person. Yvonne says she do esn’t have to worry about fueling, or putting gasoline into, her own jet. Dyl an says, “You’re right,” meaning you are correct. “You should be counting your bless ings.”

“To count (count) your blessings” is an expression that means to recognize the good things in your life – to appreciate and be tha nkful for the good things you have in your life. It could be used by someone who has problems and is telling another person that he should be thankful for not h aving the problems that the person speaking has. It might also be used simply t o tell someone who is unhappy or complaining about his life that he shoul d be happier because he has good things. He should count his blessings.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Dylan: Here.

Yvonne: What’s this?

Dylan: It’s information about a job-training progra m. It’ll give you the skills you need to get steady work.

Yvonne: I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.

Dylan: You’re in a dead-end job straining to make e nds meet every month.

Yvonne: I’ve always landed on my feet.

Dylan: But you don’t have any job security. You cou ld be out on your ear any minute. Don’t you want a better quality of life?

# Questioning Mental Competency

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,209 – Questioning Mental Competency.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,209. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast courses in Business and Daily English, and I think you’ll enjo y them.

This episode is about people like me, who sometimes  can be a little crazy. We’re talking about whether someone is mentally competent  – whether they can think and behave rationally and logically. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: What are you doing with all those law books ? I thought you retired 20 years ago.

Ray: I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing .

Claire: Mental competency hearing? But your mind is  as sharp as it has ever been.

Ray: That’s not what my children think. They are go ing to court to prove my diminished capacity. They are going to argue that I  need a conservator for my estate.

Claire: Nobody who knows you would question your so und mind. There must be another reason for this hearing.

Ray: You’re right. My children want to get their ha nds on my money, and if they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgme nt, they will get power of attorney.

Claire: And if they get power of attorney . . .

Ray: They would get control of my company and my en tire estate.

Claire: So what are you going to do?

 Ray: I am going to fight fire with fire. I’m suing them.

Claire: What for?

Ray: Fraud, and I can make it stick. They’re both l acking in common sense. Everybody knows you should never sue an attorney, e specially a successful one!

[end of dialogue]

Claire begins our dialogue by asking Ray, “What are  you doing with all those law books? I thought you retired 20 years ago.” “To ret ire” means to leave your job, usually when you are older – say, 65 years or more.  Ray says, “I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing.” “Mental” (mental) re fers to your mind, to your ability to use your brain. “Competency” (competency ) refers to the ability to do something. A “hearing” (hearing) is an opportunity,  often in front of a judge in a courtroom, to make your case – to give the judge in formation so that the judge can make a decision.

Put it all together and we have “mental competency hearing,” which is a legal hearing – a legal meeting, if you will – in front of a judge, in which the judge is going to decide if a certain person has lost his ab ility to think rationally or clearly. If someone is “not mentally competent,” then differ ent rules apply, different laws apply to that person. For example, if you are not m entally competent, you may not be able to control your own money or even your own medical decisions. Ray says he’s preparing for his mental competency heari ng.

Claire is surprised at this. She says, “Mental comp etency hearing? But your mind is as sharp as it has ever been.” If you say someon e’s mind is “sharp” (sharp), or describe someone as “being sharp,” you mean the per son is able to think clearly and intelligently. The adjective can also mean to b e bright or intelligent or smart. Ray says, “That’s not what my children think.” In o ther words, Ray’s children think that he is no longer mentally competent, that  he cannot take care of himself.

“They are going to court” – that is, his children a re going to a judge – “to prove my diminished capacity.” “Diminished (diminished) c apacity (capacity)” is when you no longer have the ability to think as clearly as you did, so much so that you probably shouldn’t be handling your own affairs – t aking care of your business or personal affairs yourself. Ray says that his childr en “are going to argue” – they’re going to tell the judge – that he needs a “conserva tor for my estate.”

A “conservator” (conservator) is someone who takes care of another person’s legal and financial matters, especially when that p erson is no longer able to do it himself. So, if you are judged to be “mentally inco mpetent” – that is, not able to take care of your own affairs, your own financial a nd legal matters – the judge, the government in effect, will give someone that po wer, and that person is called a “conservator.” Your “estate” (estate) here refers  to all of the money and things that you own.

Claire says, “Nobody who knows you would question,”  would doubt, “your sound mind.” “To have a sound (sound) mind” is to be ment ally competent. We have an expression “to be of sound mind” – that is, you are  logical, rational. You are able to think clearly. If you are going to sign a contra ct or enter into a legal agreement, you must be “of sound mind.” If you are not, then t he agreement is invalid. That is, you can’t enter into a legal contract if you are not mentally competent. Even though a lot of people enter into legal contracts t hat are pretty stupid, that isn’t quite the same thing.

Claire says, “There must be another reason for this  hearing.” Ray says, “You’re right. My children want to get their hands on my mo ney.” The expression “to get your hands (hands) on” something means you want to get control of something. “To get your hands on someone’s money” means to tak e someone’s money or get control of someone’s money.

A beautiful young woman who marries a rich old man maybe trying to get her hands on his money, or it could just be love. Yes, that’s it. It’s love. The same would be true, of course, of a young man and a rich  old woman. But let’s not talk about people here in Hollywood. Back to our story. Ray says that his children want to get their hands on his money. He says, “If they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgment, they will get  power of attorney.”

There are a couple of legal phrases or expressions here. The first one is “mental incapacitation.” We’ve already talked about “dimini shed capacity.” “Mental incapacitation” is when you are judged not to be ab le to think clearly. “To be incapable of” doing something is to be unable to do  something. So if you are “incapacitated,” you are unable to do a certain thi ng. You could be “physically incapacitated” – that is, unable to move your body of your own volition, of your own will – or you could be “mentally incapacitated. ”

If you are mentally incapacitated, it’s basically t he same as being “mentally incompetent.” You are unable to do what you need to  do. “To have impaired (impaired) judgment” means to be unable to make goo d, logical decisions. If you drink a lot of alcohol, for example, you may have “ impaired judgment.” People

who go to a bar on Friday night and drink a lot of alcohol, by the end of the night often have impaired judgment and tend to believe th at other people in the bar are more attractive than they really are.

Ray says that his children want to get “power of at torney” (attorney). The word “attorney” normally refers to a lawyer. The express ion “power of attorney,” however, refers to the legal authority that one per son has to represent another person in some sort of financial or legal decision or contract. If you have “power of attorney” for your parents, for example, you are  able to do everything your parents would be able to do financially and legally  in most cases. So you could go to a bank and open up a bank account in their na me if you have power of attorney.

Sometimes power of attorney gives you the right to make medical decisions for another person if the government decides that that person is mentally incapacitated. However, you can voluntarily give so meone power of attorney. My accountant has power of attorney before the governm ent to represent me on tax matters. You may give power of attorney to your hus band or wife in case you are unable to do something because you are mentally or physically incapacitated.

Claire says, “If they,” meaning Ray’s children, “ge t power of attorney . . .” Ray interrupts and says, “They would get control of my company and my entire estate.” Claire asks, “So what are you going to do? ” Ray responds, “I am going to fight fire with fire.” The expression “to fight fir e (fire) with fire” means to attack someone using the same methods or techniques that p erson is using to attack you. Ray says, “I’m suing them.” “To sue” (sue) som eone means to bring a legal case against someone in front of a judge.

Claire says, “What for?” meaning what are you suing  them for? Ray says, “Fraud, and I can make it stick.” “Fraud” (fraud) are lies or actions that are meant to trick another person, to fool another person, in order to  get this other person to give you his money. The expression “to make it stick” (s tick) means to demonstrate that it is true, to demonstrate that someone else i s wrong, especially if they are guilty of some sort of crime or offense against the  law.

Ray says, “They’re both lacking in common sense.” R ay is referring to his two children, saying they are “lacking (lacking) in com mon sense.” “To lack” means not to have something, to be without something. “Co mmon sense” refers to the normal ability of people to understand the world, t o make rational decisions about the world around them. Ray says, “Everybody knows y ou should never sue an attorney, especially a successful one.”

We find out in the last sentence that Ray himself i s a lawyer. He is an attorney, and he was a successful one. He’s saying that his c hildren aren’t very smart. They lack common sense because they are trying to s ue their own father who himself is an attorney. There is, however, another expression in English that we could use here that Ray may not like, which is: “A person who represents himself in court” – that is, a person who tries to be his o wn attorney, as Ray’s doing – “has a fool for a lawyer.” That is, it’s never a go od idea to try to be your own attorney, your own lawyer.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: What are you doing with all those law books ? I thought you retired 20 years ago.

Ray: I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing .

Claire: Mental competency hearing? But your mind is  as sharp as it has ever been.

Ray: That’s not what my children think. They are go ing to court to prove my diminished capacity. They are going to argue that I  need a conservator for my estate.

Claire: Nobody who knows you would question your so und mind. There must be another reason for this hearing.

Ray: You’re right. My children want to get their ha nds on my money, and if they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgme nt, they will get power of attorney.

Claire: And if they get power of attorney . . .

Ray: They would get control of my company and my en tire estate.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,210 – Small Town Charm.

This episode is a dialogue between Alisha and Ramon  about living in a small town, in a place that doesn’t have very many people . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alisha: Hey, you’re back from your vacation. Where did you go? New York City? Miami?

Ramon: I decided to spend my vacation in Maddievill e.

Alisha: Where is Maddieville? I’ve never heard of it.

Ramon: It’s a small town about a six-hour drive fro m here. I read about it being a throwback to the days of small shops and friendly n eighbors, with a charming old-fashioned main street. It was really nice.

Alisha: I’m not sure I’d want to travel back in tim e. It doesn’t sound very exciting.

Ramon: It wasn’t as lively as some places I could h ave gone, but I enjoyed the quaint shops, the unpretentious people, and the gen uine friendliness.

Alisha: What did you do for an entire week?

Ramon: I perused the shops, ate at the family-owned  restaurants, and learned about the quirky history of the town by shooting the breeze with the old-timers at the local bar.

Alisha: To each his own, but that sounds like dulls ville to me.

Ramon: Then I guess you wouldn’t want to go back wi th me this summer for their wine festival.

Alisha: Did you say wine? Maybe I shouldn’t dismiss  small town charm quite so quickly.

[end of dialogue]

Alisha says to Ramon, “Hey, you’re back from vacati on.” “You’re back” here means you have returned from your vacation. “Where did you go?” Alisha asks. “New York City? Miami?” Ramon answers, “I decided t o spend” – that is, to take – “my vacation in Maddieville.” Alisha says, “Where  is Maddieville? I’ve never heard of it,” meaning I have never heard that name.  I don’t know anything about it. Ramon says, “It’s a small town about a six-hour  drive from here.”

In American English, we often distinguish between a  city – a place with hundreds of thousands or millions of people, such as Los Ang eles, New York, San Francisco, and others – and a town, which is a plac e with a much smaller number of people. There isn’t an exact number we us e to distinguish between a city and a town. Most people would probably conside r a place with, say, 3,000 or 5,000 people or fewer as being a town. There are so me towns in the United States that have only a couple hundred people.

So it’s not clear what Ramon is talking about when he says he went to a “small town,” but we can guess it’s a place that has very few people. I myself have never lived in a small town, but I’ve been to many small towns. My sister moved to a small town of 3,000 people after she graduated  from college. She was a teacher in a town even smaller than that, that was near the small town where she lived. The town where she taught high school had on ly 500 people. That was a really small town.

Well, in our dialogue, the town is “a six-hour driv e” from wherever Alisha and Ramon are now. That means it takes six hours in a c ar to get there. Ramon says, “I read about it being a throwback to the days of s mall shops and friendly neighbors, with a charming old-fashioned main stree t.” Ramon read about this small town as being a “throwback” (throwback). A “t hrowback” is something from an earlier time, an earlier time in history, someth ing that reminds you of the past.

In this case, it’s a town that reminds you of the d ays before there were big cities, when there were just towns with small shops or stor es and “friendly neighbors” –

people who were nice to you. Not like a big city su ch as Los Angeles. Ramon says this small town has a “charming old-fashioned main street.” “Charming” (charming) is something that is attractive, somethi ng that might be described as being “cute” (cute).

“Old-fashioned” refers to something that is the opp osite of modern or contemporary. Something that is “old-fashioned” is something that is no longer popular nowadays. “Old-fashioned” might also refer to a set of beliefs or values that are no longer popular today. Some people use t he term “old-fashioned” in a negative way to describe something that is no longe r done and shouldn’t be done anymore. But here, “old-fashioned” is a good thing.  It’s referring to the way this small town looks, especially its “main street.”

The “main (main) street” of a town is the most impo rtant street in a town. In fact, in many small towns, the most important street wher e you find all the shops, all the stores, is actually called “Main Street.” And t here are hundreds of thousands of Main Streets in the United States. There’s a Mai n Street in Santa Monica. There’s a Main Street in Culver City. There’s a Mai n Street here in Los Angeles. Some of these still are the most important streets in those areas. But here, he (Ramon) is using the term just to refer to the most  important street, the busiest street, the biggest street in this small town.

Alisha says, “I’m not sure I’d want to travel back in time.” “To travel back in time” means to experience things the way they were in the  past. Alisha says, “It doesn’t sound very exciting.” Ramon says, “It wasn’ t” – that is, it was not – “as lively as some places I could have gone, but I enjo yed the quaint shops, the unpretentious people, and the genuine friendliness. ” Ramon says this town wasn’t as “lively” (lively). “Lively” means with a lot of energy or movement or excitement.

Ramon describes the shops, the stores, as being “qu aint” (quaint). Something that is “quaint” is something that is attractive – a little unusual, a little old- fashioned perhaps, but still something you enjoy. “ Unpretentious” (unpretentious) refers to a person who is modest, who doesn’t try t o impress other people, who doesn’t try to seem like he is smarter or more inte lligent or more important than other people around him.

“To be genuine” (genuine) means to be real, to be t rue. It’s the opposite of being fake or phony or false. Someone who is “genuine” is  someone who doesn’t pretend to be someone else, who doesn’t act differe ntly depending on who he is with. Ramon finds that this small town had unpreten tious people and genuine

friendliness. Alisha says, “What did you do for an entire week?” That is, what did you do for the seven days you were there?

Ramon says, “I perused the shops, ate at family-own ed restaurants, and learned about the quirky history of the town by shooting the breeze with the old-timers at the local bar.” “To peruse” (peruse) means to look at, examine, or in some cases read something very carefully, paying attention to all of the little details. So, “to peruse a shop” means to go into a store and look ve ry carefully at everything that is in it. Ramon says he also learned about the “qui rky (quirky) history of the town.”

Something that is “quirky” is something that is unu sual or strange or perhaps unexpected, but in a fun way, in a good way. “To sh oot (shoot) the breeze” (breeze) means to have an informal conversation wit h someone, without any clear purpose. If you see your neighbor, the person  who lives next to you, you may ask how he’s doing, talk about the weather, tal k about something going on in your neighborhood. You’re “shooting the breeze.”  You’re just talking to be nice, to be friendly. You don’t have any real purpose in your conversation.

Ramon was shooting the breeze with some “old-timers ” at the bar in this town. An “old-timer” is someone who has lived in a partic ular place for a long time. Someone who is, I don’t know, 70 or 80 years old an d has lived in a town or a city his whole life would certainly be considered a n “old-timer.” Someone who could tell you a lot about that particular place.

Alisha doesn’t quite understand why Ramon went to t his town. She says, “To each his own, but that sounds like dullsville to me .” The expression “to each his own” means each person has his own likes, his own wants, and not everyone may like what that person likes. I may like drinkin g wine. You may like drinking beer. There is no right or wrong. Each person has h is own preferences, own interest. Obviously Alisha doesn’t like this idea of going to a small town.

She says, “That sounds like dullsville (dullsville) .” “Dullsville” is a funny word that means a very boring, uninteresting place or situati on. Ramon responds, “Then I guess you wouldn’t want to go back with me this sum mer for their wine festival.” A “festival” (festival) is some sort of celebration  or party, often organized by a community or a town. In this case, this town is going to have a wine festival. Now Ramon has gotten Alisha interested. She says, “Did you say wine?” She’s obviously someone who likes to drink wine.

She says, “Maybe I shouldn’t dismiss small town cha rm quite so quickly.” “To dismiss” (dismiss) means to decide to ignore someth ing, to not pay attention to

something, or to think something is not very import ant and therefore not pay attention to it. Alisha says, “Maybe I shouldn’t di smiss small town charm,” meaning even though before she thought this small t own was going to be uninteresting, if they have a wine festival, she mi ght want to go to it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alisha: Hey, you’re back from your vacation. Where did you go? New York City? Miami?

Ramon: I decided to spend my vacation in Maddievill e.

Alisha: Where is Maddieville? I’ve never heard of it.

Ramon: It’s a small town about a six-hour drive fro m here. I read about it being a throwback to the days of small shops and friendly n eighbors, with a charming old-fashioned main street. It was really nice.

Alisha: I’m not sure I’d want to travel back in tim e. It doesn’t sound very exciting.

Ramon: It wasn’t as lively as some places I could h ave gone, but I enjoyed the quaint shops, the unpretentious people, and the gen uine friendliness.

Alisha: What did you do for an entire week?

Ramon: I perused the shops, ate at the family-owned  restaurants, and learned about the quirky history of the town by shooting the breeze with the old-timers at the local bar.

Alisha: To each his own, but that sounds like dulls ville to me.

Ramon: Then I guess you wouldn’t want to go back wi th me this summer for their wine festival.

Alisha: Did you say wine? Maybe I shouldn’t dismiss  small town charm quite so quickly.

# Watching Movie and TV Franchises

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,211 – Watching Movie and TV Franchises.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,211. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store, with courses in Business and Daily English. If you want to improve your English even faster than you are now, then our ESLPod Special Courses are for you.

This episode is a dialogue between Ursula and Ian a bout watching movies and TV shows that are based on similar stories and simi lar characters. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ursula: Weren’t you watching this same movie yester day?

Ian: No, this is the sequel. Yesterday, I watched A ims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.

Ursula: Wasn’t this originally a TV show?

Ian: Actually, it was originally a novel, which was  adapted into a long-running TV show. Then, it was turned into a movie franchise. T he new installment is coming out next month and I can’t wait!

Ursula: The latest installment? I thought it was ju st a trilogy.

Ian: No, the original film has spawned four sequels  and two prequels so far.

Ursula: So you’re watching all the films again?

Ian: That’s right, but I’m not stopping there. I’m watching all of the TV show episodes again, too. And if I have time, I’ll even watch the spin-off.

Ursula: Spin-off? I didn’t know there had been a sp in-off.

Ian: There was. Aims Pond’s brother got his own sho w: Jaime Pond: Building Inspector. It wasn’t very successful.

Ursula: I guess we can call you a superfan.

Ian: That’s right. I’m a superfan of the super spy!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about “franchises” (franchises) . “Franchises” are films, television shows, video games, and other products t hat all have the same characters and the same or similar stories. You can  think of, for example, the Star Wars franchise – there are many different Star  Wars movies – or perhaps the Jason Bourne franchise. There are novels with J ason Bourne and then there were movies with Jason Bourne. These are all part of a “franchise” – a similar set of stories and characters.

Ursula begins our dialogue by saying, “Weren’t you watching this same movie yesterday?” Ian says, “No, this is the sequel (sequ el).” A “sequel” is a show or a movie that continues the story from the previous sh ow or movie. So you have the first Star Wars movie and then you have a sequel, w hich continues the story. It tells you what happens after the end of the first m ovie, in effect.

Nowadays we also have what are called “prequels” (p requels). A “prequel” is a show or a movie that says, or tells you, what happe ns before the original movie. And of course, Star Wars has sequels and prequels. Star Trek, another popular franchise that began as a television show and then became a set of movies, has prequels and sequels also.

Ian is watching a sequel. He says, “Yesterday, I wa tched Aims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.” A “spy” (spy) is a person wh ose job it is to discover secrets of another country or even another company.  Ursula says, “Wasn’t this originally a TV show?” That is, wasn’t this story f irst on a TV show before it was in a movie. Ian says, “Actually, it was originally a novel.” A “novel” (novel) is, of course, a fictional book. Harry Potter was original ly a character in the novels which were later made into movies.

Another way of saying “made into” is “adapted (adap ted) into.” You can have a story that begins as a novel that is “adapted into a movie” – or in the case of our dialogue, “adapted into a long-running TV show.” “L ong-running” means it was on television for many years, in this case. “Then,” Ia n says, “it was turned into a movie franchise.” “To be turned into” here means so mething similar to “to be

made into” or “to be adapted into.” It just means t o be changed into something. In this case, the TV show was turned into a movie fran chise.

Ian says, “The new installment is coming out next m onth and I can’t wait.” The “new installment” (installment) is the new, in this  case, “movie.” The “new installment” is the new part or the new version of some television show, movie, or book series. “The new installment is coming out,” m eaning it will be released. You will be able to watch it next month.

“The latest installment?” Ursula asks. “I thought it was a trilogy.” A “trilogy” (trilogy) is a group of three related books, movies , or stories. The Lord of the Rings was a trilogy. There were three parts to it. There was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. T hose three movies were part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Ursula is confused because she thought that the ser ies that Ian was watching with Aims Pond was a trilogy, and therefore there w ere no more installments to be released. Ian says, “No, the original film has s pawned four sequels and two prequels so far.” The verb “to spawn” (spawn) means  to produce or to generate. The verb is often used in cases like this when some thing produces or generates many different additional parts or additional insta llments. This original movie, according to Ian, “spawned four sequels and two pre quels.”

Ursula says, “So, you’re watching all the films aga in?” Ian says, “That’s right, but I’m not stopping there. I’m watching all of the TV show episodes again, too.” So Ian is going back and watching all of the movies th at are part of this franchise and the original TV episodes that came before the m ovies. “And,” he adds, “if I have time, I’ll even watch the spin-off.”

A “spin-off” (spin-off) is a product that is associ ated with the original show or movie – another show or movie typically that is bas ed on, or comes from, a story or a character in another book, TV show, or movie. “Spin-offs” were quite popular in the 1970s and ’80s in American television. If th ere was a very popular TV show, sometimes they would take one of the characte rs from that TV show and make a whole new show, an additional show based jus t on that character.

So for example, there was a popular TV show in the 1970s called All in the Family. Well, that was such a popular TV show that the television studio, the company that made that TV show, decided to produce a new show that was based on one of the characters in that show called George Jefferson. And so we had a show called The Jeffersons. And then I think there might have been a spin- off from that show as well.

 Sometimes you have spin-offs of spin-offs – televis ion shows that take characters from other television shows. Spin-offs can also happen in the movie industry, where a character from a popular movie ge ts his or her own movie. Ursula says, “Spin-off? I didn’t know there had bee n a spin-off.” Ian says, “There was. Aims Pond’s brother got his own show: Jaime Po nd: Building Inspector. It wasn’t very successful.”

Ian is talking about this fictional franchise that he is watching. It’s based on a character named Aims Pond. Well, Aims Pond has a br other, and that brother got his own spin-off movie, “Jaime Pond: Building Inspe ctor.” A “building inspector” is a person who has the job of going into a building o r a house and making sure that it is safe. Ian says the spin-off wasn’t very successful.

Ursula says, “I guess we can call you a superfan.” A “superfan” is a person who is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about someth ing. If you, for example, love watching all of the Game of Thrones TV shows, but you also read about them and you go back and read all the books and you  follow the different bloggers about that particular series, you might be  a superfan. You love that series so much that you want to know everything abo ut it.

Ian says, “That’s right. I’m a superfan of the supe r spy!” The word “super” (super) is often used to mean great or wonderful. It can al so mean, as it does here, the best of a certain category. So a “super spy” would be one of the best spies in the world. Ian is a “superfan” of the “super spy,” Aims  Pond, who should not be confused with the character James Bond. That’s a co mpletely different franchise.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Ursula: Weren’t you watching this same movie yester day?

Ian: No, this is the sequel. Yesterday, I watched A ims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.

This episode is a dialogue between Max and Grace ab out providing “tech,” or “technical,” support. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Max: Hello, hello, is this call-in tech support?

Grace: Yes, my name is Grace and this is the help d esk. How can I help you today?

Max: I’m having a problem with my machine and I don ’t know what to do.

Grace: Have you tried reading our online troublesho oting guide or asking your question on the support forum?

Max: The what?

Grace: Never mind. Can you describe the problem you ’re having?

Max: It doesn’t work.

Grace: I understand that. What exactly is the malfu nction?

Max: It’s not working.

Grace: For me to diagnose whether it’s a software o r hardware problem, I’ll need more information. Unfortunately, I can’t repair it remotely.

Max: Okay, I understand.

Grace: Good. We offer all kinds of support, from se tup to customization to disaster recovery, but I can’t do anything if I don ’t understand the problem.

Max: Okay.

Grace: Could you walk me through what happens when you turn on the machine?

Max: Nothing.

Grace: Nothing? Nothing at all?

Max: Zip, zilch, zero.

Grace: Sir, is the machine plugged in?

Max: Oh, it needs to be plugged in?

[end of dialogue]

We are listening to a telephone conversation in tod ay’s dialogue. Max calls the “tech support,” or “technical support,” department of a company. “Tech support” refers to the people who help you with some problem  usually related to your computer or a piece of software – a computer progra m or application on your computer.

Max says, “Hello, hello, is this call-in tech suppo rt?” “Call-in” refers to someone who is calling by telephone to get help on somethin g. Max is calling the tech support department. He’s not emailing them or going  in and visiting them in person. Grace says, “Yes, my name is Grace and this  is the help desk.” The “help desk” is the department that provides tech su pport and other assistance at a company. The help desk might also answer your que stions about “billing” – that is, paying for your software or some service you are getting.

Grace says, “This is the help desk. How can I help you today?” Max responds, “I’m having a problem with my machine and I don’t k now what to do.” His “machine,” here, is his computer. Grace says, “Have  you tried reading our online troubleshooting guide?” “Online” means on the inter net, on the web. “Troubleshooting” (troubleshooting) – all one word – refers to the process of identifying the cause or reason for a problem and f inding a solution for it. Many websites have a “troubleshooting guide” that will h elp you find the answer to the question you have or a solution to the problem you have.

 Grace also asks Max if he’s asked a “question on the support forum” (forum). A “support forum” is a website or message board on wh ich people put questions and other people put answers. Some big companies ha ve support forums where you can go and ask a question and another person, o ften another person who uses the same application or the same computer, wil l be able to answer that question.

Max is confused by Grace’s question. He says, “The what?” He doesn’t know what Grace is talking about when she refers to the “troubleshooting guide” and the “support forum.” Grace says, “Never mind.” This  is a very common expression in English, “Never mind.” It’s a phrase that we use to show that we don’t need an answer to the question we just asked or simply to indicate that something is not important enough to repeat. Grace is telling Max to forget about the question she just asked.

Instead, Grace asks another question. She says, “Ca n you describe the problem you’re having?” Max says, “It doesn’t work.” Well, this doesn’t help very much. Max says, “It doesn’t work.” Well, what doesn’t wor k? What do you mean it doesn’t work? Max is not giving a very good descrip tion of this problem.

But Grace is very patient. She says, “I understand that. What exactly is the malfunction?” A “malfunction” (malfunction) is when  something doesn’t work correctly, when it doesn’t function correctly. “Fun ction” is another word here for “work,” as in “operate,” as in “do what it’s suppos ed to do.” But we still don’t know what exactly is the problem. And Max doesn’t help v ery much. He says, “It’s not working.” Well, once again, this is not a very good  answer since we don’t know what Max is talking about.

Grace says, “For me to diagnose whether it’s a soft ware or hardware problem, I’ll need more information.” The verb “to diagnose” (dia gnose) means to identify the cause or the reason for a problem. It is often used  in medicine by doctors. Doctors “diagnose” the illness or the disease that patients have. The doctor tries to figure out what is wrong with you. That is the p rocess of “diagnosing” the illness.

Tech support people also diagnose problems. They tr y to find out why your computer software or your computer isn’t working co rrectly. That’s what Grace is trying to do. She’s trying to diagnose whether this  problem is related to “software” or “hardware.” “Software” (software) refers to comp uter applications, or what we now simply refer to as “apps” (apps). “Software” is  made by writing what is called

“code” (code), which is basically a set of instruct ions that tell your computer what to do. “Hardware” (hardware) refers to the physical  computer itself.

Grace says she needs more information from Max. “Un fortunately,” she says, “I can’t repair it remotely.” “To repair” (repair) mea ns to fix something that is broken. “Remotely” (remotely) means, here, “from a distance.” Many people nowadays work “remotely.” They don’t go to their co mpany, to the office where their company is located, to work. They work from t heir house or from a café. That’s working remotely. Grace says she cannot fix Max’s problem remotely – that is, from where she is now.

Max says, “Okay, I understand.” Grace says, “Good. We offer all kinds of support, from setup to customization to disaster re covery, but I can’t do anything if I don’t understand the problem.” Grace mentions some things that her tech support department does, including “setup” (setup).  “Setup,” as a noun, is the process of preparing a computer to use it for the f irst time.

“Customization” (customization) is when you change something so that it fits your particular needs or wishes. It does exactly what yo u want it to do. Often, software will come with certain features, certain things tha t it does, but you want it to only work in a certain way, so you go in and you change the software somehow so that it works exactly the way you want it to work f or what you want it to do. That’s “customization.”

“Disaster recovery” is usually the process of helpi ng you get your computer working again after a major problem. If you drop your computer into the water, for example, that would probably ruin your computer. It  would cause it to stop working. You might need “disaster recovery” in orde r to get the information off of your computer – the “data,” we would say, off of your computer. That’s an example of “disaster recovery,” I think.

Grace says, “Could you walk me through what happens  when you turn on the machine?” “To walk someone through” means to explai n something to someone else step-by-step, using very specific details abou t what is happening. If you ask someone “to walk you through a problem,” you’re ask ing the person to tell you exactly what happens first, and then second, and th en third, and so forth. Grace is asking Max to walk her through what happens when  he turns on the machine. Max says, “Nothing.”

Grace is confused. “Nothing? Nothing at all?” she s ays. Max says, “Zip, zilch, zero.” Grace is asking Max what happens when he tri es to turn the machine on, and Max says nothing happens. Grace is surprised th at nothing happens. Max

then says, “Zip, zilch, zero.” “Zip (zip), zilch (z ilch), zero (zero),” all mean the same thing: “nothing.” It’s an informal way to emph asize that nothing is happening. In the U.S. sometimes people use the Spa nish word nowadays, “nada” (nada), which also means “nothing.”

Grace says, “Sir, is the machine plugged in?” Notic e the use of the word “sir” (sir) here. It’s a formal way of addressing a man, of say ing something to a man. You might hear it in a formal business situation such a s this. Grace, after all, is working for a company, trying to help the company’s  customer.

Grace asks Max if the machine is “plugged (plugged)  in.” A computer and most machines nowadays require some sort of electrical p ower. You get that power either from the battery or from the electrical syst em in your house or building. You have to connect your computer to the electrical  system by using a long piece of wire. The verb we use to connect that wire to the electrical system is “to plug in.” You “plug in” your computer. You connect your computer to the electrical power in the building or house where you are.

Max says, “Oh, it needs to be plugged in?” Max does n’t realize that his computer needs electrical power, which of course means that Max isn’t all that intelligent. He’s not very bright. He’s kind of stupid, in other  words. Grace doesn’t say anything. She just sighs. She goes [sigh]. Grace ca n’t believe that Max didn’t even plug the computer in. That, of course, is Max’ s problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Max: Hello, hello, is this call-in tech support?

Grace: Yes, my name is Grace and this is the help d esk. How can I help you today?

Max: I’m having a problem with my machine and I don ’t know what to do.

Grace: Have you tried reading our online troublesho oting guide or asking your question on the support forum?

Max: The what?

Grace: Never mind. Can you describe the problem you ’re having?

 Max: It doesn’t work.

Grace: I understand that. What exactly is the malfu nction?

Max: It’s not working.

Grace: For me to diagnose whether it’s a software o r hardware problem, I’ll need more information. Unfortunately, I can’t repair it remotely.

Max: Okay, I understand.

Grace: Good. We offer all kinds of support, from se tup to customization to disaster recovery, but I can’t do anything if I don ’t understand the problem.

Max: Okay.

Grace: Could you walk me through what happens when you turn on the machine?

Max: Nothing.

Grace: Nothing? Nothing at all?

Max: Zip, zilch, zero.

Grace: Sir, is the machine plugged in?

Max: Oh, it needs to be plugged in?

This episode is a dialogue between Petra and Ken ab out trying to pay for something using different payment systems. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Petra: Damn! That didn’t work either.

Ken: What are you doing?

Petra: I’m trying to pay for a new service I ordere d, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment. I even tried my debit ca rd, but it’s been rejected, too.

Ken: Why don’t you just write a check and mail it i n?

Petra: I don’t have any checks. In this day and age , I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds transfer options.

Ken: What are going to do now?

Petra: I might try sending a wire, but my bank char ges a large fee for wires.

Ken: How about signing up for direct deposit?

Petra: If this were an ongoing service I would, but  this is a one-time thing. Do you think I could try your credit card?

Ken: I don’t know about that . . .

Petra: All right, if you feel funny about doing tha t then could you buy me a gift card for this website and then I can turn around an d use the balance?

Ken: That seems kind of involved. Would you pay me back in cash?

Petra: Of course. I will write you an IOU right now  and then go to the bank tomorrow.

Ken: How about if you go to the bank now. I’ll even  give you a ride.

Petra: Is that really necessary? We don’t even know  if it’s going to work.

Ken: When it comes to money, I always say “better s afe than sorry.”

[end of dialogue]

Petra begins our dialogue a little angry, so angry he uses a “swear (swear) word.” A “swear word” is a word you use when you are angry that is not a very nice word, not a word you should use in front of ch ildren or your boss. Petra says, “Damn! That didn’t work either.” The swear wo rd here, of course, is “damn” (damn). It’s a word some people use when they are f rustrated or angry. Petra seems to be angry because something didn’t work.

Petra explains, “I’m trying to pay for a new servic e I ordered, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment.” Petra is b uying something on the web, on the internet, but the website she is using won’t  accept her credit card as payment. A “credit card,” you probably know, is a s mall plastic card that you can use to pay for things. There are a couple of large companies that have credit cards you can use, including MasterCard and Visa as  well as several others. You can use your credit card on the internet as well by  putting the numbers of your card into the website.

Petra says this website won’t accept her credit car d as “payment” – that is, money that you give to someone from whom you are bu ying something. Petra says, “I even tried my debit (debit) card.” A “debi t card” is a card that takes money directly out of your bank account. A “credit card” is when you buy something and a company, a bank, lends you money, b asically, until you pay it back. If you pay it back within 30 days, usually the bank will not charge you any money. When you use a credit card, you are essentia lly making a series of loans from the bank, and these are loans that you have to  pay back.

If you don’t pay them back, the bank will charge yo u interest. That’s what we call a “finance (finance) charge.” Some people have to p ay lots of money every month in “finance charges” because they don’t have enough money to pay for the loans that they took out that month from their cred it card company. We don’t usually call them “loans.” We call them “charges” ( charges). When you call them “charges,” people don’t think of them as loans anym ore. This is a very smart way that credit card companies get you to spend more mo ney.

Anyway, Petra is angry because she hasn’t been able  to use either her credit card or her debit card. She says, “The debit card h as been rejected” (rejected). When your credit card is “rejected,” you are not al lowed to use it. Another word here would be “denied” (denied). If your credit car d is “denied,” you are not able to use it. The bank is saying, “No, you can’t use it.” Ken says, “Why don’t you just write a check and mail it in?” A “check” (check) is  a small piece of paper that you can use to take money out of your bank account.

Remember, a “debit card” is a way of electronically  taking money directly out of your bank account. A “check” is another way of taki ng money out of your bank account in order to give it to another person. The problem is that Petra doesn’t have any checks. This isn’t that unusual nowadays. Many people don’t have paper checks anymore because they pay for everythin g either with a credit card or a debit card or some other way of paying electro nically.

In fact, that’s exactly what Petra says. “In this d ay and age,” she says, “I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds tra nsfer options.” The expression “in this day and age” means nowadays or in modern t imes, I guess you might say. She’s saying she should be able to use an elec tronic funds transfer option. “Electronic Funds Transfer” is moving money between  two bank accounts or two different financial accounts without using any pape r money or any paper checks.

Ken says, “What are you going to do now?” Petra say s, “I might try sending a wire, but my bank charges a large fee for wires.” A  “wire” (wire) is when you send money electronically between two banks. It’s a part icular way of sending especially large amounts of money between two banks . This can be more expensive because banks often charge or make you pa y a large fee, a large amount of money, for wires.

Ken says, “How about signing up for direct deposit? ” “Direct deposit” is another way of electronically transferring money from one b ank account to another. Usually “direct deposit” is the term we use when your company pays you by giving you money not with a paper check, but by dep ositing or putting that money directly into your bank account. In other words, the money is transferred from

your company’s bank account to your bank account. H owever, sometimes this term is used to describe the way people pay their b ills electronically.

For example, every month I have to pay the gas comp any the money that I owe them. But I don’t send them a check. I have that mo ney directly withdrawn, or taken from my bank account, and put into their bank  account. That arrangement can also be called sometimes a “direct deposit paym ent.” I’m not sending the company, the gas company, money through the mail. I ’m paying them electronically from my bank account to their bank a ccount.

Petra says, “If this were an ongoing service, I wou ld. But this is a one-time thing.” An “ongoing (ongoing) service” is one that continue s over a long period of time, one that repeats every month or every six months or  every week, even. Petra doesn’t want to use a direct deposit system because  “this is a one-time thing.” “One-time” means it is only going to happen a singl e time. It is only happening once. “Do you think I could try your credit card?” Petra asks. Ken says, “I don’t know about that.” Ken doesn’t want Petra using his credit card to buy this thing over the internet.

Petra says, “All right. If you feel funny about doi ng that,” meaning if you don’t think it’s a good idea, you think it’s strange, or you feel uncomfortable about it, “then could you buy me a gift card for this website  and then I can turn around and use the balance?” A “gift card” is usually a small plastic card like a credit card that you buy for someone else so that that person can use it to buy things at a certain store. So, you go to a big store and you bu y a $50 gift card for someone. That person can then buy something at that store, b ut only at that store, using that $50 gift card.

Gift cards now can also be used electronically. Tha t’s what Petra is suggesting that Ken do for her. She will then use this gift ca rd that Ken buys her to buy something on that website. That’s what she means by  the expression “use the balance” (balance). The “balance” refers to the amo unt of money on the gift card, in this case. “Balance” can also refer to the amoun t of money you have in your bank account.

Ken says, “That seems kind of involved,” meaning th is seems a little complicated – too complicated. He then asks, “Would you pay me back in cash?” “To pay someone back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to  return the money that you borrowed from someone else. If I loan you $100, I e xpect you to pay me back – to give that money back to me in the future. Ken as ks if Petra is going to pay him back “in cash” – that is, in paper money.

Petra says, “Of course. I will write you an IOU rig ht now and then go to the bank tomorrow.” An “IOU” is a piece of paper, usually, w ith the three letters I, O, and U. “IOU” means “I owe (owe) you (you)” money. It’s a way of indicating that you have borrowed money from someone and that you are p romising to pay it back. That’s not the same, of course, as getting the mone y back in cash, which is what Ken wants.

Ken says, “How about if you go to the bank now. I’l l even give you a ride.” Ken says to Petra, “I will drive you to the bank so you  can get this money for me and give it to me right now instead of waiting until to morrow.” Petra says, “Is that really necessary? We don’t even know if it’s going to work.” Petra doesn’t think it’s necessary that they go and get the money right  away. Ken says, “When it comes to money,” meaning when we’re talking about o r dealing with money, “I always say ‘better safe than sorry.’”

This is an old expression, “better safe (safe) than  sorry (sorry).” This expression means that it is better to spend some extra time an d do something so that you don’t hurt yourself or take any unnecessary risks, because if you don’t take that extra time – if you are not safe – then later you c ould be sorry. You could get hurt, and therefore you will be not very happy. So,  it’s better to be cautious. It’s better to be safe – to move slowly, to do things ve ry carefully – rather than moving quickly or carelessly and getting hurt or ge tting injured.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Petra: Damn! That didn’t work either.

Ken: What are you doing?

Petra: I’m trying to pay for a new service I ordere d, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment. I even tried my debit ca rd, but it’s been rejected, too.

Ken: Why don’t you just write a check and mail it i n?

Petra: I don’t have any checks. In this day and age , I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds transfer options.

Ken: What are going to do now?

Petra: I might try sending a wire, but my bank char ges a large fee for wires.

 Ken: How about signing up for direct deposit?

Petra: If this were an ongoing service I would, but  this is a one-time thing. Do you think I could try your credit card?

Ken: I don’t know about that . . .

Petra: All right, if you feel funny about doing tha t then could you buy me a gift card for this website and then I can turn around an d use the balance?

Ken: That seems kind of involved. Would you pay me back in cash?

Petra: Of course. I will write you an IOU right now  and then go to the bank tomorrow.

Ken: How about if you go to the bank now. I’ll even  give you a ride.

Petra: Is that really necessary? We don’t even know  if it’s going to work.

Ken: When it comes to money, I always say “better s afe than sorry.”

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,214 – Experiencing Dread.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,214. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about dread – of not wan ting to do something because of the fear of what might happen. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Brianna: Are you still here? I thought you left age s ago.

Viktor: There’s no rush. I’m thinking of postponing  until tomorrow.

Brianna: Why?

Viktor: I feel a sense of foreboding. I have a snea king suspicion that things aren’t going to go well.

Brianna: Under the circumstances, I can understand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done quickly.

Viktor: I’m not sure about that. I have a feeling t hat things are going to go very, very wrong, and the longer I can put it off the bet ter.

Brianna: Next week is your girlfriend’s birthday. You don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you?

Viktor: No, that would be cruel. Maybe I should hol d off until after next week.

Brianna: You’re really dreading breaking up with he r, aren’t you?

Viktor: She’s got a temper. When I told her that I couldn’t join her on a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic, an d I have dents in my car door to show for it. I expect this to be much, much wors e.

Brianna: Ah, I see. I never liked the idea of break ing up with someone remotely, but it might be called for in this case.

[end of dialogue]

Brianna asks Viktor, “Are you still here? I thought  you left ages ago.” “Ages (ages) ago (ago)” means here “a long time ago.” Vik tor says, “There’s no rush,” meaning there’s no hurry. There’s no reason for me to leave right away or immediately. In fact, Viktor says, “I’m thinking of  postponing until tomorrow.” “To postpone” (postpone) means to do something later, n ot to do it now. Another verb here we could use is “to delay” (delay).

Brianna asks Viktor why he’s thinking of postponing  until tomorrow. Viktor says, “I feel a sense of foreboding.” “Foreboding” (forebodi ng) is not a common word in English conversation. It means an anxious feeling t hat something bad will happen. You have a sense, a feeling, an emotion tha t something bad will happen in the future. Viktor says, “I have a sneaking susp icion that things aren’t going to go well.”

A “sneaking (sneaking) suspicion (suspicion)” is a belief that something bad will happen. It’s very similar to this idea of “forebodi ng.” The word “foreboding” is usually used when something really bad is going to happen, something perhaps even evil. “Sneaking suspicion” is usually used in a less serious situation, where you know something is bad or you know something not  good may happen, but it’s not going to be something terrible.

Sometimes we use this expression “sneaking suspicio n” when you think another person is hiding something from you or you think th at something is going on that shouldn’t be going on. “I have a sneaking suspicion  that Bill isn’t really sick today. He decided to go to the beach with his girlfriend. That’s why he’s not here at work.” That would be an example of using that expre ssion when there isn’t something horrible that is happening or going to ha ppen.

Brianna says, “Under the circumstances, I can under stand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done qui ckly.” “Reluctance” (reluctance) is a hesitation or unwillingness to do something. You’ re not sure you really want to do it. You sort of wait and stop and think “Hmm, sh ould I really do this?” That’s a

“reluctance,” an unwillingness to do something. Bri anna can understand Viktor’s reluctance. “But,” she says, “it’s like ripping off  a bandage” (bandage).

 A “bandage” is something you put on your skin when  you cut yourself. You put it over the cut. “To rip off a bandage” is to take it off your skin quickly. Of course, you take off a bandage quickly so that it doesn’t h urt as much, or you get the pain over in a very short period of time. That’s what Br ianna is suggesting that Viktor do. Obviously Viktor is thinking about something th at he doesn’t want to do that will be painful, and that’s why it’s best to do it quickly, Brianna says.

Viktor disagrees. He says, “I’m not sure about that . I have the feeling,” meaning I think or I believe, “that things are going to go ve ry, very wrong.” For something “to go very, very wrong” is for bad things to happe n as a result of whatever you’re going to do or whatever someone else is going to do . Viktor believes “The longer I can put it off, the better.” The two-word phrasal  verb “to put something off” means the same as “to postpone” or “to delay” – to do something later, usually because you don’t want to do it now.

Brianna says, “Next week is your girlfriend’s birth day. You don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you?” Now we learn wha t Viktor is worried about. He wants to break up with his girlfriend. “To break up  with” someone is to end a romantic relationship with someone, usually someone  that you are not married to yet, someone you are “dating,” we would say.

Viktor says, “No.” He doesn’t want to break up with  his girlfriend on her birthday. “That would be cruel” (cruel). “Cruel” is very mean , very inconsiderate, we might say. “Cruel” is actually more than inconsiderate. I t’s something that really hurts another person. Viktor says, “Maybe I should hold o ff until after next week.” “To hold off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to wai t to do something later. It’s similar to “to delay” or “to postpone.”

Brianna says, “You’re really dreading breaking up w ith her, aren’t you?” “To dread” (dread) means to not want to do something be cause you are worried or afraid about what might happen. “I dread talking to  my mother-in-law.” I don’t really want to. I have a feeling that it’s not goin g to be very pleasant. Perhaps I’m even fearful of what might happen. You might dread taking a test at school because you know you may not do very well on it. Yo u’re fearful about what will happen. Brianna thinks that Viktor is dreading brea king up with his girlfriend.

Viktor apparently is dreading breaking up with her,  in part because he says she has a temper. Viktor says, “She’s got a temper.” “S he’s got a temper” means the same as “she has a temper.” “To have a temper” (tem per) means to lose control

of your emotions easily, to be someone who often ge ts upset and angry. We often think of a young child as having a “temper” i f the child gets angry easily. But adults also have a temper. Someone who easily gets upset at things or starts yelling at other people because something goes wron g is someone who has a temper.

Viktor says, “When I told her I couldn’t join her o n a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic.” Viktor told his girlfriend that he could not go with her when she was going to visit her parents la st weekend. When this happened, Viktor says, the girlfriend “went ballist ic” (ballistic). The phrasal verb “to go ballistic” means to become extremely angry a nd to lose control of your emotions – to start shouting and screaming, for exa mple.

Viktor says he has dents in his car door to show for it. A “dent” (dent) is a small section of something that has been pushed in, that is no longer flat or smooth. If you have a car and someone hits your car – the side  of your car, especially – you will probably get a dent in the side of your car. T he metal will go in. There will be what we call an “indentation.” Well, it’s obvious t hat Viktor’s girlfriend got so angry at him that she hit his car and caused a dent . That’s what happens when she goes ballistic, I guess.

This is what Viktor has “to show for it.” The expre ssion “to show for it” means to have as a result of something else happening. He sa ys, “I expect this to be much, much worse,” meaning if he breaks up with her , she will get even more angry. Brianna says, “Ah, I see,” meaning “Yes. I u nderstand.” “I never liked the idea of breaking up with someone remotely, but it m ight be called for in this case.”

To do something “remotely” (remotely) is to do it f rom a distance. Many people now work remotely. They don’t go into their office.  They stay at home and work on their computer and use the internet to communica te with other people. That’s “working remotely.” Brianna is suggesting perhaps t hat Viktor break up with his girlfriend “remotely” – maybe send her a text messa ge or tweet her or put something on his Facebook page like “Now I’m single .”

In any case, Brianna thinks that breaking up with t he girlfriend remotely might be “called for in this case.” “To be called for” means  to be appropriate, to be necessary or required in this particular situation.  I have to say, I never had a difficult breakup with my girlfriends. Usually they  broke up with me, so I didn’t have to worry about it too much until after it happ ened.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Brianna: Are you still here? I thought you left age s ago.

Viktor: There’s no rush. I’m thinking of postponing  until tomorrow.

Brianna: Why?

Viktor: I feel a sense of foreboding. I have a snea king suspicion that things aren’t going to go well.

Brianna: Under the circumstances, I can understand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done quickly.

Viktor: I’m not sure about that. I have a feeling t hat things are going to go very, very wrong, and the longer I can put it off the bet ter.

# A Fear of Heights

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,215 – A Fear of Heights.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,215. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Christine and As ahi about being afraid of heights – of being far above the ground. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Christine: Help me! I’m going to fall!

Asahi: You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you.

Christine: Sorry, I have a fear of heights. I somet imes have panic attacks when I’m high up off the ground.

Asahi: Okay, but we’re not very high up.

Christine: I know. My phobia is totally irrational.

Asahi: That explains a lot, like why you live on the ground floor of your apartment building and why you didn’t want to go hiking near the cliffs.

Christine: That’s right. I try to avoid any situati ons that will trigger my fear.

Asahi: So how do you travel? Do you ever fly?

Christine: The one time I flew in an airplane I exp erienced vertigo and I hyperventilated until we landed. I was really agita ted because I thought I was going to die. It wasn’t pretty. That’s why I normal ly drive or take a train.

Asahi: So I’m guessing no skydiving for you.

 Christine: Not unless you want to find out how my s tomach reacts to heights!

[end of dialogue]

Christine begins our dialogue by yelling, “Help me!  I’m going to fall!” “To fall” (fall) means for your body to go down and hit the ground q uickly and unexpectedly. You could fall just by walking down the street, or you could be up high – on the top of a building or on a ladder or just on a chair  – and fall down. “To fall” and “to fall down” mean something similar. The phrasal verb  “to fall down” is often used in the same way as the verb “to fall.” However, the  verb “to fall” can refer to things other than just people and objects. You can also talk about prices “falling,” or going down, reducing in value. But here we’re ta lking about poor Christine.

Asahi says, “You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you .” The expression “I’ve got you” means that I will protect you. I will protect you f rom injury or danger – from something bad happening to you. Often we use this w hen we’re actually holding on to another person. “I’ve got you. Don’t worry. Y ou’re not going to fall.” Christine apologizes. She says, “Sorry, I have a fe ar of heights” (heights). A “fear of heights” is when you are afraid of being far abo ve the ground. Some people, for example, don’t like to go up in a tall building  and look out because they have a “fear of heights.” They’re afraid even when there  is no danger of them falling down.

Christine says, “I sometimes have panic attacks whe n I am high up off the ground.” A “panic (panic) attack” is a sudden feeli ng of fear and anxiety, often without any logical or rational explanation. A pani c attack makes it difficult for a person to behave normally. Christine says she gets panic attacks when she is “high up off the ground” – that is, when she is in the air or on a raised surface, when she is perhaps on a ladder or on the top of the roof of a house or just high up in a building. If she’s “high up off the ground, ” she has panic attacks.

Asahi says, “Okay, but we’re not very high up,” mea ning we are not very far from the ground. Christine says, “I know. My phobia is t otally irrational.” If something is “irrational” (irrational), it is not rational, it i s not logical. It cannot be explained in any logical or reasonable way. A “phobia” (phobia) is normally a fear of something. If you have a phobia of something, you h ave an irrational fear of something.

Just because you are afraid of something, however, doesn’t mean it’s a phobia. It doesn’t mean it’s irrational. I have a fear of some one who has a gun killing me. That’s not an irrational fear if the person is poin ting the gun at you, if the person

is aiming the gun in your direction. A phobia is so mething that would be irrational – something you have no good reason to fear.

Asahi says, “That explains a lot, like why you live  on the ground floor of your apartment building.” The “ground (ground) floor” is  what we call in the United States also the “first floor.” It’s the floor or le vel of a building that you can walk into without going up any stairs or steps. That’s c alled the “ground floor” or the “first floor.” In other countries, the first floor is what we would call in the U.S. the “second floor.” That’s the floor that you get to by  going up steps or one set of stairs – “one flight of stairs,” we would say.

But in any case, Asahi understands now why Christin e lives on the ground floor of her apartment building: because she’s afraid of heights. He also understands why she didn’t go “hiking near the cliffs.” “To go hiking” (hiking) means to go walking outdoors, outside, usually for a long dista nce. “Cliffs” (cliffs) are very steep, rocky sides of a mountain that go almost str aight up and down. Sometimes next to, say, an ocean there are cliffs. The water has worn away the side so that there is a straight up-and-down surfac e right next to the water. That would be an example of a “cliff.”

Christine says, “That’s right,” meaning yes, that’s  why I don’t live above the ground floor and that’s why I don’t go hiking near cliffs. “I try to avoid any situations that will trigger my fear.” “To trigger”  (trigger) is to cause something else to happen, to cause an event or situation to o ccur. Interestingly enough, we call the part of the gun that you use your finger t o fire the gun the “trigger.” The “trigger” of the gun is the part of the gun that is  used to actually cause the bullet to go out of the gun. That’s a “trigger” as a noun.

As a verb, “to trigger” means to cause something el se to happen. You can understand the relationship, however, here between the noun and the verb, because you “trigger” the bullet from leaving the g un by – we use the verb “to pull” – by “pulling the trigger.” Asahi says, “So h ow do you travel? Do you ever fly?” Do you ever go up into an airplane?

Christine says, “The one time I flew in an airplane ” – that is, I went in an airplane up into the air – “I experienced vertigo and I hype rventilated until we landed. “Vertigo” (vertigo) is a feeling of dizziness, that  you’re going to fall over, when you are up for example on a ladder or any tall stru cture. You may have seen the great Alfred Hitchcock movie Vertigo – that’s what it’s called in English, anyway – precisely about a man who gets dizzy when he goes u p high, when he is high above the ground.

Christine says she experienced vertigo when she was  in an airplane, and because of that, she “hyperventilated.” “To hyperve ntilate” (hyperventilate) is to breathe very quickly and uncontrollably, especially  because you are very excited, or perhaps you are under some stress. “To hypervent ilate” can be dangerous, and it’s important if you are hyperventilating to t ry, of course, to breathe normally, to calm down. Christine says she hyperventilated “u ntil we landed” – that is, until the plane went back down onto the ground.

She says, “I was really agitated because I thought I was going to die.” “To be agitated” (agitated) is to be nervous, to be worrie d, or to be very excited but in a bad way. “It wasn’t pretty,” Christine says of her experience on the airplane. That phrase “It wasn’t pretty” doesn’t refer to how good -looking something or someone is; rather, it’s used to describe something that is  very unpleasant or uncomfortable or perhaps even embarrassing. Christi ne says, “That’s why I normally drive or take a train.” She doesn’t fly in  an airplane.

Asahi says, “So I’m guessing no skydiving for you.”  “Skydiving” (skydiving) is the sport of jumping out of an airplane, falling throug h the sky for a short period, and then opening what’s called a “parachute” (parachute ), which is like a large piece of fabric – well, it is a large piece of fabric – t hat slows you down so that you don’t kill yourself when you hit the ground. That’s  “skydiving,” and some people do that for fun. Not me. Not Christine, either, bec ause of course she’s afraid of heights.

Christine says, “Not unless you want to find out ho w my stomach reacts to heights.” “To react (react) to” something is to res pond to something. It’s how you behave or something behaves in a certain situation.  Christine is making a joke here. She’s saying that she would probably get sick  to her stomach if she went skydiving, because of course she’s afraid of height s. I’m not afraid of heights, really. Although I don’t think I would go skydiving  or close to a cliff.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Christine: Help me! I’m going to fall!

Asahi: You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you.

Christine: Not unless you want to find out how my s tomach reacts to heights!

# Working in a Job You Love

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,216 – Working in a Job You Love.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,216. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com. When you do, you can take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, with additional courses in Business and Daily Engli sh. This episode is a dialogue between Lorna and Deangelo about working somewhere you really love to work. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorna: It’s great to be alive, isn’t it?

Deangelo: What are you so happy about?

Lorna: I’m just happy to come to work.

Deangelo: What?!

Lorna: I’ve come to realize that this is more than a job. It’s a vocation. I’m doing valuable work that I’m well suited for.

Deangelo: Are you on something?

Lorna: I’m high on life and my newfound sense of pu rpose. I realize that I’m doing this job because I have a calling and this is  what I’m meant to do.

Deangelo: I’m serious. Are you coming down with som ething?

Lorna: Of course not. Yesterday, it occurred to me the legacy I’ll be leaving behind after my life’s work is done.

Deangelo: Life’s work?

Lorna: Yes, I’ll be remembered in posterity as some one who made a difference.

Deangelo: You do remember what you do for a living,  right?

 Lorna: I provide salve to people who need it. I giv e succor to those in need.

Deangelo: You serve drinks in a bar.

Lorna: I provide a shoulder to cry on, a calm voice  in a crazy world.

Deangelo: Talk about delusions of grandeur!

[end of dialogue]

Lorna begins our dialogue by saying to Deangelo, “I t’s great to be alive, isn’t it?” Lorna is very happy. She’s saying how wonderful it is to be alive. It is something you would say when you’re very happy. Deangelo says , “What are you so happy about?” Lorna responds, “I’m just happy to come to work.” Deangelo is shocked, very surprised by this answer. He says, “What?!”

Lorna says, “I’ve come to realize” – that is, I now  understand – “that this is more than a job. It’s a vocation.” A “vocation” (vocatio n) is something that you feel you are called to do as your life’s work. The word “voc ation” comes from the Latin term meaning “to call” – “vocare.” Your “calling,” then, is what you feel that God or destiny has given you as your life’s work, the t hing that you believe you should be doing on this earth.

We sometimes use the word “vocation” to refer to th ose who go into the Christian priesthood or ministry. If you are going to become a minister or a reverend or a priest, we might say that is your “vocation.” But “ vocation” can also be used to describe anything – any career, job, or work that y ou feel is something you are meant to do or destined to do or simply called to d o by some greater power than yourself.

Lorna believes her job is a vocation. She says, “I’ m doing valuable work that I’m well suited for.” “To be well suited” (suited) mean s to be appropriate for something, to be well matched. Some people are well  suited to be athletes. They are born with bodies that are good for certain kind s of athletic activities. A thing may be well suited to a certain use. A hammer is we ll suited for putting nails into the wall. In fact, it is designed to do that. So, L orna feels she is somehow designed to do the work she is doing. She’s well su ited for it.

Deangelo still can’t believe that Lorna is saying w hat she is saying. That’s why he makes a joke in the next sentence. He asks Lorna, “ Are you on something?” The expression “to be on something” means to be under t he influence of drugs,

especially illegal drugs. Lorna is not on drugs. Sh e’s not on something. She’s not taking drugs. In fact, she says she’s just “high on  life.”

The expression “to be high on life” means that you are just happy about your situation. The word “high” (high) usually means to be under the influence of illegal drugs such as marijuana. People who smoke m arijuana “get high,” we say – that is, they get intoxicated by this drug in suc h a way that it changes their mood, the way they feel and think. Lorna is high on  life, however, not on any drug.

She says she has a “newfound sense of purpose.” Som ething that is “newfound” (newfound) is something recently found or discovere d, or perhaps just realized. I have a newfound respect for mothers. In talking to my own mother last weekend, I realized how much work it was to raise 11 childre n as she did. So, I now realize something I didn’t realize before, or I discovered something new. I have a “newfound sense of respect.” Lorna has a “newfound sense of purpose.” “Sense of purpose” is a reason for doing a particular thin g, or perhaps a reason for living.

Lorna has a “sense of purpose” about her life. She now realizes why she is here on this earth, perhaps. She says, “I realize that I ’m doing this job because I have a calling and this is what I’m meant to do.” A “cal ling” is the same as a “vocation.” Remember, we said that “vocation” actually comes fr om the Latin word meaning “calling.” That is, someone is calling you, someone  is addressing you and saying “Do this.” Usually that someone is identified as Go d, in the traditional sense of a “calling” or “vocation.”

Deangelo says, “I’m serious.” He still can’t believ e that Lorna is saying what she is saying. He says, “Are you coming down with somet hing?” The expression “to come down with something” means to begin to feel si ck, often with some common illness such as a cold or a flu. Someone may  say, “I feel like I’m coming down with something.” He means, “I feel as though I ’m getting sick.” Deangelo really thinks that Lorna is sick because she’s sayi ng what he thinks are very strange things about loving her job.

Lorna says, “Of course not,” meaning no, I am not c oming down with something. “Yesterday,” she continues, “it occurred to me the legacy I’ll be leaving behind after my life’s work is done.” Lorna says yesterday  she realized the “legacy” she’ll be leaving behind. A “legacy” (legacy) is something  that you do in life that will be remembered after you are dead, or something valuabl e that you have done that will continue to be valuable after you die.

A “legacy” is something you “leave behind” – that i s, you leave for others to enjoy even after you are dead. Lorna believes she will be  leaving a legacy after her “life’s work is done.” Your “life’s work” is everyt hing you do or the most important things you do in your life. Perhaps someday my lega cy will be ESL Podcast. Who knows?

Deangelo, once again, is still puzzled, still confu sed by Lorna and what she is saying. He says, “Life’s work?” He’s asking what sh e means by this phrase “life’s work” – what specifically is she talking about. Lor na says, “Yes, I’ll be remembered in posterity as someone who made a diffe rence.” “Posterity” (posterity) refers to people born after you, many y ears, perhaps, after you. We might also use the expression “future generations” to describe “posterity.”

Lorna believes she is going to be remembered by peo ple in the future as someone who made a difference – that is, who did so mething important or significant that changed the world somehow. Deangel o says, “You do remember what you do for a living, right?” The expression “d o for a living” means what you do to earn money – your job or your work. Lorna say s she does remember what she does for a living.

She says, “I provide salve for people who need it.”  The word “salve” (salve) refers to a cream or a lotion, a thick liquid that protects your skin or heals your skin. It’s something you put on your body when you damage your skin. The word is not very common. It’s something that is a little  poetic here. Lorna doesn’t actually put lotion on someone’s skin. She believes  psychologically or emotionally, she is helping other people.

She says, once again continuing in this poetic way,  “I give succor to those in need.” “Succor” (succor) means help or assistance o r support for another person. It’s not a very common word in conversational Engli sh; neither is “salve.” But Lorna is being a bit poetic here.

Deangelo then reminds Lorna what her actual job is.  He says, “You serve drinks in a bar.” That is, she gives people alcoholic drin ks in a bar, which doesn’t sound like the kind of job that will make a big differenc e in people’s lives, though of course any job, if done well, could make a differen ce, so we shouldn’t be too skeptical of Lorna’s claims, though Deangelo certai nly is.

Lorna in fact reminds him of an important part of h er job. She says, “I provide a shoulder to cry on.” A “shoulder to cry (cry) on” r efers to a person who is willing to listen to your problems, especially if things are going badly for you, and you perhaps feel like crying. “A shoulder to cry on” is  a person who will listen to you,

especially when you are going through difficult tim es. Lorna says she is “a calm voice in a crazy world.”

Deangelo still isn’t convinced. He says, “Talk abou t delusions of grandeur!” The phrase “talk about” is used to emphasize that anoth er person’s comments are crazy or perhaps extreme or extraordinary. It’s oft en used when you are criticizing another person, or it might be used to give an example of something, a perfect example of something. Let’s say I go to a m ovie and it isn’t very good. I may tell my friend, “Talk about a horrible movie. T hat movie I saw last night was awful.”

Deangelo says, “Talk about delusions of grandeur!” Here he’s criticizing Lorna for what she is saying about how important her job is. The expression “delusions (delusions) of grandeur (grandeur)” refers to a bel ief that you are more important or more significant than you actually are. If you t hink you are the most important thing in the world, you probably have delusions of grandeur.

A “delusion” is a belief that is false – something that perhaps a crazy person might think of. Someone who thinks that he is Napol eon Bonaparte is having a delusion. He thinks something is true that isn’t tr ue. “Delusions of grandeur” refer to someone who thinks that he is great or wonderful  or perhaps famous, when he isn’t any of those things. Deangelo thinks Lorna ha s delusions of grandeur by thinking that her job is so important.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lorna: It’s great to be alive, isn’t it?

Deangelo: What are you so happy about?

Lorna: I’m just happy to come to work.

Deangelo: What?!

Lorna: I’ve come to realize that this is more than a job. It’s a vocation. I’m doing valuable work that I’m well suited for.

Deangelo: Are you on something?

 Lorna: I’m high on life and my newfound sense of pu rpose. I realize that I’m doing this job because I have a calling and this is  what I’m meant to do.

Deangelo: I’m serious. Are you coming down with som ething?

Lorna: Of course not. Yesterday, it occurred to me the legacy I’ll be leaving behind after my life’s work is done.

Deangelo: Life’s work?

Lorna: Yes, I’ll be remembered in posterity as some one who made a difference.

Deangelo: You do remember what you do for a living,  right?

Lorna: I provide salve to people who need it. I giv e succor to those in need.

Deangelo: You serve drinks in a bar.

Lorna: I provide a shoulder to cry on, a calm voice  in a crazy world.

Deangelo: Talk about delusions of grandeur!

This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Aaliy ah about getting old. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier: What crazy new creams are you trying this w eek?

Aaliyah: I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging p roducts that are scientifically proven.

Xavier: Yeah, like that cream that promised to rest ore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. When are you going to realize be auty products are sold using false claims and promises?

Aaliyah: What about you? You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad. Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?

Xavier: That’s based on science. The goal is longev ity.

Aaliyah: And this expensive new computer program?

Xavier: It’s to ward off dementia and Alzheimer’s. I’m keeping my mind active.

Aaliyah: So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging.

Xavier: I guess that’s true, but I’m going to outli ve you.

Aaliyah: Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I’m going to look marvelous!

[end of dialogue]

Xavier says to Aaliyah, “What crazy new creams are you trying this week?” “Cream” (cream) is another word for “lotion” (lotio n). “Cream” or “lotion” is a very thick liquid that you put on your skin, either as m edicine because you have some problem with your skin, or to make your skin look m ore beautiful. Xavier is asking Aaliyah “what crazy new creams” she’s trying this w eek. The word “crazy” here probably just means unusual or strange or different .

Aaliyah responds, “I’ll have you know I only use an ti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” The phrase “I’ll have you k now” is used to present information to another person when you think that o ther person doubts you, or perhaps is attacking you, and you want the other pe rson to know the truth. You want to tell the other person that he is wrong to a ttack you.

Aaliyah believes that Xavier is criticizing her. Th at’s because he uses that word “crazy” new creams. Aaliyah says, “I’ll have you kn ow I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” “Anti-agi ng” refers to efforts to slow down or prevent the effects of getting older. Some compa nies sell certain creams or lotions that people can put on their skin that are supposed to prevent your skin from looking old, from looking as though you are ge tting old.

“Anti-aging” has become a popular commercial idea i n the U.S. as people are getting older, especially people my age who have mo ney to buy things that will, they think, prevent them from looking as old as the y really are. I don’t buy these products myself, but other people do and Aaliyah is  one of them. She only buys products that are “scientifically proven” – that is , for which there is some scientific research or scientific studies that show that this particular thing will actually help you.

Xavier doesn’t believe Aaliyah. He says, “Yeah, lik e that cream that promised to restore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. ” “To restore” (restore) is to return something to the way it was before, to retur n something to its previous condition. Xavier refers to a cream that Aaliyah bo ught that was supposed to restore her “youthful appearance.” “Youthful” (yout hful) refers to looking or feeling younger than you actually are.

Xavier says, “When are you going to realize beauty products are sold under false claims and promises.” Something that is “false” (fa lse) is something that is not true, a lie. A “claim” (claim) is when someone make s a statement about

something, when someone says something is true abou t a certain product or thing or person. A “false claim,” then, is the same  thing as a lie, a “false statement” – an untrue statement about something. X avier is saying that beauty products are sold using false claims, meaning the c ompanies say things that aren’t true.

Aaliyah says to Xavier, “What about you?” meaning y ou are doing some of the same things that you are telling me not to do. She continues, “You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad.” The expression “to jump on the bandwagon” (bandwagon) means to begin doing something that is popular among a lot of other people or to start doing something just becau se a lot of other people are doing it. A “fad” (fad) is something that becomes p opular very quickly, but lasts only a short period of time.

A common example of this would be certain popular d ances. Everyone starts doing this dance, and then six months later, nobody  is doing it. Here in the U.S. there are always dance fads. The “Macarena” from the 1990s would be an example of a “dance fad” – where everyone was danci ng it, and then two or three months later, no one was dancing it – or at least h ere in the U.S. So there are “dance fads.” There are “clothing fads.” There are all sorts of “fads” – things that become popular very quickly, but are only popular f or a short period of time.

Aaliyah says, “Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-call ed superfoods?” Aaliyah is criticizing Xavier for “jumping on the bandwagon” of a health fad. This health fad refers to eating “so-called superfoods.” A “superfo od” (superfood) is a food that is supposed to be very good for you, very healthy. You  may read in the paper about how blueberries are a “superfood.” They are suppose d to do all sorts of wonderful things for you if you eat them. Aaliyah c alls them not “superfoods” but “so-called super foods.”

The phrase “so-called” (called) is used to refer to  something when you don’t really approve of or like that name or term, or you  think it is somehow inappropriate or even wrong. “His so-called friend hit him on the head.” The term “so-called” is used there because your friend doesn ’t normally hit you on the head, so you would be sort of odd describing that p erson as a real friend. So you would say “his so-called friend.” Perhaps he though t that person was his friend. Aaliyah is referring to these foods as “so-called s uperfoods,” meaning she doesn’t really believe they are superfoods.

Xavier disagrees. He says, “That’s based on science . The goal is longevity.” “Longevity” (longevity) refers to the ability to li ve for a long time. So we find out that Xavier has been eating things so he can live f or a long time, and Aaliyah has

been putting things on her skin so it will look lik e she is not old. Remember, this episode is all about fighting the effects and signs  of aging – the things that will happen because you get old and indications that you  are getting old.

Aaliyah says to Xavier, “And this expensive new com puter program?” She’s asking about some new piece of software that Xavier  bought. Xavier says that the computer program is “to ward off dementia and A lzheimer’s.” “To ward (ward) off” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o prevent something so that it doesn’t cause damage, or to stop something from having negative effects on you.

The computer program is supposed to “ward off demen tia” (dementia). “Dementia” is when people have difficulty rememberi ng things. They may even have changes in their personality. These are condit ions that are sometimes associated with people getting very old, although n ot everyone who gets old has dementia. It’s when your mind begins to lose its me mory and perhaps change your behavior. “Alzheimer’s” is a disease that caus es a person’s brain to weaken over time. It also makes it more difficult to remem ber people, to remember facts, even to recognize people in your life.

Xavier thinks that this computer program will help “ward off” the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s. He says, “I’m keeping my mind active.” “Active” (active) has a couple of different meanings. Here, it refers to someone actually doing something either with his body or with his mi nd. Xavier believes that if he keeps his mind active, if he keeps thinking about t hings and analyzing things, doing things with his brain, he will somehow be abl e to ward off the effects of old age.

Aaliyah then says, “So we’re both trying to fight t he effects of aging” – that is, we’re trying to stop the bad things that might happ en to us as we get older, both to our bodies and to our minds. Xavier says, “I gue ss that’s true, but I’m going to outlive you.” “To outlive” (outlive) someone is to live longer than another person. Women typically outlive men of the same age or who were born at the same time. We’re not sure if Xavier and Aaliyah are marr ied to each other, but from the way they talk to each other, it certainly sounds li ke it.

Aaliyah says, “Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I ’m going to look marvelous.” The phrase “to kick (kick) the bucket (bucket)” mea ns to die. It’s an informal expression meaning to die. If someone “kicks the bu cket,” someone has died. It’s sort of a funny phrase. You wouldn’t want to use it  to describe the death of someone close to you.

Aaliyah’s kind of making a joke. She’s saying that before she dies, before she kicks the bucket, she’s going to look “marvelous” ( marvelous). “Marvelous” means wonderful, very good. Aaliyah says she may di e before Xavier, but she’s going to look wonderful when she does, because of c ourse, she’s using all of this anti-aging cream on her skin.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier: What crazy new creams are you trying this w eek?

Aaliyah: I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging p roducts that are scientifically proven.

Xavier: Yeah, like that cream that promised to rest ore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. When are you going to realize be auty products are sold using false claims and promises?

Aaliyah: What about you? You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad. Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?

Xavier: That’s based on science. The goal is longev ity.

Aaliyah: And this expensive new computer program?

Aaliyah: So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging.

# Describing Relative Location

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,218 – Describing Relative Location.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,218. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This dialogue is between Penelope and Outis about d escribing relative location – where things are. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Penelope: Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.

Outis: It’s called Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of the country.

Penelope: Where is it exactly?

Outis: I can’t give you the coordinates, if that’s what you’re after.

Penelope: Of course not. I’m just trying to pinpoin t where it is. Is it near Wichita, Kansas?

Outis: It’s nowhere near Wichita. It’s in the heart  of a remote part of the country.

Penelope: Where is it relative to, this town?

Outis: I can’t give you any reference points or tel l you the distance. I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders  Nebraska.

Penelope: Why are you being so cryptic?

Outis: I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.

Penelope: I thought I’d come for an extended stay t o help you get settled.

Outis: You’ve just answered your own question.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Penelope saying to Outis, “Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.” Outis, apparently, is moving to a new city, a new town. Normally we consider a “town” smaller than a city, but we will sometimes use the two words interchangeably – that is, one for the ot her. Outis says the town is called “Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of  the country.”

The expression “smack (smack) dab” means exactly or  precisely in a certain place, in a certain spot. “Smack dab” is almost alw ays used for a location, to say something is exactly in this place. In fact, normal ly you will hear it together with the expression “in the middle of” – “It’s smack dab  in the middle of the city,” or “It’s smack dab in the middle of a bunch of apartme nt buildings.”

Penelope says, “Where is it exactly?” She wants to know where this town Outis is moving to is. Outis says, “I can’t give you the coo rdinates, if that’s what you’re after.” “Coordinates” (coordinates) refers to the l ongitude and latitude of a certain place. Of course, almost no one knows the coordinat es exactly of where they are. Los Angeles’s coordinates are approximately 34 .0500 degrees north and 118.2500 degrees west, approximately. Outis thinks that Penelope is asking for the coordinates, but of course, she isn’t.

He says, “I can’t give you the coordinates, if that ’s what you’re after.” The use of the word “after” here is a little different than the normal meaning of that word. It doesn’t mean something that comes in a place later than another thing. Instead, it means “looking for” or “trying to get.” If someo ne asks you, “What are you after?” the person is asking what you want, what yo u are trying to get – “What are you looking for?” That’s very different than the more common use of the word “after” such as in the expression “comes after” – “ two comes after one,” “three comes after two,” and so forth.

Penelope says she’s not looking for the coordinates , of course. She says, “I’m just trying to pinpoint where it is.” “To pinpoint”  (pinpoint) means to identify the exact location of something. It could also mean to get the exact meaning of something or to get a lot of detail, a lot of infor mation about a topic. Here we’re using it in the more common sense of location – whe re exactly is it? Penelope’s “trying to pinpoint where it is.”

“Is it near Wichita, Kansas?” Kansas is in the midd le part of the United States – the central part of the United States. Outis, howev er, says no. “It’s nowhere near Wichita.” The expression “nowhere near” means very far from, not close at all. He says, “It’s in the heart of a remote part of the  country.” If something is “in the heart (heart) of” something, it’s in the middle of or center of something. It’s completely surrounded by something.

If you say, “My house is in the heart of the Mojave  Desert,” you mean that it is in the center or middle part of the desert. If you say , “I want to go to New York City and stay in the heart of Manhattan,” you’re saying you want to go and stay right in the middle part of New York City or right where most of the action is in New York City, which is in the borough of Manhattan – t he island which is part of New York City.

The word “heart” normally refers to an organ in you r body – the part of your body that pumps or moves blood through the rest of the b ody. But here it means more the center, or most important part. Outis says that  the town he’s moving to is “in the heart of a remote part of the country.” Somethi ng that is “remote” (remote) is far away from cities and towns and where most peopl e live.

Penelope says, “Where is it relative to, this town? ” The expression “relative to” means in comparison to or in relation to. Outis say s, “I can’t give you any reference points or tell you the distance.” It does n’t sound like Outis knows where he’s going. He says he can’t give Penelope “any ref erence points.” “Reference points” would be something that allows you to deter mine facts about another thing. We might also use the expression “a basis for comparison.”

So, for example, I often describe where a state is in the United States by trying to give you some reference points in terms of directio n – “It’s in the northeast part of the U.S.,” “It’s in the center part of the U.S.,” o r I might say, “It’s 180 miles west of Chicago.” Chicago is a reference point – something you know about already that can help you determine the meaning, or in this case  the location, of another place. But Outis says he can’t give Penelope any re ference points or tell her the distance, the number of miles or kilometers, this t own is from another town.

He continues, “I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders Nebraska.” The “outskirts” (outskirts) refe rs to the area surrounding a town or a city. You have the central part of a city , and then you have the areas which we sometimes call “suburbs” that are on the “ outskirts.” Sometimes we use the word “outskirts” to refer to places that are ev en farther away than the suburbs, that are not part of any town or city form ally, but we’re not quite sure what Outis means about it, just that it’s not in the center part of the town.

 He says it’s “on the outskirts of a “medium-sized t own” – that is, not a large town, not a small town, but something in between. He says  it “borders (borders) Nebraska,” which is a state, again, in the center of the country of the United States. “To border” means to be next to something.

Penelope says, “Why are you being so cryptic?” “Cry ptic” (cryptic) means difficult to understand, unclear. We use the word “cryptic” o ften when someone is using a special code – a person is not giving the informati on in a way we can understand. They might even be using special numbers or even a special language. Penelope wants to know why Outis isn’t just telling  her exactly where this place is.

Outis says, “I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.” “To spill the beans” (beans) means to tell someone a se cret, often by accident. If you “spill the beans” to your friend about something, y ou tell your friend a secret, but you do it accidentally. You didn’t mean to do it. O utis wants Penelope not to accidentally tell him why she’s asking where he’s m oving, but to tell him directly. “Why are you asking me?” That’s what Outis wants to  know.

Penelope says, “I thought I’d come for an extended stay to help you get settled.” Penelope explains to Outis that she wants to know w here he is moving so she can go and help him. She wants to come “for an exte nded (extended) stay (stay).” An “extended stay” is a long visit – when you are visiting someone for many days, perhaps even weeks.

Penelope wants to help Outis “get settled.” The phr asal verb “to get settled” (settled) means to get comfortable in a new place, especially after you’ve just moved there. Sometimes it takes a few weeks for you  to get settled when you move into a new apartment or a new house. You have to find out where everything is and make sure all of your things are in the places you want them to be inside of your apartment. Penelope wants to go a nd help Outis get settled by staying with him for a long period of time.

Outis ends the dialogue by saying, “You’ve just ans wered your own question.” Remember Penelope’s question (or at least the last one she asked in the dialogue) of Outis is “Why are you being so cryptic ?” Why are you being so secretive? Why aren’t you telling me where you’re g oing to live? Well, the answer of course is that Outis doesn’t want Penelope to co me and stay with him and help him get settled. I wonder why?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Penelope: Tell me about the new town you’re moving to.

Outis: It’s called Nusquam and it’s smack dab in the middle of the country.

Penelope: Where is it exactly?

Outis: I can’t give you the coordinates, if that’s what you’re after.

Penelope: Of course not. I’m just trying to pinpoin t where it is. Is it near Wichita, Kansas?

Outis: It’s nowhere near Wichita. It’s in the heart  of a remote part of the country.

Penelope: Where is it relative to, this town?

Outis: I can’t give you any reference points or tel l you the distance. I’ll just say it’s on the outskirts of a medium-sized town and borders  Nebraska.

Penelope: Why are you being so cryptic?

Outis: I’ll tell you that when you spill the beans on why you’re asking.

Penelope: I thought I’d come for an extended stay t o help you get settled.

Outis: You’ve just answered your own question.

This episode is a dialogue between Lucinda and Thom as about expressing disapproval – when you don’t like something. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucinda: Maggie and Gerry are moving in together. T hey want to start a family.

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not marrie d and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them!

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they lov e each other and need our support, not our condemnation.

Thomas: If I were their parents, I’d give them an e arful. Someone should take them to task for making such irresponsible decision s.

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sendin g them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.

Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our n ames.

Thomas: You did what?! How will they know I disappr ove of what they’re doing when you go behind my back and do that?

 Lucinda: I think your reproach will come through lo ud and clear.

[end of dialogue]

Lucinda begins the dialogue by saying to Thomas, “M aggie and Gerry are moving in together. They want to start a family.” M aggie and her boyfriend Gerry are going to move in together – that means they’re going to live in the same place, the same house, the same apartment. They wan t to start a family.

Thomas says he doesn’t approve of that. “To approve ” (approve) is to agree that something is correct or, really, that something is good or acceptable – to accept what someone is doing. If I “approve of your decisi on,” I agree with your decision, or I say your decision is okay. “Approve” can mean both to say something is good or acceptable, as well as to give permission f or someone to do something. Your boss approves your plan for a new project. Her e the verb “to approve” means that you agree with it, that you agree it is correct.

Thomas doesn’t think the fact that Maggie and Gerry  are moving in together is a good thing. He points out that “they’re not married  and it’s a disgrace.” A “disgrace” (disgrace) is something that you should not be proud of, something that is considered what we would call “shameful” or  “dishonorable” – something that is perhaps immoral or unethical to do.

Thomas says, “Shame on them.” This expression “sham e (shame) on” someone is used to show how very much you disapprove of som ething – how you do not approve of what another person is doing and in fact  think that the person doing what you don’t agree with should be embarrassed by his or her actions. You think this person should feel bad about what he or she is doing.

Lucinda says, “I understand your objections.” An “o bjection” (objection) is when you say that you disagree with something. It’s a st atement to show that you think someone is wrong – usually it’s a reason why you th ink someone is wrong, although it could just be a statement showing that you oppose or disagree with another person. Someone may say, “I have objections  to this,” meaning I have reasons why I think this is wrong. Lucinda says, ho wever, that “they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation.”

“Condemnation” (condemnation) is when you disagree with another person and criticize them for their actions, especially when y ou think their actions are immoral or unethical, or simply wrong and harmful e ither to themselves or to others. Lucinda thinks that Maggie and Gerry need L ucinda and Thomas’s

support. She’s saying that Lucinda and Thomas shoul d help Maggie and Gerry, not condemn them, not criticize them, though I’m no t exactly sure why. I guess it’s because they love each other.

Thomas says, “If I were their parents, I’d give the m an earful.” “To give someone an earful,” (earful) means to tell someone that you  are very angry with that person, to perhaps yell at someone, to tell someone  why you think he or she is wrong, but to do so in an angry way. Thomas is sayi ng that if he were Maggie and or Gerry’s parents, he’d “give them an earful.”  He’d yell at them. He’d tell them in an angry way why they were wrong.

He says, “Someone should take them to task for maki ng such irresponsible decisions.” “To take someone to task” (task) means to criticize someone for something he has done wrong or to hold someone resp onsible for his mistakes. To say, “Well, you did this wrong, and therefore yo u have to take responsibility for being wrong.” “To take someone to task” is to t ell the person why he or she is wrong.

Thomas thinks this decision to move in together wit hout being married and to start a family is “irresponsible” (irresponsible). “To be irresponsible” is to be not responsible – that is, to not behave in a way that is necessary according to some rules or simply is a good idea. “To be irresponsibl e” means not to do what you are supposed to do.

Lucinda says, however, that “they know what they’re  doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.” To say something is “ not your place” to do something means it’s not your responsibility. It’s not for yo u to do. It’s not your duty. It’s not your role. Lucinda says it’s not Thomas and Lucinda ’s place to criticize Maggie and Gerry’s decision. “To criticize” means to show why someone is wrong, to show why someone has problems with something.

Thomas says, “But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sending them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.” A “housewarming gift” is a present you give to someone who has moved into a new home or apartment. It’s sort of a way of congratulating someone, perhaps, of giving someone something he wi ll need in his new place. Lucinda says, “Too late,” meaning it’s too late not  to send them a housewarming gift because Lucinda just sent one “and signed both  our names,” meaning she said the gift was from both Thomas and Lucinda.

Thomas is not happy about this. He says, “You did w hat?! How will they know I disapprove of what they’re doing when you go behind  my back and do that?” “To disapprove,” of course, is the opposite of “to appr ove.” “To go behind someone’s

back” is to do something secretly without another p erson knowing. In this case, Lucinda went behind Thomas’s back. She didn’t tell Thomas what she was doing.

We often use this expression when it affects the pe rson you didn’t tell. So here, Lucinda sent a gift and signed both her and Thomas’ s name. She did this without telling Thomas. She “did it behind his back.” Thoma s wonders how Maggie and Gerry will know that he disapproves of what they ha ve done after she sent this gift with his signature on it.

Lucinda says, “I think your reproach will come thro ugh loud and clear.” A “reproach” (reproach) is a statement of disapproval , criticism, and disappointment in another person. It’s a somewhat formal word desc ribing when someone criticizes you, disapproves of what you did, often because of some ethical or moral failing on your part, meaning the person beli eves you did something wrong morally or ethically, not just because you broke a rule.

Lucinda thinks that Thomas’s reproach “will come th rough loud and clear.” The phrase “to come through loud and clear” means to be  easily understood by others. In this case, Lucinda thinks that Maggie an d Gerry will know that he disapproves of their actions despite the fact that Lucinda sent them a gift with Thomas’s signature on the card.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lucinda: Maggie and Gerry are moving in together. T hey want to start a family.

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not marrie d and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them!

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they lov e each other and need our support, not our condemnation.

Thomas: If I were their parents, I’d give them an e arful. Someone should take them to task for making such irresponsible decision s.

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sendin g them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.

 Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our n ames.

Thomas: You did what?! How will they know I disappr ove of what they’re doing when you go behind my back and do that?

Lucinda: I think your reproach will come through lo ud and clear.

# Ramping Up Production

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,220 – Ramping Up Production.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,220. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Valerie and Kare em about increasing production – that is, beginning to make more of som ething in your business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kareem: Have you seen the latest sales figures? We need to ramp up production right now.

Valerie: We don’t know if that increase is simply a  blip or a trend.

Kareem: Those sales figures are significantly above  projected levels. Our product is in demand and we need to meet that demand with a  larger production run.

Valerie: But that would mean a big increase in capi tal outlay.

Kareem: We have to spend money to make money. We do n’t want to be caught short if sales continue like this.

Valerie: But if they don’t, we’d be saddled with a huge surplus in inventory.

Kareem: When we rolled out this new product, we hop ed it would catch on and it has. Are we going to sit on our hands and do nothin g?

Valerie: I guess you’re right. Should we increase p roduction by 10 percent?

Kareem: Ten percent? We’re doubling production.

Valerie: Doubling production?! Are you crazy?

Kareem: Crazy like a fox.

[end of dialogue]

Kareem begins by asking Valerie, “Have you seen the  latest sales figures?” The word “latest” here means most recent – the newest o nes. “Sales” (sales) refers to the things that you sell. “Figures” (figures) refer s to numbers. So, “sales figures” would be numbers that reflect how much you’ve sold.  Have you sold a million dollars? Have you sold a thousand dollars? Those wo uld be examples of sales figures.

Kareem says, “We need to ramp up production right n ow.” “To ramp (ramp) up” means to increase. “Production” is making things. S o, “to ramp up production” means to increase the number of things you are maki ng. Normally the word “production” is used when we’re talking about physi cal things. Cars and chairs and cups – those are things that you could ramp up production on. Kareem is talking about ramping up production on whatever it is that the company Kareem and Valerie work for makes. We’re not sure what pro duct, what thing the company makes at this point.

Valerie says, “We don’t know if that increase is si mply a blip or a trend.” Kareem is looking at how much the company has sold of the product and believes they need to make more, probably because they have start ed to sell more. Valerie, however, says, “We don’t know if that increase” – t he increase in sales – “is simply,” or just, “a blip” (blip).

A “blip” is an increase in something, but it doesn’ t last very long. We might say it’s a “short-lived change” from the expected level  of something. If you have a “blip” in your sales figures, your sales went up for a short time, but it went back down again later. A “trend” (trend) is the directio n that something is moving. It could either be getting better or getting worse ove r time. It’s the direction of change in something. Valerie is saying that it isn’ t clear if the increase in sales is really a trend, if it is actually going to continue  increasing.

Kareem says, “Those sales figures are significantly  above projected levels.” “Significantly” here means a lot – a lot above proj ected levels. Something that is “projected” (projected) is something that is predic ted – what you think will happen in the future. The “level” (level) of something is the amount of something, in this case. So the “projected level” is what you think so mething is going to be in the

future – how much you will have of a certain thing – in this case, sales – in the future.

Kareem says, “Our product is in demand.” If somethi ng is “in demand,” it is desired. It is wanted. It is something people want to get. You might read in the newspaper that housing is “in demand.” That means t hat lots of people are looking for places to live, perhaps because more pe ople have moved into an area. Kareem is talking about the product that thei r company makes being “in demand,” meaning lots of people want to buy it. He says, “We need to meet that demand” – that is, we need to satisfy that demand, we need to give people what they want – “with a larger production run.”

A “production run” is when you make a certain amoun t of things all at once or during a short amount of time. Valerie says, “That would mean a big increase in capital outlay.” “Outlay” (outlay) is the money you  spend to make something or do something. “Capital” (capital) refers to money t hat is used to buy new equipment or buildings or whatever it is you need i n your business to make your business successful. “Capital” in business English usually refers to the things you have in order to make money. You use them to make o ther things.

So a computer, for example, is an example of a capi tal expense or a “capital outlay.” You don’t sell the computer to your custom ers or clients; you use the computer to make something. Well, “capital outlay” in this case would be anything the company would have to spend money on i n order to ramp up production. That might include new machines, for ex ample. Kareem says, “We have to spend money to make money.” This is an old expression. If you want to make a lot of money, you may have to spend some money first in order to get money later.

“We don’t want to be caught short if sales continue  like this,” Kareem says. “To be caught short” means not to have enough of someth ing, especially when you’re talking about money. If you go to a restaurant and you order a big meal, and then you look in your wallet and see you don’t have any money or credit cards, you are “caught short.” This is a good time to get up a nd go to the bathroom and slip out, or escape through the back door of the restaur ant. I’m just kidding. You should never do that.

Valerie disagrees. She says that if the company doe sn’t continue selling its product the way they are now, that the company woul d be “saddled with a huge surplus in inventory.” A couple of important expres sions here. Let’s start with “to be saddled (saddled) with” something. “To be saddle d with” something is the same as “to be stuck (stuck) with” something. Both expressions refer to having to

do something or having to keep something that you d on’t really want to do or to keep.

For example, if you go to school and you take out a  lot of loans to pay for going to school for your classes, and then after leaving school you can’t get a job, you are going to be saddled with a lot of debt – money that you have to pay other people. You can’t avoid it because you took out the se loans. You borrowed money from other people to pay your tuition, to pay  for your classes. Valerie is worried that if the company makes a lot of new prod ucts and sales don’t continue, they will have all of these extra product s. They will be “saddled with,” or stuck with, “a huge surplus in inventory.”

“Inventory” (inventory) refers to things that your company makes that you have in your offices or somewhere waiting to be sold. “Inve ntory” refers to products that are being stored, that are being kept somewhere unt il they are sold. A “surplus” (surplus) is more than what you need. It’s extra. A  “huge surplus in inventory,” then, refers to lots of products that your company has made that you don’t need or that you can’t sell.

Kareem says, “When we were rolled out this new prod uct, we hoped it would catch on and it has.” The phrasal verb “to roll (ro ll) out” means to start selling something or start offering something for people to  buy. The phrasal verb “to catch (catch) on” means to become popular. Kareem s ays that they rolled out their new product and it, in fact, “caught on.” Not ice “caught” is the past tense of “catch.” So the product “caught on.” “Are we going to sit on our hands and do nothing?” Kareem asks. The expression “to sit on your hands” means to take no action, to do nothing. It’s somewhat repetitive for Kareem to say “sit on our hands and do nothing.” “To sit on your hands” is an expression that means to do nothing, t o take no action. Valerie says, “I guess you’re right.” Now she agrees with K areem. “Should we increase production by 10 percent?”

Kareem says, “Ten percent? We’re doubling productio n.” “To double” (double) is to do twice as much of something, to increase the a mount by 100 percent. Valerie thought they should increase production by 10 percent. Kareem says, “No, we should double it.” Valerie can’t believe wh at Kareem is saying. She says, “Are you crazy?” Kareem responds with an old expres sion, “Crazy like a fox” (fox).

The expression “crazy like a fox” refers to someone  who seems to be crazy, who seems to be not acting logically or rationally, but  actually is very smart, very intelligent, who knows what he’s doing, who is doing something (even if you can’t

realize it) that is very intelligent. Is Kareem cra zy like a fox or is he just crazy? I guess Kareem and Valerie will find out soon.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kareem: Have you seen the latest sales figures? We need to ramp up production right now.

Valerie: We don’t know if that increase is simply a  blip or a trend.

Kareem: Those sales figures are significantly above  projected levels. Our product is in demand and we need to meet that demand with a  larger production run.

Valerie: But that would mean a big increase in capi tal outlay.

Kareem: We have to spend money to make money. We do n’t want to be caught short if sales continue like this.

Valerie: But if they don’t, we’d be saddled with a huge surplus in inventory.

Kareem: When we rolled out this new product, we hop ed it would catch on and it has. Are we going to sit on our hands and do nothin g?

Valerie: I guess you’re right. Should we increase p roduction by 10 percent?

Kareem: Ten percent? We’re doubling production.

Valerie: Doubling production?! Are you crazy?

Kareem: Crazy like a fox.

# Buffing Up Home Security

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,221 – Buffing Up Home Security.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,221. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and become a member of ESL Podcast  or take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has additional courses in Business and Daily English that I know you’re going to like.

This episode is a dialogue between Joselyn and Mart in about increasing or improving your security at home – making sure you a re safe in your house. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: Why do you look so upset?

Joselyn: Our neighbor’s house was broken into last night. The burglar stole her laptop and some jewelry. Like us, she doesn’t have a security system.

Martin: Burglar alarms aren’t foolproof. Well, I’m not letting any burglars get close to our house. Let’s go.

Joselyn: Where are we going?

Martin: To the home improvement store. We need to b uff up our security. I want to install motion detectors, floodlights, and secur ity cameras to the outside of the house.

Joselyn: I suppose that’s a good idea.

Martin: I also want to put a timer on our indoor li ghts and a better deadbolt for the front door.

Joselyn: Those will probably help.

Martin: We can find out the cost of metal bars for the windows and a security door.

 Joselyn: Whoa, I think that might be a bit much.

Martin: Nonsense. If we’re going to do something, we’re going to do it right. Barbed wire on top of our fence would probably be n ext . . .

Joselyn: That’s not a good idea . . .

Martin: And last but not least, we’ll need an attac k dog.

Joselyn: An attack dog?! This is sounding more like  a military compound than a home.

Martin: That’s right. When I’m done, Fort Knox will  have nothing on us!

[end of dialogue]

Martin asks Joselyn, “Why do you look so upset?” “U pset” (upset) means angry or concerned or worried. Joselyn says, “Our neighbo r’s house was broken into last night.” The house of Joselyn’s neighbor – the person who lives next to her – was “broken into.” The phrasal verb “to break into”  means to go into someone’s house or a building or a car without permission, us ually to steal something. If the house was “broken into,” the house was entered by s omeone who probably went in to steal something.

In fact, that’s exactly what happened, as we learn in the next sentence. Joselyn says, “The burglar stole her laptop and some jewelr y.” A “burglar” (burglar) is another word for a person who steals things – a “th ief,” we might also call him. This “burglar” stole her neighbor’s laptop computer  and some jewelry. Joselyn says, “Like us, she doesn’t have a security system. ”

Joselyn’s neighbor does not have a “security system ,” which is an electronic system that makes a loud noise or automatically cal ls the police if someone goes into a home or building without permission. Where I  live here in west Los Angeles, lots of houses have security systems. Some times security systems are called “burglar alarms.” An “alarm” (alarm) is a no ise or some sort of signal that tells you that there is a problem or that indicates  that something needs your attention. A “burglar alarm” is another term for a security system.

Martin says, “Burglar alarms aren’t foolproof.” If something is “foolproof” (foolproof), it is very easy to use and cannot fail . The idea is that even a foolish or stupid person can use it correctly. Here it also re fers to something that will

always work, that will always be effective. But Mar tin says burglar alarms are not foolproof. Then he says to Joselyn, “I’m not lettin g,” or allowing, “any burglars get close to our house. Let’s go.”

Joselyn says, “Where are we going?” Martin says, “T o the home improvement store.” A “home improvement store” is a store that sells things for fixing your house or making changes to your house. Martin says,  “We need to buff up our security.” The phrasal verb “to buff (buff) up” mea ns to make stronger or to increase the size or quantity of something. If you’ re going “to buff up” your security, you’re going to make it stronger or incre ase your security.

We also use this word when talking about the human body. If you’re going “to buff up,” you’re going to make yourself stronger. Y ou’re going to have bigger muscles. We might describe a man or a woman who has  big muscles as being “buff.” That’s an adjective. As a verb, “to buff up ” means to increase strength or size. Martin wants to buff up his security.

He says, “I want to install motion detectors, flood  lights, and security cameras to the outside of the house.” These are three ways of increasing your security or how safe you are in a given place. One thing Martin  wants to install, or put in, is a “motion detector.” The word “detector” comes from t he verb “to detect” (detect). “To detect” means to notice or identify. A “motion detector” is an object that can notice or detect when someone is moving in front of  it. A motion detector usually has a light attached to it so when you walk in fron t of it, the light automatically comes on.

“Floodlights” (floodlights) are large lights that p roduce a lot of illumination, a lot of light over a large area. They’re very strong lights . “Security cameras” are cameras that record videos of a certain area. Some buildings, for example, have security cameras. Martin wants to get security came ras for his house. Jocelyn says, “I suppose that’s a good idea,” referring to the idea of buffing up their security.

Martin says, “I also want to put a timer on our ind oor lights and a better deadbolt for the front door.” A “timer” (timer) is a device,  a little machine that automatically turns something on or off at a certain time every d ay. A timer on your indoor lights would automatically turn, say, a lamp or oth er light on inside your house so that people think that there is someone home, there  is someone inside your house, even when you’re not there.

A “deadbolt” (deadbolt) is a lock on your door that  is basically a piece of metal that goes through a hole. You have to use a key to turn the deadbolt to get the

piece of metal to come out of the hole so you can o pen the door. It’s a more secure kind of lock on your door. Joselyn agrees th at these things will probably help in buffing up home security. Martin continues,  however: “We can find out the cost” – we can find out how much the price is – “of  metal bars for the windows and a security door.”

Martin thinks perhaps they should get “metal (metal ) bars (bars).” “Metal bars” are long, heavy or thick pieces of metal that go ov er your windows. In some houses here in Los Angeles, especially in some of t he poorer neighborhoods, you will see metal bars on the windows. This preven ts people from coming into the window. You can’t just break the window and ent er the house because the metal bars will block you. Martin wants metal bars,  or at least he wants to investigate putting metal bars on the windows of th eir house.

He also wants to get a security door. A “security d oor” is a very thick, strong door, often made of metal, but it could just be woo d that is put on the front of a house or a building to protect it. Joselyn now thin ks that Martin is perhaps overreacting – doing too much. She says, “Whoa,” me aning stop or wait, “I think that might be a bit much,” meaning too much. Martin  says, “Nonsense.” He disagrees with Joselyn. That’s what that word “nons ense” means in this case: “I disagree strongly.” “If we’re going to do something , we’re going to do it right,” meaning we’re going to do it correctly.

He then says, “Barbed wire on the top of our fence would probably be next.” “Barbed (barbed) wire” are long, thin pieces of met al that have short, what we would describe as “spiky” bits to them – parts to t hem that will cut you if you touch them. You will sometimes see barbed wire on t he top of fences or walls around some very secure area – a military installat ion or some other area where the business wants to prevent people from getting i nto that area.

“Barbed wire” is a pretty serious thing to put on t op of your fence, and some cities don’t allow barbed wire unless you get special perm ission to put it there. Joselyn doesn’t think this is a good idea. Martin says, “An d last but not least” – meaning this is the last thing I will mention, but it isn’t  the least important – “we’ll need an attack dog.” An “attack dog” would be a dog that ha s been trained to attack people when ordered to do so, You could think of a big dog such as a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher.

Joselyn is now surprised at what Martin is saying. She says, “An attack dog? This is sounding more like a military compound than  a home.” A “military compound” (compound) is an area of land that is own ed by the army or some

other military organization that is protected with a lot of security. Martin says, “That’s right. When I’m done, Fort Knox will have n othing on us.”

“Fort Knox” (Knox) is an army base located in the s tate of Kentucky in the United States, where the United States government traditio nally has stored gold as part of the property of the U.S. government. Fort Knox i s considered one of the most secure places in the U.S., or at least, traditional ly was considered that way. People use that place now as sort of a representati on of a very, very secure place. To say that my house is like Fort Knox means  that my house is as secure or as safe as Fort Knox because it is protected ver y well.

That’s why Martin says when he’s done, Fort Knox wi ll have nothing on them. When you use the expression “to have nothing on” so meone, you mean that it will not be as good as what you have. So if you say , “He has nothing on me,” you mean he is not better than I am. I am better than h e is, or at least I’m as good as he is. I could say, for example, “Well, Brad Pitt i s handsome, but he has nothing on me when it comes to charm, when it comes to pers onality, when it comes to not having any hair.” He has nothing on me. He’s no t better than me in those areas.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: Why do you look so upset?

Joselyn: Our neighbor’s house was broken into last night. The burglar stole her laptop and some jewelry. Like us, she doesn’t have a security system.

Martin: Burglar alarms aren’t foolproof. Well, I’m not letting any burglars get close to our house. Let’s go.

Joselyn: Where are we going?

Martin: To the home improvement store. We need to b uff up our security. I want to install motion detectors, floodlights, and secur ity cameras to the outside of the house.

Joselyn: I suppose that’s a good idea.

Martin: I also want to put a timer on our indoor li ghts and a better deadbolt for the front door.

 Joselyn: Those will probably help.

Martin: We can find out the cost of metal bars for the windows and a security door.

Joselyn: Whoa, I think that might be a bit much.

Martin: Nonsense. If we’re going to do something, we’re going to do it right. Barbed wire on top of our fence would probably be n ext . . .

Joselyn: That’s not a good idea . . .

Martin: And last but not least, we’ll need an attac k dog.

Joselyn: An attack dog?! This is sounding more like  a military compound than a home.

Martin: That’s right. When I’m done, Fort Knox will  have nothing on us!

This episode is a dialogue between Jerry and Helen about liquid – things that make you wet – how you describe how much liquid you  have and how liquid moves. All that coming up in this episode. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerry: Want to help me wash my car?

Helen: I guess so.

Jerry: Good. Squirt a little of this cleaning fluid  into this bucket.

Helen: Okay, done.

Jerry: Then pour a capful of this into the bucket a nd mix. After that, dribble three drops of this special liquid into it and stir until  you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.

Helen: Okay, but I usually just use soap and water.

Jerry: That might be fine for your car, but for my baby, it’s nothing but the best. Stop!

Helen: Why? I was just going to use this hose to sp ray water onto the car to get it wet.

Jerry: You can’t just splash water on the paint. Yo u have to let it flow gently down from the roof of the car in a cascade.

 Helen: You’re kidding, right?

Jerry: Not at all. Splattering water on the paint c ould damage it in the long run. Let the water gush out of the hose and onto the roo f of the car. Let it caress the car like you’re . . .

Helen: You know what? I think this is getting a lit tle weird. I think I’ll leave you and your baby alone.

[end of dialogue]

Jerry begins our dialogue by asking Helen, “Want to  help me wash my car?” Jerry means “Do you want to help me wash my car?” I n informal conversational English, sometimes we will drop the “do you” part a nd simply use the main verb, which in this case is “want.” “Want to help me wash  my car?”

Helen doesn’t seem very excited. She says, “I guess  so.” That expression “I guess (guess) so” has nothing to do with trying to figure out the answer to a problem. Instead, it means yes, but in a way that i sn’t very enthusiastic. You’re not really interested. When someone says, “I guess so,” he means yes, but he isn’t very excited by it or doesn’t agree very stro ngly with what you are saying or asking. Jerry says, “Good,” meaning “I’m glad you want to help me.”

He tells Helen, “Squirt a little of this cleaning f luid into this bucket.” The verb “to squirt” (squirt) means to squeeze or to get liquid out of a bottle, usually through a very small hole or opening. It’s the verb we might use, for example, if we were putting ketchup or mustard onto a hot dog. “Ketchup ” and “mustard” are liquids that are in bottles – often nowadays plastic bottle s – that you can put your hand around and squeeze. You can make it so that the liq uid comes out of the hole at the top of the bottle. The verb there would be “to squirt” the liquid – to get the liquid out of the bottle by squeezing it.

Jerry wants Helen to squirt some cleaning fluid int o a bucket. “Fluid” (fluid) means the same as “liquid” (liquid). Both things re fer to something that, if you put it on your body, would make you wet. Well, it could  have some other consequences as well. A “liquid” is a technical ter m that is not a solid and not a gas. In the physical world we have gases, solids, a nd liquids. Something that is a “fluid” is a liquid.

The word “fluid” here is used as a noun. It can als o be used as an adjective. As an adjective, “fluid” means easily changeable or so mething that is changing.

Here, it’s a noun referring to liquid. Jerry wants Helen to squirt a little cleaning fluid into a “bucket” (bucket). A “bucket” is a rou nd container – round on the sides – that has a flat bottom. There’s no top on a bucke t. Buckets are usually used to carry liquids.

Helen says, “Okay, done,” meaning she has completed  that task. Jerry then says, “Pour a capful of this into the bucket and mi x.” A “cap” (cap) is what goes on top of a bottle to close it, to make sure that t he liquid doesn’t come out of the bottle. A “capful” would be the amount of liquid th at would fit into the cap of the bottle. So you actually pour the liquid – you pour the fluid. You put the fluid into the little cap until the cap is full. That’s how yo u get a “capful” (capful). Notice there’s just one “l” in “capful” even though the wo rd “full” normally has two “l”s.

So Jerry tells Helen “to pour” (pour) the liquid in to the cap until she has a “capful.” “Pour” means to move liquid from one cont ainer to another. After she puts this capful of liquid into the bucket, Helen i s supposed to mix it. “To mix” (mix) means to combine two things together. After s he mixes these liquids together, Jerry asks her to “dribble three drops of  this special liquid into it and stir until you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.”

There are several words there we need to explain. T he first one is “dribble” (dribble). “To dribble” means to cause a few small drops, a few small amounts of a liquid, to fall into a surface – or to fall onto a surface, we would probably say. If you like pancakes (and who doesn’t like pancakes), you might take some syrup, some sweet liquid, and “dribble” it onto your panca kes – put a little bit on there drop by drop, small amount of liquid by small amoun t of liquid.

That’s what Jerry tells Helen to do with some sort of special liquid that he has. Then he tells her to stir all this together. “To st ir” (stir) means to move a spoon or a stick in the liquid to combine or mix the liquid together. Sometimes, if you stir very quickly, you will cause the liquid to form wha t’s called a “foam” (foam). A foam is a liquid that has become or been made into small bubbles that sit on top of the liquid.

When you stir a liquid very quickly, very rapidly, air can enter into the liquid and form what’s called a “bubble.” A “bubble” (bubble) is liquid that has air inside of it. You can think of it that way. A balloon, for exampl e, is a kind of bubble, except instead of being made of liquid, it is made of plas tic. “Foam” is essentially a lot of small or tiny bubbles together on top of liquid.

Helen says, “Okay, but I usually just use soap and water.” She usually just uses soap and water when she washes her own car. Jerry s ays, “That might be fine

for your car” – meaning that’s good enough for your  car – “but,” Jerry continues, “for my baby, it’s nothing but the best.” The word “baby” here refers not to a young child, but to Jerry’s car.

Sometimes people use the word “baby” to describe so mething they own that they really love and they take care of. Some people love  their cars like children, I guess, and that’s the case with Jerry. He says for his baby – for his car – “it’s nothing but the best.” That means he will only use the very best products. He will only treat it in the very best way. He then tells H elen to stop doing what she’s doing. We’re not sure what she’s doing. But we find  out in the next sentence.

Helen says, “Why? I was just going to use this hose  to spray water onto the car to get it wet.” A “hose” (hose) is a long piece of tubing that is used to move water or other liquids from one place to another. If you have a lawn, if you have grass in front of your house or in back of your house, yo u may need to put water on it. You can use a “hose” to get water from your house o nto the lawn. The water will move through the hose, which is basically a plastic  tube.

Helen is using a hose “to spray” (spray) water onto  the car. “To spray” means to push liquid through many small holes, causing the l iquid to go out of the hose in small drops. For example, firefighters – people who  put out fires – use big hoses that spray water onto burning buildings. They spray  the water. The water moves in different directions to put the fire out.

Jerry says, “You can’t just splash water on the pai nt. You have to let it flow gently down from the roof of the car in a cascade.” “To sp lash” (splash) means to cause water to hit against something, usually in a forcef ul way – that is, the water hits the surface hard. Jerry doesn’t want Helen to splas h water onto his car. He wants the water “to flow” (flow) gently. “To flow” means to move liquid across a surface.

Jerry wants the water to come down over the car in a “cascade” (cascade). A cascade is when water or other liquid falls down ra pidly over a surface. You can think of a “waterfall” – when water falls from the top of one surface down quickly to another surface – as being a kind of cascade. In  fact, the word “cascade” sometimes is used to mean the same as “waterfall” i n English. Here it’s used, however, as a verb meaning to have the water act as  though it were a waterfall, flowing quickly, flowing rapidly across the surface  of the car.

Helen says, “You’re kidding, right?” meaning “You’r e joking.” Jerry says, “Not at all,” meaning “No. I’m not joking.” “Splattering wa ter on the paint could damage it in the long run.” “To splatter” (splatter) means to  cause a liquid to hit something.

It’s very similar to the previous verb “to splash.”  The verb “to splatter” is often used with paint as a liquid rather than water.

If you “splatter” paint on a wall, you cause the pa int to go on the wall, but not in any sort of pattern. You are causing the paint to make marks on the wall that perhaps you don’t want. Unless of course you are the artist Jackson Pollock, who was famous for splattering paint on pieces of canva s – things that you use to paint a painting on. He made a lot of money splatte ring paint.

Jerry doesn’t want Helen splattering water on the p aint of his car because he thinks it could hurt the paint. He says, “Let the w ater gush out of the hose and onto the roof of the car.” “To gush” (gush) means t o move liquid very quickly and in large amounts over a surface. He says, “Let the water caress the car.” “To caress” (caress) means usually to touch someone wit h your hand in a slow, gentle, pleasant way that shows that you love that person or you care for that person. You could also caress an object like a car.  And that’s what Jerry wants Helen to do with the water.

Clearly, Helen is not going to continue doing this.  She says, “You know what? I think this is getting a little weird.” She’s tellin g Jerry that she thinks the way he wants to wash his car is strange, is odd. Helen the n says, “I think I’ll leave you and your baby alone.” She saying that Jerry is trea ting his car as if the car were a person almost, and therefore she doesn’t want to be  part of this strange way of washing a car.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jerry: Want to help me wash my car?

Helen: I guess so.

Jerry: Good. Squirt a little of this cleaning fluid  into this bucket.

Helen: Okay, done.

Jerry: Then pour a capful of this into the bucket a nd mix. After that, dribble three drops of this special liquid into it and stir until  you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.

This episode is a dialogue between Morris and Tony about growing up in difficult situations. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Morris: Congratulations on finishing your latest bo ok. What’s it about?

Toni: It’s about a girl whose parents abandoned her  at birth and who ends up living on the streets. She experiences abuse and is  put in juvie.

Morris: Wow, that sounds heavy. Wasn’t your last bo ok about children whose parents served time in prison and who lived in fear  of bullies in their neighborhood?

Toni: Yes, I wrote that after my first book, which was about a brother and sister who lived in an impoverished home, traumatized by e vents beyond their control.

Morris: Do you ever write about happy childhoods?

Toni: I do write about happy childhoods. All of the  children and teenagers in my books are very resilient. They are survivors.

Morris: I was thinking about children who have normal childhoods with two parents living in the suburbs.

Toni: You call that normal? You think they’d be hap py? I bet there’s an underbelly of crime and misery in most seemingly pe rfect families.

 Morris: I’ve no doubt that if that were true, you’d  be the one to write about it.

[end of dialogue]

Morris says to Tony, “Congratulations on finishing your latest book.” We can guess that Tony is a writer, an author. Morris asks  Tony, “What’s it about?” meaning “What is your book about?” What is the topi c of the book? Tony says, “It’s about a girl whose parents abandoned her at b irth and who ends up living on the streets.” “To abandon someone at birth” is to g ive up your baby right after the baby is born. Usually this expression “to abandon s omeone at birth” refers to, typically, a mother who leaves her child perhaps at  the door of a hospital or somewhere else.

There used to be a term for this called a “foundlin g” (foundling). A “foundling” is a baby who has been abandoned by his or her mother an d who is found – hence the word “foundling” – by someone else who takes ca re of the baby. It was even quite common in some cities in Europe to have found ling hospitals. There’s one in London. There’s one in Florence, Italy, and in s everal other cities. Fortunately, nowadays, we don’t have a lot of foundlings, but th at’s what happens in Tony’s book. A girl is abandoned at birth and ends up livi ng on the streets.

The expression “to live on the streets” means to be  without a home, to not be able to live in any one place but to have to perhap s move around every day. A more common term nowadays is simply “homeless.” “To  live on the streets” implies often that you are involved perhaps in acti vities that aren’t very healthy or safe. Tony says the character, the girl in her nove l, “experiences abuse and is put in juvie.” “Abuse” (abuse) is when someone hurt s you, either physically or emotionally, perhaps even sexually.

This girl eventually “is put in juvie” (juvie). “Ju vie” is another word for “juvenile detention.” Juvenile detention is where you go if y ou are under the age of 18 and commit a crime or do something wrong. You will not go to a regular prison or jail. You will instead typically be sent to a special jai l for children and teenagers called “juvenile detention.” “Juvenile” means that you are  young. You are not an adult. In the United States, you are an adult legally when  you are 18 years of age. The girl in Tony’s novel is eventually placed in juveni le detention – in “juvie.”

Morris says, “Wow, that sounds heavy,” meaning that  sounds very serious. “Wasn’t your last book about children whose parents  served time in prison and who lived in fear of bullies in their neighborhood? ” Tony’s previous book was about parents who “served time in prison.” “To serv e (serve) time in prison”

means to spend time in jail, to be a prisoner. “To live in fear” of something means to always be worried or frightened of something. So me people live in fear of death. They are worried about dying all the time, w hich is not a very good way to enjoy your life.

In Tony’s novel, the children (whose parents are in  prison, remember) live “in fear of bullies.” A “bully” (bully) is a person who is m ean to other people, who uses his strength, power, or influence to hurt other people or to make other people scared. Normally the term “bully” is used to describe a chi ld who intimidates or is mean to another child. More recently, the word has begun to  be applied to adults, although the primary use is still one which is refe rring to a child or a teenager who is mean to another child or teenager.

The characters in Tony’s previous novel “lived in f ear of bullies in their neighborhood” – in the area where they grew up. Ton y says, “Yes, I wrote that after my first book, which was about a brother and sister who lived in an impoverished home, traumatized by events beyond the ir control.” What happy novels Tony writes. The first book she wrote was ab out a brother and sister who lived in an “impoverished home.” “Impoverished” (im poverished) means very poor, without a lot of money. They lived in a house , a poor house, and were “traumatized by events beyond their control.”

“To be traumatized” (traumatized) means to be affec ted by something very bad that happens to you, a very bad experience or perha ps even a bad injury to your body. If you are traumatized by events, something h appens in your life that affects you mentally, emotionally, or psychological ly. Events that are “beyond your control” are things that you are not able to i nfluence or stop. There are many things in our life that are beyond our control – th ings that we can’t stop or influence, like how stupid other people are. There’ s not a lot you can do about that, although I’ve tried.

Morris asks Tony, “Do you ever write about happy ch ildhoods?” “Childhood” refers to the time when you are growing up, between  the time you are born and, say, 18 years old. Tony says, “I do write about hap py childhoods. All the children and teenagers in my books are very resilient.” “Res ilient” (resilient) is an adjective meaning to be able to recover quickly fro m a difficult experience or situation. Someone who is “resilient” is someone wh o, even though he goes through difficult times, is able to recover, is abl e to get better.

Tony describes her characters as being “survivors” (survivors). A “survivor” is someone who remains alive – the word comes from the  verb “to survive” – even when he is in difficult situations. A survivor is s omeone who is able to continue

living even when he may die because of the situatio n he is in – and of course, who can forget that wonderful song by Destiny’s Chi ld, “I’m a Survivor.”

“I’m a survivor, I’m gonna make it I will survive, keep on surviving.”

Great stuff, great stuff. Anyway, we’re talking abo ut survivors in Tony’s depressing novels. Morris says, “I was thinking abo ut children who have normal childhoods with two parents living in the suburbs.”  The “suburbs” are the areas outside of the main city, which in the United State s are often where the richer people live. Tony says, “You call that normal?”

She doesn’t think having two parents and living in the suburbs is normal the way Morris does and the rest of us do. Tony says, “You think they’d be happy?” meaning “Are you saying that the children would be happy with two parents living in the suburbs?” Once again, most of the evidence s ays they are, but not Tony. No. Tony says, “I bet there is an underbelly of cri me and misery in most seemingly perfect families.”

An “underbelly” (underbelly) is something that is h idden normally, something you can’t see that usually involves either crime or som ething bad happening. “Misery” (misery) is suffering – extreme unhappiness – when everything is terrible and sad, like watching an American presidential electio n. It’s misery.

The word “seemingly” (seemingly) means apparently –  something appears a certain way, but it isn’t really. That’s why Tony s ays that she thinks there’s an “underbelly of crime and misery in seemingly perfec t families.” The families look perfect, but in fact they’re not. They’re full of m isery, according to Tony.

Morris says, “I’ve no doubt that if that were true,  you’d be the one to write about it.” Morris is saying that if it were in fact true that there is an underbelly of misery in seemingly perfect families, Tony would be the pe rson who would write stories about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Morris: Congratulations on finishing your latest bo ok. What’s it about?

# Setting Timers and Alarms

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 1,224 – Setting Timers and Alarms.   This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 1,224. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast Learning Guides. Our Learning Guides contain complete transcripts of everything we say on these episodes, in addition to a complete glossary – that is, definitions of our keywords – as well as sample sentences using those keywords.   This episode is a dialogue between Laquisha and Yun about getting a reminder when you need to do something by using a timer. Let’s get started.   [start of dialogue]  Laquisha: What’s in the bag?  Yun: Three alarm clocks and a kitchen timer.  Laquisha: What are they for?  Yun: I have a very important interview tomorrow morning and these will help me prepare for it.   Laquisha: How?  Yun: The timer will help me time my responses to common interview questions so I don’t run off at the mouth. See? Instead of the stopwatch function, I use the countdown function so I’ll know when to wrap up.  Laquisha: And the alarm clocks?  Yun: I have a habit of pressing the snooze button after an alarm goes off. I’ve tried different kinds of alarms: ones that buzz, ones that beep, ones that vibrate, and ones that use a ringtone. But I still fall back to sleep.  Laquisha: And what do you plan to do with three alarm clocks?       # Being a Good Samaritan

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,225 – Being a Good Samaritan.

This episode is a dialogue between Ana Maria and Gi o about helping someone who needs help. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ana Maria: Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?

Gio: That’s his own fault. Who told him to meddle i n other people’s business?

Ana Maria: He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow  human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.

Gio: Doing a good deed, was he? Going out on a limb  to help someone in need, eh?

Ana Maria: Exactly. I call him a hero.

Gio: I call him a fool. You don’t put yourself in d anger to help a stranger. That’s just common sense.

Ana Maria: So you would have just walked right by a nd done nothing to help.

Gio: If it meant putting myself in jeopardy. You sh ould always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.

Ana Maria: Great, remind me never to get into a lif eboat with you!

[end of dialogue]

Ana Maria asks Gio, “Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?” The term “Good Samaritan” nowadays refers to a kind person, specifically some one who will stop and help someone whom they don’t know who needs help. The te rm comes from a story from the Christian Bible, specifically from the boo k of St. Luke in the New Testament of the Bible. It’s what is called one of the “parables,” or stories, that Jesus told in the Bible.

A Good Samaritan refers then to someone who helps a nother person who needs help, even someone the person doesn’t know. That’s what happened in this news story that Ana Maria is talking about. Unfortu nately, the person who stopped to help the stranger died. A “stranger” (st ranger) is a person you don’t know, a person who you have never met before. Gio, however, doesn’t feel sorry for the Good Samaritan. He says, “That’s his own fa ult.”

When you say something is someone’s “own (own) faul t (fault),” you mean that the person himself is responsible for his problems.  The word “fault” here refers to “blame.” If I say, “It’s your fault” or “It’s your own fault,” I mean you are the person responsible for the bad thing that happen to you. I f you have a test tomorrow, an examination tomorrow, and you don’t prepare for it and then you do very poorly on that exam, I will say, “Well, it’s your own faul t. You didn’t study. You are the person who is responsible for your poor performance .”

Gio says, “Who told him,” meaning the Good Samarita n, “to meddle in other people’s business?” The verb “to meddle” (meddle) m eans to get involved in something that you should not be involved in or to try to influence other people’s activities or decisions. “To meddle” is usually a v erb we use when we are criticizing another person’s actions, saying the ot her person should not have done this because it was none of his business.

Ana Maria says, “He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.” T he word “fellow” (fellow) as an adjective refers to someone who is in the same cate gory or group as you are or as another person about whom you’re speaking. For e xample, I can talk about my “fellow Californians.” These are other people wh o are also, like I am, from California or who live in California now. I could t alk about “the Queen of England and her fellow Britons” – that is, people who, like  the Queen of England, are also British, are also considered part of that group.

All of us are human beings, except you cats out the re. Therefore, “to stop and help a fellow human being” is to stop and help some one who is part of the same group as you are. The Good Samaritan in our story s topped to help a fellow human being who “was in distress.” “To be in distre ss” (distress) is to be in a crisis, to need help, to be perhaps very unhappy or  worried because of some situation you are in. The Good Samaritan was “selfl ess” (selfless). “To be selfless” means not to think about your own needs –  to help others even when it may hurt you.

Gio is not convinced. He says, “Doing a good deed, was he?” This is a form of what we call a “tag question.” It’s often used in t his form, and pronounced this way, when someone doesn’t really believe what the o ther person is saying. And that’s the case with Gio. He doesn’t really think t his person was doing a good deed. What’s a “good deed” (deed)? It’s an action y ou do for another person that will help that person even though you don’t get any thing for it yourself.

Gio says, “Going out on a limb to help someone in n eed, eh?” Once again, he’s asking this as a question, but in a way he’s just e xpressing his doubt. The phrase “to go out on a limb” (limb) – notice the “b” is no t pronounced – means to take a risk, to do something that may cause you harm. This  person was “going out on a limb,” doing something risky, in order to help a pe rson “in need” – that is, someone who needed help.

Ana Maria says, “Exactly,” meaning yes, that is in fact what he was doing, even though Gio doesn’t believe it. She says, “I call hi m a hero” (hero). A “hero” is someone who does something brave, something that re quires courage, and therefore is someone whom you would admire and resp ect. Gio says, “I call him a fool” (fool). A “fool” is someone who isn’t very smart or who does something without thinking rationally or clearly.

Gio continues, “You don’t put yourself in danger to  help a stranger.” “To put yourself in danger” (danger) is to do something tha t may cause you harm, that may hurt you. If you are driving down a freeway, a highway, and you are drunk – you’ve had too much to drink – you’re putting yourself in danger. You may hurt yourself. In fact, you’re putting other people in d anger, too. Don’t do that.

Gio says that you should not put yourself in danger  to help a stranger. “That’s just common sense,” Gio says. “Common sense” refers  to the ordinary or regular ability of people to make good decisions. Something  that everyone knows is a good idea is “common sense.” Ana Maria then says, “ So you would have just walked right by and done nothing to help?”

Gio says, “If it meant putting myself in jeopardy,”  meaning yes, he would have just walked right by and done nothing to help if he lping the person would have put him in jeopardy. “To be put in jeopardy” (jeopa rdy) is to put yourself in danger. Gio is saying here that if he thought he wa s going to be in jeopardy, in danger, he would not have helped the man – the stra nger who needed help. We’re not sure if it’s a man or a woman. Gio says, “You should always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.”

Gio believes you should always look out for yoursel f. “To look out for yourself” means to protect yourself first and not worry about  anyone else around you. Ana Maria says, “Great, remind me never to get into a l ifeboat with you.” A “lifeboat” (lifeboat) is a small boat carried on a larger boat , or ship, that is used if the larger boat is having problems and you need to leave it. I f you are on a large boat or ship, you will usually have lifeboats that will be used to get off of that boat if the larger boat or ship is sinking or has some sort of serious problem.

Ana Maria is making a joke here. She says, “Remind me never to get into a lifeboat with you,” meaning she doesn’t want to be in a lifeboat with Gio because Gio won’t help anyone else if there is a serious pr oblem. He will look after himself or look out for himself before helping anyone else.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ana Maria: Did you see this news article about the Good Samaritan who stopped to help a stranger and died?

Gio: That’s his own fault. Who told him to meddle i n other people’s business?

Ana Maria: He wasn’t meddling. He saw that a fellow  human being was in distress and was selfless enough to try to help.

Gio: Doing a good deed, was he? Going out on a limb  to help someone in need, eh?

Ana Maria: Exactly. I call him a hero.

Gio: I call him a fool. You don’t put yourself in d anger to help a stranger. That’s just common sense.

Ana Maria: So you would have just walked right by a nd done nothing to help.

 Gio: If it meant putting myself in jeopardy. You sh ould always look out for yourself, no matter what the situation.

Ana Maria: Great, remind me never to get into a lif eboat with you!

This episode is a dialogue between Naomi and Omar a bout describing sounds that are made by humans and non-humans. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Naomi: Stop! Stop!

Omar: What’s the matter?

Naomi: My bike is making a strange sound.

Omar: What kind of sound?

Naomi: It’s a clanging sound followed by a hissing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.

Omar: Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.

Naomi: Okay, here goes. Hear that?

Omar: Yeah, but it’s more of a popping or pinging s ound.

Naomi: It sounded different when I was riding it. I ’ll get on and you run alongside. What do you hear?

Omar: I hear the whirring of the pedals and the cre aking and rattling of the chain, but no clanging sound.

Naomi: I’ll speed up. What do you hear now?

 Omar: Nothing, just the rustling of my own clothes.

Naomi: The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go  faster. Now what do you hear?

Omar: Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last g asp . . .

[end of dialogue]

Naomi shouts at Omar, “Stop! Stop!” Omar says, “Wha t’s the matter?” meaning “What is wrong?” Naomi says, “My bike is making a s trange sound.” A “bike” (bike) is a bicycle, something with two wheels and a seat, that you move by moving your legs up and down in a circle. Naomi say s her bike is “making a strange sound,” a strange noise. Omar says, “What k ind of sound?”

Naomi says, “It’s a clanging sound followed by a hi ssing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.” A “clanging (c langing) sound” comes when you have two pieces of metal that are hitting each other, such as two pans in your kitchen, something like this [clanging]. That’ s a “clanging” sound. “Clanging” comes from the verb “to clang” (clang).

Naomi says the clanging sound made by her bike is f ollowed by a “hissing” sound, or a “hissing noise.” “To hiss” (hiss) means  to make a sound similar to what I guess a snake would make. In fact, we often describe the sound made by a snake as being a “hissing sound.” It sounds a bit  like [hisses] – a bit like that. Naomi says her bike, which seems to be an amazing s ound machine, also makes a “buzzing noise.” “To buzz” (buzz) is to mak e a sound like a bee – something like this [buzzes].

Naomi says that she needs “to pinpoint where it’s c oming from.” “To pinpoint” (pinpoint) is to identify or find the exact place o r location of something. Naomi wants “to pinpoint” where this noise is coming from . Omar says, “Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.” Omar is telling Naomi to get off of her bike and walk with the bike  in her hands so that she can listen on one side of the bike and Omar can listen on the other side of the bike.

Naomi says, “Okay, here goes.” That expression “her e goes” is used immediately before you try to do something, especially if you’r e not sure if what you are going to do will be successful. For example, you may say to someone, “I’m going to sing you a song. I’m not a very good singer but, we ll, here goes,” meaning I’m

now going to do it. I’m now going to, in this case,  sing, even though I may not sing very well. I should probably say that every ti me before I try singing.

Naomi then says to Omar, “Hear that?” meaning “Do y ou hear that sound, that noise?” By the way, I’ve been using both the word “ sound” and “noise” in this explanation. A “noise” is usually a sound that isn’ t pleasant, that you don’t want to hear. If someone describes your singing as “nois e,” as my singing has often been described, well, that means the person doesn’t  like your singing very much. In any case, in our dialogue, Omar is trying to hea r the noise that Naomi hears.

He says, “Yeah” – meaning yes, I hear that noise – “but it’s more of a popping or pinging sound.” Omar thinks that the sound the bike  is making is more of a “popping” sound. “Popping” comes from the verb “to pop” (pop) which is to make a loud, short sound that is made, for example, if y ou have a balloon and then suddenly the balloon breaks. The verb we would use in that case would be “pop.” “The balloon pops.” It sounds something like this [ popping sound].

Did I scare you there? Were you drinking your coffe e and suddenly I made you spill it? Sorry about that. Oops, there I go again.  That’s a popping sound. “To ping” (ping) is to make a higher pitched sound. It is made by two things hitting against each other. It sounds something like this [ pinging sound]. We would describe that as a “pinging” sound, I think.

Naomi says, “It sounded different when I was riding  it,” meaning the bike was making a different sound when Naomi was actually on  the bike, riding it, rather than walking it as she was just now. She says, “I’l l get on” – meaning I will get on the bicycle – “and you run alongside. What do you h ear?” “To run alongside” (alongside) means to run next to something or someo ne. Omar says, “I hear the whirring of the pedals and the creaking and rattlin g of the chain, but no clanging sound.”

Omar says he hears some sounds as Naomi is riding t he bicycle, but they are different sounds. One of the sounds is coming from the “pedals” (pedals). The “pedals” of a bicycle are those two things you put your feet on in order to move the bicycle, in order to make the bicycle go forwar d. Your foot goes on the pedal. The “chain” (chain) of a bicycle connects the littl e wheel that you are spinning when you are moving the pedals up and down and the wheel in back of the bicycle – that round metal loop is called a “chain. ”

The pedals, according to Omar, are making a “whirri ng” sound. “Whirring” (whirring) is a sound made by objects that are movi ng very quickly through the air. Another whirring sound would be made by a heli copter, for example [whirring

sound]. Of course, a pedal doesn’t make a sound tha t loud. That’s a helicopter making a whirring sound. Omar describes the sound t hat the chain is making as a “creaking and rattling sound.”

We usually use the verb “to creak” when we are desc ribing a piece of wood that you are walking on and is making a sound. An old fl oor made of wood, for example, would probably creak. I’m not sure if a bi cycle chain would creak, but I guess it’s possible that something made of metal th at is put under a lot of pressure might also creak, making a high-pitched so und again. Here’s wood “creaking” [creaking sound].

Interestingly enough, there’s another word we used to describe noise which is “squeaking” (squeaking). “Squeaking” sounds like “c reaking” except it has a much higher pitch. The sound is a lot higher. Here would be an example of a door squeaking [squeaking sound]. So “creaking” is like “squeaking,” except it’s a lower sound.

“Rattling” is a noise that is made when two things are hitting each other. They could be made of metal or some other material. If y ou have a set of keys in your pocket, they could be “rattling” together, or a bun ch of coins could “rattle” as they hit each other and made noise. Here would be an exa mple of something “rattling” (rattling) – [rattling sound]. That’s a chain rattl ing. So, Omar doesn’t hear the “clanging sound” that Naomi heard. Naomi says, “I’l l speed up.” “To speed up” means to go faster, to increase your speed. Remembe r, Naomi is riding on her bicycle.

“What do you hear now?” Naomi asks. Omar says, “Not hing, just the rustling of my own clothes.” A “rustling” (rustling) sound is w hat we would describe as a gentle sound made by a soft object that is rubbing against another soft object. You can think of the leaves in a tree as rustling a gainst each other as the wind blows through the trees. Here would be an example of a rustling sound, although it sounds like the wind is blowing rather strong in  this example. Let’s listen [rustling sound]. That might be paper rustling in t hat example.

Omar says the only thing he hears is the rustling of his own clothes. He’s running so fast that he hears the wind against his own clot hing. Naomi says, “The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go faster.” Remembe r, Naomi is riding the bicycle and Omar is running next to her. She then says, “No w what do you hear?” Omar says, “Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last gasp . . .”

Omar is too tired to continue running. He says the only thing he hears is his own “panting.” “To pant” (pant) is something that a hum an or other animal does when

it breathes very quickly. You can hear the sound co ming from your mouth because you are very tired. If you run suddenly, or  walk up a lot of stairs, you might pant. Because you are so tired, you have prob lems breathing.

Omar is panting and the only thing he can hear is t he panting and his “last gasp.” Your “last gasp” (gasp) is the last thing you do be fore you die. It’s your dying breath. Sometimes you will hear on a TV show or mov ie someone who is just about to die, and the last thing you hear is their “last gasp” and then they die. Well, I didn’t die. I just finished our explanation .

And now we’ll listen to the dialogue one more time.

[start of dialogue]

Naomi: Stop! Stop!

Omar: What’s the matter?

Naomi: My bike is making a strange sound.

Omar: What kind of sound?

Naomi: It’s a clanging sound followed by a hissing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.

Omar: Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.

Naomi: Okay, here goes. Hear that?

Omar: Yeah, but it’s more of a popping or pinging s ound.

Naomi: It sounded different when I was riding it. I ’ll get on and you run alongside. What do you hear?

Omar: I hear the whirring of the pedals and the cre aking and rattling of the chain, but no clanging sound.

Naomi: I’ll speed up. What do you hear now?

Omar: Nothing, just the rustling of my own clothes.

 Naomi: The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go  faster. Now what do you hear?

Omar: Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last g asp . . .

# Altering Clothing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,227 – Altering Clothing.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,227. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast courses in Business and Daily English. You can also like us on  Facebook. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mom and Sa’ad about changing the size of your clothing. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Put on these pants and this shirt, come over h ere, and stand still. I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Hurry up. I need to let down the hems and take  up the sleeves. I don’t think I have to take in the pant legs, but I might have t o let out the waist a little.

Sa’ad: Ouch!

Mom: Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or y our hem will be uneven and your seams will be crooked. You and your brothers a re growing so fast I feel like a full-time tailor!

Sa’ad: Are we done?

Mom: No, we’re not. Stay right there. You can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Don’t “Oh, Mom” me. This machine doesn’t seem to be working. I hope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.

Sa’ad: Mom, since I’m growing so fast, I’ll probabl y grow out of these clothes in a couple of months. Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.

Mom: And what will you wear in the meantime, high w aters?

Sa’ad: No, shorts!

[end of dialogue]

We have in this dialogue a mother and her son. The mother says to her son, “Put on these pants and this shirt, come over here, and stand still.” The mother is telling the son to put on a pair of pants and a shi rt and then to walk over to her and stand still. “Stand still” means don’t move. Do n’t move your arms or your legs or any part of your body. The mother says, “I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.” The mother is going “to alter” some cl othing. “To alter” (alter) means to change or modify something, especially when we are referring to clothing.

You alter clothing so that it “fits” (fits) you bet ter. It is the correct size for you. “To fit” means to be the correct size for you, when ref erring to clothing. Mom wants to alter the brother’s clothing to fit her son, Sa’ad.  The son says, “Oh, Mom!” He says it in a way that indicates he’s complaining. H e doesn’t like what his mother is doing. The mother, however, says, “Hurry up. I n eed to let down the hems and take up the sleeves.” “To let (let) down” in this c ase means to increase the length of something, such as the length of the pants.

“Pants” are, of course, articles of clothing that y ou wear over your legs. If a pair of pants are too short, sometimes you can “let down  the hem” (hem) of the pants. The “hem” is the bottom of the pants, which often h as more material, more of the pant leg underneath. If you take out the “hem,” the  sewing that is on the bottom of the pant leg, there is often more material that can be pulled down to make the pants longer. That’s what Mom is doing in our dialo gue. She’s going to let down the hems. She also is going “to take up the sleeves .”

The phrasal verb “to take up” is the opposite of the phrasal verb “to let down” when we’re talking about clothing. “To take up” mea ns to shorten something, to decrease the length of something – in this case, Mo m wants to “take up the sleeves” (sleeves). The sleeves are the parts of a shirt that go over the arms. If you put on a shirt that is too big for you, the sle eves might be so long they go over your hands. In that case, you would need to ta ke up the sleeves. You would need to shorten them. Mom wants to take up the slee ves in Sa’ad’s brother’s clothes so that they fit him.

She says, “I don’t think I have to take in the pant  legs, but I may have to let out the waist a little.” There are two more phrasal ver bs that Mom uses here in talking about altering clothing. They are “to take in” and “to let out.” “To take in” means to make something smaller around, especially when we’re talking about the waist of pants or of a skirt. If you, for examp le, lose weight and you are now skinnier, your pants will be a little loose around the middle of your body, around your waist. You might have to take in your pants – that is, you might have to change them so that the waist is smaller.

Let’s hope that is a problem you have. For many peo ple, however, if you gain weight, if you get fatter, you might have “to let o ut” the waist of the pants. “To let (let) out” means to make the waist bigger. Sometime s it’s not possible to let out the waist of a pair of pants. Sometimes you just ha ve to buy a new, bigger pair of pants. Mom doesn’t think she’ll need to take in the  legs of the pants. She doesn’t think she’ll need to make the pant legs smaller, bu t she might have “to let out the waist a little” for her younger son.

Sa’ad says, “Ouch!” “Ouch” is the word we use when we are expressing pain, if someone hurts us. We may say, “Ouch!” (ouch). Mom s ays, “Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or your hem will be uneven an d your seams will be crooked.” “To be uneven” (uneven) means to be not s traight. “To be uneven” is the opposite of “to be even,” which is straight. Yo u want the bottom of your pants, the hems of your pants, to be even, not uneven.

Another word for “uneven” is “crooked” (crooked). S omething that is “crooked” is something that is not in a straight line, something  that is not even. There’s another meaning of the word “crooked,” which is to be someone who is dishonest, who takes money illegally. Many politici ans around the world are “crooked.” They are dishonest by taking money and d oing things because someone gave them money. Here, however, “crooked” j ust means not straight, not even.

Mom is worried that because her son keeps moving ar ound while she’s trying to measure and make alterations of the clothing, the s eams of the clothing will be “crooked.” “Seams” (seams) refers to the line of se wing where two pieces of the material, what we call “fabric” (fabric), come toge ther in a piece of clothing. So, if you look at a pair of pants, if you look at the leg s of the pants, there will be a “seam” – a place where the material or the fabric i s sewn together, is connected. That’s called a “seam.”

Mom says, “You and your brothers are growing so fas t I feel like a full-time tailor.” A “tailor” (tailor) is a person who sews clothing p rofessionally, who gets paid to

sew clothing. A tailor is often a person who makes clothing as well. For example, if you want to buy a nice professional suit – a sui t coat and pants – you might go to a tailor and have a suit made professionally tha t will cost you a lot of money. You might go to a tailor just to have your clothes altered – just to have them changed so that they will fit better.

A “tailor,” then, is someone who works and gets pai d for doing the kinds of things that Mom is doing for free in our dialogue and many  moms have done for free, including my own. The son says, “Are we done?” Mom says, “No, we’re not,” meaning “We are not finished.” “Stay right there. y ou can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.” A “crease” (crease) is a line in clothing that is made by using what’s calle d an “iron” (iron). An iron is a hot piece of metal that you put over clothing so that t he clothing is flat.

Sometimes, especially for a pair of formal pants, y ou want a crease in the pants. You want a line that you can see in the fabric. Mom  is going to have Sa’ad do a crease in the shirt. She wants him to do this befor e she puts the shirt “through the sewing machine.” The “sewing (sewing) machine” is a machine that sews or puts two pieces of fabric together with something c alled “thread” (thread). “Thread” is like a very thin piece of string that y ou would use in clothing in order to put two pieces of fabric or material together.

Once again the son goes, “Oh, Mom!” He’s complainin g again. Mom says, “Don’t ‘Oh, Mom’ me,” meaning don’t say that to me. Don’t complain to me. “This machine doesn’t seem to be working,” Mom says. “I h ope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.” “To stitch” (stitch) means to conne ct two pieces of fabric or material by putting the thread into the material in  the form of a circle. You typically take a sharp metal object called a “needl e” and you put it into the material with a piece of thread tied onto it, and y ou take the needle and pull it in and out of the material, forming little circles.

That’s “stitching” the material or the fabric toget her. Mom says she’s going to have “to stitch” all of these “by hand.” “By hand” means using her own hands, not using the sewing machine. Sa’ad says, “Mom, since I ’m growing so fast, I’ll probably grow out of these clothes in a couple of m onths.” “To grow out of clothes” means to get bigger so that you will no lo nger be able to wear a certain piece of clothing. When children grow up, they “gro w out of” the clothing they have and have to get new, bigger clothing.

The son is saying that he’s growing so fast that he ’s going to grow out of the clothes that Mom is working on right now in a coupl e of months. He says, “Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.” the term “growth spurt” (spurt)

refers to a period of time when a child grows very quickly. Even in a few months, the child gets taller or bigger. Sa’ad is saying th at Mom should wait and not alter these clothes right now, and instead alter them aft er he has another growth spurt.

Mom says, “And what will you wear in the meantime?”  meaning what will you wear between now and the end of your next growth sp urt. She says, “And what will you wear in the meantime, high waters?” “High waters” (high waters) are pants that are too short for you, pants that end se veral inches above the ankle. They’re called “high waters” because, of course, if  you were walking to the street and there was a lot of water in the street, your pa nts wouldn’t get wet because they are so high up on your legs.

Her son isn’t proposing to wear the pants as high w aters. He says, “No, shorts!” meaning he wants his mother to make the pants into a pair of shorts.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Put on these pants and this shirt, come over h ere, and stand still. I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Hurry up. I need to let down the hems and take  up the sleeves. I don’t think I have to take in the pant legs, but I might have t o let out the waist a little.

Sa’ad: Ouch!

Mom: Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or y our hem will be uneven and your seams will be crooked. You and your brothers a re growing so fast I feel like a full-time tailor!

Sa’ad: Are we done?

Mom: No, we’re not. Stay right there. You can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Don’t “Oh, Mom” me. This machine doesn’t seem to be working. I hope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.

 Sa’ad: Mom, since I’m growing so fast, I’ll probabl y grow out of these clothes in a couple of months. Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.

Mom: And what will you wear in the meantime, high w aters?

Sa’ad: No, shorts!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,228. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store which has additional courses in Business and Daily English. In this epis ode, we’re going to listen to a dialogue between Thomas and Celeste about designing  things to sell. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Thomas: What do you think of my creations?

Celeste: These are . . . interesting?

Thomas: They’re part of my new product line to be s old under my own label.

Celeste: Really?

Thomas: Yeah, I’m jumping in with both feet. Everyb ody advised me to get my feet wet by licensing a collection, but I don’t wan t to sell under someone else’s brand.

Celeste: I thought you started all this by doing cu stom work.

Thomas: I did, but I’m ready to produce an entire l ine I’ve designed according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs.

Celeste: I can understand that. Will you be selling  to trade or retail customers?

Thomas: Retail. I plan to have showrooms in every m ajor city. See? This is a sample of our product catalog.

Celeste: I see. Your products look high-end, but th ey’re intended for the mass market.

Thomas: That’s right. Do you want to take home a sa mple?

 Celeste: Um, I guess so. I’d never considered using  anything like that.

Thomas: Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you ’ll never go back!

Thomas begins our dialogue by asking Celeste, “What  do you think of my creations?” Your “creations” (creations) are things  that you create – that is, things that you make. Celeste says, “These are . . . inter esting?” Notice she asks this almost as a question because she’s not really sure what to say about them. Sometimes when we don’t want to criticize someone w hen we don’t like something, we may use an expression like “Well that ’s . . . interesting.”

Thomas says that his creations are part of his “new  product line” to be sold under his “own label.” A “product line” is a group of rel ated things or products that are sold by a certain company. They may be things that are all related to, I don’t know, haircare, or drinking coffee. A product line could include clothing that is related – a set of shirts or dresses might be part of a product line.

We’re not sure what Thomas’s product line is but we  know that he’s going to sell it “under his own label” (label). “To be sold under ” means it will be sold with the name of a certain “label.” A “label” is a part of t he packaging of a product that indicates what company has made the product. It’s u sed here more generally to mean “brand” (brand). Your “brand” is the name that  you use for selling certain kinds of products, certain kinds of things.

A big company may have several brands – several thi ngs that it sells under different names. For example, The Coca-Cola company  has different brands that it sells. One of the brands is, of course, Coca-Col a, but there are other brands, other kinds of things that it sells, other drinks t hat use different names. Brands such as Fanta or Minute Maid Orange Juice. They’re made by the same company but they are different brands. Thomas is go ing to be selling his product line or group of products under his own brand or la bel.

Celeste is surprised by this. She says, “Really?” T homas replies, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “I’m jumping in with both feet,” he sa ys. The expression “to jump in with both feet” means to begin to do something comp letely and immediately, without waiting. If you’re “jumping in with both fe et,” you’re going to commit 100 percent of your energy to do whatever it is you’re doing. You’re not going to go slowly or only commit part of your energy and money . You’re going to do it fully and immediately.

 Thomas says, “Everybody advised me to get my feet w et by licensing a collection, but I don’t want to sell under someone else’s brand.” The expression “to get your feet wet” is somewhat of the opposite of “to jump in with both feet.” “To get your feet wet” means to move slowly without  risking too much. You can think of going to a swimming pool. If you don’t wan t to get wet all right away, you might just put your feet in the water. You’re “gett ing your feet wet,” and then when you are ready, you’ll get the rest of your bod y wet – then perhaps you will jump in with both feet.

Thomas says that people told him, “advised” him, to  get his feet wet “by licensing a collection.” “To license” (license) something is to give someone permission to sell what you have made, which often includes the r ight to make something and sell it to someone else. A collection is similar to  a product line. It’s a group of products.

Some people told Thomas that he should license his collection – he should give his products to another person and have them make it and sell it. He wouldn’t make as much money that way, of course, but it woul d be less risky. It would not involve him as much, and therefore if things didn’t  work out well, he wouldn’t lose a lot of money. However, Thomas says he doesn’t wan t “to sell under someone else’s brand.”

Celeste says, “I thought you started all this by do ing custom work.” “Custom” (custom) means “customized,” or designed to meet on e particular client or customer’s needs. If you buy a suit from a store an d put it on, take it home and wear it, you’re not buying a “custom suit.” That su it, that jacket, and pair of pants wasn’t made for you. But if you go to someone who m akes suits and measures them to your particular body to make sure that it f its you perfectly, then you would be getting a “custom-made suit.” Thomas began worki ng by doing “custom work” for individual people.

Thomas says, “I did,” meaning yes, I did do that. “ But I’m ready to produce an entire line” – a complete product line – “I’ve desi gned according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs.” Thomas has designed or c reated something with particular characteristics – an “entire product lin e.” He’s done this, he says, “according to his vision” (vision). Your “vision” i s your image of what something should look like, your creative inspiration.

Thomas has designed this product line according to his vision, not according to his “client’s specs.” “Client” is another word for “customer” – someone who buys what you make or uses you for a certain service. the word “specs” (specs) refers

to the requirements or detailed information for som ething. “Specs” is short for “specifications” – the particular details about how  something should be made or done. Celeste says, “I can understand that,” meanin g she can understand Thomas wanting to work according to his own vision.

She says, “Will you be selling to trade or retail c ustomers?” “Trade (trade) customers” are other companies who will sell what y ou make. “Retail” (retail) are customers who buy directly from you. So if you make , say, coffee cups and you want to sell them, you could sell them to a store w hich would then sell them to individual people. That would be an example of a “t rade customer.” The store is your customer. A “retail customer” would be someone  who bought the cups directly from you – from your store, or perhaps now adays online. Thomas says he’s going to sell to retail customers.

He explains, “I plan to have showrooms in every maj or city.” A “showroom” (showroom) is a large room or a building where peop le can come and see the things that you have made. You are showing them the  things you have made so they will then, of course, buy them. A “major city”  is a large city. Thomas says he’s going to have “showrooms in every major city.”  He continues, “See? This is a sample of our product catalog.” A “catalog” (cata log) – it can also be spelled (catalogue) – is basically a book that shows people  photographs of the things that you are selling.

Celeste says, “I see. Your products look high-end.”  “High (high) – end (end)” means very expensive or of a very high quality. Cel este says that Thomas’s products look high-end in the photographs, “but the y’re intended for the mass market.” “Intended for” means they are meant to be sold to. The “mass (mass) market (market)” is the average consumer or the ave rage buyer. The “mass market” refers to perhaps the majority of people in  a certain area who might buy something. Normally, things that are intended for t he “mass market” are of a lower price and often of a lower quality.

Thomas, however, says, “That’s right,” meaning yes,  my products look high-end – they have the appearance of being high-end – but they’re intended for the average person, the mass market. He asks if Celeste  wants to take home a sample of his product. Celeste says, “Um, I guess s o.” We use that expression “I guess so” when we’re not very sure of our answer. S he says, “I’d never considered using anything like that.” We’re not sur e exactly what Thomas is giving her, but Celeste says she had never consider ed using something like his product.

Thomas then tells us what his product is. He says, “Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you’ll never go back.” A “toilet seat”  (seat) is what you sit on in the bathroom to do what your normally do in a bathroom – use the toilet. A “designer toilet seat” would be a special toilet seat that is  made perhaps of a higher quality or has some sort of special look to it.

Thomas says, “Once you sit on a designer toilet sea t, you’ll never go back.” That expression “you’ll never go back” means you will ne ver use a regular toilet seat again, in this example. “You’ll never go back” mean s, more generally, you’ll never use what you used to use before, because now you’ve  experienced this new wonderful thing.

I’m not sure if I’d recommend buying a designer toi let seat, but I would recommend listening to our dialogue one more time, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Thomas: What do you think of my creations?

Celeste: These are . . . interesting?

Thomas: They’re part of my new product line to be s old under my own label.

Celeste: Really?

Thomas: Yeah, I’m jumping in with both feet. Everyb ody advised me to get my feet wet by licensing a collection, but I don’t wan t to sell under someone else’s brand.

Celeste: I thought you started all this by doing cu stom work.

Thomas: I did, but I’m ready to produce an entire l ine I’ve designed according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs.

Celeste: I can understand that. Will you be selling  to trade or retail customers?

Thomas: Retail. I plan to have showrooms in every m ajor city. See? This is a sample of our product catalog.

Celeste: I see. Your products look high-end, but th ey’re intended for the mass market.

 Thomas: That’s right. Do you want to take home a sa mple?

Celeste: Um, I guess so. I’d never considered using  anything like that.

Thomas: Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you ’ll never go back!

This episode is a dialogue between Joshua and Rosa about how to tell other people to leave. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joshua:  Beat it and don’t come back!

Rosa:  What’s all the noise?

Joshua:  It’s the neighborhood kids. All I want to do on this sunny afternoon is sit out on the porch and enjoy the day. But those neigh borhood kids keep coming around and making all kinds of noise. Hey you, shoo !

Rosa:  They’re just trying to get a rise out of you . Maybe if you ignore them and stop waving them off and telling them to run along,  they’ll go away on their own.

Joshua:  If I don’t tell them to get lost, they’ll sit here in front of my house and clown around. They’ll make so much noise it’ll wrec k my peace and quiet. Hey, I see you. Take a hike!

Rosa:  I think I know what to do to get you that pe ace and quiet. I’ll be right back.

Joshua:  Where are you going?

Rosa:  I’m going to get a plate of cookies for thos e kids.

Joshua:  Are you crazy? Are you rewarding those row dy troublemakers with cookies?!

 Rosa:  It’s a bribe and it always works.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue by hearing Joshua say, “Beat it and don’t come back!” “Beat (beat) it (it)” is a rude, informal phrase we  use to tell someone to go away, to leave, to leave you alone. You may remember the Michael Jackson song “Beat It.” “Beat it, beat it. No one wants to be defeated .” No? Well anyway, there was this really popular song many years ago called “Bea t It” by this guy named Michael Jackson, and the expression meant in that s ong what Joshua means in our dialogue, which is to leave, to go away, but it ’s a very rude phrase. It’s a very impolite way of telling someone to leave. Joshua sa ys to someone, “Beat it and don’t come back!” meaning do not return here.

Rosa asks, “What’s all the noise?” In other words, why is Joshua yelling. Joshua responds, “It’s the neighborhood kids,” meaning it’ s the children who live near our house. “All I want to do,” meaning the only thing I  want to do, “on this sunny afternoon is sit out on the porch and enjoy the day .” Joshua wants to sit on his “porch” (porch) and enjoy his day. A porch is an ar ea in front of a house, often made of either wood or cement, that doesn’t have an y walls around it, although it will often have something overhead – a “roof” (roof ) – to protect you from the rain and sun.

Porches aren’t as common here in Los Angeles as the y are in other cities, especially with newer houses, but where I grew up it was quite common in the houses of my neighborhood to see people on their po rches – for houses to have porches, in fact. Almost none of the houses in my n eighborhood here in L.A. have porches. They’re just not as common in the hou ses in this area, and I think they’re not as common in newer houses.

In any case, Joshua is mad about the neighborhood k ids. He says, “Those neighborhood kids keep coming around” – that is, th ey keep coming close to his house – “and making all kinds of noise.” Joshua the n yells at another one of the neighborhood children. He says, “Hey you, shoo!” “S hoo” (shoo) is another informal word used to tell someone to go away. It’s  sometimes used humorously, as in making a joke, but Joshua isn’t joking here.

Rosa says, “They’re just trying to get a rise out of you.” “To get a rise (rise) out of” someone is to try to make someone react, especi ally react angrily. Usually people are doing this to annoy you and to get you t o react in a certain emotional way. I suppose it’s a way of controlling you in som e sense. Some people like to

do this on the internet. They like to make comments  on Twitter or Facebook to “provoke” (provoke) someone. “To provoke” means the  same as “to get a rise out of” someone – to make someone react in anger.

Rosa thinks these neighborhood children are just tr ying to get a rise out of Joshua. She says, “Maybe if you ignore them and sto p waving them off and telling them to run along, they’ll go away on their  own.” Rosa suggests that Joshua “ignore” (ignore) the children. “To ignore” means not to pay attention to something or someone, to pretend that you don’t eve n notice or see something.

“To wave (wave) someone off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to move your hand in the air, back and forth, indicating that so meone should leave or move away because you no longer want that person to be n ear you. “To tell someone to run along” (along) is similar to telling someone  to shoo, or to beat it. It’s telling someone to go away. However, it isn’t a rude expres sion necessarily. If someone tells you to run along, the person isn’t necessaril y being rude to you, although typically it would be an expression that someone in  authority would use with someone of lesser power.

A mother might tell her children to run along. A po lice officer might tell a teenager to run along. In both cases, they’re telling people  to move away – to walk away or to move away from where they are standing right now . We can also use this expression about ourselves. We can say, “Well, I ha ve to run along now.” That means “I have to leave now.” “I have to go somewher e else.” Rosa thinks that Joshua should stop trying to wave the children off or tell them to run along. If he did, “they’ll go away on their own,” meaning they’l l leave without anyone having to tell them to leave.

Joshua disagrees. He says, “If I don’t tell them to  get lost, they’ll sit here in front of my house and clown around.” To tell someone “to get lost” is the same as telling them “to shoo” or “to beat it” or “to run a long.” It’s a way of telling someone to leave, and it is once again a rude expression, t o be sure. Joshua says the children sit in front of his house and “clown (clow n) around.” “To clown around” means to be silly, to be goofy, to do things like a  child would do, often to make someone else angry or annoyed.

Joshua says, “They’ll make so much noise, it’ll wre ck my peace and quiet.” “To wreck” (wreck) something is to destroy or ruin some thing, to make something less valuable. Joshua is worried about the children ’s noise “wrecking his peace and quiet.” Your “peace (peace) and quiet (quiet)” is your calm environment where you are relaxed, where you are not stressed.

Joshua again talks to one of the children. He says,  “Hey, I see you. Take a hike!” “Take a hike” (hike), when used as a command, means  the same as “to get lost,” “to go way,” “to shoo,” and “to beat it.” And it is  also a rude expression. If you want someone to leave, you could just say, “You kno w what, take a hike.” It’s a very rude thing, a very impolite thing to say, howe ver. It’s probably not as common as it was when I was growing up, but you wil l still hear people say it.

Rosa says, “I think I know what to do to get you th at peace and quiet. I’ll be right back.” Rosa thinks she has a solution to Joshua’s p roblem of the noisy children. Joshua says, “Where are you going?” Rosa replies, “ I’m going to get a plate of cookies for those kids.” Rosa is going to give the children cookies. Joshua says, “Are you crazy?” meaning this is a dumb idea. “Are you rewarding those rowdy troublemakers with cookies?!”

Joshua can’t believe that Rosa is going to “reward those rowdy troublemakers.” “To reward” (reward) is to give someone a prize or a present or a gift because they’ve done something good. “Rowdy” (rowdy) refers  to an activity that is very loud and energetic, often annoying other people. A “troublemaker” is a person who, well, makes trouble – who causes problems. Jos hua can’t believe Rosa wants to give these loud, rowdy, troublemaking chil dren cookies.

Rosa says, “It’s a bribe and it always works.” A “b ribe” (bribe) is something you give to another person to make that person do somet hing for you. Bribes are often illegal, or against the law, especially if yo u are giving them to someone in the government. That doesn’t mean the person won’t accept your bribe, however, but a bribe more generally refers to money or gifts  that you give someone to do something for you, often something that they should  do anyway or often in a situation where you’re not supposed to give that pe rson anything to do what you want him or her to do.

Rosa thinks, probably correctly, that sometimes chi ldren will do what you want to do if you bribe them, and every parent probably wou ld agree.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joshua:  Beat it and don’t come back!

Rosa:  What’s all the noise?

Joshua:  It’s the neighborhood kids. All I want to do on this sunny afternoon is sit out on the porch and enjoy the day. But those neigh borhood kids keep coming around and making all kinds of noise. Hey you, shoo !

Rosa:  They’re just trying to get a rise out of you . Maybe if you ignore them and stop waving them off and telling them to run along,  they’ll go away on their own.

Joshua:  If I don’t tell them to get lost, they’ll sit here in front of my house and clown around. They’ll make so much noise it’ll wrec k my peace and quiet. Hey, I see you. Take a hike!

Joshua:  Where are you going?

Rosa:  I’m going to get a plate of cookies for thos e kids.

Joshua:  Are you crazy? Are you rewarding those row dy troublemakers with cookies?!

Rosa:  It’s a bribe and it always works.

# Expressing Disapproval of Elected Officials

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,230 – Expressing Disapproval of Elected Officials.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,230. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store with additional courses in Business and Daily English. You can also  like us on Facebook. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue between Donald and Hilar y about not liking the people who are elected to government positions. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hilary: Which candidate are you going to vote for i n the upcoming election?

Donald: Neither one. I’m not voting.

Hilary: What? You have to vote. Don’t you want to make your voice heard?

Donald: Neither candidate represents my views. They  each have their own political agendas that reflect the concerns of the elite, not people like you and me.

Hilary: To me, voter apathy is the real problem. Th ings won’t change if we don’t vote.

Donald: You’re not listening. Both candidates are i n the pockets of special interest groups and only care about pork-barrel pol itics. They’re not really concerned about the everyday challenges that you an d I face.

Hilary: That’s not true. Look at the platforms of e ach candidate. They each stand for different things.

Donald: That’s just lip service. They’ll say whatev er matches public opinion to get elected. No matter who gets into office, things wil l stay the same for regular folks like you and me.

Hilary: So you’re really not going to vote?

Donald: Nope.

Hilary: What do you hope to achieve?

Donald: Consider it a silent protest by the disaffe cted.

[end of dialogue]

Hilary begins by asking Donald, “Which candidate are you going to vote for in the upcoming election?” A “candidate” (candidate) is a person who is trying to get elected to a certain position, often a position in government, such as president or governor or senator. Hilary is asking Donald which candidate he’s going to “vote” (vote) for. “To vote” means to indicate which perso n you want to win an election or which position you are taking on some matter tha t you are being asked to vote on.

We normally vote for people, but in some states suc h as California, there are laws that you also vote on directly. Most of our la ws are voted on, or voted for, by our representatives. We vote for people who then vo te for laws, but in some cases, we vote directly on certain laws. Hilary is talking about candidates for whom Donald might vote in the “upcoming,” or soon-t o-take-place, “election.” An “election” (election) is a period when people vote.

Elections typically take place on one day, although  that isn’t always true. Sometimes you will have voting taking place over a couple of different days. More commonly now, people can vote by mail. So, you  can start voting even before the day of the election, when people actuall y go to a place in their neighborhood and vote. Just by coincidence – just b y chance – I’m recording this today, which is an Election Day in California, but I’m not going to vote today because I voted by mail last week. I sent in my “ba llot” (ballot). Your “ballot” is the piece of paper you use to vote.

Donald says, “Neither one. I’m not voting,” meaning  he’s not going to vote for either of the two candidates who are, we would say,  “running for office” – trying to get elected. In the U.S., there are two large impor tant political parties – the Democrats and the Republicans. In most elections, t here are two candidates – a Democrat and a Republican. That isn’t always true, but it’s often true.

Hilary says, “What? You have to vote.” Donald says he’s not going to vote and Hilary says he has to vote. She says, “Don’t you wa nt to make your voice

heard?” The expression “to make your voice (voice) heard” means to give your opinion in a way that makes other people know what you think. Donald says, however, “Neither candidate represents my views.” “ To represent” here means to have the same opinions that you have. Donald contin ues, “These two candidates each have their own political agendas that reflect the concerns of the elite, not people like you and me.”

A “political agenda” (agenda) is a list or a set of  ideas that you believe in, especially if you are someone in government. It’s a  list of things or a set of beliefs that you want to put into place or put into action.  “To reflect” here means the same as “to represent.” “To reflect” (reflect) mean s to be very similar to, in this case, your ideas, but Donald says that these candid ates don’t represent his ideas or his concerns, but rather the concerns or the thi ngs that are important to the “elite” (elite). “The elite” refers to the people i n a society who have the most money and the most power.

Hilary says, “To me, voter apathy is the real probl em. Things won’t change if we don’t vote.” “Apathy” (apathy) means a lack of inte rest or not being very enthusiastic or interested in doing something or pa rticipating in something. “Voter apathy” refers to the fact that some people don’t want to vote or are simply not interested in voting. Some people think this is bad  – Hilary, for example. I’m not so sure.

You may not be interested in voting because you thi nk everything is going fine in the world, or you may not be interested in voting b ecause you don’t think voting will make a difference. Sometimes that’s true. Some times it isn’t. I don’t know of any evidence that shows that the more people vote, the better government we get. Maybe if you aren’t interested in voting, it’s  because you haven’t been educating yourself and therefore don’t feel you sho uld vote, which in my opinion is a good reason not to vote. But many people disag ree with me, including Hilary.

Hilary says, “Things won’t change if we don’t vote. ” Donald says, “You’re not listening. Both candidates are in the pockets of sp ecial interest groups and only care about pork-barrel politics.” The expression “t o be in the pockets” (pockets) of someone means you are being influenced or contro lled by another person or group, probably because that person is giving you m oney. “Special interest groups” are organizations that try to influence gov ernment – groups that try to get their ideas adopted or put into action by the gover nment.

The term “pork (pork) – barrel (barrel) politics,” sometimes spelled without the hyphen between “pork” and “barrel,” refers to using  money to make a certain group of voters happy in order to get those voters to vote for a certain party or a

certain person. So, for example, if I’m a politicia n who has been elected to a government position, I might give money to certain groups or to certain people so that those people will vote for me in the future. Y es, this really happens all over the world, and probably in all periods of history.

Donald is complaining that these candidates only ca re about “pork-barrel politics,” meaning they don’t care about everyone, just about certain voters whom they’re trying to influence by giving them money. O f course, you can’t give voters money directly in exchange for them voting for you.  You do it in other ways. Donald says the candidates “are not really concerne d about the everyday challenges,” the day-to-day problems that people li ke Donald and Hilary face.

Hilary says, “That’s not true. Look at the platform s of each candidate.” A “platform” (platform), in the world of politics, re fers to a list of positions or ideas that a certain candidate or political party believe s in or stands for. In the U.S., every four years the two major political parties si t down and write their “platform” – the ideas that they believe in or the laws that t hey want to pass or get rid of. Hilary says that each candidate stands for differen t things. “To stand for” means to believe in, to take a position for or against a certain policy or idea.

Donald, however, disagrees. He says, “That’s just l ip (lip) service.” “Lip service” is a phrase we use to describe support or belief in  something that isn’t really sincere or that doesn’t represent any sort of actio n. Someone can say they’re for the environment, or they’re for doing something abo ut the economy, but they don’t actually do anything. To say something – that  you believe in something – but not to do anything about it is an example of “l ip service,” or “giving lip service,” we might also say.

Donald says, “These candidates say whatever matches  public opinion to get elected.” “Public opinion” refers to what people be lieve, what the majority of people believe. Donald says, “No matter who gets in to office,” meaning it doesn’t matter who gets elected, “things will stay the same  for regular folks like you and me.” “Regular folks” (folks) means normal people, o rdinary people, people like you and I. “No matter who gets into office,” Donald  says, “things will stay the same,” meaning things won’t change, “for regular folks.”

Hilary then asks, “So you’re really not going to vo te?” Donald responds, “Nope” (nope). “Nope” means no. It’s an informal way of sa ying no. Hilary says, “What do you hope to achieve?” meaning “What are you trying to accomplish by not voting?” Donald says, “Consider it a silent protest  by the disaffected.” A “protest” (protest) is some action that shows your disapprova l or disappointment in

someone or something. A “silent protest” would be n ot speaking or not doing something as a way of showing you are in disagreeme nt about something with another person or group.

“Disaffected” (disaffected) is an adjective used to  describe people who are not happy about the people who are in power, such as po liticians, and don’t want to support them in any way. People who are “disaffecte d” may be people who don’t vote, for example, because they are angry at everyo ne who is part of the political process. Please note that the names used in this di alogue do not represent any real people, especially not candidates for the pres idency of the United States.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hilary: Which candidate are you going to vote for i n the upcoming election?

Donald: Neither one. I’m not voting.

Hilary: What? You have to vote. Don’t you want to make your voice heard?

This episode is a dialogue between Paresh and Sandy  about having enough food for a big family when you don’t have a lot of money . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paresh: Are you shopping for an army?

Sandy: Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews have com e to live with me. I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them on a tight budget.

Paresh: My mother was a master at making a little g o a long way. There are seven kids in my family.

Sandy: What did she do?

Paresh: She only bought fruits and vegetables that were in season and generic or store brands.

Sandy: I’m trying to do that and also buying only s taples.

Paresh: My mother also bought in bulk and stocked u p when things were on sale.

Sandy: I’ll need to start doing that.

Paresh: She was also able spend less by using some time-tested recipes. She planned meals for an entire week and each ingredien t did double duty. Nothing went to waste.

Sandy: That sounds like a good plan.

 Paresh: My mom also never turned her nose up at day -old bread or marked- down food. She was amazing and she made it work.

Sandy: I need to take a cue from your mother. I lov e those boys but they’re going to eat me out of house and home!

[end of dialogue]

Paresh begins our dialogue by asking Sandy, “Are yo u shopping for an army?” “To shop” means to go and buy things. An “army,” of  course, is a large group of people, usually, who are fighting for a country as part of their military. So, the question “Are you shopping for an army?” is of cour se a joke. We can imagine that Sandy and Paresh are at the grocery store – a place where you buy food – and Sandy has a lot of food in her shopping cart, i n that little thing that you push around a store that you put your food in while you are shopping.

Sandy says, “Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews ha ve come to live with me.” Sandy says that she has three nephews – sons of eit her her sister or her brother – who are now living at her house. We’re not sure w hy. Sandy says, “I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them” – how I am going to giv e them enough food – “on a tight budget.” Your “budget” (budget) is the amount  of money you have to spend on something. A “tight (tight) budget” is the same as a “small budget,” which is not very much money, a very limited amount of money .

Paresh says, “My mother was a master at making a li ttle go a long way.” “To be a master” (master) at something means to be very good  at something. Paresh says his mother “was a master at making a little go a lo ng way.” “To make a little go a long way” means to be able to use a very small amou nt of money to do a lot of things, to be very efficient about the way you spen d your money. Paresh says, “There are seven kids in my family.” Paresh thinks he has a big family, but we all know he doesn’t really. I mean, I come from a famil y of 11 children so, Paresh – yeah, not so big.

Sandy says, “What did she do?” meaning what did you r mother do in order to feed all of you or give you all enough food. Paresh  responds, “She only bought fruit and vegetables that were in season and generi c or store brands.” When we say fruits or vegetables are “in season,” we mean t hat they are growing at this particular time of year, usually in the area where you live. For example, in the Midwestern United States, where I grew up, corn was  in season in August and September. That’s when the corn was ready to eat, t hat was being grown in the area around where I lived.

 Well, there wasn’t any corn where I grew up next to  me. I mean, I grew up in the city, but in the general area of Minnesota there wa s a lot of corn, especially in August and September. The corn was “in season.” Fru it and vegetables that are in season are usually cheaper, or less expensive to  buy. That’s one way that Paresh’s mother was able to feed her family. Paresh ’s mother also only bought “generic” (generic) or “store brands” (brands). A “ generic” or “store brand” is usually a product that is made to taste like or loo k like a more famous kind of product but is a lot cheaper.

For example, you can buy Coca-Cola, a type of soda,  at most American grocery stores, but you can also buy soda (or “soda pop,” a s it is called in some places) that tastes similar to Coca-Cola but has a differen t name on it. This is often a “generic” or a “store brand” that is produced at a cheaper price and that isn’t as expensive as a similar product made by a more famou s company. It’s not exactly like the more famous brand. You can’t buy pop or so da pop that tastes like Coca- Cola exactly, but it’s similar and it’s usually che aper. That’s a “generic” or “store brand.”

Sandy says she is trying to do something similar. S he’s also trying to buy only “staples.” A “staple” (staple) refers here to a bas ic ingredient that can be used in many different ways to make different kinds of food . A “staple,” at least in the United States, would probably include things like m ilk, eggs, salt, perhaps sugar, certain kinds of meat – these are ingredients or th ings you can make food out of that can be used in many different ways or that are  considered things that everyone needs or wants to eat.

In some countries, rice is a staple. You will eat r ice at almost every meal. In other countries, potatoes are a staple. They are things y ou eat all the time. Paresh continues, “My mother also bought in bulk and stock ed up when things were on sale.” “To buy in bulk” (bulk) means to buy a lot of something, to buy a large quantity of something. So, instead of buying, say, two cans of corn, you would buy 10 cans of corn. You would buy in bulk because often it’s cheaper to buy a lot of something.

There are stores here in the U.S. where you can onl y buy in bulk. You have to buy a lot of things of whatever it is you’re buying . Paresh’s mother also “stocked up when things were on sale” – that is, when they w ere being sold at a lower price by the store. “To stock (stock) up on” someth ing is a phrasal verb meaning to buy a large amount of something to use in the fu ture. Sandy says, “I’ll need to start doing that.”

Paresh continues, “She was also able to spend less by using some time-tested recipes.” Something that is “time-tested” is someth ing that has been used many times in the past, often in the past, by different people and has been found to be successful or has worked very well. A “recipe” (rec ipe) is written instructions about how to cook something. Paresh says his mother  “planned meals for an entire week and each ingredient did double duty.”

An “ingredient” (ingredient) is something that you combine with something else to make a certain kind of food. So, if you’re going to  make bread, you’re going to need flour as one of your ingredients. You’re proba bly going to use eggs and water and a few other things. Those are all “ingred ients” you use to make the bread. Paresh’s mother made each ingredient that sh e bought from the store “do double duty” (duty). The expression “to do double d uty” means to use something in two different ways.

“Nothing went to waste,” Paresh says, meaning every thing his mother bought, she used somehow in her cooking. Sandy says, “That sounds like” – or that appears to me to be – “a good plan,” a good idea. P aresh says that his mother “never turned her nose up at day-old bread or marke d-down food.” “To turn your nose (nose) up” at something means to refuse to do something because you think you’re too good for that thing, or you are be tter than something that you are being asked to do.

You may turn your nose up at working as a janitor –  cleaning toilets – because you think you are better than that. Paresh says his  mother “never turned her nose up at day-old bread.” “Day-old bread” would be  bread that was made yesterday and therefore isn’t fresh. If you go to a  bakery – a place that makes bread – “day-old bread” will be cheaper even though  it isn’t as good.

“Day-old bread” is an example of food that would be  “marked down.” “To mark down” the price of something is to reduce the price  of something, to make something cheaper to buy. Sandy says, “I need to ta ke a cue (cue) from your mother.” “To take a cue” from someone means to foll ow someone else’s example, to do what someone else has done. Cindy sa ys, “I love those boys but they’re going to eat me out of house and home!”

This is an old expression. “To eat someone out of h ouse and home” means to eat a lot of food, so much so that the parents don’ t have enough food to give everyone enough to eat. It’s a phrase used to descr ibe children who have big appetites, who like to eat a lot of food. Why do we  say both “house” and “home” in the expression, you may be wondering. I don’t kn ow. It’s just an old

expression. Sometimes there isn’t a logic to why ex pressions are the way they are. That’s just what we say – “to eat someone out of house and home.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paresh: Are you shopping for an army?

Sandy: Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews have com e to live with me. I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them on a tight budget.

Paresh: My mother was a master at making a little g o a long way. There are seven kids in my family.

This episode is a dialogue between Larry and Anat a bout intimidating a coworker – making a coworker feel fearful or somehow afraid.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Larry: How’s it going? You having fun?

Anat: You know full well that this is out of my are a of expertise, but I’m coping.

Larry: Is that what you’re doing? It looks to me li ke you’re making a mess of things.

Anat: Cut me some slack. I’ve only been working on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed.

Larry: You know what I think?

Anat: No and I don’t care.

Larry: I think you’re in over your head. Why don’t you step aside and let someone competent do the job.

Anat: No amount of heckling or trash talking will make me quit. I’m here for the long haul.

Larry: We’ll see about that. People more qualified than you are have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done aroun d here.

Anat: Talk all you like, but no amount of intimidat ion will get you what you want.

Larry: And you know what I want?

Anat: I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs, but it’ll be a cold day in hell before that happens.

[end of dialogue]

Larry begins our dialogue by asking Anat, “How’s it  going?” meaning “How are you doing? How are things going?” “You having fun?”  Larry says, meaning “Are you having fun?” Anat says, “You know full well tha t this is out of my area of expertise, but I’m coping.”

The expression “you know full well” is used when so meone pretends they don’t know or understand something, when someone says the y don’t understand something, but they really do. It might also be use d if you are just confused about why someone is saying something. For example, your wife may say, “Let’s go to the baseball game.” You look at her and you don’t u nderstand why she’s saying that. You may say to her, “You know full well that you don’t like baseball. So why do you want to go?” You’re confused in that case.

Anat isn’t confused. She knows that Larry knows tha t whatever she’s working on is out of her “area of expertise” (expertise). Your  “area of expertise” is something you know a lot about, something that you have a lot  of knowledge of. “Expertise” is related to the word “expert.” An “expert” is som eone who knows a lot about a certain topic. This thing that Anat is working on i s out of her area of expertise, meaning she is not an expert.

She says she’s “coping.” The verb “to cope” (cope) means to manage a difficult or challenging situation, especially when you’re no t very good at what you are trying to do or you don’t have the necessary tools or resources to do something. When you are placed in a very difficult or challeng ing situation, sometimes you don’t have the experience or knowledge or resources  – that is, things you can use to help you handle the situation. So you have “ to cope” the best you can. You have to manage the situation the best that you are able.

Larry says, “Is that what you’re doing?” He’s surpr ised that Anat thinks that she’s coping (meaning she’s doing okay but not very well) . Larry doesn’t even think she’s doing okay. He says, “It looks to me,” meanin g it seems to me, “like you’re making a mess of things.” “To make a mess (mess) of  things” means to create a lot of problems by doing things wrong, by doing thi ngs incorrectly.

Anat says back to Larry, “Cut me some slack” (slack ). The expression “to cut someone some slack” is used informally to mean to make something easier for another person by not being as hard on them or by n ot trying to give someone a hard time. If you give someone a job, a task, and t he person isn’t doing very well at it, you might decide to give the person more tim e. This would be one way of “cutting the person some slack.”

We also use this expression when someone is giving you a hard time, when someone is criticizing you. You might say to the pe rson criticizing you, “Cut me some slack,” meaning stop being so hard on me, stop  criticizing me. That’s the sense that Anat uses this expression here in the di alogue. She’s asking Larry to stop criticizing her. She says, “I’ve only been wor king on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed.”

The expression “to get up to speed” means to learn something quickly, to get the knowledge and skill that other people have in order  to do a certain task. If everyone else knows how to do something and you don ’t, you will need “to get up to speed.” You will need to know as much as everyon e else does, to learn what everyone else already knows. Larry says to Anat, “You know what I think?” meaning “Do you know what I think?” Anat says, “No and I don’t care,” meaning “I don’t care what you think, Larry.”

Larry, nevertheless, gives his opinion. He says, “I  think you’re in over your head.” The expression “to be in over your head” means to b e trying to do something that’s too difficult for you – to, we would say, “b e overwhelmed” (overwhelmed). “To be overwhelmed” or “to be in over your head” me ans that you are trying to do something that is too hard for you.

Larry says, “Why don’t you step aside and let someo ne competent do the job.” “To step aside” (aside) is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop doing something so someone else can do it in your place. “To step aside” can sometimes mean to literally move to one side if som eone is trying to get by you or if someone is trying to do what you are doing be cause you aren’t doing a very good job at it. “To be competent” (competent) means  to be able to do something well, to have the knowledge or skills to do somethi ng.

Larry doesn’t think Anat is competent to do the tas k she’s doing, but Anat responds, “No amount of heckling or trash talking w ill make me quit.” “To heckle” (heckle) means to interrupt what someone is doing b y yelling at them or saying mean things to them. We usually use this verb when someone is giving a speech, or if a comedian is telling jokes and someo ne doesn’t like the speaker or the comedian and so the person yells out insulting things at that person to get the

person angry or simply to interrupt the person. Tha t’s called “heckling.” “A person in the crowd heckled the speaker.”

“To trash (trash) talk” is to say mean things to an other person – insulting things – especially someone against whom you are competing, say, in a game or a sporting event. “To trash talk” means to criticize the performance or abilities of another person. Anat says that she’s not going to q uit just because Larry is “heckling” her or “trash talking.” She says, “I’m h ere for the long haul” (haul). To be somewhere “for the long haul” means for a long t ime, until the job is done – someone who’s going to do something, even if it’s d ifficult, until it’s completed.

Larry says, “We’ll see about that.” That expression , “We’ll see (see) about that” is used when you don’t agree with someone else’s predi ction, when you don’t agree that what the person is saying is going to be  correct. You think the person is wrong and you are right. “People more qualified than you have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done aroun d here,” Larry says. “To pack (pack) it in” is an expression meaning to give up, to stop doing what you are doing. “To get a taste of things” means to experien ce something in a small amount so you have a basic understanding of it.

Larry is saying to Anat that once she realizes how things are done in this particular job, she’s going “to pack it in,” becaus e other people who are more qualified, who have more skills than Anat, have qui t after they had “gotten a taste of how things are done.” Anat says, “Talk all you l ike,” meaning you can continue criticizing me and talking, “but no amount of intim idation will get you what you want.”

“Intimidation” (intimidation) is a feeling of fear because you believe someone else is better than you, or stronger than you, or more p owerful than you. The verb is “to intimidate.” So, “intimidation” is a state of b eing intimidated. Anat says she’s not going to be intimidated. She will not feel fear  based on what Larry has been saying. She thinks Larry is trying to intimidate he r to get what he wants.

Larry says, “And you know what I want?” Anat says, “I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs.” The expressi on “with your tail (tail) between your legs” means to feel embarrassed or hum iliated, to feel like a failure. You can think of a dog who is scared, or p erhaps afraid of something, running away with its tail between its legs. That i ndicates, at least we think, that the dog is somehow afraid of something. Anat says s he’s not going to go away with her tail between her legs, feeling humiliated or powerless.

She says, in fact, “It’ll be a cold day in hell bef ore that happens.” The expression “it will be a cold day in hell” is used to show tha t something is impossible, that something will never happen. We think of hell as be ing a hot place – traditionally, anyway – so it could never be cold in hell, and the refore that is impossible. So, if you say, “It will be a cold day in hell before (wha tever it is you think won’t happen),” you’re saying that that thing is impossib le, just as it would be impossible for it to be cold in a hot place like he ll.

There’s another related expression, “You have a sno wball’s chance in hell.” A “snowball” (snowball) is, of course, a little ball made out of snow, which is cold. Once again, it’s the same idea. There are no snowba lls in hell because hell is a hot place, therefore what you are saying or predict ing is impossible.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Larry: How’s it going? You having fun?

Anat: You know full well that this is out of my are a of expertise, but I’m coping.

Larry: Is that what you’re doing? It looks to me li ke you’re making a mess of things.

Anat: Cut me some slack. I’ve only been working on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed.

Larry: You know what I think?

Anat: No and I don’t care.

Larry: I think you’re in over your head. Why don’t you step aside and let someone competent do the job.

Anat: No amount of heckling or trash talking will make me quit. I’m here for the long haul.

Larry: We’ll see about that. People more qualified than you are have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done aroun d here.

Anat: Talk all you like, but no amount of intimidat ion will get you what you want.

 Larry: And you know what I want?

Anat: I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs, but it’ll be a cold day in hell before that happens.

# Improving Flexibility and Mobility

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,233 – Improving Flexibility and Mobility.

In this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Rashida and Phil about helping your body become more flexible – being able  to move your arms and your legs in the way you’re supposed to. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rashida: Hi, I’m Rashida and I’m your physical ther apist. I’m here to help you regain flexibility and mobility after your accident .

Phil: I’m really not sure I need a physical therapi st. I can move around pretty well right now.

Rashida: Aren’t you feeling stiffness in your arms and tightness in your shoulders?

Phil: Not really.

Rashida: Try lifting your arms over your head.

Phil: See? I’m fine.

Rashida: You can’t lift them above your shoulders. I can help you improve your range of motion. Now let’s check out your hips and legs.

Phil: There’s nothing wrong with my hips and legs!

Rashida: Can you bend at the waist and touch your t oes? Are you able to squat?

Phil: I probably could if I stretched and limbered up.

 Rashida: I think you need more than stretching. I’l l work you through some exercises that will strengthen your muscles and loo sen scar tissue. You’ll be able to move more freely. Don’t you want that?

Phil: W . . . W . . . Will it hurt?

Rashida: Only a little. Let’s get started.

Phil: Ow, ow, ow!

Rashida: We haven’t started yet.

[end of dialogue]

Rashida begins our dialogue by saying to Phil, “Hi,  I’m Rashida and I’m your physical therapist.” A “physical therapist” (therap ist) is a person who helps people who are either sick or perhaps injured to improve t heir physical movements – the movements of their arms and their legs, principally  – by using certain kinds of massages and exercises.

A physical therapist doesn’t use drugs or surgery, typically; rather, a physical therapist tries to help you regain, or once again h ave, the movement in your arms and your legs and the rest of your body that you’re  supposed to have. So if you, for example, break your leg, you might need a physi cal therapist to help you get the muscles in your legs strong again so you can wa lk normally.

Rashida says that she is here to help Phil “regain flexibility and mobility” after his accident. “To regain” (regain) means to recover, or  to get again, what you had before. So, if you used to be the number one person  at a certain activity – say, a video game – and then you lose your position as num ber one, you will want to regain it. You will want to get it back again. You will want to be as good as you were before.

In the dialogue, we’re talking about regaining “fle xibility” (flexibility). “Flexibility” is how you are able to move your body parts again, usu ally your arms and your legs. The flexibility you have allows you to move a round the way you want to. “Mobility” (mobility) is related to flexibility, ex cept “mobility” refers specifically to being able to move from one place to another, such as by walking.

Usually when we refer to “mobility,” we’re talking about the ability to walk. “Flexibility” can refer simply to one’s ability to move one’s arms back and forth,

for example, or to be able to put both arms straigh t up in the air. The two concepts are related, but refer to slightly differe nt things. Phil isn’t sure he needs a physical therapist. He says he can move around “p retty well,” meaning very well, “right now.”

Rashida says, “Aren’t you feeling stiffness in your  arms and tightness in your shoulders?” “Stiffness” (stiffness) is a feeling of  difficulty when you move your muscles, especially if you haven’t used your muscle s in a long time, or perhaps you’ve overused your muscles. You know, when you, f or example, get up one morning and your muscles are difficult to move, per haps because you were doing some physical activity yesterday that you don’t nor mally do. That would be an example of “stiffness” in your muscles.

“Tightness” (tightness) is similar to “stiffness.” It refers to a feeling of not being able to move your arms and legs the way you should be able to. When you try to move them, you may feel pain, for example. “Tightne ss” in some ways is the opposite of “flexibility.” “To be flexible” means t o be able to move without any pain or difficulty. Phil says he does not feel any stiffness in his arms or tightness in his shoulders. Your “shoulders” are, of course, where your arms meet your body.

Rashida says, “Try lifting your arms over your head .” “To lift” something means to raise it up in the air. Rashida is asking Phil to p ut his arms above his head. Phil says, “See? I’m fine.” He doesn’t have any difficul ty doing that. Rashida says, however, “You can’t lift them above your shoulders. ” So, Phil is not actually able to put his hands above where his shoulders are. She  says, “I can help you improve your range of motion.”

“Motion” (motion) refers to movement – moving thing s. Your “range” is how far or how much you can move – in this case, how much you could move your arms and legs, I suppose. Rashida says, “Now let’s check  your hips and legs.” Your “hips” (hips) refers to the area where your legs me et the rest of your body. Phil says, “There’s nothing wrong with my hips and legs! ” Rashida then asks Phil, “Can you bend at the waist and touch your toes?” “T o bend (bend) at the waist (waist)” means the same as to bend over – to stand,  usually, and then try to touch the ground with your hands.

Rashida tells Phil to “bend at the waist” and touch  his toes – with his hands, of course. Rashida then asks, “Are you able to squat?”  (squat). “To squat” means to bend your knees in order to lower the rest of your body closer to the ground. It’s almost like sitting, but you’re not actually sittin g on anything. You are instead bending your knees and bringing your body down towa rds the ground.

 Phil claims that he could probably squat if he “str etched and limbered up.” “To stretch” (stretch) in this case refers to slowly ex tending the length of your muscles as part of warming up before exercising or participating in some sort of physical activity such as a sport. “Stretching” is very common among “athletes” – people who play sports. “To limber (limber) up” is a two-word phrasal verb that means something very similar to the expression “to stretch.” It can also mean the same as “to warm up,” which is to get your body rea dy, your muscles ready to do physical activity.

Rashida says, “I think you need more than stretchin g. I’ll work you through some exercises” – meaning I will direct you to do some e xercises with me helping you – “that will strengthen your muscles and loosen sca r tissue.” Your “muscles” are the parts of your body that move the bones of your body back and forth. “To strengthen” (strengthen) means to make something st ronger, to make something more powerful.

Rashida wants to strengthen Phil’s muscles as well as “loosen (loosen) scar (scar) tissue (tissue).” “To loosen” something mean s to allow it to move freely. It means to make something less tight. “To tighten” is  the opposite of “to loosen.” “Scar tissue” refers to thick, dense tissue which i s a material in your body that sometimes is formed after you injure yourself, espe cially around your muscles.

Rashida tells Phil that if she is able to do these exercises with him, he’ll “be able to move more freely” (freely). “Freely” means witho ut any limitations, without any restrictions in his movement. Rashida then asks Phi l, “Don’t you want that?” meaning, “Is this something you want?” When we say,  “Don’t you want that?” we’re assuming that the other person does want it. Phil, however, is afraid that it’s going to hurt. It is going to cause pain. Rash ida says, “Only a little. Let’s get started.”

Immediately Phil starts to cry out in pain. Now rem ember, Phil seemed like such a tough guy, such a strong guy just a few minutes a go, but when Rashida says she’s going to start doing these exercises with Phi l, Phil says, “Ow, ow!” “Ow,” usually spelled (ow), is the sound we make when we are in pain. Rashida says, “We haven’t started yet,” meaning she hasn’t even s tarted doing the exercises and already Phil is complaining about the pain.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rashida: Hi, I’m Rashida and I’m your physical ther apist. I’m here to help you regain flexibility and mobility after your accident .

Phil: I’m really not sure I need a physical therapi st. I can move around pretty well right now.

Rashida: Aren’t you feeling stiffness in your arms and tightness in your shoulders?

Phil: Not really.

Rashida: Try lifting your arms over your head.

Phil: See? I’m fine.

Rashida: You can’t lift them above your shoulders. I can help you improve your range of motion. Now let’s check out your hips and legs.

Phil: There’s nothing wrong with my hips and legs!

Rashida: Can you bend at the waist and touch your t oes? Are you able to squat?

Phil: I probably could if I stretched and limbered up.

Rashida: I think you need more than stretching. I’l l work you through some exercises that will strengthen your muscles and loo sen scar tissue. You’ll be able to move more freely. Don’t you want that?

Phil: W . . . W . . . Will it hurt?

Rashida: Only a little. Let’s get started.

Phil: Ow, ow, ow!

Rashida: We haven’t started yet.

# Traveling With Pets

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,234 - Traveling with Pets.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,234. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com to download the Learning Guide for  this episode that will give you a complete transcript of everything we say. Thi s episode is a dialogue between Eva and Amin about traveling with your pets . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amin: I can’t stand to be away from Fifi for two we eks. Can’t we bring her along?

Eva: We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does n ot like to travel. We’ll board her.

Amin: What if we get a really big crate or carrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?

Eva: It won’t make a difference if she’s left out o n a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.

Amin: It’ll be well ventilated and the crate will b e large enough for her to turn around in.

Eva: She’ll still bark and whimper and you know it.  Do you want her to suffer?

Amin: Of course not. What if she can travel in the cabin with us?

Eva: She’s too big.

Amin: We could change our travel plans, drive inste ad of fly.

Eva: We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be  fine at the kennel.

Amin: She’ll have separation anxiety.

Eva: Are you talking about the dog or about you?

[end of dialogue]

Amin begins our dialogue by saying to Eva, “I can’t  stand to be away from Fifi for two weeks. Can’t we bring her along?” The expressio n “I can’t stand” means “I am not able to deal with” or “I’m not able to toler ate.” We can use this expression in a lot of different ways. If someone is making a lot of noise next to us, you might say, “I can’t stand the noise you’re making.” That means it really bothers me. It makes me upset. It makes me perhaps angry.

In the dialogue, Amin is saying that he isn’t going  to like to leave Fifi for two weeks. “Fifi,” we learn, is the name of his dog. “C an’t we bring her along?” he asks. “To bring someone along” (along) means to bri ng someone with you, to take someone with you on a trip.

Eva says, “We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does not like to travel. We’ll board her,” she says. “To board” (board) means to p ay someone to take care of your animal, usually a dog, for a certain amount of  time. If you own a dog and you are going to be traveling, you can take it to a  place that will take care of it while you are gone. The verb we would use there wou ld be “to board” the dog. These places are usually called “kennels” (kennels) .

Amin says, “What if we get a really big crate or ca rrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?” Amin is trying to think of a way t o take the dog with them, so he suggests getting a big “crate” (crate). A crate is a large wooden box. A “carrier” (carrier) is any sort of box that can be lifted up using what we would call “handles” (handles). Handles are basically straps –  pieces of material that are connected to the box that you can use to put your h ands around in order to lift the box up.

Eva says, “It won’t make a difference if she’s left  out on a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.” We’re talking now about  an airplane. When you travel on an airplane, the airplane in the airport is parked on or sits on what’s called a “tarmac” (tarmac). A tarmac is a large are a at the airport that the airplanes drive on or go across on before they go u p in the air. A “cargo (cargo) hold (hold)” is a large area on the bottom of an ai rplane, although it could be in a ship as well, that is used to keep or store suitcas es, boxes, and other large objects.

Eva is saying it won’t be very practical to try to do what Amin is suggesting, but Amin isn’t giving up. He says, “It’ll be well venti lated and the crate will be large enough for her to turn around in.” “Ventilated” (ve ntilated) means having a lot of air going through a certain space or a room. If you  are inside a room, you want

the room to be “well ventilated” – air moving in an d out of it so that you’re not breathing in the same air. The opposite of “ventila ted” would be “stuffy” (stuffy). Amin says that this crate he’s thinking of will be well ventilated and will be large enough for the dog “to turn around in.”

“To turn around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning  to move 180 degrees in the opposite direction. So, if you are looking north, y ou will turn your body so that you are looking south. The verb we would use here actua lly would be “facing south” and “facing north.” “To face” (face) means to turn your body in a certain direction so that the front of your body, your face, is point ed in a certain direction. Interestingly enough, the verb “to face” can also m ean “to deal with.” We have “to face our problems.” We have to deal with or take ca re of our problems.

Eva says the dog will still “bark and whimper.” “To  bark” (bark) is the verb we use to describe the way a dog makes sound. There’s also  a noun which is “bark.” A dog “barks” – woof, woof. The sound made by a cat i s described by using the verb “to meow” (meow) – meow, meow. That, at least in English, is the sound a cat makes. Cats make different sounds in different languages. It’s very strange, but then again, so are cats, which is why you shoul d never own one.

Eva is saying that even in this crate, the dog is s till going to bark and “whimper” (whimper). “To whimper” is to make a soft sound tha t usually indicates you are sad or scared or perhaps in pain. Eva then asks Ami n, “Do you want her,” meaning the dog, “to suffer?” “To suffer” (suffer) means to experience some sort of pain or to be in a difficult situation or underg oing a difficult experience. Amin says, “Of course not.” He doesn’t want her to suffe r.

Then he says, “What if she can travel in the cabin with us?” The “cabin” (cabin) is the part of an airplane in which the human beings a re located. It’s where you sit in an airplane. The cabin is usually on the top par t of the airplane and the cargo hold is on the bottom part of the airplane. Eva say s, however, that the dog is too big to travel in the cabin with them. Amin says, “W e could change our travel plans, drive instead of fly.” Eva says, “We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be fine at the kennel.”

Amin says, “She’ll have separation anxiety.” “Separ ation” (separation) comes from the verb “to separate,” which means to take tw o things and pull them apart or put them apart so that they are not next to each  other. “Anxiety” is a feeling of sadness or fear or perhaps just worry about somethi ng. “Separation anxiety,” then, is the feeling of sadness or fear that you fe el when you are separated from another person.

In this case, Amin thinks the dog will have separat ion anxiety being away from her owners. Eva then asks, “Are you talking about t he dog or about you?” meaning of course that it is Amin who will feel the  separation anxiety because he won’t be near his dog.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Amin: I can’t stand to be away from Fifi for two we eks. Can’t we bring her along?

Eva: We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does n ot like to travel. We’ll board her.

Amin: What if we get a really big crate or carrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?

Eva: It won’t make a difference if she’s left out o n a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.

Amin: It’ll be well ventilated and the crate will b e large enough for her to turn around in.

Eva: She’ll still bark and whimper and you know it.  Do you want her to suffer?

Amin: Of course not. What if she can travel in the cabin with us?

Eva: She’s too big.

Amin: We could change our travel plans, drive inste ad of fly.

Eva: We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be  fine at the kennel.

Amin: She’ll have separation anxiety.

Eva: Are you talking about the dog or about you?

# Joining a Secret Society

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,235 – Joining a Secret Society.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,235. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store with additional courses in Business and Daily English. T his episode is a dialogue between Nathan and Mia about joining a secret group , a secret society. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nathan: Can you keep a secret?

Mia: Sure.

Nathan: I’ve been initiated into a secret society a t school. I’m one of the chosen few.

Mia: Is it supposed to be a big deal?

Nathan: Of course it is. It’s very exclusive. Not m any people are invited to join.

Mia: But what’s the purpose of this secret society?

Nathan: Well, we have a secret handshake and we hav e some really mysterious rites and rituals.

Mia: What kinds of rites and rituals?

Nathan: I can’t tell you. I’ve been sworn to secrec y.

Mia: But what is the purpose of the society? Do you  have some goal to accomplish, some reason for existence?

Nathan: The point is that the members are bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.

Mia: You mean like you’d take a bullet for each oth er?

Nathan: Well, no.

Mia: Or protect each other at all costs, even by ly ing and cheating?

Nathan: No, at least I wouldn’t.

Mia: Then what does it all amount to?

Nathan: If anyone asks us about it, we deny its exi stence. We have a secret that no one else knows.

Mia: Not anymore.

[end of dialogue]

Nathan begins our dialogue by asking Mia a question : “Can you keep a secret (secret)?” “Secret” is information that you don’t t ell anyone else, that you keep private. Mia says, “Sure. I can keep a secret,” mea ning “I can get information and then not tell anyone else about it.” Nathan says, “ I’ve been initiated into a secret society at school.” “To initiate” (initiate) means to formally or officially allow someone into an organization, usually with some sor t of special ceremony, some sort of special set of actions.

Nathan says that he has been “initiated into,” or m ade a member of, “a secret society.” A “secret society” is an organization who se members don’t talk about what goes on inside of the organization. Sometimes a secret society isn’t known to very many people – that is, not very many people  know about it – but in some cases a secret society can be well-known – that is,  lots of people know that it exists, but only the people inside of this group or  society know what happens in the group.

There are some universities that have secret societ ies. Most famously, Yale University has some secret societies. Nathan has be en made a member of a secret society at his school. He says, “I’m one of the chosen few.” That expression “the chosen (chosen) few” refers to a sm all group of people who are better than others – who are chosen, who are select ed, because they meet certain qualifications. We might also use the word “elite” (elite) to describe this concept.

Mia says, “Is it supposed to be a big deal?” meanin g “Is this something important?” Nathan says, “Of course it is. It’s ver y exclusive.” Something that is “exclusive” (exclusive) is limited to a small numbe r of people. There are only very few people who are allowed into this group. “Not ma ny people are invited to join,” Nathan adds. Mia says, “But what’s the purpose of t his secret society?” Nathan says, “Well, we have a secret handshake and we have  some really mysterious rites and rituals.”

A “handshake” (handshake) is what happens when you put your hand in someone else’s hand. A “secret handshake” is a spec ial way of holding or touching someone else’s hand when you meet them tha t only people in a secret society know. Nathan says his secret society has a secret handshake. So, when two members of this group meet each other, instead of just shaking hands as two people would normally, they do something special wi th their hands. I don’t know what, of course, because it’s secret.

Nathan says his group also has some “mysterious rit es and rituals.” Something that is “mysterious” (mysterious) is something that  many people wonder about or are interested in but don’t understand. A “rite” (r ite) – notice the different spelling, not (right) – is one part of a larger ceremony, som ething that people do together as a group. The word “rite” is normally associated with a religious ceremony, a religious event, but here it’s associated with what  happens in this secret society.

A “ritual” (ritual) is something that is done in a ceremony or celebration repeatedly, every time the ceremony takes place. A “ritual,” however, could also describe anything that someone does repeatedly as p art of a larger event or process. The difference between “rite” and a “ritua l” is that a rite is usually something that involves several different rituals a nd words, or speeches, or other kinds of actions.

A ritual is part of a rite, or could be part of a r ite, but the word “rite” is usually used to describe a whole set of rituals or a group of rituals and texts that are part of some ceremony – often a religious ceremony, but not always religious as is seen in this example, because the secret society ha s rites as well. Mia is curious. She says, “What kinds of rites and rituals?” Nathan  says correctly, “I can’t tell you.” Of course, if it’s a secret society you can’t  tell anyone what goes on in the secret society.

Nathan says, “I’ve been sworn to secrecy.” “To be s worn (sworn) to secrecy” means to have made a promise to someone or some gro up of people not to talk about a certain topic, not to share secret informat ion. Mia says, “But what is the

purpose of the society? Do you have some goal to ac complish, some reason for existence?” That is, is there some reason why you h ave this group?

Nathan responds, “The point is that the members are  bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.” Nathan says the rea son the society exists is that its members are “bound (bound) by an allegiance (al legiance).” An “allegiance” is loyalty or commitment to another person. If you are  bound by something, you are obligated. You have to do it. So, “to be bound by a n allegiance to each other” means you are committed to loyalty to helping other  people – in this case, other people in your society. Mia then asks, “You mean li ke you’d take a bullet for each other?”

The expression “to take a bullet” (bullet) means to  die in order to protect another person by getting in the way of a bullet from a gun  that might be aimed at that person or heading towards that person. The most fam ous example of this would be the people who protect the president of the Unit ed States. These group of people are called the “Secret Service,” and their j ob is, in fact, to take a bullet for the president – that is, to protect the president e ven if it means getting in front of the president if someone is trying to shoot the pre sident.

More generally, the expression means that you would  die for another person in order to protect that person. Mia is asking if this  secret society is about having each other protect each other even if it means deat h. Nathan says, “Well, no.” Mia says, “Or protect each other at all costs, even  by lying and cheating?” “At all costs” (costs) means no matter what, in all circums tances or all situations. Nathan says no, the secret society doesn’t mean tha t you would protect other members at all costs. Nathan says he wouldn’t do th at.

Mia then asks, “Then what does it all amount to?” S he’s asking what is the value or purpose of this society. That’s what the express ion “to amount to” means. What is its purpose? What is its importance? What i s its significance? Nathan responds, “If anyone asks us about it,” meaning ask s us about the secret society, “we deny its existence.”

“To deny” (deny) means to say that something does n ot exist – to reject or refuse something. Some people deny reality. They decide th at even though something is obviously true or something obviously exists, th ey say, “Oh no, it isn’t true. It doesn’t exist.” That’s what Nathan means when he sa ys that the members of his secret society deny the society’s existence. They s ay, “Oh no, there is no such thing as a secret society.”

He says, “We have a secret that no one else knows,”  but of course Nathan has just told Mia about his secret society, which is wh y Mia says at the end of our dialogue, “Not anymore,” meaning “Well, it used to be secret, but because you told me about your secret society, it is no longer a secret because I know about it.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nathan: Can you keep a secret?

Mia: Sure.

Nathan: I’ve been initiated into a secret society a t school. I’m one of the chosen few.

Mia: Is it supposed to be a big deal?

Nathan: Of course it is. It’s very exclusive. Not m any people are invited to join.

Mia: But what’s the purpose of this secret society?

Nathan: Well, we have a secret handshake and we hav e some really mysterious rites and rituals.

Mia: What kinds of rites and rituals?

Nathan: I can’t tell you. I’ve been sworn to secrec y.

Mia: But what is the purpose of the society? Do you  have some goal to accomplish, some reason for existence?

Nathan: The point is that the members are bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.

Mia: You mean like you’d take a bullet for each oth er?

Nathan: Well, no.

Mia: Then what does it all amount to?

Nathan: If anyone asks us about it, we deny its exi stence. We have a secret that no one else knows.

Mia: Not anymore.

# Dressing Inappropriately for Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,236 – Dressing Inappropriately for Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,236. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about wearing the right clothes to work. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Thierry: I know it’s casual Friday, but some people  just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.

Olga: I was thinking the same thing. Look at Sandy.  What she’s wearing is far too revealing.

Thierry: I was actually thinking about Jimmy. He’s wearing cutoffs and flip-flops. Where is his professionalism?

Olga: Don’t they know how they’re dressed can affec t their careers? Some people can’t see past poor fashion choices.

Thierry: Yeah, so many people are closed-minded and  think what people wear reflects their ability.

Olga: I’ve known a lot of people like that. Me? I a lways err on the side of caution.

Thierry: Is that why you never dress down?

Olga: That’s right. And I’ve noticed you don’t eith er.

Thierry: No, just because we suspend the dress code  one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.

 Olga: True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really  comfortable.

Thierry: Yeah, they do. It must be nice to walk aro und the office without dress shoes. Maybe, just once, I’ll come to work in short s next week.

Olga: What?! After everything you’ve said?

Thierry: I was thinking of tasteful shorts, nothing  tacky.

Olga: Just remember that it’s a slippery slope, my friend. I hope to never see you here in a tank top!

[end of dialogue]

Thierry says to Olga, “I know it’s casual Friday, b ut some people just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.” If something is “casual” (casual), it is not formal. It’s more relaxed. It’s, we could also say,  “informal.” Now, in most offices, in most businesses, everyone has to wear good cloth ing every day of the week. However, some offices have what is called “casual F riday,” meaning that you don’t have to wear, for example, a tie or a suit co at. You can dress more casually. You don’t have to dress, as we would say,  “professionally” or formally as you do every other day of the week.

Not all offices do that, but some offices do have t his casual Friday policy. Thierry is complaining, however, that even though it’s casu al Friday, there are some things that you shouldn’t wear to work. He says, “s ome people don’t know how to dress appropriately.” “To dress,” as a verb, means to put clothes on your body. The word “dress” is also a noun that refers to what  a woman would wear.

A “dress” is usually one piece of clothing that cov ers both the top and part of the bottom of a woman’s body, but as a verb, “to dress”  means simply to put clothing on, and “to dress appropriately” means to dress the  way you should dress for a certain situation. If you are going to a wedding, d ressing appropriately usually means wearing formal clothing, not your bikini or b athing suit. Although here in Los Angeles, that might be okay. I’m not sure.

Olga says, “I was thinking the same thing,” meaning  I agree with you that some people don’t know how to dress appropriately for wo rk. She then says, “Look at Sandy. What she’s wearing is far too revealing.” To  describe clothes as “revealing” (revealing) means to say that they show  too much of your skin. That

adjective is especially used for clothing a woman m ight wear that is showing too much of her bare skin, although it could be applied  to men’s clothing as well.

Thierry says, “I was actually thinking about Jimmy.  He’s wearing cutoffs and flip- flops. Where is his professionalism?” “Cutoffs” are  shorts that are made by cutting off the legs of pants, especially jeans. the key to “cutoffs” is that when you cut off the bottom of the pant leg, you don’t s ew up the bottom of the shorts, or what are now shorts, to make them look nice. So “cutoffs” are very informal. They don’t look very “dressy,” we might say. They d on’t look very formal. Of course they are shorts, and so by definition usuall y shorts are not formal wear.

“Flip-flops” (flip-flops) are basically a very simp le kind of sandal, which is something that you wear on your feet. It’s a type of shoe that you wear on your feet that doesn’t have a top on it. That’s what a s andal is. “Flip-flops” are a type of sandal that you would wear to, say, the beach. T hat’s why Thierry is asking about Jimmy’s “professionalism” – that is, his abil ity to behave appropriately in a business or professional situation.

Olga continues complaining. She says, “Don’t they k now how they’re dressed can affect their careers?” She’s saying that the pe ople who are dressing this way don’t realize that the way you dress can affect how  well you do at work and what kind of jobs you can get. Olga says, “Some people c an’t see past poor fashion choices.” The expression “to not be able to see pas t” something means that someone is unable not to notice something even thou gh you are perhaps trying not to notice.

For example, if someone comes to you and asks for a  job, and that person doesn’t look like he dressed very well to meet you,  or perhaps didn’t comb his hair or shave his face, you – even though you think  this might be a good person – might not be able to see past the way the person looks. In other words, you can’t ignore it even though you want to, even thoug h you may think it’s not important the way a person dresses in terms of how he might be able to do a certain job.

Olga is saying that some people won’t be able to lo ok past the way these people are dressed when determining whether they are going  to give them jobs. “Fashion” (fashion) refers to the way that clothing  is designed, the way it looks. Thierry says, “Yeah, so many people are closed-mind ed and think what people wear reflects their ability.” Thierry is also compl aining about “closed-minded” people. “To be closed-minded” means that you only s ee your own opinion, or only consider your own ideas, and are not able to c onsider other people’s ideas.

The opposite of “closed-minded” would be “open-mind ed.” Thierry is describing closed-minded people as those who think that what p eople wear “reflects their ability.” “To reflect” (reflect) here means to be r elated to or to be an indicator of something. If I say, “The way you dress reflects your ability,” I’m saying that the way that you look is an indication of how well you will do a certain job. Now, of course, we may know that that’s not true – unless t he job is to be a model, I guess – but nevertheless, people often think that.

Olga says, “I’ve known a lot of people like that” –  that is, who are closed-minded. “Me? I always err on the side of caution.” The expr ession “to err (err) on the side of caution (caution)” means to be very careful to n ot take any risks. I should mention that that word “err” (err) is now often pro nounced – somewhat mistakenly, but now more commonly – as “err,” as th ough it were spelled (air). In fact, it’s so common that it’s probably considered by most people an acceptable pronunciation in American English.

In British English, however, it is always pronounce d “err.” What does “err” mean? it means to make an error. It means to make a mista ke. You can see why people pronounce the word “err” (air) instead of “err” (er r) because we also have the word “error,” which is pronounced with that “air” s ound instead of an “err” sound – but anyway, back to our story.

Thierry says, “Is that why you never dress down?” H e’s asking Olga the reason why she never dresses casually. “To dress down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to dress casually. Olga says, “That’s right . And I’ve noticed you don’t either.” Olga and Thierry are saying to each other that because other people are closed-minded and might think that the way one dres ses reflects one’s abilities, they themselves never dress casually at work, even on casual Friday.

Thierry says, “No, just because we suspend the dres s code one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.” A “ dress code” (code) refers to rules about how you are supposed to dress. “To susp end” (suspend) means to stop doing something for a short period of time, to  temporarily stop doing something. Olga says, “True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really comfortable.”

Thierry says, “Yeah, they do. It must be nice to wa lk around the office without dress shoes.” “Dress shoes” are formal shoes. “Mayb e, just once, I’ll come to work in shorts next week.” Thierry and Olga are say ing that it is, in fact, more comfortable to dress casually, and perhaps they sho uld do the same thing as everyone else. Olga says, “What?! After everything you’ve said?” She’s surprised

that Thierry is thinking of wearing shorts after cr iticizing other people for wearing shorts.

But Thierry says, “I was thinking of tasteful short s, nothing tacky.” If something is “tasteful” (tasteful), it shows good judgment. It l ooks, we might say, “classy” or “refined.” Something is tasteful if it is dignified , appropriate especially for a formal setting. The opposite of tasteful is “tacky” (tacky ). “Tacky” is something that shows poor judgment, something that is of, we might  say, a low class.

Olga says, “Just remember that it’s a slippery slop e, my friend.” A “slippery (slippery) slope (slope)” is a term used to describ e a decision or an action that could in the future lead to problems, especially if  we are talking about changing the rules or doing some sort of action that may see m small now but would later cause further problems.

An example: if I say to my teenage daughter, if I h ad a teenage daughter, “You must be home by ten o’clock tonight and you cannot come home later than ten o’clock.” My daughter might say, “Well, Dad, I want  to come home at 10:15.” And you say, “Oh, well, okay, 10:15.” You may start going down a slippery slope. My daughter or son might come back to me and say next week, “Well, you said I could come back at 10:15, why not 10:30? It’s only 15 minutes later.”

You see here now the problem – that now that you ha ve allowed her to come back 15 minutes later once, she’s going to start pu shing you so that it will be even later, and later, and later. That’s what we wo uld call a “slippery slope.” One small action, one small change in the beginning, ca n lead to problems in the future. Olga is worried that if Thierry wears short s next week, it will be a slippery slope – that is, in the future he’ll wear even more  casual clothing.

She then ends with a joke. She says, “I hope to nev er see you here in a tank top.” A “tank (tank) top (top)” is a shirt that doe sn’t have any sleeves on it, and usually the shirt has a very narrow piece of, or st rip of, material over the shoulders. Both men and women can wear tank tops. T ank tops show the skin of your shoulders and around your neck as well.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Thierry: I know it’s casual Friday, but some people  just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.

 Olga: I was thinking the same thing. Look at Sandy.  What she’s wearing is far too revealing.

Thierry: I was actually thinking about Jimmy. He’s wearing cutoffs and flip-flops. Where is his professionalism?

Olga: Don’t they know how they’re dressed can affec t their careers? Some people can’t see past poor fashion choices.

Thierry: Yeah, so many people are closed-minded and  think what people wear reflects their ability.

Olga: I’ve known a lot of people like that. Me? I a lways err on the side of caution.

Thierry: Is that why you never dress down?

Olga: That’s right. And I’ve noticed you don’t eith er.

Thierry: No, just because we suspend the dress code  one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.

Olga: True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really  comfortable.

Thierry: Yeah, they do. It must be nice to walk aro und the office without dress shoes. Maybe, just once, I’ll come to work in short s next week.

Olga: What?! After everything you’ve said?

Thierry: I was thinking of tasteful shorts, nothing  tacky.

Olga: Just remember that it’s a slippery slope, my friend. I hope to never see you here in a tank top!

This episode is a dialogue about how to spend money . Sounds like fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ezra: Wait a minute. What happened to the $500 in o ur joint account?

Charlotte: I probably paid bills with it. You know that our paychecks barely cover our monthly expenses.

Ezra: I know, but I was counting on that $500 to pa y for new tires for my car.

Charlotte: Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it, if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it for s ome new shoes.

Ezra: Forget it. The tires are a necessity and your  shoes are not. We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spe nding for nonessentials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category.

Charlotte: You don’t need to spend $500 for a set of new tires. You just want to splash the cash for some fancy ones.

Ezra: Let’s stop arguing about who gets to spend the money and first figure out what happened to it. According to this, the money w as withdrawn from our account for automatic contributions to our retireme nt accounts.

Charlotte: Our what?

Ezra: Our retirement accounts. Remember last month we decided to start saving money for retirement?

Charlotte: Whose harebrained idea was that? Do you think we can get the money back?

Ezra: I’m not sure, but if we can, I have dibs!

[end of dialogue]

Ezra begins our dialogue by saying to Charlotte, “W ait a minute,” meaning stop. “What happened to the $500 in our joint account?” A  “joint (joint) account” is a bank account that two or more people share, which m eans that either person, if it’s a two-person account, can spend money from tha t bank account – or “withdraw money,” we would say.

Charlotte says, “I probably paid bills with it.” Ch arlotte says that she “probably paid bills” (bills) with this $500. “Bills” refer t o obligations that you have to give other people money. You may have a “telephone bill. ” The telephone company may send you a “bill” in the mail, a piece of paper  telling you how much money you have to pay them for your telephone service.

Charlotte says, “You know that our paychecks barely  cover our monthly expenses.” Your “paycheck” (paycheck) is money you get from your job every week or two weeks, perhaps every month, in exchange  for working at your job. The verb “to cover” here refers to the ability to p ay for something, to have enough money to pay for something. You have to have enough  money “to cover your rent” – that is, to pay for your rent.

If we say something “barely (barely) covers” your “ expenses,” what you have to pay to live, we mean you have enough but just enoug h. You may need $100 and you have $101. So, you barely have enough money. the money you have “barely covers” your monthly expenses. Again, “expe nses” just refers to money that you have to spend in order to live or in order  to do a certain thing.

Ezra says, “I know, but I was counting on that $500  to pay for new tires for my car.” Ezra understands that the paychecks that he a nd Charlotte get barely cover their monthly expenses, but he was “depending on,” or relying on – he says “counting on” – the $500 to buy new tires for his c ar. Charlotte says, “Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it” – meaning the way I see things, or in my opinion – “if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it

for some new shoes.” A “balance” (balance) refers t o an amount of money that is in, in this case, your bank account.

Charlotte is saying that if they have extra money i n their bank account, she has “dibs (dibs) on it.” “To have dibs on” something is  to have the right to have or to do something before another person. It’s a somewhat  informal expression often used in families, especially among children. Childr en will say, “I have dibs on that seat on the couch.” In other words, I am the person  who gets to use that seat on the couch before anyone else. Another way of using this word “dibs” is “to call dibs.” “I called dibs on the last piece of cake.” I n other words, that’s mine. No one else can have it.

Charlotte says she has dibs on any extra money in t heir bank account so she can buy some new shoes. Ezra disagrees. He says, “Forge t it. The tires are a necessity and your shoes are not.” A “necessity” is  something you need, something that is necessary or required. He says, “ We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spending for nonesse ntials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category.”

Ezra and Charlotte give themselves each $150 every month for “discretionary (discretionary) spending.” Spending that is “discre tionary” is something that you control and that is not affected by any other rules  or obligations. “Nonessentials” refers to things that are not essential. Something that is “essential” is something that is “necessary.” “Essential” and “necessity” he re are related. “Nonessentials” are things that are not required, not necessary.

Ezra is saying that new shoes are “nonessentials.” He says they “fall into the category of nonessentials.” “To fall into” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning that it has the characteristics of a particular group or  a particularly category. That’s why he says it “falls into” that category. It is to  be classified or it is to be described as being, in this case, nonessential. Cha rlotte says, “You don’t need to spend $500 for a set of new tires.” You don’t need to spend five hundred dollars for four new tires, Charlotte is saying. “You just want to splash the cash for some fancy,” or nice, “ones.”

The expression “to splash (splash) the cash (cash)”  means to spend money on something that causes other people to notice you, e specially when you’re buying things that are expensive but aren’t necessary. It’ s an informal expression, “to splash the cash.” If you go out and buy a new Merce des-Benz or a new BMW car or a new Rolls Royce even if you don’t need one – a nd after all, who really needs that expensive of a car – we might say that you are  “splashing the cash.”

Perhaps you want to try to get a new girlfriend or perhaps you want your neighbors to think that you are very rich.

Ezra says, “Let’s stop arguing about who gets to sp end the money and first figure out,” or determine, “what happened to it” – what ha ppened to the $500. “According to this” – and we imagine that Ezra is l ooking at their bank statement, a piece of paper describing everything that happene d in their bank account last month – “the money was withdrawn from our account f or automatic contributions to our retirement accounts.” “Withdrawn” comes from  the verb “to withdraw,” which means to take out of something.

When we’re talking about money and bank accounts, w e refer to “depositing money” – putting money in – and “withdrawing money, ” taking money out. The money was withdrawn from Ezra and Charlotte’s accou nt for “automatic contributions.” Something that is “automatic” (auto matic) is something that happens without you having to do anything or take a ny action yourself. A “contribution” is when you give money or something else to someone or to something.

In this case, we’re talking about putting money, or  we would use the verb “contributing” money, to a “retirement account.” “R etirement” (retirement) describes what happens after you stop working, usua lly after the age of, say, 65 or 67. That’s called “retirement.” You are no longe r working. But of course you still need money, and in the United States many peo ple have what are called “retirement accounts” that you put money into while  you are still working.

That money is then, we hope, invested in stocks or bonds or some other sort of financial instrument that allows you to make even m ore money with your money, so that when you stop working, you have money to li ve on. Yes, the government gives you money through a system we call “Social Se curity,” but often it isn’t very much.

So, this $500 that Charlotte and Ezra are talking a bout was actually taken or withdrawn from their account and put into their ret irement accounts. In many companies, this happens automatically. You decide h ow much money you want to put into your retirement account, and every mont h the company takes part of your paycheck and puts it into a retirement account . That’s what happens here at CED.

Charlotte says, “Our what?” She seems confused. Ezr a says, “Our retirement accounts. Remember last month we decided to start s aving money for retirement?” Charlotte says, “Who’s harebrained ide a was that?” “Harebrained”

(harebrained) means stupid, foolish, something that  was done without thinking about it very carefully. Charlotte is saying that h aving a retirement account is a “harebrained” idea.

She says, “Do you think we can get the money back?”  She’s asking if you can then get that money back from your retirement accou nt. By the way, the answer to that is usually no. The retirement accounts are often protected for tax reasons, and so you can’t just put money in and take it out whenever you want. You have to wait until you reach a certain age.

Charlotte wants to get the money back, however. Ezr a says, “I’m not sure,” meaning I’m not sure if we can get the money back, “but if we can, I have dibs!” Notice once again the use of that word “dibs,” mean ing Ezra gets to use the money if they can get it out of their retirement ac count – which as I mentioned, they probably can’t.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ezra: Wait a minute. What happened to the $500 in o ur joint account?

Charlotte: I probably paid bills with it. You know that our paychecks barely cover our monthly expenses.

Ezra: I know, but I was counting on that $500 to pa y for new tires for my car.

Charlotte: Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it, if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it for s ome new shoes.

Ezra: Forget it. The tires are a necessity and your  shoes are not. We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spe nding for nonessentials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category.

Charlotte: You don’t need to spend $500 for a set of new tires. You just want to splash the cash for some fancy ones.

Ezra: Let’s stop arguing about who gets to spend the money and first figure out what happened to it. According to this, the money w as withdrawn from our account for automatic contributions to our retireme nt accounts.

Ezra: I’m not sure, but if we can, I have dibs!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,238 – Making Accusations.

This episode is a dialogue between Pierre and Marie  about saying another person did something wrong. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pierre: What happened here?!

Marie: It looks like somebody trashed your experime nt.

Pierre: It’s ruined, completely ruined.

Marie: Who could have done this? Why are you lookin g at me like that?

Pierre: Very few people have access to this lab and  even fewer know which of these experiments is mine. Whoever did this knew ho w to do maximum damage.

Marie: And you’re accusing me? I helped you with th at experiment. I’d sooner ruin my own work than intentionally damage someone else’s, much less yours. What would be my motive?

Pierre: Maybe you gave me a little too much help an d now my work is outshining yours.

Marie: Your suspicions are completely unfounded. I’ ve never been jealous of any attention you’ve received. You’re totally off base.

Pierre: Maybe you’re right. I’m sorry. I just can’t  believe what’s happened.

Marie: I’d be upset, too, but let’s not do any more  finger-pointing. We need more information before we accuse or exonerate anyone. L et’s try to stay calm.

 Pierre: Yes, of course, you’re right. Hey, what hap pened to your workspace? It looks like it’s been tampered with.

Marie: What?! I’ll kill whoever did this! I’ll kill  them!

[end of dialogue]

Pierre begins our dialogue by asking Marie, “What h appened here?” Marie says, “It looks like somebody trashed your experiment.” “ To trash” (trash) means to damage or ruin or perhaps even destroy something. T he word “trash” as a noun means garbage or junk, but here as a verb it means to damage or physically harm something. It’s an informal verb used in this way. If a newspaper is describing a rock and roll band that damages the ho tel room where they’re staying, they might use this verb. “The members of the band trashed the hotel room.” In this case, someone trashed Pierre’s exper iment. An “experiment” is a scientific process used to test some hypothesis or theory.

Pierre says about his trashed experiment, “It’s rui ned.” “To ruin” (ruin) means to destroy, to damage something so much that you can no longer use it or it no longer has any value. We use this verb quite often in English both to talk about physical objects as well as chances or opportunitie s for the future. You could ruin something you’re cooking by putting too much salt i n it, or you could ruin your chances to get a job by going to an interview in a bikini, especially if you’re a man. “To ruin your chances” means that you have don e something to hurt or harm your chances – the possibility of you getting a job at that company.

Pierre’s experiment has been “completely ruined,” h e says. Marie says, “Who could have done this? Why are you looking at me lik e that?” We can imagine that Pierre is looking at Marie, thinking that it was Ma rie who trashed his experiment. Pierre replies, “Very few people have access to thi s lab.” “To have access” (access) means to be able to go into a certain plac e. A “lab” (lab) is a “laboratory,” a place where scientists work and do their experiments.

Pierre says, “Very few people have access to this l ab and even fewer know which of these experiments is mine. Whoever did thi s knew how to do maximum damage.” “Maximum” (maximum) means the highest or g reatest amount of something. The opposite of “maximum” is “minimum.” Pierre is saying that whoever damaged his experiment knew how to do the m aximum damage.

Marie then asks Pierre, “Are you accusing me?” “To accuse” (accuse) is to say that someone has done something wrong or perhaps ha s broken the law. The

noun “accusation” comes from the verb “to accuse.” So, Marie is asking Pierre if Pierre is saying that Marie did the damage – if he is accusing her. Marie says, “I helped you with that experiment. I’d sooner ruin my  own work than intentionally damage someone else’s.” That expression, “I’d” (I’d ) – standing for “I would” – “sooner” (sooner) is another way of saying “I would  rather do this than that.”

So in this case, Marie says, “I’d sooner ruin my ow n work than intentionally damage someone else’s.” In other words, she would r ather ruin her own work than hurt or damage someone else’s work. She uses t he adverb “intentionally” (intentionally). “Intentionally” means “on purpose”  – something you want to do and are trying to do. “I intentionally hit my young er brother when I was a child.” I did it on purpose. I wanted to do it. The opposite of “intentionally” would be “accidentally.” If you “accidentally” do something,  you didn’t want to do it but you did it anyway.

Going back then to this expression “I’d sooner do X  than Y,” it’s used to show just how much you did not want to do something or would not want to do something. Marie is saying that she is innocent. She didn’t do  anything wrong. In fact, she would prefer to damage or ruin her own work rather than damage Pierre’s work. That’s why she ends the sentence by saying “much le ss yours.” That phrase “much less” means that something is even less likel y or less acceptable than something already mentioned.

Marie then asks, “What would be my motive?” A “moti ve” (motive) is your reason or purpose for doing something. It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. We often use this word “motive” when we’re t alking about the reason why a criminal does something bad, does something wrong. Pierre says, “Maybe you gave me a little too much help and now my work is o utshining yours.” Pierre is explaining what he thinks Marie’s possible motive w as for ruining his experiment. It is that Marie helped Pierre so much that now his  work is “outshining” (outshining) her work. “To outshine” means to do be tter than another person, to be superior to what someone else has done.

Marie says, “Your suspicions are completely unfound ed.” “Suspicions” (suspicions) is a belief that something is true or might be true, even though you don’t have very much evidence or proof of that. Mar ie is saying that Pierre’s suspicions, his beliefs about her, are “completely unfounded” (unfounded). Something that is “unfounded” has no evidence or su pport or facts to show that it is true. Marie says, “I’ve never been jealous of an y attention you’ve received. You’re totally off base.” “To be jealous” (jealous)  is to have a strong feeling of wanting something that another person has or to be like what another person is.

Marie says she is not jealous of the attention or t he publicity that Pierre has received. She says he is totally “off base” (base).  “To be off base” means to be completely wrong, without any logic or reason. Pier re says, “Maybe you’re right. I’m sorry. I just can’t believe what’s happened.” T hen Marie says, “I’d be upset too,” meaning “If this happened to me, I would also  be mad.” She continues, “But let’s not do any more finger-pointing.” The term “f inger-pointing” means the same as blaming. “To blame” someone is to say that someo ne else is responsible for a bad situation or something bad that happened.

Marie says, “We need more information before we acc use or exonerate anyone. Let’s try to stay calm.” “To exonerate” (exonerate)  means to prove that someone didn’t do anything wrong, to prove that someone is innocent. “To accuse,” then, is to say someone did something wrong. “To exonerat e” is to prove that the person did not do anything wrong. Pierre agrees tha t they need to get more information. Then, however, he looks over at Marie’ s workspace, the place where she’s working. He says, “It looks like it’s been ta mpered with.” “To tamper (tamper) with” something is to interfere with somet hing, to do something that would cause damage to a process or an object.

In other words, Pierre notices that someone appears  to have ruined Marie’s work as well. Now remember, Marie just said that everyon e should stay calm, should not get too excited, but when she finds out that he r work has also been ruined, she then of course gets very angry. She says, “What ?! I’ll kill whoever did this! I’ll kill them!” She, of course, now is very angry, prom ising to kill whoever trashed her experiment.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pierre: What happened here?!

Marie: It looks like somebody trashed your experime nt.

Pierre: It’s ruined, completely ruined.

Marie: Who could have done this? Why are you lookin g at me like that?

Pierre: Very few people have access to this lab and  even fewer know which of these experiments is mine. Whoever did this knew ho w to do maximum damage.

Marie: And you’re accusing me? I helped you with th at experiment. I’d sooner ruin my own work than intentionally damage someone else’s, much less yours. What would be my motive?

Pierre: Maybe you gave me a little too much help an d now my work is outshining yours.

Marie: Your suspicions are completely unfounded. I’ ve never been jealous of any attention you’ve received. You’re totally off base.

Pierre: Maybe you’re right. I’m sorry. I just can’t  believe what’s happened.

Marie: I’d be upset, too, but let’s not do any more  finger-pointing. We need more information before we accuse or exonerate anyone. L et’s try to stay calm.

Pierre: Yes, of course, you’re right. Hey, what hap pened to your workspace? It looks like it’s been tampered with.

This episode is a dialogue between Sara and Gabriel  about having more than one person use your online account. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Sara: Hello, customer service. How may I help you t oday?

Gabriel: Hello. I noticed some suspicious activity on my account and I want to find out if there’s been unauthorized access.

Sara: Let’s take a look. Your account history shows  purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago.

Gabriel: That’s the problem. I haven’t made any pur chases.

Sara: Do you have a shared account, by any chance?

Gabriel: Yes, I have a household account that’s sha red by my entire family. My wife has full access, but my children only have res tricted access.

Sara: I’m afraid that’s not showing in your account  preferences. Both of your children have full access.

Gabriel: Even so, they know not to abuse their priv ileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first.

Sara: Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your c hildren have accessed the account regularly. In fact, they’re both logged on right now.

 Gabriel: They are? What are they doing?

Sara: They’re in the process of buying several more  items and are checking out.

Gabriel: Stop them! This is an emergency. Shut down  my account.

Sara: I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps you can stop them on your end.

Gabriel: I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I  get my hands on those two!

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking in this episode about sharing, or mor e than one person using, an online or internet account. An “account” is, in thi s case, permission to use a certain website, usually one that requires you regi ster – and often, pay – to use. Our dialogue begins with Sara saying, “Hello, custo mer service. How may I help you?” Sara, then, works for a company, an online co mpany. She is part of their “customer service” – the people who are supposed to  help you when you have a problem.

Gabriel says, “Hello. I noticed some suspicious act ivity on my account.” “Suspicious (suspicious) activity” is something, so me activity or action, that you don’t recognize or that you think might be a proble m. If you see someone standing by your car and looking as though he might  try to steal your car, that would be an example of “suspicious activity.” The p erson is standing there and you’re not quite sure why. You think there might be  some problem in the near future with this person.

In the case of Gabriel, he noticed some suspicious activity on his online account. He noticed things that he perhaps didn’t recognize or should not have been there. He wants to find out if there has been any “ unauthorized access.” “Access” (access) is the ability to get into somewhere. It c ould be a physical place, or in this case it could be an account on a website. “Una uthorized” (unauthorized) is “not authorized,” meaning you don’t have permission  to do that.

Sara says, “Let’s take a look. Your account history  shows purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago.” Your “account history ” would be a list on your website account of all the things that have happene d on your account – all the things, in this case, that you have purchased or bo ught. Gabriel says, “That’s the problem. I haven’t made any purchases.” Sara is say ing that there have been

purchases on Gabriel’s account every day for the pa st two weeks, but Gabriel is saying he hasn’t bought anything. He didn’t buy any thing from this website.

Sara then asks him, “Do you have a shared account, by any chance?” “To share” (share) is to use something with another person or to give something to another person to use as well. A “shared account” would be an account, in this case on a website, that two or more people could use. Sara ad ds the expression at the end of her question, “by any chance.” “By any chance” i s a polite way of asking if something is possible. We might also say “maybe” or  “perhaps.” “Do you by any chance have a pen I can borrow?” You are politely a sking someone if they have a pen that you could use.

Gabriel says, in answer to Sara’s question, “Yes, I  have a household account that’s shared by my entire family.” “Household” (ho usehold) refers to the group of people who live in your house or in your home. Usua lly all of those people are members of your family – a father, a mother, childr en, perhaps a grandmother, or even an aunt and an uncle. Those are all part of a “household” – people who live in one house or one apartment. Gabriel says he has a “household account” and every member of his family has access to this accou nt.

He says, “My wife has full access but my children o nly have restricted access.” Gabriel talks about two kinds of access. The first kind is “full” (full). If you have “full access” to something, you have complete acces s. You have just as much access as the person who owns the account. Gabriel says his wife has “full access,” the same access that Gabriel has, but his children only have “restricted (restricted) access.” “Restricted” means that you a ren’t able to do everything someone with full access can do. “Restricted” means  partial, or just a part of the larger or whole amount.

Sara says, “I’m afraid that’s not showing in your a ccount preferences.” Sara, the customer service woman, is telling Gabriel that his  account is not set up – his account is not, we might say, “configured” – for re stricted access for his children. Your “account preferences” are the things that you can turn on and off or change about your account. Sara then tells Gabriel, “Both of your children have full access.”

Gabriel says, “Even so” – meaning “Well, okay, even  if that were true” – “they,” meaning his two children, “know not to abuse their privileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first.” Gabriel  is saying that even though his children have full access to his account, they woul d not “abuse” (abuse) their privileges. “To abuse” something is to use somethin g in a harmful way – either

doing too much of something or doing it in a way th at could hurt you or someone else.

“To abuse someone’s privileges” (privileges) is to use the authorization or right to do something in a wrong way. “Privileges” refer to things that you are able to do, in this case. So, “to abuse your privileges” would be to use the things that you can use in a way you should not use them. In this c ase, Gabriel is saying his children would not buy something from this online a ccount without asking him or his wife.

Sara says, “Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your children have access to the account regularly,” meaning “frequently.” “In f act, they’re both logged on right now.” “To be logged (logged) on” means to be regist ered and using a website at a certain point, at a certain time. If you are “log ged on to your account,” you have signed in. You have logged in with your username an d password and are using a certain website.

Sara is saying that Gabriel’s two children are usin g this website right now. Gabriel says, “They are? What are they doing?” Sara  says, “They’re in the process of” – meaning “they are right now” – “buyin g several more items,” several more things, “and are checking out.” “To ch eck (check) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to complete your purchase of s omething.

Normally on a website, when you buy something, you say you want to buy it by adding it to a “shopping cart.” This is sort of a p age where what you want to buy is being kept. Then you “check out.” Then you say, “Okay, I want to buy it,” and you put in your credit card information and you say , “Yes, I want to buy it.” “To check out,” then, means to complete your purchase of something, to buy something by giving a website your payment informat ion – your credit card number or perhaps your PayPal account information.

Gabriel tells Sara to stop his children from checki ng out. “This is an emergency,” he says. “Shut down my account.” The phrasal verb “ to shut (shut) down” means to close something so that it no longer functions o r no longer works. If the owner of a company “shuts down” his business, he closes h is business. The business stops functioning. Gabriel wants Sara to shut down his online account. But Sara says, “I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps, yo u can stop them on your end.” “On your end” means where you are, at your location .

Gabriel says, “I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I get my hands on those two!” Gabriel is obviously angry. He’s upset. He says, “I ’ll stop them,” meaning his two children, “all right.” The expression “all (all) ri ght (right)” means certainly, for sure,

without any doubt. Here it’s meant to indicate just  how certain – and in a way, angry – Gabriel is. “I’ll stop them all right,” mea ning I will definitely stop them. I am certainly going to stop them. Notice that “all r ight” is two words. It’s often spelled nowadays as one word, (alright), but the mo re traditional spelling is (all) and then (right) as two words.

Gabriel then ends our dialogue by saying, “Just wai t till I get my hands on those two.” “Wait till” (‘til) means “wait until.” “‘Till ” is just a short way of saying “until.” “Wait until I get my hands on” someone means I am v ery angry and I’m going to hurt someone for doing something wrong. I’m going t o punish someone for doing something wrong. It might be something a parent wou ld say about his or her child if the child has done something wrong.

That’s the case here. Gabriel is very angry at his two children. We don’t know if he’s actually going to hurt them physically, but ce rtainly he is going to punish them. He is going to do something to discipline the m for buying things on this website without his permission.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sara: Hello, customer service. How may I help you t oday?

Gabriel: Hello. I noticed some suspicious activity on my account and I want to find out if there’s been unauthorized access.

Sara: Let’s take a look. Your account history shows  purchases nearly every day beginning two weeks ago.

Gabriel: That’s the problem. I haven’t made any pur chases.

Sara: Do you have a shared account, by any chance?

Gabriel: Yes, I have a household account that’s sha red by my entire family. My wife has full access, but my children only have res tricted access.

Sara: I’m afraid that’s not showing in your account  preferences. Both of your children have full access.

Gabriel: Even so, they know not to abuse their priv ileges. They wouldn’t buy things without asking my wife or me first.

 Sara: Are you sure, sir? I show that both of your c hildren have accessed the account regularly. In fact, they’re both logged on right now.

Gabriel: They are? What are they doing?

Sara: They’re in the process of buying several more  items and are checking out.

Gabriel: Stop them! This is an emergency. Shut down  my account.

Sara: I’m not sure I can do that, sir. Perhaps you can stop them on your end.

Gabriel: I’ll stop them all right. Just wait till I  get my hands on those two!

This episode is a dialogue between Evelyn and Hank about giving someone the correct amount of money back when he pays you in ca sh. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Evelyn: If you want a job here as a cashier, you’ll  need to be able to give correct change.

Hank: Don’t you use a cash register here?

Evelyn: We do, but when it’s not working, we have t o be able to calculate change in our heads in a pinch.

Hank: Oh, I didn’t realize that.

Evelyn: Okay, let’s see how you do with a simple sa le. Let’s say I’m purchasing these two items and I’m paying with a $20 bill.

Hank: All right, give me a minute . . . the total i s $9.36.

Evelyn: Make sure you count back the change.

Hank: I’ve never done that before. I’m not sure I k now how.

Evelyn: Count up starting with the coins and workin g your way up to the paper money. Count out loud so the customer gets a runnin g total.

Hank: Okay, but first I have to do the math. The ch ange should be . . . Can I have a piece of paper to check my work? I don’t want to short the customer or give them too much change.

Evelyn: You won’t have time to do that with each cu stomer. Math wasn’t your favorite subject in school, was it?

Hank: You’re right about that. Maybe I need to work  on my math skills. In the meantime, I’m handy with a mop.

Evelyn: Good to hear. There’s a cleanup on aisle th ree that’s got your name all over it.

[end of dialogue]

Evelyn begins our dialogue by saying to Hank, “If y ou want a job here as a cashier, you’ll need to be able to give correct cha nge.” A “cashier” (cashier) is a person whose job it is to take your money at a stor e where you are buying something. Now, you can pay for things in most Amer ican stores using a credit card, but many people buy things, especially things  that don’t cost very much money, in cash – that is, they pay for their items,  the things they are buying, with paper money and coins.

“To give correct change” means to, as a cashier, gi ve the correct amount of money back to someone who pays you with more money than what the item is worth. An example will make this clear. If you are buying a large coffee cup, like the ones that I use, and the cup costs $5.50, you m ay give the cashier $10 to pay for this coffee cup. The cashier then gives you bac k money. The correct change in this case would be $4.50, because $10 minus $5.5 0 (the cost of the cup) is $4.50. We call that amount of money you get back “c hange” (change).

So, Evelyn is telling Hank that he has to learn how  to give correct change. Hank asks, “Don’t you use a cash register here?” A “cash  register” (register) is a machine, nowadays usually a computer, that adds up the cost of everything a customer or a person buying something is buying and  tells you what the total amount is. A cash register will often usually tell you how much change to give back to a customer if the customer is paying with c ash. Notice that we call it a “cash register,” but it is used for people paying w ith credit cards as well as with cash.

Evelyn says, “We do,” meaning we do use a cash regi ster here, “but when it’s not working” – when it is not functioning properly – “w e have to be able to calculate

change in our heads in a pinch.” “To calculate” (ca lculate) means to perform a mathematical function with numbers, such as adding,  subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. “To do something in your head” means to d o it without writing anything down on a piece of paper or using a computer or oth er machine.

Most of us can add five plus five in our heads. We don’t need a piece of paper to calculate the answer, or at least I hope we don’t. “To do something in a pinch” (pinch) means to do something if it’s necessary in a difficult or challenging situation, meaning you wouldn’t normally have to do  it that way, but if it were required, you could do it that way. Hank responds, “Oh, I didn’t realize that,” meaning, I guess, he didn’t realize that sometimes the cash register doesn’t work.

Evelyn says, “Okay, let’s see how you do,” meaning let’s see how you perform, how you are able to give change back, “with a simpl e sale. Let’s say,” meaning let’s imagine, “I’m purchasing,” or buying, “these two items” – these two things – “and I’m paying with a $20 bill.” Hanks says, “All right, give me a minute,” meaning give me some time, a short amount of time t o think about it. Hank then says, “The total is $9.36.” “The total” means that’ s how much the two items that Evelyn has there cost together. Evelyn says, “Make sure you count back the change.” “To count back the change” means to say ou t loud, as you are giving the money back to the customer, how much that chang e is.

So, if a customer buys something for $9.36 and give s you a $20 bill, you count back the change by starting with the amount that the customer purchased, and each coin or each piece of currency – cash – you gi ve the customer, you say it out loud. So, if the customer buys something worth $9.36, you would first give the customer four pennies. You would go “Nine thirty-si x, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty,” then you would give the custom er a dime, worth 10 cents: “$9.50.”

Then you would give the customer two quarters, wort h 50 cents, and then you would say “Ten,” and then you would give the custom er a $10 bill and you would say “Twenty.” So, the total is $9.36, and you would  say, “Nine thirty-seven, thirty- eight, thirty-nine, forty, fifty, ten, and twenty.”  You are counting back the change to the customer. I worked in a store as a cashier f or seven years when I was in high school and college, so I got used to counting back change to the customer.

Hank says, “I’ve never done that before. I’m not su re I know how.” Evelyn says, “Count up starting with the coins and working your way up to the paper money. “To count up” means to start with the smallest numb er and gradually or slowly add to it. That’s what I did in my example. I “coun ted up” beginning with the total

of the sale, $9.36. First I gave the customer back the coins. A “coin” (coin) is a small, in the United States, round piece of metal t hat represents a certain amount of money.

In the U.S., we have the smallest coin, which is a penny. That’s worth 1 cent out of the 100 cents in a dollar. We also have a “nicke l” (nickel), worth 5 cents, a “dime” (dime), worth 10 cents, a “quarter” (quarter ), worth 25 cents. We do have a “50-cent coin,” but it’s not used very often. We also have a dollar coin, but again, it’s not used very often. In fact, I don’t t hink they make dollar coins anymore.

So, Evelyn tells Hank to “count up starting with the coins” and to work his way up, meaning to get up to a higher amount – in this case  to the paper money, what are called “paper bills” (bills). In the U.S., the most common paper bills you will see are $1 bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, and $20 bill s, although you will also see $50 bills and $100 bills.

Evelyn says, “Count out loud,” meaning so the perso n can hear you, “so the customer gets a running total.” A “running total” i s a total amount each time you add a new amount to what you are giving the custome r, just as I did when I gave my example of $9.37, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, for ty. That’s a running total. Hank says, “Okay, but first I have to do the math.” “To do the math” means the same as to calculate.

Hank says, “The change should be,” and then he stop s and says, “Can I have a piece of paper to check my work?” Hank wants a piec e of paper and a pencil or a pen to calculate on the piece of paper rather than doing it in his head. He says, “I don’t want to short the customer or give them” – hi m or her – “too much change.” “To short” (short) means to give the customer less money than you are supposed to give him. Of course you don’t want to short the customer. The customer might get very angry.

Evelyn says, “You won’t have time to do that with e ach customer,” meaning you’re not going to have time to take out a piece of paper and calculate the change every time you have a customer. “Math wasn’t  your favorite subject in school, was it?” Evelyn asks. She’s making a joke. She’s saying that Hank isn’t very good at math, at mathematics. In British Engli sh they would say “maths” with an “s” on the end, but in U.S. English, we just say  “math” without the “s.” Hank says, “You’re right about that,” meaning no, math w asn’t my favorite subject in school.

He says, “Maybe I need to work on” – or to practice , to get better – “on my math skills. In the meantime, I’m handy with a mop.” “To  be handy” (handy) means to be able to do something well, especially some physi cal task. A “mop” (mop) is something you use to wash the floor. It has a long stick, and on the end of the stick there is either a sponge or a group of thick ropes that are used to clean the floor with water and some kind of soap. Hank is mak ing a little joke here. He’s saying that because he isn’t very good at math, may be he can do something else at that store. Maybe he can clean the floors.

Evelyn says, “Good to hear,” meaning that’s good to  know, that information is good for me to know. Then she says, “There’s a clea nup on aisle three that’s got your name all over it.” A “cleanup” (cleanup) – one  word – is a noun referring to something that needs to be cleaned up, that needs t o be picked up, usually because someone dropped it. If you go into a grocer y store, a place that sells food, sometimes people drop the containers of food on the floor and someone has to clean that up. That’s a “cleanup.”

An “aisle” (aisle) in this case refers to the area between the rows of food in a grocery store. Most grocery stores put cans and pac kages of food that don’t need to be in a refrigerator or freezer on shelves, and these shelves are placed in the store. In between the shelves is what is called an “aisle.” That’s where you can walk up and down in order to see the food on the sh elves. Evelyn says that there’s a “cleanup in aisle three,” meaning the thi rd aisle in the grocery store.

She says the cleanup has Hank’s name “all over it.”  To have your name “all over” something or “written all over” something means tha t it is something that is a good match for you, something that is intended for you. Evelyn is saying, in other words, that Hank would be a good person to clean up  the mess in aisle three, especially since he isn’t very good at math and the refore will not be a very good cashier.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Evelyn: If you want a job here as a cashier, you’ll  need to be able to give correct change.

Hank: Don’t you use a cash register here?

This episode is a dialogue between Elizabeth and Si dney about breaking your arm or your leg – sounds painful. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Elizabeth: We need to get you to the hospital right  now!

Sidney: I took a tumble, that’s all. It’s nothing –  just a little pain in my elbow and leg.

Elizabeth: Your arm is twisted in an odd angle and you’re limping. You could have broken bones.

Sidney: In the past, I’ve had a compound fracture i n my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more  than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.

Elizabeth: Look how your arm is swelling up. It alm ost looks deformed. And you still can’t put weight on your leg.

Sidney: The last thing I need right now is to get a  splint or a cast. I have to get to work.

Elizabeth: You can’t work in the shape you’re in. W hy don’t you let me take you to the emergency room to get treated?

Sidney: I’ll just take a couple of painkillers and walk it off.

Elizabeth: You mean limp it off. Well, in the end, it’s your arm, it’s your leg, and it’s your funeral!

[end of dialogue]

Elizabeth begins our dialogue by shouting or yellin g, “We need to get you to the hospital right now!” Sidney says, however, “I took a tumble, that’s all.” Elizabeth thinks that Sidney needs to go to the hospital imme diately but Sidney doesn’t agree. He says he “just took a tumble” (tumble). “T o take a tumble” is another way of saying “to fall down” – to go from standing to being on the ground accidentally.

Sidney says, “It’s nothing – just a little pain in my elbow and leg.” Your “elbow” (elbow) is that part of your arm that connects the top part of your arm to the bottom part of your arm – your “upper arm,” we woul d call it – to your lower arm. Elizabeth says, “Your arm is twisted in an odd angl e and you’re limping.” “To be twisted” (twisted) means to have two parts of somet hing turned in opposite directions. In this case, I suppose it would mean t hat one part of your arm is not in the direction it should be. It’s twisted.

Elizabeth says the arm is “twisted in an odd,” or u nusual or strange, “angle” (angle). An “angle” is technically the number of de grees between two straight lines. So, the corner of a room is a, usually, 90-d egree angle. There are 360 degrees in a circle. If you have a square room or a  rectangular room, the corners of the room have 90-degree angles. Elizabeth says t he arm “is twisted in an odd angle” – an angle it should not be at. “And,” she s ays, “you’re limping.” “To limp” (limp) means to walk in an uneven way so that you a re putting more of your weight on one leg versus the other.

Elizabeth says, “You could have broken bones” (bone s). Your “bones,” of course, are those hard substances in your body that support  your body. All the bones in your body make up what’s called your “skeleton” (sk eleton). You have bones in your arms. You have bones in your legs. You have bo nes in your ears, even. Sidney says, “In the past, I’ve had a compound frac ture in my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more  than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.”

Sidney is saying that he has broken his bones befor e, and when that happened, it caused a lot more pain than what he is experienc ing right now, and therefore he thinks he has not broken any bones. He mentions a “compound (compound) fracture (fracture).” A “fracture” is when there is  a break in the bone – when the bone is broken. A “compound fracture” is when the b one is broken into one or

more pieces and often the bone comes out through the skin. I know, it sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? Well, it is.

Apparently Sidney had a compound fracture in his an kle. Your “ankle” (ankle) is that part of your foot that connects the foot to the lower leg. Sidney also had a “stress (stress) fracture” in his “wrist” (wrist). Your “wrist” connects your hand to your lower arm. A “stress fracture” is less serious  than a compound fracture. It’s basically a crack or a line in the bone that is oft en caused by using the bone in a certain way over time that causes it to form a smal l crack or line.

Elizabeth says, “Look how your arm is swelling up.”  “To swell” (swell) means to get bigger, to get larger. The verb, the phrasal ve rb, “to swell up” means for a part of your body to become very large, usually bec ause you have hurt it. Your body naturally tries to protect parts that have bee n hurt, and one consequence, one result of, say, breaking a bone may be that the  parts around the bone swell up.

Elizabeth says that his arm, Sidney’s arm, “looks d eformed.” “Deformed” (deformed) means not having a normal shape, especia lly when we’re talking about some part of the human body. Elizabeth says, “And you still can’t put weight on your leg.” “To put weight (weight) on you r leg” means to walk or stand as you would normally, so that part of the weight of your body is being supported by your leg or legs.

Sidney says, “The last thing I need right now,” mea ning something that I definitely do not want, “is to get a splint or a ca st.” When you hurt your arm, especially if you break your arm or your leg, you m ay get a “splint” (splint). A splint is usually made with one or two hard objects  that cannot bend that are placed next to or around a broken bone so that you don’t or can’t move your arm and leg and damage or hurt your arm or leg even mor e.

A “cast” (cast) has a similar function or purpose. A “cast” is when the doctor puts an object that surrounds your arm or your leg – usu ally it’s made nowadays of a special material called “fiberglass,” though it use d to be made more commonly with something called “plaster” (plaster). If you b reak an arm or a leg, you will often have the arm or leg put in a cast so you don’ t move it, to give your body time to “heal” (heal). “To heal” means to get bette r, to recover. Sidney doesn’t want a splint or a cast because he has to get to wo rk.

Elizabeth says, “You can’t work in the shape you’re  in.” “Shape” (shape) here refers not to the form or look of something, but ra ther to the health or physical condition of the body. Elizabeth says, “Why don’t y ou let me take you to the

emergency room to get treated?” The “emergency room ” is a special place in a hospital where you go when there is something wrong  with you that needs to be taken care of immediately. So, if you fall down and  break your leg, the first place you will go to is the emergency room of a hospital so that the doctors can help you.

An “emergency room” is sometimes called by its init ials: the “ER.” “To get treated” (treated) means to get help from a doctor or a nurse. Sidney says, “I’ll just take a couple of painkillers and walk it off.”  Sidney doesn’t want to go to the hospital. He just wants to “take,” or swallow, “a c ouple of painkillers.” “Painkillers” are pills usually that you take, that you swallow, that help you with the pain that you are experiencing. It’s a pretty logical name for the drug, “painkiller.” It kills, or stops, the pain.

Sidney says he just wants “to walk it off.” “To wal k it off” means to use your legs even though they are in pain. We use this expressio n when you hurt your legs in some way but it isn’t serious. Athletes, for exampl e, will sometimes hurt their legs during a game but they don’t stop and go to a hospi tal. They just walk around a little until it feels better, until the pain dies d own or goes away. Elizabeth then says to Sidney, “You mean limp it off,” meaning he isn’t just going to walk it off – he’s going to have to limp because his leg is hurt so badly.

“Well,” she says, “in the end” – meaning if we exam ine the situation and try to come to a conclusion – “it’s your arm, it’s your le g, and it’s your funeral.” The expression “It’s your funeral” (funeral) is used to  tell someone that he or she is responsible for the bad things that will happen bec ause of his or her bad decisions. A “funeral” is a ceremony, an event you have when someone dies.

Elizabeth is making a joke here. That expression – “It’s your funeral” – is said somewhat jokingly to someone who we think is making  a bad decision. We’re saying well, you’re making this bad decision, but y ou are the one who is going to suffer the consequences. You are the one who will b e hurt by your bad decision, including perhaps even dying. That’s why Elizabeth says, “It’s your arm, it’s your leg, and it’s your funeral.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Elizabeth: We need to get you to the hospital right  now!

Sidney: I took a tumble, that’s all. It’s nothing –  just a little pain in my elbow and leg.

Elizabeth: Your arm is twisted in an odd angle and you’re limping. You could have broken bones.

Sidney: In the past, I’ve had a compound fracture i n my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more  than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.

Elizabeth: Look how your arm is swelling up. It alm ost looks deformed. And you still can’t put weight on your leg.

# Having Difficulty Reaching a Group Decision

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,242 – Having Difficulty Reaching a Group Decision.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,242. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Derrick and Liz about having to agree with other people. It’s not easy, as we’ll learn. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Derrick: That does it. I give up!

Liz: Don’t lose heart. We’ll come to a consensus so oner or later.

Derrick: No, we won’t. We’re hopelessly deadlocked.

Liz: It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we  only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.

Derrick: The trouble is, everybody seems to have ma de up their minds and they’re beginning to dig in their heels.

Liz: Before they do, let’s take one more vote. Mayb e somebody has changed their mind.

Derrick: I doubt it. Nobody wants to be outvoted so  both sides are trying to maintain the status quo. They’d rather be deadlocke d than on the losing side.

Liz: But if we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll have  to come back tomorrow and continue our discussions and deliberations.

Derrick: You’re right! I can’t spend another day in  this room. I’ve held out long enough.

Liz: What do you mean?

Derrick: The only way I’m getting out of here is to  change sides!

[end of dialogue]

Derrick begins our dialogue by saying to Liz, “That  does it. I give up!” The expression “That does (does) it” is used when you a re angry and frustrated and you don’t want to put up with, or accept, or tolera te something any longer. If your neighbor’s dog is barking, making a lot of noise, y ou may decide after an hour that you don’t want to tolerate or accept that nois e any more. So you say, “That does it. I’m going over to my neighbor’s house to t ell the owner of that dog to keep him quiet.”

Derrick says, “That does it. I give up!” The phrasa l verb “to give up” means to stop trying to do something, usually because it is too difficult. Liz, however, says, “Don’t lose heart.” “To lose (lose) heart (heart)” means to begin to think that something is impossible and that you should stop tr ying, in effect, that you should give up. “To lose heart” means, we could also say, “to be discouraged” – to feel as though you will not succeed at something.

Liz is telling Derrick not to give up, not to lose heart. “To lose heart” is a psychological or mental condition, if you will. “To  give up” is an action – to stop doing something. “To lose heart” is to become disco uraged, to think that you will not be successful. Liz says, “We’ll come to a conse nsus sooner or later.” A “consensus” (consensus) means an agreement, a situa tion in which most people in a group agree on something. So, obviously the si tuation here is that Derrick and Liz are in a meeting and not everyone agrees on  what to do.

Liz thinks that the people in the meeting will even tually “come to a consensus.” Notice the use of the verb “to come to” a consensus . We might also say “to reach” a consensus. Derrick says, “No, we won’t. We ’re hopelessly deadlocked.” “To be deadlocked” (deadlocked) means when people h ave very strong opinions on two sides of an issue – I think one thing, you t hink another – and they can’t agree on something. They can’t come to an agreement .

This happens sometimes with the government and gove rnment unions, or a big business and the workers for that business. They ma y become “deadlocked.” “To be hopelessly (hopelessly) deadlocked” means you ha ve no chance of agreeing. “Hopelessly” means that there is no hope. There is no possibility of changing the situation.

Liz says, “It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.” “To be evenly split” (split) means that you

have the same number on both sides of the issue or argument. So, if you have a group of six people, three people say one thing, th ree people say something else. They’re evenly split. “To change your mind” ( mind) means to change your opinion – to say, “Well, I think I was wrong. I thi nk this is correct instead.”

Liz thinks only one person has to change his or her  mind in order “to break the tie.” A “tie” (tie) is the same as being evenly spl it – when in a group you have the same number of people saying yes and no. “To break (break) a tie” means that you are no longer evenly split. One person may chan ge his mind and that would break the tie. There would be, that is, a “majority ” – more than 50 percent of people who say one thing.

Derrick doesn’t agree. He says, “The trouble is,” m eaning the problem here is, “everybody seems to have made up their minds and th ey’re beginning to dig in their heels.” There are two important expressions i n that sentence. The first one is “to make up your mind.” “To make up your mind” m eans to reach a decision after having thought about something for a while. “ To make up your mind” also usually means that you are certain about something,  meaning you probably won’t change your mind in the future.

That’s why Derrick uses the second expression, “to dig (dig) in your heels (heels).” “To dig” as a verb usually means to take something and put it in the ground in order to remove dirt or some other substa nce. We use a “shovel” (shovel) to dig a hole in the ground. You move the dirt from one place so that you have a hole, a depression, a space that goes down i n the ground. That’s “to dig.”

Your “heels” are the back part of your feet. If you  are wearing shoes, the “heels” of the shoes are the back parts of the shoes that a re on the ground underneath the back part of your foot, which we call the “heel .” So, if we put these two things together, “to dig in your heels” means literally to  take the backs of your feet and to create a small hole in the ground with them. How ever, we use this expression as a way of saying “to be very stubborn” – to refus e to change your opinion, to refuse to change your mind.

You can sort of see the connection. If you are, for  example, pulling on a rope and one person is pulling in one direction and you’re p ulling in the opposite direction, you would naturally try to use your heels to dig in  the ground to prevent your body from moving forward. That is more or less what  the meaning of this expression is. It means to be stubborn, not to chan ge your mind.

Liz says, however, that before people begin to dig in their heels, she wants to “take one more vote” (vote). “To vote” is when peop le indicate how they think

about a certain matter or what their opinion is abo ut a certain issue. She says, “Maybe somebody has changed their mind” – that is, maybe someone has changed his or her mind. Derrick says, “I doubt it. ” He doesn’t think anyone has changed his mind.

He says, “Nobody wants to be outvoted.” “To be outv oted” (outvoted) is to lose a vote because one side has more votes than you do. D errick thinks nobody wants to be outvoted, “so both sides,” both groups of peo ple, “are trying to maintain the status quo.” The “status (status) quo (quo)” refers  to the way things are now. “Status quo” is a Latin expression, and it refers t o the current situation, the way things are right now without changing anything.

Derrick thinks people “are trying to maintain the s tatus quo,” meaning they don’t want to change anything. He says instead “they’d ra ther be deadlocked than on the losing side.” In other words, they would rather  not have an agreement than lose the vote, than to be on the losing side – the losing group, if you will – in the vote.

Liz says, “But if we don’t reach an agreement” – if  we don’t come to a consensus – “we’ll have to come back,” or return, “tomorrow a nd continue our discussions and deliberations.” “Deliberations” (deliberation) means usually a careful, slow, detailed consideration of something. We talk about a group of people who are deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent of a  crime – we call that group a “jury” (jury) – “deliberating” – that is, they’re m aking their decision carefully and slowly and by thinking and talking a lot about it.

Derrick says, “You’re right! I can’t spend another day in this room. I’ve held out long enough.” “To hold out” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to continue to hold your position or to continue to have a certain  opinion even when the situation is difficult or the situation is dangerou s. “To hold out” means to stay where you are or to keep your opinion even though it is difficult.

Derrick says, “I’ve held out long enough.” Liz says , “What do you mean?” Derrick says, “The only way I’m getting out of here is to c hange sides!” “To change sides” (sides) means to change your opinion and join the o ther group – in this case, to join the group with whom you previously disagreed. So, Derrick is going to change his mind and change his vote so that the gro up is no longer deadlocked, so that they reach a consensus.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Derrick: That does it. I give up!

Liz: Don’t lose heart. We’ll come to a consensus so oner or later.

Derrick: No, we won’t. We’re hopelessly deadlocked.

Liz: It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we  only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.

Derrick: The trouble is, everybody seems to have ma de up their minds and they’re beginning to dig in their heels.

Liz: Before they do, let’s take one more vote. Mayb e somebody has changed their mind.

Derrick: I doubt it. Nobody wants to be outvoted so  both sides are trying to maintain the status quo. They’d rather be deadlocke d than on the losing side.

Liz: But if we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll have  to come back tomorrow and continue our discussions and deliberations.

Derrick: You’re right! I can’t spend another day in  this room. I’ve held out long enough.

Liz: What do you mean?

Derrick: The only way I’m getting out of here is to  change sides!

# Getting an Anesthetic

Welcome to English as a Second Language podcast num ber 1,243 – Getting an Anesthetic.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,243. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The Learning Guide gives you a complete transcript of everything we say, along with a complete glossary that has vocabulary words,  definitions, sample sentences, and much more.

This episode is about going to a hospital and getti ng a special kind of drug so that you don’t feel any pain. I want that. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Nurse: I’m here to prep you for your procedure. Did  the doctor already talk to you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?

Bruce: I don’t need a general anesthetic. I want to  be conscious during the procedure.

Nurse: You’ll be inhaling a general anesthetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant. That’s standard for this procedure.

Bruce: I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need i s a local anesthetic to numb the area.

Nurse: You’ll need something stronger. You don’t wa nt to feel any sensation or pain during the procedure.

Bruce: I’m not afraid of a little pain. Bring it on !

Nurse: Anyway, the general anesthetic will wear off  soon after the procedure. However, the doctor will keep you under sedation for the rest of the day so you can rest.

Bruce: Forget it. When it’s done, I’m going home. I ’m not staying here overnight.

 Nurse: That’s not advisable. You need to remain und er observation for 24 hours.

Bruce: That’s for other people. I’m tough. I’ll be up and ready to go. What’s that needle for?

Nurse: It’s to give you a shot before your procedur e.

Bruce: [whimpers] I don’t like needles. Get that aw ay from me!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with a nurse saying to Bruce, “ I’m here to prep you for your procedure.” “To prep” (prep) means “to prepare.” “P rep” comes from the verb “prepare.” It’s a short form of that verb. “To prep ” means to make someone ready for something – in this case, the nurse is prepping  Bruce for his “procedure,” something that the doctor is going to do to him.

She then asks Bruce, “Did the doctor already talk t o you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?” An “anesthetic” (ane sthetic) is medicine that is given to you to prevent you from feeling pain. A “g eneral anesthetic,” however, is medicine that usually makes you unconscious. This i s something that is used, for example, when you are going to have what is referre d to as a “major,” or important, “surgery” (surgery). A “surgery” is when  a doctor goes inside of your body, cuts into your body, to do something we hope that will make you better.

So, a “general anesthetic” is something that usuall y puts you to sleep. This is compared to a “local (local) anesthetic,” which jus t makes certain parts of your body no longer feel anything so that the doctor can  work on a certain part of your body without putting you completely to sleep. Bruce  says that he doesn’t want a general anesthetic. He wants “to be conscious (cons cious) during the procedure.” “To be conscious” is to be awake. It’s the opposite  of “to be unconscious,” which is to be basically asleep.

Don’t confuse the word “conscious” with a similar s ounding word, “conscience” (conscience). “Conscience” refers to your feelings of right and wrong. “Conscious” refers to being awake.

The nurse says, “You’ll be inhaling a general anest hetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant.” “To inhale” (inhale) means to breathe in, to bring in air or something else into your body, specifically into your “lungs” (lungs). Your “lungs” are what you use to breathe. Former preside nt Bill Clinton famously said,

when asked if he had ever smoked marijuana, that ye s, he had, but he “didn’t inhale” – that is, he didn’t put the marijuana smok e into his lungs. We love politicians.

Anyway, the nurse says that Bruce is going to be in haling a certain kind of gas which is a general anesthetic and getting an “intra venous muscle relaxant.” “Intravenous” (intravenous) refers to something going through your veins, which is a part of your body that carries blood. “Muscles ,” of course, are those parts of your body that move your body parts, your bones, ba ck and forth. A “relaxant” (relaxant) is something that relaxes you, make your  muscles loose and, we would say, “limp” (limp), which is the opposite of “firm. ”

So an “intravenous muscle relaxant” is basically an  injection – that is, something that is put into your body with something called a “needle” (needle). A “needle” is a small thin metal tube, basically, that goes into your skin so that drugs can be put into your body.

The nurse is going to give Bruce a general anesthet ic, which he will breathe in to his lungs, as well as what we would call simply a “ shot” (shot), which is taking a needle and putting something into your body.

Bruce says, “I’m not a wimp.” A “wimp” (wimp) is a weak person who is not brave, who is not courageous, who is afraid of pain . Bruce says, “I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need is a local anesthetic to  numb the area.” We explained “local anesthetic” as being a drug that prevents pa in in a certain part of your body. The verb “to numb” (numb) means to cause you to lose feeling in a certain part of your body. If you lose feeling, you won’t f eel pain there. That’s the purpose of a “local anesthetic.”

When you go to the dentist who works on your teeth,  the dentist will often give you a “local anesthetic” to numb the parts of your mouth where the dentist will be working. The nurse says, however, that Bruce needs something stronger. “You don’t want to feel any sensation or pain during the  procedure,” she says. “Sensation” (sensation) here means feeling somethin g that you can feel when someone touches you – that’s a “sensation,” or at l east one possibility of a sensation.

Bruce says, “I’m not afraid of a little pain. Bring  it on!” That phrase “Bring it on” is used to show that you are ready for some problem or  difficult situation or challenge. The nurse says, “Anyway, the general ane sthetic will wear off soon after the procedure.” She’s explaining to Bruce tha t after the doctor has finished

with his procedure, whatever it is, the general ane sthetic “will wear off.” “To wear (wear) off” means to slowly, gradually, lose streng th or effectiveness.

If you take a pill, if you swallow a pill that has medicine, eventually the medicine will probably “wear off,” meaning it will no longer  be effective, perhaps two hours or five hours from when you take it. The nurse expl ains that the doctor will keep him “under sedation for the rest of the day.” “Seda tion” (sedation) is when you are given drugs that don’t necessarily make you fal l asleep but make you very calm, make you very relaxed.

Bruce says, however, “Forget it,” meaning no, I don ’t want that. “When it’s done,” meaning when the procedure is finished, “I’m going home. I’m not staying here overnight,” meaning he doesn’t want to sleep at the  hospital until the next day. The nurse says, “That’s not advisable.” “Advisable”  (advisable) means recommended or useful or helpful.

The nurse says that Bruce’s idea of just leaving ri ght after this procedure is “not advisable.” It’s not a good idea. “You need to rema in under observation for 24 hours.” The phrase “under observation” means that s omeone is watching you or someone is monitoring you to make sure there aren’t  any more problems. That happens a lot at a hospital. We say someone is “und er observation” when the doctor and the nurses keep the person in the hospit al to make sure there aren’t any more problems.

Bruce says, “That’s for other people. I’m tough,” m eaning I’m strong. I’m brave. “I’ll be up and ready to go,” meaning after the pro cedure he’ll be ready to go home. Then he says to the nurse, “What’s that needl e for?” The nurse says, “It’s to give you a shot,” an injection, “before your pro cedure.” The nurse is going to take the needle and inject, or put into his body, t he drug.

Bruce suddenly, who said he was very tough and stro ng, starts to whimper. “To whimper” (whimper) means to make a small sound that  indicates that you’re very scared. Bruce says, “I don’t like needles. Get that  away from me!” We learn, of course, that Bruce isn’t as tough as he says he is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nurse: I’m here to prep you for your procedure. Did  the doctor already talk to you about the general anesthetic you’ll be getting?

Bruce: I don’t need a general anesthetic. I want to  be conscious during the procedure.

Nurse: You’ll be inhaling a general anesthetic and getting an intravenous muscle relaxant. That’s standard for this procedure.

Bruce: I’m not a wimp. Tell the doctor all I need i s a local anesthetic to numb the area.

# Preparing Packages for Shipping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,244 – Preparing Packages for Shipping.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,244. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Suzanne and Geor ge about sending something to someone else in a big package. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanne: Pass me the packing tape. This box is read y to be sealed.

George: Wait! You can’t just send our product like that. It needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.

Suzanne: That doesn’t speak well for our product, d oes it?

George: It has nothing to do with the quality of ou r product. It’s all about the quality of the packing. Hand me some bubble wrap.

Suzanne: Here.

George: See what I’m doing? I’m wrapping each produ ct in two layers of bubble wrap, placing them in the box, and then filling in the gaps with packing peanuts. Got that?

Suzanne: Fine, I’ll pack it the way you want it. What about these smaller products? You want them packed in a box?

George: No, the smaller products should be shipped in padded mailers like these.

Suzanne: Should I wrap the product in bubble wrap f irst?

 George: No, these padded mailers should protect the m from impact.

Suzanne: Good. Let’s put on a label and be done wit h it.

George: Hold on. These boxes and mailers need to be  taped up so they don’t open during shipping. Make sure all openings are se aled.

Suzanne: Okay, now are we done?

George: Sure, with this batch – just 64 more to go.

Suzanne: Uh!

[end of dialogue]

Suzanne says to George, “Pass me,” or give to me, “ the packing tape.” “Packing” (packing) comes from the verb “to pack” (pack). “To  pack” is to put things into a box or some other container that you are going to s tore or keep those items in, or send them through the mail or some other service to  another person. “Packing tape (tape) is a sticky substance on one side that you put on a package or a box in order to keep it closed. There are different kin ds of tape. Some tape is very thin, only a few millimeters wide; other tape is mu ch wider.

Suzanne is asking for the packing tape. She says, “ This box is ready to be sealed.” “To be sealed” (sealed) means to be closed  so that nothing comes out of it. You need to “seal” a package before you mail it  or send it to someone. You don’t want everything coming out of the box. George , however, says, “Wait! You can’t just send our product like that.” A “product”  is something a company makes to sell to someone. So we’re talking about a busine ss product here.

George says, “The product needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.” “Protected” comes from the verb “to protect” (prote ct). “To protect” means to take care of someone or something so that it is not harm ed or damaged. “To protect a product” means to make sure it doesn’t break – in t his case, that it doesn’t break “in transit” (transit). The expression “in transit”  means while something is being moved from one place to another, especially in the mail. Suzanne says, “That doesn’t speak well for our product, does it?”

Suzanne is saying that the fact you have to protect  the product in order to ship it means that perhaps the product isn’t very good or v ery strong. That’s what she means by the expression, “It doesn’t speak well.” “ To speak well” normally

means to say good things about someone or something . Here it means to reflect on or to be an indication of the quality of the pro duct. George says, however, that the fact they have to protect the product in order to ship it – in order to mail it or to send it – doesn’t have anything to do with the q uality of their product.

George says, “It’s all about,” or it’s mainly conce rned with, “the quality of the packing.” He then says, “Hand me,” meaning give me,  “some bubble wrap.” “Bubble (bubble) wrap (wrap)” is something you use to pack or protect something you are sending. Bubble wrap consists of plastic sh eets that have little pockets or bubbles of air. You’ve probably seen these. You can  take your finger and burst, or break open, the little bubbles and they make sou nds. It’s kind of fun. People like to do this sitting around watching television sometimes. Well, I don’t, but some people do.

George is saying that he wants some bubble wrap to protect the product. By the way, the word “wrap” can also be a verb. “To wrap” means to surround something with another piece of material that will protect what is inside. George says he’s “wrapping each product in two layers of b ubble wrap.” A “layer” (layer) is one of many pieces of material that is covering,  in this case, an object for protection. George says he’s “wrapping each product  in two layers of bubble wrap, placing them,” or putting them, “in the box, and then filling in the gaps with packing peanuts.”

A “gap” (gap) is a space between two other things. It’s a place where there is a small opening between two things, we might say. You  could have a gap in the door if your door is not completely closed. There’s  just an inch or two of space between the door and the, what we would call, “fram e” of the door that the door closes into. That’s a gap. You could have a gap, as  is the case in our dialogue, in a box – between the side of the box and where the t hing you put in the box is located. George says he’s going “to fill in the gap s” – that is, put something in those small spaces – “with packing peanuts” (peanut s).

Normally, a “peanut” is a small thing that you eat.  It’s technically the seed of a certain kind of plant. Peanuts are very popular in the United States; people even make peanut butter, which they use on sandwiches. I  don’t like peanut butter myself, but many people do – but here the word “pea nut” doesn’t refer to an actual piece of food but rather a small piece of pl astic, basically, that is made to look like a small peanut and is used when packing t hings in large boxes.

“Packing peanuts,” then, are small pieces of plasti c – what we would call “Styrofoam” – in the shape of peanuts that are used  to protect things that are being mailed and sent in a box. Suzanne says, “Fine , I’ll pack it the way you want

it. What about these smaller products? You want the m packed in a box?” Suzanne speaks somewhat informally here. Notice she  doesn’t say, “Do you want them packed in a box,” but simply, “You want t hem packed in a box?” You know she’s asking a question, and the “do” (technic ally the auxiliary or helping verb) is implied.

George says, “No, the smaller products should be sh ipped in padded mailers like these.” “To ship” (ship) something means to send it , either in the government mail service or using some private delivery service  such as DHL or FedEx or UPS here in the United States. George is telling Su zanne to ship or send small products in “padded mailers.” The word “pad” (pad) refers to something that is used to protect something else. “Padding” is protec tion that you put around something. Bubble wrap is a kind of padding.

A “padded mailer” (mailer) is an envelope that has padding in it. When you buy the envelope, there is already a kind of bubble wra p or padding that is part of the envelope and is used to protect what’s inside the e nvelope or the mailer. Suzanne says, “Should I wrap the product in bubble wrap first?” George says, “No, these padded mailers should protect them,” mea ning the products, “from impact” (impact). “Impact” is the moment when two t hings hit each other, often causing damage.

So, what George is saying here is that the padded m ailers will protect the products inside even if the mailers hit something e lse. Suzanne says, “Good. Let’s put on,” or let’s attach, “a label and be don e with it.” A “label” (label) is usually a piece of paper that is put on something s uch as a box to tell you either what is inside the box or to whom you are sending t he box. You can’t ship a box through the mail without telling the postal service  where it’s going. That information about whom you are sending it to goes o n the label.

The expression “be done (done) with it” means simpl y that we are finished with something and no longer have to worry about it. If someone says, “Let’s be done with it,” he means let’s finish this and no longer worry about it. George, however, says, “Hold on,” meaning “wait.” “These boxes and m ailers need to be taped up so they don’t open during shipping.” “To tape up” i s a phrasal verb which means basically to put tape on something. There isn’t a d ifference in meaning, or much of a difference, between “to tape a box” and “to ta pe up a box.” The “up” provides a little bit of emphasis.

George says, “Make sure all openings are sealed.” A n “opening” (opening) is the same as a gap, when two things are not closed compl etely. Suzanne says, “Okay, now are we done?” George says, “Sure, with t his batch – just 64 more to

go.” A “batch” (batch) is one of many groups of ite ms that are handled or taken care of at the same time. If you have to send, for example, 100 boxes, you might take care of them in batches of 10 boxes each. Firs t you do these 10 boxes, then you do the next 10 boxes, and so on.

George says to Suzanne that they are done with this  batch, and they just have “64 batches more to go,” meaning left to finish. Su zanne doesn’t sound very happy about that at the end of the dialogue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanne: Pass me the packing tape. This box is read y to be sealed.

George: Wait! You can’t just send our product like that. It needs to be protected so it won’t break in transit.

Suzanne: That doesn’t speak well for our product, d oes it?

# Measuring Mass and Volume

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,245 – Measuring Mass and Volume.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,245. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In fact, you can also help your cultural English by taking a look at our “Introduct ion to the United States” course.

This episode is a dialogue – a short dialogue – bet ween Andre and Dana about measuring mass and volume. Sounds exciting. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Andre: Three gallons of water.

Dana: Check.

Andre: A quart of lemon juice.

Dana: Got it.

Andre: A tablespoon of bleach.

Dana: Bleach?

Andre: Bleach. A pint of vinegar.

Dana: It’s in there.

Andre: A cup of baking soda.

Dana: Okay.

Andre: A teaspoon of liquid detergent.

Dana: Done.

 Andre: A pound of bath salts.

Dana: A pound?

Andre: A pound. Three tablespoons of chlorine.

Dana: Okay.

Andre: An ounce of perfume.

Dana: Done. Do you really think this is necessary?

Andre: Have you smelled your stinky dog?!

[end of dialogue]

Andre begins our dialogue by saying, “Three gallons  of water.” This dialogue is mostly Andre telling Dana about the quantity, mass,  or volume of liquid that the two of them are using for something. We’ll find out  what that is at the end of the dialogue. The first item, the first thing Andre say s, is “Three gallons of water.” A “gallon” (gallon) is a way of measuring what we wou ld describe as “liquid volume.”

Certain substances, such as water, can be either li quid, solid, or gas in form. Water that is solid is called “ice.” Water that is liquid is usually just referred to as “water.” Well, a “gallon” is a way of measuring the  amount, or “volume” (volume), of liquid. I said “volume” is the quantity – techni cally it’s the amount of space that is taken up by a certain substance. That substance could be liquid, but it also could be in the form of a gas. Three gallons of wat er, then, equals, for the rest of you, 3.78 liters.

A gallon in the U.S. is divided into, or can be div ided into, four parts. You could divide a gallon into four what we call “quarts” (qu arts). The word “quart” comes from the word “quarter,” which is 25 percent of som ething. So, one gallon in the U.S. equals four quarts. A quart is a little less t han one liter. Now, a quart can be divided into two equal parts called “pints” (pints) . A “pint” is about a half a liter. So we have the formula, if you will, two pints equals a quart, four quarts equals a gallon.

Andre starts by saying, “Three gallons of water,” a nd Dana says, “Check.” “Check” (check) has a couple of different meanings.  Here it’s used to show

agreement or to indicate to someone else that you h ave done something that the person has asked you to do. It’s also used in other  ways. For example, the verb “to check” can mean to look at or to investigate so mething, to make sure something is done. The meaning of “check” in our di alogue is somewhat related to that.

Dana is indicating that she has done this, that the  task, in this case, of getting three gallons of water has been completed. She’s sa ying that they have three gallons of water. Andre is obviously reading from a  list of things. The second item on his list is “a quart of lemon juice.” Remember a  “quart” is about one liter – one quarter of a gallon. “Lemon juice” is the liquid th at comes from the fruit lemon, which we use to make things like lemonade. Instead of saying “check,” Dana says something equivalent or about the same, which is “Got it,” meaning she understands.

Andre then says, “A tablespoon of bleach.” Now, we’ ve talked about gallons, quarts, and pints. You can also describe the volume  of something by using measurements related to “spoons” (spoon). A “spoon”  is something that you use to eat food with. You have a “knife,” which is long  and sharp. You have a “fork,” which has typically three or more what we call “tin es” (tines) – those are those little parts that stick out in a fork that you use to put into the food. And you can have a “spoon,” also to eat food.

You can use “spoons” to measure or to indicate how much there is of something. A “tablespoon” (tablespoon) – all one word – is equ al to about a half a fluid ounce – or for those on the metric system, about 15 milli liters of a substance, of a liquid, typically. A smaller unit of measurement, a smaller  way of measuring the amount of something, is a “teaspoon” (teaspoon). There are  three teaspoons in a tablespoon – or to put it another way, a teaspoon i s one third of a tablespoon, about 4.9 milliliters in the metric system, which of course Americans don’t use and don’t understand.

“Bleach” (bleach) is a liquid chemical that is ofte n used to clean things. Technically “bleach” is either sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide. The chemical formulas for that can be found on the inte rnet. This is English, not chemistry we’re teaching here. Dana questions Andre  after he says, “A tablespoon of bleach.” She says, “Bleach?” Notice s he seems to be asking a question. Andre, however, confirms that is exactly what he meant. He says, “Bleach.”

Then he says, “A pint of vinegar.” A “pint” is, of course, one half of a quart, which is one quarter of a gallon. “Vinegar” (vinegar) is a “sour” (sour) liquid often used

in cooking but sometimes in cleaning. “Sour” is the  opposite of “sweet.” Sugar is sweet. Vinegar is sour. People often combine oil wi th vinegar in order to make what we would call “salad dressing,” something you would put on vegetables or a salad. Dana responds to Andre by saying, “It’s in t here,” meaning the pint of vinegar is in whatever combination of liquids Andre  and Dana are talking about.

Andre then says, “A cup of baking soda.” A “cup” (c up) is yet another way of measuring something – measuring liquids, measuring volume. I should probably explain that the title of this episode is “Measurin g Mass (mass) and Volume.” “Mass” is a term used in physics that is related to  volume, but technically I believe it is considered the quantity of substance in a given or certain amount of space. What does that mean? I’m not Einstein. You’l l have to ask a physicist. In conversational English, it’s sometimes used to mean  the same as “weight” (weight).

In any case, Andre mentions “a cup of baking soda.”  A “cup” is even smaller than a pint. Remember a gallon has four quarts. A quart has two pints. A pint has two cups. So, one half of a pint is one cup – or again,  in the metric system, 237 milliliters. I don’t know how you people can unders tand 237 milliliters. I have no idea what that means, but hey, everyone has their o wn system, right? “Baking soda” is technically known as “sodium bicarbonate.”  It’s a white substance, what we would call a “powder” (powder), that is used in cooking and, again like vinegar, sometimes in cleaning.

Dana indicates she has that. She says, “Okay.” Then  Andre says, “A teaspoon of liquid detergent.” A “teaspoon,” again, is one thir d of a tablespoon. “Liquid detergent” (detergent) is something you use to clea n something else. It’s a liquid soap. Dana says, “Done.” Andre then says, “A pound of bath salts.” A “pound” (pound) is a unit of measurement, a way that we ind icate how heavy something is, how much it weighs. A pound is equal to a littl e less than a half a kilo. A pound is .45 kilograms. A pound is equal to 16 ounces.

So just as we can divide a “gallon” into quarts, pi nts, and cups, we can divide a pound into “ounces” (ounces). A pound has sixteen o unces. That makes one ounce equal to 19.6 milliliters. Got that? Understa nd that? Great. Let’s move on. Andre is talking about a pound of “bath (bath) salt s (salts).” “Bath salts” are things you add to water – warm water, usually – to give it a nice smell. Technically bath salts are what we would call “crys tals” (crystals) – a type of substance that, in this case, goes from being solid  to liquid once it is put into water.

Dana questions the amount of bath salts that Andre is talking about. She says, “A pound?” Andre says, “A pound,” meaning yes, that’s how much I want. Then he says, “Three tablespoons of chlorine.” “Chlorine” ( chlorine) is a liquid that is also commonly used for cleaning. Chlorine is one of the atomic elements. Number 17, for those of you taking notes. Dana says, “Okay.”

Finally, Andre says, “An ounce” – remember an ounce  is one sixteenth of a pint – “of perfume” (perfume). Perfume is something you pu t on your body to make you smell nice. Usually “perfume” is the word we use for a liquid that a woman puts on her body. The liquid a man puts on his body is t ypically called “cologne” (cologne). It’s the same thing basically except we give it a different name for a man versus for a woman, and yes, the name comes fro m the city in Germany, also called Cologne, which must be a very nice-smel ling place to visit.

Dana (getting back to our dialogue) says, “Done. Do  you really think this is necessary?” she asks. Andre says, “Have you smelled  your stinky dog?!” A “stinky (stinky) dog” is a dog that has a bad smell , a bad “odor” (odor). Another word we could use for “stinky” is “smelly.” Apparently Dana and Andre are washing Andre’s dog.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andre: Three gallons of water.

Dana: Check.

Andre: A quart of lemon juice.

Dana: Got it.

Andre: A tablespoon of bleach.

Dana: Bleach?

Andre: Bleach. A pint of vinegar.

Dana: It’s in there.

Andre: A cup of baking soda.

 Dana: Okay.

Andre: A teaspoon of liquid detergent.

Dana: Done.

Andre: A pound of bath salts.

Dana: A pound?

Andre: A pound. Three tablespoons of chlorine.

Dana: Okay.

Andre: An ounce of perfume.

Dana: Done. Do you really think this is necessary?

Andre: Have you smelled your stinky dog?!

# Getting a Gynecological Exam

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,246 – Getting a Gynecological Exam.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,246. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  courses that will give you additional help in improving your English.

This episode is a dialogue between Matt and Dr. Rod riguez about having a gynecological exam – the kind of thing that a woman  gets and a man does not. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Matt: Hello, viewers! On our show today, we have Dr . Rodriguez, who is here to tell us about women’s health. Welcome, Dr. Rodrigue z.

Dr. Rodriguez: Thanks for having me.

Matt: Tell us. As a gynecologist, what one piece of  advice would you give to women to help them stay healthy?

Dr. Rodriguez: Well, as part of their regular check ups, they should be getting a gynecological exam.

Matt: This may surprise you, but I’ve never had one . Ha, ha!

Dr. Rodriguez: When women come in for an exam, I ch eck several things. I do a breast exam to check for lumps to detect breast can cer. I also show women how to do this at home on their own.

Matt: Is that all?

Dr. Rodriguez: No, I do a pelvic exam and a Pap sme ar to rule out cervical cancer. I also look for anything problematic, such as unusual discharge or signs of STDs.

Matt: That sounds painful. Ouch!

 Dr. Rodriguez: It’s not painful and it’s very impor tant. I also discuss with women their menstrual cycles, issues related to being sex ually active, birth control methods, fertility issues, and menopause.

Matt: I didn’t know what I was missing!

Dr. Rodriguez: My point is that it’s important for women to talk to their doctor about any medical issues they may have.

Matt: And my point is: I’m glad I’m not a woman!

Dr. Rodriguez: That’s not the message . . .

Matt: Thanks for coming in, doctor. And now, let’s talk about something really important – celebrity news!

[end of dialogue]

The term “gynecology” (gynecology) refers to the st udy of and practice of medicine for women, more specifically for those par ts of the human body that only women have – and if you don’t know what parts those are, you’ll have to ask your parents. Our dialogue begins with Matt saying,  “Hello, viewers!” “Viewers” implies that Matt is on some sort of television pro gram, and that is, in fact, the case. He next says, “On our show today,” meaning on  our television program, “we have” – we have as a guest – “Dr. Rodriguez, wh o is here to tell us about women’s health.”

He then says, “Welcome, Dr. Rodriguez,” and Dr. Rod riguez says, “Thanks for having me,” meaning thanks for inviting me to be on  this show, on this television program. Matt then says, “Tell us. As a gynecologis t, what one piece of advice” – what one thing – “would you give to women to help t hem stay healthy?” A “gynecologist” is a doctor who is specialized in gy necology, women’s medicine.

Dr. Rodriguez answers Matt’s question by saying, “W ell, as part of their regular checkups, they should be getting a gynecological ex am.” A “checkup” (checkup) is when you go to the doctor to have the doctor loo k at you and make sure there is nothing wrong with you. A checkup is usually som ething you do every year or perhaps every two years. We’ll sometimes refer to it as a “regular checkup,” meaning it’s scheduled even if you aren’t sick. You  go to the doctor and have the doctor examine you, look at you, make sure you’re o kay.

Dr. Rodriguez is recommending that women get regula r gynecological exams. Matt says, “This may surprise you, but I’ve never h ad one. Ha, ha!” He laughs. Of course, Matt is a man and men don’t get gynecologic al exams, though they do get other kinds of exams that women don’t, and we w on’t talk about those today. Dr. Rodriguez continues. She says, “When women come  in,” that is when they go to her office, “for an exam,” an examination or che ckup, “I check,” or look at, “several things. I do a breast exam to check for lu mps to detect breast cancer.”

A woman’s “breasts” are those two parts of her uppe r body that are on her chest. A “breast exam” is when a doctor uses his or her ha nds to look at the breast to make sure there isn’t any problem– to make sure in particular there are no “lumps” (lumps). A “lump” is a hard, raised area of  what we would call “tissue” (tissue) which is part of the body. A lump under the skin in the breast area could indicate that someone has breast cancer.

Dr. Rodriguez uses the verb “to detect” (detect). “ To detect” means to find and identify something – in this case, to make sure the  woman doesn’t have breast cancer. Dr. Rodriguez says, “I also show women how to do this at home on their own,” meaning how women can examine or check their own breasts to make sure there are no lumps indicating possible cancer.

Matt then says, “Is that all?” meaning is that all that you do? Dr. Rodriguez says, “No, I do a pelvic exam and a Pap smear to rule out  cervical cancer.” A “pelvic (pelvic) exam” is an examination of a woman’s pelvi s, which is basically the sexual and what we would call “reproductive” organs  – those parts of a woman’s body which would allow the woman to have a baby. So , the doctor does a pelvic exam and also does something called a “Pap (pap) sm ear (smear).”

A Pap smear is a special examination during which t he doctor collects cells, or small parts of a woman’s body, in order to make sur e that the woman doesn’t have any sort of cancer down in her pelvis area. the doctor then takes those small parts of the body, the cells, and sends them to be tested so that the doctor can see if there are any signs of cancer of the pel vis. The cancer that the doctor is trying to detect is called “cervical (cervical) cancer.” Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix, which is inside of a woman’s body as  part of her “sexual organs,” we would say. You can Google it.

The phrasal verb “to rule (rule) out” means to test  something to make sure that it is not an option, to eliminate something as a possi bility. If a doctor is trying “to rule out cervical cancer,” he’s trying to make sure  that you do not have that kind of cancer by giving you a test. Unhappily, sometime s the doctor discovers that you do have cancer. He or she is not able “to rule it out.” Dr. Rodriguez

continues, “I also look for anything problematic,” meaning anything that looks like it might be a problem, “such as an unusual discharg e or signs of STDs.”

A “discharge” (discharge) is, in this case, a liqui d that comes out of the body that is unexpected or perhaps indicates some sort of pro blem. “STD” stands for “sexually transmitted diseases.” These are illnesse s that are passed or transmitted from one person to another through some  sort of sexual contact. Interesting fact: 110 million Americans, as of 2016 , have at any given time a sexually transmitted disease. The adult population of the United States in 2016 is around 216 million, meaning close to half of all Am ericans have an STD. So there’s that. Back to our dialogue.

Matt says, after Dr. Rodriguez talks about these un usual discharges, “That sounds painful. Ouch!” “Ouch” (ouch) is a word we u se when something is painful, something is causing us pain. He, of cours e, is trying to make a joke. Dr. Rodriguez says, however, that “it’s not painful and  it’s very important.” Dr. Rodriguez is referring, I think, to the pelvic exam  and Pap smear she talked about earlier.

Dr. Rodriguez continues, “I also discuss with women  their menstrual cycles, issues related to being sexually active, birth cont rol methods, fertility issues, and menopause.” A “menstrual (menstrual) cycle (cycle)”  is the process that women between certain ages go through each month as part of the body’s natural process of preparing a woman to have a baby, if the  conditions are right.

“To be sexually active” means to be having sexual r elations with another person. “Birth control” is a manner and approach, sometimes  a specific drug or device, that is used to prevent a woman from getting pregna nt. Research has found that the most effective form of birth control is not hav ing sex. True. Another thing Dr. Rodriguez mentions is “fertility” (fertility). “Fer tility” is the ability to have children, whether a man or a woman, or at least to participat e in the creation of new life.

“Menopause” (menopause) is a period in a woman’s li fe when, as she gets older, she stops having her normal menstrual cycle and is therefore no longer able to give birth, to have a child naturally. This happens  for many women sometime between the ages of 45 and 50. A man never has meno pause per se, although men as they get older are also typically less ferti le. Unless you’re Mick Jagger, the rock star who recently had a child, or we would  say “fathered a child,” at the age of 71.

Matt, again trying to be funny, says, “I didn’t kno w what I was missing!” referring to what Dr. Rodriguez was talking about. The expres sion “I didn’t know what I

was missing” is used to show how you were unaware of something. You didn’t know about something, especially something that per haps you would want to participate in. That’s the joke here, of course. Ma tt, being a man, cannot have a gynecological examination.

Dr. Rodriguez says, “My point” – what I’m trying to  say – “is that it’s important for women to talk to their doctor about any medical iss ues,” any problems, “they may have.” Matt says, “And my point is: I’m glad I’m no t a woman!” Once again, Matt is trying to be funny. Dr. Rodriguez, however, does n’t have much of a sense of humor. She doesn’t think this is funny. Dr. Rodrigu ez says, “That’s not the message . . .”

And then Matt interrupts. He, we would say, “cuts h er off.” He stops her from speaking. He says, “Thanks for coming in, doctor. A nd now let’s talk about something really important – celebrity news!” “Cele brity” refers to someone who is famous. Matt, of course, is now going to talk ab out something that most people don’t consider very important at all – what rich, f amous people are doing, people like, you know, Mick Jagger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Matt: Hello, viewers! On our show today, we have Dr . Rodriguez, who is here to tell us about women’s health. Welcome, Dr. Rodrigue z.

Dr. Rodriguez: Thanks for having me.

Matt: Tell us. As a gynecologist, what one piece of  advice would you give to women to help them stay healthy?

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,247 – Doing Meal Planning.

This episode is a dialogue between Donny and Helene  about planning what you’re going to eat this week. I’m hungry already. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Donny: Have you ever heard of something called a “m eal plan”?

Helene: Sure, I make one each week before I go groc ery shopping. It saves time and money.

Donny: My mother suggested I make one now that I’m staying home with the kids and Sydney is going back to work.

Helene: See this? This is my meal plan. I map out t he dinners I’ll be making each day. It helps me a lot.

Donny: How? It seems like a lot of work.

Helene: Well, for one thing, I only have to go groc ery shopping once a week. I buy a week’s worth of groceries in one fell swoop.

Donny: I guess that’s helpful, but it still seems l ike too much work.

Helene: Here’s what I do. I look at each week’s sto re circular to see what’s seasonal and on sale. I pull out my recipes that in clude those items and I see if I have any coupons I can use.

Donny: I still don’t see how I can save much money.

Helene: I also use the sale items for more than one  meal and make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. It works lik e a charm.

Donny: I think I’ll stick to my original plan.

Helene: Which is?

Donny: To plead ignorance and ask my mother over to  our house to give me cooking lessons. By the time I cook well enough on my own, the children will be nearly full-grown!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Donny asking Helene, “Have  you ever heard of something called a ‘meal plan’?” A “meal” (meal) is  what you eat at a certain time during the day. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are th ree meals that most people eat each day. A “meal plan” is something you write down  describing what you’re going to eat in the next, say, week or even month. Helene says, “Sure, I make one,” meaning I write a meal plan, “each week befor e I go grocery shopping.”

“Grocery (grocery) shopping” refers going to a stor e to buy food. “Groceries” is another word for food that you buy in a store to ea t and or prepare at home. Helene says, “It’s saves time and money” – that is,  having a meal plan saves time and money. Donny says that his mother suggeste d that he make a meal plan since he is now staying home with his kids, hi s children, and Sidney, his wife, is going back to work. Helene says, “See this ?” She’s obviously showing something to Donny we can’t see. Well, you can’t se e it. I can see it because I’m right here.

Helene says, “See this? This is my meal plan. I map  out the dinners I’ll be making each day.” “To map (map) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that can mean simply to plan and describe something in detail by writing it down. People will sometimes use this expression in business. “Let’s m ap out our future.” Let’s plan what we’re going to do in the next month or two mon ths or year. Literally, “to map out” would be to draw on a piece of paper or to tak e a map and indicate where you are going to travel. Donny says, “How?” How doe s this help you? “It seems like a lot of work.”

Helene says, “Well, for one thing, I only have to g o grocery shopping once a week. I buy a week’s worth of groceries in one fell  swoop.” Helene says she only goes to the grocery store once of week. She buys “a  week’s worth” (worth). A “week’s worth” of something would be enough of some thing that would last you,

that would be enough for you to use, for an entire seven days. “A month’s worth” would be enough for a month, and so forth. She buys  “a week’s worth of groceries in one fell (fell) swoop (swoop).” The ex pression “in one fell swoop” means all at once, at a single time.

Donny says, “I guess that’s helpful, but it still s eems like too much work.” Helene then explains what she does. She says, “I look at e ach week’s store circular to see what’s seasonal and on sale.” Here in the Unite d States, grocery stores will often include in a local newspaper or mail to you s omething called a “circular” (circular). The word “circular” is just a special t erm for an advertisement that shows all of the discounts, all of the sales, at a particular store. Helene looks for “seasonal food.” Food that is “seasonal” (seasonal)  is food that is fresh. We’re talking here about fruits and vegetables.

Helene says she also looks for anything else that’s  “on sale.” “To be on sale” (sale) means it is being sold at a lower price than  usual, than normal. She says, “I pull out my recipes that include these items and  I see if I have any coupons I can use.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written i nstructions or steps on how to prepare a certain kind of food. A “coupon” (coupon)  is usually a small piece of paper that gives you a certain discount, a lower pr ice, when you bring it to the store. Nowadays people have coupons that are electr onic that you can have on your phone or in an email.

Donny says, “I still don’t see how I can save much money,” meaning a lot of money. Helene says, “I also use the sale items for more than one meal and to make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next da y.” “Leftovers” (leftovers) refers to food that you prepared for one meal but d idn’t finish, and therefore are able to eat at a later time. So, if you make someth ing for dinner and you have some food that is “leftover,” that is extra, you ca n eat that food tomorrow for lunch.

Helene says, “It works like a charm” – that is, her  plan “works like a charm” (charm). The expression “to work like a charm” mean s it works very well. It’s an excellent solution to a problem. Donny, however, do esn’t seem convinced. He’s not persuaded. He says, “I think I’ll stick to my o riginal plan.” “To stick (stick) to” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to con tinue doing what you have been doing, to continue doing something without cha nging it. Donny is going to stick to his first or original plan. Helene says, “ Which is?” meaning “What is that plan?”

Donny then explains: “To plead ignorance and ask my  mother over to our house to give me cooking lessons.” “To plead (plead) igno rance (ignorance)” means to

say that you don’t know something or understand som ething, even though you may in fact know it or understand it. If someone “p leads ignorance,” they say “I didn’t know” or “I don’t know” something. Maybe tha t person is telling the truth and maybe he isn’t. Donny wants to plead ignorance about cooking and ask his mother over to his house – that is to say, “invite”  her to his house – to give him “cooking lessons,” to teach him how to cook.

He says, “By the time I cook well enough on my own, ” meaning by the time or by that point in the future when I am able to cook wit hout my mother’s help, “the children will be nearly full-grown.” “To be “full ( full) – grown (grown)” means to be an adult, to no longer be a child. If we say someon e is “full-grown,” we mean that person is now no longer a child. They’re 18 years old or 21 years old, or it could also refer to a adolescent who has stopped growing,  who will no longer get any taller, for example. “Full-grown” could also descri be a plant or a tree that will no longer grow any more or get any bigger than it is n ow.

Here it refers to Donny’s children becoming old eno ugh so that they are adults. Donny is saying that because he will learn to cook so slowly from his mother, his mother will in fact do most of the cooking for his children until they are practically adults. It sounds to me like Donny’s plan is better  than any meal plan.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Donny: Have you ever heard of something called a “m eal plan”?

Helene: Sure, I make one each week before I go groc ery shopping. It saves time and money.

Donny: My mother suggested I make one now that I’m staying home with the kids and Sydney is going back to work.

This episode is a dialogue between Oleg and Raquel about describing machines – equipment – that are old and new. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Oleg: Geez, look at that dinosaur.

Raquel: This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic. It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.

Oleg: It’s an antique and belongs in a museum. You’ ve got to get with it and get one of these.

Raquel: What’s that?

Oleg: It’s the latest model, with cutting edge desi gn. It’s brand spanking new.

Raquel: That’s all right. This machine is tried-and -true and it never lets me down.

Oleg: Why don’t you take this for a test drive? It’ ll be an eye-opening experience for you.

Raquel: No, thanks.

Oleg: You don’t know what you’re missing.

Raquel: That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.

Oleg: Fine. I’m just trying to help you move with t he times.

 Raquel: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stick with what  I know and love.

Oleg: It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.

[end of dialogue]

Oleg begins our dialogue by saying to Raquel, “Geez , look at that dinosaur.” “Geez” (geez) is a word we used to express surprise  or amazement at something. Oleg is amazed at a “dinosaur” (dinosaur ). The word “dinosaur” usually refers to an animal that is no longer found  living on Earth. However, we also use the word “dinosaur” to describe something or even someone who is very, very old. In describing a person, it usually refers to someone in leadership or power in an organization or a government.

When it’s used to describe a piece of equipment, a machine, it refers to something that is no longer very usable because it is so old. So, if you have a computer from the 1980s, it would probably be descr ibed as a “dinosaur” because it’s so old you can’t really use it for any thing. Raquel disagrees with Oleg’s description of her machine. She says, “This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic.” A “classic” (classic) is something that i s old but is considered to be of very high quality, something that people admire or recognize as being good.

We might describe an old car as a “classic.” In fac t, people talk about “classic cars,” or “classic movies.” These are things that w e consider to have a lot of value or to be of high quality. Citizen Kane or The  Godfather might be described as “classic movies.” Don’t confuse “classic” with “ classical” (classical). “Classical” usually refers to something from the ancient Greek or Roman period of history, at least in the Western world. Raquel says her machine  is “a classic.” She says, “It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.”

“To go out of style” means to be no longer very pop ular, to no longer be what we might describe as “fashionable” – something that pe ople like, something that people want to have. Certain ways of dressing “go o ut of style.” People no longer wear that kind of shirt or those kinds of pants. Ra quel says, however, that what she has “will never go out of style.” She says, “It ’s built to last” (last). If something is “built to last,” it will not break or stop worki ng in the future. Something that is “built to last” is built very well. It’s constructe d very well.

Oleg says, however, “It’s an antique and belongs in  a museum.” An “antique” (antique) is some object that is considered old. Us ually we talk about something more than 100 years old as being an “antique.” Furn iture, art, pottery – other

objects that people like to collect, like to own, a re often referred to as “antiques” if they are very old. I love watching television progr ams about antiques. I like to watch a British show called Bargain Hunt where they  go and try to find antiques. I know it’s a little weird.

Anyway, Oleg says that he thinks the machine that R aquel has “belongs in a museum” (museum). A “museum” is a building that has  objects that are either very old or are pieces of art that people want to l ook at. In this case, he thinks this object is very old. He says, “You’ve got to ge t with it and get one of these.” “To get with it” is an expression meaning to become  familiar with what is happening now, to understand things that are going on right now or that are popular now.

Raquel asks, “What’s that?” Oleg is showing her som ething. Oleg says, “It’s the latest model,” meaning it’s the most recent kind of  this thing. He says it has “cutting edge design.” The expression “cutting (cut ting) edge (edge)” means very modern, or with the latest technology, the latest a dvanced design. He says, “It’s brand spanking new.” The expression “brand (brand) new” means that it is very new, that it has not been used by anyone else befor e you bought it. That’s something that is “brand new.”

The word “spanking” (spanking) in this expression i s used for emphasis. It means the same as “very” or “extremely.” “It’s really bra nd new.” “It’s brand spanking new.” It’s somewhat unusual to see that constructio n of putting the adjective after “brand” – “brand spanking new.” You might think it would be “spanking brand new,” but it isn’t. We say “brand spanking new.” It ’s an idiom. It’s just the way that we express that particular idea with those words. I t just means “very new.”

Raquel says, “That’s all right,” meaning no, she is n’t interested. “This machine” – the one that she owns – “is tried-and-true and it n ever lets me down.” To describe something as “tried (tried) – and – true ( true)” means that it has been tested and proven to work well. It’s something that  you have used for a long time and you know that it works. That’s something that i s “tried-and-true.” The word “tried” here means tested, or used to make sure tha t it works.

The machine, according to Raquel, never lets her do wn. “To let (let) someone down” means to disappoint someone, to do something that does not meet someone’s expectations. Raquel says this machine ne ver lets her down. Oleg says, “Why don’t you take this for a test drive?” T he expression “to take something for a test (test) drive” means to try som ething for a short time to see if you like it, especially something you are consideri ng buying.

If you are going to buy a car, you would go to a pl ace that sells cars, called a “car dealership,” and you would take a car for a “test d rive.” You would get in and drive the car. We use that expression “to take some thing for a test drive” more generally to refer to trying anything, usually a ma chine of some sort, for a short time to see if you like it and want to buy it.

Oleg says that taking whatever he has for a test dr ive “will be an eye-opening experience” for Raquel. Something that is “eye (eye ) – opening” is something that makes you aware of something or gives you know ledge about something in a way that you have never had before or have never been given before. If you call an experience “eye-opening,” it means it made you see things or realize things – maybe good, maybe bad – that you had not r ealized or seen before.

Raquel, however, is not interested. She says, “No, thanks.” Oleg responds, “You don’t know what you’re missing.” The expression “Yo u don’t know what you’re missing” means that you are not aware of the good t hings that someone else knows about or that I know about. Raquel says, “Tha t’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.” Oleg says, “Fine,” meaning okay. “I’m just trying to help you move with the times.”

The expression “to move with the times” is similar to “to get with it.” It means to change your attitude or to change your actions so t hat you can do what other people are doing. It also means to be more modern, to do things that other people are doing nowadays. Raquel says, “Thanks, bu t no thanks,” meaning thank you for offering that, but I am not intereste d. She says, “I’ll stick with,” meaning I will continue using, “what I know and lov e” – what I am familiar with.

Oleg ends the dialogue by saying, “It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.” There are two expressions there. The first one is “It just goes to show (show).” “It just goes to show” is a phrase used wh en you want to emphasize what another person has said or demonstrated. You a re coming to a conclusion. You are making an observation about something. Oleg ’s observation is another common expression, “There’s no accounting (accounti ng) for taste (taste).”

“There’s no accounting for taste” is a phrase that means that it’s impossible to understand the things that other people like and di slike. There’s no reason, there’s no rational basis sometimes, for why some p eople like some things and dislike other things. I like apple pie and coffee a nd spaghetti and dumplings and different kinds of noodles. Other people like other  food that I don’t like. There’s no good reason. You can’t make an argument why one thing is better than another when it comes to food. That’s why we say, “ There’s no accounting for taste.”

 “Taste,” however, means more than just what kind of  food you like. It’s a general term to describe the things that people like and di slike in other people or in other objects. This expression is sometimes used as a cri ticism – for another person to say, “You have bad taste.” That’s what Oleg is doing here. He’s saying that Raquel doesn’t have good taste because she continue s to use this old machine, whatever it is, instead of moving with the times an d using a new machine.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oleg: Geez, look at that dinosaur.

Raquel: This is not a dinosaur. It’s a classic. It will never go out of style and it’s built to last.

Oleg: It’s an antique and belongs in a museum. You’ ve got to get with it and get one of these.

Raquel: What’s that?

Oleg: It’s the latest model, with cutting edge desi gn. It’s brand spanking new.

Raquel: That’s all right. This machine is tried-and -true and it never lets me down.

Oleg: Why don’t you take this for a test drive? It’ ll be an eye-opening experience for you.

Raquel: No, thanks.

Oleg: You don’t know what you’re missing.

Raquel: That’s true, but I’m happy with my machine.

Oleg: Fine. I’m just trying to help you move with t he times.

Raquel: Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll stick with what  I know and love.

Oleg: It just goes to show there’s no accounting for taste.

# Making Temporary Repairs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,249 – Making Temporary Repairs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,249. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about fixing things that  are broken, at least for a short time, until you can fix them permanently. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Desiree: Hey, what happened to the lights?

Chris: I think you have a short or maybe a loose wi re.

Desiree: My guests are going to arrive any minute. What am I going to do?

Chris: Don’t worry. In an emergency, I’m your man. Whatever the problem is, I can probably find a stopgap solution.

Desiree: Are you sure? I don’t want you to get elec trocuted.

Chris: When I was growing up, we lived in the middl e of nowhere and my parents had to make do. They improvised all the time, using  what was on hand to make repairs.

Desiree: They both sound very handy.

Chris: They did what they had to do. Whatever the p roblem was, they were able to cobble together something, even if it was a litt le makeshift. I like to think I learned a thing or two from them.

Desiree: So do you think you can fix this?

Chris: Well, it’s not going to be done properly, bu t I’ll jury-rig something so the lights will work temporarily until you can get it r epaired professionally.

Desiree: That’s great, but just in case, I think I’ ll run to the store for some candles.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Making Temporary (temporary ) Repairs.” Something that is “temporary” is for a short time. The opposite of  “temporary” is “permanent” (permanent). Desiree says to Chris, in our dialogue , “What happened to the lights?” Chris says, “I think you have a short or m aybe a loose wire.”

Electricity is, of course, transmitted through wire s to your light bulbs and your computers and other machines in your house. If thes e wires somehow touch each other in a way they shouldn’t, you can get som ething called a “short” (short). The word “short” is short for “short circu it,” which is when the two wires touch each other in such a way that the electricity  no longer transmits properly to your lights or your other machines.

Desiree says, “My guests are going to arrive any mi nute.” Desiree, we guess here, is having a party and she has invited people to her house – her guests – and the guests are supposed to arrive or show up “a ny minute,” meaning very soon. Desiree has some problem with her lights and she’s asking Chris for help. Chris says, “Don’t worry. In an emergency, I’m your  man.”

An “emergency” (emergency) is some unexpected, sudd en situation that is dangerous or is going to cause, or has caused, some  harm. Chris is saying that if you find yourself in a dangerous situation or a sit uation that you need help with, he is your man. He says, “I’m your man.” That expre ssion is used to mean that you have the skills or the knowledge or the experie nce to do what another person needs you to do.

For example, if you know a lot about programming – computer programming – and someone says, “I need someone to help me build a new app for the Google Play or Apple App Store,” you might say, “I’m your man.” That means “I know what you need in order to get this done.” I have the skills. I have the qualifications, we might say. That’s what Chris is saying to Desiree. Maybe he likes Desiree, and like a lot of guys – like a lot of men – he wants to impress her. He wants her to think that he is intelligent or he has a lot of skills.

Chris says, “I’m your man. Whatever the problem is,  I can probably find a stopgap solution.” A solution that is “stopgap” (st opgap) is temporary. It won’t last a long time, but it will be good enough for now. De siree says, “Are you sure? I don’t want you to get electrocuted.” “To get electr ocuted” (electrocuted) is to get an electrical shock – that is, to receive a high am ount of electricity accidentally, usually so much so that it can kill you, that you m ight be harmed or even killed by it.

Now, sometimes people get electrocuted on purpose. When a government decides to kill someone because that person is a cr iminal, one way of doing it is to electrocute the person – to put electricity into  his body until he’s dead. But here we’re talking about accidental electrocution. Desiree is concerned that perhaps Chris doesn’t know what he’s doing. Chris s ays, however, “When I was growing up, we lived in the middle of nowhere and m y parents had to make do.”

“To live in the middle of nowhere” means to live fa r away from any city or far away from other people. Chris says he grew up “in t he middle of nowhere” – that is, in a small town or perhaps on a farm somewhere – and his parents “had to make do.” The verb “to make do” is an unusual one. We usually think of the verb “to make” or the verb “to do,” but there’s actually  a verb in English which is “to make do,” and that means to be satisfied with what you have or with what is possible even though it isn’t a perfect solution to  the problem.

So if someone says to you, “You just have to make d o,” that person means you have to be satisfied or happy with whatever you hav e, even if it isn’t enough or even if it isn’t a perfect solution to your problem . If you don’t have enough money, you have “to make do.” You have to just find a solu tion even if it isn’t a perfect one. Chris says his parents “had to make do.” “They  improvised all the time, using what was on hand to make repairs.”

“To improvise” (improvise) means to do something wi thout a plan, to do something without having thought about it carefully  before doing it. Sometimes that’s necessary in an emergency. You have to “thin k creatively,” we might say. You have to think of a solution right away. That’s “improvising.”

There is actually a form of comedy called “improvis ation,” where the actors and actresses or the comedians make up jokes right ther e on the spot without having a chance to write them down and practice them. They ’re doing it live. In fact, we call that kind of comedy – improvisation comedy – “ improv.” It means to improvise a joke, to think of the joke right away w ithout having a chance to prepare it. It’s one of my favorite kinds of comedy .

The verb “to improvise,” however, is used more gene rally to mean to do anything without planning it first. Chris says that his pare nts “improvised all the time,” meaning frequently, “using what was on hand (hand) to make repairs.” “On hand” means what is available and ready to use right now.  Desiree says that Chris’s parents “sound very handy” (handy). “To be handy” m eans to be very good at using your hands and simple tools in order to fix t hings.

A person who is “handy” is someone who is able to r epair or fix things in a house, for example. We even have the expression a “handyma n.” A “handyman” is someone that you can pay money to, to come over to your house and fix small problems. Handymen usually also don’t have the educ ation or licenses to fix things like electric problems or plumbing, although  many times they are able to do those sorts of things. The adjective “handy,” th en, is used to refer to someone or describe someone who has those skills and abilit ies.

Chris says that his parents “did what they had to d o.” “Whatever the problem was,” he says, the parents “were able to cobble tog ether something, even if it was a little makeshift.” “To cobble (cobble) togeth er something” means to be able to combine or put different things together quickly  in order to solve a problem. If a solution to your problem is “makeshift” (makeshift) , it is temporary. It is something that was done quickly to solve the problem now, but  is not a permanent repair or solution.

“I like to think I learned a thing or two from them ,” meaning from his parents. The expression “to learn a thing or two” means to get s ome basic knowledge about something through your experiences with it. So, by taking time in trying to understand web design, “I learned a thing or two” f rom that experience of trying to solve some basic problems with my website. That would be one way of using that expression. Desiree then asks Chris, “So do yo u think you can fix this?”

Chris says, “Well, it’s not going to be done proper ly,” meaning I’m not going to fix it the correct way, “but I’ll jury-rig something so  the lights will work temporarily until you can get it repaired professionally.” “To jury (jury) – rig (rig)” something is to repair something or fix something for a short ti me until you can do it correctly later. It’s a temporary fix of something. Chris thi nks he can fix the lights temporarily until Desiree can get them repaired or fixed professionally by an electrician, by someone who has the skills to do it  correctly.

Desiree says, “That’s great, but just in case, I th ink I’ll run to the store for some candles.” “Just in case” (case) is a common express ion meaning “as a precaution.” I’m going to do something to prepare m yself if this other thing doesn’t work. For example, when I was in my early t wenties, I decided I would

get a teaching license. I would go back to school a nd get a license from the government to be a teacher, “just in case” I needed  to have a job, because I didn’t really want to become a teacher but I though t, “Well, the world will always need teachers. I will always be able to get a job.”

So, I got my teaching license “just in case.” Then I discovered I really liked teaching and decided to continue being a teacher, b ut originally that wasn’t my plan. I got my license “just in case” whatever else  I wanted to do didn’t work out, wasn’t successful. Well, Desiree wants to go to the  store to get some candles just in case Chris is not able to fix her lights. “ Candles” (candles) are blocks of wax with a string that you light with a fire and bu rn in order to give you light.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Desiree: Hey, what happened to the lights?

Chris: I think you have a short or maybe a loose wi re.

Desiree: My guests are going to arrive any minute. What am I going to do?

Chris: Don’t worry. In an emergency, I’m your man. Whatever the problem is, I can probably find a stopgap solution.

Desiree: Are you sure? I don’t want you to get elec trocuted.

Chris: When I was growing up, we lived in the middl e of nowhere and my parents had to make do. They improvised all the time, using  what was on hand to make repairs.

Desiree: They both sound very handy.

Chris: They did what they had to do. Whatever the p roblem was, they were able to cobble together something, even if it was a litt le makeshift. I like to think I learned a thing or two from them.

Desiree: So do you think you can fix this?

Chris: Well, it’s not going to be done properly, bu t I’ll jury-rig something so the lights will work temporarily until you can get it r epaired professionally.

 Desiree: That’s great, but just in case, I think I’ ll run to the store for some candles.

# Dealing With Bossy People

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,250 – Dealing with Bossy People.

This episode is a dialogue between Rachel and Logan  about having to work with or live with people who like to tell you what to do . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rachel: What you need to do is . . .

Logan: Stop bossing me around! I know what I’m doing so back off.

Rachel: What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossing you  around. I’m trying to help you. Some people are so ungrateful.

Logan: It’s true that I’ve made my share of mistake s, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.

Rachel: Here’s a reality check: Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in troub le again.

Logan: When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten ho w pushy and controlling you are. I’m not going to let you walk all over me like  you did when we were kids.

Rachel: Who is trying to walk all over you? If you think I’m being high-handed then I’m out of here.

Logan: Good. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place.

Rachel: Well, things never change, do they?

 Logan: Apparently not!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Rachel saying to Logan, “W hat you need to do is . . .” Logan interrupts her. He stops her and says, “Stop”  – meaning quit – “bossing me around.” “To boss (boss) someone around” is a ph rasal verb meaning to tell another person what to do, even when you do not hav e any authority over that person. So for example, if you are at work and some one you work with starts telling you what to do, even though that person is not your boss – that is not the person in charge of you – you might consider that p erson as trying “to boss you around.” That person isn’t the one that is supposed  to tell you what to do, but he is telling you what to do anyway.

“To be bossy” (bossy) means to always be telling ot her people what they should do even though you don’t have the authority to do t hat. Now, when a parent tells a child what to do, we don’t call that being “bossy ” because we expect the parent to tell the child what to do. “Bossy” as an adjecti ve refers to people who are telling other people to do things even though they shouldn’t be or don’t have the authority to do so.

Logan says, “I know what I’m doing so back off.” Lo gan is telling Rachel “to back off.” “To back off” is a two-word phrasal verb mean ing to stop telling another person what to do, or simply to tell another person  to stop being so aggressive – to stop trying to control you. If someone is always  attacking you or always criticizing you, you might say, “You know what? Bac k off. Don’t continue to criticize me.” You might also use this phrasal verb  in a physical confrontation – that is, when another person comes close to you and  perhaps wants to fight you. You might tell that person “to back off” – to move away from you physically.

Rachel says, “What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossi ng you around.” The expression “What’s gotten (gotten) into you” is an informal expression in English meaning “Why are you so different?” It’s a question  used to express your surprise at how another person seems to have change d. You don’t understand why. Perhaps the other person is saying things that  you think are strange or unusual, or at least not typical of that person’s n ormal behavior.

Rachel says she’s not bossing Logan around; she’s t rying to help him. Then she says, “Some people are so ungrateful.” “To be grate ful” (grateful) means to be thankful, to appreciate what another person has don e. So, “to be ungrateful” means to be not thankful, not to appreciate what an other person has done.

Logan says, “It’s true that I’ve made my share of m istakes, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.”

The expression “my share (share) of” something refe rs to your experience with something or of something. “I’ve had my share of go od times and bad times,” meaning I’ve had a certain amount of good times and  bad times – I’ve had a lot of those experiences, perhaps. Logan also says that  he doesn’t need Rachel “to push him around.” “To push someone around” is anoth er two-word phrasal verb that means the same as to boss someone around, to c ontrol another person.

He says he doesn’t need Rachel to push him around b y “calling all the shots.” The expression “to call all the shots” (shots) mean s to make all of the important decisions without letting other people have a say o r influence the decisions. Rachel responds by saying, “Here’s a reality check. ” A “reality (reality) check (check)” is an opportunity to think about what you are saying or what you believe compared to what is really happening. People use th is expression when they are trying to say to another person, “You are not reali stic” or “You don’t really understand what’s going on here, so I’m going to te ll you.”

Rachel says, “Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in trouble again.” Rac hel is telling Logan that he needs her “to keep an eye on” him. “To keep an eye on” someone is to watch someone, especially to make sure that person doesn’ t do anything wrong, or if we’re talking about a young child, to make sure the  child doesn’t hurt himself.

Sometimes we use this expression just to mean “Watc h my things so no one steals them.” If you’re at a cafe and you need to g o to the restroom and want to leave your computer on your table, you may ask anot her person, whom often you don’t even know, “to keep an eye on your stuff,” on  your things, while you go to the bathroom. People do this all the time, trusting  that just because the other person is sitting there at a table next to you, he won’t steal your things.

Rachel also says that she needs “to steer” Logan “a way from bad decisions.” “To steer” (steer) here means simply to guide, to make sure someone is moving in the right direction. We also use this verb when tal king about a car. We “steer” the car when we move the wheel, the round thing called a “steering wheel,” in one direction or another. You are making sure the car i s moving in the right direction or the direction you want to go. Rachel says she ne eds to steer Logan away from bad decisions. That means she is there to prevent h im from making a bad decision.

Logan, however, says, “When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten how pushy and controlling you are.” “To be pushy” (pushy) is the same as to be bossy. It can also simply refer to someone who is very insistent,  who doesn’t give up, who is constantly trying to get his way by asking perhaps again and again and again. “To be controlling” means to not let other people make decisions or to try to make decisions for other people. Logan says, “I’m not go ing to let you walk all over me.” “To walk all over” someone is an expression me aning to control another person completely, perhaps by making all of the dec isions for that person.

Rachel says, “Who is trying to walk all over you? I f you think I’m being high- handed then I’m out of here.” “To be high (high) – handed (handed)” means to use your power and control over another person with out considering that person’s feelings or reactions. The expression “I’m  out of here” is an informal one meaning “I’m leaving” or “I’m no longer going to be  involved in this situation.” Sometimes it just means “I’m leaving immediately,” but often it is used in the sense of “I’m unhappy with this situation, and ther efore I am leaving right now.”

Rachel says, “I’m out of here,” and Logan says, “Go od. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place .” The expression “I don’t know what possessed me” is used when a person regrets hi s decision to do something – when a person decides that what they decided to d o before was wrong. We use it in a situation when we’ve changed our minds and are saying that we don’t even understand why we thought differently before. The expression “in the first place” can mean simply originally or in the first i nstance – at the beginning of a situation.

Rachel says, “Well, things never change, do they?” Rachel and Logan are siblings – brother and sister – and Logan thinks th at Rachel is acting just like she did when they were younger, when they were children . That’s why Rachel says, “Things never change, do they?” and Logan responds,  “Apparently not!” “Apparently” means seemingly, or it appears to be t rue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rachel: What you need to do is . . .

Logan: Stop bossing me around! I know what I’m doing so back off.

Rachel: What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossing you  around. I’m trying to help you. Some people are so ungrateful.

 Logan: It’s true that I’ve made my share of mistake s, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.

Rachel: Here’s a reality check: Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in troub le again.

Logan: When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten ho w pushy and controlling you are. I’m not going to let you walk all over me like  you did when we were kids.

Rachel: Who is trying to walk all over you? If you think I’m being high-handed then I’m out of here.

Logan: Good. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place.

Rachel: Well, things never change, do they?

Logan: Apparently not!

This episode is a dialogue between Andy and Diane a bout getting someone to admit he did something wrong – a confession. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: I got it! I got a confession.

Diane: You got a confession out of that suspect? Ho w did you do it? We’ve been after that guy for days.

Andy: I put the pressure on and he buckled.

Diane: Did you make threats?

Andy: Of course I made threats. It’s an interrogati on, not a tea party.

Diane: The confession is no good if it’s coerced.

Andy: I may have gone over the line a little, but w ho’s to know?

Diane: He knows and any half-decent lawyer will mak e mincemeat out of that confession. He’ll get it thrown out of court in a h eartbeat.

Andy: I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s not l ike I put the screws on him.

Diane: You have a lot to learn.

Andy: Do you think I should go back in there and ta lk to him?

Diane: Stay out of there. You’ve done enough damage . Rookies!

[end of dialogue]

Andy begins our dialogue by saying to Diane, “I got  it! I got a confession.” Here, “to get a confession” means to get someone else to make or give you a confession. A “confession” (confession) is when you  say that you did something wrong – when you state that you have broken the law , for example, or done something that you should not have done – in a lega l context, in a legal situation. A “confession” is when someone who broke the law te lls the police that he is guilty, that he broke the law.

The word “confession” is also used in some Christia n churches to refer to a formal act of asking for forgiveness and what’s cal led “absolution” of having done something wrong. But here we’re just talking about a confession to the police. Diane says, “You got a confession out of that suspe ct?” A “suspect” (suspect) is a person who is believed to have committed a crime or broken a law, but we don’t have any proof or evidence yet, or at least n ot very much. A suspect is someone the police believe is guilty of a crime.

Diane says, “How did you do it?” How did you get a confession out of or from that suspect? “We’ve been after that guy for days.” “To be after” someone means to be trying to get information from someone or trying  to catch or find someone. “To be after” can also be used to mean simply to be try ing to reach a certain goal or a certain objective. “I am after a victory.” I am try ing to get, I am pursuing, a victory. Here, Diane refers to being “after that guy” in the  sense of trying to get him to make a confession.

Andy says that he “put pressure on” the suspect and  “he buckled.” “To put pressure on” someone is to try to influence someone  by doing something that would persuade him to take the action you want him to take. Andy says he “put pressure on” the suspect and “he buckled.” “To buck le” (buckle) here refers to doing something that you don’t really want to do be cause another person is forcing you or pressuring you to do it.

If your daughter keeps asking for ice cream, and sh e does it over and over and over and over again, eventually you might buckle. You might say, “Oh, okay. I’ll buy you an ice cream.” This is a case where a suspe ct buckled under the pressure that Andy put on him. Diane says, “Did you  make any threats?” A “threat” (threat) is when you tell someone that if he doesn’t do what you want him to do, you will do something bad to him. You will c ause him injury or pain or something else that will make him change his mind.

 Andy says, “Of course I made threats.” He says, “It ’s an interrogation, not a tea party.” An “interrogation” (interrogation) is usual ly something that the police do with a suspect. They bring the suspect to the polic e station and they “interrogate” him. They ask him questions to see if he did anythi ng wrong, or to get information from the person. In other countries, military servi ces might also interrogate someone who is from another country, an enemy count ry.

A “tea (tea) party” is, literally, a social gatheri ng, a small party you have with friends at which you would drink tea and have perha ps little pieces of cake. “Tea parties” are much more common in countries outside of the United States. We might think of Great Britain, for example, where th ey have afternoon tea. A tea party would be a little more formal of an event. the idea in this expression, however, is that a tea party is a nice, friendly ge t-together, whereas an interrogation is not. That’s why Andy says, “It’s a n interrogation, not a tea party.” We were not there to have fun.

Diane, however, says, “The confession is no good if  it’s coerced.” The verb “to coerce” (coerce) means to force someone to do somet hing or say something often because you are threatening that person with some sort of pain or harm. Andy says, “I may have gone over the line a little,  but who’s to know?” Diane says the confession is no good, meaning the police can’t use it, if it was “coerced” from the suspect – if Andy did something to force the suspect to confess.

Andy says he may have “gone over the line” (line). The expression “to go over the line” means to do more than what you should do,  or to do more than what is acceptable. In this case, he may have coerced the s uspect, making the confession no good. Andy says, “I may have gone ove r the line” – it was possible, that is – “but who’s to know,” meaning no  one will know if we don’t tell anyone. Diane says, “He knows” – the suspect knows – “and any half-decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of that confession.”  “Half-decent” means pretty good – someone who is not the best but good enough.

Diane is saying that even a lawyer who isn’t very g ood “will make mincemeat out of that confession.” “To make mincemeat (mincemeat)  out of” something is to destroy it, to defeat it. We often use this express ion in talking about defeating someone’s argument or making someone’s argument loo k to be incorrect. It might also be used in the sense of physically attac king another person. “That six- foot-five man will make mincemeat out of anyone who  tries to fight him.”

The verb “to mince” (mince) in this case means to c hop up or to break up into smaller pieces. “Minced meat,” then, is chopped-up beef. I think in American English we would probably call it something like “g round beef.” In British English, it’s more likely to be called “minced meat” or “min cemeat.” Although, just to make things even more confusing, there is actually a dis h – it’s a kind of pie – called “mincemeat pie” which doesn’t have any beef in it. It’s sweet. It’s made with things like raisins. That’s a British food that is eaten often during Christmastime. But back to our story . . .

Diane says the suspect will get the confession “thr own out in court in a heartbeat” – or I guess, technically, the lawyer will get it “ thrown out of court.” To have something “thrown out of court” (court) means to ha ve a judge say that it can’t be used against the person in a criminal or any other kind of legal trial. So, if evidence is “thrown out of court,” the judge says n o, you cannot use that particular piece of evidence against this person – perhaps because, as in this case, it was gathered illegally.

There are rules about how you can get information t hat will be used against a person in a trial, and using “coercion” to get a co nfession breaks one of those rules, so the judge will “throw it out of court.” D iane says the confession will get “thrown out of court in a heartbeat” (heartbeat). “ In a heartbeat” means very quickly. The verb “to beat” is used to describe the  motion that your heart goes through when it pumps, and of course, your heart pu mps many times a minute, so it’s a very short amount of time. “In a heartbea t,” then, means quickly.

Andy says, “I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s  not like I put the screws on him.” “To lean (lean) on” someone can mean a couple of di fferent things. Here it means to try to influence or coerce someone. “To le an on” can also mean to get support from another person, so it has, in many way s, two opposite meanings. “To lean on” means in this case to pressure someone , but you could also say, “I lean on my friend.” He helps me. He supports me. “T o put the screws (screws) on” someone means the same thing as “to coerce” som eone – to force someone to do something by threatening that person.

Diane just says, “You have a lot to learn,” meaning  Andy is still not very good at what he does. Andy says, “Do you think I should go back in there and talk to him?” Diane says, “Stay out of there. You’ve done e nough damage,” meaning you’ve already made the situation bad enough. I don ’t want you going in there and making it worse. Then she ends our dialogue by saying, “Rookies!”

A “rookie” (rookie) is a person who is just startin g to work in a certain area or field. We talk about “rookie players” on a team, on  a professional baseball team.

These are players that are just starting. It’s thei r first year. New police officers who don’t have a lot of experience are sometimes ca lled “rookies” or “rookie cops,” and that’s the case with Andy. He obviously doesn’t have very much experience being a police officer yet.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: I got it! I got a confession.

Diane: You got a confession out of that suspect? Ho w did you do it? We’ve been after that guy for days.

Andy: I put the pressure on and he buckled.

Diane: Did you make threats?

Andy: Of course I made threats. It’s an interrogati on, not a tea party.

Diane: The confession is no good if it’s coerced.

Andy: I may have gone over the line a little, but w ho’s to know?

Diane: He knows and any half-decent lawyer will mak e mincemeat out of that confession. He’ll get it thrown out of court in a h eartbeat.

Andy: I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s not l ike I put the screws on him.

Diane: You have a lot to learn.

Andy: Do you think I should go back in there and ta lk to him?

Diane: Stay out of there. You’ve done enough damage . Rookies!

# Reneging on a Promise

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,252 – Reneging on a Promise.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,252. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store with some additional courses in business, daily, and cultural  English we think you’ll enjoy.

This episode is a dialogue between Jean-Paul and Ch arlene about someone who says he’s going to do something, who promises to do  something, and then doesn’t. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jean-Paul: What’s going on? I thought it was a done  deal.

Charlene: I think you misunderstood. The last time we talked, I said I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going  to beg off.

Jean-Paul: What you said was that you were agreeabl e to the idea and that we would work out the details later. Now you’re backtr acking?

Charlene: I would never renege on a promise. If I g ave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.

Jean-Paul: I’m really surprised by your denial. I d idn’t have you pegged as someone who backs out of deals.

Charlene: All I can say is that we don’t see eye to  eye. Let’s agree to disagree and leave it at that.

Jean-Paul: That’s easy for you to say. Your failure  to honor your promise is going to put me in a very awkward position.

Charlene: How’s that? We only spoke yesterday.

Jean-Paul: I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.

 Charlene: May I make a suggestion?

Jean-Paul: What? Deny, deny, deny?

Charlene: Well, it’s worked for me.

Jean-Paul: Oh, the nerve of some people!

[end of dialogue]

Jean-Paul begins our dialogue by asking Charlene, “ What’s going on?” This is a question that could mean a couple of different thin gs, depending on how you ask it. “What’s going on?” means “What is happening?” If yo u say it to a friend of yours, it may just mean “How are you?” “How are things?” “ What’s new in your life?” But if you say it to someone with a certain intonation,  such as “What’s going on?” then you are asking about a problem. You are asking  for the reason why something is not going well, perhaps.

Jean-Paul uses this second meaning of the expressio n. He is clearly confused about what is happening. He says, “I thought it was  a done deal.” We don’t know what “it” was. Obviously some sort of agreement. A “done deal” (deal) is something that you have agreed to, something that h as been decided upon and about which you don’t expect there to be any change s. A “done deal” is something that has been “finalized,” we might say –  some agreement that everyone has already approved.

Charlene says, however, “I think you misunderstood. ” Charlene is telling Jean- Paul that it wasn’t a done deal – that they had not  finished their discussions about whatever this agreement was. Charlene continu es, “The last time we talked,” meaning the previous time we talked, “I sa id I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going to be g off.” “To partner (partner) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree to work  with another person – to make that person your partner, the person you work with.

Charlene says she was thinking about becoming Jean- Paul’s partner, presumably his business partner, but now that she h as thought about it more, she says she’s going “to beg (beg) off (off).” “To beg off” means to decide not to do what you were going to do. You’re asking, in a s ense, to be excused from some promise or commitment you made, or perhaps you  are simply changing your mind about what you want to do. Normally “to b eg” someone means to ask

something from that person. Here the idea is that y ou are asking the permission, perhaps, of that person to not do what you said you  were going to do.

Jean-Paul is not very happy. He says, “What you sai d was” – meaning the last time we spoke, you told me – “that you were agreeab le to the idea and that we would work out the details later.” “To be agreeable  (agreeable) to” something means that you like the idea, that you are okay wit h supporting it. You think it is a good thing. Jean-Paul says that Charlene was “agree able to the idea” of being his partner, and that he and Charlene “would work o ut the details later,” meaning they would figure out the specifics of their agreem ent later on.

“Now,” Jean-Paul says, Charlene is “backtracking.” “To backtrack” (backtrack) means to change your mind about what you had alread y agreed to, to try to undo or reverse what has already been done. If you say y ou are going to buy something for 10 dollars, and then 10 minutes later  you say, “No, I don’t think I will. I’ll only pay five dollars,” you are backtrac king. You are trying to go back on, or to change your mind about, something you have al ready promised to do. Charlene, however, disagrees. She says, “I would ne ver renege on a promise.”

“To renege (renege) on” something is to not do what  you have promised to do. It’s to break a deal or to break a commitment. Char lene says, “If I gave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.” “T o give your word” to someone means to make a promise to someone. The idea, howev er, when you say “I give you my word” is that it is something personal – tha t even though you are not signing a piece of paper, you are making this promi se to the person even without a contract, just “on your word,” just based on your  words that are spoken.

However, Charlene says that she didn’t give her wor d. If she had, however, she would have followed through. “To follow through” (t hrough) means to do what you say you were going to do, to keep your promise. Jea n-Paul says, “I’m really surprised by your denial.” A “denial” (denial) is w hen you say no to someone or when you say that something didn’t happen. If someo ne says, “I saw you last night with someone other than your girlfriend,” and  you say, “No, that wasn’t me,” that’s a denial. You’re saying no, it wasn’t true. Charlene is saying that she did not give her word to Jean-Paul. That’s a denial.

Jean-Paul says, “I didn’t have you pegged as someon e who backs out of deals.” “To have someone pegged” (pegged) as a certain thin g is to believe that someone has certain characteristics. If someone say s, “I didn’t have you pegged as a beer drinker,” that person means that he didn’ t think you were the kind of person who drank beer. Jean-Paul says he didn’t thi nk that Charlene was the

kind of person who “backs out of” deals. “To back o ut of” something is to break a promise, to renege on a promise or commitment.

Charlene says, “All I can say is that we don’t see eye to eye.” “All I can say” means “The only thing I can tell you at this point”  is that we don’t see eye to eye. “To see eye (eye) to eye” means simply to agree wit h another person, to think the same as another person, or to come to an agreem ent with another person. That’s why she says, “Let’s just agree to disagree and leave it at that.” The expression “to agree to disagree” means you are not  going to come to an agreement, but you’re not going to fight about it a nymore either. You’re going to stop arguing about it or trying to come to an agree ment.

So, if two people have different political opinions  and they discuss those opinions, at the end of their discussion they may s ay, “Well, let’s agree to disagree.” In other words, we don’t agree on anythi ng about politics, so we’ll just stop arguing now. That’s also what Charlene means b y the expression “to leave it at that.” “To leave it at that” means to stop your conversation even though you have not yet come to an agreement.

Jean-Paul says, “That’s easy for you to say,” meani ng that’s easy for you but not easy for me. “Your failure to honor your promise is  going to put me in a very awkward position,” he says. “Failure (failure) to h onor (honor) a promise” means the same as to renege on your promise – not to do w hat you said you were going to do. Jean-Paul thinks that Charlene has failed to  honor her promise, and this is going to put him or place him in a “very awkward (a wkward) position.” An “awkward position” would be a situation that would be difficult for you, that would make things hard for you.

Charlene doesn’t understand. She says, “How’s that? ” meaning please explain what you mean. “We only spoke yesterday,” she says.  Jean-Paul responds, “I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.” “To get out of” something means to find a  way not to have to do what you said you were going to do – in other words, to renege on a commitment. So what happened here was that Jean-Paul went and made  some promises to other people based on what Charlene had promised to him.

Charlene says, “May I make a suggestion?” Jean-Paul  says, “What? Deny, deny, deny?” In other words, Charlene is suggesting that he do to others what Charlene did to him – simply lie and say that he ne ver made those promises. Charlene is saying “Yes, that’s what I just did. I basically lied. I denied that I had made a promise to you.”

Jean-Paul obviously is not very happy at this point , after Charlene now admits – she now says that basically she lied to him. He say s, “The nerve of some people!” The expression “the nerve (nerve) of some people” is used to express your frustration at someone else’s behavior – your shock and disapproval of the way someone else is acting, especially towards you.  Jean-Paul is saying that he can’t believe how much of a liar Charlene is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jean-Paul: What’s going on? I thought it was a done  deal.

Charlene: I think you misunderstood. The last time we talked, I said I would think about partnering up, but now that I have, I’m going  to beg off.

Jean-Paul: What you said was that you were agreeabl e to the idea and that we would work out the details later. Now you’re backtr acking?

Charlene: I would never renege on a promise. If I g ave my word, I would follow through. In this case, I didn’t.

Jean-Paul: I’m really surprised by your denial. I d idn’t have you pegged as someone who backs out of deals.

Charlene: All I can say is that we don’t see eye to  eye. Let’s agree to disagree and leave it at that.

Jean-Paul: That’s easy for you to say. Your failure  to honor your promise is going to put me in a very awkward position.

Charlene: How’s that? We only spoke yesterday.

Jean-Paul: I may have made some promises of my own and now I’ll have to get out of them somehow.

Charlene: May I make a suggestion?

Jean-Paul: What? Deny, deny, deny?

Charlene: Well, it’s worked for me.

 Jean-Paul: Oh, the nerve of some people!

This episode is a dialogue between Carl and Doris a bout ridesharing services – businesses that allow you to take a taxi without ta king a taxi. I’ll explain when we get to the explanation. For now, let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Let’s get a taxi.

Doris: There’s no need. I’ve already ordered a car.

Carl: A limo? That’s too expensive.

Doris: No, I’m using a ridesharing service. It’s ch eaper than a taxi. There’s no meter and we pay a set price.

Carl: But how do we know it’s safe? How do we know the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver? Is he going to have car insurance ? Do they do background checks?

Doris: Even though it’s a peer-to-peer service, the  drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This ride will be safe.

Carl: We don’t have much cash on us.

Doris: I have a credit card on file. No cash will c hange hands. Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Michael.

Carl: You know our driver?

Doris: He’s my son.

 Carl: But why are you paying for a ride if your son  is available to pick us up?

Doris: He has his pride. He won’t take any money fr om me so we came up with a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride t o or from the airport. It works for us and there’s a bonus.

Carl: What’s that?

Doris: I get to see my son every time I travel.

Carl: That seems like a strange arrangement.

Doris: That may be so, but if you can’t get your so n to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Carl saying to Doris, “Let ’s get a taxi.” A “taxi” (taxi) is a “taxicab” – a car that you can ride in and pay mone y to take you from one place to another. Doris says, “There’s no need,” meaning we don’t have to get a taxi. She says, “I’ve already ordered a car.” She has alr eady arranged for them to be taken from where they are now to where they want to  go, but not in a taxi.

A “taxi” is a car that, in many cities, you can sim ply wave your hand at and it will stop and allow you to get in and take you to where you want to go. In some cities, like Los Angeles, you actually have to call to get a taxi or to go to a place where there are already taxis waiting for you, called a “ taxi stand” (stand). Taxi stands in Los Angeles can be found at the airport as well as in front of some big hotels.

However, one way of getting from where you want to go is, instead of calling a taxi, to call for a limo. A “limo” (limo) is a “lim ousine,” which is a very nice car, often a very long car, that is more comfortable tha n a taxi. In Los Angeles, you can call for a taxi or you can call and get a limo to come and pick you up from your house. “Limos,” or “limousines,” are more expe nsive. That’s why Carl says, “A limo? That’s too expensive.”

Doris didn’t say she ordered a limo. She said she o rdered a car. Until recently, if someone said they “ordered a car,” you would think that they had ordered a limo. But nowadays you can order a car that’s not a limo.  Doris explains – she says, “I’m using a ridesharing service.” “Ridesharing” (r idesharing) is a service where

people who don’t have a taxi license, who are just regular people who own cars, will give you a ride and you pay them for that ride .

“It’s cheaper than a taxi,” Doris explains, which it is. If you use one of these ridesharing services, you call them up or go on you r phone with an app and order a car to come and pick you up. Someone drives his o wn car, picks you up, and takes you to where you want to go. Doris says, “The re’s no meter and we pay a set price.” A “meter” (meter) here refers to a mach ine, a device, that calculates or figures out how much you have to pay your taxi driv er.

Taxi drivers in most cities use meters. So, they tu rn the meter on when you get into the taxi and turn it off when you arrive at your destination, or the place you are going to. Then that machine tells both of you h ow much money you need to give to the taxi driver. But in a ridesharing servi ce, there is no meter. Instead, you pay a “set (set) price.” A “set price” is an amount  of money that doesn’t change depending on how far you go.

Actually, ridesharing services do charge you depend ing on the distance between where you are now and where you want to go, but it isn’t exactly based on the number of miles or minutes it takes. So, it’s sort of a “set price.” It’s a set price before you start taking the trip. In a taxi, you of ten get charged for time that the taxi has to “sit in traffic,” we would say. So, if there are a lot of cars on the road and it takes the taxi a long time to get there, you  might have to pay more. That’s probably the biggest difference in terms of a taxi and a ridesharing service, for price.

Carl asks Doris, “How do we know it’s safe?” meanin g “How do we know this ridesharing service is safe?” “How do we know,” he continues, “the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver?” A “criminal” (crimin al) is a person who has broken the law, who has done something against the law. An  “unsafe driver” would be a driver who is not safe – who is dangerous, perhaps.  “Is he going to have car insurance?” Carl asks. “Car insurance” (insurance) is an agreement you have with an insurance company that says that if you get  into an accident, the insurance company will pay for all or some of the d amage caused.

Carl also asks, “Do they,” meaning the ridesharing services, “do background checks?” A “background check” (check) is when a com pany looks at your government records or other information to make sur e that you have not committed a crime in the past. Background checks are quite common now when people are hired by companies or by the government.  You can check to make sure the person hasn’t committed a crime before you  hire him. Carl is worried

that the driver might be a criminal – the driver of  the car they get from the ridesharing service, that is.

Doris says, “Even though it’s a peer-to-peer servic e, the drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This r ide will be safe.” “Peer” (peer) refers to someone who is at the same level or who i s in the same category as you are. We often use the word “peers” to refer to those people who have the same kind of job as we have. I might refer to my “p eers at the university” – people who work in jobs similar to my job, although  I no longer work at the university anymore.

“Peer-to-peer,” however, refers to a new kind of, w e would say, “business model” in which people sell their services to other people  even when they aren’t professionals. So, in a ridesharing service, I may own a car and give you a ride even though I’m not a professional driver, and char ge you money to give you that ride. That’s an example of a “peer-to-peer transact ion” or a “peer-to-peer exchange” of money and service.

The drivers, according to Doris, “are carefully scr eened.” “To screen” (screen) here means to review or check someone to make sure that he is qualified, that he meets your requirements. If cars are “tracked” ( tracked), they are being monitored or followed so that someone knows the loc ation of that car, someone knows where that car is.

Carl says, “We don’t have much cash on us,” meaning  we don’t have a lot of dollar bills or coins with us. Doris says, “I have a credit card on file. No cash will change hands.” A “credit card on file” (file) means  that you have your credit card information in a computer database or in the system  of the company that runs the ridesharing service. If you order things from a web site like Amazon.com, you may have your credit card “on file,” meaning when you b uy something you don’t have to put your credit card information into the system  again. It already has that information. It is already on file.

Doris says, “No cash will change hands.” “To change  hands” here simply means that one person gives something to another person i n exchange for money or some other object. So, if we say “money changed han ds,” we mean I gave money to someone who gave me something back. It’s j ust another way of saying “to pay for something” – in this case, with cash. T hat’s why Doris says, “No cash will change hands,” meaning we don’t have to give h im dollar bills – we can simply use our credit card.

Then she says, “Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Mic hael.” Carl says, “You know our driver?” He’s surprised that Doris knows who Mi chael is. Doris says, “He’s my son.” Carl says, “But why are you paying for a r ide if your son is available to pick us up?” I think this is a good question. Doris  doesn’t really have a good answer. She says, “He has his pride” (pride). “Prid e” here refers to one’s feeling of self-respect or self-worth – that what you do is  worth something.

“He won’t take any money from me so we came up with  a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride to or from the airport.”  So Doris and her son have an arrangement. He doesn’t like taking money directly from Doris, from his mother – I mean, what son would ask his mother to give him m oney to give him a ride? So instead, Doris says that they “came up with,” or th ey found, “a compromise” (compromise).

A “compromise” is an agreement between two people o r two groups of people in which each person or group gives something to the o ther. They reach an agreement to exchange something. In this case, Dori s and her son have a compromise. She won’t give him money directly. She will give the money to the ridesharing service who will then give that money –  or part of that money, really – to her son, Michael. It sounds like a pretty dumb a rrangement to me, but that’s what Doris and her son have come up with.

She says, “I hire (hire) his car.” “To hire” here m eans to arrange to use or to be transported in his car. She says, “It works for us and there’s a bonus.” A “bonus” (bonus) is some additional benefit, some additional  thing you get in addition to the main benefit. Carl says, “What’s that?” Doris s ays, “I get to see my son every time I travel.”

Carl says, rightly, “That seems like a strange arra ngement,” meaning a strange agreement that you two have, or a strange, unusual situation to be in. Doris says, “That may be so,” meaning maybe you’re right, “but if you can’t get your son to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?” Doris is saying that because her son won’t come and visit her, she has this arrangement.  She doesn’t know what else she can do.

That’s what she means by that final expression, “Wh at’s a mother to do?” You could say, “What’s a father to do?” or “What’s a br other to do?” or “What’s a boss to do?” The form of the expression – “What’s a (som eone) to do?” – means you don’t have any other options or any other choices. This is the only thing you can do. Doris thinks the only way she can see her son i s to pay to have him take her to the airport.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Let’s get a taxi.

Doris: There’s no need. I’ve already ordered a car.

Carl: A limo? That’s too expensive.

Doris: No, I’m using a ridesharing service. It’s ch eaper than a taxi. There’s no meter and we pay a set price.

Carl: But how do we know it’s safe? How do we know the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver? Is he going to have car insurance ? Do they do background checks?

Doris: Even though it’s a peer-to-peer service, the  drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This ride will be safe.

Carl: We don’t have much cash on us.

Doris: I have a credit card on file. No cash will c hange hands. Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Michael.

Carl: You know our driver?

Doris: He’s my son.

Carl: But why are you paying for a ride if your son  is available to pick us up?

Doris: He has his pride. He won’t take any money fr om me so we came up with a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride t o or from the airport. It works for us and there’s a bonus.

Carl: What’s that?

Doris: I get to see my son every time I travel.

Carl: That seems like a strange arrangement.

 Doris: That may be so, but if you can’t get your so n to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?

This episode is a dialogue between Ann and Elio abo ut being influenced by people whose behavior, whose actions, are not alway s very good. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I don’t like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting his mind.

Elio: I don’t like it either, but he’s old enough t o read and watch what he likes without our interference.

Ann: But they’re brainwashing him! Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.

Elio: They’re certainly blasphemous and profane. I agree with you. But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-liv ed.

Ann: Even if he loses interest, we’ll have to find a way to reverse the damage that’s been done. He’ll need to be deprogramed.

Elio: Maybe their effect will be short-lived, too. Deep down he’s a good kid. We both know that.

Ann: Yes, but those ideas are dangerous. I hope he doesn’t act on them.

Elio: Don’t even think it. That would spell disaste r.

Ann: All right, I’ll only think good thoughts.

 Elio: Good.

Ann: Where are you going?

Elio: I’m hoping for the best, but just in case, it  doesn’t hurt to monitor what he’s saying on social media.

[end of dialogue]

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Elio, “I don’t  like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting h is mind.” “To corrupt” (corrupt) can have several different meanings. Here  it refers to changing a person’s behavior – the way a person acts in a nega tive way, to influence someone so that he starts acting dishonestly, perha ps, or in a way that we don’t approve of.

Elio says, “I don’t like it either, but he’s old en ough to read and watch what he likes without our interference.” “Interference” (in terference) is used to describe a situation where someone is getting in our way or ge tting involved in our affairs, in our actions, in a way that we don’t want. The verb is “to interfere.” So, “interference” is when someone does something that either prevents someone from doing what he wants or changes what someone do es in a way that that person isn’t very happy about. Elio doesn’t think t hat he and Ann can interfere in their son’s reading and film-watching.

Ann says, “But they’re brainwashing him!” “To brain wash” (brainwash) means to use some method of influencing the way someone thin ks, usually in such a way that the person loses their own ability to think for himself. We usually associate “brainwashing” with some sort of political or relig ious leader who is making his followers, the people who believe in him, do things  that they would not otherwise do. It’s always used in a negative sense – that is,  we use the verb “to brainwash” when we are referring to someone who is influencing  other people to believe things they would not otherwise believe on their ow n.

Ann says, “Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.” “Evil” (evil) is the opposite of good. It means very bad, and is oft en used to refer to things that are perhaps the worst cases of some sort of ethical  or moral “badness,” you might say. There is often a religious meaning to the word “evil.” “Perverted (perverted) refers to something that is unnatural, or we might say “abnormal” (abnormal). “Abnormal” is not normal, not usual. “P erverted” is often an adjective used to refer to sexual actions or sexual desires t hat are considered abnormal.

 Elio says that these books “are certainly blasphemo us and profane.” “I agree with you,” he says. “Blasphemous” (blasphemous) is an ad jective used to describe something someone says against God or against relig ion in a very, I guess we would say, disrespectful way – in a not nice way. “ Profane” (profane) can mean simply the opposite of “sacred” (sacred). “Sacred” refers to things related to God, and “profane” would refer to things related to huma n beings.

However, it also has another meaning which means the same as or something similar to “blasphemous,” which is not respectful of religion or religious teachings. “Blasphemous” usually refers to things said against  God as a being, whereas “profane,” when it’s used in the negative sense, is  something that is said against religion or religious teachings that, of course, are related to God in most belief systems. Elio says, “But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-lived.”

Elio isn’t sure what he and his wife can do about t heir son’s interest in these books. He says, “Maybe his interest in them will be  short (short) – lived (lived).” “Short-lived” means lasting or going on for a very short amount of time – temporary. Ann says, “Even if he loses interest, we ’ll have to find a way to reverse the damage that’s been done.” “To lose (los e) interest” in something is to no longer want to know more about it or no longer want to be involved with it. “To reverse” (reverse) can mean to go in the opposite d irection – to go backwards instead of forwards, for example.

“Damage” (damage) is some negative effect on a pers on or a thing. “To reverse the damage” would be to take something that has bee n hurt or harmed and make it better again or return it to its previous health y condition or state. Ann thinks their son may need to be “deprogramed.” “To deprogr am” (deprogram) means to take someone who has been brainwashed, who has been  convinced to believe things that he would not otherwise believe, and ret urn that person to his original way of thinking – to reverse the damage of brainwas hing, you could think of it as.

These terms, “brainwashing” and “deprogramming,” we re quite popular, or at least you would hear them more often, in the 1960s and ’70s when, at least in the United States, there was a lot of news stories abou t “cults” (cults). “Cults” are usually religious groups that have beliefs and prac tices that are very different than the normal accepted common religious groups. You don’t hear people talking about “deprograming” as much anymore. In an y case, Elio says, “Maybe their effect will be short-lived, too.” “Effect” he re means result or consequence.

He says, “Deep down he’s a good kid.” “Deep down” i s an expression we use to refer to something that is part of someone’s nature , or something that someone has even though it doesn’t look as though they have  it. For example, we may describe someone as being “honest deep down” even t hough right now the person is lying or being dishonest. “Deep down” mig ht also be used to describe what someone really believes or truly believes even  though the person seems to be saying something different right now.

Ann says, “Those ideas are dangerous. I hope he doe sn’t act on them.” “To act (act) on” something is to take something you believ e and do something about it – to actually change your behavior based on something  you think or believe in. Elio says, “Don’t even think it. That would spell disast er.” “To spell (spell) disaster (disaster)” means to have a very bad result or to c reate a very big problem. Ann says, “All right, I’ll only think good thoughts.” E lio says, “Good.”

Then Ann says, “Where are you going?” Elio responds , “I’m hoping for the best” – meaning, in this case, I hope our son is okay – “ but just in case,” meaning if I am wrong about that, “it doesn’t hurt to monitor wh at he’s saying on social media.” “To monitor” (monitor) means to observe and  watch something, especially when you are trying to make sure that no thing bad happens to that thing or even to that person. When you are in the h ospital, the doctors and nurses will “monitor” your heartbeat, or perhaps your breathing, to make sure that nothing bad is happening to you.

“Social media” refers to websites and services onli ne such as Facebook and Twitter, where people share their thoughts and phot os with other people. “Social” refers to being part of a group, and “media” refers  to ways of communicating or ways of transferring information or giving informat ion, including photographs and movies, to other people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I don’t like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting his mind.

Elio: I don’t like it either, but he’s old enough t o read and watch what he likes without our interference.

Ann: But they’re brainwashing him! Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.

 Elio: They’re certainly blasphemous and profane. I agree with you. But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-liv ed.

# Talking About Gemstones

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,255 – Talking about Gemstones.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,255. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store with additional courses in business and daily English. This episode  is all about something called a “gemstone,” which is a shiny or colorful piece of  crystal. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nathan: I’m looking for a gift for my girlfriend. C an you help me pick something out?

Ellie: I’d be happy to. We have a wide selection of  jewelry with precious and semiprecious gemstones. Are you interested in somet hing new or antique?

Nathan: I’m not sure. I’m just looking for somethin g nice, something that really reflects our relationship.

Ellie: I understand. Let me show you some of our fi nest pieces. This ring has a polished faceted stone that has a lot of luster. Is n’t it exquisite?

Nathan: That’s beautiful, but it’s not really what I’m looking for.

Ellie: No problem. How about this piece? It has a l ovely color and cut and it’s in a gold setting.

Nathan: Gold, huh? “Golden” isn’t how I’d describe our relationship, at least not yet.

Ellie: Okay, many of our semiprecious stones are se t in silver. This one is really radiant, don’t you think?

Nathan: That’s okay, but what about these stones ov er here?

Ellie: Those are rough uncut stones. They need a lo t of work before they’re ready for sale.

 Nathan: Rough and needs work? That describes our re lationship to a tee. I’ll take one of those.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking today about “gemstones” (gemstones). The easiest way to define a gemstone is to give you some examples. Examples of gemstones include diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds – these are a ll colorful and/or shiny pieces of what are technically “mineral crystals” t hat you find, of course, in the ground usually. Nathan begins our dialogue by sayin g, “I’m looking for a gift for my girlfriend.” He’s asking Ellie, the woman who wo rks at the jewelry store, to help him pick something out. “To pick out” somethin g or “to pick something out” means to select something from among several option s or choices.

Ellie says, “I’d be happy to,” meaning I would be h appy to help you. Of course, people who work at a store should be happy to help you. They are, of course, selling something to you. Ellie says, “We have a wi de selection,” meaning we have many different kinds, “of jewelry with preciou s and semiprecious gemstones.” There are two kinds of gemstones. “Prec ious” (precious) are the more expensive ones. Those are things like the exam ples I just gave you – diamonds and rubies and sapphires.

The less expensive ones – the cheaper ones, the one s I buy – are called “semiprecious” (semiprecious). “Semiprecious” means  that they are not as expensive. They’re often made from other kinds of r ock or what are called “organic materials.” The difference is mostly comme rcial, I think, more than it is geological. In any case, a “semiprecious gemstone” would be something such as jade, jasper, agate, amethyst – those sorts of ston es are considered semiprecious. Topaz and turquoise would be another couple of examples. Ellie is saying that they have both precious and semipreciou s gemstones.

She asks, “Are you interested in something new or a ntique?” “Antique” (antique) is sometimes defined as an object that is at least 100 years old, though it is often used simply to mean very old, with no specific refe rence to how old it is. Nathan says, “I’m not sure. I’m just looking for something  nice, something that really reflects our relationship.” “To reflect” means to r epresent or perhaps to symbolize. Ellie says, “I understand. Let me show y ou some of our finest pieces.” Now, the word “finest” here means highest quality –  best and probably most expensive.

She says, “This ring has a polished faceted stone t hat has a lot of luster.” “Polished” (polished) refers to something having be en rubbed with a cloth or some piece of material so that it is shiny, so that  you can sometimes even see your reflection on it. If you have an old piece of silver that has been sitting in your drawer for many years, it will probably need to be polished. You’ll need to do something so that it looks shiny again, so that it looks bright again.

“Faceted” (faceted) refers to something having many  sides, or many aspects, if we’re using it more metaphorically. Here it refers to an actual stone that has many different sides to it. “Luster” (luster) refer s to the shine of light that is reflected by something. It’s an adjective usually u sed to talk about jewelry or things like silver. Don’t confuse “luster” with “lu st” (lust). “Lust” is sexual desire. We’re not talking about that here. We’re talking ab out something very different.

Ellie says, “Isn’t it exquisite (exquisite)?” “Exqu isite” is an adjective used to describe something that is very beautiful, that is very, we might say, “refined” or “elegant.” We might describe a beautiful diamond as  being “exquisite.” It means it’s very, very beautiful. Nathan says, “That’s bea utiful, but it’s not really what I’m looking for.” Ellie says, “No problem” – okay, in o ther words. “How about this piece?” She shows him another piece of jewelry. “It  has a lovely color and cut and it’s in a gold setting.” A “cut” (cut) refers t o the way that a stone or a crystal is cut by a jeweler, a person who works with stones an d jewels.

Diamonds in particular have different cuts, and the  different cuts make the diamond look different. The light is reflected diff erently depending on the cut of the diamond. If you’ve ever bought a ring for your wife or girlfriend, you know what I’m talking about. Ellie mentions this particu lar stone is in a “gold setting.” “Gold” (gold) is a kind of metal. It’s often referr ed to as a “precious metal,” just like “precious stone.” A precious metal is a more e xpensive, a rarer, metal.

A “setting” (setting) refers to where the stone is placed in the piece of jewelry. For example, you could have the diamond in a ring, or y ou could have it on something you would wear around your neck called a “pendant.” Those are different “settings.” This is in a “gold setting,” meaning the metal of the ring or the pendant is gold. Nathan says, “Gold, huh?” He’s a l ittle surprised, or perhaps confused.

He then says something sort of odd. He says, “‘Gold en’ isn’t how I’d describe our relationship, at least not yet.” “Golden” (golden) is the adjective related to gold. Here it means very nice or even perhaps perfect. We  talk about California being the “Golden State” because it is where gold was dis covered many years ago.

“Golden” more generally can refer to something that  is ideal or something that is valuable.

Nathan says his relationship with his girlfriend is n’t yet golden, meaning perhaps he doesn’t want to spend that much money on her yet . Ellie says, “Okay, many of our semiprecious stones are set in silver” (silver) . Silver is a white metal – chemical element Ag for those of you who are chemis ts. Silver is expensive, but less expensive than gold. It’s cheaper than gold, u sually.

Ellie says, “This one,” showing him another piece of jewelry, “This one is really radiant, don’t you think?” “Radiant” (radiant) refe rs to something that seems to be producing light. Of course, a stone doesn’t actuall y produce light. It doesn’t “emit” light, we would say. It “reflects” light. But somet hing that is very shiny might be described as something that is “radiant.” We might describe a beautiful woman as being “radiant,” meaning she’s so beautiful, it’ s almost as though light were coming out of her.

Nathan doesn’t seem to like what Ellie is showing h im. He says, “That’s okay, but what about these stones over here?” He’s pointing t o some other part of the store. Ellie says, “Those are rough uncut stones.” “Uncut” means the jeweler, the person who works with the stones, hasn’t done anyth ing to them yet, hasn’t cut them so that they look nice. The word “rough” (roug h) also refers to something as it is when it was found in the ground.

“Rough” might also be the opposite of “polished.” S omething that is rough is something that is not very refined. “Rough” is also  sometimes used as the opposite of “smooth” (smooth). A “smooth road” or a  “smooth street” is one you can drive down without feeling any bumps. The oppos ite of that would be “rough,” where your car would go up and down becaus e there are holes in the street. We’re talking about “rough uncut stones,” o r rocks.

Ellie says the rough uncut stones “need a lot of wo rk before they’re ready for sale.” In other words, they’re not quite ready yet to be sold. Nathan says, “Rough and needs work? That describes our relationship to a tee. I’ll take one of those.” Remember, Nathan was looking for a stone or a gemst one that reflected his and his girlfriend’s relationship, and apparently it ne eds work. That’s why he says that the rough uncut stones describe their relationship “to a tee” (tee).

“To a tee” is an expression that means perfectly, e xactly, precisely. There’s some discussion about whether it should just be the lett er “T.” I think you would see it most often spelled out: (tee). No one is quite sure  why we say “to a tee,” but everyone understands it means exactly or precisely or perfectly. We often use

the expression in referring to a piece of clothing – “It fits me to a tee,” meaning it fits me perfectly. It’s the exact size for me.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nathan: I’m looking for a gift for my girlfriend. C an you help me pick something out?

Ellie: I’d be happy to. We have a wide selection of  jewelry with precious and semiprecious gemstones. Are you interested in somet hing new or antique?

# Describing Fast and Slow Speech

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,256 – Describing Fast and Slow Speech.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,256. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and become a member of ESL Podcast . When you do, you can get all of our great episodes with the Learning  Guides as well.

This episode is a dialogue between Jerome and Elise  about speaking fast and slow. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: Did you hear what the speaker said?

Elise: No, I didn’t catch that either. She’s racing  through her presentation like she’s late for her train.

Jerome: I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of s peech that it’s dizzying. I wish she’d slow down so I could make out what she’s sayi ng. Most of it is mumbled or garbled.

Elise: She’s got to be breaking a record for the nu mber of words per minute. Hey wait, she’s done. The next speaker has to be better .

Jerome: Oh my God, she’s worse! She must be the slo west speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sentence seems int erminable. She just keeps droning on and on and on.

Elise: At least we can understand her.

Jerome: Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pace. She ’s making a lengthy speech even longer. At this rate, we’ll be here until midn ight!

Elise: Maybe we should try to pay attention and tak e notes like we’re supposed to.

Jerome: How can we when her voice is so hypnotic?

 Elise: I know what you mean. I think I need some co ffee. Do you want some?

Jerome: [snores]

Elise: Jerome, Jerome!

[end of dialogue]

Jerome says to Elise, “Did you hear what the speake r said?” A “speaker” (speaker) here refers to a person who is talking or  giving a speech in front of other people, in front of a group of people. The wo rd “speaker” can also refer to an electronic device that you hear sounds out of. S o, if you’re listening, for example, to the radio, you are probably listening t o the sound coming out of a speaker. You could also have headphones or ear buds  as well that go right into your ear. Jerome, however, is talking about a perso n who is speaking, who is talking.

Elise says, “No, I didn’t catch that either.” “To c atch” (catch) here means to understand or to recognize something, especially so mething that is being told to you. If you have difficulty hearing someone, you ma y say, “I didn’t catch that,” meaning I didn’t understand it or I didn’t hear it properly. Elise isn’t able to understand what the speaker is saying either. She s ays, “She’s racing through her presentation like she’s late for her train.” “T o race” (race) means to do something very quickly, very fast. Elise is saying that the speaker is talking very fast.

She’s “racing through her presentation” – the infor mation she’s giving to people – “like she’s late for her train.” If you are “late f or your train,” you may miss your train because you may arrive at the train station t oo late. So of course you’re going to move very quickly so you don’t miss your t rain. Well that’s what Elise is comparing the speaker to – a person who is moving v ery quickly. Jerome says, “I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of speech that  it’s dizzying.” Your “rate (rate) of speech” is how fast you talk. I’m talking  at a slow rate of speech right now, compared to how fast I might speak to someone else.

The rate of speech of the speaker, according to Jer ome, is “dizzying” (dizzying). Something that is “dizzying” makes you dizzy. “To b e dizzy” means to be confused. Usually you feel as though you may fall d own, or you feel, we would say, “disoriented.” If someone hits you on the head , you may feel dizzy. Your head might begin to seem as though it is spinning a round as though it is moving

around in circles. If something is “dizzying” becau se it’s fast, it is so fast it’s making you confused, and that’s what Jerome means h ere.

He says, “I wish she’d slow down,” meaning speak mo re slowly, “so I could make out what she’s saying.” “To make out” is a two-word  phrasal verb that here means to be able to understand something that is ot herwise unclear. “To make out” means to recognize or to understand something.  There’s another completely different meaning of the phrasal verb “to make out. ” In informal English, “to make out” means to kiss and otherwise touch someone to w hom you are romantically attracted. That’s a very different meaning than wha t we have here.

Jerome continues, “Most of it,” meaning most of wha t the speaker is saying, “is mumbled or garbled.” “Mumbled” (mumbled) means said  in a way that is difficult to understand. The verb “to mumble” is to say somet hing usually in a low voice – that is, not very loudly – and in a way that is dif ficult for other people to understand. Young children sometimes mumble. They s peak like: [mumbles]. They speak in a way that is opposite of the way I’m  speaking now, which is very clearly.

The same is true with the adjective “garbled” (garb led). “Garbled” means unclear or confusing. Often “garbled” means more specifical ly to be mixed up – perhaps two different people are talking at the same time, or there’s a lot of noise while someone is talking and so you can’t hear things cle arly. That’s a little different than “mumbled.” “Mumbled” refers specifically to so meone who is speaking at a low volume and not very clearly.

Elise continues, “She’s got to be breaking a record  for the number of words per minute.” “To break a record” here means to be doing  something, in this case, faster than anyone else has done it. A “record” (re cord) is the highest or greatest accomplishment that anyone has made in that particu lar area. In sports, we often talk about “world records” – the fastest person in the world, or the fastest that anyone has ever run. Well, Elise says that the spea ker is breaking a record for the “number of words per minute” – that is, the num ber of words that you speak each minute, each sixty seconds.

“Hey wait,” Elise says, “she’s done,” meaning she’s  finished. She’s completed her speech. “The next speaker has to be better,” El ise says. She means that the next speaker cannot be any worse than the one they just heard. But that isn’t true. Jerome says, “Oh my God, she’s worse. She mus t be the slowest speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sente nce seems interminable.” An “utterance” (utterance) is another word for somethi ng that is said or spoken.

Sometimes we think of an “utterance” as being a sen tence, although that’s not always true.

“To be drawn (drawn) – out” means to be made to las t longer than it should, to take more time than is necessary. Sometimes you’ll go to a movie and it will be very “drawn-out.” The story will be made much longe r than it needs to be. That’s usually a boring movie. “Every sentence seems inter minable” (interminable). Something which is “interminable” is something that  doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to end, something that is very long and usual ly very boring as well.

Jerome says, “She keeps droning on and on and on.” “To drone (drone) on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to speak for a very l ong time in a boring and uninteresting way. “I’m going to now talk about all  the things that I’m interested in. First, I will tell you about my first day at sc hool.” That’s “to drone on” – to talk for a long time in a way that isn’t very interestin g. Elise says, however, “At least we can understand her,” meaning well, even though s he’s boring, we can understand what she’s saying, which is unlike the p revious speaker.

Jerome says, “Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pac e” (pace). “To pick up the pace” is to increase the speed of something or to i ncrease how fast you are doing something – in this case, how fast she is spe aking. Jerome says, “She’s making a lengthy speech even longer.” “Lengthy” (le ngthy) means lasting a long time, taking a long time. “At this rate,” Jerome sa ys, “we’ll be here until midnight.” “At this rate” (rate) means if we continue going at  this speed. Jerome is saying that if the woman keeps speaking so slowly, they wi ll be there listening to her until midnight – presumably many hours in the futur e.

Elise says, “Maybe we should try to pay attention a nd take notes like we’re supposed to.” She’s suggesting to Jerome that they actually listen to the speaker and maybe write some things down about what she is saying. Jerome says, “How can we,” meaning how can we do that, “when her  voice is so hypnotic?” “Hypnotic” (hypnotic) is someone who either makes y ou feel tired and sleepy because the way they are speaking is slow and unint eresting, or just the opposite – someone is so interesting that you feel as though  you are under their control.

The word “hypnotic” comes from “hypnosis,” which is  the process supposedly of making someone go into a certain mental state in wh ich the person can perhaps be given certain suggestions that will affect his o r her actions or behavior in the future. In movies and on television, you often see someone being hypnotized by taking an object such as a little watch and making the watch go back and forth in front of the person’s eyes until they somehow fall asleep or fall into this different mental state.

 That’s where the word “hypnotic” comes from. Again it’s an unusual word. Here, it’s being used to mean someone is so boring that y ou’re falling asleep, but it can also be used as an adjective to describe someone wh o is very interesting. So interesting that you are almost in a hypnotic state  and that person could control you because the person is so interesting, and perha ps so persuasive. Jerome thinks the second speaker is hypnotic.

Elise says, “I know what you mean. I think I need s ome coffee. Do you want some?” In the meantime, Jerome has actually fallen asleep. He makes a noise because he begins “to snore” (snore). “To snore” is  to make a noise with your mouth and/or nose while you are sleeping. That is a n example of “snoring.” Jerome has fallen asleep because he starts to snore .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: Did you hear what the speaker said?

Elise: No, I didn’t catch that either. She’s racing  through her presentation like she’s late for her train.

Jerome: I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of s peech that it’s dizzying. I wish she’d slow down so I could make out what she’s sayi ng. Most of it is mumbled or garbled.

Elise: She’s got to be breaking a record for the nu mber of words per minute. Hey wait, she’s done. The next speaker has to be better .

Jerome: Oh my God, she’s worse! She must be the slo west speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sentence seems int erminable. She just keeps droning on and on and on.

Elise: At least we can understand her.

Jerome: Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pace. She ’s making a lengthy speech even longer. At this rate, we’ll be here until midn ight!

Elise: Maybe we should try to pay attention and tak e notes like we’re supposed to.

 Jerome: How can we when her voice is so hypnotic?

Elise: I know what you mean. I think I need some co ffee. Do you want some?

Jerome: [snores]

Elise: Jerome, Jerome!

# Repairing Damage to an Auto Body

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,257 – Repairing Damage to an Auto Body.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  1,257. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store which has additional courses in business English, cultural En glish, and everyday English.

This episode is a dialogue between Miles and Yuki a bout getting your car fixed when someone has hit it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Miles: It’s something, isn’t it?

Yuki: Yeah, it’s something all right. Where did you  get this heap?

Miles: My uncle sold it to me. This car has been si tting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a good pric e. I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little damage and I want to make it look good again.

Yuki: A little damage?! The bumpers are falling off  and the frame is bent. Was this car in an accident? I’m worried about its stru ctural integrity.

Miles: It was in a small accident, but none of thes e cosmetic things affects how it runs.

Yuki: I mean there are dents and dings everywhere, and paint scratches so deep you might need to get a whole new paint job.

Miles: I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.

Yuki: Wait a second. There’s rust all over the unde rcarriage.

Miles: When do you think you can have it ready for me to pick up?

Yuki: It’s ready now.

Miles: Now?

Yuki: Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up and  take to a salvage yard!

[end of dialogue]

Miles begins with saying, “It’s something, isn’t it ?” The meaning of this expression depends on how it is said and the contex t or situation in which it is said. It could mean it’s something really good. It’ s something fantastic. It could also mean that it isn’t very good. I think Miles sa ys it in a way that suggests that it is something good. He’s talking about a car that hi s uncle sold to him. Yuki, however, doesn’t agree. She says, “Yeah, it’s somet hing all right.” The addition of that expression “all right” is used here to indicat e that perhaps what the other person said isn’t correct or perhaps isn’t complete .

Yuki says, “Where did you get this heap (heap)?” “H eap” is usually a large number of objects that are on top of each other, th at aren’t organized in any way. You could have a “heap of papers” – a bunch of or c ollection of papers on your desk that aren’t organized in any way. It looks rat her messy. In this case, however, she’s referring to the car as being a coll ection of pieces that aren’t organized very well. It’s just another way of sayin g “this piece of junk” (junk), which is something you would normally throw away. I f we use the word “heap” to describe a car, we mean it’s not a very good car.

Miles says, “My uncle sold it to me.” This car has been sitting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a goo d price.” Miles says, “I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little da mage and I want to make it look good again.” “Auto body” refers to the outside  of the car, or more specifically, work done to repair the way a car loo ks. So, if you say you need “auto body work,” you mean you need the outside of your car fixed. We’re not talking about the motor or the engine part of the c ar.

Yuki says, “A little damage?!” She is surprise that  Miles is describing his car as having a “little,” or not very much, damage. She sa ys, “The bumpers are falling off and the frame is bent.” The “bumpers” (bumpers)  of a car are the parts that are in the front and the back that are supposed to protect the car if you get into an accident, if you hit some thing or some other ca r. “The bumpers are falling off,” she says, meaning they are about to come off of the car because they’re not attached properly or because they’re so old.

“The frame is bent” (bent), Yuki says. Something th at is “bent” is something that is not straight the way it should be. The “frame” of a car is the basic structure of

the car. If you can think of the car without any of  the doors or engine or other parts that make the car run, that would be the “fra me” of the car, sort of like your skeleton in your body consists of the bones in your  body, and then you have everything around and on top of your bones. Well, t he frame of the car is like the skeleton of the car.

“Was this car in an accident?” Yuki asks. “I’m worr ied about its structural integrity.” The “structure” (structure) of somethin g is similar to the frame or skeleton of an object. It gives it its basic shape.  “Structural integrity” (integrity) refers to how strong that structure is, how well th at structure will survive, say, other damage. The “structural integrity” of a bridg e refers to how strong the bridge is – whether the bridge is going to stay up or not. Yuki is talking about the structural integrity of the car.

Miles says, “It was in a small accident, but none of these cosmetic things affects how it runs.” “Cosmetic” (cosmetic) is an adjective  that describes the way something looks. In this case, we might think of it  as the outside part of the car – not how it functions, not how it works. Miles uses the verb “run” (run) to describe how the car functions. He says, “None of these cosm etic things,” or cosmetic damage, “affects” or has any influence on how the c ar operates, “how it runs.”

Yuki says, “I mean there are dents and dings everyw here, and paint scratches so deep you might need a whole new paint job.” A “dent ” (dent) is created when you take something that is flat and you hit it, say wit h a hammer or another hard object. If you do that to a piece of metal, it will  create a dent in the metal. It’s not a hole – it doesn’t go through the metal – but it b ends the metal, causing a dent in the metal.

A “ding” (ding) is a very small dent in a car. If y ou park your car next to another car and the person in the car next to you opens his  door and it hits the side of your door in a very strong or forceful way, it migh t cause a “ding” in the side of your door, a small dent. Yuki also mentions “paint scratches” (scratches). A “scratch” is a small line in a painted object. So, if you have red paint on the side of your car and there’s a scratch in it, you may se e white – that would be the metal underneath the paint.

The scratches are so deep, Yuki says, that Miles “m ight need a whole new paint job.” A “paint job” is when you have to repaint, or  put new paint on the entire car. A “deep scratch” is one that goes far into the meta l so that it can’t be easily fixed by just putting a little paint on top of that area.  Miles says, “I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.” Appar ently Miles is asking Yuki to

do the auto body work. “To work your magic” means t o use your skills in such a way as to make something better again or perfect ag ain.

Yuki says, “Wait a second. There’s rust all over the undercarriage.” “Rust” (rust) is another word for what we could also refer to as “oxidation,” in a technical sense. It’s a reddish-orange powder that appears on  metal when it has been damaged by having water on it. Rust is not a good t hing for the metal, of course, because it can make the metal weaker. It can actual ly cause the metal to disintegrate or to break up into small pieces. The “undercarriage” (undercarriage) of a car is the bottom of the car, usually includin g the bottom of the frame and the wheels.

Miles says, “When do you think you can have it read y for me to pick up?” So we learn now that Yuki works at the auto body shop, the place where he is bringing the car to be fixed. He wants to know when Yuki can  finish fixing it. Yuki says, “It’s ready now.” Miles says, “Now?” He’s confused because he just, of course, brought the car to Yuki. Yuki is making something of a joke. She says, “Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up,” meaning to take a way, “and to take to a salvage yard.”

A “salvage (salvage) yard (yard)” is a place where there are a lot of old cars and other machines that no longer work and that are use d only for their “parts” (parts), meaning people take the cars apart, or the  other machines, and they reuse the different parts from those cars or machin es for other things, or for other cars and machines. What Yuki is saying is that it i s not possible to fix this old car, that it would be better for Miles simply to take it  and perhaps sell it to the salvage yard since no one would want to drive the car anymo re as it is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Miles: It’s something, isn’t it?

Yuki: Yeah, it’s something all right. Where did you  get this heap?

Miles: My uncle sold it to me. This car has been si tting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a good pric e. I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little damage and I want to make it look good again.

Yuki: A little damage?! The bumpers are falling off  and the frame is bent. Was this car in an accident? I’m worried about its stru ctural integrity.

Yuki: I mean there are dents and dings everywhere, and paint scratches so deep you might need to get a whole new paint job.

Miles: I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.

Miles: When do you think you can have it ready for me to pick up?

Yuki: It’s ready now.

Miles: Now?

Yuki: Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up and  take to a salvage yard!

# Causes of Plane Crashes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,258 – Causes of Plane Crashes.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,258. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website now (well, please) at ESLPod.com.  Become a member of ESL Podcast and get access to all of our wonderful Learning Guides.

This episode is a dialogue between Angelica and Cor ey about what is always bad news, a plane crash – when a plane falls down o ut of the sky. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angelica: So the book I’m writing starts with a pla ne crash.

Corey: What caused it?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter. That’s not part of the  story.

Corey: But characters have backstories, so you shou ld have a backstory for the plane crash.

Angelica: Okay, the plane crashed because of mechan ical failure, or better yet, pilot error.

Corey: What happened? Was it because the pilot misr ead the instruments or had a problem navigating?

Angelica: I don’t know.

Corey: Maybe he or she was incapacitated due to an illness. What kind of illness?

Angelica: Forget it. Let’s say instead that it happ ened because of an act of God.

Corey: Like a lightning strike? That’s not very lik ely.

Angelica: Okay, how about some problem with the fli ght crew that caused the cabin to depressurize and the plane to go into a ta ilspin.

Corey: What was the problem with the fight crew?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter!

Corey: Maybe a member of the flight crew was a hija cker and it was an act of terrorism.

Angelica: Okay, let’s say that’s what happened. Hap py?

Corey: But wait! Who was the terrorist? What were h is aims and what was his cause?

Angelica: You know what? I think you should put tha t in your book!

[end of dialogue]

Angelica says to Corey, “So the book I’m writing st arts with a plane crash.” Notice Angelica begins the sentence with the word “ so.” “So” has become in English, in many cases nowadays, the same as “um” o r “well” or other, what we call, “filler words” – words people use to begin a sentence that don’t really have any specific meaning. Angelica could have just said , “The book I’m writing starts with a plane crash.” “Plane” (plane) refers to a ma chine that flies in the air. A “plane” usually has two, what we call, “wings” (win gs) which are like arms that extend or go out from the side of the plane.

Now, what you don’t want to happen if you are in a plane is a “crash” (crash). A “crash” is when a plane falls out of the sky or hit s something, and usually bad things follow – bad things happen when that happens  to a plane, when it crashes. The verb “to crash” (crash) is used when a ny kind of vehicle like a plane or a car hits something that it’s not supposed to. In this case, a “plane crash” refers to when a plane usually hits the ground at a  very fast speed and explodes or is damaged in some way. Angelica is writing a bo ok about a plane crash.

Corey asks, “What caused it?” meaning “Why did the plane crash?” The “cause” (cause) of something is the reason something happen ed. Angelica says, “It doesn’t matter,” meaning it’s not important. “That’ s not part of the story,” she says. Corey says, however, that the “characters hav e back stories, so you should have a backstory for the plane crash.” The word “ba ckstory” (backstory) refers to

the information about a character or someone in a b ook, play, movie, or TV show before they appear in the story.

So it’s, if you will, the history of that character , of that person in the story, before the story begins. Now why is backstory important? W ell, because in order to understand a story, every character, every person i n the story, needs to have some sort of history, some sort of reason why they do what they do or why they are in the story, and so the backstory is the story  of the characters, of the people in a story, before the story begins. I hope that ma kes sense.

“Backstory” is one of those words that gets used a lot here in Los Angeles, where of course many of the movies and television shows a re written – often at some of the cafés I go to. Every time I go to a café here i n Los Angeles, there’s usually someone working on a “script” (script). A script is  the dialogue, or what the people say, in a movie or a TV show.

Corey is saying that the plane crash needs to have a backstory. There needs to be a reason for it that is somehow part of the stor y or the book that Angelica is writing. Angelica says, “Okay, the plane crashed be cause of mechanical failure, or better yet, pilot error.” “Mechanical” (mechanic al) refers to something in a machine or something related to a machine. “Failure ” (failure) is when something goes wrong, when there’s a problem with something. “Mechanical failure” would be when something goes wrong with some part of the plane.

Angelica says, “The plane crashed because of mechan ical failure.” But then she comes up with another reason: “Or better yet,” she says, “pilot error.” The phrase “better yet” (yet) is used when you have a better i dea than the one you just mentioned. In this case, Angelica first says the pl ane crashed because of mechanical failure, and then she thinks of a better  reason. So she says, “better yet, pilot (pilot) error (error).”

The “pilot” is the person who is in charge of or wh o is guiding the plane, usually in the front of the plane. There are often two peop le in front of the plane, the “pilot” and what we call the “copilot” (copilot). T he copilot is the person who helps the pilot fly the plane, or who flies the plane if the pilot is not able to. “Error” (error) is when something goes wrong, or in this ca se when a person makes a mistake – when a person “errs” (errs). So, “pilot e rror” would be when a pilot makes a mistake, which of course we don’t want to h appen.

Corey says, “What happened? Was it because the pilo t misread the instruments or had a problem navigating?” Corey is trying to fi nd out more about why Angelica’s pilot made a mistake in her book. One re ason could be that the pilot

“misread” (misread). “To misread” (the past tense i s spelled the same but pronounced differently – “misread”) means to read o r look at something but not do it carefully, do it in such a way that you make a mistake.

“Instruments” refer to things on the airplane, in t his case, that indicate or show how the plane is doing – how high the plane is flyi ng, what direction the plane is flying in, and so forth. So, if a pilot “misreads” the instruments on the plane, the pilot is not looking carefully enough and getting t he wrong information, if you will, from the instruments, or not the correct informatio n. Corey also suggests that perhaps the pilot had a problem “navigating.” “To n avigate” (navigate) means to determine which direction you are going in a car, b oat, or a plane.

Angelica doesn’t have an answer to Corey. She says,  “I don’t know.” She doesn’t know, of course, because she’s just inventing these  things as she’s talking. She’s just making them up, which of course is what all au thors, all writers do, but Angelica hasn’t thought about it very carefully. Co rey then says, “Maybe he or she,” referring to the pilot, “was incapacitated du e to illness.” “To be incapacitated” (incapacitated) means to be unable t o use your body or perhaps your brain because you are either sick or injured.

If you are “incapacitated due to an accident,” beca use of an accident, you may be unable to walk, for example. You may have broken  your legs. That would be a case of being “incapacitated” – unable to do what y ou normally do. “Capacitated” comes from the word “capability,” which is “able to  do something.” So, “incapacitated” is “not able to do something.”

Angelica isn’t interested in this discussion. She s ays, “Let’s say instead,” in place of the reason she’s already given, “that it happene d” – that is, the plane crashed – “because of an act of God.” The phrase “act of Go d” usually refers to an event that people have no control over, that wasn’t cause d by anything human beings can do or have done, such as a flood or an earthqua ke or a hurricane. These are also sometimes called “natural disasters” – things that happen that are not caused by human beings.

Corey says, “Like a lightning strike?” He’s giving an example of an “act of God,” and one of those examples is a “lightning (lightnin g) strike (strike).” “Lightning” refers to an exchange of electricity either within clouds above in the sky, or between the earth and a cloud. Usually there’s a lo ud sound which we call “thunder” (thunder) that you hear after lightning. “Lightning” is usually indicated by a bright flash of light. Corey says a lightning strike is not a very likely or probable thing that would cause a plane crash.

Angelica then changes her mind again. She says, “Ok ay, how about some problem with the flight crew that caused the cabin to depressurize and the plane to go into a tailspin.” The “flight crew” (crew) re fers to the people who work on the airplane – not just the pilots but also the people in the back part of the plane who are giving you drinks and making sure everyone stay s in his or her seat. The “cabin” (cabin) refers to the main part of the plan e where everyone sits. The cabin is where most people in the plane sit. The very front of the plane where the pilots are is  usually called the “cockpit” (cockpit).

So, you have the “cabin,” which is where everyone s its other than the pilots, who are in the “cockpit” in the front of the plane. If the cabin “depressurizes,” it loses the pressure that is normally inside of a plane tha t allows you to be able to breathe in the plane. When a plane goes up very hig h in the sky, it has to be pressurized in order to allow people inside of the cabin to breathe normally, but if it “depressurizes,” that can cause the plane to cra sh.

One way a plane can crash is to go into a “tailspin ” (tailspin). A tailspin is when a plane falls from the sky down to the ground, often by spinning around in a circle. Angelica suggests that the plane crashed because the flight crew did something to cause the cabin to depressurize and the plane we nt into a tailspin. Corey says, “What was the problem with the flight crew?” Angeli ca is getting impatient. She says, “It doesn’t matter!” meaning it’s not importa nt. She said that already, of course, earlier in the dialogue.

Corey then comes up with another possible reason for the plane to crash. He says, “Maybe a member of the flight crew was a hija cker and it was an act of terrorism.” A “hijacker” (hijacker) is a person who  uses violence or some other threat to take control, usually of an airplane, in order to do something bad – sometimes to get money, other times to escape from the authorities (people who may want to arrest that person), or sometimes to ca use damage with the plane itself. An “act of terrorism” refers to any violenc e that is done in order to make people afraid or to try to achieve some sort of pol itical or military goal. We are all sadly aware of acts of terrorism nowadays.

Angelica says, “Okay, let’s say that’s what happene d. Happy?” meaning “Are you happy now that I have taken your reason as the back story for the plane crash?” Corey apparently is not happy. He says, “But wait! Who is the terrorist? What were his aims” – that is, what was he trying to acc omplish, what was he trying to do – “and what was his cause?” meaning what was his  political motivation for doing what he was doing.

 Angelica says, “You know what? I think you should p ut that in your book!” Angelica is telling Corey that he should write his own book and he can put all of that information, all of these reasons, into his ow n book, and he should stop trying to make Angelica think of reasons for the pl ane crash for her book.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angelica: So the book I’m writing starts with a pla ne crash.

Corey: What caused it?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter. That’s not part of the  story.

Corey: But characters have backstories, so you shou ld have a backstory for the plane crash.

Angelica: Okay, the plane crashed because of mechan ical failure, or better yet, pilot error.

Corey: What happened? Was it because the pilot misr ead the instruments or had a problem navigating?

Angelica: I don’t know.

Corey: Maybe he or she was incapacitated due to an illness. What kind of illness?

 Angelica: Okay, let’s say that’s what happened. Hap py?

Kelly: [sniffling]

Yoon: What’s the matter? Are you okay?

Kelly: You know that my mother’s funeral was last w eekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and I’ve ha d a shock.

Yoon: What? An old family secret? Some skeleton in the closet?

Kelly: It was for my mother. While reading some of her letters, I found out that she had a son out of wedlock when she was young and  she gave the baby up for adoption.

Yoon: Wow, that’s a bombshell!

Kelly: Yeah, I feel like I’ve been sucker punched. This is life-changing.

Yoon: Maybe you can ask your aunts and uncles about  it.

Kelly: But what if my mother didn’t disclose this t o me for a reason? I don’t want to air her dirty laundry now that she’s gone.

 Yoon: You wouldn’t be airing dirty laundry. A part of your family history has come to light and you have questions. That’s natural. An d plus, you’re keeping it in the family.

Kelly: But maybe they’ll feel like I’m dredging up something they wish had been forgotten.

Yoon: Or maybe they’ve been waiting for a chance to  talk about it. You haven’t mentioned the most shocking part.

Kelly: What’s that?

Yoon: You may have a half-brother somewhere out the re.

Kelly: Oh my God, you’re right. That possibility is  both thrilling and terrifying!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kelly “sniffling” (sniffli ng). “To sniffle,” as you heard, is to make a loud sound, usually because you are eithe r crying or perhaps you are sick. You sniffle with your nose when you breathe i n air, when the inside of your nose is wet. Yoon asks Kelly, realizing that she is  crying, “What’s the matter?” meaning “What is the problem?” What’s wrong? He say s, “Are you okay?”

Kelly says, “You know that my mother’s funeral was last weekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and  I’ve had a shock.” A “funeral” (funeral) is a ceremony, often a religiou s ceremony, that you have when someone dies. Kelly’s mother died last weekend, and  she brought some of her mother’s papers, some of her documents, home with h er “to sort through,” meaning to look at and determine which ones she wan ts to keep and perhaps which she wants to get rid of.

She had a “shock,” however, when she read through h er mother’s papers. A “shock” (shock) is a big surprise. It could be a go od thing. It could be a bad thing. Here, because Kelly was crying, we know that it was  a bad thing. Yoon says, “What? An old family secret?” A “family secret” is something about your family that you don’t want other people to find out about or perhaps some members of your family don’t want you to find out about. Yoon then says, “Some skeleton in the closet?”

This expression “a skeleton in the closet” refers t o a family secret that is embarrassing or perhaps one that is shameful, that you don’t want other people to find out about. Literally, the word “skeleton” ( skeleton) refers to the bones of a human body, usually the bones of someone who is dea d and whose body has, I guess we would say, “decomposed,” or has decayed to  such an extent that all you see are the bones. You don’t see any of the ski n or other parts of the body. A “closet” (closet) is where you keep things. It’s wh ere you, we would say, “store” (store) things such as clothing.

Most houses and apartments have closets where peopl e put their clothing, but imagine if you killed someone and then put his body  in the back of your closet to hide it so no one would find out. Eventually, many years later, someone could look in your closet and they would see a skeleton –  the bones of the person whom you had killed. Well, that would be a very big  family secret, and that’s perhaps where we get this expression from, of “a sk eleton in the closet.” It doesn’t refer to someone you actually kill, however , but anything embarrassing that you don’t want other people to find out about.

Kelly said, “It was for my mother,” meaning the fam ily secret or the shock, I guess, was for her mother. “While reading some of h er letters,” Kelly says, “I found out that she had a son out of wedlock when sh e was young and she gave the baby up for adoption.” The expression “out of w edlock” (wedlock) means that you had a child when you weren’t married or before you got married. “Out of wedlock” means “outside of marriage.” “Wedlock” is an old term for being married. We don’t use it very often anymore.

In fact, this expression is not used very often any more to refer to children who are born to parents who are not married, probably b ecause there are now a high percentage of children, at least in the U.S., who a re born to parents who are not married. So, it is no longer something that people keep secret. It is no longer something that people find embarrassing, and so we no longer use this expression as much as one did, say, when I was grow ing up or earlier.

In any case, her mother “had a son out of wedlock w hen she was young and she gave the baby up for adoption” (adoption). “Adoptio n” is the process of bringing a child into your family as a son or daughter even th ough the child is not biologically related to you – that is, you did not have the child, or you did not participate in the making of the child. Let’s put it that way. We usually talk about someone, a young woman in this case, “giving up the  baby” or “giving the baby up for adoption,” meaning the mother decides not to  keep the child but to have another family raise the child as its own.

Yoon then says, “Wow, that’s a bombshell” (bombshel l). A “bombshell” is some very surprising and shocking news, often a negative  piece of news. The word “bombshell” can also be used to describe a very att ractive looking woman. When I was growing up, people would sometimes use the ph rase about a beautiful actress or model, “a blonde bombshell.” “Blonde” me aning, of course, a light- yellow-colored hair. I don’t think we use the word “bombshell” in that sense as much anymore. Here it has nothing to do with a beau tiful woman; it has to do with a shocking, surprising piece of news.

Kelly says, “Yeah, I feel like I’ve been sucker pun ched. This is life-changing.” “To be punched” (punched) means to be hit with the fist  or a closed hand of another person. The expression “sucker (sucker) punched” re fers to someone hitting you unexpectedly and very hard. Here it refers to a ver y shocking piece of news given to you by someone perhaps as a way of hurting  you, or simply as a very surprising piece of news that has affected you in a  negative way. She says, “This is life-changing,” meaning, of course, it changes h er whole life, or at least she thinks it will.

Yoon says, “Maybe you can ask your aunts and uncles  about it.” Your “aunts” are the sisters of your parents. Your “uncles” are the brothers of your parents. Kelly says, “But what if my mother didn’t disclose this t o me for a reason?” “To disclose” (disclose) means to tell someone somethin g that is secret or hidden or confidential, something no one else knows, or at le ast something you don’t know that the person is keeping a secret.

Kelly says, “I don’t want to air her dirty laundry now that she’s gone.” The expression “to air (air) your dirty laundry (laundr y)” means to talk about private or secret information with other people who don’t real ly need to know about it, who perhaps don’t even want to know about it. “Dirty la undry” implies that it’s embarrassing information or information that you wo uld not want other people to hear about.

We use the word “laundry” to talk about clothing th at is dirty or things that need to be washed – or, somewhat oddly, things that have ju st been washed and are clean and have not yet been worn. The verb “to air”  here probably refers literally to put your clothing outside so that it gets dry in  the air, although you might also use the verb “to air” to mean to put out some piece  of clothing or other material that has a smell that you want to get rid of. You m ay put it outside “to air out,” we might say, using the phrasal verb “air out” (out).

Yoon agrees with Kelly that she should not be airin g dirty laundry. “A part of your family history has come to light,” he says, “and yo u have questions.” “Come to

light” means that something that previously had bee n secret now becomes known to people. People find out about some secret information. We could refer to that information as “coming to light.” It was in  the dark before. It was secret before. Yoon says it’s natural, meaning it’s normal , that Kelly doesn’t want to air her mother’s dirty laundry and that she wants to “k eep it in the family,” meaning not let anyone else find out about it outside of he r family.

Kelly then says, “But maybe they’ll feel like I’m d redging up something they wish had been forgotten.” She’s now giving a reason why she should perhaps talk to her aunts and uncles after all. “To dredge (dredge)  up” something means to talk about something that is secret from your past or fr om a long time ago. “To dredge up” can also simply mean to talk about somet hing bad that happened a long time ago that you have forgotten about or that  you don’t want to talk about anymore.

Kelly is worried that she would be “dredging up old  information” with her aunts and uncles that her aunts and uncles don’t want to talk about anymore. Yoon says, “Or maybe they’ve,” meaning her uncles, “have  been waiting for a chance” – or opportunity – “to talk about it.” “You haven’t  mentioned the most shocking part” – that is, Yoon is saying here that Kelly has n’t even talked about an even more surprising piece of news. Kelly says, “What’s that?”

Yoon says, “You may have a half-brother somewhere o ut there.” A “half-brother” is someone that you are related to because you have  the same father or the same mother. So, for example, if a woman gets marri ed and has a son, and her husband dies and she gets married again and has ano ther son, her two sons would be “half-brothers.” They have the same mother  but different fathers.

Kelly says, “Oh my God, you’re right. That possibil ity” – that is, the possibility that her brother is still alive – “is both thrilling and  terrifying!” Something that is “thrilling” (thrilling) is something that is very e xciting in a positive way. Something that is “terrifying” (terrifying) is something that  is scary, something that frightens you, something that causes you to feel fear. Kelly is not sure if she is “thrilled” by meeting a half-brother or “terrified” by the fact t hat she has one. I’m not sure why she’d be terrified, but she apparently is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kelly: [sniffling]

 Yoon: What’s the matter? Are you okay?

Kelly: You know that my mother’s funeral was last w eekend. I brought some of her papers home with me to sort through and I’ve ha d a shock.

Yoon: What? An old family secret? Some skeleton in the closet?

# Transport and Shipping Mishaps

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,260 – Transport and Shipping Mishaps.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,260. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. How are you toda y? Me, pretty good. Thanks for asking.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can get it by going to our website at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Una and Jackson about problems that can happen when you are moving things from one place to  another. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Una: Get on the horn and find out where our cargo i s.

Jackson: I’ve been trying. Last week, I finally rea ched someone at the transport company and all they would tell me was that due to unforeseen circumstances, there will be a delay in delivery.

Una: Didn’t they give you any details?

Jackson: None at all. When I called again two days later, I spoke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in trans it, such as a truck breakdown or accident.

Una: But our cargo is being shipped by sea.

Jackson: That’s what I told her. She said the delay  could be due to something as simple as bad weather and that our cargo probably h asn’t been captured for ransom or lost at sea.

Una: Captured for ransom?! Lost at sea?!

Jackson: She said that probably hasn’t happened. Wh en I called again yesterday, I was told the cargo had arrived at the port, but that there’s a problem.

Una: What kind of problem?

 Jackson: The person I spoke to didn’t know, but tho ught that it could be a delay in customs clearance or even a loss of refrigeratio n.

Una: A loss of refrigeration?! That would be disast rous.

Jackson: I know, but then again, who thought transp orting Alaska snow to California was a good idea?

Una: Our wonderful director, remember?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Una saying to Jackson, “Ge t on the horn and find out where our cargo is.” The expression “get on the hor n” (horn) is a somewhat old expression, but you will still hear people using it . That means to make a phone call or to call someone by telephone. Una tells Jac kson to “get on the horn and find out,” or determine, where their “cargo” (cargo ) is. “Cargo” refers to things that are moved or transported by truck, train, or ship, that are usually large and heavy.

We think about “cargo” as being large boxes or larg e containers that have things in them. On an airplane, for example, the cargo usu ally goes on the bottom of the plane. Your “luggage” – that is, your suitcases – a re cargo, at least they are when they are put together with a bunch of other su itcases and placed on the bottom of the plane. You can move cargo by train or  ship or truck. Cargo is usually, but not always, things that are being sold  that are being moved from one company to another.

Jackson says, “I’ve been trying” – that is, I’ve be en trying to find out where our cargo is. “Last week,” he says, “I finally reached someone,” meaning I finally was able to talk to someone, “at the transport company. ” A “transport (transport) company” is a business that moves things from one p lace to another. The verb “to transport” means to move something. So, a “tran sport company” would be a company that moves things, usually for other compan ies, in a truck, a plane, or perhaps a ship or train.

Jackson says the transport company said “that due t o unforeseen circumstances,” there was going to be a delay in de livery. “Unforeseen” (unforeseen) is something that you don’t anticipate , that you don’t predict. Something that is unexpected is “unforeseen.” “Unfo reseen circumstances”

would be a situation usually when something goes wr ong that you didn’t expect. And of course, we never expect anything to go wrong , do we?

“There will be a delay in delivery,” Jackson says, because of these unforeseen circumstances, these unforeseen situations. A “dela y” (delay) is a period of time longer than expected. When you go to the airport an d your plane doesn’t leave at the time it’s supposed to, we would say the plane h as been “delayed,” using it as a verb, or simply that there has been “a delay,” us ing it as a noun. A “delay” is when things are taking longer than expected or are not happening at the time they should.

“Delivery” is moving something from one place to an other, usually from the company that sells the product to the company or pe rson that is buying the product. You can get “food delivery.” You can get a  restaurant to bring food to your house, or some other company will pick up your  food at the restaurant and bring it to your house. If you call a restaurant to  order some food, they may ask you, “Is that for pickup or delivery?” “Pickup” mea ns you will go and pick up, or get, the food. “Delivery” means they will bring the  food to you.

Una says, “Didn’t they give you any details?” She’s  asking Jackson if the company explained why there was a delay. Jackson sa ys, “None at all,” meaning no, they didn’t give me any specific information. T hey didn’t give me any details. He says, “When I called again two days later, I spo ke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in transit, such as a truck breakdown or accident.” A “mishap” (mishap) is when something bad happens that creates a problem.

Another word for a “mishap” would be simply an “acc ident” – something bad that happens that you, of course, didn’t expect. “In tra nsit” (transit) means while you are transporting or moving something. A “mishap in transit” means something bad happened during the process of moving things fr om one place to another. One possible thing that might have caused this dela y is a “truck breakdown” (breakdown). A “breakdown” is when a machine stops working – in this case, a truck.

Una says, “But our cargo is being shipped by sea.” “To ship” (ship) something is usually to send something either using the official  government mail service or a private delivery system or service, such as UPS or Federal Express or DHL. Una says that their cargo “is being shipped,” or transp orted, “by sea,” meaning in a boat or ship. So, a truck accident couldn’t be the reason why there is a delay.

Jackson says, “That’s what I told her,” meaning tha t’s also the same thing I told the woman I spoke with. “She said the delay could b e due to something as simple as bad weather and that our cargo probably h asn’t been captured for ransom or lost at sea.” The woman Jackson spoke wit h said the delay “could be due to something as simple as bad weather,” meaning  maybe the reason there is a delay is there was bad weather that prevented or slowed down the transport.

Then the woman at the transport company told Jackso n that the cargo “probably,” meaning most likely, “has not been capt ured for ransom or lost at sea.” Well, of course, these are two very bad thing s that you would not expect to happen. One thing is that your cargo would be “capt ured for ransom.” “To capture” (capture) something is to take something, to steal something. “Ransom” (ransom) is when you ask someone for money to get s omething or someone returned to that person.

Usually we think about ransom with what is called a  “kidnapping” – when someone is taken against his will and held until so meone pays you money. Here, Jackson is talking about the possibility of their c argo being “captured for ransom,” or even worse, “lost at sea.” If something is “lost  at sea,” basically a boat or ship has sunk, has gone down into the water, and so has your cargo. So you’ll never get it back. Una is shocked. She’s surprised that J ackson is talking about these terrible things that might have happened, such as “ captured for ransom” and “lost at sea.”

Jackson says, “She said that probably hasn’t happen ed. When I called again yesterday, I was told the cargo had arrived at the port, but that there’s a problem.” A “port” (port) is a place where many shi ps, large ships, come and bring cargo which is then delivered to trucks or ot her means of transportation. Here in Los Angeles, we have the Port of Los Angele s, where ships from all over the Pacific, largely from Asia, come and bring thin gs to the United States – cargo which is then put on either trucks or trains and th en delivered to different parts of the U.S.

Jackson says that their cargo has arrived at the po rt – so it was not lost at sea – but still there is a problem. Una says, “What kind of problem?” Jackson says, “The person I spoke to didn’t know, but thought tha t it could be a delay in customs clearance or even a loss of refrigeration.”  “Customs” (customs) here refers to the process of the government approving e ntry of certain things into a country. When you go to another country, you usuall y have to go through customs. They make sure you’re not bringing anythin g into the country you’re not supposed to or that you’re not paying for properly.

“Clearance” (clearance) is the process of the gover nment officials approving your cargo, in this case – saying yes, it’s okay, there’ s no problem, you can bring this into the country. Jackson says that maybe the delay  in getting their cargo was due to “customs clearance issues” or, he says, “a l oss of refrigeration.” “Refrigeration” (refrigeration) is the process of k eeping something cold. So, if your cargo is food and you are sending it in a ship  over many, many miles, you will want it to keep cold so that the food doesn’t go bad.

A “loss of refrigeration” would mean that for some reason the ship was unable to keep the food cold. That’s why Una says, “A loss of  refrigeration?! That would be disastrous” (disastrous). “Disastrous” comes from t he word “disaster,” which is a terrible event, a terrible thing that happens. An e arthquake that kills many people is a “disaster.” Una says that a loss of refrigerat ion would be “disastrous” for her and her company.

Jackson says, “I know” – meaning yes, I understand that that would be disastrous – “but,” he says, “then again, who thoug ht transporting Alaska snow to California was a good idea?” The phrase “then again ” is used when we are going to present a new idea after thinking about it some more. Usually we use this when we’re going to present a different idea from t he one we just talked about, or perhaps to provide a different perspective on thing s compared to what we just said.

I could say, for example, “I want to go to the movi es, but then again, there aren’t any good movies I really want to see.” “But then ag ain” introduces a different idea that contrasts or is somehow providing a different perspective than the first idea. Jackson says, “Who thought transporting Alaska snow  to California was a good idea?” Now we find out what the cargo that is being  sent to their company is. It’s snow from Alaska.

Jackson, of course, doesn’t think this was a good i dea. Una says, “Our wonderful director, remember?” We learn that this company doe sn’t belong to Una because she’s not the boss. The person who is the boss is t he “director” (director). A “director” is a person who leads an organization or  part of an organization. Una says, “Our wonderful director,” but she of course i s making a joke. She doesn’t think the director is wonderful because he or she h ad this very dumb idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Una: Get on the horn and find out where our cargo i s.

 Jackson: I’ve been trying. Last week, I finally rea ched someone at the transport company and all they would tell me was that due to unforeseen circumstances, there will be a delay in delivery.

Una: Didn’t they give you any details?

Jackson: None at all. When I called again two days later, I spoke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in trans it, such as a truck breakdown or accident.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,261 – Reading about Research on Health.

This dialogue is between Vivian and Eric about read ing the research, the scientific studies, about our health. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Vivian: Wait! Don’t use that toaster.

Eric: Why? I want some toast for breakfast.

Vivian: It isn’t safe. I’ve just read about a resea rch study that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.

Eric: That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with  my coffee.

Vivian: You can’t use the coffee maker, either. The  use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.

Eric: Are you putting me on? Where are you getting this junk science?

Vivian: From very reputable sources.

Eric: I bet these so-called researchers are making sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexistent d ata.

Vivian: Stop!

Eric: What now? I’m opening the refrigerator to get  some milk.

Vivian: Refrigerators emit harmful rays that can be  bad for your vision.

Eric: Wait a second. Are you having trouble sleepin g again?

Vivian: As a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.

Eric: I don’t need any research study to tell me th at people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts!

[end of dialogue]

Vivian begins by saying to Eric, “Wait!” which here  means “stop.” “Don’t use that toaster.” A “toaster” (toaster) is a small machine in the kitchen that heats up bread so that it’s hard on the outside. You, of cou rse, make toast with a toaster. Eric says, “Why? I want some toast for breakfast.” Americans often eat toast with breakfast. Sometimes they’ll make toast and use it for a sandwich, but it’s most commonly eaten in the morning with butter or someth ing sweet on top of it. I like toast with my eggs in the morning.

Vivian says, “The toaster isn’t safe,” meaning it c ould harm you. It could hurt you. She continues, “I’ve just read about a research stu dy that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.” A “rese arch (research) study” is a scientific paper or publication usually appearing i n what we would call a “scientific journal,” which is basically a magazine. A “researc h study” is a report on the results of some scientific investigation, some scie ntific study of a certain phenomenon.

In this case, we’re talking about a research study related to “health” – how your body works, how your body functions. The word “rese arch” can also be used in singular form to refer to a group of studies or lot s of different scientific investigations about a similar topic. People will s ometimes say, “Well, the research says,” meaning the scientific studies indi cate or show that. However, we don’t say “researches.” That is not correct. If you  want to use the plural, you would have to say “research studies.”

Here we’re talking about a single study, just one s tudy, that found that people who use toasters have higher “incidence” (incidence s) of “tumors” (tumors). “Incidence” refers to how often something happens. It’s a word that is often used in talking about disease and health. The “incidence  of cancer” would be how many people or what percentage of people get cancer  in a certain area. A “tumor” is a part of the body that grows unexpected ly, often related to some disease, many times to cancer.

Eric, however, doesn’t think Vivian is correct. He says, “That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with my coffee.” “Coffee” is also  a popular drink in the morning. Vivian says, “You can’t use the coffee mak er, either. The use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.” Vivian is telli ng Eric that he cannot use the machine called a “coffee maker” that he uses to mak e his coffee every morning. Why? Because it is “linked (linked) to” heart disea se. “To be linked to” means it’s connected to or it’s related to. “Heart disease” re fers to medical conditions that cause the heart to have problems, potentially probl ems that could kill you.

Eric says, “Are you putting me on?” “To put someone  on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to fool or trick someone, to deceive s omeone, to make him believe something that isn’t true. Eric thinks Vivian is tr ying to make him believe something that she knows is not true, almost as a j oke. He says, “Where are you getting this junk science?” The term “junk” (junk) normally refers to garbage or trash – things you throw away or get rid of because  you no longer want them or need them. “Junk science,” however, refers to scien ce that is not of a very high quality or that is perhaps not done by people who a re trained scientists.

Vivian says, however, that she’s getting her inform ation from “very reputable sources.” “Reputable” (reputable) means respected, having a good reputation. We might talk about a “reputable car mechanic,” som eone who fixes cars. Someone who is reputable is someone who has a good reputation, someone who is supposed to be honest and qualified. A “sour ce” (source) is where you get information from. Some people use Wikipedia as a so urce of information. Other people get their information from newspapers. These  are “sources.” Some of them are reputable, some of them are less reputable .

Eric says, “I bet these so-called researchers are m aking sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexiste nt data.” Quite a few words and terms to explain in that sentence. Let’s begin with “sweeping” (sweeping). The word “sweeping” here refers to something that i s very broad, something that covers a lot of different things. In this case, it’ s used to apply to the word “conclusions.” A “conclusion” is what you believe t o be true after looking at different pieces of evidence, different facts. We o ften use the verb “to draw” (draw) with this word “conclusion.” “To draw a conc lusion” means to come to a decision about what is true or not true.

So, a “sweeping conclusion” then would be a conclus ion that covers or includes lots of different things. I may say, for example, t hat “All coffee makers make bad coffee.” That’s a “sweeping conclusion.” I am makin g a determination about what is true regarding a large number of things. Usually  sweeping conclusions are false; at least, when you hear that expression “swe eping conclusions,” the

person who is using it is probably indicating that the conclusion is false because it is trying to say too much or cover too many case s.

“Fraudulent” (fraudulent) means false, not true. “C laims” (claims) are statements or sentences about what you think is true. So, a “f raudulent claim” would be saying something that you know is false, especially  about a certain product or drug or other thing that is being sold. Eric thinks  these researchers are making “fraudulent claims” – that is, saying things they k now to be false “based on limited or nonexistent data.” “Data” (data) refers to facts  and statistics that are gathered or collected in order to try to reach a conclusion about something.

“Data” technically is a plural noun, although it is  now often used in the singular. The singular of “data” is “datum” (datum), from the  Latin. However, it has become quite common now for people to use “data” as a sing ular noun rather than a plural one. “Data is,” “data are” are both correct forms in English, at least in American English nowadays. “Nonexistent” (nonexiste nt) means it doesn’t exist. It’s not real. There is no, in this case, data. “No nexistent data” would be data that doesn’t exist – things that you basically made up.

Vivian says, “Stop!” Eric says, “What now? I’m open ing the refrigerator to get some milk.” Vivian says, “Refrigerators emit harmfu l rays that can be bad for your vision.” A “refrigerator” is a machine in your kitc hen to keep food cool. “To emit” (emit) means to produce something and send it out t o the surrounding area. We talk about a lightbulb “emitting” light – light com es from the bulb and goes out into the area around it. “Rays” (rays) are lines, if you  will, of heat or light that come from a single point. It’s a way we use to describe how light or other electromagnetic fields are transmitted. “Vision” (v ision) refers to your eyesight, your ability to see.

Vivian is saying that refrigerators, according to h er, emit or give out harmful rays that can be bad for your eyesight. Eric says, “Wait  a second,” meaning stop. “Are you having trouble sleeping again?” Vivian says, “A s a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.” Eric now realizes tha t Vivian hasn’t slept for three days, and that’s why she’s saying all of these weir d things. Vivian uses a very common expression, “as a matter (matter) of fact.” “As a matter of fact” is a phrase we use to emphasize the truth of what we are  about to say, especially if we are correcting what another person has said or s imply are adding additional information that we think is important or relevant.

Eric says, “I don’t need any research study to tell  me that people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts.” “Kooky” (kooky) is a wonderf ul word. It means crazy, weird, unusual, strange. All of those things can be  “kooky.” We usually use it to

refer to a person who has very strange ideas, very weird ideas – unusual ideas that are almost certainly wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed

[start of dialogue]

Vivian: Wait! Don’t use that toaster.

Eric: Why? I want some toast for breakfast.

Vivian: It isn’t safe. I’ve just read about a resea rch study that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.

Eric: That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with  my coffee.

Vivian: You can’t use the coffee maker, either. The  use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.

Eric: Are you putting me on? Where are you getting this junk science?

Vivian: From very reputable sources.

Eric: I bet these so-called researchers are making sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexistent d ata.

Vivian: Stop!

Eric: What now? I’m opening the refrigerator to get  some milk.

Vivian: Refrigerators emit harmful rays that can be  bad for your vision.

Eric: Wait a second. Are you having trouble sleepin g again?

Vivian: As a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.

Eric: I don’t need any research study to tell me th at people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts!

This episode is a dialogue between Oleg and Daria a bout taking a test, an examination, in order to get your driver’s license.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Oleg: I failed!

Daria: What?! How could you have failed your drivin g test again?

Oleg: I got nervous and I did everything wrong.

Daria: Like what?

Oleg: When I accelerated, I ground my gears and rac ed the engine. The car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off he r seat.

Daria: Oh, that’s bad.

Oleg: Yeah, I know. I failed to stop at a traffic l ight and changed lanes in the intersection without signaling.

Daria: Yikes.

Oleg: The examiner told me to back off because I wa s tailgating the car in front of me. She also pointed out the speed limit because I had been speeding.

Daria: It couldn’t have gone much worse, could it?

Oleg: Oh yes, it could have and it did. When she wa rned me about my speed, I got so flustered that I slammed on the brakes and n early caused an accident.

Daria: What did she say when that happened?

Oleg: She cried uncle and told me to take her back to the office as fast as humanly possible!

[end of dialogue]

Oleg says to Daria at the beginning of our dialogue , “I failed!” “To fail” (fail) means not to pass some test or examination, or simp ly to not obtain the result that you wanted to get – to not reach the goal you wanted to reach. “I failed to lose 20 pounds in one week.” If your goal was to lo se 20 pounds in one week and you didn’t, you would say you “failed,” though that is probably not a very realistic goal. We usually think of the verb “to fa il” as being opposite of the verb “to pass,” especially in school or related to some sort of test or examination.

Oleg failed. Daria says, “What?! How could you have  failed your driving test again?” We learn now that Oleg failed his driving t est. A “driving test” is an examination you must take in order to get a license  to drive. In the United States, each state has its own exam, its own test, and when  you move from one state to another, you often have to take the exam again, or at least the written exam, because there are actually two parts of the exam in  most states.

There is a test that you take I suppose nowadays on  a computer. I’m so old I remember taking the test using a piece of paper. If  you pass that test, then you have to take what’s called a “behind the wheel test ,” which means you get into a car with someone from the government and you have t o demonstrate, show that you know how to drive. It sounds as though Oleg fai led the “behind the wheel test,” or the test in the car.

Oleg says, “I got nervous and I did everything wron g.” Daria says, “Like what?” meaning “What did you do wrong?” Oleg explains, “Wh en I accelerated, I ground my gears and raced the engine. The car jerked so ha rd that the examiner nearly fell off her seat.” “To accelerate” (accelerate) me ans to increase in speed, especially when you put your foot on what’s called the “gas pedal” (pedal) in order to make the car go faster. We call that “acce lerating the car,” making the car go faster. The opposite of accelerate is “decel erate.”

Well, in Oleg’s case, when he accelerated, when he tried to make the car go faster by putting his foot on the gas pedal, he “gr ound the gears.” “To grind”

(grind) – “ground” is the past tense of “grind” – “ the gears” (gears) means to cause the car to make a loud noise as you change the gears from one to another, or go from one gear to another, I should s ay.

There are two basic kinds of cars. There are cars t hat have what is called a “manual (manual) transmission” and cars that have “ automatic transmissions.” In a manual transmission, you have to change gears as the car goes faster or slower, and you have to do that each time you accel erate or decelerate. In an automatic transmission, you don’t have to do any of  those things – at least, you don’t have to change gears from first gear to, say,  fourth or fifth gear.

Most American cars nowadays have automatic transmis sions, but I used to own a manual transmission, which we sometimes refer to as a “stick” (stick). A “stick” refers to the pole or stick that comes out of the t ransmission, into the center of the car that you use to change gears. So if someone  asks you if you know how to “drive a stick” or a “stick shift” (shift), the per son is referring to a car with a manual transition.

Oleg was driving a stick shift, or manual transmiss ion car, and he didn’t know how to shift or change gears properly. So when he a ccelerated, he “ground the gears” – basically he failed to put his foot proper ly on another pedal or piece of metal near your feet called the “clutch” (clutch). You put your foot on the clutch in order to change from one gear to another. If you do n’t do that correctly, you will end up grinding the gears, which is a very ugly sou nd.

Oleg says he “raced the engine” when he accelerated . “To race (race) the engine (engine)” means to take your car out of gear, we wo uld say – that is, put your car in “neutral” (neutral) so that the car isn’t in any  gear and then put your foot on the gas or your foot on the gas pedal, we would say. If  you do that, the “motor” or the “engine” of the car will move very fast. It will ma ke a loud noise but the car won’t move, because in order for the car to move, you hav e to be what we would describe as “in gear” – that is, you have to be or put the transmission into one of the gears – first, second, third, fourth, or, if yo u want to go backwards, reverse gear.

See, I’m teaching you how to drive as well as teach ing you English today. In any case, Oleg didn’t do a very good job. He says, “The  car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off her seat.” The verb “to je rk” (jerk) here means to move suddenly or unexpectedly. So, if the car “jerked,” it’s moved quickly without you being ready for it. The “examiner” is the person fr om the government who decides if you pass or fail the driving test. This poor examiner “nearly,” or almost, “fell off her seat,” meaning she almost went from h er seat to the floor of the car.

 Daria says, “Oh, that’s bad.” Oleg says, “Yeah, I k now. I failed to stop at a traffic light and changed lanes in the intersection without  signaling.” A “traffic light” is a light that tells you whether you should stop where two streets cross, or go. In the U.S. and in many countries, the color red means you  stop and green means you can go. If you don’t stop at a traffic light when t he light is red, that of course is very bad and dangerous, as well as being against the law. When Oleg says he “failed to stop at a traffic light,” he means the t raffic light was red and he was supposed to stop.

He also says he “changed lanes in the intersection. ” “Lanes” (lanes) are the different sections of the street or the freeway in which the cars move. The “lanes” are usually separated by painted lines on the stree t or highway. “To change lanes” means to go from one lane to the next. The “ intersection” (intersection) is where two streets cross, usually at a right or nine ty-degree angle. You’re not supposed to change lanes when you are in the middle  of an intersection.

Oleg also says that he “changed lanes without signa ling” (signaling). “To signal” means to turn on the lights in your car that blink,  or go on and off quickly, telling the other drivers what direction you’re going to mo ve. If you are going to move from one lane to another, you are supposed to turn your signal on so that a light goes on and off at the back and front of your car, telling other drivers that you are going to move lanes. Oleg says he changed lanes “wi thout signaling.” By the way, it doesn’t matter if you signal your lane chan ge in the middle of an intersection or not; it’s illegal in most states to  change lanes in an intersection even if you signal.

Daria says “Yikes,” which is an expression of surpr ise, usually at a bad thing. Oleg continues, “The examiner told me to back off b ecause I was tailgating the car in front of me.” “To back off” is a two-word ph rasal verb that here means to increase the distance between you and the person – or in this case, car – in front of you. If you are too close to the car in front of  you, we sometimes call that “tailgating” (tailgating). “To tailgate” means to f ollow another car too closely so that if the other car were to stop quickly, you mig ht cause an accident by hitting that car because you can’t stop quickly enough.

Here in Los Angeles, if you drive too slowly, cars will often tailgate you. They will come up right behind you to try to get you to move faster or to move to another lane so they can drive around you. Oleg was tailgat ing the car in front of him. The examiner also pointed out, or told him, the speed l imit of the road on which they were driving. The “speed limit” is the maximum spee d you can drive. In most freeways in the United States, you can drive betwee n 60 and 70 miles per hour.

In most city streets, the speed is much lower, from  25 to 40 miles an hour, typically.

The examiner pointed out the speed limit to Oleg be cause he had been “speeding.” “To speed” (speed) means to be driving faster than the speed limit – to be driving too fast. Daria says, “It couldn’t ha ve gone much worse, could it?” meaning this was probably the worst that Oleg could  have done. Oleg says, “Oh yes, it could have and it did,” meaning things actu ally got worse than what he has so far described.

He says, “When she,” the examiner, “warned me about  my speed, I got so flustered that I slammed on the brakes and nearly c aused an accident.” “To get flustered” (flustered) means to get confused or wor ried, usually because you are in a very stressful or difficult situation. Oleg go t flustered and “slammed (slammed) on the brakes (brakes).” The “brakes” are  what causes the car to slow down or stop.

“To slam on the brakes” means to put your foot very  quickly and with a lot of pressure on what is called the “brake pedal.” There  are basically three pieces of metal, called “pedals,” on the bottom of your car, near your feet. In most cars, there’s a gas pedal and a brake pedal, and in a man ual transmission or stick there is also a clutch pedal. Oleg slammed on the b rakes. He put his foot on the brake pedal very suddenly, and this nearly caused a n accident because the car stopped quickly and no doubt the car behind him had  difficulty stopping quickly as well.

Daria says, “What did she say when that happened?” Oleg says, “She” – again, the examiner – “cried uncle and told me to take her  back to the office as fast as humanly possible!” “To cry (cry) uncle (uncle)” is a somewhat unusual phrase. It means to end an activity suddenly or to end a game suddenly, usually allowing the other person to win.

“To cry uncle” or “to say uncle” is, some people th ink, a very old expression that comes from the Romans. It’s used when you are basic ally giving up, when you are saying to the other person, “You win.” It’s use d especially if the other person is forcing you to do something or you are doing so badly that you simply want to give up. Oleg said that the examiner “cried uncle.”  She gave up on this exam and told Oleg to take her back to the office “as fast a s humanly possible,” meaning very quickly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Oleg: I failed!

Daria: What?! How could you have failed your drivin g test again?

Oleg: I got nervous and I did everything wrong.

Daria: Like what?

Oleg: When I accelerated, I ground my gears and rac ed the engine. The car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off he r seat.

Daria: Oh, that’s bad.

Oleg: Yeah, I know. I failed to stop at a traffic l ight and changed lanes in the intersection without signaling.

# Bragging About Success With Men

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,263 – Bragging about Success with Men.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,263. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESLPod Spec ial Courses in business, daily, and cultural English.

This episode is a dialogue between Evan and Chantel le about a woman who is successful in getting men to be romantically intere sted in her. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Evan: Who are going out with tonight?

Chantelle: I’m not sure. I might go to dinner with Steve or Eduardo or Jim.

Evan: Dinner is in a couple of hours. You mean they ’re waiting around for your call?

Chantelle: They’d better be. They’re the ones vying  for my attention, so they’d better be at my beck and call.

Evan: How many guys are you juggling?

Chantelle: Not that many, only the ones who are rea lly devoted admirers. I try to throw them a bone now and then.

Evan: By keeping them waiting.

Chantelle: It’s good to keep them on their toes.

Evan: And by making them jealous of each other? I s aw how angry Jack got when he saw you flirting with Kwan and later gettin g cozy with Mike.

Chantelle: Jack can’t stay angry with me. We’ll kis s and make up.

Evan: Don’t you ever get tired of toying with so ma ny men?

 Chantelle: I’m not toying with them. It’s not my fa ult that men find me irresistible.

Evan: Right, just like moths to a flame. No wonder so many get burned!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about bragging. “To brag” (brag ) means to talk about how good you are at something, to tell other people how  great you are. In this episode, Chantelle is bragging about her success wi th men.

Evan begins our dialogue by asking her, “Who are yo u going out with tonight?” “To go out with” someone here means to go to some s ocial event such as a dinner or a movie or some party. “I’m going out wit h my friends” means I’m going to have a good time tonight doing something with my  friends. “To go out with” can also mean to be in a romantic relationship with  someone. “I’m going out with a girl I met at work last week.” Here, however, it just means to be with someone to have a good time.

Chantelle isn’t sure who she’s going out with tonig ht. She says, “I might go to dinner with Steve or Eduardo or Jim.” Evan says, “D inner is in a couple of hours,” meaning we are very close to the time when you woul d be going to dinner. “You mean they’re waiting around for your call?” “To wai t (wait) around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to wait for something to happe n, usually because you don’t have any other plans. “I’m waiting around for my fr iend to call.” I’m sitting here doing nothing else, really, because I don’t have an ything important to do other than wait for him to call me.

These men that Chantelle is interested in are waiti ng around for her to call. Chantelle says, “They’d better be,” meaning she exp ects them to be waiting around for her call. She continues, “They’re the on es vying for my attention, so they’d better be at my beck and call.” “To vie (vie ) for someone’s attention” means to try to get someone to pay attention to you , to try to get someone to notice you. Chantelle says that these three men are  “vying for her attention.” They want her to notice them.

Therefore, she says, “they’d better be at my beck ( beck) and call.” “To be at someone’s beck and call” means to be ready and will ing to do whatever someone asks you to do or wants you to do. Rich peo ple often have servants who are at their “beck and call.” The servants work  for them and do whatever they tell them to do. Chantelle thinks these men sh ould be at her beck and call, sort of like servants, I guess.

 Evan says, “How many guys are you juggling?” “To ju ggle” (juggle) here means to try to do many different things at the same time . Another meaning of “to juggle” is to take objects such as small balls and throw th em up in the air and keep them up in the air at the same time. Some people are abl e to juggle three, four, or five tennis balls at the same time, keeping them all up in the air. Here the verb is used, however, to mean to be able to do a lot of di fferent things at the same time.

In Chantelle’s case, she’s talking about the number  of different men who are interested in her and to whom she is thinking of pa ying attention. Chantelle says, “Not that many, only the ones who are really devote d admirers.” If someone is “devoted” (devoted) to something or to someone, he is interested in that thing or person and will spend a lot of time on it – or her,  in this case. An “admirer” (admirer) is someone who likes another person, in t his case in a romantic way. So Chantelle’s devoted admirers are men who are ver y interested in having a romantic relationship with her.

Chantelle continues, “I try to throw them a bone no w and then.” The expression “to throw someone a bone” (bone) means to give some one a small amount of what he or she wants or is asking for, but not what  they completely want or not everything that they want. The expression relates t o what you would do for a dog for example. You may be eating a nice juicy steak a nd the dog wants the steak. Well, you don’t give the dog the steak, the meat, b ut you might throw the dog the bone from the steak. It’s a small amount of what the dog likes.

“To throw someone a bone,” then, means to give him a little of what he wants so that he continues to be interested, but not everyth ing he wants. Chantelle says she likes “to keep” these men “on their toes.” “To keep someone on their toes” (toes) means to make someone pay attention, to keep  someone ready for something that might happen, something important th at might happen. “To keep someone on his toes” means to keep him focused, to keep him concentrated. Chantelle wants the men to be kept on their toes, m eaning they have to be ready to do what she says she wants them to do.

Evan says, “And by making them jealous of each othe r?” “To be jealous” (jealous) means to want what another person has. In  this case, “to be jealous” refers to the men each wanting what he thinks the o ther has, the attention of Chantelle. Evan says, “I saw how angry Jack got whe n he saw you flirting with Kwan and later getting cozy with Mike.” Men, as wel l as women, are sometimes jealous if the person whom they are attracted to or  are in love with shows attention to another person.

Chantelle was “flirting” with Kwan. “To flirt” (fli rt) means to show some sort of romantic interest in another person by what you say  or by what you do in a playful way, without any real seriousness perhaps b ehind it. Chantelle was “flirting with Kwan” and later “getting cozy with M ike,” another man. “To get cozy (cozy) with” someone means to be very close physica lly to that person, perhaps touching that person or putting your arm around tha t person or kissing that person.

Evan describes a situation in which Chantelle was w ith one man, Jack, but she was also flirting with Kwan and getting cozy with a  third man, Mike. This made Jack, understandably, angry. Chantelle says, howeve r, “Jack can’t stay angry with me,” meaning he won’t continue to be angry for  a long time. “We’ll kiss and make up,” she says. The expression “to kiss and mak e up means” to end an argument, especially between a romantic couple.

Then Evan asks her, “Don’t you ever get tired of to ying with so many men?” “To toy (toy) with” someone is to treat someone in a wa y that isn’t serious – in this case, to act as though you are romantically interes ted in someone when in fact you really aren’t. You’re playing with them. You’re  toying with them. That’s what Evan is accusing Chantelle of doing.

Chantelle disagrees. She says, “I’m not toying with  them. It’s not my fault,” meaning I am not to blame, “that men find me irresi stible.” “To be irresistible” (irresistible) means it is impossible to say no to something or to someone. In this case, it means that she is very, very beautiful, ve ry attractive, such that men cannot resist her. They can’t say no to her. Evan s ays, “Right, just like moths to a flame.” “Moths” (moths) are small flying insects th at have large wings – the things they move up and down to fly – that typically are f ound at night. They’re sort of like a butterfly but are usually white or gray.

Moths are attracted to sources of light. One source  of light is a “flame” (flame). A “flame” is what you get when you have a fire. The “ flames” of a fire are what you can see of the fire – that which is burning produce s heat and light. A moth is often attracted to light, and so may actually go in to a flame, and of course doing that will kill the moth. When a moth flies into a f ire or a flame, it gets burned. “To get burned,” means in one sense to have the fire ha rm the insect.

You can get burned if you put your hand into a fire , but here the expression has two meanings. It means literally the moths flying i nto the flame and being burned, but “to get burned” is also used as an expression i n a romantic relationship – or perhaps in any relationship, really – where one per son does something to harm

another person or another person gets harmed becaus e of the actions of the other.

In the case of Chantelle, the men are all intereste d in her and are attracted to her like moths to a flame, but also like moths to a fla me, they will get hurt by this attraction. All of us probably have gotten burned a t some point or another in our lives, especially if you vie for the attention of s omeone whom other people are also attracted to. There will be one winner and man y losers. That’s the way the world is, isn’t it?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Evan: Who are going out with tonight?

Chantelle: I’m not sure. I might go to dinner with Steve or Eduardo or Jim.

Evan: Dinner is in a couple of hours. You mean they ’re waiting around for your call?

Chantelle: They’d better be. They’re the ones vying  for my attention, so they’d better be at my beck and call.

Evan: How many guys are you juggling?

Chantelle: Not that many, only the ones who are rea lly devoted admirers. I try to throw them a bone now and then.

Evan: By keeping them waiting.

Chantelle: It’s good to keep them on their toes.

Evan: And by making them jealous of each other? I s aw how angry Jack got when he saw you flirting with Kwan and later gettin g cozy with Mike.

Chantelle: Jack can’t stay angry with me. We’ll kis s and make up.

Evan: Don’t you ever get tired of toying with so ma ny men?

Chantelle: I’m not toying with them. It’s not my fa ult that men find me irresistible.

 Evan: Right, just like moths to a flame. No wonder so many get burned!

This episode is a dialogue between Wynn and Dixie a bout getting rewarded for using a certain company. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wynn: I’ve come up with a surefire way to bring in more business.

Dixie: How?

Wynn: We’ll start a customer loyalty program. All of the big businesses have them.

Dixie: I’m not sure how they work.

Wynn: They’re mainly point-based systems. Our custo mers sign up and we’ll give them a membership card or keychain tag with a barco de. Each time they make a purchase, they get points. Once they’ve accumulated  enough points, they can redeem them for rewards.

Dixie: Okay, but what’s this?

Wynn: It’s a punch card. Each time a customer buys something over $25, they get a punch. When they’ve received 10 punches, they  get a $10 discount.

Dixie: I understand all that, but what is this char t for?

Wynn: It shows our new tiered system. Customers who  spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level, those who spend more than $5 ,000 are on the red level,

and those who spend $10,000 are on the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder.

Dixie: So which of these customer loyalty programs are we adopting?

Wynn: All of them.

Dixie: Huh? How are customers supposed to keep trac k of all of these programs?

Wynn: Good question. See this? It’s a free wallet we’ll be giving away. Customers can keep all of their customer loyalty ca rds in it. Isn’t it nice?

Dixie: It’s nice, but will people really use it?

Wynn: You’ve got a point. Maybe we should come up w ith a reward program for those who do. Hey, that’s brilliant!

Our dialogue begins with Wynn saying to Dixie, “I’v e come up with a surefire way to bring in more business.” “To come up with” somet hing is to invent or imagine or create something new. Wynn has created a “surefi re way.” “Surefire” (surefire) is something that is going to be successful, someth ing that cannot fail, cannot go wrong. Another word for this would be “foolproof” ( foolproof). Something that is “surefire” or “foolproof” will be successful no mat ter what.

Wynn has “a surefire way to bring in more business. ” “To bring in” means to get more people in this case to buy things at a store. Dixie says, “How?” Wynn says, “We’ll start a customer loyalty program.” A “custom er” is someone who buys something from a store or a company. “Loyalty” (loy alty) is the connection and the support you have for someone or to someone. If I am “loyal” to you, I will help you even if it’s difficult, or I will always suppor t you and not someone else.

“Customer loyalty programs” are things that compani es design, companies create, to get their customers – the people who buy  things from them – to return to them, and they do this by giving the customers s omething extra. Sometimes it’s extra discounts. Some companies will give you a certain number of points that you can collect, and if you get so many points you then get a free item from that store. Coffee shops, for example, will often have l ittle cards they give you, and each time you buy a drink, they put something on your card that shows you bought a drink, and after 10 drinks you get a free drink. That’s what happens at my local coffee shop here in Los Angeles.

 Wynn, then, wants to start a customer loyalty progr am. He says, “All of the big businesses have them.” Dixie says, “I’m not sure ho w they work.” Then Wynn explains how a customer loyalty program works. He s ays, “They’re mainly,” or primarily, “point-based systems,” meaning you get a  point for every time you buy something or perhaps a point for every dollar you s pend. “Our customers,” Wynn continues, “sign up” – or register – “and we’ll giv e them a membership card or keychain tag with a barcode.”

A “membership card” is usually a paper or plastic c ard, sort of like a credit card. A “keychain” (keychain) is something that you use t o put your keys on when you put them in your pocket or purse. A “tag” (tag) is like a little small card that goes on your keychain. These cards or tags usually have a “barcode” (barcode) on the back of them. A barcode is a series of thin and thi ck lines that can be read by a special computer.

“Each time they make a purchase,” Wynn says, “they”  – meaning the customers – “get points. Once they’ve accumulated enough poin ts, they can redeem them for rewards.” “To accumulate” (accumulate) means to  gather or to increase the number of something by adding to it a little at a t ime. “To accumulate enough points” means to get enough points because you’ve g one to the store over and over again.

“Once they’ve accumulated enough points,” Wynn expl ains, “they can redeem (redeem) them for rewards (rewards).” “To redeem” m eans to exchange something usually for a price or a reward. If you g o to Las Vegas or a casino where there is gambling, they usually will give you  small, round objects, called in English “chips” (chips). These “chips” are used for  gambling at, say, the poker table. When you are done at the end of the night, i f you still have any left, you take those chips in and you “cash them in,” or we m ight use the verb “redeem” them for money.

Normally, however, the verb “redeem” is used when s omeone gives you something that you can then exchange for or give to  someone else to get money or some other prize or reward. If you buy a lottery  ticket and you win, you can redeem that little piece of paper with the correct numbers on it for a million dollars or however much you won. By the way, congra tulations if you did win. I’d be happy to help you spend that money.

Anyway, we’re not redeeming lottery tickets here. W e’re redeeming points for rewards. A “reward” is a prize, something you get f or free because you’ve done something well or because you’ve won some competiti on. Dixie says, “Okay, but

what’s this?” She is showing Wynn something. Wynn s ays, “It’s a punch card.” A “punch (punch) card” is a small paper card in which  there are a series of holes made every time you buy something. There’s a small device to make holes in paper called a “punch,” and when you put the piece of paper in this little device, it makes a hole in it.

Wynn says, “Each time a customer buys something ove r $25,” meaning worth more than $25, “they get a punch. When they’ve rece ived 10 punches, they get a $10 discount” (discount). A “discount” is a reducti on in the price of something. Sometimes it’s a percentage reduction. Sometimes it ’s an actual dollar amount. Here it’s a $10 discount. Dixie says, “I understand  all that, but what is this chart for?” A “chart” (chart) is an organized way of pres enting information. Sometimes it will have a table on it. Sometimes it will have a graphs on it.

Wynn says, “It shows our new tiered system.” This c hart he’s looking at, then, shows their “new tiered (tiered) system.” “Tiered” refers to something with many different levels or steps. Wynn explains, “Customer s who spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level,” or we might say “blue tier,” since “tier” (tier) is just another word for “level.” “Those who spend more tha n $5,000,” Wynn says, “are on the red level, and those who spend $10,000 are o n the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder.”

An “incentive” (incentive) is something that motiva tes you to do something. An incentive makes you want to do something. It may be  money. It may be power. It may be the possibility of going on a date with a be autiful woman. That might be an incentive for you to go to the gym and get big m uscles like me. Well, not like me. I don’t need any more beautiful women. I have m y wife.

Anyway, Wynn is talking about “incentives to get pe ople to move up the ladder” (ladder). “To move up the ladder” here means to inc rease in value or to go up to the next level – from the blue level, to the red le vel, to the gold level. Dixie says, “So which of these customer loyalty programs are we  adopting?” “To adopt” (adopt) here means simply to decide to use or to be gin to use. Wynn answers, “All of them.”

Dixie is confused. She says. “Huh?” That’s a way we  indicate confusion in English, “huh?” “How are customers supposed to keep  track of all of these programs?” she asks. “To keep track (track) of” som ething is a phrasal verb meaning to know the details of something as things change. Usually we use this phrase when we are talking about a complicated syst em, as this apparently is.

Wynn says, “Good question. See this? It’s a free wa llet we’ll be giving away.” A “wallet” (wallet) is something that a man or woman uses to put his or her money and credit cards in. Wynn is showing Dixie these wa llets, or a wallet, and telling her that they’re going to be giving them away. They ’re going to be giving them to their customers for free. “Customers,” he says, “ca n keep all of their customer loyalty cards in it. Isn’t it nice?” Dixie says, “I t’s nice but will people really use it?”

Wynn says, “You’ve got a point.” “You’ve got a poin t” means you are right about that. He says, “Maybe we should come up with a rewa rd program for those who do.” In other words, he’s going to give them the wa llet so they can keep all of these cards in – that is, the customers can keep al l of these reward cards in. After Dixie points out that maybe customers won’t u se the wallet, Wynn says they’ll create another loyalty program, another rew ard program for those who do use the wallet. He says, “Hey, that’s brilliant,” m eaning that’s very clever. That’s smart. That’s very intelligent.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Wynn: I’ve come up with a surefire way to bring in more business.

Dixie: How?

Wynn: We’ll start a customer loyalty program. All of the big businesses have them.

Dixie: I’m not sure how they work.

Wynn: They’re mainly point-based systems. Our custo mers sign up and we’ll give them a membership card or keychain tag with a barco de. Each time they make a purchase, they get points. Once they’ve accumulated  enough points, they can redeem them for rewards.

Dixie: Okay, but what’s this?

Wynn: It’s a punch card. Each time a customer buys something over $25, they get a punch. When they’ve received 10 punches, they  get a $10 discount.

Dixie: I understand all that, but what is this char t for?

 Wynn: It shows our new tiered system. Customers who  spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level, those who spend more than $5 ,000 are on the red level, and those who spend $10,000 are on the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder.

Dixie: So which of these customer loyalty programs are we adopting?

Wynn: All of them.

Dixie: Huh? How are customers supposed to keep trac k of all of these programs?

Wynn: Good question. See this? It’s a free wallet we’ll be giving away. Customers can keep all of their customer loyalty ca rds in it. Isn’t it nice?

Dixie: It’s nice, but will people really use it?

Wynn: You’ve got a point. Maybe we should come up w ith a reward program for those who do. Hey, that’s brilliant!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,265. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development right here in beautiful Los Angeles, California. That’s h ow they say it in Great Britain – “Los Angeles,” with the last syllable being like the word “please” – but here in L.A. we say “Los Angeles.” So, get it right, Brits.

Anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah. Go to our website at  ESLPod.com and become a member of this podcast. You can download our Learning Guides. If you do, take a look at our ESL Podcast Store for additional  courses in business, daily, and cultural English. And like us on Facebook. Go t o facebook.com/eslpod.

This dialogue is between Adrian and Paul about watc hing two men fight. Sounds fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adrian: Hey, there’s a fight going on outside. Let’ s go!

Paul: Those guys are really going at it.

Adrian: Yeah, they’re going all out. Did you see th at? He just sucker punched the other guy.

Paul: They’re not really fighting fair, are they?

Adrian: No, this is a knock-down, drag-out fight – the best kind! Deck him!

Paul: I don’t really want to watch these guys pumme ling each other. Want to go?

Adrian: Are you kidding?! This is the best entertai nment I’ve seen in months. Nice uppercut, but watch out for the other guy’s ja b. Oh, he just took a bad blow to the head.

Paul: This is getting ugly. Next we’ll get hair pul ling.

Adrian: Oh, did you see that head-butt? I think we have a knockout.

Paul: Okay, if that’s true, then the fight is over.  Can we leave now?

Adrian: Wait! The guy is getting up. I think we mig ht get a second round. Hey, where are you going? You don’t have the stomach for  a little fight?

Paul: It’s not the fight. What I can’t stomach is b eing around someone who is as bloodthirsty as you are!

[end of dialogue]

Adrian begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “Hey,  there’s a fight going on outside.” A “fight” is when two people try to hurt each other, often by hitting each other. You can have a fight that is just “verbal” ( verbal). That’s when two people are often yelling at each other, disagreeing with e ach other but not hitting each other. When they start to hit each other, we would call that a “physical fight.”

Paul says, “Those guys are really going at it.” The  expression “to go at it” means to be completely involved in something with a lot of enthusiasm. Adrian says, “Yeah, they’re going all out.” “To go all out” mean s to do something without hesitation or limitation, to do something fully, of ten in a somewhat extreme way. “To go at it” and “to go all out” could describe the same situation, as it does here. The meanings are slightly different. “To go at it” means to begin something with a lot of enthusiasm. “To go all out” means to do the most you possibly can. So they’re slightly different in meaning.

In any case, Adrian then says to Paul, “Did you see  that?” indicating something that just happened during the fight, apparently, wh ere these two men are hitting each other. Adrian says, “He just sucker punched the other guy.” “To sucker (sucker) punch (punch)” someone is to hit someone w hen he is not expecting it, in a somewhat unfair way, I guess we would say. The  verb “to punch” means to hit someone with your closed hand, what we would ca ll your “fist” (fist). In fact, there’s a way of describing a fight such as the one  in the dialogue which is a “fistfight,” when two people hit each other mostly with their closed hands, their fists.

After Adrian comments on one guy sucker punching the other, Paul says, “They’re not really fighting fair, are they?” “To f ight fair” (fair) means to agree to fight in a way that is somehow following certain ru les. It may seem a little strange to talk about “fighting fair,” but when people figh t in a boxing match, there are definitely rules for things you can do and not do w hen you are fighting the other person. When two men are angry with each other and start hitting each other,

most people don’t think about rules that might gove rn or be applicable to the fight.

Adrian says, “No,” meaning no, they’re not fighting  fair. “This is a knock-down, drag-out fight.” “The expression “knock (knock) – d own, drag (drag) – out” refers to a kind of fighting where everything is acceptabl e. There are no rules. There are no restrictions. Adrian appears to really be en joying this fight. She calls a knock-down, drag-out fight “the best kind.” Then sh e yells at the men, or at one of them, “Deck him!” “To deck” (deck) someone is an  informal way of saying to punch or hit someone very hard, often so hard that the person falls down on the ground.

Paul says, “I don’t really want to watch these guys  pummeling each other.” “To pummel” (pummel) is to punch or hit someone many ti mes repeatedly with your fist. Paul says to Adrian, “Want to go?” Adrian say s, “Are you kidding?!” She, of course, doesn’t want to go. She says, “This is the best entertainment I’ve seen in months.” Then she goes back to watching the fight a nd starts to comment on how the two men are fighting each other. She says, “Nice uppercut.” An “uppercut (uppercut)”  is a kind of punch that is used in boxing or in a fistfight like this, where y ou use your arm to hit the other man’s face by bringing your fist from down below wh ere your, say, waist is and up into the face. So you are hitting the face from down below. That’s an “uppercut.” Another kind of punch or way of hitting  someone is called a “jab” (jab). A jab is a very quick hit with your fist. Yo u move your arm in and out very quickly when you hit the or try to hit the face of the person you’re fighting.

“Oh,” Adrian says, “he just took a bad blow to the head.” A “blow” (blow) here refers to a strong hit, a strong punch. A “blow to the head” means that the other fighter has hit him in the head hard. Paul then com ments, “This is getting ugly.” The expression “to get ugly” (ugly) means that the situation is becoming worse. It’s becoming very unpleasant. If you describe some thing as “getting ugly,” you mean that it’s getting to be very serious in a bad way and in a very unpleasant, not nice way.

Paul says, “Next we’ll get,” meaning we will see in  this fight, “hair pulling.” “To pull someone’s hair” means, of course, to take your  hand and to grab the hair on the head of the person and pull it. This is very di fficult if you fight me. You won’t be able to pull my hair. So, I have that advantage.

Anyway, Adrian says, “Oh, did you see that head-but t?” A “head” (head) is what you have on top of your body where your brain is su pposed to be – although not everyone has a brain in their head, such as one of my neighbors, for example.

“To butt” (butt) means to hit something hard. So a “head-butt” would be to hit someone hard with the top of your head or the front  of your head. In the game of soccer, what the rest of the world calls “football, ” you can have a head-butt by hitting the ball with your head – or at least, I th ink that’s possible.

Adrian finishes her commentary by saying, “I think we have a knockout.” A “knockout” (knockout) is when a fight ends when one  of the two people fighting falls on the ground and doesn’t get up. Paul says, “Okay, if that’s true then the fight is over. Can we leave now?” Adrian says, “Wai t! The guy is getting up,” meaning the guy was knocked onto the floor, he fell  down onto the floor, but now he’s getting up. “I think we may have a second roun d,” she says.

In a boxing match, where two men (or two women nowa days) wear special gloves on their hands and hit each other following certain rules, there are different parts of the fight, and those parts of the fight are called “rounds.” A “round” is a certain number of minutes during which  the two fighters hit each other, and then they stop and they take a break for  a short amount of time and then they start fighting again, and each one of tho se divisions or parts of the fight is called a “round” (round).

“Hey,” Adrian says, “where you going? You don’t hav e the stomach for a little fight?” she says. Paul is getting up and leaving an d Adrian wants to know if he “has the stomach (stomach) for” a fight. “To have t he stomach for” something is an expression we use to mean to have the ability to  tolerate a difficult situation or a situation that is unpleasant, uncomfortable, or m aybe even painful. Paul says, “It’s not the fight,” meaning he’s not bothered by the fight itself. “What I can’t stomach,” he says – what I can’t tolerate or what I  find too unpleasant – “is being around someone,” being close to someone, “who is as  bloodthirsty as you are!”

Paul’s problem is not with the fight but with Adria n, because he thinks she is “bloodthirsty” (bloodthirsty). “To be bloodthirsty”  means to enjoy violence, to like violence, to like seeing other people get hurt or p ossibly even to spill their blood – when you see blood because two people are hitting e ach other and you enjoy that. That’s what Paul’s problem is, and I think he ’s probably right.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adrian: Hey, there’s a fight going on outside. Let’ s go!

Paul: Those guys are really going at it.

 Adrian: Yeah, they’re going all out. Did you see th at? He just sucker punched the other guy.

Paul: They’re not really fighting fair, are they?

# Being a Refugee

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,266 – Being a Refugee.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,266. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California (beautiful Los An geles, beautiful Los Angeles, beautiful Los Angeles, California).

Go to ESLPod.com and become a member of ESL Podcast . When you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this episode th at contains not only a complete transcript of everything we say, but also a complete list of all of the important vocabulary words with their definitions a nd additional sample sentences. You also get a culture note and addition al words and meanings we don’t talk about on the audio part of this lesson.

This lesson is all about being a refugee – someone who has to leave his country. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sara: How’s work been?

Tarek: Really hard. Our agency is working to resett le refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there.

Sara: It must be so difficult to be displaced and h ave few possessions.

Tarek: You don’t know the half of it. Some are in r efugee camps and some are in detention centers. They’re overcrowded and the alre ady poor conditions are deteriorating. There simply isn’t an infrastructure  to support an influx this big.

Sara: At least they’re under protection until they can be resettled.

Tarek: If they’re resettled. If we can’t find count ries willing to take them, they may be repatriated.

Sara: But what if they won’t go back?

Tarek: Then they’ll be stateless. There aren’t many  good options for asylum seekers.

 Sara: I feel so bad for everyone in McQuillanland.

Tarek: I totally agree. You’re damned if you leave and damned if you stay!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Sara saying to Tarek, “How ’s work been?” meaning “How is your job going?” or “How are things at your  workplace?” Tarek says, “Really hard,” meaning very difficult. “Our agency”  – our organization within the government or private organization – “is working to  resettle refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict th ere.”

A “refugee,” or “refugee” – either pronunciation is  correct, whether the accent is on the first syllable or the last – is a person who  has to leave his country, usually because of some violence or threat of violence – th at is, that person might be killed if he doesn’t leave his country, by the gove rnment or someone else in the country.

The verb “to resettle” (resettle) means to help som eone find a new place to live. It could be in a new country, it could just be in a ne w city, or you might even use it to talk about just moving to a different house or a partment. “I need to get resettled in my new apartment.” I need to get every thing arranged so that I can live here. Here, we’re talking about “resettling re fugees” – helping people from another country come and live in our country.

The verb form “fled” (fled) comes from the verb, is  the past tense of the verb “to flee” (flee). “To flee” means to leave a place very  quickly, especially when you are in danger. If your house is on fire, if it is b urning up, you will need to “flee” as quickly as possible. You will need to leave it as q uickly as possible. There’s another word pronounced the same in English but spe lled differently, “flea” (flea), that’s actually a little, I guess it’s an insect or  a bug, a little animal that often lives on dogs or cats, though they can also bite people a s well, but this “flee” means to leave quickly.

An “armed (armed) conflict (conflict)” refers to tw o groups fighting each other with “arms” (arms). Now when I say “arms” here, I don’t mean the two things that come out of the top of your body with hands at the end of them. I’m referring to guns or other ways of killing people, such as bombs , that are used in a war. An “armed conflict” is really just another term for a war. So, to review then, Tarek works for an “agency,” a group that “is working to resettle refugees who have fled

McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there,”  meaning there is a war in McQuillanland.

Sara says, “It must be so difficult to be displaced  and have few possessions.” “To be displaced” (displaced) means to be forced to lea ve your home and live somewhere else. You may be “displaced” because of a  bad storm – maybe there’s too much rain in your area and the water ha s gone into the houses, what we would call “flooding.” That may lead to people b eing “displaced” – having to live somewhere else. “Possessions” (possessions) re fers to anything you own – your clothing, your cars, your computers, and so fo rth.

Sara says, “It must be so difficult,” or very diffi cult, “to be displaced and have few,” or not very many, “possessions.” Tarek says, “You don’t know the half of it.” That expression, “You don’t know the half (half) of  it,” means that you don’t have the complete information. Usually it means that thi ngs are actually worse than what you know, that you don’t have the information about how bad things are.

Tarek then describes that “some are in refugee camp s,” meaning some of these refugees are in “refugee camps” (camps). These are temporary places where people are kept when there is no other place to put  them. “Some are in detention centers,” Tarek says. A “detention (detention) cent er” is usually a place where people are forced to stay until the government deci des where they should go next, especially if they have perhaps, entered the country illegally or when the government is deciding to let or not let those peop le into the country permanently.

Tarek says, “These places are overcrowded and the a lready poor conditions are deteriorating.” If something is “overcrowded” (over crowded), there are too many people there. What’s the difference between “crowde d” and “overcrowded”? Well, “crowded” usually refers to a situation where there  are a lot of people in a small space, but there’s enough room, I guess, for you to  be more or less comfortable. “Overcrowded” means there are too many people in a certain area or space – so many people, perhaps, that it is dangerous.

The conditions or the situation in these places, ac cording to Tarek, “are deteriorating.” “To deteriorate” (deteriorate) mean s to get worse. He says, “There simply isn’t an infrastructure to support an influx  this big.” The word “infrastructure” (infrastructure) is used to descri be the systems or organizations, or perhaps physical structures, that allow somethin g to work properly or that allow society or a large group of people to functio n, to do what they need to do.

We often talk about the “infrastructure of a countr y” when describing the airports and roads and public services that are available so  that people can live comfortably and have a healthy economy, but “infras tructure” can also refer simply to the organization or the physical features  of a certain place. Tarek says that there “isn’t an infrastructure to support an i nflux (influx) this big.” An “influx” is when there is a large number of people who arrive o r enter into a certain place all at once or within a very short amount of time.

Sara says, “At least they’re under protection until  they can be resettled.” “Protection” refers to things that prevent you or s omeone from being hurt or harmed. Tarek says, “If they’re resettled,” meaning  he’s not sure if they will be, in fact, resettled. “If we can’t find countries willin g to take them, they may be repatriated.” “To repatriate” (repatriate) means to  return someone to his own country – someone who has left that country as a re fugee or for some other reason. So, if a person is “repatriated,” he is ret urned, often against his will, to the country from which he came.

Sara says, “But what if they won’t go back?” That i s, what if these refugees won’t return to their home countries? Tarek says, “Then t hey’ll be stateless” (stateless). Someone who is “stateless” is someone without a sta te or country or nation, or at least someone who is not recognized by any country as being a citizen or official member of that country.

Tarek says, “There aren’t many good options,” or go od possibilities, “for asylum seekers.” “Asylum” (asylum) here refers to giving s omeone safety by allowing him to stay in a country. A “seeker” (seeker) is so meone who is asking for something or looking for something or trying to get  something. The verb “to seek” means to look for, to try to find something. An “as ylum seeker” is someone who goes to another country and tries to get permission  to stay in that country, often because that person feels he won’t be safe in his o wn country.

Sara says, “I feel so bad for everyone in McQuillan land.” Tarek says, “I totally agree.” The word “totally” here means simply “I agr ee completely.” “You’re damned if you leave and damned if you stay,” he say s. The word “damned” (damned) here means that you will suffer or bad thi ngs will happen to you. That’s why he says, “You’re damned if you leave and damned  if you stay,” meaning if you stay in McQuillanland, things will be bad for y ou. If you leave McQuillanland, things will be bad for you. There are no good choic es. There are no good options.

Now let me just say that this is a fictional story.  Things in McQuillanland are actually wonderful, and I invite everyone to come a nd take your next vacation in beautiful McQuillanland.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sara: How’s work been?

Tarek: Really hard. Our agency is working to resett le refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there.

Sara: It must be so difficult to be displaced and h ave few possessions.

This episode is a dialogue between Lillian and Amos  about different kinds of nurses – people who help you in a hospital or at a doctor’s office or wherever you find them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lillian: I’d like to become a nurse like you. I wou ld have a great bedside manner.

Amos: It’s a difficult job, but I like it. I’m a re gistered nurse, but there are a lot of different types of nurses. If you’re willing to get  an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a nurse pract itioner.

Lillian: I don’t think I want to spend a lot of tim e in school.

Amos: Then you just need a little more training aft er your bachelor’s degree. You can be a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse , emergency room nurse, operating room nurse, critical care or intensive ca re nurse, or a home care nurse.

Lillian: Well, I dropped out of college. I just cou ldn’t hack it.

Amos: Hmm, then you might want to consider becoming  a certified nursing assistant. You’ll still need to go through a traini ng program, though, and to become certified.

Lillian: That still sounds like a lot of studying.

Amos: You do want to work in nursing, don’t you?

Lillian: I do, but I thought all I’d have to do is serve meals, talk to the patients, and make them comfortable. That’s what they do on T V.

Amos: Then my advice to you is to become an actor a nd play a nurse on TV. I think that might be the closest you’re going to get  to the nursing profession.

[end of dialogue]

Lillian begins by saying to Amos, “I’d like to beco me a nurse like you. I would have a great bedside manner.” The expression “bedsi de (bedside) manner (manner)” is used to refer to the way in which a do ctor, a nurse, or some other medical professional helps people who are sick when  they are sick. The word “bedside” means being next to or on the side of you r bed in a hospital when you are ill or sick. “Bedside manner” refers to how wel l a doctor or a nurse or someone else can talk to you and relate to you as a  patient, as someone who is sick.

Amos says that being a nurse is “a difficult job.” It’s hard to define the word “nurse.” A nurse does a lot of different things. Us ually nurses work with doctors who have medical degrees and pass tests that allow them to do certain things with people in terms of helping them become better or helping them get over illnesses. A nurse is someone who also has a degree  – goes and studies and passes exams or tests to help people who are sick. But a nurse can’t do many of the things that a doctor can do.

Amos says that he’s a “registered nurse.” There are  different kinds of nurses in the United States. One kind is called a “registered  (registered) nurse,” sometimes abbreviated with the letters “RN.” A registered nur se is someone who studies nursing as what we would call an “undergraduate” – that is, they go to college usually for four years and then they take an examin ation and get their permission to work as an RN. Although Amos is an RN, he explai ns that there are a lot of different types of nurses. He says, “If you’re will ing to get an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a n urse practitioner.”

The term “advanced degree” refers to a degree or an  academic certification that goes beyond a four-year undergraduate or bachelor’s  degree. So, if you study for four years and you get a bachelor’s degree, and the n you decide you want to get something above a bachelor’s degree, you would stud y an additional one or two years and get, for example, a master’s degree. You could then continue studying, as I did, and get a PhD or a doctorate, or you coul d get an MD, which is a medical degree that makes you a medical doctor.

A “PhD” is someone who usually does research, who i s involved in theoretical issues, who is trying to create new knowledge by st udying and researching something. A “medical doctor” is a practical degree , someone who actually takes knowledge, scientific knowledge, and applies it in a real world setting with the person – or as my old professor used to say, “The P hDs design the cars and the MDs fix them.” I suspect most medical doctors don’t  agree with that analogy or comparison. Anyway, I’m getting myself in trouble w ith all the doctors out there. The medical doctors, that is.

The advanced degree Amos is talking about is not to  become a doctor, but to become either a “clinical nurse specialist” or a “n urse practitioner.” A “clinical (clinical) nurse specialist” is someone who studies  one particular area of medicine that interests him and then gets some sort  of degree or certificate in that area. It might be someone who likes working sp ecifically with children, or someone who likes working specifically with certain  diseases of the heart. A “clinical nurse specialist,” then, is someone who s tudies beyond just the required knowledge needed to become a registered nurse and g ets extra knowledge about one area.

A “nurse practitioner” (practitioner) is, in some w ays, the highest level for a nurse, in the sense that a nurse practitioner is able to d o some of the things that a doctor does, such as looking at you and trying to i dentify (or we would use the word “diagnose”) what’s wrong with you. A nurse pra ctitioner can also give you certain kinds of medicine. I had a nurse practition er at one of the local medical clinics that I used to go to many years ago and he was very good. He was almost as good as the doctor that I had, and in some ways better.

Lillian says, however, “I don’t think I want to spe nd a lot of time in school.” Amos says, “Then you just need a little more training af ter your bachelor’s degree.” A “bachelor’s degree” is what you get after studying in college for four years – after being what we would describe as an “undergraduate.”  So when you graduate high school in the United States and you want to ge t a college degree, you go and study usually for four years, sometimes more, a nd you get a “bachelor’s degree.”

Amos is telling Lillian that she doesn’t have to st udy all that much beyond her four-year degree. She could become a “licensed prac tical nurse,” an “emergency room nurse,” an “operating room nurse,” a “critical  care or intensive care nurse,” or a “home care nurse.” These are all different spe cialties in the field or area of nursing.

A “licensed practical nurse” is someone who works w ith a registered nurse – someone who doesn’t have the same amount of trainin g as a registered nurse. An “emergency room nurse” is someone who works, log ically, in an emergency room. An “emergency room” is the place in a hospita l where you go when you need medical treatment or to be seen by a doctor im mediately. If you break your leg or burn your hand, you would go to the emergenc y room so that they could look at you right away. There are nurses who are sp ecialists in that area.

An “operating room nurse” is someone who works with  doctors who are doing surgeries. An “operating room” is a place where the  doctor will usually take a knife and cut you open or somehow make a hole in your body to try to fix what’s wrong with your body. When the doctor goes inside y our body somehow to fix you, that is called an “operation,” and it typicall y happens in an “operating room.”

“Intensive” or “critical care” refers to when you a re very sick, close to dying, and the hospital needs to watch you very carefully. Tha t’s called “intensive (intensive) care” or “critical (critical) care.” Again, there a re nurses that specialize or are experts in that one area. There are also “home care  nurses.” A home care nurse is someone who goes to your house or apartment or c ondominium, or wherever you live, and gives you help there – takes care of you there. You may be there because you can’t go to the hospital. More typicall y it’s for someone who was in a hospital and is then sent home but needs some add itional help from the nurse.

Lillian says, “Well, I dropped out of college.” “To  drop out of” something means to stop participating in some activity. In this case, Lillian is saying that she dropped out of college, meaning she went to college maybe f or a year or two but then stopped before she got her bachelor’s degree. Amos is talking about all of these kinds of nurses that require – many, but not all of  them – a bachelor’s degree.

Lillian says she doesn’t have one. She says she “co uldn’t hack it.” The expression “to hack (hack) it” means to be able to do something that is difficult, to be successful at a difficult job or task. If someon e says, “I can’t hack it,” he means I can’t do it. It’s too hard for me. Lillian says it was too hard for her to go to college. Amos says, “Hmm, then you might want to  consider becoming a certified nursing assistant.” The word “certified” (certified) refers to someone who passes a test or is somehow shown to be able to do something. An “assistant” is someone who helps another person.

A “certified nursing assistant” is someone who is n ot a registered nurse but has studied something about nursing – enough to help nu rses do what they do. There are the nurses who do not go to school for four yea rs, who may only study for a year and a half or two years and get another kind of certificate or permission to

work as a nurse, but not doing all of the things th at a registered nurse can do. A certified nursing assistant is an example of that.

Amos says, “You’ll still need to go through a train ing program to become certified” – that is, you have to get permission af ter passing a test and studying. Lillian says, “That sounds like a lot of studying.”  Amos says, “You do want to work in nursing, don’t you?” Amos is beginning to w onder whether Lillian actually wants to become a nurse at all, at any level. Lilli an says, “I do, but I thought all I’d have to do is serve meals,” meaning give people foo d, “talk to patients” – that is, talk to the people who are sick – “and make them co mfortable. That’s what they do on TV.”

So now we understand Lillian has been watching tele vision and she only sees nurses doing these things in hospitals and doesn’t realize that, of course, they have to study, go to college, and pass examinations  to become nurses. Amos says, “Then my advice to you” – what I would sugges t to you – “is to become an actor and play a nurse on TV.” Amos is saying well,  if you want to do what they do on TV, then you should just become an actor and pretend to be a nurse.

“I think that might be the closest you’re going to get to the nursing profession,” Amos says. A “profession” (profession) is a job tha t you get paid to do that usually requires some education, training, and expe rience. A “profession” is a kind of job. We talk about the “teaching profession ,” or the “nursing profession,” or more generally, the “medical profession.” These terms simply refer to the jobs that are related to that particular area.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lillian: I’d like to become a nurse like you. I wou ld have a great bedside manner.

Amos: It’s a difficult job, but I like it. I’m a re gistered nurse, but there are a lot of different types of nurses. If you’re willing to get  an advanced degree, you could become a clinical nurse specialist or a nurse pract itioner.

Lillian: I don’t think I want to spend a lot of tim e in school.

Amos: Then you just need a little more training aft er your bachelor’s degree. You can be a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse , emergency room nurse, operating room nurse, critical care or intensive ca re nurse, or a home care nurse.

 Lillian: Well, I dropped out of college. I just cou ldn’t hack it.

Amos: Hmm, then you might want to consider becoming  a certified nursing assistant. You’ll still need to go through a traini ng program, though, and to become certified.

Lillian: That still sounds like a lot of studying.

Amos: You do want to work in nursing, don’t you?

# Conducting Employee Background Checks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,268 – Conducting Employee Background Checks.

This episode is a dialogue between Vanessa and Dani el about investigating the history of someone you may want to hire to work at your company. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: I can’t wait until the new employees start  work. We need the help.

Daniel: It won’t be for a while. Background checks have to be done first.

Vanessa: Background checks? Are those really necess ary?

Daniel: You’d be surprised. We’ve been burned befor e. We don’t want to hire anyone with prior instances of negligence or anyone  else who has been involved in a corporate scandal. Sometimes we even get peopl e with fraudulent credentials.

Vanessa: Isn’t a background check kind of invasive?  What do they check for, a criminal record?

Daniel: Yes, but that’s just the beginning. Investi gators check driving records, credit reports, school transcripts, sex offender li sts, and much more.

Vanessa: I had no idea.

Daniel: When someone runs your Social Security numb er, all kinds of things come up. Investigators also check court records and  medical records.

Vanessa: That’s amazing.

Daniel: On top of all that, they often speak with p ast employers and character references.

Vanessa: And the new hires are okay with the compan y doing this kind of invasive background check?

Daniel: You were.

Vanessa: Me?! You mean they ran a background check on me before I was hired?

Daniel: You bet.

Vanessa: So they know all about . . .

Daniel: What?

Vanessa: Forget it.

[end of dialogue]

Today’s episode is called “Conducting Employee Back ground Checks.” “To conduct” (conduct) here means to do, to carry out, a certain action. The action here relates to employees. An “employee” is someone  who works for a company. The person who owns the company is called the “empl oyer,” and the person who works for the employer is the “employee.” Vanessa b egins by saying, “I can’t wait until the new employees start work. We need help.” “I can’t wait” means I am looking forward to. I am hoping this time will come  soon.

Daniel says, “It won’t be for a while,” meaning it will take some time. It won’t happen right away. He explains, “Background checks have to be done first.” A “background (background) check” is an investigation  of someone’s past, of what they have done in the past, especially making sure this person hasn’t committed any crimes, hasn’t been arrested by the police, or hasn’t done anything that would make the company not want to hire that person  or make that person an employee. Vanessa says, “Background checks? Are tho se really necessary?”

Daniel responds, “You’d be surprised,” meaning “Yes , you would be surprised,” or “It would surprise you to know how necessary the y are.” He explains, “We’ve been burned before.” “To be burned” (burned) here m eans to have a bad experience, especially because you’ve trusted someo ne. If you trust someone to help you, or if you trust someone with some money –  you give someone some

money thinking that person is going to give it back  to you – and then that person leaves with your money, we would say you were “burn ed.” You trusted a person and that person did not do what he said he would do .

Daniel says, “We don’t want to hire anyone with pri or instances of negligence” (negligence). “Negligence” is not taking care of so mething the way you are supposed to. “Negligence” is when you don’t want to  do something wrong, but you’re not very careful, and because you’re not car eful, something bad happens. Daniel talks about not wanting to hire anyone with “prior (prior) instances of negligence.” “Prior instances” just means things th at happened in the past. The word “prior” means before now, or in the past. “Ins tances” just mean specific cases or times when certain things happened.

Daniel says they also don’t want to hire anyone “wh o’s been involved in a corporate scandal.” “Corporate” (corporate) refers to a corporation, or a large company. A “scandal” (scandal) is when someone does  something wrong and it becomes public, and then people start talking about  it, giving the company perhaps a bad reputation. Daniel’s company doesn’t want to hire anyone who has been involved in a “corporate scandal.”

“Sometimes,” he continues, “we even get people with  fraudulent credentials.” “Fraudulent” (fraudulent) means false, or not real.  “Credentials” (credentials) are things that show or demonstrate that you are qualif ied to do something. Credentials might include a certificate that shows you know how to do a certain job, or a degree from a university, or some other p roof that you are capable of doing what you say you are able to do.

Vanessa asks, “Isn’t a background check kind of,” o r somewhat, “invasive (invasive)?” “Invasive” means finding out informati on about someone that you don’t really need to know or you shouldn’t know. “I nvasive” is sometimes defined as violating someone’s “privacy” (privacy). “Privac y” refers to things that are yours, that belong to you, or that are about you th at no one else has a right to know.

Vanessa says, “What do they check for? A criminal r ecord?” A “criminal record” is proof that you have been arrested by the police – that you have broken the law and that you have been found guilty. In other words , the judge or the court said “Yes, you committed,” or did, “this crime.” Daniel says, “Yes” – they check for a criminal record – “but that’s just the beginning. I nvestigators,” people who look at someone’s background, “check,” or look at, “driving  records, credit reports, school transcripts, sex offender lists, and much mo re.”

A background check, at least in some places in the United States or by some companies, could involve looking at things such as your “driving record.” This would be a report of whether you have ever speeded or have ever broken any traffic laws and been punished for it. It might als o involve “credit reports.” A “credit report” shows how much money you have borro wed, or whether you pay your credit cards on time, whether you have had any  bankruptcies – that is, if you’ve been unable to pay your bills in the past.

A background check might also include “school trans cripts.” A “transcript” (transcript) is a record of all the classes or cour ses you took in school and what grade you got in those classes. A “sex offender (of fender) list” is a list of people living in a particular area who have been arrested and found guilty in the past of some sex crimes, such as rape or having sex with so meone who is not legally of age. In many places in the U.S., the government kee ps a list of where sex offenders live, and they are required after they ge t out of jail to tell the government where they are living and people can loo k at these lists and see if those people are living near you.

I should mention that all of these things, such as driving records, credit reports, school transcripts (but not sex offender lists) wou ld require your permission. So, if you were going to work for a company, you would give the company permission. You would say, “Yes, I say it’s okay for you to look at all of these different records.” Typically, the companies can’t look at these things unless they ask you first and you say yes. Sex offender lists a re different. Those are public information.

Vanessa said she had no idea, meaning she didn’t re alize this is what a background check could involve. Daniel continues, “ When someone runs your Social Security number, all sorts of things come up . Investigators also check court records and medical records.”

Your “Social Security number” is a nine-digit numbe r, or nine numbers, assigned or given to each citizen of the United States that is used to identify you. Technically it’s supposed to be so that you can get  benefits when you are old and retire or need help from the government, but in fac t it’s a number that every U.S. citizen and even some non-citizens are given to ide ntify them, and you are asked for that number by the government or by companies i n order to identify you.

Daniel refers to “running” someone’s Social Securit y number. “To run” here means simply to put that number into a computer to get information about a person. When you do that, according to Daniel, “all  kinds of things come up.” In

other words, you can learn a lot about a person dep ending on which database or which source of information you use.

He says, “Investigators can also check court record s and medical records.” “Court records” are reports about what an individua l has done in terms of the law – if a person has been arrested, or if a person has  tried to sue another person to get money from another person because the other per son hasn’t paid him, and so forth – anything involving the government and the court system, judges, and so forth. Most of that information is public inform ation, except when it involves children who are not yet of legal age – who are les s than 18 years old.

“Medical records” refer, of course, to what your do ctor knows about you – things that happen in a hospital and so forth. Medical rec ords are private, again, unless typically you give permission for someone to look a t them. Vanessa says, “That’s amazing.” She’s surprised at all of the things thes e background checks can learn about you. Daniel says, “On top of all that,” meaning in addit ion, “they often speak with past employers and character references.” “They” here re fers to the investigators.

They may talk to the people you used to work for as  well as some friends and family who would be character references. A “charac ter (character) reference (reference)” is someone who has known you for a lon g time and can say if you are a good person morally or ethically, for example . For certain government jobs that involve security, you may have family members or friends who are interviewed by the government to make sure you’re n ot a spy, or that you are trustworthy and reliable.

Vanessa says, “And the new hires are okay with the company doing this kind of invasive background check?” She’s asking if the peo ple who are going to be hired by the company, who are going to be employees , are okay with the company doing all of these checks. Daniel says, “Yo u were.” Vanessa is surprised. She’s surprised to learn that the compan y ran a background check on her. She says, “You mean they ran a background chec k on me before I was hired?”

Daniel says, “You bet.” “You bet” is an informal wa y of saying yes, absolutely, that is correct. Vanessa says, “So they know all ab out . . .” She’s about to tell us perhaps something secret. And Daniel says, “What?” He wants to know what Vanessa is going to tell him, and she says, “Forget  it,” meaning don’t worry about it, or I don’t want to tell you anymore. Obviously,  she has perhaps some secret that the background check didn’t find.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: I can’t wait until the new employees start  work. We need the help.

Daniel: It won’t be for a while. Background checks have to be done first.

Vanessa: Background checks? Are those really necess ary?

Daniel: You’d be surprised. We’ve been burned befor e. We don’t want to hire anyone with prior instances of negligence or anyone  else who has been involved in a corporate scandal. Sometimes we even get peopl e with fraudulent credentials.

# Problems with the Heating System

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,269 – Problems with the Heating System.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,269. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Dan and Janice a bout problems with a heating system – the thing that keeps your house wa rm. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

[Doorbell rings]

Dan: Hello, I’m Dan. I’m here to fix your heating s ystem.

Janice: Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’ t expect a repairperson to come out the same day.

Dan: I just finished another repair in the neighbor hood and the company told me to come by. How long has it been on the fritz?

Janice: Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for two mont hs. We used it to heat the basement.

Dan: But you just called for repairs today.

Janice: I didn’t call about the boiler. I called ab out our radiators. The radiators heat the original part of the house. But we’re also  having problems with the furnace for our central heating system, which heats  the extension.

Dan: You mean you have two different heating system s in one house?

Janice: It’s an old house. Each system was installe d at a different time.

Dan: So you could have problems with more than one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.

 Janice: I know that we should install one system for the whole house, but that would be expensive.

Dan: More expensive than fixing two separate system s?

Janice: Is this going to cost a lot?

Dan: I’m afraid so.

Janice: Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs. I guess we’ll have to use these.

Dan: What are those?

Janice: Space heaters.

[end of dialogue]

Dan rings the doorbell, which we hear at the beginn ing of the dialogue. A “doorbell” is something that makes noise to indicat e that someone is at your door and wants you to open it. Dan says, “Hello, I’m Dan . I’m here to fix your heating system.” Dan is talking to Janice, who has, of cour se, opened the door. A “heating system” refers to all of the equipment and  technology used to control the temperature in your house or in a building.

We sometimes talk about a “heating and cooling syst em.” In some places, it gets very hot, and so you want what is called “air condi tioning,” which puts cool air into your house. If it’s cold, you want heating so that your house is warm. My house just has a heating system. I don’t have a coo ling system. My cooling system is opening the windows.

In our dialogue, Dan is there to fix the heating sy stem. Janice says, “Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’t expect a repairpe rson to come out the same day.” A “service call” is when someone comes to your hous e to fix something that is wrong. It could be your plumbing, it could be your electricity, or in this case, your heating system.

Janice “didn’t expect a repairperson.” A “repairper son” (or a “repairman” or “repairwoman”) is a person who fixes something brok en in your house or perhaps in another building. Usually if you have an electri cal or mechanical device in your house that doesn’t work, such as a washer or a refr igerator, you can call a

repairperson to come and fix it. That person will “ come out,” meaning they will go to your house.

Dan says, “I just finished another repair” – that i s, I just fixed someone else’s machine in the same neighborhood, “and the company told me to come by.” “To come by” means to go to someone’s, in this case, ho use. Dan says, “How long has it been on the fritz?” The expression “on the f ritz” (fritz) means not working correctly, or working in a way that you don’t like or that is not acceptable to you. If your television is “on the fritz,” it isn’t working , or at least it isn’t working the way you want it to work.

Janice says, “Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for tw o months.” A “boiler” (boiler) is something that some homes and buildings have in ord er to provide heat. A “boiler” actually heats up water. The water turns i nto vapor or steam, and that vapor or steam is sent through certain pipes or tub es that go into the house or the building that warm the surrounding air. These p ipes or tubes usually are in each room. They are put together and called a “radi ator” (radiator). My house back in Minnesota, where I grew up, had a boiler an d radiators. It’s an older system of heating houses and buildings. The school I went to also had a very large boiler and radiators in each classroom.

Janice says the boiler in her house “hasn’t worked for two months.” She says, “We used it to heat the basement.” A “basement” (ba sement) is a level or floor of a building that is below the ground. In many parts of the United States, such as in the Midwest and in the east, the houses often have basements a level below the ground. Here in California, most houses do not have  basements.

Dan is a little confused because Janice says the bo iler hasn’t worked for two months. He says, “But you just called for repairs t oday.” Janice clarifies. She says, “I didn’t call about the boiler. I called abo ut our radiators.” I explained what radiators are, of course. “Radiators heat the original part of the house.” So  it looks like, or sounds like, Janice has an old part of a house and a new part of  her house.

She says, “We’re also having problems with the furn ace for our central heating system, which heats the extension.” Another way of heating your house, more common nowadays, is through what is called a “furna ce” (furnace). A furnace is a large piece of equipment that burns wood, natural g as, or oil to heat up the air that is used to heat the home.

A boiler heats water, which then becomes steam that  is sent through these pipes into the radiators which heat the air around it. A “furnace” heats the air itself and

then takes that air and moves it throughout the hou se so that the air is warm in different parts of the house. Technically, then, th ey are different ways of heating a house, although when I was growing up, we often r eferred to the boiler as the furnace without distinguishing between the two, but  there is a difference.

Janice says that the new part of her house – the ex tension – is heated with a furnace. An “extension” (extension) is a part of a house that is added after the original house is built. Here in Los Angeles, it’s very common for houses to have extensions in the back because people want more roo m. Janice mentions that they have a central heating system in the new part of their house.

A “central heating system” refers to a set of equip ment that sends heat throughout the entire house. Most houses have a cen tral heating system, at least most large houses where a furnace is used to heat u p the air which is then sent throughout the house to heat it up. There are some older houses that don’t have a central heating system. They have a little heatin g system in every room.

I used to live in a small house that had one heater  in the middle of the house, and that was supposed to heat all of the rooms of t he house. So you had to keep the doors open in order to have the heat go into the different rooms. That wasn’t really a central heating system. Central heating sy stems usually move the air through the house using fans that blow the air from  one part of the house to the other.

In any case, Janice is having problems with the fur nace in their central heating system. She says they’re having problems not only w ith the radiators that are part of the boiler system, but also with the furnac e for the extension. Dan says, “You mean you have two different heating systems in  one house?”

Janice explains, “It’s an old house. Each system wa s installed at a different time.” “To install” (install) means to connect a new piece  of equipment or to put in a new piece of equipment. We often use this verb “to inst all” when we’re talking about a piece of equipment, mechanical or electrical, that is connected to something else and becomes a more or less permanent part of a hous e or a building. So we might talk about “installing” a security camera or a set of cameras in different parts of your house. Here we’re talking about insta lling heating systems.

Dan says, “So you could have problems with more tha n one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.” Dan is listing, conveniently, different parts of a heating system. A “thermostat” (thermostat) is a sm all device that you use to set the temperature that you want in your house. It’s h ow you turn the heater on and off, or turn the air conditioner on and off. A ther mostat has a thermometer which

tells you what the temperature is inside of a room,  and you can change it, turning the heater on or off depending on whether you want more or less heat.

A “heating element” is something that becomes hot t hrough the use of electricity, and that electricity creates heat. Heating elements  are actually not used typically in either a boiler or a furnace system. A heating e lement would be used in an electric heater. Some people have, in addition to a  heating system in their houses, electric heaters that they put in individua l rooms when they want just one room to be warmer than another. Those electrical he aters have heating elements that get hot because the electricity is going throu gh them, and that creates hot air around the heating element.

A “fan” (fan) is something that moves air. A furnac e system has hot air which is then moved by fans to different parts of the house from the furnace to the rooms where you need the heat. An electric heater also us es typically a fan, although not all do. Finally, we have the word “ductwork” (d uctwork). “Ductwork” refers to the tubes or passages that go from the furnace to t he individual rooms of the house through which the hot air goes.

So, if you walk into a house and you see, usually o n the ceiling, an opening that has metal bars over it, that’s probably connected t o a duct. Those “ducts” are basically big tubes that are connected to the furna ce. The furnace sends the hot air through those ducts into the individual rooms. If you see, on the other hand, metal radiators, either by the floor or against the  wall, that house has a boiler system.

Janice says, “I know that we should install one sys tem for the whole house, but that would be expensive.” Dan says, “More expensive  than fixing two separate systems?” Janice doesn’t really answer the question . Instead, she asks another question, “Is this going to cost a lot?” meaning is  what Dan is going to do today to fix these two systems going to cost a lot of money?

Dan says, “I’m afraid so.” “I’m afraid so” is anoth er way of saying, believe it or not, yes. “I’m afraid so” means “Yes, I am sorry to  say that this is true.” Janice says, “Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs.” “E xpensive” means costing a lot of money. “I guess we’ll have to use these.” Dan sa ys, “What are those?”

Janice says, “Space heaters.” Space heaters are wha t I was describing previously. These are little machines that have hea ting elements in them, that you plug into the wall so that the electricity heat s up the heating elements and you can heat up a small area or a small room. If yo u have lots of space heaters, I

 suppose you could heat up a big room. We used to us e space heaters all the time in my old house where we didn’t have a central  heating system.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

[Doorbell rings]

Dan: Hello, I’m Dan. I’m here to fix your heating s ystem.

Janice: Oh, when I put in the service call, I didn’ t expect a repairperson to come out the same day.

Dan: I just finished another repair in the neighbor hood and the company told me to come by. How long has it been on the fritz?

Janice: Well, the boiler hasn’t worked for two mont hs. We used it to heat the basement.

Dan: But you just called for repairs today.

Janice: I didn’t call about the boiler. I called ab out our radiators. The radiators heat the original part of the house. But we’re also  having problems with the furnace for our central heating system, which heats  the extension.

Dan: You mean you have two different heating system s in one house?

Janice: It’s an old house. Each system was installe d at a different time.

Dan: So you could have problems with more than one thermostat, heating element, fan, or set of ductwork.

Janice: I know that we should install one system for the whole house, but that would be expensive.

Dan: More expensive than fixing two separate system s?

Janice: Is this going to cost a lot?

Dan: I’m afraid so.

 Janice: Well, we can’t afford expensive repairs. I guess we’ll have to use these.

Dan: What are those?

Janice: Space heaters.

# Cold and Frozen Treats

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,270 – Cold and Frozen Treats.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,270. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This dialogue is between Miranda and Luca about eat ing things that are cold and sweet. Sounds good to me. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Miranda: Mmm, I could really go for an ice cream su ndae right now.

Luca: I was thinking more like a cup of hot cocoa.

Miranda: Forget that. A banana split with ice cream  and lots of chocolate sauce topped with whipped cream – mmm.

Luca: I like chocolate, too, but hot chocolate soun ds much better.

Miranda: Oh, maybe we could run to the store for so me popsicles and ice cream sandwiches. Those would really hit the spot.

Luca: Some mulled cider is more like it for me.

Miranda: If only we had a snow cone machine. We cou ld make our own snow cones!

Luca: How about a hot toddy instead?

Miranda: No way! Do you think the frozen yogurt sto re is still open at this hour?

Luca: You do know that it’s the middle of winter, r ight?

Miranda: I know, but I can’t help it. I need to coo l off.

 Luca: Hot flashes again?

Miranda: That’s right. I wonder if the pool is froz en.

[end of dialogue]

Miranda begins our dialogue by going, “Mmm.” That s ound “mmm” is one we make when something either smells good or tastes go od. Miranda says, “I could really go for an ice cream sundae right now.” Miran da isn’t smelling or tasting anything right now. She’s thinking about it.

She says she “could go for an ice cream sundae.” the expression “to go for” something here means to be excited about the idea of doing something or eating something. When someone says, “I could go for a ham burger,” he means “I really feel like eating a hamburger.” I would like a hambu rger right now. The expression is really “I could go for.” “He could go for.” The word “could” is important here. That indicates that it’s something you want to eat,  or something you want to do.

Miranda “could go for an ice cream sundae” (sundae) . Notice the spelling of the word “sundae.” That word is pronounced the same as the first day of the week, “Sunday” (Sunday), but it’s spelled different. A “s undae” is a kind of dessert, a sweet thing you eat after the main meal, that is ma de from one or more types of ice cream. A sundae usually has something else with  it in addition to the ice cream, such as nuts, fruit, or some kind of candy o n top. An “ice cream sundae” might have a liquid form of sugar called “syrup,” o r at least syrup made with sugar. “Syrup” is a liquid that you pour over somet hing else. It’s usually sweet.

Luca says, “I was thinking more like a cup of hot c ocoa.” Luca is thinking of eating something different, or actually drinking so mething, such as a “cup of hot cocoa” (cocoa). “Cocoa” here refers to a powdered c hocolate, a form of chocolate that you use for cooking – or in this cas e, for making a chocolate drink usually combined with hot water or perhaps hot milk . Miranda says, “Forget that,” meaning no, that’s not a good idea. She continues, “A banana split with ice cream and lots of chocolate sauce topped with whipp ed cream – mmm.” Notice again she makes that sound, “mmm,” which indicates something that would taste good.

Miranda now has the idea of eating another kind of dessert called a “banana split.” I used to love eating banana splits when I was a child. A banana split is made by taking a banana and cutting it in half the long way, and putting those in a dish, and then you take three, what we would call  “scoops” (scoops) of ice

cream – a “scoop” of ice cream is like a little bal l of ice cream – and you take one scoop of vanilla-flavored, one scoop of chocolate-f lavored, and one scoop of strawberry-flavored ice cream and you put them in t he dish in between the two pieces of banana.

Then, you usually put some chocolate sauce, which i s a liquid you pour over the ice cream, as well as some whipped cream. “Cream” i s a form of milk, or something that you would get from milk that’s very fatty. You whip it – you add air to it, basically, so that it’s very light, and you put it on top of the banana split.

Luca says, “I like chocolate, too, but hot chocolat e sounds much better.” “Hot chocolate” is a sweet drink made by melting chocolate into hot  milk and then mixing it with sugar and vanilla. “Hot cocoa” and “hot chocolate” are basically the same thing. “Cocoa” is made usually from powdered chocolate – c hocolate that is dried and put into very small pieces. “Hot chocolate” is ofte n made directly from, say, a bar of chocolate. Luca wants some hot chocolate.

Miranda says, “Oh, maybe we could run to the store, ” meaning go to the store, “for some popsicles and ice cream sandwiches. Those  would really hit the spot,” she says. A “popsicle” (popsicle) is made by taking  juice or some combination of juice and water and freezing it onto a little stick , and then you take the popsicle after it is frozen and you can lick the frozen juic e, or juice and water combination. A popsicle is usually about, oh, I don’t know, six,  maybe five, six inches long and about maybe an inch around.

An “ice cream sandwich” is a dessert made by taking  a piece of ice cream, basically, or some ice cream and putting it in betw een two frozen chocolate cookies or two frozen pieces of chocolate almost li ke a chocolate cake. It’s not exactly like a cookie. It’s more soft than a cookie . Popsicles and ice cream sandwiches are the sorts of desserts that children often like because they’re very sweet. I don’t think I’ve had a popsicle or an ice cream sandwich in many, many years.

Miranda thinks that those two things, however, “wou ld really hit the spot” (spot). The expression “to hit the spot” means to be very s atisfying when you are hungry. If you are very hungry and then you have a good meal, you might say at the end, “That really hit the spot.” It made you fu ll so that you’re no longer hungry anymore, and usually it tasted good.

Luca is not thinking of cold drinks. He’s still thi nking of something hot. He says, “Some mulled cider is more like it for me.” The phr ase “is more like it for me”

means “is something that I would want more.” Luca wants some “mulled (mulled) cider (cider).” “Cider” is made from fruit. It’s the juice of a fruit. “Mulled cider” is apple juice that is heated and has cinnamon, nutmeg , clove, and other spices in it.

Miranda says, “If only we had a snow cone machine.”  A “snow cone” (cone) is a paper cup that has small pieces of flavored ice, us ually ice that is chopped up in very small pieces and then has colored, sweetened l iquid poured over it, a kind of sugar that is poured over it. You’ll sometimes s ee snow cones sold at outdoor events during the summertime. Miranda thinks that t hey could make their own snow cones, but Luca wants instead a “hot toddy” (t oddy).

A “hot toddy” is a hot drink made with some kind of  alcohol, such as rum or whiskey, added to hot water, honey or sugar, and pe rhaps some other kind of flavoring. Miranda says, “No way! Do you think the frozen yogurt store is still open at this hour?” “Frozen yogurt” (yogurt) is a d essert similar to ice cream, but it’s made with yogurt instead. Luca says, “You do k now that it’s the middle of winter, right?” “The middle of winter” means that it is in one of the cold months, such as January, February, or March.

Miranda says, “I know, but I can’t help it. I need to cool off.” Miranda is hot for some reason, and therefore she needs “to cool off.”  She needs to lower her body temperature. Luca asks, “Hot flashes again?” A “hot  flash” (flash) is when you suddenly feel very hot even though the temperature in the room or outside has not changed. “Hot flashes” are something that happe ns sometimes to women who, when they get older, go through something call ed “menopause” (menopause). It’s a certain time of a woman’s life when her body’s hormones begin to change. I won’t explain it all here.

Miranda says, “That’s right,” meaning yes, she is h aving hot flashes. Then she says, “I wonder if the pool is frozen.” A “pool” (p ool) here refers to a swimming pool, an area that is full of water that you can sw im in. Miranda is asking if the swimming pool is “frozen” (frozen). “Frozen” is whe n water becomes a solid. If the pool is “frozen,” the water inside of the pool has frozen and therefore you cannot swim in it. Miranda is so hot, she’s thinkin g of swimming even when it is very cold outside.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Miranda: Mmm, I could really go for an ice cream su ndae right now.

 Luca: I was thinking more like a cup of hot cocoa.

Miranda: Forget that. A banana split with ice cream  and lots of chocolate sauce topped with whipped cream – mmm.

Luca: I like chocolate, too, but hot chocolate soun ds much better.

# Disapproving of a Remarriage

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,271 – Disapproving of a Remarriage.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,271. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and become a member of ESL Podcast . When you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Ellie and Lauren t about disapproving or not liking someone marrying a second time – “remarrying ,” we would say. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ellie: I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone  with my mother and she dropped a bombshell.

Laurent: What did she tell you?

Ellie: She’s thinking of remarrying.

Laurent: Are your parents divorced?

Ellie: No, my mother is a widow. My father passed a way eight years ago.

Laurent: Oh, I’m sorry. You don’t approve of your p rospective stepfather?

Ellie: Uh, don’t use that term. I don’t like or dis like him. It’s just that my mother should not be remarrying – period. She should stay true to my father’s memory.

Laurent: After eight years?

Ellie: Theirs was a picture-perfect marriage. How c ould she forget about it and take up with this other guy?

Laurent: Don’t you want your mother to move on and be happy?

Ellie: By replacing my father with this new guy?

 Laurent: I’m sure she’s not trying to replace him. She just wants a new love in her life.

Ellie: My father was the love of her life. This oth er guy is a pale substitute.

Laurent: Can’t you just be happy for her?

Ellie: I’m never betraying my father’s memory.

Laurent: Does that mean you’ll never marry?

Ellie: Well, no, I can stay true to my father’s mem ory and still get married.

Laurent: So can your mother!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about someone getting married again . It could be for the second time. It could be for the third, fourth, fifth, six th, or seventh time, but I think we’re just talking about the second time here. Ellie begi ns by saying to Laurent, “I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone with my mother ,” meaning I just was talking on the telephone to my mother, “and she dropped a bomb shell.” The expression “to drop (drop) a bombshell (bombshell)” means to make a very surprising, shocking announcement – to tell someone some news that is us ually bad news and very surprising news.

Ellie says her mother “dropped a bombshell,” meanin g told her some very surprising news. Laurent says, “What did she tell y ou?” Ellie responds, “She’s thinking of remarrying.” “To remarry” (remarry) mea ns to marry again, either after you have had a divorce – meaning you’ve ended a pre vious marriage with your husband or wife – or after your husband or wife has  died.

Laurent says, “Are your parents divorced?” “To be d ivorced” (divorced) means to marry and then to end your marriage legally – to go  to the government and say, “I am no longer married to this woman” or “I’m no long er married to this man.” Well, of course, you both have to declare that you’re not  married, although in many states in the U.S., probably in most states, even i f you don’t want to be divorced you can have your marriage ended by your husband or  wife.

Ellie says her mother is not divorced. Her mother i s a “widow” (widow). A “widow” is a woman whose husband has died. The term for a m an would be a “widower”

(widower). A “widower” is a man whose wife has died . There are many more widows in the world than widowers because women ten d to live longer than men. Men are probably more likely to marry a woman young er than them than a woman is to marry a man. I’m not sure what the stat istics are on that. That’s just my impression – what I think is true.

In any case, Ellie’s mother is a widow. She says he r father “passed away eight years ago.” The expression “to pass (pass) away” me ans simply to die, but it’s a nicer way of saying “to die.” You may ask a friend of yours, “When did your father pass away?” That sounds better than saying, “When d id your father die?” It depends on the situation, but “to pass away” is usu ally considered a more polite way of saying “die.”

Laurent says, “Oh, I’m sorry.” Once again, it might  be the case that if you didn’t know that someone’s friend – or in this case, paren t – has died and the person tells you, you might say, “Oh, I’m sorry,” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” “You don’t approve of your prospective stepfather?” Laurent sa ys. “To approve” means to think something is good or acceptable. “I approve of him” means I think he’s a good person, or I think he’s acceptable for whateve r the situation is. Laurent is asking Ellie if she approves of her “prospective (p rospective) stepfather (stepfather).” “Prospective” means “potential,” som ething that might happen in the future.

The term “stepfather” is used to refer to a man who  marries a woman who already has children. The man will legally make him self the father of those children. In that case, we would call that man thei r – or the children’s – “stepfather.”

Ellie says, “Uh, don’t use that term.” The “term” i s a word – in this case, the word “stepfather.” She then says, “I don’t like or disli ke him. It’s just that my mother should not be remarrying – period.” Ellie doesn’t h ate the new boyfriend of her mother. However, she does not think her mother shou ld “be remarrying – period” (period).

The word “period” here is used to mean “at all.” It ’s a word that we use for emphasis. A “period,” of course, is a small little round dot that goes at the end of a printed sentence in a book or in a document. It i ndicates the end of something, but when someone says it in a sentence like this, h e means to use that word as emphasis to say “at all” or “completely.” In Englan d, in British English, they call a period a “full stop,” and they use that term “full stop” the same way we use the word “period” in English.

Ellie says that her mother “should stay true” to he r father’s memory. “To stay true to” something means to remain loyal and faithful to  something, to remember something in such a way that you don’t deny it or r eject it. “Stay true to your wife” – that means don’t go out and try to find a new wom an. You must stay loyal to her. You must be faithful to her. You must only be with her and love her. That would be “staying true to” a person, in this case.

Ellie thinks that her mother should stay true not t o her father, since her father is dead now, but to her father’s “memory” (memory). “M emory” is how you remember someone – the idea about how someone was i n your mind. Laurent says, “After eight years?” He thinks that Ellie is asking too much of her mother to not get married just because the mother loved her f ather. Ellie says, “Theirs,” meaning their marriage – her mother’s and father’s – “was a picture-perfect marriage.” “Picture-perfect” is a term that means “ ideal,” one that was without any problems.

“How could she forget about it and take up with thi s other guy?” Ellie says. Ellie is saying here that she is surprised her mother would get married again, because to her that means that she has forgotten about her fat her. She uses the term “take up with” to describe her mother getting involved in  this new romantic relationship. However, we often use that expression “to take up w ith” in a negative way, when we don’t approve of or agree with someone starting a romantic relationship with another person.

Laurent says, “Don’t you want your mother to move o n and be happy?” The phrasal verb “to move on” means to end one thing an d begin a new thing. It is especially used when we’re talking about romantic r elationships. You end one relationship and then you forget about that one and  find a new romantic relationship. That’s called “moving on.” We also us e that phrasal verb to mean simply to continue on to something new, to stop tal king about or worrying about what has happened in the past, or with one particul ar issue. We move on – we continue on to a new thing.

Ellie says, “By replacing my father with this new g uy?” She thinks her mother is moving on by replacing the memory of her father. “T o replace” (replace) means to start using one thing instead of another thing. Laurent says, “I’m sure she’s not trying to replace him.” Laurent is telling Ellie th at he doesn’t think her mother is trying to replace her father. He says, “She just wa nts a new love in her life.” Ellie says, “My father was the love of her life.”

The “love of your life” is the person you think you  are meant to be with, the one and only person with whom you should be or toward w hom you could have a

deep kind of love. Ellie says, “This other guy,” me aning her mother’s new boyfriend, “is a pale substitute.” A “substitute” ( substitute) is a replacement for something, when you use one thing instead of someth ing else. “Pale” (pale) here means something that is inferior or worse than the original. So, a “pale substitute” would be something or someone that is not nearly as  good as the thing or person replaced.

Laurent says, “Can’t you just be happy for her?” El lie says, “I’m not betraying my father’s memory.” “To betray” (betray) someone or s omething means not to be true to or loyal to that person. If someone tells y ou a secret and then you say, “Okay, I won’t tell anyone else,” and you, the next  day, go and tell five other people, you have betrayed your friend. You have bet rayed the person who gave you that secret or told you that secret. You were n ot loyal or faithful to that person. Someone who sells secret information to ano ther government betrays his country – is not faithful to his country.

Ellie does not want to betray her father’s memory. Laurent says, “Does that mean you’ll never marry?” Ellie says, “Well, no, I can s tay true to my father’s memory and still get married.” Laurent says, “So can your mother!” meaning your mother can also get married and stay true to her father’s memory.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ellie: I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone  with my mother and she dropped a bombshell.

Laurent: What did she tell you?

Ellie: She’s thinking of remarrying.

Laurent: Are your parents divorced?

Ellie: No, my mother is a widow. My father passed a way eight years ago.

# Returning and Exchanging Merchandise

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,272 – Returning and Exchanging Merchandise.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,272. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast, and when you do, you can download the Learning Guide for thi s episode. The Learning Guide contains all of the words that we speak – tha t is to say, a complete transcript of everything we say.

This episode is a dialogue between Spencer and a wo man who works at the store about returning things to the store that were  bought there. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk: Hello, how can I help you?

Spencer: I’d like to return a few things I received  over the holidays.

Clerk: Okay, do you have gift receipts?

Spencer: I do for this item. It’s unopened and unus ed.

Clerk: Let me see. I can give you a refund, but the re will be a small restocking fee.

Spencer: Really?

Clerk: I’m afraid so.

Spencer: Okay, that’s fine. I also received this on e as a gift, but don’t have a receipt.

Clerk: Let me look up that merchandise in our syste m. It looks like it was a clearance item and it was a final sale.

Spencer: But it’s unworn.

Clerk: I understand that. The best I can do is to a llow you to exchange it if it doesn’t fit or give you store credit.

Spencer: I’ll take the store credit. What about thi s?

Clerk: Let me see. That item was purchased on our o nline store and it can’t be returned to a store location, only through our webs ite.

Spencer: And this? It doesn’t work.

Clerk: I’m sorry, but that was also a clearance ite m and was sold in as-is condition.

Spencer: [sigh] All right.

Clerk: Can I help you with anything else?

Spencer: Only if you can visit the other three stor es to return the rest of my gifts.

Clerk: You didn’t get you wanted for the holidays, huh?

Spencer: My family and friends have great senses of  humor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with a “clerk” (clerk) saying s omething to Spencer. A clerk is a person who works usually at a store who helps you  buy things there, who takes your money. This clerk begins by saying to Spencer,  “Hello, how can I help you?” “How can I help you?” is a normal way that someone such as a clerk would ask what you need when you come into a store.

Spencer says, “I’d like to return a few things I re ceived over the holidays.” “To return something to a store” is to bring it back ei ther to get money or to get something else, maybe the same item. If you bought a shirt and it was too small, you might return it to the store to get a bigger shirt, or you might simply return it to get your money back – that is, they would give y ou the money that you paid for it back.

Now, in the case of Spencer, he didn’t actually buy  these things from the store. He received them over the holidays. “The holidays” refers, in the United States, to the Christian holiday of Christmas and the Jewis h holiday of Hanukkah during

which people often give gifts. The clerk says, “Oka y, do you have gift receipts?” A “receipt” (receipt) is a piece of paper showing w here something was bought and how much was paid for it. Stores usually give y ou a receipt when you buy things from them.

A “gift receipt” is when you buy a gift for another  person, but include a piece of paper from the store, a receipt, in case the person  wants to bring the gift back. Yes, in the United States, it is not uncommon for p eople to give a gift with a receipt in case the person doesn’t like the gift. I t’s a little strange, but it has become common in the last several years. Spencer sa ys, “I do for this item,” meaning he has a gift receipt for one of the “items ” (items) or things that were bought from that store.

He says this item or thing is “unopened and unused. ” “Unopened” means not opened. In this case, it refers to something that i s in the original box or package that it was when it was first bought from the store . To say something is “unused” (unused) means it has never been used. You didn’t t ake it out and use it for an hour and then put it back in the box. Sometimes sto res will only accept returns – that is, allow you to bring something back for mone y – if it is unopened and unused. If you bought a shirt, put it on, wore it t o a party, took it off, and then brought it to the store to get your money back, wel l, that would not be an unused shirt. You “used” the shirt.

The clerk says, “Let me see,” meaning let me look a t it. She says, “I can give you a refund, but there will be a small restocking fee. ” A “refund” (refund) is money that you get back because you return something or b ecause perhaps you aren’t happy with what you bought. Now, this is a “refund, ” but it’s not going to the person who bought the item. It’s going to the perso n who received the item – in this case, Spencer.

The clerk says there will be a “small restocking (r estocking) fee (fee).” A “restocking fee” is a small amount of money that a store or company will charge you or will take away from your refund for acceptin g the item back. You don’t get 100 percent, in other words, of the money you paid.  The store is going to keep a small percentage. They call that a “restocking fee. ” “To restock” means to take something and put it back on the shelves of a store  or to put it back where it can be sold again.

This is quite common nowadays if you buy electronic  goods, such as a computer. The store will take the computer back, but it won’t  give you 100 percent of the money. It will keep some of the money as a restocki ng fee. Spencer is surprised by this. He says, “Really?” The clerk says, “I’m af raid so.” “I’m afraid so” is a

polite, formal way of saying yes, especially when y ou are telling someone something that the person doesn’t like or is not happy with. Spencer says, “Okay, that’s fine,” meaning no problem.

He continues, “I also received this one as a gift, but I don’t have a receipt.” The clerk says, “Let me look up that merchandise in our  system.” “To look up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to find something – i n this case, to find something on a computer system. The word “merchandi se” (merchandise) is a word that means things that you buy and sell. It’s a general term for anything that is sold. So, in the title of this episode we have “ Returning and Exchanging ‘Merchandise.’” Merchandise is something you buy at  a store.

The clerk looks up the merchandise – the item, the thing – that Spencer wants to return and says that “It looks like,” meaning it ap pears, this thing “was a clearance item and it was a final sale.” A “clearan ce (clearance) item” is something that a store sells usually at a very low price because it is getting rid of that particular kind of thing. It is no longer goin g to be selling that particular item. In order to get rid of them, it has a “clearance sa le.”

The clerk says that this item was “bought as a fina l sale.” A “final sale” means you can’t bring it back. If you go into a store and  you see a sign that says “All sales are final” (final), that means that when you buy something, you do not have the option of bringing it back. If you buy it, you can’t return it.

Spencer complains that it’s “unworn” (unworn). We’v e had several words in this dialogue with the prefix “un” (un). “Un” is usually  used to mean “not.” So, “unused” is not used. “Unopened” is not opened. “Un worn” is not worn. “Worn” means that you have used a particular piece of clot hing. We use the verb “to wear” (wear) to refer to putting clothes on your bo dy. “I am wearing a shirt.” “I am wearing pants.” If an item is “unworn,” that means you’ve never put it on your body – a piece of clothing that has never been worn .

The clerk says, “I understand that,” meaning I unde rstand that this piece of clothing has never been worn. She says, “The best I  can do,” meaning the best possible deal I can give you, “is to allow you to e xchange it if it doesn’t fit you or give you store credit.” “To exchange” (exchange) me ans to bring something into a store that you bought there and get something ver y similar to that item. I gave the example before of buying a shirt that is too sm all for you. You go to the store and you exchange that shirt for a bigger shirt that  fits you – that is, that is the right size for you.

The clerk says that Spencer can exchange this piece  of clothing, or she can give him “store credit” (credit). “Store credit” is usua lly a piece of paper or some other way that the store gives you money that you can spe nd in the store for something else. So you buy something for $10. You don’t like it. You bring it back to the store. The store doesn’t give you $10. It says, “We ll you can buy something else in our store for $10.” That’s “store credit.”

Spencer says, “I’ll take the store credit.” Then he  says, “What about this?” showing her something else. The clerk says, “Let me  see. That item was purchased on our online store and it can’t be retur ned to a store location, only through our website.” An “online (online) store” is  a website where you can buy something on the internet. Many stores have online stores as well as physical stores – stores you can drive your car to and walk into. Some stores don’t allow you to buy things online and then return it to one of their physical stores, and that’s what the clerk is telling Spencer.

Spencer then shows the clerk something else. He say s, “And this? It doesn’t work” (work). “To work” here means to function prop erly. If something “doesn’t work,” it’s broken. It doesn’t do what it’s suppose d to do. A television that you can’t watch because there’s no picture is a broken television. It doesn’t work. The clerk says, “I’m sorry, but that was also a clearan ce item and was sold in as-is condition.”

If something is sold in “as (as) – is (is) conditio n,” that means once you buy it, you can’t return it, even if it is broken. Usually something is sold in “as-is“ condition when it’s already broken or when there’s already a problem with it. You can’t buy it and then say, “Oh, it’s broken. I want  to bring it back.” You bought it in “as-is condition.” You knew that it wasn’t perfect when you bought it, and you can’t return it.

Spencer is not very happy. He says, “All right.” the clerk then says, “Can I help you with anything else?” Spencer says, “Only if you  can visit the three other stores to return the rest of my gifts.” Spencer is making a joke here. The clerk isn’t really asking him if she can do anything for him. So when she asks if she can help him with anything else, she doesn’t mean h elping him go to other stores and return his other gifts.

She then says, “You didn’t get what you wanted for the holidays, huh?” Spencer says, “My family and friends have great senses of h umor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?” A “sense (sense) of humor (humor) ” is the ability to find things funny, to laugh. He says his friends and fam ily “have great senses of humor,” meaning that they know how to laugh. They l ike to be funny. “But,” he

 says, “how many gag (gag) gifts can one man own?” A  “gag gift” is a gift that is intended to be or is supposed to be funny. It’s not  a nice thing. It’s supposed to make you laugh.

Spencer’s friends and family gave him a lot of gag gifts for the holidays instead of real gifts. The joke here is that, in the United St ates, there is a famous store called “Spencer’s” that sells mostly gag gifts – th ings like cups and mugs with funny sayings on them, and similar things that peop le think are supposed to be funny. Because his name is Spencer, they gave him a ll of these gag gifts because there’s a famous store that sells gag gifts  named “Spencer’s.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk: Hello, how can I help you?

Spencer: I’d like to return a few things I received  over the holidays.

Clerk: Okay, do you have gift receipts?

Spencer: I do for this item. It’s unopened and unus ed.

Clerk: Let me see. I can give you a refund, but the re will be a small restocking fee.

Spencer: Really?

Clerk: I’m afraid so.

Spencer: Okay, that’s fine. I also received this on e as a gift, but don’t have a receipt.

Clerk: Let me look up that merchandise in our syste m. It looks like it was a clearance item and it was a final sale.

Spencer: But it’s unworn.

Clerk: I understand that. The best I can do is to a llow you to exchange it if it doesn’t fit or give you store credit.

Spencer: I’ll take the store credit. What about thi s?

 Clerk: Let me see. That item was purchased on our o nline store and it can’t be returned to a store location, only through our webs ite.

Spencer: And this? It doesn’t work.

Clerk: I’m sorry, but that was also a clearance ite m and was sold in as-is condition.

Spencer: [sigh] All right.

Clerk: Can I help you with anything else?

Spencer: Only if you can visit the other three stor es to return the rest of my gifts.

Clerk: You didn’t get you wanted for the holidays, huh?

Spencer: My family and friends have great senses of  humor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?

# Improving School Security

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,273 – Improving School Security.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,273. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store that has additional courses in business, daily, and cultural  English.

This episode is a dialogue between Roberto and Ginn y about making sure our schools are safe. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, let’s get started. I organized this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.

Ginny: But we already have controlled access to sch ool buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.

Roberto: Those measures help to keep people out of our school who don’t belong here. But in light of what’s happened at oth er schools, we need to do more to keep students safe.

Ginny: You mean in the event of bomb threats and ma ss shootings?

Roberto: Those are some of the threats we have to p repare for.

Ginny: I don’t know how we can prepare for those th ings.

Roberto: Well, we might consider security cameras a nd armed guards to patrol the school.

Ginny: Really?

Roberto: Really. We need to develop evacuation plan s or procedures for lockdown in the event of an imminent threat.

Ginny: This is scary stuff.

 Roberto: We live in scary times.

Ginny: It’s starting to feel like we work in a pris on, not a school!

[end of dialogue]

Roberto begins by saying, “All right, let’s get sta rted.” Roberto is talking to a group of people and he wants to start the meeting t hat they are having. He explains, “I organized” – or “I planned” – “this fa culty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.” The word “ faculty” (faculty) refers to the teachers at a school. It could be a high school. It  could be a college. I think of the word usually being associated with colleges, but hi gh schools and other schools for children also sometimes use this word to descri be the entire group of teachers at that school.

“Staff” (staff) can refer to anyone who works at a company or in an organization. In the case of schools, “staff” could refer to the teachers, but here it refers to everyone who works at the school who is not a teach er. That would include the janitors, the people in the kitchen, the administra tors – that is, the principal and other leaders of the school –and so forth.

The meeting Roberto organized is all about “school security” (security). The word “security” can refer to a couple of different thing s. Here it refers to keeping people at the school safe. “School security” would be keep ing the faculty, staff, and students safe so that there are no injuries, and mo re importantly that no one gets killed. Sadly, in the past several decades, there h ave been several cases where people have died at schools, usually because people  outside of the school have brought guns and killed them, though sometimes it can be students in the school itself.

One of the people at the meeting, Ginny, says, “But  we already have controlled access to school buildings, and all of the staff an d faculty wear ID badges.” The term “controlled access” (access) refers to a syste m in a building where only the people who are supposed to be in certain parts of t he building are allowed to go into those parts. It’s another way of saying a syst em of locks that prevent people who are not supposed to be in certain rooms or cert ain parts of the building from getting into those places.

Nowadays, many of these locks are electronic, so th at you put a number into the lock in order to open it, or you use a special magn etic card that you either put through something called a “card reader” that allow s you to open a door or you

bring near a card reader pad (pad) that allows you to get into a certain part of a building. “Controlled access” might also involve gu ards – people who stand next to doors, allowing people in and preventing people from going in who are not supposed to be there.

Ginny says that they already have this kind of cont rolled access to the school buildings and “all of staff and faculty wear ID bad ges” (badges). “ID” stands for “identification.” A “badge” is usually a small card  or piece of plastic that has your picture and name on it. So, an “ID badge” is someth ing that you wear that tells everyone in the building who you are and that you b elong there.

Roberto says, however, “Those measures,” meaning the things that we do already, “help to keep people out of our building w ho don’t belong here,” who aren’t supposed to be there. “But in light of what’ s happened at other schools,” he says, “we need to do more to keep students safe. ” The expression “in light (light) of” means considering, or thinking about, o r because of. Roberto is saying that because of what has happened at other schools,  their school needs to do more to keep students safe.

Ginny then asks, “You mean in the event of bomb thr eats and mass shootings?” The expression “in the event (event) of” means if o r when something happens. “In the event of rain, we will not be playing the b aseball game today.” That means if it rains, we won’t be playing baseball. Ginny sa ys, “In the event of bomb (bomb) threats (threats) and mass (mass) shootings (shooti ngs).”

A “bomb threat” is when someone says that there is a bomb in a certain place, and you better leave there or you might be killed. A “bomb” is a device, a thing that blows up and can kill you or hurt you. A “bomb  threat,” then, is sometimes used to scare people to get people out of a certain  place. A “mass shooting” is when many different people are killed, several peop le are killed in a short period of time.

Roberto says, “Those are some of the threats we hav e to prepare for.” Ginny says, “I don’t know how we can prepare for those th ings.” “I don’t know how we can get ready for a bomb threat or mass shootings,”  she’s saying. Roberto says, “Well, we might consider,” meaning we should think about, “security cameras and armed guards to patrol the school.”

“Security cameras” are cameras, video cameras, that  are usually put in the corner of a room or outside of a building to film o r make a video of everything happening in that area. These are more common in ot her countries, I think, than in the U.S., especially in Great Britain. You hear a lot about something called

“CCTV,” which stands for “closed-circuit television .” These are basically security cameras that film or take videos of everything that  is happening in a room or in a certain area.

“Armed” (armed) means with a gun. A “guard” (guard)  is a person whose job it is to protect a certain group of people or an area. So , “armed guards” are guards that have guns. Armed guards typically “patrol” (pa trol). “To patrol” means to walk around a certain area or drive around a certain are a in order to protect it and keep it safe. Roberto is suggesting that perhaps the school have guards with guns that would walk around the school in order to keep the students safe.

Ginny doesn’t think this is a good idea. She says, “Really?” She’s indicating her doubt by saying that. Roberto replies, “Really,” me aning yes. “We need to develop evacuation plans or procedures for lockdown  in the event of an imminent threat.” An “evacuation” (evacuation) is when every one has to leave a certain place because it’s dangerous there. An “evacuation plan” would be a plan or a list of steps that would be taken if, in this case,  the school had to be evacuated. Notice there is a verb “to evacuate” from which we get the word “evacuation.”

A “lockdown” (lockdown) is when the doors of a buil ding are locked to stop anyone from going out or coming in. This might be n ecessary if, for example, you want to prevent any of the children from leaving the school if there is someone dangerous near the school. An “imminent (imminent) threat” is something that is about to happen very soon. Anything that is “immine nt” will be happening in the very near future, maybe in a few minutes or in a fe w hours or perhaps a few days.

Ginny says, “This is scary stuff.” Something that i s “scary” (scary) is something that makes you afraid, something that gives you fea r. Roberto says, “We live in scary times,” meaning we live in a dangerous period  of history. Ginny says, “It’s starting to feel like we work in a prison, not a sc hool.” A “prison” (prison) is a building where we keep criminals – people who have broken the law. Another word for “prison” is a “jail” (jail).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, let’s get started. I organized this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.

Ginny: But we already have controlled access to sch ool buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.

Roberto: Those measures help to keep people out of our school who don’t belong here. But in light of what’s happened at oth er schools, we need to do more to keep students safe.

# Childish Fighting and Misbehavior.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,274 – Childish Fighting and Misbehavior.

This episode is a dialogue between Mitch and Nancy about children fighting and acting badly, as children sometimes do. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Mitch: How was work today?

Nancy: Terrible. Nobody could get along and the nam e-calling started early.

Mitch: Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in so me other way?

Nancy: Several did. At one point, a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back. I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead.

Mitch: So there was yelling?

Nancy: Lots of yelling. They tried to talk over eac h other and wouldn’t take turns. After a while, I wanted to demand some quiet time, but no one would have paid me any attention.

Mitch: That sounds like a lot of posturing. At leas t it didn’t devolve into hitting and biting.

Nancy: Not yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if ther e is plenty of that next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping  meets again.

[end of dialogue]

Mitch begins our dialogue by asking Nancy, “How was  work today?” He wants to know how Nancy’s day was at work. Nancy responds, “ Terrible,” meaning very bad. “Nobody could get along and the name-calling s tarted early.” The phrasal verb “to get along” (along) means to have a friendl y relationship with another person, to be nice to each other. If you say, “I ge t along with my mother-in-law,” that means you have a friendly relationship with he r. It also means you’re probably a liar.

Nancy also says that “the name-calling started earl y.” “Name-calling” is when you try to hurt another person’s feelings by calling or  using a bad name for him. I won’t give you examples but you probably can think of lots of names or words that you call other people whom you don’t like or w hom you want to anger. Mitch asks, “Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in so me other way?” The expression “to throw (throw) a tantrum (tantrum)” m eans to lose control of your emotions or your actions – to get very angry or ups et and begin to act in ways that you shouldn’t.

Normally, we associate this expression “throwing a tantrum” with a child, a young child who gets mad and starts yelling or perhaps hi tting other people. If you say that an adult is “throwing a tantrum,” you are real ly insulting that person, saying that that person is acting like a child, because we  only expect children to throw a tantrum. “To act (act) out” is also another express ion that we usually use with children, or to describe the way children act when they are being bad – when they are, we would say, “behaving badly.”

“To behave” (behave) means to act. The title of thi s episode is “misbehavior,” which refers to people not acting the way they shou ld, or acting badly. “To act out” means to yell or start doing things that show that you are angry. It’s something that children might do when they get upse t. They might start yelling or throwing things or hitting other people. That’s wha t “to act out” means. To be honest, I don’t remember hearing this expression a lot when I was a child. Although in my family, if you misbehaved, my parent s would certainly let you know about it and it would not last very long.

Nancy says that several people threw a tantrum and acted out at her work today. She says, “At one point,” meaning at a certain time , “a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back.” The expression “to stomp” (stomp) refers to hitting your feet against the floor loudly. The phrasal verb “to stomp out” means to leave a room by loudly  hitting your feet against the floor. It’s an indication that you’re angry and you ’re leaving because you are angry or upset with someone.

Similarly, “to slam (slam) the door” means to close  the door very loudly, with a lot of force. Again, that usually indicates that you are angry, when you slam the door. Nancy says a couple of people at her work “st omped out and slammed the door, but they eventually,” meaning later, “came ba ck.” “I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead,” she says. The phrase “the silent treatment” (treatment) refers to a period of time when two peo ple don’t talk to each other because they are angry with each other. If you’re m arried, you know what I mean.

Mitch says, “So there was yelling?” “Yelling” comes  from the verb “to yell” (yell). “To yell” means to shout, to speak in a very loud v oice, usually because you’re angry. Nancy says, “Lots of yelling,” meaning yes, there was a lot of yelling. “They tried to talk over each other and wouldn’t ta ke turns,” she explains. “To talk over someone” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to  speak while another person is speaking, especially if you want to say s omething and don’t want to listen to the other person.

If you are arguing with another person, you may som etimes talk over that other person – talk when he or she is talking. My wife lo ves it when I talk over her during a discussion. That’s a joke. Nancy says the people at her work “tried to talk over each other and wouldn’t take turns (turns ).” “To take turns” means to allow someone else to do something that you are doi ng. First, I do it, then you do it, then another person does it, then another perso n does it, then I do it, and so forth. That’s “taking turns.” Everyone gets a chanc e or an opportunity to do something – in this case, to talk.

“After a while,” Nancy continues, “I wanted to dema nd some quiet time.” “Quiet time” is a period of silence when no one is allowed  to talk. She says, “No one would have paid me any attention,” however. “To pay  attention” means to do what the other person says to do, or at least to li sten to the other person. Mitch says, “That sounds like a lot of posturing.” The ve rb “to posture” (posture) means to behave or to act in a certain way in order to im press other people, to make other people think a certain way about you, or perh aps even to make other people afraid of you. “To posture” is to act in a c ertain way, to make you seem bigger or stronger or more powerful than you really  are.

Mitch says, “At least it didn’t devolve into hittin g and biting.” The verb “to devolve” (devolve) means to change into something worse. We might also use the verb “to deteriorate” or simply “to worsen” (worsen). Mitch says, “At least it didn’t devolve into hitting (hitting) and biting (biting).” “To hi t” someone is to use a part of your body, such as your hand or perhaps an object, a thi ng, to hurt that person by

moving it with force into that person. Normally, if  you hit someone, you are angry at that person.

“To bite” (bite) means to use your teeth, which are  inside of your mouth, to hurt another person. Normally we bite a piece of food wh en we are eating. You don’t normally bite another person. Once again, that woul d be something perhaps that a child would do. Nancy says, “Not yet,” meaning the people at her work had not yet started hitting and biting, but perhaps they wi ll in the future. In fact, she says, “I wouldn’t be surprised,” meaning it would not sur prise me – it would not be unusual, “if there is plenty of that” – that is, a lot of hitting and biting – “next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping  meets again.”

The final line of the dialogue then tells us where Nancy works. She works in Congress. She works in that part of our national or  federal government in Washington, D.C., that is composed of representativ es of the people. A “congressional subcommittee” is a group of people i n Congress that are discussing and are responsible for laws about a cer tain topic. This topic in the case of our dialogue is “peacekeeping” (peacekeepin g). “Peace” is the opposite of “war.” “Peacekeeping” means trying to prevent pe ople from fighting.

So of course, the joke in our dialogue here is that  this group of people, this congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping, is in f act a group of people who are always fighting each other and behaving badly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mitch: How was work today?

Nancy: Terrible. Nobody could get along and the nam e-calling started early.

Mitch: Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in so me other way?

Nancy: Several did. At one point, a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back. I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead.

Mitch: So there was yelling?

Nancy: Lots of yelling. They tried to talk over eac h other and wouldn’t take turns. After a while, I wanted to demand some quiet time, but no one would have paid me any attention.

Mitch: That sounds like a lot of posturing. At leas t it didn’t devolve into hitting and biting.

Nancy: Not yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if ther e is plenty of that next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping  meets again.

This episode is a dialogue between Harry and Debbie  about working in the music business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Harry: Our gig for this weekend is cancelled. They booked somebody else earlier but forgot.

Debbie: That’s a big bummer. I was counting on that  gig to pay rent.

Harry: Maybe I can get some session work at the stu dio.

Debbie: I’m so sick of being broke all the time.

Harry: I know, but this is our dream. We want to be  working musicians with a recording contract and worldwide tours, right? We a greed to devote all our time and energy to our music.

Debbie: That was the dream. The reality is that we’ re not doing too well. I’m thinking of packing it in.

Harry: You can’t! We agreed to give ourselves five years to make it. We both agreed that it’s better to have tried and failed th an never to have tried at all.

Debbie: But don’t you ever feel like giving up?

Harry: No! All we need is one big break.

Debbie: All right. I don’t want to think about it a nymore. Let’s rehearse.

Harry: I can’t. I’ve got to go.

Debbie: Where to?

Harry: To my brother’s restaurant. I agreed to wash  dishes there tonight.

Debbie: What happened to devoting all our time and energy to our music?

Harry: Even people with dreams have to eat.

[end of dialogue]

Harry begins by saying, “Our gig for this weekend i s cancelled.” A “gig” (gig) is a performance where someone is paid usually to play m usic in front of people – either a musical instrument or perhaps to sing. Har ry says that their gig for this weekend “is cancelled,” meaning they were supposed to have a performance but now they are not. He says, “They,” whoever they are , “booked somebody else earlier but forgot.” “They,” I guess, would be the owners of the place where they were going to perform.

“To book” (book) means to make arrangements to do s omething in the future. We use this verb in a lot of cases related to travel. You can “book a hotel.” You can “book an airplane flight.” In this case, it refers to a hotel or restaurant or bar arranging for someone to perform music in their est ablishment where they are. Harry says the place where they were going to perfo rm “had already booked somebody else but they forgot.” And so they also bo oked Harry and Debbie’s group.

Debbie says, “That’s a big bummer” (bummer). “Bumme r” is an informal word, a slang term, really, that describes something that i s very disappointing, something that makes you feel sad. It’s a word that was proba bly more popular twenty, thirty years ago than it is now, but you still hear it. De bbie continues, “I was counting on that gig to pay rent.” “To count (count) on” som ething or someone means to rely or depend on that thing or person. You are pre paring for the future based on something you are expecting to happen. Debbie was “ counting on the money” that she would have received from that performance,  that gig, to pay her rent.

Harry says, “Maybe I can get some session work at t he studio.” A “studio” (studio) is a room or building where music is recor ded. “Session (session) work” refers to time spent playing an instrument or singi ng with another group or band. Here in Los Angeles, for example, there are a lot of music studios and a lot of musicians, many of whom work doing session recordin gs. They are not recording

for their own bands. They are working with other mu sicians, other bands, other singers and playing with them. “Session work” is so mething many professional musicians count on in order to make a living – in o rder to have enough money to live.

Debbie says, “I’m so sick of being broke all the ti me.” If someone is “sick of” something, he is tired of it. He no longer wants th at particular thing. “I am sick of eating rice every day for lunch.” I want something different. Debbie is “sick of being broke” (broke). “To be broke” means not to ha ve any money. Harry says, “I know,” meaning I understand, “but this is our dream .” This is what you want. This is your hope for the future. “We want to be working  musicians with a recording contract and worldwide tours, right?”

Here he’s asking a question. Here he’s saying, “Don ’t you and I want to be working musicians with a recording contract?” A “re cording contract” is a legal agreement that you have with a music company. The m usic company pays you money and you record music that will be sold. A “to ur” (tour) is when you go from one place to another, performing something – in thi s case, performing music. Harry and Debbie want to be musicians with a “recor ding contract” and “worldwide tours,” meaning they go and perform thei r music all over the world.

Harry continues, “We agreed to devote all our time and energy to our music.” “To devote” (devote) means to give your time, money, or  other resources to a particular cause or for a particular goal. “I’m going to devote my time to studying Italian.” I’m going to spend an hour a day reading Italian to make my Italian vocabulary and grammar better. That, by the way, is  an excellent way to improve your English, in addition to listening to our episo des. Read at least a half hour every day, and your English will get better over ti me.

Well, Harry and Debbie want to devote all of their time and energy to their music. Debbie says, “That was the dream,” meaning yes, tha t’s what we thought. However, she continues, “The reality is that we’re not doing too well. I’m thinking of packing it in.” “Reality” (reality) is the way t hings actually are – not what we think or pretend or imagine, but the way the world actually is. Real life. Debbie says the reality of their lives is that they’re not  doing very well.

She says, “I’m thinking of packing it in.” The expr ession “to pack (pack) it in” means to give up, to stop doing something, usually because it’s too difficult. Harry says, “You can’t,” meaning you cannot pack it  in. You can’t stop. “We agreed to give ourselves five years to make it.” the expression “to make (make) it” means to succeed, to be successful, to get what  you want. Harry and Debbie

told themselves, agreed to themselves, to give them selves five years to make it, meaning they would try for five years to be success ful.

“We both agreed,” Harry continues, “that it’s bette r to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all.” This is an old express ion. “It’s better to have tried,” meaning it is better to have attempted something, “ and failed,” and not succeeded, “than never to have tried at all.” Basic ally the expression is saying that you should try something even if you’re not su ccessful, because it’s better to try and not be successful than never to attempt it in the first place. This is used to motivate people to get people who are having a hard  time or who are having difficulties to continue on or to try something eve n though it might be difficult.

Debbie says, “But don’t you ever feel like giving u p?” “To give up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning the same as “to pack it in” – to stop trying. Harry says, “No! All we need is one big break.” A “break” (break) he re refers to a good opportunity, a chance to do something. A “big break ,” then, would be a good opportunity to be successful. They often use this t erm in the entertainment industry, such as music or acting, to refer to that  one opportunity that will make you famous or that will give you the chance to be s uccessful.

Debbie says, “All right. I don’t want to think abou t it anymore. Let’s rehearse.” “To rehearse” (rehearse) means to practice usually musi c, although we also use this verb “to rehearse” for actors who are getting ready  for a performance, such as a play. Debbie says, “Let’s rehearse.” Harry says, “I  can’t. I have to go,” meaning I have to leave. Debbie says, “Where to?” Where are y ou going? Harry says, “To my brother’s restaurant. I agreed to wash dishes th ere tonight.”

Debbie asks, “What happened to devoting all our tim e and energy to our music?” Harry was talking about how important it was for the two of them to spend all of their time working on their music, and here he’s no w going to work in his brother’s restaurant. Harry explains, “Even people with dreams have to eat.” He’s saying that even though he has the dream of being a  successful musician, he still needs to make money in order to buy food to eat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Harry: Our gig for this weekend is cancelled. They booked somebody else earlier but forgot.

Debbie: That’s a big bummer. I was counting on that  gig to pay rent.

# Using an On-site Daycare

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,276 – Using an On-Site Daycare.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,276. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com for more information about our pod cast.

This episode is a dialogue between Francesca and Jo rge about using a place where you work, to take care of your young children . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Francesca: Hey, don’t we have a meeting at 1:30?

Jorge: We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kids are doing in the new on-site daycare.

Francesca: I didn’t even know we had an on-site day care.

Jorge: It’s something new the company is offering t o working parents. It’s a big perk and it’s great not having to drop off and pick  up my kids from a separate daycare every day.

Francesca: That’s nice.

Jorge: It’s really helped with the transition back to work from maternity and paternity leave. Finding the right childcare was tu rning out to be a big problem.

Francesca: We really missed you when you were away.

Jorge: Thanks. I’m also less distracted. I have pea ce of mind knowing the kids are here in the same building and I can check on th em anytime. It’s better for productivity.

Francesca: That’s good. Now should we get started w ith our meeting?

Jorge: Okay, but let’s keep it short. I want to che ck on the kids again in about 10 minutes.

 Francesca: How many times have you checked on them already?

Jorge: Four times.

Francesca: Just today?

Jorge: Just in the past hour.

[end of dialogue]

Francesca begins our dialogue by asking Jorge, “Hey ” – which is just a way of getting Jorge’s attention – “don’t we have a meetin g at 1:30?” Jorge says, “We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kid s are doing in the new on-site daycare.” The phrasal verb “to pop (pop) over” mean s to go or visit someone quickly and unexpectedly, without an appointment. “ I’m going to pop over and see my mom on the way to work.” I’m going to go and  see her not for a long meeting probably, certainly not for anything formal , but more as an informal visit.

We could also use the phrasal verb “to pop in” when  someone stops to talk to you with whom you didn’t have an appointment or who m simply you didn’t expect to see. We might use the two-word phrasal verb “pop ped in” – “He popped in to see me.” That means he came to see me for a short t ime and I probably wasn’t expecting him to see me or to visit me.

Jorge says he popped over to see how his kids were doing in the new on-site daycare. “On-site” (on-site) is an adjective used t o describe something that is in the same place as something else. So for example, i f you work in a building that also has a coffee shop in it, or a place where you can buy coffee, we might say that you have a coffee shop “on-site” where you wor k.

In this case, we’re talking about an “on-site dayca re” (daycare). The word “daycare” is used to describe a place that takes ca re of young children, usually children who are not old enough to go to school yet . In this case we’re talking about an “on-site daycare” – a place where parents can leave their children that is located in the same place where they work, or in  the same building. Jorge went to see his kids in the new on-site daycare. Frances ca says, “I didn’t even know we had an on-site daycare.”

Jorge says, “It’s something new the company is offe ring to working parents.” “Working parents” just means a mother or a father w ho also works outside of the home. In the last few decades or so, when someone u ses the verb “to work,”

they’ll often add the phrase “outside of the home” to indicate that the person has a job that requires them to go somewhere other than  their own house. The idea behind the expression really is to recognize that p eople who stay home with their children, mostly mothers, also are working. They’re  just not working outside of the home or working for extra pay.

Jorge says this new on-site daycare is a “big perk”  (perk). A “perk” is a special benefit that you get, usually at your job, in addit ion to being paid. Your company, for example, might have a gym in the building that you can use after work or before work. That would be a “perk” – a special or additional benefit that you get besides getting paid. Jorge says, “It’s great not h aving to drop off and pick up my kids from a separate daycare every day.”

The phrasal verb “to drop (drop) off” means to leav e a person or a thing at a particular place. Parents use this phrasal verb whe n talking about their children in situations where they are taking or transporting th eir child to one place and then later going back and getting the child from that sa me place. When they go back and get the child, we would use the phrasal verb “t o pick (pick) up.” “I’m going to drop off my child in the morning and pick him up an d take him back to my house in the afternoon.”

These two phrasal verbs can also be used more gener ally to refer to taking someone from one place to another. “I’m going to dr op off my brother at the airport.” That means I’m going to leave him there a nd then he will go on his plane and go somewhere else. When my brother comes back o r when my brother arrives at the airport, I would then go and “pick h im up.” So when someone says, “Can you pick me up at the airport?” he means “Can you go to the airport and take me from the airport to another place?” If some one asks you “to drop him off at the airport,” he means that he wants you to take  him from a certain place, his hotel or your house, to the airport.

Jorge thinks it’s great to be able to drop his chil d off at the daycare there where he works rather than having to drive somewhere else  and drop him off and then go to work. He continues by saying, “It’s really he lped with the transition back from maternity and paternity leave.” A “transition”  (transition) is a period of change from one situation to another. “Maternity” ( maternity) comes from the Latin word “mater,” meaning “mother.” “Maternity” r efers to something related to being a mother. “Paternity” (paternity) comes of co urse, for the Latin “pater” and that refers to something related to being a father.

The word “leave” (leave) refers to time away from y our work, when you don’t have to work. You may be getting paid – that would be called “paid (paid) leave”

– or it might be “unpaid leave.” You are away from your work for a week or a month or two months and you’re not being paid, but at the end of that time, you can come back to your job. A “leave” is when you are not working but you haven’t left your job. You still are able to come back to y our job when you are done with your leave.

A “paternity leave” is time that a company or an or ganization would give a father right after a child has been born so that the fathe r could stay home and help take care of the child. More common is a “maternity leav e,” where a mother leaves her work for a certain amount of time after a child is born to take care of the child. Jorge is obviously talking here about “paternity le ave,” since he wasn’t the mother of the child. I’m pretty sure.

He says, “Finding the right childcare was turning o ut to be a big problem.” “Childcare” (childcare) is when you arrange or you get someone else to take care of your child, either by having that person come to  your house or by taking your child to someone else’s place or house. Francesca s ays, “We really missed you when you were away.” Jorge says, “Thanks. I’m also less distracted.” “To be distracted” (distracted) means not focused, not abl e to think clearly about something because other things are bothering you.

Jorge continues, “I have peace of mind knowing the kids are here in the same building and I can check on them anytime.” “Peace ( peace) of mind” means you are relaxed, calm. You don’t feel anxious or worrie d. Jorge says he’s not worried because he knows his kids are there in the same bui lding as he is, and he can “check (check) on them.” “To check on” someone mean s to quickly see how someone is doing, to take a short amount of time to  make sure someone is okay. You may call your daughter or son, if they go away to college, every day or every week to check on them, to make sure they’re okay. A nd they, of course, will call you when they need money.

Jorge says that having the childcare there in the b uilding is better for “productivity” (productivity). “Productivity” refer s to the amount of work that a person or a group of people are able to complete in  a certain amount of time. Companies will often talk about the productivity of  their employees – how much the people that they pay to work for them get done in a certain amount of time. Francesca then says, “That’s good. Now should we ge t started with our meeting?”

Jorge says, “Okay, but let’s keep it short.” The ex pression “to keep it short” means to do it quickly so it doesn’t last very long . He says, “I want to check on the kids again in about 10 minutes.” Francesca then  asks him, “How many times

have you checked on them already?” Jorge says, “Fou r times.” Francesca then asks, “Just today?” And Jorge responds, “Just in the past hour,” meaning in the last 60 minutes, he’s checked on his children four times. Perhaps the on-site daycare isn’t as good for productivity as Jorge thi nks it is, or at least his company might think that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Francesca: Hey, don’t we have a meeting at 1:30?

Jorge: We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kids are doing in the new on-site daycare.

Francesca: I didn’t even know we had an on-site day care.

# Inconsiderate Subway/Train Passengers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,277 – Inconsiderate Subway and Train Passengers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,277. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com to find out more about our website .

This episode is a dialogue between Amanda and Felix  about riding on a subway or train with other people who aren’t very nice. Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amanda: I love the subway.

Felix: I do, too, but it really annoys me when peop le hog more than one seat, like that guy over there.

Amanda: Yeah, and I hate it when you’re trying to g et on the train and the passengers who are blocking the doors won’t move ou t of the way.

Felix: Oh, even worse is when you’re trying to get off the train and people who want to get on won’t wait until you get off.

Amanda: That’s totally annoying!

Felix: Even worse is when the train is full and peo ple squeeze to get on when there’s no more room!

Amanda: So true! I also hate it when people fall as leep and start invading my space. Last week, a guy fell asleep next to me and dropped into my lap. Gross!

Felix: What about when you’re holding onto a pole a nd somebody’s hand bumps yours and they don’t move away? That’s really annoy ing.

Amanda: Oh look, there’s a pregnant woman on the ot her end of the train and those guys aren’t giving up their seats for her. What jerks!

Felix: Yeah, what jerks! At least we don’t have any  singers, dancers, or loud entertainers on this train. I hate it when they sta rt performing.

Amanda: Actually, I kind of like it when people per form. It helps to pass the time.

Felix: Yeah, now that I think about it, I guess I d o, too. I love the subway.

Amanda: Me, too.

[end of dialogue]

Amanda begins our episode by saying to Felix, “I lo ve the subway.” The “subway” (subway) is an underground train – usually  underground – that is used to move people around a large city. Many cities hav e subway systems. Even Los Angeles has a subway system, but it isn’t very big.  New York, London, Paris, Tokyo – almost every major city has a subway system .

Nowadays we usually refer to the things you travel in in a subway as a “train,” although the word “train” (train) can also refer to  something that takes you a long distance, from one city to another. So when someone  says, “I’m going to take the train,” you have to know what he’s talking about to  understand if he means a subway train or a train that is going to travel a l ong distance to another city. Felix says he loves the subway too. “But,” he continues, “it really annoys me when people hog more than one seat, like that guy over t here.”

Obviously Amanda and Felix are having this conversa tion on a subway train. Felix says he’s “annoyed.” “To annoy” (annoy) means  to bother or frustrate someone, to make someone a little angry. Felix says  it annoys him when people “hog” (hog) more than one seat. “To hog” means to u se all of something and not let anyone else use it or have it, especially when we are referring to using more than what you should. “To hog” means not to share w ith other people. If someone is “hogging the seats,” they’re using more than one seat, more than what they need.

Amanda says, “Yeah, I hate it when you’re trying to  get on the train and the passengers who are blocking the doors won’t move ou t of the way.” Amanda is talking about something else that bothers her. She’ s bothered by the fact that sometimes when you are trying to get on a subway tr ain, there are passengers who block the doors. A “passenger” (passenger) is s omeone who is like you, riding on the train to go from one place to another .

You can talk about a passenger in a car, in a bus, on a train, in a boat, on an airplane, or in any vehicle or machine that moves s omeone from one place to another. A “passenger” is a person who is not drivi ng or directing the vehicle. Everyone else is a passenger. In a car, the person who drives the car is called, of course, the “driver.” Everyone else is a passenger.  Amanda doesn’t like passengers who “block (block) the door.” “To block”  means to be in the way of someone else so that the other person cannot pass t hrough or go by you.

These passengers, Amanda complains, don’t “move out  of the way.” “To move” or “to be out of the way” means not to be blocking someone else, not to be preventing someone else from being in that same spa ce. Felix says, “Oh, even worse is when you’re trying to get off the train an d people who want to get on won’t wait until you get off.” Amanda says, “That’s  totally annoying.” The word “totally” is an informal way of saying “very” or “c ompletely.”

Felix then gives another complaint. He says, “Even worse,” meaning even worse than what he just complained about, “is when the tr ain is full,” meaning all of the places in the train are taken, “and people squeeze to get on when there’s no more room.” “To squeeze” (squeeze) means to try to put more into a space than there is room for. If you squeeze onto a train, you  are trying to get onto the train even though there isn’t enough room on the train. S o you have to push other people, of course.

That’s what Felix is referring to when he says ther e’s no more “room” (room). In this sentence, “room” means space, or unused, avail able, empty space. Amanda says, “So true,” meaning yes, I agree with you. “I also hate it when people fall asleep and start invading my space.” “To invade (in vade) someone’s space” means to be too close to another person so that tha t person feels crowded or uncomfortable.

In the United States, there is a certain, what we w ould call, “personal space distance” between you and another person that you a re supposed to respect, that you’re not supposed to invade or go into. Thes e personal spaces are different in different cultures. In the U.S., the p ersonal space is probably a little bigger than in some other cultures, at least ones I ’ve been to where it’s not unusual for a person to be very close to you and no t think that he is invading your space.

Amanda hates it when people fall asleep on the subw ay and invade her space. She says, “Last week, a guy fell asleep next to me and dropped,” or fell into, “my lap” (lap). Your “lap” is the top of your legs, the  flat area made by your legs when you are sitting, the area above your knees. Amanda also says, “Gross” (gross).

“Gross” is an adjective we use for something that w e think is disgusting or something that makes us feel very uncomfortable. Sh e is expressing her dislike of what happened last week, or her disgust at what happened last week, when this man fell into her lap on the subway.

Felix says, “What about when you’re holding onto a pole and somebody’s hand bumps yours and they don’t move away. That’s really  annoying.” Most trains on the subway have “poles” (poles). A “pole” is a tall , vertical, usually, piece of metal that goes from the floor to the ceiling or top of t he train that you can hold onto in case you are standing. You don’t want to fall over when the train moves.

Felix is referring to what happens when someone els e’s hand “bumps” (bumps) your hand. The verb “to bump” here means to acciden tally, not on purpose, touch something or someone else. If another person’s hand  bumps yours or bumps into yours, that means the other hand touches yours. Ama nda says, “Oh look, there’s a pregnant woman at the other end of the train and those guys aren’t giving up their seats for her. What jerks!”

A “pregnant (pregnant) woman” is a woman who is exp ecting a child, a baby, but the baby hasn’t been born yet. It’s still inside the body of the woman. The guys on the other end of the train “aren’t giving up the ir seats for her,” Amanda says. “To give up your seat” for someone is to stand up a nd let another person sit where you were sitting, usually because the train i s crowded and there are no more seats left. Felix and Amanda both think these guys, these men or boys, are “jerks.” A jerk is a terrible person. It’s an insul ting word for a bad person.

Felix says, “At least we don’t have any singers, da ncers, or loud entertainers on this train. I hate it when they start performing.” In some subways, people will come on the train and sing or dance to try to get m oney from you, to try to get you to give them some money. These are “entertainer s” (entertainers). An entertainer is anyone who provides amusement or fun  for another person. A singer, a dancer, an actor – all of these people are entertainers. Felix doesn’t like it went entertainers come on the train and start en tertaining or performing.

Amanda disagrees. She says, “Actually I kind of lik e it when people perform. It helps pass the time.” “To pass (pass) the time” mea ns to spend time doing something so you don’t get bored. Some people on a subway pass the time by reading, some people listen to English lessons. Fel ix says, “Yeah, now that I think about it, I guess I do, too. I love the subwa y.” Amanda says, “Me, too.” Of course, they’ve just complained about the subway for the last few minutes, and now they end by saying that they actually love taki ng the subway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Amanda: I love the subway.

Felix: I do, too, but it really annoys me when peop le hog more than one seat, like that guy over there.

Amanda: Yeah, and I hate it when you’re trying to g et on the train and the passengers who are blocking the doors won’t move ou t of the way.

Felix: Oh, even worse is when you’re trying to get off the train and people who want to get on won’t wait until you get off.

Amanda: That’s totally annoying!

Felix: Even worse is when the train is full and peo ple squeeze to get on when there’s no more room!

Amanda: So true! I also hate it when people fall as leep and start invading my space. Last week, a guy fell asleep next to me and dropped into my lap. Gross!

Felix: What about when you’re holding onto a pole a nd somebody’s hand bumps yours and they don’t move away? That’s really annoy ing.

Amanda: Oh look, there’s a pregnant woman on the ot her end of the train and those guys aren’t giving up their seats for her. What jerks!

Felix: Yeah, what jerks! At least we don’t have any  singers, dancers, or loud entertainers on this train. I hate it when they sta rt performing.

Amanda: Actually, I kind of like it when people per form. It helps to pass the time.

Felix: Yeah, now that I think about it, I guess I d o, too. I love the subway.

Amanda: Me, too.

Go to ESLPod.com for more information about our epi sodes. This episode is a dialogue between Sam and Yasmin about going to a go od school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sam: I think our child should go to a public school . I did.

Yasmin: I went to a private prep school and I think  it gave me a leg up in life.

Sam: I got where I am without a fancy prep school.

Yasmin: And that’s great, but I think we should giv e our daughter every advantage we can.

Sam: What do you have in mind?

Yasmin: I have information here from a few of the m ost selective schools. Some are parochial and some are secular. Some are day sc hools and some are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not sending my daughter to a boarding scho ol and that’s final.

Yasmin: But some of the most exclusive schools are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not budging on that. I want her coming hom e every day.

Yasmin: All right. Let’s look at the admission crit eria for the remaining schools. Wow, admission is really competitive. These have ve ry low admission rates.

Sam: Really?

Yasmin: Really. They also require two aptitude test s in addition to transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.

Sam: Do we really want to put our daughter through that? And look at the tuition!

Yasmin: Is that for all four years?

Sam: No, for one year.

Yasmin: You’re kidding.

Sam: I’m not. Public school is sounding better and better, isn’t it?

[end of dialogue]

Sam begins our dialogue by saying, “I think our chi ld should go to a public school. I did.” In the United States, a “public (pu blic) school” is a school run by and paid for by the government. When I say the “gov ernment,” I’m referring to the local government usually, but public schools in all  cases are schools that are run by the government. That’s in American English. In B ritish English, a “public school” is what we would call a “private school.”

A “private (private) school” is a school that is no t run by the government. It might be run by a church or another organization. It migh t be run by a business. “Private schools” are any schools that are not run by the government. In British English, a “private school” is called a “public sch ool,” and a “public school” is called a “government school.” It’s a little confusi ng. In U.S. English, however, “public school” refers to a school run by the gover nment. “Private school” refers to a school run by some organization or group or bu sinesses other than the government.

Sam says that he wants his child to go to a public school. Yasmin says, however, “I went to a private prep school and I think it gav e me a leg up in life.” A “prep (prep) school” is also known as a “preparatory scho ol.” It’s supposed to be a school that is more difficult, that prepares you be tter to go to college. Yasmin says she went to a “private prep school” and that s chool “gave her a leg (leg) up in life.” “To be given a leg up in life” means to h ave an advantage over other people, to have something that allows you to be mor e successful in life – and certainly, a good education can help you “get a leg  up in life,” though not always. Look at me.

Sam says, “I got where I am without a fancy prep sc hool.” Notice Sam uses the adjective “fancy” (fancy) here. “Fancy” refers to s omething that is expensive or something that is for people with a lot of money. W e use that adjective “fancy” in other circumstances to mean slightly different thin gs, but here I think Sam is using it almost as an insult to say that he doesn’t  need, nor does his daughter need, a “fancy prep school.”

Yasmin says, “And that’s great,” meaning it’s great  Sam was able to do well without going to a prep school. She says, however, that she thinks “we should give our daughter every advantage we can.” Sam says , “What do you have in mind?” Yasmin responds, “I have information here fr om a few of the most selective schools.”

A “selective (selective) school” is a school that i s what we would describe as very “competitive,” meaning lots of people want to get i nto the school, and it is difficult to get “admitted to” or be allowed to attend that s chool. “Selective schools” usually only take a small percentage of the student s who want to get into the school. If a school is very good – like, say, Harva rd or Yale here in the United States, when referring to universities – those scho ols would be described as “selective” because many students want to go there but only a few are able to actually attend.

Yasmin says, “Some,” meaning some of the schools, “ are parochial and some are secular.” A “parochial (parochial) school” is a  school for children that is owned and run by or operated by a church, typically . The word “parochial” comes from the word “parish,” which usually refers to a l ocal church, a church in a certain area – a Christian church, typically, and m ost commonly a Catholic church. A “secular (secular) school” is a school th at is not related to any religion or church. It is what we might describe as “non-rel igious” – not religious.

Yasmin says, “Some are day schools and some are boa rding schools.” A “day (day) school” is a school that you send your child to during the day and then your child comes back to your house and lives with you, typically. A “day school,” that is, doesn’t provide a place for students to sleep a nd eat. If it did, we would call that a “boarding (boarding) school.”

Boarding schools are places that have rooms where s tudents live during the school year, and you, of course, send your child to  a boarding school and you don’t see your child until the end of that particul ar term or semester. Boarding schools are not very popular in the United States, though there are still boarding schools here in the U.S. They are more popular, at least among very rich families, in places such as England. In the U.S., t here is a tradition of boarding

schools especially on the eastern coast of the U.S.  They’re not as common here in California, but they do still exist.

Sam says, “I’m not sending my daughter to a boardin g school and that’s final,” meaning he’s not going to change his mind. Yasmin r esponds, “But some of the most exclusive schools are boarding schools.” “Excl usive” (exclusive) means available only to a small number of people, and ver y desirable. “Exclusive” refers to a group, a club, or a school that only a small n umber of people can be a part of. Sam says, “I’m not budging on that.” “To budge”  (budge) means to change your opinion or your position about something. Sam is “not budging” on his opinion, meaning he’s not going to change his opini on about sending his daughter to a boarding school. He is not going to d o that.

He says, “I want her coming home every day,” meanin g coming back to their house. Yasmin says, “All right. Let’s look at the a dmission criteria for the remaining schools.” “Admission (admission) criteria  (criteria)” are the requirements that a student must meet or must have in order to get into or be admitted to a school. If you want to go to Harvard or Berkeley here in the U.S., you must meet their “admission criteria,” which usu ally includes having very good grades, having good test scores, and so forth.

Yasmin and Sam are looking at the admission criteri a for these schools for their daughter. Yasmin says, “Wow, admission is really co mpetitive.” “Competitive” (competitive) means many people are trying to get s omething or do something. A “competitive school” is a school to which many stud ents are applying – many students want to go to that school. A school that i s competitive is usually a school that is also “selective,” meaning the school only t akes a certain number of students.

Yasmin notes that the schools she and Sam are looki ng at have “very low admission rates” (rates). The “admission rate” of a  school is the percentage of students that it accepts of the students who apply.  So, if a school has a 10 percent admission rate, that means that for every 1 00 students that want to go to that school, the school only accepts 10.

Sam says, “Really?” Yasmin says, “Really,” referrin g to the low admission rates. She says, “They also require two aptitude tests in addition to transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.” The requireme nts, then, for the schools that Sam and Yasmin are interested in are two aptit ude tests, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.

An “aptitude (aptitude) test” is a test that is sup posed to test or give an indication of your ability to do something. We used to disting uish between “aptitude tests” and “achievement tests.” An “achievement test” is a  test that looks at how much you know based on what you studied or what you have  read. An “aptitude test” is supposed to somehow indicate your ability to do som ething even if you haven’t studied it yet.

A lot of psychologists now question whether aptitud e tests are really able to test someone’s ability to do something in the future wit hout actually having tried it, but that’s what “aptitude” is. It’s your ability to do something. Aptitude is something that, at least according to some scientists, you are born with and therefore you cannot change. In any case, these schools “require two aptitude tests, in addition to transcripts” (transcripts).

A “transcript” is an official piece of paper or doc ument that lists, or puts down, all of the classes that you have taken as a student and  the grade that you received, or the mark that you received. “Letters of recommen dation” are letters written by people who know you as a student – or in this case,  your daughter – and can speak to or give information about how good a stude nt she is. An “interview” (interview) is, of course, when someone sits down a nd asks you questions about things.

Sam says, “Do we really want to put our daughter th rough that?” “To put someone through” something means to make someone do  something difficult or something that might require effort or even pain. S am then says, “Look at the tuition!” The “tuition” (tuition) of a school is ho w much it costs to go there, what the price is. Yasmin says, “Is that for all four ye ars?” meaning the tuition that they are looking at. Sam says, “No, for one year.”

Many private schools in the U.S. can be very expens ive. I mean, in some schools here in Los Angeles, it can cost $15,000 a year to send your child to a selective school, often more than it costs to send someone to  a year of college. Yasmin and Sam are obviously very surprised at the cost, t he tuition of the schools they have been looking at for their daughter. Yasmin say s, “Is that for all four years?” And Sam says, “No, for one year.”

Yasmin then says, “You’re kidding,” meaning you’re joking. Sam says, “I’m not. Public school is sounding better and better, isn’t it?” He means maybe because these other schools are so expensive, it would be b etter to send their child – and certainly cheaper to send their child – to a public  school. Public schools are supposed to be free in the United States. The gover nment doesn’t charge you or make you pay money to send your child to a public s chool.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sam: I think our child should go to a public school . I did.

Yasmin: I went to a private prep school and I think  it gave me a leg up in life.

Sam: I got where I am without a fancy prep school.

# Baking for People with Dietary Restrictions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,279 – Baking for People with Dietary Restrictions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,279. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com for more information about this po dcast.

This episode is a dialogue about making food for pe ople who can’t eat certain things, who have what we would call “dietary restri ctions.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gemma: I think we should have a bake sale. We’ll ra ise lots of money for our school.

Sebastian: A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too mu ch trouble.

Gemma: How much trouble can it be to bake a few coo kies and cakes?

Sebastian: It’s not as simple as that. We have to b e careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrictions.

Gemma: Like what?

Sebastian: Some people have ethical concerns. Vegan s, for example, don’t want any animal products in their food.

Gemma: Like eggs and milk?

Sebastian: That’s right. And other people have medi cal problems or conditions. Diabetics, for instance, want their baked goods mad e with sugar substitutes, and people who are lactose intolerant want dairy substi tutes.

Gemma: No sugar? No dairy?

Sebastian: And there is a whole slew of allergies t o consider, like people who have celiac disease, those who can’t eat gluten, an d those who are allergic to wheat or peanuts.

 Gemma: Wow, when did life get so complicated? How a bout a rummage sale instead?

Sebastian: Good idea.

[end of dialogue]

Gemma begins our dialogue by saying to Sebastian, “ I think we should have a bake sale.” A “bake (bake) sale (sale)” is when peo ple get together and bake individual cakes and other things that they then br ing and sell, well, in order to raise money or get money for an organization such a s a school or a church. A lot of schools and churches have bake sales where indiv idual members of that organization each make something at home and then bring it to the school or the church and sell it to people in order to get money for that organization.

Gemma says, “We’ll raise,” meaning we’ll get, “lots  of money for our school.” Sebastian says, “A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too much trouble,” meaning it’s too difficult. It will cause too many problems . Gemma says, “How much trouble can it be to bake a few cookies and cakes?”  A “cookie” (cookie) is a small, usually round, flat dessert that is typicall y made with some kind of dough – flour and water combined together and then cooked, with other things of course. Cookies are sometimes hard, sometimes soft, but usu ally small enough that you can pick it up and eat it with your hand.

A “cake” (cake) is a larger dessert, or thing that you would eat after a meal as something sweet, that is usually cut up into smalle r pieces so you can eat it. A cake is usually eight or 10 inches around, or it co uld be a big square cake like you would have at someone’s birthday party. Cake of ten has what is called “frosting” (frosting) on top of it. Frosting is a s weet, colored usually, layer of some sort of butter cream or other sweet spread that goe s on top of the cake.

Sebastian says, “It’s not as simple as that.” Gemma  thinks it won’t be difficult to have this bake sale. Sebastian disagrees. He says, “We have to be careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrict ions.” “Baked (baked) goods (goods)” refers to any kind of sweet food that is b aked in an “oven” (oven). An oven is where you put food to cook it, to make it w arm. An oven is basically a warm box that is heated.

“Dietary” (dietary) refers to food – the things you  eat. A “restriction” is something that you cannot do, a limitation on what you can, i n this case, eat. So, “dietary restrictions” would be things that for whatever rea son, often a medical reason,

you cannot eat. I, for example, cannot eat “shellfi sh” – things such as shrimp and crab, because I have an allergy. If I eat it, my bo dy reacts in a bad way. That’s a dietary restriction I have, which is too bad becaus e I really love shrimp and crab, but a few years ago I started having a reaction to that food, I’m not sure why, and now that’s one of my dietary restrictions.

Gemma asks what sort of dietary restrictions they w ould have to worry about for their bake sale. Sebastian then begins by saying, “ Some people have ethical concerns.” “Ethical” (ethical) refers to what you t hink is right or wrong, what you believe is morally correct. Sebastian is talking ab out dietary restrictions not for someone’s health, but because of what someone might  believe, their ethics.

He says, “Vegans,” for example, don’t want any anim al product in their food.” A “vegan” (vegan) is a person who does not eat or use  any animal products. No meat. No eggs. No milk. In many cases, no honey. Th at would be things that a vegan would not eat or not want to eat. It might no t be for an ethical concern, however, but for some vegans that’s probably true. Gemma then says, “Like eggs and milk?” Sebastian says, “That’s right.” Tho se are things a vegan would not eat.

He continues, “And other people have medical proble ms or conditions. Diabetics, for instance, want their baked goods made with suga r substitutes, and people who are lactose intolerant want dairy substitutes.”  A “diabetic” (diabetic) is someone who has a disease called “diabetes,” which relates to the blood sugar and insulin in their body – chemicals in their body  that have to be regulated because of the disease.

One of the things that diabetics usually avoid is s ugar, and therefore, they would want “sugar substitutes.” A “substitute” (substitut e) is when you replace one thing with another thing. I used to put sugar in my coffe e. Now I don’t. Now I use a “sugar substitute,” something that makes the coffee  sweet but isn’t sugar, although that might kill me also. I don’t know, but  I’m still going to drink my coffee.

Diabetics want sugar substitutes. People who are “l actose (lactose) intolerant (intolerant)” want “dairy (dairy) substitutes.” “La ctose” is a kind of sugar that is found in milk. “Milk” is an example of a “dairy pro duct.” The word “dairy” means related to or made from milk. In the U.S., that’s u sually milk that comes from a cow. A “cow” is an animal that goes “Moo, moo.” You  know what I’m talking about, right? So, if you are “lactose intolerant,” you cannot have milk or dairy products because that bothers your stomach and give s you a bad reaction. There

are lots of people who are lactose intolerant, who cannot drink a lot of milk or dairy because it makes them sick.

Gemma then says, “No sugar? No dairy?” Sebastian co ntinues, “And there is a whole slew of allergies to consider.” A “slew” (sle w) of something is a large number of something. A “slew of allergies” (allergi es) would be many different allergies, or kinds of conditions that make someone  feel sick after they eat, touch, or smell something. An “allergy” is a condit ion in which your body reacts negatively to something that it is near or somethin g that you eat. I have an allergy to shellfish to shrimp. When I eat it, I start to l ook like a shrimp – my skin turns red.

In addition to allergies, there are some people, pr obably a smaller number than is actually reported in the news, who have what is cal led “celiac disease.” “Celiac (Celiac) disease” is a medical condition which caus es people who eat certain kinds of wheat, barley, rye, or similar grains to e xperience negative effects such as pain in their stomach. People who have celiac di sease usually can’t eat anything that contains “gluten” (gluten). “Gluten” is a certain substance, what’s called a “protein” (protein), that is found in many  kinds of grain. It’s very difficult to make a lot of baked goods such as bread and cake wi thout having gluten in it.

Sebastian also mentions people who are “allergic to  wheat (wheat) or peanuts (peanuts).” “Wheat” is a kind of plant that is ofte n used in a different form in baking and cooking. “Flour” (flour) is often made f rom wheat. You take the wheat and you grind it, or you make it into what is essen tially a powder, and that powder is mixed with water or some other liquid to make what is called “dough” (dough). You put that dough in the oven and it bake s, and you get wonderful bread and cake and other things.

“Peanuts” is one kind of nut that is quite popular in the United States. I don’t like peanuts, myself, because I didn’t grow up eating pe anuts. Why? My older brothers are allergic to peanuts. They have an alle rgy to peanuts. When they eat peanuts, they have a negative reaction just like wh en I eat shrimp. I don’t really like peanuts. Many Americans love a product made fr om peanuts called “peanut butter,” but I have never had peanut butter because  I didn’t grow up eating peanuts and I don’t really like the taste. It’s alm ost un-American not to like peanut butter, but I do not.

Anyway, back to our story. Gemma says, “Wow, when d id life get so complicated?” “When did things become so difficult? ” is what she’s saying. She then says, “How about a rummage sale, instead?” Ins tead of having a bake sale, Gemma suggests a “rummage (rummage) sale.” A rummag e sale is when people

bring not baked goods from their houses, but things  they don’t want – chairs, electronics, dishes, books. They bring all of these  things to the church or the school and they sell those instead of cakes and coo kies. That’s a “rummage sale.”

Sometimes people will call these a “garage sale” ev en though the sale isn’t done in a garage. In British English, they sometimes ref er to a “boot (boot) sale.” The “boot” is the back part of your car. The idea being  that you would go somewhere and put things in the back of your car and then ope n up the back of the car so people could see what you are selling and you could  sell it from there. The “boot” in the United States, on a car, is called the “trun k” (trunk).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gemma: I think we should have a bake sale. We’ll ra ise lots of money for our school.

Sebastian: A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too mu ch trouble.

Gemma: How much trouble can it be to bake a few coo kies and cakes?

Sebastian: It’s not as simple as that. We have to b e careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrictions.

# Describing Poor Audio Quality

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,280 – Describing Poor Audio Quality.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,280. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Young and Silvia  about listening to something that is not recorded very well – that has  poor audio quality. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Young: We have a major problem. The audio on the ne w presentation is really awful.

Silvia: Really? Let me listen to it. Oh, the volume  fluctuates and keeps cutting out. We even have long periods of dead air!

Young: That’s only one of the many problems. Keep l istening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background. Sometimes it’s so loud  that it drowns out all other sounds.

Silvia: Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. Some speakers sound garbled and others sound muffled.

Young: And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.

Silvia: What are we going to do?

Young: I guess we can try to remaster it and see if  we can make any improvements.

Silvia: What if we can’t?

Young: Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions!

[end of dialogue]

Young begins our dialogue by saying to Silvia, “We have a major problem.” “Major” (major) means a big or important problem. Y oung says, “The audio on the new presentation is really awful” – is really b ad, or terrible. “Audio” (audio) is sound that you hear that is recorded or copied. Usu ally it is recorded on some sort of electronic device. Most movies have “video”  (video) as well as “audio.” “Video” is what you can see, what is recorded visua lly. “Audio” is what you can hear.

A “presentation” (presentation) is usually some inf ormation that is given to someone that includes both sound and visual informa tion. A presentation at your office, where you work, might be someone standing u p in front of you and talking about information, giving you information and showi ng you things. That’s a “presentation.” “The audio on the new presentation, ” according to Young, “is really awful.” Silvia says, “Really?” She’s surpris ed. She then says, “Let me listen to it.” “Oh,” she says, “the volume fluctuates and keeps cutting out.” The “volume” (volume) of something is how loud it is. It is a me asure of how much sound is being produced, we could say.

We talk about a “high volume” and a “low volume.” S omething that is on “low volume” is not very loud. If you want to increase t he volume, we would use the phrasal verb “turn it up” or “turn up the volume.” “To turn up the volume” means to increase the volume, to make something louder. T he opposite would be “to turn down (down) the volume.” Here, the volume “flu ctuates” (fluctuates). “To fluctuate” means to vary – to increase and then dec rease, but not in a constant or steady way, to go up and down unpredictably.

The phrasal verb “to cut (cut) out” can mean simply  to stop, but here it means for the sound to stop temporarily and then to begin aga in. If someone says the audio is “cutting out,” he means you can hear it and then  suddenly you can’t hear it, and then you can hear it again. You know, what happ ens sometimes when you are listening to your music through your headphones  or your earbuds on your phone, and suddenly you can’t hear the music, and t hen you can hear the music. That’s usually because you have a bad connection, p erhaps. The wire is bad. That’s what we mean by audio “cutting out.”

Silvia says, “We even have long periods,” or long a mounts of time, “of dead (dead) air (air).” “Dead air” is usually a phrase w e associate with television or radio, when there is suddenly no sound. You can’t h ear anything. That is usually because there is some technical problem at the radi o station. Well, in this presentation, which was recorded electronically, th ere are times when there is dead air – and that of course is not good.

Young says, “That’s only one of the many problems. Keep listening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background.” “Static” (s tatic) is noise in a recording that you don’t want there. Here’s an example of static t hat, if you’re old enough to remember, you might have heard on what we used to c all a “record player,” something that played old vinyl albums. Listen. [st atic] That’s an example of static. There is static, Young says, “in the backgr ound” (background).

The “background” is what you hear in addition to the person talking on the audio. It’s the other noise in the room, or other noise th at is present in addition to the person talking, or perhaps the music that is being played. Young says, “Sometimes it” – meaning the static – “is so loud t hat it drowns out the other sounds.” “To drown (drown) out” is a two-word phras al verb meaning for the noise or the sound to be louder than something else  so that you can’t hear what you want to hear.

If I’m talking to you and suddenly there’s a big mo torcycle that drives by and makes a lot of noise, if that noise is very loud, it might drown me out. You won’t be able to hear me because the noise of the motorcy cle is too loud. My neighbor likes to sing to himself sometimes, very loudly, an d that sometimes drowns out my television that I am listening to, so I have to turn my television volume up, and then he sings louder, and then I turn my television  up even louder. You get the idea.

Silvia says, “Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. ” “To be distorted” (distorted) means to be difficult to hear or to understand, usu ally because there is some problem with the recording or because the device yo u are listening to has a problem. A voice that is “distorted” might be one t hat is suddenly very high or very low. This would be an example of a distorted v oice. That’s really bad distortion. I apologize for that.

Silvia continues, “Some speakers,” meaning some of the people who are talking, “sound garbled and others sound muffled.” If someon e sounds “garbled” (garbled), he is difficult to understand. It’s simi lar to “distorted.” “Muffled” (muffled) is when sound is not loud enough, perhaps  because someone is covering the microphone or someone is not speaking very clearly. Young says, “And when you can make out what the speakers are sa ying, their voices are tinny.”

“To make (make) out what someone is saying” means t o be able to understand what the other person is saying. We also use this p hrasal verb when we are trying to read something that is very difficult bec ause it isn’t written very clearly – maybe it was written with a pencil and it’s hard to  read. “I can’t make out what

this says.” I can’t understand it. Young also compl ains that some of the people in the recording have voices that sound “tinny” (tinny ). If you have a “tinny” voice, it’s very high-pitched or difficult to understand. Well, that’s even more than tinny.

Silvia then says, “What are we going to do?” Young says, “I guess we can try to remaster it and see if we can make any improvements .” “To remaster” (remaster) is to use technology to improve the quality of soun d that was recorded before, or often many years ago. Sometimes movie studios here in Los Angeles, movie companies, will “remaster” old movies, trying to im prove the sound and the way they look. We usually use this term, however, to re fer to improving the audio quality of something.

Silvia asks, “What if we can’t?” meaning what if we  cannot remaster the audio to make it sound better. Young says, “Worse comes to w orst? We’ll use captions.” The expression “worse (worse) comes to worst (worst )” is used to mean or describe a bad situation that gets even worse, that  becomes as bad as possible. Young says in the worst situation, “We’ll use capti ons” (captions). “Captions” are when you have the words to what you are watching on  the screen.

Captions are used in television and sometimes in mo vies when a person is difficult to understand, and so you put the words of what that person is saying on the bottom of the screen so that you can read them as well as listen to them. Watching programs, television shows, that are “capt ioned” in the language of the show – that is, not translated, but actually the sa me words that are being spoken by the person on the show or in the movie – is actu ally a very good way of improving your English. There’s some good scientifi c research about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Young: We have a major problem. The audio on the ne w presentation is really awful.

Silvia: Really? Let me listen to it. Oh, the volume  fluctuates and keeps cutting out. We even have long periods of dead air!

Young: That’s only one of the many problems. Keep l istening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background. Sometimes it’s so loud  that it drowns out all other sounds.

Silvia: Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. Some speakers sound garbled and others sound muffled.

Young: And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.

Silvia: What are we going to do?

Young: I guess we can try to remaster it and see if  we can make any improvements.

Silvia: What if we can’t?

Young: Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions!

# Going to the Playground

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,281 – Going to the Playground.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,281. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Patrick and Mary  about going to a place where children can play – called a “playground,” of  course. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patrick: Hi, do you mind if I sit on this bench wit h you?

Mary: No, be my guest. We’ve just moved to the neig hborhood and we love having a playground around the corner.

Patrick: It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to bring t he kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy?

Mary: Definitely. I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider. It’s her favorite. Is that your son on the slide?

Patrick: It is. Over there, I have two other sons p laying on the merry-go-round. They’re the ones wearing green.

Mary: Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?

Patrick: My son Frankie and daughter Terese are on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them?

Mary: Oh, sure. Are those two on the seesaw yours, too?

Patrick: They are, and those three boys on the swin gs are mine, too. Over there, you’ll see another one of my sons swinging on the t rapeze rings, and right here is my youngest playing in the sandbox.

Mary: Wait, how many children do you have?

 Patrick: Only 11.

[end of dialogue]

A “playground” (playground) is an outdoor area wher e children can play, usually on large pieces of equipment, some of which we’ll b e talking about in this episode. Our dialogue begins with Patrick saying to  Mary, “Hi, do you mind” – meaning is it okay, or does it bother you – “if I s it on this bench with you?” A “bench” (bench) is a long, flat seat that usually t hree or four people can sit on. You find benches in parks, in bus stations, in othe r public areas. They are places where you can sit down. The bench here has room for  at least two people, since Patrick is asking to sit next to Mary.

Mary responds to Patrick by saying, “No, be my gues t,” meaning no, it doesn’t bother me. I don’t mind. “Be my guest” (guest). The  phrase “Be my guest” is used when someone is asking something from you or reques ting something from you. Often it involves allowing the person to use someth ing or to do something that is involved somehow with that person. For example, you ’re sitting at a table, at a dinner table, and someone says, “Can I have that la st piece of apple pie” or “that last piece of cake?” The other person may respond “ Be my guest,” meaning “Go ahead, that’s fine. I don’t mind.”

So Mary says to Patrick, “Be my guest,” meaning yes , you can sit next to me. She then says, “We’ve just moved to the neighborhoo d and we love having a playground around the corner.” Mary is talking abou t, we are guessing, herself and her family who have just moved to this neighbor hood, this area of the city. She says they “love having a playground around the corner.” “Around the corner” means very close to where you live.

Patrick says, “It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to bring the kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy.” “Exercise” ( exercise) is things you do with your body, usually to make yourself healthier or st ronger, or perhaps for some people to lose weight. That’s called “exercise.” It  could be running. It could be doing other sorts of activities that require you to  work your body hard.

“To burn (burn) off some energy (energy)” means, in  this case, to have the children do some physical activity so that later, t hey’re calmer or perhaps tired and want to go to sleep. Sometimes parents will tak e their children somewhere so that the children will run around, will do a lot  of activity or a lot of exercise, so that later the children are quiet because they’re t ired. Mary agrees with Patrick that it’s nice to be able to bring the kids to this  playground to get some exercise.

 She says, “I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider.” A “spring (spring) rider (rider)” is something that you may find in a playgr ound. It often looks like an animal, or perhaps a car. It moves around and goes up and down when a child sits on it. It’s often made from wood or plastic. T he important thing in a “spring rider” is that it is attached to or connected to a metal spiral – something made of a very strong, long tube of metal that goes around and around in a circle. That’s called a “spring.”

A “spring” is made out of a long, thin or thick pie ce of metal that is curled around. It goes around in a circle. We would call it a “coi l” (coil). If you push a spring down and then remove your hand, the spring will com e back up. Well, a “spring rider” isn’t so much about the child moving up and down, but more side to side, I think. To be honest, we didn’t have spring riders w hen I was a child at the playgrounds I used to go to, but I think that’s wha t it is. Mary says that her daughter is on a spring rider and that it’s her “fa vorite,” meaning it’s the ride or it’s the thing at the playground she likes the most.

Then Mary asks Patrick, “Is that your son on the sl ide (slide)?” A “slide” can best be compared to a hill. When you go skiing, at least  downhill skiing, you go from the top of the hill to the bottom of the hill. A “s lide” is like an artificial hill except it isn’t wide. It’s very narrow and is usually made of  just a piece of metal that one person can slide down or go down from the top to the bottom. To get to the top, you have to climb what is called a “ladder” (ladder ), which is like a series of steps that you go up.

Patrick says that it is his son on the slide. He co ntinues, “Over there, I have two other sons playing on the merry-go-round. They’re t he ones wearing green.” A “merry (merry) – go (go) – round (round)” is a larg e, flat circle usually made of metal, and into the circle there are things that yo u can hang onto with your hands. This circle is attached to a pole in the mid dle of the circle, and it goes around in a circle. In order to make it go around, you have to push it so that it moves around. That’s a “merry-go-round.” Sometimes is called a “roundabout.”

Now, if you go to a circus – a place that has anima ls, for example, and other games to play – you will also see a merry-go-round,  but that’s a little different. That’s a merry-go-round that is operated electronic ally. You don’t have to push it. And often, instead of just hanging onto a pole with  your hands, there are things that you sit on that are shaped like horses. That’s  a little different kind of merry- go-round. A playground merry-go-round is just typic ally a large round disc that goes around in a circle if you push it.

Patrick says his two sons are on the merry-go-round . Mary says, “Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?” “Do you have other c hildren?” Mary is asking. Patrick says, “My son Frankie and daughter Terese a re on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them?” A “jungle (j ungle) gym (gym)” is something that kids can climb on. It is usually mad e of wood or metal and it can take a variety of different forms or shapes. “To ha ng” (hang) means to hold on to something, usually with your hands, while the rest of your body is not touching anything else.

A “jungle gym” has high bars that kids can grab ont o or hang onto with their hands and arms. “Monkey (monkey) bars (bars)” is an other piece of playground equipment. It’s basically a ladder that is up in the air, and horizontal rather than vertical. What you do is you jump up and you put your hand on one of the bars. I guess we could call it one of the “rungs” (rungs). A ladder has what are called “rungs.” Those are basically the steps that you put  your feet on when you go up the ladder.

A “monkey bar” is not a vertical structure, but rat her a horizontal one. So you have two other structures usually made out of metal  or wood that hold the monkey bars up in the air. So the monkey bars are b asically on top of these other structures. Monkey bars allow you to go from one en d of the ladder, if you will, one end of the monkey bars to the other.

Mary sees Patrick’s two children and says, “Are tho se two on the seesaw yours, too?” meaning “yours, also?” A “seesaw” (seesaw) is  sometimes called a “teeter (teeter) – totter (totter).” A “teeter-totter” (say  that 10 times fast), or a “seesaw,” is basically a flat piece of wood or metal that is bal anced in the middle, allowing one child to go up and the other child to go down. So o ne child goes up and the other one goes down. In fact, we have a verb “to seesaw,”  which means to go up and down constantly.

Patrick says yes, the two on the seesaw are his chi ldren. And he says, “Those three boys on the swings are mine, too.” “Swings” ( swings) are basically seats – things you sit on – that are connected to long chai ns, long thin ropes, or chains that are themselves connected to a high bar above y ou. The swing allows you to go back and forth in the air while sitting down.

Patrick says, “Over there, you’ll see another one of my sons swinging on the trapeze rings.” A “trapeze (trapeze) ring (ring)” i s a metal ring that is connected to a long piece of rope or a long chain that you can s wing from, back and forth, by holding onto it with your hands. Patrick also menti ons his youngest son “is playing in the sandbox” (sandbox). A “sandbox” is a  large box that is filled with,

not surprisingly, “sand” – something that you would  find, say, on a beach by the ocean.

Mary says, “Wait, how many children do you have?” P atrick responds, “Only 11.” Well, 11 is not that big of a family. I am the youn gest of 11 children. And by coincidence, by chance, my parents were named Patri ck and Mary.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patrick: Hi, do you mind if I sit on this bench wit h you?

Mary: No, be my guest. We’ve just moved to the neig hborhood and we love having a playground around the corner.

Patrick: It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to bring t he kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy?

Mary: Definitely. I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider. It’s her favorite. Is that your son on the slide?

Patrick: It is. Over there, I have two other sons p laying on the merry-go-round. They’re the ones wearing green.

Mary: Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?

Patrick: My son Frankie and daughter Terese are on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them?

Mary: Oh, sure. Are those two on the seesaw yours, too?

Patrick: They are, and those three boys on the swin gs are mine, too. Over there, you’ll see another one of my sons swinging on the t rapeze rings, and right here is my youngest playing in the sandbox.

Mary: Wait, how many children do you have?

Patrick: Only 11.

# Working in a Scientific Field

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,282 – Working in a Scientific Field.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,282. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Shirley and Ira about working in a job related to science.

Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ira: It’s amazing that everybody in your family wor ks in the sciences.

Shirley: Yeah, my parents are both in the social sc iences. My father is a psychologist and my mother is an economist.

Ira: And your sister Shonda?

Shirley: She’s an astronomer. She initially wanted to study physics, but changed her mind. Her partner is a geologist.

Ira: Is your brother also in astronomy?

Shirley: No, he’s a biologist and his wife does che mistry research.

Ira: How about your other brother? What does he do?

Shirley: Um, we don’t . . . I mean he’s not involve d in the social sciences, life sciences, or physical sciences.

Ira: If I remember correctly, he was always good at  math and liked computers. Is he in computer science?

Shirley: No, he’s not. All right, he’s a writer, bu t we have every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.

[end of dialogue]

 Ira starts our dialogue by saying, “It’s amazing th at everybody in your family works in the sciences.” The word “sciences” (scienc es) – in the plural form – usually refers to different areas, what we call “fi elds (fields) of study,” including areas of the academic or research world that look a t natural and physical sciences. Shirley says, “Yeah,” which is an informa l way of saying yes. “My parents are both in the social sciences.”

Now, I just defined “the sciences” as relating to t he physical and natural world. Part of the natural world includes people, of cours e, and that means that the sciences also includes the study of human beings an d how they interact with each other. The “social (social) sciences” are scie nces that study human beings and their interactions, things that would include s ociology and psychology, anthropology – some people perhaps would also inclu de history, although history, according to some people, is more like ano ther area of study called “the humanities,” which would include the study of art a nd literature.

In any case, the social sciences includes things su ch as psychology and economics. Shirley says, “My father is a psychologi st,” someone who studies the human mind, and her mother “is an economist,” someo ne who studies the way money is made and the way that human beings relate to each other when it comes to selling and buying things. Ira says, “And your sister Shonda?” Shirley replies that her sister is an “astronomer” (astrono mer). An astronomer is a person who studies the planets and the stars and other obj ects out in what we would call “outer space” – the area beyond the Earth.

Shirley says that her sister “initially,” meaning a t the beginning, perhaps at the beginning of her studies, “wanted to study physics,  but changed her mind.” “Physics” (physics) is the study of physical object s and how they move and are influenced by natural forces such as gravity and ma gnetism. Her sister “changed her mind,” meaning she changed her opinion. She dec ided to do something different, in this case.

“Her partner is a geologist,” Shirley says. A “part ner” (partner) can mean someone with whom you run a business. A “business p artner” is a person with whom you have a share of or share responsibility in  a business. More recently, the word “partner” has been used to describe someon e with whom you are in a romantic relationship with. I’m not sure if this or iginally came from British English. I used to notice it in British English a few years ago. It has become more popular in American English more recently.

A “partner” is a general term for either your boyfr iend, your girlfriend, your husband, or your wife. I don’t think there are any other possibilities there, at least within the human race. In any case, that’s a “partn er.” Not one of my favorite words. I prefer people just say what they mean. If you mean your boyfriend, then say your boyfriend. Anyway, that’s my own personal complaint.

A “geologist” (geologist) is a person who studies t he earth – what the earth is made of, things inside of the earth like rocks. I h ad a good friend from high school who wanted to be a geologist. He even starte d a master’s program in geology, but he decided not to continue studying it . This was back in the late 1980s, the mid-1980s – 1986, 1987. He decided there  wasn’t any money in geology and so he changed his focus to computers.

Now, I think if he were to make the same decision a gain he might continue in his studies of geology. Geologists, at least in the Uni ted States, are often employed, or given jobs, in the new oil industry – the oil bu sinesses that have grown so much in the past 20 years in the U.S. In any case, Shirley’s sister’s boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife is a geologist.

Ira says, “Is your brother also in astronomy?” Shir ley says, “No, he’s a biologist and his wife does chemistry research.” A “biologist ” (biologist) is a scientist who studies living organisms – plants and animals, for example. When I first moved to California, I lived with a couple of biologists who  were getting their PhD in biology from Claremont College – Claremont University or so mething. I don’t remember very well. It was a long time ago.

Anyway, in our story, Shirley’s brother’s wife – th at would make her Shirley’s sister-in-law – works in the field or the area of “ chemistry” (chemistry). “Chemistry” is the study of what materials are made  of and how the elements of the materials interact and relate to each other. Ch emistry studies things like small molecules, and what’s inside the molecules, and wha t the molecules are made of – how the different elements react to each other. I ra says, “How about your other brother?” meaning tell me about your other brother.  “What does he do?”

Shirley says, “Um, we don’t . . . I mean he’s not i nvolved in the social sciences, life sciences, or physical sciences.” Shirley doesn ’t want to talk about the other brother she has. I guess because he’s not in “the s ocial sciences, life (life) sciences,” or physical sciences. “Life sciences” are those fields that study any kind of life. That would include biology, zoology, botany, biochemistry, microbiology – those are all life sciences. The phy sical sciences are things like chemistry and geology and physics and astronomy.

Ira says, “If I remember correctly, he” – meaning S hirley’s brother – “was always good at math and liked computers.” “Math” (math) is  a short form of the word “mathematics.” In British English, they put an “s” at the end. They say “maths,” but we say “math” without the “s.” Ira asks, “Is he ,” meaning your brother, “in computer science?” “Computer science” is of course the study of computers. Shirley says, “No he’s not.”

Then she says, “All right,” in a way that indicates  that she didn’t really want to talk about him but now she will. “All right, he’s a writ er,” she says. A “writer” (writer) is, of course, a person whose job is to create thin gs by writing them – by typing them or writing them down. Nowadays, of course, eve ryone does it on a computer. A writer could be someone who writes fict ion, such as stories, or poetry. A writer could be someone who writes for a newspaper or writes books about things that are real.

Shirley says, “We,” meaning she and her family, “ha ve every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.” Shirley says that she and her fami ly hope that their brother will “grow out of it.” That’s what she means when she sa ys they have “every confidence” (confidence). “To have every confidence  of” something, or “to have every confidence that” something, means that you ha ve no doubts – that you are sure something will happen in the future. What Shirley and her family are sure of is that the  brother, who is a writer, will “grow out of it.”

The expression “to grow out of” something means to become older and wiser, or more mature, so that you’re no longer interested in  this particular area or that you no longer have certain problems that we normally as sociate with, or think are related to, someone’s young age. As we grow older, we grow out of some of the things that we liked when we were children. Shirley  and her family don’t believe that being a writer is a very good thing, and that’ s why they hope that the brother in the family will grow out of his love of writing,  I guess.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ira: It’s amazing that everybody in your family wor ks in the sciences.

Shirley: Yeah, my parents are both in the social sc iences. My father is a psychologist and my mother is an economist.

Ira: And your sister Shonda?

 Shirley: She’s an astronomer. She initially wanted to study physics, but changed her mind. Her partner is a geologist.

Ira: Is your brother also in astronomy?

Shirley: No, he’s a biologist and his wife does che mistry research.

Ira: How about your other brother? What does he do?

Ira: If I remember correctly, he was always good at  math and liked computers. Is he in computer science?

Shirley: No, he’s not. All right, he’s a writer, bu t we have every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.

# Forgetting Someone¡¦s Birthday

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,283 – Forgetting Someone’s Birthday.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,283. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Where else?

This episode is a dialogue between Gretchen and Hug h about forgetting when someone’s birthday is. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gretchen: I thought you were going out with your gi rlfriend tonight. What are you doing here watching TV?

Hugh: She’s mad at me.

Gretchen: Why?

Hugh: I forgot her birthday. It was last Tuesday an d it completely slipped my mind. I forgot to put a reminder on my calendar. Sh e’s moping and giving me the silent treatment.

Gretchen: What are you going to do to make up for f orgetting her birthday?

Hugh: I’m just going wait it out and let it blow ov er. She’ll get over it.

Gretchen: Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?

Hugh: I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her someth ing really special then.

Gretchen: I don’t think it works that way. She’s no t going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be sore spot.

Hugh: It’s not like I did something really bad that  I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?

Gretchen: Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .

 Hugh: You’re not her. I apologized. Sooner or later , she’ll realize she’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apo logy.

Gretchen: Okay, if you say so.

[end of dialogue]

Gretchen begins by saying to Hugh, “I thought you w ere going out with your girlfriend tonight.” “To go out with” someone means  to go somewhere such as a restaurant, a theater, or a park to have fun. “What  are you doing here watching television?” Gretchen asks. Hugh says, “She’s mad a t me,” meaning his girlfriend is mad at him. She’s feeling anger toward him. Usua lly this happens because you have done something wrong with your girlfriend. Tha t’s the way it works, guys.

Gretchen says, “Why?” Why is she mad at you? Hugh s ays, “I forgot her birthday.” “To forget” means you don’t remember, an d if you don’t remember your girlfriend’s birthday, well, she won’t be your girl friend very long. Hugh says, “It” – meaning his girlfriend’s birthday, I believe – “was  last Tuesday and it completely slipped my mind.” For something “to slip (slip) you r mind” means to forget something or for something to be forgotten by accid ent. Of course, no one forgets something on purpose. “To slip your mind” i s just another way of saying “I forgot.”

Hugh says, “I forgot to put a reminder on my calend ar.” A “reminder” (reminder) is something that helps you remember about somethin g or remember to do something. Nowadays, with our electronic calendars,  you can put a reminder on your calendar and when that day comes up, you will get some sort of message on your phone or on your computer.

Hugh says that his girlfriend is “moping” (moping).  “To mope” means to show that you are very sad or unhappy, or perhaps disappointe d with someone or with something. “To mope” means to go around with a sad face and perhaps not be very interested in doing anything. Young children, when they’re angry at their parents, sometimes like to mope. They walk around t he house like the world has ended.

Hugh says his girlfriend is moping and giving him “ the silent treatment.” Oh, the silent treatment. “The silent treatment” is when so meone doesn’t talk to you, when someone refuses to talk to you – someone who w ould normally talk to you like, say, your girlfriend.

Gretchen asks, “What are you going to do to make up  for forgetting her birthday?” “To make up for” something is a phrasal verb meaning to do something nice for another person because you feel sorry for something you did – to try to improve a situation that is bad by doing something nice for the other person, especially when you did something wrong to that person.

Hugh says, “I’m just going to wait it out and let it blow over.” Hugh isn’t going to do anything, I guess, to make up for forgetting his  girlfriend’s birthday. Big mistake, Hugh. Hugh decides he’s going “to wait (wa it) it out (out).” “To wait it out” means to not do anything, hoping that the situ ation will get better. If you are at your house and it starts to rain and you want to  go somewhere but you think the rain will stop in a short amount of time, you w ill decide probably “to wait it out” – just to wait until the rain ends and then you wil l do what you wanted to do.

Hugh is going to wait it out with his girlfriend, h oping that she will no longer be angry with him in the future. That’s what he means by the expression “to let it blow (blow) over.” “To let something blow over” mea ns to wait until things become better or wait until a problem solves itself . I’m not sure. I’m guessing the expression, however, comes from the idea of a storm , with the big clouds in the sky eventually blowing over, meaning they will even tually leave and things will be better when it comes to the weather.

In any case, Hugh says that his girlfriend will “ge t over it.” “To get over it” means to no longer be bothered by something bad that has happened to you. Hugh is hoping his girlfriend will get over the fact that h e forgot her birthday. Now, you have to be careful with this expression in using it  with other people, especially using it as what we would call a “command form,” or  an “imperative.” It’s somewhat rude to say to someone, “Get over it.” Peo ple do say it, of course. What they mean is you should stop being sad or angr y and just not worry about that situation that is making you sad or angry.

Gretchen asks another question of Hugh. She says, “ Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?” “Belated” ( belated) means happening later than it should. If someone’s birthday was yesterday  and you don’t see that person until today, you might say, “Oh, a belated h appy birthday,” meaning it’s too late now. Your birthday has already passed, but  I’m still going to wish you a happy birthday. Anything that is “belated” is happe ning later than it should. So a “belated birthday present” or gift is giving someon e a gift after his birthday.

Hugh says, “I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her something really special then.” Hugh says he’s not going to buy his girlfriend a bi rthday present this year. Instead, he’s going to buy an even better birthday present next year. He’s going

“to double (double) up.” “To double up” means to do  twice as much as what you would normally do. Now, you see, that’s not the way  girlfriends work, Hugh. You can’t wait until next year. She’s not going to wait  for you, perhaps, if you do.

Gretchen says, “I don’t think it works that way,” a nd Gretchen, of course, is correct. She says, “She’s not going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be a sore spot.” Something that is “sore” (sore) is something that hurts or causes you pain. A “sore spot” could be an  area on your body that when you touch, it hurts, but here it’s used more genera lly or more metaphorically to mean something that hurts you emotionally or psycho logically. A “sore spot” would be a topic or an area or a subject that is up setting to you, that bothers you, that makes you upset.

Hugh says, “It’s not like I did something really bad that I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?” “To atone” (atone) me ans to do something to show that you are sorry, to try “to make up for,” going back to our previous phrasal verb, a bad situation. You try to do something that  will make things better – maybe you give someone a small gift in order “to at one for” criticizing that person unfairly last week. Hugh doesn’t think he did anyth ing really bad that he has to atone for. “What’s the big deal?” he asks, meaning “Why is this so important?”

Gretchen says, “Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .” The expression “You know best” (best) is used to show that you think the other person knows better than you about how to handle a situation. We often use it, however, in a way that shows that we don’t agree with the other person, an d that’s what Gretchen is doing here. She’s saying to Hugh, “You know best,” which you think would mean “You’re smarter than I am,” or “You know more than I do,” but in fact what she’s really saying is, “I disagree with you. I think you ’re wrong.”

She then says, “If I were her . . .” meaning “If I were your girlfriend, Hugh . . .” She doesn’t finish that sentence, but you know what  she means here is that she would be angry and probably not forgive Hugh. Hugh says, “You’re not her. I apologized,” Hugh says. “To apologize” (apologize) means to say that you are sorry for something you have done, something wrong that you have done.

Hugh continues, “Sooner or later, she’ll realize sh e’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apology.” The express ion “to blow (blow) something completely out of proportion (proportion) ” means to make something seem more important than it really is, especially a  problem – to make a problem seem as though it is more important than it really is. Hugh thinks that eventually his girlfriend will realize that she has blown this  completely out of proportion and that she should apologize to Hugh.

 Gretchen says, “Okay, if you say so.” “If you say s o” is another expression similar to “You know best,” that really means “You’re wrong . I disagree with you. I don’t think what you are saying is correct.” And here, th ose of us who have some experience in the world know that Gretchen is right  and Hugh is definitely wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gretchen: I thought you were going out with your gi rlfriend tonight. What are you doing here watching TV?

Hugh: She’s mad at me.

Gretchen: Why?

Hugh: I forgot her birthday. It was last Tuesday an d it completely slipped my mind. I forgot to put a reminder on my calendar. Sh e’s moping and giving me the silent treatment.

Gretchen: What are you going to do to make up for f orgetting her birthday?

Hugh: I’m just going wait it out and let it blow ov er. She’ll get over it.

Gretchen: Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?

Hugh: I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her someth ing really special then.

Gretchen: I don’t think it works that way. She’s no t going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be sore spot.

Hugh: It’s not like I did something really bad that  I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?

Gretchen: Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .

Hugh: You’re not her. I apologized. Sooner or later , she’ll realize she’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apo logy.

Gretchen: Okay, if you say so.

# Discovering a Minor Theft

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,284 – Discovering a Minor Theft.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,284. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Maria and the ow ner of a store about stealing something from the store. Sounds dangerous. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Maria: What’s going on here? I came as soon as I go t your phone call. Why are you holding onto my son like that?

Store Owner: I am restraining your son because I ca ught him shoplifting. I thought you’d like to be here when I called the pol ice.

Maria: There’s no need for that. He’s not a delinqu ent.

Store Owner: He is from my standpoint. Theft is a s erious crime.

Maria: I know it is and I’ll make restitution. Plea se give him a second chance. Please don’t call the police.

Store Owner: Well, it’s not the value of what he’s stolen that’s important. It’s the fact that he committed an offense.

Maria: Please let me pay for it and I’ll make sure he never enters your store again. What did he take and how much do I owe you?

Store Owner: I told you that it’s not the cost of t he item. It’s the principle.

Maria: What exactly did my son take?

Store Owner: He ate a grape.

Maria: One grape?

Store Owner: Yes, before I stopped him. He could ha ve eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.

Maria: All this is over one grape.

Store Owner: You should be thanking me for alerting  you to this behavior. As a parent, you know you need to nip these things in the bud. Today it’s a grape; tomorrow it’s a car!

Maria: [sigh] Okay, how much do I owe you for one g rape?

[end of dialogue]

Maria begins our dialogue by asking, “What’s going on here?” meaning “What is happening?” Maria continues, “I came as soon as I g ot your phone call.” So, someone has called Maria and Maria has traveled fro m her work or her home to this place. Well, it turns out we’re inside of a st ore in this dialogue. Maria then asks the person who owns the store, the person whos e store it is, “Why are you holding onto my son like that?” “To hold onto” some one means to put your arms or hands on someone so the person can’t leave, so h e doesn’t escape or go away from you.

The store owner says, “I am restraining your son be cause I caught him shoplifting.” “To restrain” (restrain) someone mean s to make it difficult or impossible for a person to move. The store owner is  holding on to this, I assume, child because the young man was caught “shoplifting .” “Shoplifting” (shoplifting) comes from the verb “to shoplift,” which means to s teal something from a store – usually a small item, something that isn’t worth a lot of money.

The store owner continues, “I thought you’d like to  be here when I called the police.” The shop owner is saying to the mother of this young man that he’s going to call the police and wanted the mother there when  he called. Maria says, “There’s no need for that,” meaning that isn’t nece ssary. “He’s not a delinquent.” A “delinquent” (delinquent) is a young person who c ommits a crime or who does things that are against the law. I was never a deli nquent, though I did know some people who were delinquents, who broke the law when  they were young.

The store owner says, “He is from my standpoint.” T he store owner is saying, “Actually, yes. Your son, Maria, is a delinquent.” He’s a delinquent from the store owner’s “standpoint” (standpoint). “Standpoint” is another word for viewpoint, or perspective. It describes the way that you view or understand a situation. The

store owner is saying, “Well, maybe you, Maria, don ’t think he’s a delinquent, but I think he’s a delinquent. Why? Well, because he st ole something.”

“Theft,” he continues, “is a serious crime.” “Theft ” (theft) is a noun meaning the crime of stealing things, the illegal act of taking  things that don’t belong to you. Maria says, “I know it is,” meaning yes, theft is a  serious crime. I agree. She says, “I’ll make restitution.” “To make restitution ” (restitution) means to return or pay for something that was stolen, or perhaps to ma ke up for something bad that you did to someone else by giving that person money  or by doing something else for that person.

Maria then says to the store owner, “Please give hi m a second chance,” meaning allow him another opportunity to do things right. “ Please don’t call the police,” she says. The store owner says, “Well, it’s not the val ue of what he’s stolen that’s important. It’s the fact that he committed an offen se.” “Value” (value) here refers to the price of what the young man stole. It’s how much money something is worth.

The store owner is not worried about how expensive the item that was stolen is, but rather the fact that this young boy committed a n offense. “To commit an offense” (offense) means to break a law – to do som ething that is against the rules of an organization or the laws of a certain p lace. It’s to commit a crime, in other words. Maria says, “Please let me pay for it and I’ll make sure he never enters your store again. What did he take and how m uch do I owe you?” she says. Maria is asking the store owner how much mone y she has to give the store owner to pay for what her son stole.

The store owner says, “I told you that it’s not the  cost of the item. It’s the principle.” The store owner is saying, “Well, the p rice isn’t important. It’s the principle” (principle). The “principle” is the beli ef or idea that guides your behavior, that tells you what to do. For example, y ou could have a principle of honesty that tells you never to lie, especially to your girlfriend or your wife or your mother. Of course, I hope you don’t lie to anyone.

Maria says, “What exactly did my son take?” The sto re owner responds, “He ate a grape.” A “grape” is a very small round or oval f ruit that is usually purple, red, or green. We make grapes into wine. We make wine from grapes, for example. It’s a very, very small thing, one grape. Maria is surpr ised. She says, “One grape?” The store owner says, “Yes, before I stopped him. H e could have eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.” The store owner is concerned that this young boy ate a single grape. He says, “Well, he co uld have eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.”

 A “fruit stand” (stand) is a small store, basically , that sells fruit, usually outside. It’s not something that is permanent. A fruit stand  is usually something that you can move from one place to another. This man owns a  fruit stand and thinks that this young boy was going to eat all of his fruit be cause he ate a single grape. He says, “He could have eaten the entire” – that is, a ll of the – “fruit stand” if he hadn’t been “vigilant” (vigilant). “To be vigilant”  means to be very careful about dangers or threats around you, to be watching very carefully to make sure nothing bad happens.

Maria is surprised – shocked, perhaps – by the stor e owner’s reaction. She says, “All this over one grape?” meaning the store owner caused all of this trouble just because her son ate a single grape. The store owner  says, “You should be thanking me for alerting you to this behavior.” “To  alert” (alert) someone is to make someone aware of something – to tell someone a bout something that the person might not have known about, especially if it ’s a danger or a problem.

The store owner says, “As a parent, you know you ne ed to nip these things in the bud.” The expression “to nip” (nip) something “in t he bud” (bud) means to solve a problem early, when it’s still a small problem, bef ore it becomes more serious or a bigger problem. For example, if someone at your w ork always comes in two minutes late, your boss might decide “to nip the pr oblem in the bud” just in case the person begins to come in 10 minutes late or 20 minutes late. You solve the problem when it’s still small. That’s what the stor e owner is suggesting Maria do for her son.

He says, “Today it’s a grape,” meaning today his cr ime is stealing a grape, “tomorrow it’s a car.” Maria then sighs – she makes  a sound indicating that she is perhaps not very happy with the store owner. She sa ys, “Okay, how much do I owe you for one grape” – how much money do I need t o give you to pay for the one grape that my son stole?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Maria: What’s going on here? I came as soon as I go t your phone call. Why are you holding onto my son like that?

Store Owner: I am restraining your son because I ca ught him shoplifting. I thought you’d like to be here when I called the pol ice.

# Types of Commendations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,285 – Types of Commendations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,285. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Marissa and Sant iago about types of commendations – rewards you give someone for doing a good job. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marissa: Can you believe it? We’ve received over 10 0 entries for the science fair.

Santiago: That’s great! We now need to decide what types of awards to hand out.

Marissa: Everybody likes money. How about a cash pr ize?

Santiago: We’re working with a very small budget he re. We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’m not sure that it would send the righ t message anyway.

Marissa: The next best thing is a trophy.

Santiago: We don’t have the budget for trophies if we plan to give out more than one commendation.

Marissa: Then how about medals?

Santiago: We can’t afford good ones and nobody want s a cheap plastic medal.

Marissa: So I guess plaques are out, too?

Santiago: I’m afraid so. I was thinking of ribbons,  different color ribbons for different prizes. What do you think?

Marissa: I guess ribbons would be okay. After all, it’s the praise and recognition that matters.

Santiago: Exactly. And for those getting honorable mentions, a certificate will do. We’ll also need certificates of participation for t he rest.

Marissa: So everybody gets something?

Santiago: That’s right. We don’t want anyone to lea ve empty-handed.

Marissa: Even if their entry isn’t worthy of recogn ition?

Santiago: All entries are worthy of recognition – j ust some more than others.

[end of dialogue]

Marissa begins by saying, “Can you believe it? We’v e received over 100 entries for the science fair.” Marissa starts by saying, “C an you believe it?” We usually use that expression when something surprising happe ns, something that is unusual. What is unusual, apparently, is that Maris sa and her school have received 100 entries for a science fair.

An “entry” (entry) is something usually that is giv en to someone in a competition so that other people can look at it or evaluate it.  Another word for “entry” would be a “submission” (submission). If you are having a n art contest, for example, and you want to find the best painter, you might as k each painter “to submit,” or to send in, a painting. That painting would be an e ntry in the competition.

This is a science fair competition. A “science fair ” (fair) is a competition that some schools or organizations have for students, usually  young students – students that are in grade school or high school. A “science  fair” involves experiments and other things that students put together to show the y understand scientific concepts. Marissa is happy that they have more than  100 of these student entries.

Santiago agrees. He says, “That’s great. We now nee d to decide what type of awards to hand out.” An “award” (award) is somethin g you give the winner of a competition or a game. The phrasal verb “to hand (h and) out” means to give to people, so if you are handing out awards, you are g iving people awards. If you’re handing out money, you are giving people money (and  you could give me some money if you’re handing out money).

Marissa says, “Everybody likes money,” meaning she thinks perhaps they should give the winners of this science fair cash. She eve n says, “How about a cash prize?” that is, a prize that is basically money. S antiago says, “We’re working

with a very small budget here,” which is another wa y of saying they don’t have a lot of money. “We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’ m not sure that would send the right message anyway.”

The expression “to send the right message” (message ) means to communicate to other people what you think is important, or per haps what you believe in. Giving kids money for doing well in a science fair might not send the right message. We don’t want them to think they should do  well in school just because they’ll get money, but of course they want to give the students something.

Marisa suggests that “the next best thing,” meaning  the next thing after money that would be good, “is a trophy” (trophy). A “trop hy” is an object that you give someone who wins an award – usually it is either a bowl or a cup, but it might also be a figure of a man or a woman that represent s victory. Here in Hollywood, the best movies and directors and actors will get a n Oscar. It’s a little trophy that represents their victory in a certain category for the Academy Awards, the awards given to the best movies and such every year .

Santiago says, “We don’t have the budget for trophi es.” Once again, to say you “don’t have the budget (budget) for” something mean s you don’t have enough money for something. Santiago says they don’t have the budget for trophies “if we plan to give out,” or hand out, “more than one c ommendation.” A “commendation” (commendation) is any kind of award or praise that you give to someone who has won a contest or a competition.

Marissa’s says, “Then how about medals?” A “medal” (medal) is a flat, often circular or round piece of metal (metal) that has w ords or images on it. It often looks like a little coin, and this round metal is t ypically worn on your shirt or jacket. Sometimes the medal is worn over your neck.  If you win a gold medal at the Olympics, you get a large round metal. Once aga in, you’ve probably seen these. They look like big coins that you wear aroun d your neck with a ribbon, a piece of fabric that is connected to the metal.

Santiago says, “We can’t afford good ones,” meaning  good-quality medals, “and nobody wants a cheap” – inexpensive, that is – “pla stic medal.” Marisa says, “So I guess plaques are out, too?” A “plaque” (plaque) is usually a square or, in any case, rectangular piece of wood or metal that has t he name of the contest and often the name of the winner on it. When Marissa sa ys, “plaques are out,” she means that plaques are not possible either. Santiag o says, “I’m afraid so,” meaning yes, plaques are out, too.

He then continues, “I was thinking of ribbons” (rib bons). A “ribbon” is a small rectangular piece of cloth, often with words on it – again, similar to a plaque except it’s made out of cloth and is much less expe nsive, much cheaper. Marissa says, “I guess ribbons would be okay. After all, it ’s the praise and recognition that matters.” Marissa is saying the actual prize is not  so important. It’s the “praise” – the saying of good things about you or whoever wins  – “and recognition that matters.”

“Recognition” is when someone says, “Yes, you did a  good job.” “Recognition” is any time that someone says, publicly, “You did a go od job” – or in this case, “You won this award.” It’s the praise and recognition th at is important. Santiago says, “Exactly.” Santiago continues, “And for those,” mea ning those students, “getting honorable mentions, a certificate will do.”

If you don’t win a prize at a school competition, y ou will sometimes be given an award that is called an “honorable mention.” An “ho norable mention” is given to anyone who does a good job in the contest but doesn ’t win it. Not all contests or competitions have honorable mentions, but some do, especially school competitions. A “certificate” (certificate) is a pi ece of paper that serves as an award or as a document showing that you’ve complete d something or won something.

Santiago also mentions “certificates of participati on.” “Certificates of participation” are given to anyone who is part of a competition or  a contest. Again, not all competitions or contests have certificates of parti cipation given to the people who participate or take part in those contests, but man y do, especially school competitions. Marissa says, “So everybody gets some thing?” Santiago says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “We don’t want anyone to leave empty- handed.”

The phrase “empty (empty) – handed (handed)” means without anything. If you leave “empty-handed,” you leave with nothing in you r hands – that is, you leave with nothing. You don’t get anything. “I went over to the beautiful woman to get her phone number but I left empty-handed,” meaning I didn’t get her phone number. Santiago doesn’t want any of the students t o leave empty-handed. Marissa says, “Even if their entry isn’t worthy of recognition?” “To be worthy” (worthy) means to be good enough to get something o r to be deserving something.

Santiago says, “All entries are worthy of recogniti on – just some more than others.” Santiago is saying that anyone who sends i n an entry or participates in this science fair deserves something, gets somethin g to recognize or to

acknowledge the participation of the student. Some,  however, are more worthy than others, meaning some deserve a prize more than  others. That’s why Santiago wants to give all of these different kinds  of prizes at different levels, I guess you could say.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marissa: Can you believe it? We’ve received over 10 0 entries for the science fair.

Santiago: That’s great! We now need to decide what types of awards to hand out.

Marissa: Everybody likes money. How about a cash pr ize?

Santiago: We’re working with a very small budget he re. We can’t afford a cash prize, and I’m not sure that it would send the righ t message anyway.

# Experiencing Headaches

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,286 – Experiencing Headaches.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,286. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Lupe and Eiji ab out having a headache. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lupe: Why are you lying on the couch with the light s out? Oh, you poor thing. Do you have a headache?

Eiji: Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.

Lupe: Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always  helps me when I have a pounding headache.

Eiji: No, I just want to lie here quietly.

Lupe: I know that when I have a tension headache, it always eases the pain when someone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that?

Eiji: No, I don’t think it’s a tension headache. It  came on suddenly.

Lupe: Then it’s not a sinus headache either? Are yo u feeling pain around your cheekbones?

Eiji: No, it’s not a sinus headache. I feel a littl e nauseous actually.

Lupe: Ah, then it must be a migraine. That explains  the dark room and the need for quiet. I know the perfect cure for a migraine.

Eiji: Me, too, but I don’t have it here.

Lupe: I’d be happy to get it for you.

Eiji: Great. The only place that stocks it is in the next town.

 Lupe: But that’s over two hours away.

Eiji: If it’s too much trouble . . .

Lupe: No, no, I’ll go. But how will you manage whil e I’m gone?

Eiji: I’ll just have to find a way to muddle throug h.

[end of dialogue]

The word “ache” (ache) means pain. So, a “headache”  is a pain that you have in your head, of course. Our dialogue is all about hea daches. Lupe begins by asking Eiji, “Why are you lying on the couch with t he lights out?” “To lie” (lie) means to put your body in what we would call a hori zontal position. When you sleep on a bed, you lie on the bed. Your body is no t standing up. It’s, we would say, “lying (lying) down.” Notice the spelling chan ges when it is turned into a participle (or “-ing”) form.

Eiji is lying on a “couch” or a “sofa” – a big thin g that two or more people can sit in. He has the “lights out,” meaning he’s turned the lights off in the room so that it’s dark. Lupe says, “Oh, you poor thing.” The phr ase “poor thing” is used to show sympathy or pity for another person who is in a bad or difficult situation. When you feel sorry for another person who is havin g a bad time, you might use that phrase, “Oh, you poor thing.” She says, “Do yo u have a headache?” Eiji says, “Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.”

The verb “to throb” (throb) means to have a very, i n this case, painful feeling that starts and stops regularly. Often when you have a b ad headache, you feel like your head is throbbing. It’s almost as though part of your head is like your heart. In fact, we use that verb “to throb” when describin g what a heart does. A “heart” is, of course, a muscle that is constantly moving. That motion, we could call a “throbbing motion.” It’s like something is going up  and down inside of your body. Well that’s the feeling of pain that Eiji is experi encing – a “throbbing pain” in his head.

Lupe says, “Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always helps me when I have a pounding headache.” The word “pounding” (pou nding) is the feeling, or we might say the sensation, of being hit repeatedly  – over and over again. Sometimes your headache feels like you’re being hit  in the head constantly. “Throbbing” and “pounding” are very closely related  in meaning here.

Eiji says, “No, I just want to lie here quietly.” L upe says, “I know that when I have a tension headache, it always eases the pain when s omeone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that?” Lupe describes  what helps her when she has a “tension (tension) headache.” “Tension” is a feeling often caused by stress, where your muscles are tight.

So, a “tension headache” is usually one that is cau sed by feeling stressed, or feeling anxious, or feeling nervous about something . Lupe says that it always “eases” (eases) the pain when someone “massages” (m assages) her neck and shoulders. “To ease” means to reduce pain or to get  rid of pain. A “massage” is when someone rubs your body, usually in an effort t o relax your muscles, to make them less tight. Eiji says he doesn’t want a m assage from Lupe. He says it’s not a tension headache.

“It came on suddenly,” he adds. When something “com es on,” it begins very quickly or without warning. When we say a headache “came on suddenly,” we mean it appears to have started instantly. It wasn’ t a small headache that grew into a big headache. It was a big headache right aw ay. Lupe says, “Then it’s not a sinus headache either?” A “sinus (sinus) headache ” is a headache caused by pain in, of course, your sinuses. Your sinuses are in your head. They’re connected to, or part of, your breathing that is do ne through your nose.

Sometimes when we have a cold or our sinuses become  infected, it’s difficult to breathe, but also it causes pain in our head. Lupe says, “Are you feeling pain around your cheekbones?” Your “cheeks” (cheeks) are  the parts of your face that are located on either side of your nose. Your “chee kbones,” then, are the bones that are on that part of your face below your eyes,  on either side of your nose.

Eiji says, “No, it’s not a sinus headache.” He adds , “I feel a little nauseous actually.” “Nauseous” (nauseous) is an adjective th at describes a feeling in your stomach that you’re going to be sick – that you’re going to, we would say, “throw up” or “vomit.” “To vomit” is when the contents of your stomach, what’s in your stomach, comes out through your mouth – not a very nice feeling.

Lupe says, “Ah, then it must be a migraine (migrain e).” A “migraine,” or “migraine headache,” is a very severe, a very intense headach e that causes a lot of pain. Sometimes it can also cause “nausea” – that is, tha t feeling of being sick in your stomach – as well as problems with your vision. You  can’t see properly. Not all migraines, however, have those symptoms or those th ings that are associated with it.

Lupe says, “That explains the dark room and the nee d for quiet.” People who get migraine headaches often are able to ease their pai n by lying down and turning off the lights. “I know the perfect cure for a migr aine,” Lupe says. A “cure” (cure) is something that helps a medical problem; usually it’s something that makes the medical problem – the sickness, the disease, the il lness – go away. Some of you old enough might remember a rock band called the Cu re that was popular in the ’80s and ’90s – the old days.

Anyway. Lupe thinks she has the perfect cure for a migraine. Eiji says, “Me, too,” meaning I also know what the perfect cure is. “But, ” he adds, “I don’t have it here.” We get the feeling right now that perhaps Ei ji is just trying to get rid of Lupe. He wants Lupe to leave him alone. Lupe says, “I’d be happy to get it for you.” Eiji says, “Great. The only place that stocks  it is in the next town.

“To stock” something means for a store to have some thing available to sell you. That’s why we sometimes use the expressions “in sto ck” and “out of stock.” If you go to a store to buy say a pair of shoes and the st ore says, “We don’t have that kind in stock,” they mean they don’t actually have any of those shoes there at their store. They are, we might also say, “out of s tock.” “To be out of stock” means you don’t have it. “To be in stock” means you  do have it.

Eiji says the only place that stocks this drug, we’ re guessing, is in the next town, meaning not in the town or small city where they are right now, but in one that is close to them, perhaps 10 miles or 20 miles or even  farther away. Lupe says, “But that’s over two hours away,” meaning the next town is two hours from where they are now.

I must say that is a little unlikely if they’re in the main part of the United States. Most towns have another town within, oh, 10 or 20 m iles. That’s because when the country was first getting started, that’s about  how long you could go in a single day – but perhaps they’re located in Alaska.  I don’t know. Alaska is a big state located, of course, between Canada and Russia , that is part of the U.S. that doesn’t have very many towns or people in it.

Eiji wants Lupe to go get him this medicine. Eiji s ays, however, “If it’s too much trouble” – meaning, well, if it is too much work or  involves too much time for Lupe, she doesn’t have to do it – but you can tell by the way he says it that he really wants Lupe to leave, to go to this town.

Lupe then agrees. She says, “No, no, I’ll go.” She’ s saying, “No, it is not too much trouble. I’ll go to this town.” Then she asks,  “But how will you manage while I’m gone?” The verb “to manage” (manage) has a lot of different uses in

conversational English. Here it means to be able to  do something that is difficult, to be able to survive through a difficult situation .

Eiji says, “I’ll just have to find a way to muddle through.” In other words, “I’ll have to find a way to muddle through while you are gone,  without your help.” The phrasal verb “to muddle (muddle) through” something  means to be able to do something that is difficult even when you don’t hav e the necessary experience, education, or skills to do it. It means to be able to do something, but probably not do it very well.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lupe: Why are you lying on the couch with the light s out? Oh, you poor thing. Do you have a headache?

Eiji: Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.

Lupe: Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always  helps me when I have a pounding headache.

Eiji: No, I just want to lie here quietly.

Lupe: I know that when I have a tension headache, it always eases the pain when someone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that?

Eiji: No, I don’t think it’s a tension headache. It  came on suddenly.

Lupe: Then it’s not a sinus headache either? Are yo u feeling pain around your cheekbones?

Eiji: No, it’s not a sinus headache. I feel a littl e nauseous actually.

Lupe: Ah, then it must be a migraine. That explains  the dark room and the need for quiet. I know the perfect cure for a migraine.

Eiji: Me, too, but I don’t have it here.

Lupe: I’d be happy to get it for you.

Eiji: Great. The only place that stocks it is in the next town.

 Lupe: But that’s over two hours away.

Eiji: If it’s too much trouble . . .

Lupe: No, no, I’ll go. But how will you manage whil e I’m gone?

Eiji: I’ll just have to find a way to muddle throug h.

# Using Adapters and Converters

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,287 – Using Adapters and Converters.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,287. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Ben and Nicola a bout being able to plug in or use your electronic devices when you’re in another country or when you’re traveling. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ben: Wait! Don’t plug that into the socket. You’ll fry that old hair dryer.

Nicola: I can’t, anyway. This plug has two prongs a nd that socket is designed for three prongs.

Ben: That’s why I brought these adapters and this c ombination converter and transformer. Our devices will either not work or be  ruined if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.

Nicola: I should have bought a travel hair dryer wi th dual voltage.

Ben: You’d still need an adapter.

Nicola: Whatever. Okay, I’ve put them both on. Now can I dry my hair?

Ben: You can’t use that hair dryer because the cord  is frayed. If you turn it on, it may short circuit and then blow a fuse. We’d be wit hout electricity.

Nicola: What am I supposed to do then?

Ben: Good thing I brought mine. Let me just check t hat the outlet is grounded. Yeah, I think it’s safe for you to use this one.

Nicola: I won’t get electrocuted?

Ben: You won’t even get a little singed.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ben saying to Nicola, “Wai t,” meaning “Stop what you are doing.” He then says, “Don’t plug that into the  socket.” The phrasal verb “to plug (plug) in” something or “to plug something in”  – and we can also use “into” (into) with this verb – means to put the wire that is connected to an electronic device into what is called a “socket.”

Technically you’re not putting the wires into the s ocket. You’re putting something the wires are connected to, called a “plug” (plug).  So “plug” is both a noun, describing that object that is at the end of an ele ctrical wire, and a verb meaning to put that object into a “socket” (socket). A “soc ket,” sometimes called a “wall socket,” is that thing in the wall that has electri city running to it. You put, or plug, something into the socket in order to get electrici ty to your T.V. or radio or phone charger or whatever it happens to be.

So, Ben is telling Nicola not to plug something int o a socket. He then says, “You’ll fry that old hair dryer.” The verb “to fry” (fry) h ere means to destroy something or ruin something, especially an electronic device, be cause of an inappropriate or improper amount of electricity used with it. Americ ans who travel to Europe, for example, have to be careful because most European c ountries use a different system of electricity. Here in the United States we  use 110 volts, and in many countries in Europe they use 220 volts.

Well, some older electronic devices don’t work on b oth systems. My electric toothbrush, for example, got fried when I plugged it in once when I was visiting Europe several years ago. It wasn’t one that you co uld use with the different voltage that was used in that country. So, that’s w hat we mean by “to fry” something. It means the electronic device stops wor king because it has the wrong amount of electricity or type going through it. A “hair (hair) dryer (dryer)” does what it says it does. It dries your hair. I us ed to have a hair dryer.

Nicola says, “I can’t, anyway,” meaning “I can’t pl ug in to this socket.” She says, “This plug has two prongs and that socket is design ed for three prongs.” A “prong” (prong) is one of those short pieces of met al that comes out of a plug that is used to connect the plug to the socket. In the U nited States, most sockets accept plugs that have two short, flat pieces of me tal. In many other countries the prongs are round, and therefore if you want to plug  something, say, from the United States into another socket in another countr y, you need what’s called an “adapter.”

And that’s what Ben talks about in the very next se ntence here. He says, “That’s why I brought these adapters.” An “adapter” (adapte r) is any small device that connects two things together that use different sys tems of connectors. So, for example, you may have a phone that uses one kind of  connector on one end of the electric cord used to charge the phone and a di fferent connector on the other end. If you need to connect two things together tha t have different connectors, you need an “adapter.”

For electronic devices, you may need something that  not only helps with the two different systems of prongs, but also with the actu al type of or amount of electricity. Ben refers to a “combination converter ” and “transformer.” A “converter” is anything that changes the electrical  current, such as from AC, or “alternating current,” to DC, or “direct current.” A “transformer” is something that changes the amount of voltage of the electric curre nt from, say, 220, which is used commonly in Europe, to 110, which is used for U.S. and Canadian electronic devices – and other countries as well, of course.

Nowadays, many electronic devices have their own co nverters and/or transformers built in so that you don’t need a sepa rate one, but older ones often do need converters and/or transformers. Ben continu es, “Our devices will either not work or will be ruined” – that is, will be dest royed – “if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.” An “outlet” (outlet) here means the same thing as a wall socket.

Nicola says, “I should have bought a travel hair dr yer with dual voltage.” “Dual” (dual) means two, or two types. So “dual voltage” i s something that works on both 110- and 220-volt electrical systems. Ben says , however, “You’d still need an adapter,” meaning even if the hair dryer was one  that had dual voltage, you still wouldn’t be able to plug it into the socket b ecause the prongs wouldn’t fit into a different socket. You would need an adapter for t hat to convert it from, say, a U.S.-style plug to one that would work in different  countries.

Nicola says, “Whatever,” meaning “Okay, I don’t wan t to talk about that anymore.” She says, “I’ve put them both on,” meanin g she has put the plug into an adapter and a transformer. “Now can I dry my hai r?” she asks. Ben says, “You can’t use that hair dryer because the cord is fraye d” (frayed). If something is “frayed,” it is coming apart. We especially use tha t for a rope or wire that has been used so much that it is starting to come apart . You can see the inside of the cord where the wire itself is. Whatever is around t hat wire is starting to fray, or to come apart.

Notice that Ben says the “cord” (cord) is frayed. T he cord is what goes between your electronic device and the socket. It’s what the plug is connected to. The cord has the wires in it that connect your device t o the socket. Ben says, “If you turn it on,” meaning if you turn that hair dryer on , “it may short circuit and then blow a fuse.” “To short circuit” (circuit) is when the electrical current starts to increase rapidly due to a problem with your wires, with your cord, or perhaps with the device itself. This can cause a fire and/or dam age your electrical device.

A “short circuit” can also cause you to “blow a fus e” (fuse). “To blow a fuse” means that there is too much power running and the electrical system shuts down. It stops. One of the safety devices that hous es and buildings have are what are called “fuses” (fuses) or nowadays, much m ore commonly, “circuit breakers.” What happens is that the electrical powe r stops going to a certain part of the house or building when too much power is bei ng drawn, when too much power is going through the wires.

In most modern buildings and houses, there are what  are called “circuit breakers.” There’s just a little switch that you ha ve to turn back on. In the old days, including in the house I grew up in many year s ago, we had what were called “fuses.” Inside of the fuse, which was basic ally a little cylinder, a little round tube, there was a wire that itself would brea k apart when too much power was going through it. In any case, Ben says that if  Nicola had a short circuit, they would end up being without electricity. Nicola says , “What am I supposed to do then?”

Ben says, “Good thing I brought mine,” meaning he b rought his own hair dryer. “Let me just check” – let me just see – “that the o utlet is grounded (grounded).” “To be grounded” means that there is an electrical wire that runs or goes from the plug to the ground so that it can take away any ext ra electrical charges in the case of a large amount of electricity going through  the wire, such as a short circuit or possibly a lightning strike – when a lar ge amount of electricity is running through the air and eventually the wire during a bad storm.

Ben says, “Yeah, I think it’s safe for you to use t his one.” Nicola says, “I won’t get electrocuted?” “To be electrocuted” (electrocuted) means to be hurt or even killed by having electricity go through your body. This ca n happen accidentally, of course. In some places, they kill people by electro cuting them when they have committed some sort of crime.

Ben says, “You won’t even get a little singed” (sin ged). “To be singed” means to be burnt a little bit. If you have long hair and are close to a fire, your hair might

start to burn. If you put it out quickly, it would get a little “singed.” It would get burnt, but not completely. I, fortunately, don’t ha ve to worry about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ben: Wait! Don’t plug that into the socket. You’ll fry that old hair dryer.

Nicola: I can’t, anyway. This plug has two prongs a nd that socket is designed for three prongs.

Ben: That’s why I brought these adapters and this c ombination converter and transformer. Our devices will either not work or be  ruined if we try plugging them directly into those outlets.

# Being a Job-Hopper

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,288 – Being a Job-Hopper.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,288. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Simon and Maggie  about a person who doesn’t work at one job for very long. Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Simon: Hey Maggie, I just stopped by to say good-by e. This is my last week.

Maggie: What? You’re leaving? You’re not being fire d, are you?

Simon: No, I have another job lined up. It’s with a  bigger company.

Maggie: But you’ve worked here for less than a year . You’re quitting?

Simon: Yeah, I’ve been putting out feelers for the past couple of months. I’m ready for a change.

Maggie: Are you sure this is the right move? You do n’t want to be labeled as a job-hopper.

Simon: I appreciate your concern, but I’m not a lif er, that’s for sure.

Maggie: But you’ve moved three times in the past th ree years. Aren’t you afraid of being considered unstable or disloyal? It’s normally considered career suicide to move from job to job.

Simon: I know that some people spend 20 years in the same company, climbing the corporate ladder and working toward their pensi on, but that’s just not me.

Maggie: Aren’t you afraid companies won’t invest in  you because they’re afraid you’ll jump ship?

Simon: Nope. It hasn’t happened yet.

Maggie: Well, then I wish you all the best. Maybe I ’ll cross paths with you again in your twentieth or thirtieth job.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about a “job-hopper” (hopper). A “j ob-hopper” is someone who moves jobs frequently, who doesn’t stay at any one job for a very long time. Simon begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey Maggie, I  just stopped by to say good-bye.” The phrasal verb “to stop by” (by) means  to visit somewhere or to go somewhere for a very short time, usually for an inf ormal visit with someone. “I’m going to stop by at my brother’s house on my way to  work just to say hello.”

Often we use this phrasal verb when we aren’t plann ing on doing something in advance, but decide perhaps at the last minute or o n very short notice to do something. That’s not always the way this phrasal v erb is used, however. It could be something that we also planned. You could say, “ I’m going to stop by the grocery store to buy some milk on my way to my brot her’s house.” So, “to stop by” can also be used when we are going to stop or g o more than one place before we reach our destination, before we go to the final place we are planning on going.

Simon is saying good-bye to Maggie because this is his “last week” – his last week of work. Maggie is surprised. She says, “You’r e not being fired, are you?” “To be fired” (fired) means to lose your job becaus e your boss or your company says you can no longer work there. There are two wa ys to stop working somewhere. One is to “quit” (quit), which is when y ou decide that you don’t want to work at a place. The other way to end your emplo yment is “to be fired.” That’s when your company says, “We don’t want you working here anymore.”

Simon is not being fired. He says, “I have another job lined up.” “To be lined (lined) up” means to be ready to use or waiting for  you to use. In this case, it means that Simon has another job that he is going t o move to. He says this other job is with a bigger, a larger, company. Maggie say s, “But you’ve worked here for less than a year. You’re quitting?”

Simon says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “I’ve been putting  out feelers for the past couple of months,” he says. The phrase “to put out feelers” (feelers) means to ask other people or to tell other people about some thing that you have that you think they may want, to see if they are interested.  “To put out feelers” means to determine whether other people, in this case, are i nterested in giving you a job.

You may mention to your friend who works at another  company, for example, that you are interested in leaving your company. Yo u want to find out if your friend’s company may be interested in hiring you – that is, in giving you a job. That would be an example of “putting out feelers.” You don’t necessarily go to the company directly, but you tell people about your si tuation to see if someone may be interested in hiring you.

Simon says he’s ready for a change. Maggie asks, “A re you sure this is the right move?” meaning this is the correct decision or the right thing to do. “You don’t want to be labeled as a job-hopper,” she says. “To be labeled” (labeled) as something means to be seen in a certain way, especi ally something that perhaps you don’t want to be seen as. If you are labeled as  a lazy person, that means people think you are lazy, and of course you don’t want people to think you are lazy, normally.

Maggie is concerned that Simon will be considered o r labeled as a “job-hopper,” someone who doesn’t stay at a job very long. Many p eople think this is a bad thing, that a person who is considered a job-hopper  will have difficulty finding jobs because no one will want to hire that person k nowing the person will leave in a few months, say. Simon says, “I appreciate your c oncern,” meaning I thank you for being worried about me, “but I’m not a lifer, t hat’s for sure.” The term “lifer” (lifer) refers to a person who works for one compan y his entire career or his entire life. Simon says he’s not a lifer.

Maggie says, “But you’ve moved three times in the p ast three years,” meaning he’s had three different jobs in three years. “Aren ’t you afraid of being considered unstable or disloyal?” “To be unstable” (unstable) means to be not stable. That prefix “un” means “not,” usually. “To be not stable ” means that you aren’t reliable. You are not dependable. You’re not steady or consis tent. If someone is “unstable,” someone may change next week or a month  from now. “To be disloyal” (disloyal) means to be not loyal. The pre fix “dis” is often used like the prefix “un” to mean “not.”

So if you are “disloyal,” you are not loyal. “To be  loyal” means to be committed to a person, to defend a person, or to stay with that person – or in this case, a company – for a long time. Maggie is saying that Si mon will be considered disloyal if he continues to job-hop. “It’s normally  considered career suicide to move from job to job,” she says. “Career” (career) refers to your job history or your work life, what you do to make money. “Suicide ” (suicide) normally means to kill yourself. “Career suicide,” then, is a phrase that means to ruin your chances of having a good career, of having good jobs.

Simon says, “I know that some people spend 20 years  in the same company, climbing the corporate ladder and working toward th eir pension, but that’s just not me.” The expression “to climb (climb) the corporate  (corporate) ladder (ladder)” means to work in a single company, going from one j ob to the next, each time getting a better job, but doing it slowly.

So you begin in one job, and then you get another j ob in the same company that is better paying and has more responsibility, and t hen you get another job a few years later in the same company, higher up in the c ompany. That would be “climbing the corporate ladder.” A “pension” (pensi on) is money that the company gives you after you retire, money that you will liv e on after you retire. Maggie says, “Aren’t you afraid companies won’t invest in you because they’re afraid you’ll jump ship?”

“To invest” (invest) in a person, in someone, means  to spend money and time on a person, perhaps giving that person more skills or  training so that that person will be a better employee, a better worker for you.  Maggie is saying that if companies think he’s not going to stay very long, t hey won’t invest in him. They won’t give him a lot of extra training. They’ll be afraid that he will “jump (jump) ship (ship).” The expression “to jump ship” means t o leave a company or an organization and move to a different one, often whe n the company is having a difficult time.

If you can imagine a ship out on the ocean, a large  boat, and the boat is beginning to sink, beginning to go down into the wa ter, the first thing you would want to do is jump to another ship. You would want to move to another ship that was not sinking. A person who moves from a failing company, from a company that doesn’t seem to be doing very well, to a more successful company could be said to be “jumping ship” – to be moving to the bet ter company. Simon is not afraid that companies will be afraid to invest in h im. He says, “It hasn’t happened yet.”

Maggie says, “Well, then I wish you all the best,” meaning good luck. “Maybe I’ll cross paths with you again in your twentieth or thi rtieth job.” Maggie is making a joke, saying that Simon may end up having twenty or  thirty jobs if he keeps moving all the time. She says, “Maybe I’ll cross pa ths with you.” “To cross (cross) paths (paths)” means to meet someone in the future by chance, by luck, not by planning it. If you tell someone, “Perhaps our path s will cross in the future someday,” you mean “Maybe someday you and I will se e each other again even when we don’t plan on it.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Simon: Hey Maggie, I just stopped by to say good-by e. This is my last week.

Maggie: What? You’re leaving? You’re not being fire d, are you?

Simon: No, I have another job lined up. It’s with a  bigger company.

Maggie: But you’ve worked here for less than a year . You’re quitting?

# Problems With Drinking Water

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,289 – Problems with Drinking Water.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,289. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. This episode is a dialogue between Yulia and Jack about drinking water – and the water you shoul dn’t drink. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yulia: Wait! Don’t drink that.

Jack: Why not? I’m really thirsty.

Yulia: That’s a standing pool of water. There could  be all kinds of microorganisms living in there.

Jack: Fine, but somebody should have brought more w ater for this long walk.

Yulia: I know. It’s my fault. Hey, there’s a cabin.  Maybe there’s somebody there who can give us some water. Do you see a well?

Jack: No, no well, and I don’t see an outdoor fauce t either. In fact, I don’t see any signs of life inside. But hey, the door is unlocked .

Yulia: Are you sure we should just walk in?

Jack: I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re a fraid to go in. Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap. Let’s see if there are any wa ter tanks or rain barrels out back.

Yulia: I’m not drinking rainwater or runoff from the roof.

Jack: Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of water.

Yulia: Wait! You don’t know if that’s potable. It c ould be untreated water with sewage or worse.

Jack: You can wait for some nice filtered water, bu t I’m not picky. I just need to quench my thirst.

Yulia: You should at least boil it first. Oh my God , I just saw something swimming in it!

Jack: I’m sure it’s willing to share.

[end of dialogue]

Yulia says to Jack, “Wait! Don’t drink that.” Jack says, “Why not? I’m really thirsty.” “To be thirsty” (thirsty) means to really  want to drink something, such as water or some other beverage, something else that o ne normally drinks. Yulia says, “That’s a standing pool of water.” A “standin g pool (pool) of water” is a small area or a small “body,” we would call it, of water that is not moving. Usually we’re talking about something that is only perhaps three or, at most, four feet around that doesn’t have a lot of water in it. It c ould be larger than that, I suppose.

Another word we might use here for a very small amo unt of water that you see on the ground is “puddle” (puddle). If you are walk ing along the street or down an area and you see water on the ground where there is  a small depression or hole in the ground, we would call that a “puddle,” becau se there isn’t any water moving in or out of it. We might refer to it as a “ standing pool of water.”

Yulia says, “There could be all kinds of microorgan isms living in there.” A “microorganism” (microorganism) is a very small for m of life that cannot be seen by your eyes unless you use what’s called a “micros cope” – a special device that allows you to see things that are very, very small.  Jack says, “Fine,” meaning okay, “but somebody should have brought more water for this long walk.”

We now understand what’s going on here. Jack and Yu lia have gone for some sort of walk, probably away from the city, and they  don’t have enough water. Jack is thirsty and is looking for something to dri nk. Yulia says, “I know. It’s my fault,” meaning “I am the one who is responsible for not bringing enough water.” Then she says, “Hey, there’s a cabin” (cabin).

A “cabin” is a small house that you would find out away from the city, perhaps next to a lake or up in the mountains or out where there isn’t anyone else around. A cabin is often a place where people go on vacatio n, nowadays, to get away from the city. “Maybe there’s somebody there who ca n give us some water,” Yulia says. “Do you see a well?” A “well” (well) is  a very deep hole in the ground

that is created in order to find water. The word “w ell,” of course, is also an adverb in English, but as a noun it refers to a deep hole from which you get water.

Jack says, “No, no well,” meaning no, there is not a well here. He continues, “I don’t see an outdoor faucet either.” “Outdoor” (out door) means outside of a house or a building. The opposite of “outdoor” is, of course, “indoor” (indoor). A “faucet” (faucet) is the metal device that you get water from, usually in a sink. “In fact,” Jack says, “I don’t see any signs of life in side,” meaning he doesn’t think there is anyone inside of the cabin. “But hey, the door is unlocked,” meaning whoever owns this cabin has not locked the door.

Yulia says, “Are you sure we should just walk in?” Are you sure we should go into this cabin? Because, after all, it isn’t their cabi n. Jack responds, “I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re afraid to go in.” He mea ns “I’m not going to die here in the middle of nowhere just because the owner of the  cabin isn’t there.” He’s going to go in, even though it doesn’t belong to hi m, to see if he can find some water.

Then he says, “Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap”  (tap). The “tap” is another word for the faucet. It’s where you get water from in a sink. Normally you can turn a tap on, and when you do, the water comes out of t he tap. But when Jack turns the tap on, nothing comes out, meaning there is no water there.

Then he says, “Let’s see if there are any water tan ks or rain barrels out back.” A “water tank” (tank) is a large container that is us ed to put water in. Sometimes, if you live away from the city, you may have your wate r in a big tank. My parents used to have a small cabin up in the northern part of Minnesota near a lake, and we had a water tank where the water was kept so tha t we could have water to drink and cook and so forth.

A “rain barrel” (barrel) is a large container that collects the water from a rainfall. If you live away from the city and you need water, you  might have a rain barrel that collects rain as it comes down. It stores the water  in the barrel so you can use it later, often to do things such as give water to pla nts and so forth.

Yulia says, “I’m not drinking rain water or runoff from the roof.” Jack proposes they look for a rain barrel or a water tank in the back of the cabin, but Yulia says, “No, I’m not going to drink rainwater” – that is, t he water that comes from the sky as rain. She is also not going to drink any “runoff ” (runoff). “Runoff” is water that usually has gone over some surface such as the roof  of a house.

If you have rain on your house, the water probably goes somewhere. It doesn’t stay on the top of your house. Well, we would call that water “runoff” because it has come from some other surface or gone over some other surface. It has “drained,” we would say, away from your roof. You c ould also have runoff from a street or a road. “Runoff” is usually water coming from a rainstorm, but not always. It could be from some other machine or sour ce of liquid.

Jack says, “Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of wate r.” “Suit (suit) yourself,” means “That’s fine – you can make your own decisions for you, but I’m going to do something different.” He says, “Here’s a tub (tub) of water.” A “tub” is normally something we use to bathe in. You can get yourself clean with soap and water in a bathtub. The word “tub” can refer to any large co ntainer used for either bathing, that is getting your body clean, or washing, such a s washing your clothes.

Yulia says, “Wait! You don’t know if that’s” – mean ing the water in the tub – “if that’s potable” (potable). “Potable” means somethin g you can drink, something that is safe to drink. Not all water, of course, is  safe to drink for humans. Yulia says that that water “could be untreated water with  sewage or worse.” “Untreated” means that it isn’t clean. It hasn’t be en prepared for humans to drink. “Sewage” (sewage) is what we call wastewater. It’s any sort of water or liquid that has something dirty in it, including things that co me out of your body, if you know what I mean.

Jack says, “You can wait for some nice filtered wat er, but I’m not picky.” “Filtered (filtered) water” is water that has been cleaned. W e would say it is water that has been “purified.” You’ve gotten rid of all the bad t hings that might make you sick in the water. Jack says he’s not “picky” (picky). “To be picky” means to be very selective about what you eat or drink, or what you will accept. “Oh, I don’t want any of that; I don’t want any of that; I don’t want  any of that; I only want this.” That’s being “picky” – when you only want certain t hings or are only happy with certain things.

Jack says, “I just need to quench my thirst.” “To q uench (quench) your thirst (thirst)” means to drink something so that you are no longer thirsty. You no longer have a strong desire to drink. Yulia says, “You sho uld at least boil it first.” Yulia is telling Jack he should “boil” (boil) the water. “To  boil” water or any other liquid means to bring it to a temperature that causes litt le bubbles, little bits of air to come out of the liquid – to bring it, that is, to w hat we would call a “gaseous state.”

In Fahrenheit, 212 degrees is the temperature at wh ich water will boil, although that depends exactly on how high up in the air you are. Here in Los Angeles,

we’re basically at sea level, so 212 degrees Fahren heit is about right. That would be 100 degrees Celsius for the rest of the world. Y ulia thinks that Jack should boil the water. Then she says, “I just saw somethin g swimming in it” – that is, she saw some little animal, perhaps a little fish even,  swimming in the water.

Jack isn’t concerned. He says, “I’m sure it’s willi ng to share,” meaning “I’m sure this little animal will let me have some water as w ell.” He’s obviously not concerned about getting sick from what appears to b e unclean water.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yulia: Wait! Don’t drink that.

Jack: Why not? I’m really thirsty.

Yulia: That’s a standing pool of water. There could  be all kinds of microorganisms living in there.

Jack: Fine, but somebody should have brought more w ater for this long walk.

Yulia: I know. It’s my fault. Hey, there’s a cabin.  Maybe there’s somebody there who can give us some water. Do you see a well?

Jack: No, no well, and I don’t see an outdoor fauce t either. In fact, I don’t see any signs of life inside. But hey, the door is unlocked .

Yulia: Are you sure we should just walk in?

Jack: I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re a fraid to go in. Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap. Let’s see if there are any wa ter tanks or rain barrels out back.

Yulia: I’m not drinking rainwater or runoff from the roof.

Jack: Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of water.

Yulia: Wait! You don’t know if that’s potable. It c ould be untreated water with sewage or worse.

 Jack: You can wait for some nice filtered water, bu t I’m not picky. I just need to quench my thirst.

Yulia: You should at least boil it first. Oh my God , I just saw something swimming in it!

Jack: I’m sure it’s willing to share.

# Describing Car Speed and Power

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,290 – Describing Car Speed and Power.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,290. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Martin and his f riend Asta about the speed and power of a car. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: Did you see that? It’s the new McQ. It does  0 to 60 in four seconds. It has amazing performance.

Asta: That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the color .

Martin: Color?! Who cares about the color? The McQ is supposed to top out at 155, but it’s been clocked at 160. Can you imagine?

Asta: No, I can’t.

Martin: It has more horsepower than any car on the market and amazing torque. You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.

Asta: So it can go fast?

Martin: Yeah, it can go fast. It’s supposed to be r eally responsive, too, and the reviews say that the acceleration is really smooth.  I bet that’s because of the tuning.

Asta: I like cars with more trunk space.

Martin: You don’t drive a car like the McQ for its storage capacity. You drive it for speed.

Asta: My cousin doesn’t like it that much. He says it doesn’t have enough legroom.

 Martin: What?! Your cousin owns a McQ?

Asta: Yes, but he only drives it when his Ediger is  in the shop.

Martin: How is it possible that I’ve known you for years and this is the first time you’ve mentioned this cousin to me? You know that I ’m the biggest car enthusiast in the world, don’t you?

Asta: My cousin isn’t in town very often. He’s usua lly traveling to races.

Martin: Your cousin is a race car driver?

Asta: Yes, didn’t I mention that either?

[end of dialogue]

Martin begins our dialogue by asking Asta, “Did you  see that? It’s the McQ. It does 0 to 60 in four seconds.” “0” and “60” here re fer to miles per hour – as in the speed, in this case, of a car. So, if a car “does,”  or goes, “0 to 60 in four seconds,” it can go from 0 – that is, from not movi ng at all – to 60 miles per hour as a speed in four seconds.

In American television ads, or advertisements, for cars, you often hear the term “0 to 60” to describe how fast a car can accelerate , how fast it can speed up. The shorter the time it takes to go from 0 to 60, suppo sedly the better the car engine or motor – the part of the car that makes it move.

Martin says this car, which is called the McQ – no relation to me – has “amazing performance.” “Performance” (performance) refers to  how well something works. You could talk about a person’s “performance” on the job. Their “job performance” would be how well they work at this pa rticular job or in this position. The performance of a car refers to how well it driv es, how fast it goes, how reliable it is, and so forth.

Asta says, “That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the  color.” Martin is talking about the performance of the car, but Asta refers to its colo r. She’s not interested in how well the car runs. She’s interested in how the car looks. Martin is surprised, because of course he doesn’t care about the color of the car.

In fact, he says, “Who cares about the color? The M cQ,” meaning this car named McQ, “is supposed to top out at 155.” “To top (top)  out” means to reach the

highest value of something, or to reach what we mig ht call the “upper (upper) limit” of something. “To top out” in the case of a car would mean the fastest it can go, the highest speed it can go. In this case, it’s  155 miles per hour, which is pretty fast. That would be about 250 kilometers per  hour for those of you who use kilometers, which is most of you.

Martin says that the car is “supposed to top out at  155,” meaning perhaps that’s what the car company says. “But,” he adds, “it’s be en clocked at 160.” “To be clocked (clocked) at” means to be recorded at a par ticular speed or to be proven by someone else measuring the speed to be actually faster. So, if the car has been “clocked at 160,” someone has actually driven the car and measured its speed and found out that it can actually go faster than 155 miles per hour; it can go 160.

Martin then asks Asta, “Can you imagine?” That ques tion, “Can you imagine?” is used when we are surprised by something, and we are  indicating to someone else how surprising that is. For example, let’s say  you go to work and your boss comes in drunk, having drunk too much alcohol that morning – because you know, you can’t drink too much alcohol before you g o to work, just a little bit. Well, you may say to your friend, “My boss came in drunk today. Can you imagine?” You are indicating how surprised you are that your boss came in drunk today.

Asta responds to Martin’s statement “Can you imagin e?” – his question – by saying, “No, I can’t,” meaning “I can’t imagine.” S he’s also indicating by her response that perhaps she isn’t very interested in the same thing Martin is. Martin continues, however, “It” – meaning the McQ, the car – “has more horsepower then any car on the market and amazing t orque.”

“Horsepower” (horsepower) is how we measure the pow er of a motor or an engine, in part because when cars were first introd uced, people compared them to the most common form of transportation before the automobile, which was a horse, of course. So, “horsepower” would refer to h ow many horses you would need to travel as fast or to have the same power as  the car. It’s equal to 550 foot pounds per second, which is the equivalent of 745.7  watts. I know, that isn’t a very helpful definition.

Martin says this car “has more horsepower than any car on the market,” meaning basically it’s more powerful than any car that is b eing sold right now. That’s what he means by the expression “on the market” (market) . He says the car also has “amazing,” meaning very good, “torque” (torque). “T orque” refers to the power of

turning or rotating something. In this case, howeve r, it is a measure of how quickly the car can go faster, can “accelerate” (ac celerate).

“To accelerate” means to increase in speed. That’s why in a car you have a, what we call a “pedal” (pedal), which is a long piece of  plastic or metal that you press on with your foot to make the car go faster. We cal l that pedal the “accelerator.” That makes the car go faster. The other pedal is ca lled the “brake” (brake) that slows down or stops a car. The opposite, however, of “acceleration” is “deceleration,” but we don’t call a brake a “decele rator.” We call it a “brake.”

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Martin also says to A sta, “You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.” “You wouldn’t believe” means I’m going to te ll you something that is very difficult for you to believe because it’s so amazin g. “You wouldn’t believe the RPMs” – the revolutions per minute. RPMs is a measu re of how fast something moves around what we call an “axis” (axis). Basical ly it’s a measure of how hard the engine is working in a car.

Asta then says, “So it can go fast?” Martin says, “ Yeah. It can go fast. It’s supposed to be really responsive, too, and the revi ews say that the acceleration is really smooth.” When we say a car is “responsive ” (responsive), we mean that when you, for example, try to turn the car to go le ft or right, it responds very quickly; more generally, the car seems to do what y ou want it to do very easily.

Martin also says that the “reviews,” meaning articl es about the car in the newspaper or in a magazine, “say that the accelerat ion is really smooth.” We’ve already defined “acceleration” as how fast the car goes from one speed to another, how quickly it can accelerate. If the acce leration is “smooth” (smooth), it feels as though there are no bumps, or that you don ’t have any difficulty going from one speed to another. Martin adds, “I bet that ’s because of the tuning” (tuning). “Tuning” refers to how the car’s motor or  engine is adjusted so that it runs smoothly. It runs without any problems.

Asta is not interested in all of these issues that Martin is. She says instead, “I like cars with more trunk space.” The “trunk” (trunk) of  a car, in American cars, is in the back of the car. It’s where you can put things such as luggage or big boxes and bags. “Trunk space” refers to how much room you  have in your trunk. In British English, the trunk is called the “boot” (bo ot).

Martin says, “You don’t drive a car like the McQ for its storage capacity.” “Storage (storage) capacity (capacity)” is the amou nt of room in something, the amount of space you have to store or put something in. Martin is saying that a

car like the McQ is not one you would buy because it’s a car you can put a lot of things in. He says, “You drive it for speed.”

Asta then says, “My cousin” – that is, the son or d aughter of my aunt or uncle – “doesn’t like it that much. He says it doesn’t have  enough legroom” (legroom). “Legroom” refers to the amount of space in front of  you for your legs. If you travel on an airplane, you know that many airplanes don’t have very much legroom, especially in the cheaper seats, the less expensive  seats, where I go on an airplane. There isn’t a lot of legroom. There isn’t  a lot of space for your legs, especially if you’re a tall person.

Martin is surprised by what Asta is saying. He says , “What?! Your cousin owns a McQ?” Asta says, “Yes, but he only drives it when h is Ediger is in the shop.” “Ediger” here is another kind of car. I don’t think  it’s a real car, but I’ll have to ask my friend Warren. In any case, Asta says that her c ousin only drives his McQ when his other car, his Ediger, “is in the shop” (s hop). If your car is “in the shop,” it is being fixed. It is being repaired by someone who fixes cars. We call that person, by the way, a “mechanic.” “Shop” here refer s to a place where something is fixed or repaired.

Martin says, “How is it possible that I’ve known yo u for years and this is the first time you’ve mentioned this cousin to me? You know t hat I’m the biggest car enthusiast in the world, don’t you?” A “car enthusi ast” (enthusiast) is a person who loves cars. You could be a “stamp enthusiast.” You could be a “coffee enthusiast.” An “enthusiast” is someone who loves s omething, who’s very interested in something.

Asta says, “My cousin isn’t in town very often.” “I n town” here means he isn’t in the city or the town where he normally lives. “He’s  usually traveling to races,” she says. Martin says, “Your cousin is a race car drive r?” A “race” (race) “car” (car) is a car that goes very fast that competes in a race o r a competition to see who can drive the fastest. A “race car driver” then, of cou rse, would be someone who drives a fast car in a contest or competition.

Asta says, “Yes, didn’t I mention that either?” Ast a hasn’t been telling Martin that her cousin owns these fast cars and is, in fact, a race car driver.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Martin: Did you see that? It’s the new McQ. It does  0 to 60 in four seconds. It has amazing performance.

Asta: That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the color .

Martin: Color?! Who cares about the color? The McQ is supposed to top out at 155, but it’s been clocked at 160. Can you imagine?

Asta: No, I can’t.

Martin: It has more horsepower than any car on the market and amazing torque. You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.

Asta: So it can go fast?

Martin: Yeah, it can go fast. It’s supposed to be r eally responsive, too, and the reviews say that the acceleration is really smooth.  I bet that’s because of the tuning.

Asta: I like cars with more trunk space.

# Types of Metal

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,291 – Types of Metal.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,291. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESL Pod.com for more information about this p odcast.

This episode is a dialogue between Raquel and Chris  about types of metal, that usually hard material that you usually find in the ground. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raquel: You’re not going to believe what my client wants for the finishes in their new house.

Chris: You’re the interior decorator to the rich an d famous, so nothing would surprise me.

Raquel: My client wants only precious metals. He wa nts his bathroom fixtures to be made of platinum and gold.

Chris: You’re kidding! Stainless steel, bronze, or nickel ones aren’t good enough for him?

Raquel: Not even close. I suggested some aluminum l ight fixtures for the living room and he told me he wanted solid silver.

Chris: But for the kitchen, there’s got to be more run-of-the-mill metals, like tin or copper, right?

Raquel: He hasn’t asked me to stock the kitchen yet , but if he does, I wouldn’t be surprised if he asked for titanium forks!

Chris: Yours is a strange job, catering to the wish es of the rich.

Raquel: That’s true, but it’s taught me a lot.

Chris: What?

 Raquel: To truly appreciate the ordinary!

[end of dialogue]

Raquel begins our dialogue by saying to Chris, “You ’re not going to believe what my client wants for the finishes in their new house .” “You’re not going to believe” is an expression we use when we are about to say so mething that is surprising or perhaps difficult to believe. A “client” (client) i s a person who pays you money to do something for him. People who are designers or l awyers or other service professionals have “clients.” It’s just another wor d for a “customer.”

Raquel’s client wants to have what she thinks are s ome rather surprising “finishes” (finishes) in his or her new house.” “Fi nishes” refers to the outside, if you will, of things that are in the house – the sur faces in the house. We’ll get a better idea about what kind of finishes we’re talki ng about in a minute here. Chris says, “You’re the interior decorator to the rich an d famous, so nothing would surprise me.”

We learn that Raquel is an “interior (interior) dec orator (decorator).” An “interior decorator” is a person who is responsible for makin g the inside of your house or your office look nice. An interior decorator is som eone who decides on what kind of chairs and tables and other furniture would go i nto a new room or a new house. An interior decorator decides what color pai nt to put on the walls – all the things that would make a room have a certain look a re decided upon by an interior decorator.

Chris is describing Raquel as “the interior decorat or to the rich and famous” – people who have a lot of money or people whom every one seems to know. Raquel says, “My client wants only precious metals. ” “Precious (precious) metals (metals)” are things like gold, silver, platinum, a nd other metals that are very expensive and often used in things like jewelry, su ch as rings or pendants.

Raquel says that her client – we now learn it’s a m an – “wants his bathroom fixtures to be made of platinum and gold.” Your “ba throom fixtures” (fixtures) are things such as “faucets,” which is what you use to turn on the water in your sink or in your bathtub. A “fixture” is anything that is  attached, or fixed, to something else. If you have a shower in your bathroom, you ha ve a “showerhead,” something that is used to pour the water or spray t he water over you. That would be a “fixture.”

This client of Raquel’s wants his bathroom fixtures  “to be made of,” or to be from, the materials “platinum” and “gold.” “Platinum” (pl atinum) is a silvery, white, hard metal. If you want to be technical, it has the atom ic number 78 with the chemical symbol Pt. For the rest of us, it’s just a really e xpensive metal that looks like silver. “Gold” (gold) has the chemical symbol Au an d the atomic number 79. I’m sure you’re all remembering your days back in high school as I say that. It’s a bright yellow metal that is often used in jewelry, and in the old days was used in people’s teeth.

Chris says, “You’re kidding,” meaning you’re joking . Then he says, “Stainless steel, bronze, or nickel aren’t good enough for him ?” Chris names three other kinds of more common metals, metals that are less e xpensive. They include “stainless (stainless) steel (steel).” “Steel” is a  hard metal. “Stainless steel” is a metal that has another metal mixed with it called “ chromium” (chromium). This prevents the steel from rusting, from turning a ora nge color. It is usually shiny – that is, it reflects light easily.

“Bronze” (bronze) is an orange-golden combination of metals. It’s made from copper and some other metal, often tin (tin). Bronz e is what we call an “alloy” (alloy). It’s a mixture of two different metals, bu t it’s mostly copper. Bronze is often used in sculptures and statues. If you leave it for a long enough time, bronze will often turn green. Copper will also ofte n turn a greenish color over time.

“Nickel” (nickel) is another kind of metal. It has the atomic number 28. It’s a silver, white, shiny metal. In the United States, t he five-cent coin is called a “nickel” because it is made in part from nickel. It ’s mostly copper, I think, but it’s partially made of nickel, and it has a shiny, silve r-like color to it. Raquel says that these cheaper metals are not good enough for her cl ient. She says, “Not even close,” meaning they’re not anywhere near good enou gh for him.

She says that she “suggested some aluminum light fi xtures for the living room” and he, her client, told her “he wanted solid silve r.” “Aluminum” (pronounced in British English “aluminium,” because it’s spelled d ifferent) is a relatively inexpensive or cheap metal. It has atomic number 13  and the chemical symbol Al. It’s something that costs less money to use, bu t of course Raquel’s client didn’t want aluminum light fixtures. He wanted ones  made of “solid silver” (silver).

I’ve been talking about silver for a few minutes he re, assuming you know what it is. If not, it’s atomic number 47. Does that help? How about chemical element symbol Ag? Ah, now you understand. It’s shiny gray metal often used in jewelry.

Raquel’s client wants his light fixtures – the thin gs that are used to hold lightbulbs, basically – made of solid silver, which  would be very expensive.

Chris says, “But for the kitchen, there’s got to be ,” meaning there has to be, “more run-of-the-mill metals like tin or copper, ri ght?” “Run (run) – of – the – mill (mill)” is a term used to describe something that i s standard, ordinary, usual. In this case, not expensive. Chris is suggesting that the client will use run-of-the-mill metals for his kitchen, things like “tin” (tin) or “copper” (copper). “Tin,” I’ve already mentioned, is another metal with a silver-white loo k to it. “Copper” has sort of a reddish-orange color.

Raquel says that her client hasn’t asked her “to st ock the kitchen yet, but if he does,” she says, “I wouldn’t be surprised if he ask ed for titanium forks.” “To stock” (stock) means to have something available so  that the, in this case, client can use it. Raquel says that she would not be surpr ised if her client asked for “titanium (titanium) forks.”

“Titanium” is a very strong, silver-colored metal t hat is nowadays sometimes used in making things such as kitchen appliances – things that you use in the kitchen. It’s a very strong metal. There was a famo us song called “Titanium” just a few years ago. Don’t worry, I won’t sing it now.

Chris says, “Yours is a strange job,” meaning you h ave a strange or weird job, Raquel, “catering to the wishes of the rich,” he sa ys. “To cater (cater) to” someone means to do exactly what that person wants.  In this case, Raquel caters to the wishes or wants or desires of rich pe ople. There are a lot of people here in Los Angeles who do that – cater to the wish es of the rich celebrities, the movie stars and so on, who live here.

Raquel says, “That’s true, but it’s taught me a lot ,” meaning I’ve learned a lot from this experience of working with the rich. Chri s says, “What?” Raquel responds, “To truly” – that is, to really – “apprec iate the ordinary.” The “ordinary” (ordinary) refers to things that are common, that a re normal, that are everyday – the sorts of things that you don’t often see here i n Hollywood.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Raquel: You’re not going to believe what my client wants for the finishes in their new house.

Chris: You’re the interior decorator to the rich an d famous, so nothing would surprise me.

# Being a Victim of Extortion

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,292 – Being a Victim of Extortion.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,292. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California (although it’s ra ining right now).

Visit our website at ESLPod.com, where it’s never r aining.

This episode is a dialogue between Jason and Ida ab out someone trying to get money from you illegally. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jason: Hey, that guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?

Ida: Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it.

Jason: What’s going on here? Why did you just let t hat guy take things without paying?

Ida: If you must know, I’m paying for protection.

Jason: Protection? From whom?

Ida: Those guys. They rule this neighborhood. If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.

Jason: You mean this is a shakedown? They’re threat ening you with violence unless you pay?

Ida: Yes, but what else can I do? All of the busine sses on this street pay, one way or another.

Jason: But a protection racket is extortion. It’s a gainst the law. You could tell the police.

Ida: The last person who squealed had his store tor ched. I’m not going up against these guys. Things could get ugly, really u gly. Are you leaving?

Jason: Yeah, I’m going to try to find that that guy  who was here and talk to him, tell him to lay off you.

Ida: You can’t do that! Those guys mean business. T hey’ll hurt you.

Jason: Not a chance. When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure.

Ida: Stop! I’m not letting you stick your neck out for me. Your funeral won’t be on my head!

[end of dialogue]

Jason begins our dialogue by saying to Ida, “Hey, t hat guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?” Jason says, “H ey” (hey), a way of getting Ida’s attention, getting her to listen to him. “Tha t guy,” meaning that man, “took merchandise” (merchandise). “Merchandise” refers to  things that you sell. We might also call them “goods” (goods). They are thin gs, physical things, usually, that you sell, such as plates and cups and computer s and chairs and microphones and, well, anything that you can sell.

Ida says, “Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it,” m eaning “Don’t worry about it.” Jason is confused. He says, “What’s going on here?”  meaning “What is happening here?” “Why did you just let that guy tak e things without paying?” Ida says, “If you must know,” meaning if it is necessar y that I tell you, “I’m paying for protection.” “Protection” (protection) is normally something you do to prevent you from getting hurt, but here it’s used to refer to m oney or things you give a group of people so that they will not hurt you. Usually t hese are criminals who say to you, “We won’t hurt you if you give us money.”

So really, they’re stealing something from you, jus t in a different way. They’re taking your money – or in this case, your “merchand ise” – so that you won’t get hurt even worse. Jason says, “Protection? From whom ?” Ida says, “Those guys,” meaning those men. “They rule this neighborhood.” “ To rule” (rule) means to be in control or to have power over someone else. Ida explains, “If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.” “To pay u p” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give someone money that you owe that per son, especially when you don’t really want to give him any money.

If, for example, you borrow money from another pers on, that person eventually will ask you to pay up, to give him the money that you borrowed from him. Ida says, “If businesses don’t pay up,” meaning don’t g ive money to these criminals,

the criminals “resort (resort) to violence.” “To re sort to violence” means to start hurting other people physically or even killing peo ple. When you feel you have no other choice or no other option, you resort to viol ence when more peaceful methods don’t work.

Jason says, “You mean this is a shakedown?” A “shak edown” (shakedown) is when someone tells you that something bad will happ en to you if you don’t give that person money. A shakedown is often done when s omeone discovers something bad about you, that if other people found  out would be embarrassing or perhaps hurt you in some way. So, the person say s, “I won’t tell anyone if you give me some money.” That’s a kind of “shakedown.” Here, the shakedown involves not hurting the business as long as the bu siness gives the criminals some money.

Jason then asks, “They’re threatening you with viol ence unless you pay?” “To threaten” (threaten) means to say to someone that b ad things will happen to that person unless that person does what you want him to  do. Ida says, “Yes” – yes, they’re threatening me. “But what else can I do? Al l of the businesses on this street pay one way or another.”

Jason says, “But a protection racket is extortion. It’s against the law. You could tell the police.” A “protection racket” (racket) is  an illegal agreement with a group of people to protect people and businesses if those  businesses or those people give money to a certain group of criminals. Any kin d of “racket” is an illegal agreement. So, a “protection racket” is an illegal agreement that is about not hurting someone if that person gives you money, or in this case, a group of criminals money.

Jason says a protection racket is “extortion” (exto rtion). “Extortion” is a crime. It’s the act of getting someone to do something because you threaten that person – that is, you say to that person, “I’m going to hurt  you unless you do something that I want you to do.” You can hurt people in many  different ways. It doesn’t have to be just hitting them or hurting them physic ally. You could do other things to hurt a person. All of those things would be rela ted to this crime of extortion – when you tell someone he has to do something for yo u, and if he doesn’t, then you will do something bad to him.

Ida explains that even though this is against the l aw, she can’t tell the police. Why? Well, because she says, “The last person who s quealed had his store torched.” “To squeal” (squeal) means to report some one’s bad or illegal behavior to the government or the police or someone who is, we would say, “in authority.” The verb “to squeal” is meant to have a negative co nnotation – that is, it’s

supposed to be a bad thing to tell the police or to  tell the teacher that someone else is doing something wrong.

Another word for that is “tattling.” “To tattle” (t attle) means to report someone to the authorities. We also use the phrasal verb “to t ell on” someone. If a child says to another friend of his, “Don’t tell on me,” he me ans don’t tell his mother or the teacher that he did something wrong. We usually thi nk this is a bad thing, probably because we value loyalty, protecting our f riends and relationships.

Ida, in any case, says that this other person who d id tell the police had his store “torched” (torched). If you have your house or your  store or your building “torched,” someone has burned it down. Someone has started a fire to burn it down in order to destroy it. Ida continues, “I’m no t going up against these guys.” “To go up against” someone is to oppose someone or to try to beat someone, especially someone who’s powerful. “Things could ge t ugly, really ugly,” Ida says. The expression “to get ugly” means to become danger ous or unpleasant, or to have a bad result.

“Are you leaving?” Ida then says to Jason. Jason sa ys, “Yeah, I’m going to try to find that guy who was here and talk to him, tell hi m to lay off you.” The phrasal verb “to lay (lay) off” usually means to stop doing  something. In this case, it means to stop bothering another person. If you are bothering someone, perhaps criticizing him or making fun of him, he might say,  “Lay off me,” meaning stop criticizing, stop bothering me.

Ida says, “You can’t do that. Those guys mean busin ess.” The expression “to mean (mean) business” means to be very serious abou t what you do, to not be joking or pretending. Ida says, “They’ll hurt you.”  Jason says, “Not a chance,” meaning no, they won’t. That’s not even possible. “ When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure,” meaning t hey will definitely stop when I tell them that I am going to protect you.

But Ida says, “Stop! I’m not letting you stick your  neck out for me.” The phrase “to stick (stick) your neck (neck) out for” someone, or  simply “to stick your neck out,” means to do something that might cause you harm, to  do something “risky” (risky), to do something dangerous, something that may cause you to get hurt. Ida does not want Jason stick his neck out for her.

She says, “Your funeral won’t be on my head.” A “fu neral” (funeral) is a service or a ceremony or simply some event that is done when s omeone dies, usually to remember that person. Ida is saying that she doesn’ t want Jason’s funeral to be

on her head, meaning to be something she is respons ible for, or more importantly something that she will be blamed for, something she will be guilty of.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jason: Hey, that guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?

Ida: Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it.

Jason: What’s going on here? Why did you just let t hat guy take things without paying?

Ida: If you must know, I’m paying for protection.

Jason: Protection? From whom?

Ida: Those guys. They rule this neighborhood. If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.

Jason: You mean this is a shakedown? They’re threat ening you with violence unless you pay?

Ida: Yes, but what else can I do? All of the busine sses on this street pay, one way or another.

Jason: But a protection racket is extortion. It’s a gainst the law. You could tell the police.

Ida: The last person who squealed had his store tor ched. I’m not going up against these guys. Things could get ugly, really u gly. Are you leaving?

Jason: Yeah, I’m going to try to find that that guy  who was here and talk to him, tell him to lay off you.

Ida: You can’t do that! Those guys mean business. T hey’ll hurt you.

Jason: Not a chance. When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure.

 Ida: Stop! I’m not letting you stick your neck out for me. Your funeral won’t be on my head!

# Types of Body Noises

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,293 – Types of Body Noises.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,293. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com for more information. This episode  is a dialogue between Ann and Milo about noises that the human body makes , even when you don’t want it to. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I’ve had it. Jim has got to go!

Milo: Go? He’s my best friend. I told him he could stay here until he got back on his feet. He’s not in your way, is he?

Ann: He doesn’t have to get in my way for me to kno w he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly I can hear him from our b edroom. He’s constantly hiccupping and wheezing, too.

Milo: Well, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hic cups, or wheezes.

Ann: But he can help snorting when he laughs and wh istling all the time. And he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall.

Milo: Those are bad habits. You know it’s hard to b reak bad habits.

Ann: And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the living room? That’s disgusting!

Milo: Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not awa re he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone.

Ann: Really? I wonder why.

[end of dialogue]

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Milo, “I’ve ha d it.” When someone says they “have had it,” he means he is no longer able t o tolerate or allow something. When a situation becomes so difficult or so impossi ble for someone that the person no longer wants to deal with it – no longer wants to, we would say, “put up with it” – that person might say that he’s “had it.” Another phrasal verb we use in this situation is “to be fed (fed) up.” If someo ne says, “I’m fed up,” he means he’s angry. He’s mad and he doesn’t want to put up with, or tolerate, a situation any longer.

Ann has a problem with Jim. She says, “Jim has got to go,” meaning Jim must leave. Milo says, “Go? He’s my best friend.” So, Ji m is Milo’s best friend. Milo continues, “I told him,” meaning I told Jim, “he co uld stay here until he got back on his feet.” So, Milo has told his friend Jim that  Jim could live at his house “until he got back on his feet.”

Usually we use that expression “to get back on your  feet” when you have been in a difficult situation and you need time before you can go back and do the things you normally do. It may be that you were ill, that you were sick, or perhaps you lost your job and don’t have any money. Both of the se would be cases where you might need to get back on your feet, by either gett ing well or getting a job.

Milo says that Jim is “not in your way, is he?” He’ s asking Ann if Jim is in her way. “To be in someone’s way” (way) means to be pre venting another person from doing what that person wants, either because y ou are physically in the same space that person wants to be, or perhaps you are getting in the way or bothering the person because you are preventing tha t person from doing what he wants.

Ann says that Jim “doesn’t have to get in my way for me to know he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly,” Ann says,  “I can hear him from our bedroom.” So, Ann and Milo are a couple living toge ther, and we have Jim, the friend, living in the house also. But Jim “snores” (snores). “To snore” means to make a loud noise when you are sleeping, usually wi th your nose and mouth. That would be snoring. I sometimes snore. That’s wh at my wife tells me, anyway. I’m not sure it’s true, though. I don’t think it is . I’ve never heard myself snoring so I don’t think I actually do.

But Jim definitely does because Ann can hear him fr om her bedroom – that is, where she and Milo sleep. Ann says that Jim is “con stantly hiccupping and wheezing, too.” To do something “constantly” means all of the time or repeatedly, over and over again. It’s often used nowadays to me an simply a lot, so much so that it seems as though it is happening continually , or without interruption.

 “To hiccup” (hiccup) is to make a noise, without wa nting to, that sounds a little like a cough but usually is a higher pitch and is s omething that goes on for a certain number of minutes, perhaps, or even longer.  It’s not something that people want to do, but it’s something their body do es “involuntarily,” we would say. You breathe in suddenly and it makes a noise. That’s “to hiccup.”

“To wheeze” (wheeze) is to breathe in, making a ver y loud sound. Often this happens when you are sick, when you have some sort of illness in your lungs, the parts of your body that take in air and expel o r breathe out air. If you smoke a lot, sometimes you may also wheeze. Milo says, “Wel l, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hiccups, or wheezes.” When we say someone “ can’t help it,” we mean they have no power over that situation. They can’t change that situation.

Ann says, “But he can help snorting when he laughs and whistling all the time.” “To snort” (snort) is to make a loud noise when you  are breathing in, but more with your nose than with your lungs. It’s sort of l ike snoring, but you do it when you are awake. Some people do it sometimes when the y laugh. Sounds a little like a pig, actually. In fact, that is the way we d escribe the noise of a pig, “to snort.”

Jim snorts when he laughs and whistles all the time . “To whistle” (whistle) means to make a sound with your mouth, usually one that i s high-pitched. This is whistling. Well, that’s not very good whistling but  you get the idea. Ann says that Jim is always whistling, “and he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall,” she says.

“To crack (crack) your knuckles (knuckles)” means t o make a loud sound or noise by pushing your fingers into the flat part of  your hand. Your “knuckles” are the parts of your hand where the fingers meet the r est of your hand, what we would call the “palm” (palm) of the hand. “To crack  your knuckles” means to make a noise with the bones in your hands. I can’t do it myself, at least not willingly, not voluntarily, though as I grow old, o ther bones in my body begin to crack.

It’s driving Ann up the wall. “To drive someone up the wall” means to make someone crazy. It’s an expression that is used to m ean to bother or annoy someone. Milo says, “Those are bad habits.” A “habi t” (habit) is something you do all the time or something you do without thinkin g about it very much. A “bad habit” would be something that is not good for you that you do all the time.

Milo says, “You know it’s hard,” or difficult, “to break bad habits.” “To break a bad habit” means to stop doing something that is bad for you. Smoking cigarettes is a bad habit and you should probably break your bad ha bit, at least if you want to live long. Though not everyone who smokes dies from  smoking, but a lot of people do – enough so that it’s probably a good ide a. Ann says, “And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the l iving room? That’s disgusting.”

“To burp” (burp) is to make a loud noise allowing a ir to escape from your stomach, often because you have eaten something and  you have what is called “gas” (gas). It’s not a very pleasant sound. Here’s  an example, not by me. The verb “to fart” (fart) is definitely an informal one . A more polite way might be saying “to pass gas.” It basically is making a loud  noise when the gas, instead of going through your mouth and out your mouth, I shou ld say, goes out, well, the other end of your body. I won’t give you an example  of that.

In both cases, Ann is correct in saying that it’s o ften considered “disgusting” (disgusting). Something that is “disgusting” makes other people sick or uncomfortable. It’s something that is considered ve ry unpleasant or not nice. Milo says, “Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not aw are he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone.” Milo doesn’t thin k Jim is “aware” (aware). “To be aware” means to know something is happening, to kno w what is going on. The reason is that Jim has always “lived alone,” lived by himself.

Ann says, “Really? I wonder why.” Ann is making a j oke. She knows why Jim has probably always lived alone because no one wants to  live with him. He has all of these strange body noises he always makes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I’ve had it. Jim has got to go!

Milo: Go? He’s my best friend. I told him he could stay here until he got back on his feet. He’s not in your way, is he?

Ann: He doesn’t have to get in my way for me to kno w he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly I can hear him from our b edroom. He’s constantly hiccupping and wheezing, too.

Milo: Well, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hic cups, or wheezes.

Ann: But he can help snorting when he laughs and wh istling all the time. And he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall.

Milo: Those are bad habits. You know it’s hard to b reak bad habits.

Ann: And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the living room? That’s disgusting!

Milo: Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not awa re he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone.

# Chaperoning a Field Trip

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,294 – Chaperoning a Field Trip.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,294. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Rupi and Antonia  about two people going with a group of students, two adults going with a g roup of younger students, to make sure that they behave, that they don’t do anyt hing wrong on a field trip – a short trip, usually, from school to somewhere that is educationally interesting for students. Well, I’ll explain more when we get start ed. So let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rupi: I don’t think I’m cut out for this. How am I supposed to chaperone a class of students on a field trip?

Antonia: I thought you were gung-ho about being a c haperone for Nadia and the rest of her class on their trip to the children’s m useum. That’s why you volunteered.

Rupi: I was, but then I started reading this materi al the school sent me to prepare for the trip. I have so many duties.

Antonia: Like what?

Rupi: I’m supposed to supervise the children all the time, escorting them to the restrooms and making sure they don’t misbehave. I d on’t know what to do if the kids get out of hand.

Antonia: It’s not an overnight trip, just a morning  at the museum.

Rupi: I know, but I’m responsible for their safety.  What if I have to give first aid?

Antonia: The teacher will be there. He’ll know what  to do in a real emergency.

Rupi: But how am I supposed to keep track of so man y kids?

Antonia: Not all of the students are going on the t rip, just the ones with signed permission slips.

Rupi: Even so, it’s a big responsibility. There are  so many things that can go wrong.

Antonia: Do you want me to go in your place?

Rupi: Yes! No, I already told Nadia I’ll be going a nd she’s really excited. I don’t want to disappoint her.

Antonia: You’ll be absolutely fine. I’m sure it won ’t be like last time.

Rupi: Last time?

Antonia: Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

[end of dialogue]

Rupi begins by saying, “I don’t think I’m cut out f or this.” The phrasal verb “to be cut (cut) out (out) for” something means to have the right experience or preparation to deal with something or handle someth ing. More generally, it can mean simply to be prepared for something, or perhap s to have the natural ability to do something. Rupi says he’s not cut out for thi s. This is, we find out, chaperoning a class of students on a field trip. “T o chaperone” (chaperone) means to supervise or be responsible for another pe rson or group, especially a group of children or teenagers.

We call the person who chaperones a “chaperone.” As  a noun, it’s the person. As a verb, it’s the act of supervising or taking care of usually a group of younger students. These students are on a “field (field) tr ip (trip).” A “field trip” is usually when a group of students goes to a certain place in  their city or town for several hours as part of their education. It might be a tri p to a museum. It might be a trip to a park, or a place where they learn about nature  and science. Field trips are popular in American schools – at least, they’re pop ular with students. It’s a time for students to leave the school and learn about th eir world, learn about something perhaps they’re studying in another place .

Antonia says, “I thought you were gung-ho about bei ng a chaperone for Nadia and the rest of her class on their trip to the chil dren’s museum.” So this field trip is to a children’s museum. Antonia says that she th ought Rupi was “gung-ho.”

“Gung (gung) – ho (ho)” is a somewhat unusual expre ssion we use in American English to mean very enthusiastic or excited about doing something.

Someone who is “gung-ho” about his job or about a c ertain project is very excited about doing it, very “eager” (eager) about doing so mething. The expression apparently comes from a rather poor pronunciation of a Chinese expression that was used by some American soldiers during World War  II. I believe the original expression had to do with working together. In any case, in American English, it means to be enthusiastic about doing something.

Antonia thought Rupi was enthusiastic about being a  chaperone for his daughter’s class trip to a museum. She says, “That’ s why you volunteered.” “To volunteer” (volunteer) is to offer to do something without being paid for it or without being required to do it. A person who volun teers is called a “volunteer.” So once again, it can be a verb or a noun. Rupi say s, “I was, but then I started reading this material the school sent me to prepare  for the trip.”

Rupi says he was gung-ho, but now he is not because  he had to read all of this material and he discovered something. He discovered  that he has a lot of duties as a chaperone. “Duties” (duties) is the plural of a “duty” (duty), which means a task or a responsibility, something that you are ex pected or required to do, usually as part of your job. Antonia asks Rupi for some examples of these duties. That’s what she means when she says, “Like what?” m eaning give me some of these duties.

Rupi says, “I’m supposed to supervise the children all the time.” “To supervise” (supervise) a group of people or a person means to monitor or to be responsible for someone’s behavior, to be making sure that a pe rson does what he is supposed to do – in this case, to make sure the chi ldren are doing what they are supposed to do, which of course is not easy dependi ng on how old the children are and whether they are good children or bad child ren. My neighbor’s children, for example, are bad children. I would not want to supervise them. But back to our story.

Rupi has to also escort the children to the restroo ms. “To escort” (escort) means to go with another person to make sure he is safe o r to make sure that he does what he is supposed to do. Usually, however, “to es cort” a person means to go with the person for his protection and safety. Ther e is a noun that comes from this verb “escort.” The accent is on the first syll able. An “escort” is a person who is escorts another person to protect that person. H owever, the noun “escort” can also mean something different. It can also refer ty pically to a woman who is paid

to go with a man to do certain things – to be their  friend, but perhaps a little more than that, if you understand my meaning.

Well, here we’re not talking about escorts. We’re t alking about “escorting” children to the restrooms or the bathrooms and maki ng sure the children do not “misbehave.” “To misbehave” (misbehave) means not to do what you are supposed to do. That prefix “mis” (mis) means “not. ” “To behave” means to do or act the way you are supposed to, following the rule s. “To misbehave” means to do the opposite, not to follow the rules.

Rupi says, “I don’t know what to do if the kids get  out of hand.” The expression “to get out of hand” means for a situation to not b e controllable or to be unmanageable. If a situation “gets out of hand,” yo u are no longer able to control it or to prevent it from getting worse. Rupi is wor ried about what he’ll do if the kids get out of hand. Antonia says, “It’s not an overnig ht trip, just a morning at the museum.” “Overnight” (overnight) means from one day  to another. In this case, it would involve staying with the children over the ni ghttime.

Antonia is saying that it is not an overnight trip.  It’s just a few hours in the morning at a museum. In other words, it shouldn’t b e that difficult. Rupi says, “I know, but I’m responsible for their safety.” “Safet y” (safety) is the opposite of danger. It’s to be protected from bad things happen ing to you. “What if I have to give first aid?” Rupi asks. “First aid” (aid) is me dical help you give someone that isn’t very serious but has to be done because of an  accident or perhaps a sudden illness. “First aid” might include doing thi ngs to help a person until a real doctor or a paramedic arrive. Antonia says, “The te acher will be there. He’ll know what to do in a real emergency.”

Rupi says, “But how am I supposed to keep track of so many kids?” The expression “to keep track (track) of” something or someone means to pay attention to and know the location of people. In th is case, the kids have to be kept track of. We have to know where they are at al l times. Sometimes we use this expression “to keep track of” to mean simply t o keep records of or to know about, to monitor.

Antonia says, “Not all of the students are going on  the trip, just the ones with signed permission slips.” Most schools, in order to  take the children on a field trip outside of the school building, get the permission of the parents. The parents have to sign a piece of paper, a “slip” (slip) of p aper, that gives the school “permission” (permission). “Permission” is the same  as an okay, saying yes, it’s okay for my child to go on this trip. Rupi says, “E ven so,” even if we consider all

of those facts, “it’s a big responsibility. There a re so many things that can go wrong.”

Antonia then asks, “Do you want me to go in your pl ace?” In other words, I will go instead of you. Rupi says, “Yes!” But then he reali zes he’s made a mistake and immediately follows by saying, “No, I’ve already told Nadia,” his daughter, “I’ll be going and she’s really excited. I don’t want to dis appoint her.” Antonia says, “You’ll be absolutely fine,” meaning everything wil l be okay. “I’m sure it won’t be like the last time.” Now, we don’t know what Antoni a is referring to, what she’s talking about. Presumably, we can guess the last ti me there was a field trip perhaps there was some problem.

Rupi says, “Last time?” He wants to know what the p roblem was that happened on the last field trip, probably one that Antonia w as on. Antonia says, however, “Never mind.” That phrase, which is quite common in  American English, means “I don’t want to give you any more information,” “I do n’t want you to keep asking me about this topic,” or simply, “I don’t want to repe at what I just said because I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” Antonia says, “Neve r mind. Forget I mentioned it,” meaning forget the fact that I just said that there  was, or at least I suggested that there was, a problem last time.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rupi: I don’t think I’m cut out for this. How am I supposed to chaperone a class of students on a field trip?

Antonia: I thought you were gung-ho about being a c haperone for Nadia and the rest of her class on their trip to the children’s m useum. That’s why you volunteered.

Rupi: I was, but then I started reading this materi al the school sent me to prepare for the trip. I have so many duties.

Antonia: Like what?

Rupi: I’m supposed to supervise the children all the time, escorting them to the restrooms and making sure they don’t misbehave. I d on’t know what to do if the kids get out of hand.

Antonia: It’s not an overnight trip, just a morning  at the museum.

 Rupi: I know, but I’m responsible for their safety.  What if I have to give first aid?

Antonia: The teacher will be there. He’ll know what  to do in a real emergency.

Rupi: But how am I supposed to keep track of so man y kids?

Antonia: Not all of the students are going on the t rip, just the ones with signed permission slips.

Rupi: Even so, it’s a big responsibility. There are  so many things that can go wrong.

Antonia: Do you want me to go in your place?

Rupi: Yes! No, I already told Nadia I’ll be going a nd she’s really excited. I don’t want to disappoint her.

Antonia: You’ll be absolutely fine. I’m sure it won ’t be like last time.

Rupi: Last time?

Antonia: Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

# Buying a Watch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,295 – Buying a Watch.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,295. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Jack and a clerk , someone who sells things for a store, about buying a wristwatch. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk: Hello, are you shopping for a watch for your self?

Jack: Yes, I’m looking for a dress watch, something  understated with a simple face.

Clerk: We have plenty to choose from. Let me show y ou these quartz watches.

Jack: I’m looking for something with an automatic m ovement, something that is self-winding.

Clerk: Oh, in that case, let me show you these. The se have the finest workmanship you’ll find anywhere, with very hard cr ystals. Are you looking for something with a bezel? A leather strap or a metal one?

Jack: I’m not sure. My diving watch has a bezel and  chronograph, but I’m looking for something simpler. What’s the difference betwee n these two?

Clerk: This one has luminous hands and dial and is waterproof, and the other doesn’t have either feature.

Jack: Hmm, I can’t decide. I’ll take this one, this  one, and this one.

Clerk: All three?

Jack: Yes.

Clerk: Let me show you these diamond-encrusted watc hes we just got in.

Jack: You think I need more than four watches?

Clerk: No man of style would be without at least a dozen.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about buying or purchasing a “w atch” (watch), which is of course a small clock that tells you the time. Nowad ays when we say “watch,” we usually think of what was called more popularly in earlier years a “wrist (wrist) watch” because you wear it on the wrist of your han d – or the wrist of your arm, I should say. The “wrist” is where your arm meets you r hand, where they connect. There are also “pocket watches” that people used to  wear many years ago, not so much anymore, that you keep in your pocket. Nowa days, of course, many people don’t wear watches at all. They just look at  their phone to see what time it is.

The dialogue begins with the clerk saying to Jack, “Hello, are you shopping for a watch for yourself?” Jack says, “Yes, I’m looking f or a dress watch.” A “dress watch” is a watch that you would wear to a formal o r business event. It isn’t a big watch, one that has a lot of different functions on  it. It’s not a watch that does a lot other than tell you the time, but it looks nice . So, we call it a “dress watch.” Jack says he wants something “understated with a si mple face.” “Understated” (understated) means it’s simple or it doesn’t draw attention to itself. It’s not something that people will immediately notice, perh aps.

Jack wants a watch with a “simple face.” The “face”  of the watch is the front of it. We also talk about the “face” of a clock. It’s the part that you can see that has the numbers on it and the lines that indicate the time,  what we would call the “hands” (hands). In traditional watches, there are two hand s on the watch – a big hand, which is the longer of the two, and a little hand. Many watches, of course, don’t have any hands at all, but rather just have numbers . These are electronic watches.

The clerk says to Jack, “We have plenty to choose f rom,” meaning we have a lot of watches that you can select from. “Let me show y ou these quartz watches.” “Quartz” (quartz) is a kind of stone or crystal tha t is used to keep time. A “quartz watch,” then, uses a crystal to keep time, not what  we would call a “mechanical device.” Jack says, “I’m looking for something with  an automatic movement, something that is self-winding.” “Automatic movemen t” means pretty much the same as “self (self) – winding (winding).”

An “automatic movement” or “self-winding” watch use s the movement of the hand or the arm to help keep the watch going; it ac tually helps “wind” the watch. “To wind” (wind) means to move a small knob, someth ing that is on the side, typically, of a watch that is used to give the watc h energy so that it keeps going. We would say it keeps “ticking” (ticking). “To tick ” means to work or to function, especially when talking about a watch.

There are a little wheels inside of the watch that move, and they make, often, a small, what we would describe as, “ticking” sound. This is related to another expression that is used to describe the sound a clo ck or a watch makes, which is “tick tock” (tock). In any case, the clerk says, “L et me show you these.” She’s showing him some self-winding watches. She says, “T hese have the finest workmanship you’ll find anywhere, with very hard cr ystals.”

“Workmanship” (workmanship) refers to the quality a nd skill with which something is made. Something that is made very well  is something made with “fine workmanship.” These watches, according to the  clerk, have “very hard crystals.” In this case, the word “crystal” refers to the cover that protects the face of the watch. Most watches have some sort of coveri ng over the hands of the watch. The clerk says, “Are you looking for somethi ng with a bezel? A leather strap or a metal one?” A “bezel” (bezel) is a small  ring or circle around that crystal covering of the watch. Often it has numbers  on it.

The watch is held onto your wrist by a, we would ca ll, “wristband” (band) or a “strap” (strap). The strap can be made out of “leat her” (leather) or “metal” (metal), or at least those are the two most common materials  or things we make watch bands out of. “Leather” is a material that comes fr om the skin of an animal, such as a cow. A “metal strap” would be made out of some thing such as iron, steel, silver, or other kinds of hard metals.

Jack says he’s not sure. He says, “My diving watch has a bezel and a chronograph but I’m looking for something simpler.”  A “diving (diving) watch” is one that you can use to go swimming or down into the ocean or a lake. When you go down into the ocean or lake, you “dive” into  that water. In fact, “diving” is usually done with some sort of special equipment, a llowing you to breathe for a long time underwater.

A “chronograph” or “chronograph” (chronograph) is a nother word for what is more commonly called a “stopwatch.” It’s a watch yo u use to determine how long something is going on. If you are running a race, f or example, you will have someone typically who has a stopwatch, who turns a watch on when you start

running and off when you finish. That tells you how  long someone has been doing something.

Jack says he’s looking for something simpler than h is diving watch. He then asks what the differences are between two different kind s of watches he’s looking at. The clerk explains, “This one has luminous hands an d dial and is waterproof.” “Luminous” (luminous) means that it can be seen eve n when it is dark out. So, the hands that, you remember, indicate what time it  is are luminous on this particular watch and so is the “dial” (dial). The d ial of a clock or a watch is just another word for the face of it – the front of it t hat has the numbers on it.

The clerk also tells Jack that the watch he’s looki ng at is “waterproof” (waterproof). Something that is waterproof is somet hing that is usually sealed so that the water will not harm it, will not damage it . You can put a waterproof watch in the water and it will still work just fine. Nowa days companies are starting to make waterproof phones, although they’re still not quite perfect from what I hear.

In any case, the clerk is showing Jack these watche s and he says, “I can’t decide.” Then he says, “I’ll take this one, this on e, and this one,” and he’s indicating three watches that he wants to buy. The clerk is surprised. She says, “All three?” Jack says, “Yes.” Then the clerk, real izing that perhaps he can sell Jack something even more expensive because he obvio usly has a lot of money, says to him, “Let me show you these diamond-encrust ed watches we just got in,” meaning that just arrived to our store.

“Diamonds” (diamonds) are clear, hard stones that a re very valuable. Women often get a diamond ring when they get married, as do some men. I don’t have a diamond on my wedding ring. I just have what’s call ed a “wedding band” (band). I mentioned previously about watch bands that go arou nd your wrist. Well, a “wedding band” goes around your finger, but of cour se it doesn’t have a watch on it.

Anyway, the clerk says that these watches are “diam ond-encrusted” (encrusted). “Diamond-encrusted” means that they are decorated w ith diamonds or that there are many diamonds on the watch itself. Jack says, “ You think I need more than four watches?” He’s wondering why the clerk is trying to sell him another watch. The clerk responds by saying, “No man of style woul d be without at least a dozen.”

The phrase “a man of style” (style) refers to a man  who has good taste, who knows what good clothing looks like and good watche s. No such man, according to the clerk, who of course wants to make more mone y by selling the customer

another watch, would be without at least a dozen, m eaning a man of style would have at least 12 watches and probably more.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk: Hello, are you shopping for a watch for your self?

Jack: Yes, I’m looking for a dress watch, something  understated with a simple face.

Clerk: We have plenty to choose from. Let me show y ou these quartz watches.

Jack: I’m looking for something with an automatic m ovement, something that is self-winding.

# Taking a Buyout

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,296 – Taking a Buyout.

This dialogue is between Hector and Erica about som eone leaving his job because he gets a lot of money from the company. So unds weird? Well, let’s find out more. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hector: So, are you taking the company buyout? It s ounds generous.

Erica: Of course it’s generous. The company saves a  lot of money by giving buyouts to senior employees with high salaries. Wha t they get in return is a huge savings. I’ve been giving it a lot of thought, but I’m still not sure what to do.

Hector: It makes sense for me to take the buyout, s ince I’m only two years from retirement. It would bridge the gap nicely.

Erica: Yeah, but for someone like me? I’m mid-caree r and the job market is tight. There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pay s as well as this one.

Hector: It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to take a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.

Erica: My options might be limited. No, I can’t tak e the risk. I’m staying.

Hector: Well, I’m leaving.

Erica: Sure?

Hector: Sure, I’m sure. A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.

[end of dialogue]

 The topic of this lesson is about “taking a buyout. ” Hector starts by saying, “So, are you taking the company buyout?” A “buyout” (buy out) is usually a large amount of money that a company gives an employee so  that the employee leaves the company. Now, why would a company do tha t? Well, Erica explains why. It’s of course to save the company money. So, the company can hire cheaper employees. This is especially popular for o lder employees who are perhaps close to retiring. Hector says the company buyout where he works “sounds generous” (generous).

Something that is “generous” is more than what you are required or perhaps expected to do. It’s often used simply to mean “a l ot.” “This is a generous amount of food.” That means it’s more than what you expect ed. It’s a lot of food. If someone says, “Oh, you’re very generous with your t ime,” that means that you give a lot of your time, probably even when you’re not being paid. The buyout, according to Hector, from the company is generous. Erica says, “Of course it’s generous. The company saves a lot of money by givin g buyouts to senior employees with high salaries.”

A “senior (senior) employee” is someone who is high  up in the organization – perhaps someone who has been there a long time, but  definitely someone who is responsible for parts of the company or who has a l ot of responsibility, and therefore probably someone who has a “high salary” (salary). “Salary” refers to the amount of money that you get paid every year to  work for a company. If you have a “high salary,” you are getting a lot of mone y. If you have a “low salary,” like me, you’re not getting very much money.

Erica continues, “What they,” meaning the people wh o own the company, “get in return is a huge savings.” “To get something in ret urn” means to receive something in exchange for what you have done or hav e given someone else. I give you $100, and I get in return a new phone, for  example, or whatever you give me for $100 – maybe a new iPhone. That would b e nice.

The company is getting, in return for its generous buyouts, “huge savings” (savings). “Savings” refers to money that you can u se in the future that you don’t have to spend, or simply money that you decide to k eep for a later day or for some other purpose. The company, by giving a huge b uyout or a generous buyout to employees, then doesn’t have to pay those  employees their salary in the future. Instead, of course, they hire or employ  new workers who receive lower salaries.

“I’ve been giving it a lot of thought,” says Erica,  “but I’m still not sure what to do.” Erica doesn’t know if she wants to take the company ’s buyout. Hector’s says, “It makes sense for me to take the buyout,” meaning it’ s logical or rational for me to take this buyout, “since I’m only two years from re tirement.” “Retirement” is usually the period later in life when you stop work ing at a regular job and do other things.

The case for Hector is that he is “two years from r etirement,” meaning he would probably normally retire two years from now. He say s this buyout, if he takes it, “would bridge the gap nicely.” The expression “to b ridge (bridge) the gap (gap)” means to make up the difference or to cover the dif ference between what you have now and what you need. What Hector means here is that it would allow him to survive until he is able to perhaps get his regu lar retirement pension or retirement salary that he will expect in two years’  time. The buyout would “bridge the gap.”

A “gap” is a space in between two things. In this c ase, I’m guessing, it’s the space between now – the space in time, if you will,  between now and when he’ll get his “pension” (pension). “Pension” is money tha t the company or perhaps the government gives you to live on when you’re not wor king when you retire. Erica’s situation is different. She says, “Yeah, but for so meone like me? I’m mid-career and the job market is tight.”

Erica says she’s “mid (mid) – career (career).” “To  be mid-career” is to be in the middle of your professional working life. Normally,  I would guess for most people, somewhere between, say, 40 and perhaps 55, although  people are working more years than they used to, so “mid-career” might for some people be even older than 55. I hope I’m in my mid-career now.

Erica says the “job market” (market) is “tight” (ti ght). The “job market” refers to the number of jobs there are, or more generally to the number of companies looking to hire people and the number of employees,  or the number of potential employees, looking for work. “The job market is tig ht,” Erica says. That means that there aren’t a lot of jobs that she could go a nd get if she quit the job she has now.

She says, in fact, “There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pays as well as this one.” A “guarantee” (guarantee) is basically a  promise that something will happen in the future. Erica says there’s no promise ; it’s not for sure that she will “land” (land) another job. “To land” something mean s to get something, especially something that is difficult to get. We o ften use this verb when talking

about a job. “I’m going to land a job at this compa ny.” That means I’m going to get a job at this company.

Hector says, “It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to t ake a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.” If something is “te mpting” (tempting), it’s attractive. It’s interesting. It makes you want to do it. If I see a piece of chocolate cake, I may say, “Well, that is tempting,” meaning it makes me want to eat the chocolate cake, which of course I know I shouldn’t.

A “lump (lump) sum (sum)” is a large amount of mone y that you get all at one time. The word “sum” here refers to an amount of mo ney. A “lump sum” is a large amount of money. The comparison here would be betwe en a “lump sum” and payments of that same amount over a period of time.  If I want to give you $500, I could give you $100 every month for five months, or  I could give it to you in a lump sum – all $500 right now.

Erica says, “My options,” or my choices, “might be limited” – that is, I might not have the freedom to do what I want to do. Then she says, deciding against taking the buyout, “No, I can’t take the risk” (risk). A “ risk” is the possibility that something bad will happen in the future. Erica says , “I’m staying,” meaning she’s not going to quit her job. She’s not going to leave .

Hector says, however, “I’m leaving.” Erica says, “S ure?” which is a short form of “Are you sure?” In this case, “Are you sure you are  leaving the company?” Hector says, “Sure, I’m sure.” Notice there’s another use of the word “sure” here to mean “yes.” So, when he says, “Sure, I’m sure,” he means, “Yes, I am sure.” I am certain. I’m going to leave the company. I have decided.

He says, “A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.” The “rat (rat) race (race)” is an expression  we use to describe the difficulties and the unpleasantness of trying to ma ke money, especially when you are competing against other people in the same comp any or perhaps even in different companies. The “rat race” is the unpleasa nt aspects, the not-so- attractive things about working in a job, especiall y one where there’s a lot of competition, in order to make money.

Hector says he wants to say goodbye to this rat rac e. He wants to be “the first one out the door,” meaning the first one to leave t he company. Interestingly, my father took a buyout from the school district where  he was working when he was 59 and a half years old. He decided he was going to  take a lump sum and retire early, and he lived a long and happy life, retiring  at the age of 59. I hope I am as lucky as he was to retire early.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hector: So, are you taking the company buyout? It s ounds generous.

Erica: Of course it’s generous. The company saves a  lot of money by giving buyouts to senior employees with high salaries. Wha t they get in return is a huge savings. I’ve been giving it a lot of thought, but I’m still not sure what to do.

Hector: It makes sense for me to take the buyout, s ince I’m only two years from retirement. It would bridge the gap nicely.

Erica: Yeah, but for someone like me? I’m mid-caree r and the job market is tight. There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pay s as well as this one.

Hector: It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to take a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.

Erica: My options might be limited. No, I can’t tak e the risk. I’m staying.

Hector: Well, I’m leaving.

Erica: Sure?

Hector: Sure, I’m sure. A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.

# Types of Neighborhoods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,297 – Types of Neighborhoods.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,297. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Shari and Ron ab out different kinds of neighborhoods, or sections in a city, and what we c all them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shari: Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up  several for you to view this afternoon.

Ron: Yes, I’m ready. It’s hard finding just the rig ht type of neighborhood to move to.

Shari: Yes, it’s been difficult, hasn’t it? How lon g have I been showing you homes?

Ron: About three months.

Shari: That’s right. First we looked at homes in pl anned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city, as you requested.

Ron: That’s right. At first, I thought I wanted a q uiet place to live in my retirement.

Shari: That’s why I also showed you homes in retire ment communities.

Ron: Yes, but once I saw them, I changed my mind. I ’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted a livelier neighborhood, somepla ce with more action.

Shari: That’s why I showed you homes in the histori c district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very  pedestrian-friendly.

Ron: Yes, but the more I thought about it, the more  I wanted to be in the middle of the action.

Shari: That’s why, today, I’m taking you to the urb an core. We’ll look at homes in the downtown area, the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves. We’ll visit some high-priced neighborhoods and some up-and-comi ng.

Ron: Great! I think house-hunting has given me a ne w lease on life. This is fun! I could look at home after home after home.

Shari: That’s what I’m afraid of.

[end of dialogue]

Shari begins by saying to Ron, “Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up several for you to view this afternoon.” “To line u p” or “to have lined up” means to plan and make ready or to schedule. In this case, w e have Shari, who we learn is a real estate agent. She’s a person responsible for  finding homes for someone to buy or rent. She has “organized” or scheduled some houses to show to Ron, who is looking for a house to buy or rent. I think he’s  buying a house.

Ron says, “I’m ready.” I’m ready to view or look at  the houses that Shari has lined up for him to see. He says, “It’s hard finding just  the right type of neighborhood to move to.” A “neighborhood” is an area within a city . Most large cities have several different sections, parts, or what we would  call “neighborhoods” – areas that usually are given a name. For example, here in  Los Angeles, Hollywood is actually a neighborhood within the city of Los Ange les. It’s not its own city. It’s part of the larger city. Venice is a neighborhood i n Los Angeles, and there are many different neighborhoods here.

Well, Ron is finding it difficult to know what kind  of neighborhood he wants to move to. He’s been looking for a house for three mo nths now. We learn from Shari that first, she and Ron looked at homes in “p lanned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city.” A “community” is another word for a neighborhood or area.

Sometimes “community” is used in a larger, more gen eral sense to refer to a large group of people who have similar backgrounds or live in a similar area, but here it refers to an area in a city. Although, it c ould also be used to refer to a single city. Here in Southern California, there are  “planned communities” that are their own city. Irvine, California, which is in the  southern part of Southern California, if that makes any sense, is a “planned community.”

A planned community is one where someone has sat do wn and decided where everything is going to be. In other words, it wasn’ t a small town that grew little by

little over many years. Instead, there was someone who had a plan who drew out were all the streets were going to be, and where the houses were going to be, and the parks, and the schools, and so on. Planned communities are often built at once – that is, the entire area, neighborhood, o r even city is built all over a short period of time, a couple of years even.

There are planned communities inside of cities. The re are also “gated (gated) communities.” A gated community is usually a group of homes that is surrounded by a fence or a wall to provide protection and secu rity for the people who live in that neighborhood. There is often a gate, an entran ce that you have to stop at and get permission in order to continue driving int o the community. The gate is typically on one of the larger streets that go into  that community.

We have gated communities here in Los Angeles, espe cially where very rich people live. There are gated communities just north  of where I live. I live where the poor people live, and the rich people live up i n the gated communities. Hollywood stars, movie stars, those sorts of folks are the ones that live in the gated communities here in L.A.

Shari also refers to “bedroom (bedroom) communities .” The “bedroom” is the area or the room in the house where you sleep, wher e you have your bed of course. “Bedroom communities,” however, refer to sm all towns that are next to a large city, where many people move to when they don ’t want to live in the city itself – perhaps because the city is too expensive,  or maybe it’s not safe, or perhaps the schools aren’t very good in the cities – and so people who work in the city live outside of the city in what are calle d “bedroom communities.”

These are often simply called “suburbs,” although a  suburb could be another city with something more than just houses. Bedroom commu nities are areas where there are mainly houses. There isn’t a lot of busin ess that you will find in a bedroom community. Los Angeles has lots of bedroom communities – towns that are outside of the city of Los Angeles where you wi ll find mostly homes. There aren’t a lot of large businesses there. Ron says th at he thought he wanted a quiet place to live “in his retirement.” “Retirement” is the period after you leave your job, usually when you are older.

Shari says, “That’s why I also showed you homes in retirement communities.” Yes, there are actually areas in the city, or in fa ct entire cities, that have mostly retired people in them. This concept, this idea, be came very popular in the 1970s, I guess 1980s also, where in the southern, e specially southwestern United States, as well as in Florida, in the southe ast part of the country, there

were small cities built mostly for retired people, for older people, who wanted a place where it would be quiet.

Ron says he thought he wanted to live in a retireme nt community, but once he saw them, he changed his mind – that is, he decided  he was wrong and had a different idea. He says, “I’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted to live in a livelier neighborhood, someplace with more action .” “Livelier” (livelier) comes from the adjective “lively,” which means there are perhaps a lot of people there, or there are things going on. There are small busin esses and restaurants and cafes. That would be a “livelier area” of the city,  or a “livelier neighborhood.”

Shari says, “That’s why I showed you homes in the h istoric district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very  pedestrian-friendly.” “Historic (historic) district (district)” refers to an area i n a city or town that is important for some reason. Often it’s the older part of town. A h istoric part of Los Angeles is the area near downtown where the first Spanish sett lers came back many hundreds of years ago. That’s the historic part of the city. The word “district” simply refers to an area within the city or within a town.

Shari also showed Ron the “redeveloped waterfront a rea.” The “waterfront” (waterfront) is obviously an area in the city next to some water. It could be a river. It could be a lake. It could be the ocean. “Redevel oped” means that it was an area that was perhaps old and had old buildings, or  buildings that people weren’t using anymore, and someone came and put new buildin gs there or they fixed up, they repaired, the old buildings so that people cou ld now live and work there. Many cities have redeveloped their waterfront areas , especially those in the older cities in the eastern part of the U.S.

Shari says that these areas that she showed Ron – t he historic district and the waterfront area – are both very “pedestrian (pedest rian) – friendly (friendly).” “Pedestrian” is a word we use to describe someone w ho walks, or someone who is walking along the street. So “pedestrian-friendl y” would be an area where it’s easy to walk up and down. There are some parts of t he city that are not pedestrian friendly, especially here in Los Angeles , but nobody walks in Los Angeles anyway so it doesn’t really matter.

Ron says, “Yes, the more I thought about it, the mo re I wanted to be in the middle of the action.” “In the middle of the action ” means where lots of things are happening – an area, in this case, where there are a lot of people, a lot of excitement perhaps. Shari says, “That’s why, today,  I’m taking you to the urban core” (core). “Urban” (urban) refers to the city. T he “urban core” of the city would

be the main or central part of a large city, not the bedroom communities, not the suburbs. The opposite of that.

“We’ll look at homes in the downtown area,” Shari s ays, “the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves.” “Downtown” refers to the main, central, usually business section of the city. It’s often, but not a lways, the older part of the city. The downtown area in Los Angeles is in fact the old est part of the city.

Shari’s also going to show Ron houses in the “arts (arts) district.” In some American cities, there are areas where there are a lot of artists who live, perhaps because the rents are cheaper, since artists normal ly don’t make a lot of money. The arts district is often an area that has cheaper  places to stay but is also an exciting area because there are a lot of artists th ere – painters and sculptors and other people who call themselves artists.

Shari’s also going to show Ron houses in a few “eth nic (ethnic) enclaves (enclaves).” An “enclave” is a small area within the city with people who come from the same country, cultural background, or perh aps speak the same language. These are often areas with “immigrants” –  people who’ve come from other countries, since the United States is, for the most part, a nation of immigrants.

“Ethnic” is an interesting word. “Ethnic” refers of ten to the country or region of the world from which you come or your ancestors – the p eople who first came to the United States – were from. So, I have Irish ethnici ty. I would say that’s my ethnic group. And there were, especially in cities such as  Boston, New York, Chicago, and my hometown, St. Paul, ethnic areas where the I rish lived. There were other “ethnic enclaves” where the Germans lived. So the w ord “ethnic” means national origin or sometimes regional origin.

Interestingly, the word “ethnic” has changed over t he years when we talk about politics. Back in the late ’70s, early 1980s, when people talked about the “ethnic vote,” they were referring mainly to southern and e astern European voters or those who are descendants of immigrants from those countries. Nowadays we tend to use the term to refer more to, say, those w ho are from Latin America or from Asia. But the term is a general one that can a pply to any nationality.

Shari says, “We’ll visit some high-priced neighborh oods and some up-and- coming.” The expression “up-and-coming” means that the area is getting more popular, more people are moving there. Ron says, “G reat! I think house-hunting has given me a new lease on life.” “House-hunting” refers to the process of looking for a house, usually to buy. The expression  “a new lease (lease) on life”

 means a new reason to feel happy to live, especiall y perhaps after you’ve had a difficult time in your life, or perhaps you’ve lost  someone or simply have grown older.

“A new lease on life” would give you a feeling of e xcitement, some new reason to live. Ron thinks that this is fun, this house-hunti ng. He says, “I could look at home after home after home.” In other words, he would lo ve to continue just looking at houses, not actually buying one.” Shari says, “That ’s what I’m afraid of.” Remember, Shari is a real estate agent. Her job is to find a house for Ron, but she doesn’t want to continue showing him houses for ever. She wants to get paid, and she only gets paid when Ron actually buys a hou se.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shari: Okay, ready to see more homes? I’ve lined up  several for you to view this afternoon.

Ron: Yes, I’m ready. It’s hard finding just the rig ht type of neighborhood to move to.

Shari: Yes, it’s been difficult, hasn’t it? How lon g have I been showing you homes?

Ron: About three months.

Shari: That’s right. First we looked at homes in pl anned and gated communities and in the bedroom communities around the city, as you requested.

Ron: That’s right. At first, I thought I wanted a q uiet place to live in my retirement.

Shari: That’s why I also showed you homes in retire ment communities.

Ron: Yes, but once I saw them, I changed my mind. I ’m retired, but I’m not dead. I decided I wanted a livelier neighborhood, somepla ce with more action.

Shari: That’s why I showed you homes in the histori c district and in the redeveloped waterfront area, both of which are very  pedestrian-friendly.

Ron: Yes, but the more I thought about it, the more  I wanted to be in the middle of the action.

 Shari: That’s why, today, I’m taking you to the urb an core. We’ll look at homes in the downtown area, the arts district, and a couple of ethnic enclaves. We’ll visit some high-priced neighborhoods and some up-and-comi ng.

Ron: Great! I think house-hunting has given me a ne w lease on life. This is fun! I could look at home after home after home.

Shari: That’s what I’m afraid of.

# Claiming Credit for an Invention

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,298 – Claiming Credit for an Invention.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,298. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Kitty and Albert o about saying that you came up with, or created, a new idea or a new thing when  you didn’t. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kitty: Wait a second. We invented the Macanator. It  was one of the most important technical achievements of our country.

Alberto: What? You can’t claim credit for the Macan ator. We beat you to it.

Kitty: You may have invented the precursor to the m odern-day Macanator, but we’re the ones who are the recognized inventors.

Alberto: That’s disputed. Just because we didn’t do cument the achievement, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

Kitty: You mean it’s a case of “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”

Alberto: I don’t think so.

Kitty: The fact is, you can try to rebut our claims  all you like, but you still have no proof.

Alberto: The proof is in the pudding. Don’t we make  the best Macanators in the world today?

Kitty: That’s beside the point. Okay, I will conced e that your country makes the best Macanators today, if you’ll concede that we in vented it.

Alberto: Never!

[end of dialogue]

 This dialogue is all about “inventions” (inventions ). “Inventions” as a word comes from the verb “to invent.” “To invent” means to cre ate or develop something that has never been made before. Usually inventions are physical things – things that you make with your hands or with a machine. That’s normally how we would think of an invention, though I suppose nowadays, w ith software and computer programming, we might think of it a little differen tly.

In any case, our dialogue begins with Kitty saying to Alberto, “Wait a second,” meaning stop. “We invented the Macanator. It was on e of the most important technical achievements of our country.” Kitty is sa ying that “we,” meaning she or someone from her country invented this machine or t his thing called a “Macanator.” We’re not sure what a Macanator is and  it’s not important.

What is important is that Kitty believes that it wa s “one of the most important technical achievements” of her country. A “technica l achievement” would be some great accomplishment, some great thing that in volves technology or tools, that makes life better in some way. A technical ach ievement would be, for example, the invention of the television or the sma rtphone or the wireless radio.

Alberto says, “What?” He’s very surprised. He says,  “You can’t claim credit for the Macanator. We beat you to it.” So, it appears t hat Kitty and Alberto are from two different countries, and Alberto is saying that  “we,” by which I think he means his country or someone from his country, “invented the Macanator,” and therefore Kitty’s country can’t “claim (claim) credit (credit ).”

“To claim credit” is to say that you are responsibl e for something that was done and that therefore you should receive the praise or  the recognition or the reward for it. You can claim credit for an idea just as we ll as for an invention. Usually when we use this expression “to claim credit,” we’r e saying that someone falsely claimed credit – that someone said that he invented  something or he thought of something when he really didn’t, just so that he co uld get the praise or recognition for it.

So, let’s say you and your coworker, a person you w ork with, are talking about an idea that you have. Well, later your coworker goes to your boss and claims credit for that idea, says that she thought of the idea. T hat would be an example of claiming credit for something. Alberto says that Ki tty’s country cannot claim credit for the Macanator. He says, “We beat you to it.” “T o beat (beat) someone to” something means to do something before another pers on does, or to be the first group or first person to do a certain thing. “The A mericans beat other countries to the moon” – they got there before other countries l anded on the moon.

 Kitty says, “You may have invented the precursor to  the modern-day Macanator, but we’re the ones who are the recognized inventors .” Kitty uses the word “precursor” (precursor). A precursor is something t hat happens before another event, and that leads to it in some way or is respo nsible for the later event that takes place. For example, the typewriter, the manua l typewriter, was in some ways the precursor to modern computer word processo rs – computers that did the same thing as a typewriter only in a better or different way.

Kitty says that Alberto’s country “invented the pre cursor to the modern-day,” or current, “Macanator,” this strange and unknown mach ine, “but we’re the ones who are the recognized inventors,” she says. “To be  recognized” means that you are acknowledged or seen by others as having done a  certain thing or to have accomplished a certain thing. We might say, “This r unner is recognized as the fastest man in the world.” Everyone knows him and a grees that yes, he is the fastest man in the world.

Alberto says, “That’s disputed.” Something that is “disputed” (disputed) is something that people do not agree on or something that is controversial – that is, people have different opinions about it and oft en disagree, sometimes with great emotion about it. Alberto says, “Just because  we didn’t document the achievement, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.” “To do cument” (document) something is to write it down or to do something th at makes a permanent or visible record of it.

Nowadays we might record a video to document someth ing happening. The word “document” is often used to describe pieces of pape r that have writing on them, or any kind of writing, such as a Microsoft Word do cument. That would be an electronic file that has information, written infor mation, on it. “To document” as a verb, however, means more generally to do something , to record a certain event in a permanent way that others can go and look at t o see that it actually happened.

Alberto says, “Just because we didn’t,” we did not,  “document the achievement” – that is, the invention of this machine – “does no t mean it didn’t happen.” It’s kind of hard to understand in that sentence because  there are a lot of negatives there. Basically what Alberto is saying is that eve n though we didn’t record it or document it, it still happened. Just because there’ s no evidence doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. It did happen, even though there is nothing to show or prove it happened.

Kitty then uses a famous expression in English abou t this exact situation. She says, “You mean it’s a case of ‘If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?’” This expression is  used sometimes to question whether something has value or meaning if no one is  actually there to see it or hear it. The obvious answer to this question, of co urse, is yes; things make sounds even though no one is there to hear the soun d waves that move through the air.

The expression is sometimes used jokingly, as thoug h it were some sort of great philosophical question. A “forest” (forest) is a la rge group of trees in a single area. Alberto says, “I don’t think so,” meaning “I don’t think this is an example of that case of the tree falling in the forest and no one being around to hear it.” Kitty then says, “The fact is, you can try to rebut our c laims all you like, but you still have no proof.” The expression “the fact is” is oft en used to emphasize that you are telling the truth or that what you are saying i s a fact. It is real. It is true.

The verb “to rebut” (rebut) means to present an opp osing view or opinion of something, to argue against something. Usually we u se this verb after another person has disagreed with us, so we present an argu ment, and the other person presents another argument against ours. We then “re but” his argument. So it’s usually, if you will, the third time that the quest ion has been addressed, although it’s not always used quite in that technical manner , the way we might use it in a formal debate or disagreement about a topic.

I published a scientific article about vocabulary n ot too long ago, and someone wrote an article disagreeing with me. I then was al lowed to rebut his argument. I wrote a second article disagreeing with the things he said about my article. Who was right? Who was correct? Well, I was, of course.  Kitty says that Alberto and his country can try to rebut her country’s “claims”  (claims) all they like. A “claim” is when you say something is true.

Kitty says, however, that Alberto has no “proof” (p roof). “Proof” is evidence, something that shows that you are correct. It could  be documents or other things that show that you are telling the truth. Alberto t hen uses another popular expression in his response, although it doesn’t mak e a lot of sense. He says, “The proof is in the pudding” (pudding). The word “ pudding” in British English is often used simply to mean what in American English we would call “dessert” (dessert) – something sweet that you eat at the end  of a meal. For short, it sometimes simply called a “pud” (pud).

In American English, a pudding is one kind of desse rt, a particular kind of dessert that often has what we would call a “creamy consist ency.” It has a creamy texture

or feel to it. In any case, the expression “The pro of is in the pudding” means that whether you are right or not is determined by wheth er you are successful. If something actually works, then that is the proof. T he proof or the evidence that you are correct is that something works.

The reason Alberto says that here is because he the n claims that his country makes the best Macanators in the world, and if that ’s true, therefore, he thinks they must have invented the Macanator. Of course, t hat isn’t really logical but that’s what Alberto is saying. Kitty, however, says , “That’s beside the point.” The expression “to be beside (beside) the point (point) ” means it’s not important. It’s not related to this topic. It’s irrelevant, we migh t also say. Something that is “irrelevant” is something that doesn’t matter. It’s  not important, especially when you are arguing about something or trying to make a  case for something.

Kitty says, “I will concede that your country makes  the best Macanators today.” “To concede” (concede) means to admit that somethin g is true when earlier you said it wasn’t true – you said it was false – to sa y, “Okay, you’re right. I was wrong about this.” Kitty says that she will concede  that Alberto’s country makes the best Macanators today, but she will only conced e that – she will only agree to say she was wrong – if Alberto concedes that her co untry invented the Macanator.

And Alberto says, “Never!” meaning no, he will not agree to that statement. He will not concede that Kitty’s country invented the Macanator. What is the Macanator? Well, it’s a mystery.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kitty: Wait a second. We invented the Macanator. It  was one of the most important technical achievements of our country.

Alberto: What? You can’t claim credit for the Macan ator. We beat you to it.

Kitty: You may have invented the precursor to the m odern-day Macanator, but we’re the ones who are the recognized inventors.

Alberto: That’s disputed. Just because we didn’t do cument the achievement, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

 Kitty: You mean it’s a case of “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”

Alberto: I don’t think so.

Kitty: The fact is, you can try to rebut our claims  all you like, but you still have no proof.

Alberto: The proof is in the pudding. Don’t we make  the best Macanators in the world today?

Kitty: That’s beside the point. Okay, I will conced e that your country makes the best Macanators today, if you’ll concede that we in vented it.

Alberto: Never!

# Trading Insults

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,299 – Trading Insults.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,299. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful – and I do mean beautiful – Los Angeles, California.

This episode is all about insulting or saying bad t hings about other people. This is going to be fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alan: Look at you! Did you get a haircut or did you r head get stuck in a weed whacker?

Doris: Look who’s talking. Maybe you should do some thing different with your hair, like wash it.

Alan: Oh, burn. That would have been a nice comebac k if it weren’t so dumb. Who taught you your one-liners? A friend? Oh, I for got. You don’t have any.

Doris: I think you’ve confused me with someone else  – you!

Alan: You couldn’t come up with your own put-down s o you had to borrow mine? How humiliating for you.

Doris: Not as humiliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that’ll improve it: a paper bag!

Alan: Oh, clever. I knew better insults when I was six years old.

Doris: You mean the same mental age you are now?

Alan: Give it up. Nobody can one-up me in trading i nsults. Your brain is no match for mine.

Doris: You’re right. You’re a person of rare intell igence. You rarely show any!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Alan saying to Doris, “L ook at you!” “Look at you” is used when we are trying to say something about some one’s physical appearance, about the way he looks. Alan says, “Loo k at you! Did you get a haircut or did your head get stuck in a weed whacke r?” A “haircut” (haircut) is when, you can probably guess, the length of the hai r on your head is made shorter by someone cutting it with a scissors or so me electronic device. We would call it a “razor” (razor). I don’t need to ge t a haircut anymore because I shave my head. I use a razor on the top of my head to get rid of the little hair I have left. But enough about me – back to our dialog ue.

Alan asks Doris – not seriously, but as a way of in sulting her or saying something bad about her – if she got a haircut or if her head  got “stuck in a weed whacker.” “To get stuck” (stuck) is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to be put into a place or a position and unable to move or to get yourself  out of that position or situation. Here in Los Angeles, we often talk about  getting stuck in traffic – that is, being unable to move very fast in our car because t here are so many other cars on the road or the freeway.

You could get your hands stuck, for example, in a s mall jar. Let’s say you are putting your hand into a small container or jar to get something out and then you can’t get your hand out of the jar or the container . Your hand is stuck. You’re unable to move it. Alan is jokingly asking Doris if  her hair got stuck in a “weed whacker.” “Weeds” (weeds) are small plants that gro w that you don’t want, that you want to get rid of. A “weed whacker” (weed whac ker) is a machine that is used to cut grass, especially at the end of a certa in area of grass. It’s a machine that is also used to quickly remove tall grass from  an area in your lawn or outside of a building. The verb “to whack” (whack) here mea ns to cut.

We sometimes use a weed whacker for small areas tha t we need to cut the lawn or to cut weeds down where we can’t use a regular, what we would call a “lawn mower,” which is a machine you use to cut grass. I should mention that you should be careful with this word “weed.” Weed” in t he singular is sometimes used informally to mean “marijuana,” that kind of plant that you smoke that can cause you to change your attitude or mood, that is illega l in many places. A “weed whacker” has nothing to do with marijuana.

Now, why is Alan asking Doris if she had her head s tuck in a weed whacker? Well, he’s saying that her haircut isn’t very good.  It looks as though someone did it as if they were cutting a lawn or cutting down w eeds. Doris responds to Alan by saying, “Look who’s talking.” That expression “Look  who’s talking” is used to say that another person who is criticizing you actually  has the same problem or the same situation. So if someone says to you, for exam ple, “Boy, you are looking

very tired,” and the person is saying that as a way  of insulting you, you might say, “Well, look who’s talking. You look even more tired  than I am.”

Doris, in other words, is insulting Alan right back  by saying that there is a problem with his hair. She says, “Maybe you should do something different with your hair, like” – or such as – “wash it.” Doris’s saying that Alan hasn’t washed his hair, and so his hair doesn’t look very good ei ther. Alan responds by recognizing or acknowledging that Doris has insulte d him in a clever or funny way. He says, “Oh, burn.” “Burn” (burn) here means insult – words that you use to insult – but he’s using it in a funny way, to be  funny.

He says, however, “That would have been a nice come back if it weren’t so dumb.” A “comeback” (comeback) is something you say  right after another person insults you or says something bad about you.  A “comeback” is supposed to be funny, or we would say “witty” (witty). “Witt y” is funny in an intelligent way, in a clever way. Alan doesn’t think that Doris’s in sult to him was very clever. It wasn’t a good comeback. That’s why he says, “That w ould have been a nice comeback if it weren’t so dumb.” He’s saying that it was a dumb comeback.

“Who taught you your one-liners?” A “one – liner” ( liner) is a joke that is only one, maybe two sentences long. Technically a “one-liner”  should just be one sentence, but it is often two or maybe even three s entences. Alan is saying that Doris isn’t very funny. He says, “Who taught you your one-liners? A friend?” Then he says, “Oh, I forgot. You don’t have any,” meanin g “You don’t have any friends” – which is, of course, another insult.

Doris says, “I think you’ve confused me with someon e else – you!” Doris means here that Alan is really talking about himself. Ala n says, “You couldn’t come up with your own put-down so you had to borrow mine?” Doris didn’t come up with a very good comeback and Alan recognizes that. “To co me up with” is a phrasal verb or expression meaning to invent or to think of  something, especially in a creative way. A “put-down” is another word for an i nsult or another term for saying something bad about another person.

Alan says, “How humiliating for you.” “To be humili ating” (humiliating) means to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Doris says, “Not as hu miliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that will i mprove it: A paper bag.” Alan says it’s humiliating for Doris to not be able to b e clever or original. Doris responds that it’s more humiliating for Alan to be so ugly. That’s what she means by saying “walking around with that face.” She says  she has something that will improve Alan’s face: a paper bag. Doris is saying t hat Alan is so ugly he should put a bag over his head.

 Alan says, “Oh, clever.” “Clever” (clever) means fu nny, creative, very smart in an unexpected way, in this case. But Alan here is bein g sarcastic – that is, he doesn’t really think Doris is clever. He’s saying t hat to mean the opposite, in fact, that she isn’t very clever. He says, “I knew better  insults when I was six years old,” meaning he was better or could do better insu lts, funnier insults, when he was a child.

Doris says, “You mean the same mental age you are n ow?” Your “mental (mental) age” is how old your mind is, which really  means how intelligent you are. Your body can be a certain physical age, but if you  have problems in your brain, your mental age – that is, your intelligence – migh t be much lower. That is, you’re not as smart as your body age, I guess you could sa y.

Alan then says to Doris, “Give it up.” The expressi on “to give it up” means to stop, especially to stop trying when something is t oo difficult. Alan then says, “Nobody can one-up me.” “To one-up” someone means to do something better than another person, usually right after that perso n does it. So you, for example, make a wonderful meal, and then your friend decides  to one-up you. He’s going to cook a meal even better than you did.

Alan tells Doris that no one can one-up him in “tra ding insults.” “To trade” (trade) here means to exchange something. So, I insult you and you insult me. Alan says, “Your brain is no match for mine.” The expres sion “not to be a match” (match) for something or someone means it’s not as good as something else or someone else. If I say, “Your team is no match for my team,” I mean that my team is better than your team. Your team is worse t han my team. Alan says that Doris’s brain is no match for his brain.

Doris says, “You’re right. You’re a person of rare intelligence.” “Intelligence” is how smart you are. “Rare” (rare) means unusual or n ot very common. Doris then says, “You rarely show any!” meaning you very infre quently, or not very often, have any intelligence. So Doris is trying to insult  Alan back by saying that he is not very smart.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alan: Look at you! Did you get a haircut or did you r head get stuck in a weed whacker?

Doris: Look who’s talking. Maybe you should do some thing different with your hair, like wash it.

Alan: Oh, burn. That would have been a nice comebac k if it weren’t so dumb. Who taught you your one-liners? A friend? Oh, I for got. You don’t have any.

Doris: I think you’ve confused me with someone else  – you!

Alan: You couldn’t come up with your own put-down s o you had to borrow mine? How humiliating for you.

Doris: Not as humiliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that’ll improve it: a paper bag!

Alan: Oh, clever. I knew better insults when I was six years old.

Doris: You mean the same mental age you are now?

Alan: Give it up. Nobody can one-up me in trading i nsults. Your brain is no match for mine.

Doris: You’re right. You’re a person of rare intell igence. You rarely show any!

# Diversifying a Workforce

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,300 – Diversifying a Workforce.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,300. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Audrey and Simon  about trying to get different kinds of people working at a company. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Audrey: Have you seen these design ideas? They’re s tale.

Simon: Maybe it’s time we diversified our workforce . It’s pretty homogenous right now.

Audrey: It’s not that homogeneous. We have people f rom different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multicult ural.

Simon: That’s not what I mean and you know it. We’r e missing a huge demographic. Having more diversity will help us fin d new ways to tackle problems and come up with creative ideas.

Audrey: Are you saying we’ve become stodgy? I’m not  adverse to change, you know.

Simon: I know that.

Audrey: But how will the rest of the company react?

Simon: I don’t know, but a more diverse workforce w ill also prevent discrimination lawsuits. That’s the reality we live in.

Audrey: I really don’t know. Do you really think hi ring more men to design women’s bras is a good idea?

Simon: Of course. We have a unique appreciation for  them.

[end of dialogue]

 Audrey begins our dialogue by asking Simon, “Have y ou seen these design ideas? They’re stale.” “Design” (design) is a plan for how something is going to look or the actual way that something looks, the fo rm it takes, perhaps the colors that are present. We’re not sure what Audrey is tal king about in terms of design here. It could be design for clothing. It could be design for a computer or a phone.

In any case, she says that the design ideas they ha ve are “stale” (stale). Here, “stale” means not new or not interesting. “Stale” i s used to mean outdated or perhaps old. Simon says, “Maybe it’s time we divers ified our workforce.” The “workforce” (workforce) is the group of people who work at a certain company. It could also refer to all of the people who work in a  given community or even in a certain country, but Simon I think is talking about  the people in this particular company.

Simon thinks “it’s time,” meaning the company shoul d think about diversifying the workforce. “To diversify” (diversify) means to have  more variety, more variations – different kinds of, in this case, people. We’re n ot sure exactly what Simon is talking about. He could be talking about people fro m different backgrounds, different experiences. I’m not sure if that will he lp their design ideas, but Simon thinks so.

He says, “It’s pretty homogenous right now.” “Homog enous” (homogenous) refers to something being all the same. If the work force is “homogenous,” everyone comes from the same kind of background or has the same experience, perhaps. Audrey says, “It’s not that homogenous,” m eaning we do have some different kinds of people working for us. “We have people from different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multi cultural.”

“Bilingual” (bilingual) means someone who can speak  two languages. The prefix “bi” (bi) means two, so “bilingual” is two language s. If someone spoke three languages, he would be “trilingual” – (tri), meanin g three. Someone who speaks more than three languages is usually called a “poly glot” (polyglot). Audrey says that their employees are also, at least some of the m, “multicultural.” “Multi” (multi) as a prefix means many, so representing many differ ent cultures or having experiences in many different cultures.

Simon says, “That’s not what I mean and you know it ,” meaning you know that’s not what I was saying. He says, “We’re missing a hu ge demographic.” The term “demographic” (demographic) here means a certain gr oup within the larger population. He says, “Having more diversity will he lp us find ways to tackle

problems and come up with creative ideas.” “To tack le (tackle) problems” means to deal with difficult situations – to solve diffic ult problems or find solutions to problems. “To tackle” means to take care of or to h andle. “Come up with” means to create or to invent.

Simon says that having more diversity in their work force will help them find new ways to “come up with creative (creative) ideas” – new and interesting ideas. Audrey says, “Are you saying that we’ve become stod gy?” “Stodgy” (stodgy) is similar to “stale.” It means old and boring, not in teresting or perhaps old fashioned. Audrey says, “I’m not adverse to change,  you know.” “To be adverse (adverse) to” something means not wanting to or bei ng interested in doing something – in this case, in changing.

Audrey says she’s not adverse to change. Simon says , “I know that.” Audrey responds, “But how will the rest of the company rea ct?” That is, what will other people think or say. Simon says, “I don’t know, but  a more diverse workforce will also prevent discrimination lawsuits.” “Discriminat ion” (discrimination) refers to not treating people equally, not doing the same thi ng for one group that you would do for another in a way that would generally be considered illegal or against the law.

A “lawsuit” (lawsuit) is when a legal case is broug ht against a company or individual by someone who thinks that he has been h armed by that other person, damaged in some way. Usually a lawsuit is over mone y. The person wants money in order to make up for some harm that he has  suffered because of what another person has done.

For example, if someone runs into your car with his  car and doesn’t want to pay for the damage – for the fact that your car no long er works, let’s say – you might bring a lawsuit against that person. You might go t o a judge and say, “This person has ruined my car. I want him to pay me mone y,” and you can use the government to help you force that person to pay you  money. That’s basically what a “lawsuit” is.

A “discrimination lawsuit,” then, would be someone who takes a company or a person to court and makes the court correct the pro blem, if you will, that might include giving that person money. Simon says, “That ’s the reality we live in,” meaning the world we live in is such that we need t o protect ourselves to prevent discrimination lawsuits. Audrey says, “I really don ’t know. Do you really think hiring more men to design women’s bras is a good id ea?”

Now we learn that Simon and Audrey work at a compan y that makes bras. A “bra” (bra) is something that a woman usually wears  under other clothing, under a shirt or a dress, that protects and supports her breasts, the two things that are found at the top of a woman’s body usually. I guess  men also have breasts, but we don’t normally think of them as wearing bras, th ough perhaps some of them should.

Anyway, Audrey is wondering whether getting more me n to work for the company will really be a good idea since the company makes bras for women. Simon says, “Of course. We,” meaning men, “have a unique apprec iation for them.” “Unique” (unique) is one of a kind, or unlike anything else.  “Appreciation” (appreciation) is an admiration for something or a feeling of pleasur e or respect for something or someone.

A “unique appreciation” here means that men, unlike  most women, are able to think about bras in a different way, perhaps. You p robably can understand why men might have a unique appreciation for bras.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Audrey: Have you seen these design ideas? They’re s tale.

Simon: Maybe it’s time we diversified our workforce . It’s pretty homogenous right now.

Audrey: It’s not that homogeneous. We have people f rom different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multicult ural.

Simon: That’s not what I mean and you know it. We’r e missing a huge demographic. Having more diversity will help us fin d new ways to tackle problems and come up with creative ideas.

Audrey: Are you saying we’ve become stodgy? I’m not  adverse to change, you know.

Simon: I know that.

Simon: Of course. We have a unique appreciation for  them.

# Describing Very Large and Small Sizes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,301 – Describing Very Large and Small Sizes.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,301. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Ian and Shannon about describing the size of something. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ian: Oh, look at your team. How cute! You’ve recrui ted the puniest players you could find.

Shannon: Are those your players? They’re humungous!

Ian: My players are the best around. They’re massiv e in size and massive in talent. They’ll crush your teeny-tiny team without breaking a sweat.

Shannon: Our teams are supposed to have players fro m the same age group, so why is it that I have normal-size players and yours  are gigantic? Something doesn’t smell right.

Ian: It all comes down to recruitment. I recruited the best players.

Shannon: Are you sure you don’t have a few ringers on your team, some who are a few years older than they’re supposed to be?

Ian: Of course I don’t. I can’t help it if the best  players gravitated toward my team and to my better coaching. Ready to be schooled?

Shannon: I think I’d better give my team a pep talk  first. A few of them look like they’re ready to bolt – or throw up!

[end of dialogue]

Ian begins our dialogue by saying to Shannon, “Oh, look at your team. How cute!” Normally the word “cute” is used to mean att ractive in some way, but here Ian is using it sarcastically – that is, he’s using  it in the opposite way we normally

do in order to be funny. He says, “You’ve recruited  the puniest players you could find.” We soon learn that Ian and Shannon are coach es, or managers of some sort of sports team.

Ian says to Shannon that she has “recruited the pun iest players.” “To recruit” (recruit) means to get someone to participate in an  organization, a company, or – as is the case in our dialogue – a team. “To recrui t” someone means to go and try to persuade that person to join your group. Ian  says that Shannon has “recruited the puniest (puniest) players.” “Puniest ” is the superlative form of “puny” (puny), which means very small and weak. “Pu ny” would describe a person or perhaps an animal who was, or that was, v ery small and weak.

Shannon asks, “Are those your players? They’re humu ngous!” “Humungous” (humungous) is a funny sounding word that means ext remely large. We might also say “huge” (huge). A “humongous player” would be someone who’s very tall and perhaps muscular or strong. Ian says, “My playe rs are the best around,” meaning the best anywhere. “They’re massive in size  and massive in talent.” Something that is “massive” (massive) is something that is very large, very big, perhaps also very heavy – something that weighs a l ot.

Ian says his players are “massive in size,” meaning  how big they are, “and massive in talent,” meaning how good they are at wh at they do, how good they are as players of this game. He says, “They’ll,” me aning his players, “crush your teeny-tiny team without breaking a sweat.” “Crush” (crush) as a verb means to destroy or to ruin something. In this case, however , it means to win a competition by a large score, or to beat another team very badl y so that you win with a much higher score than the other team.

Ian says his players will crush Shannon’s “teeny-ti ny team.” “Teeny (teeny) – tiny (tiny)” means very small. The word “tiny” by itself  means extremely small. So, “teeny-tiny” means really, really, really small. It ’s not a common term, “teeny- tiny,” but you will hear people use it to describe something that is very, very small. Ian is describing Shannon’s team as “teeny-t iny.”

He says his players will beat them “without breakin g (breaking) a sweat (sweat).” “Sweat” is the water or the liquid that comes out of your body when you are very hot, perhaps because you are working a lot. “To bre ak a sweat” means to start sweating because you are working a lot, you are wor king hard. Ian is saying that his team will beat Shannon’s team “without breaking  a sweat,” meaning that they won’t have to work very hard because they are so mu ch better than Shannon’s team.

Shannon says, “Our teams are supposed to have playe rs from the same age group,” meaning about the same age. “So why is it that I ha ve normal-size players and yours are gigantic?” “Gigantic” (gigantic) means ve ry large, huge. It means the same in this case as “humungous” or “massive.” Shan non is wondering why, if the players on their teams are supposed to be about  the same age, why Ian’s players are so much bigger than hers.

She says, “Something doesn’t smell right.” The expr ession “Something doesn’t smell (smell) right” means something is suspicious.  The verb “to smell” is normally used to talk about the ability to detect o r to sense the odor of something using your nose. Your nose smells; your eyes see. B ut when someone says, “Something doesn’t smell right,” he means there’s s omething wrong with this situation. There’s something suspicious about what is happening here, something isn’t right.

Ian says, “It all comes down to recruitment.” The e xpression for something “to come down to” something else means it is a simple e xplanation, or the main reason something is true is because of this or that . We could say, for example, “Doing well at school comes down to studying hard,”  or doing all of the reading required. That would be the simplest explanation for why or how something is successful.

Ian says his success, the reason he has such big pl ayers, “comes down to recruitment.” “Recruitment” is the noun that comes from the verb “to recruit.” He means that he went out and got the best players. He  says, “I recruited the best players.” Shannon asks, “Are you sure you don’t hav e a few ringers on your team?” A “ringer” (ringer) is usually an athlete, s omeone who plays a sport, who is not eligible or shouldn’t actually be on that te am, usually because the player is too old to be on that team.

If you want to play basketball with your friends an d you brought a professional basketball player with you as a member of your team , the other team would say, “Well, he’s a ringer.” He doesn’t belong here. He’s , in this case, not qualified because he’s obviously not the same level or he’s n ot at the same level as the rest of the players. Ian says, “Of course I don’t,”  meaning I don’t have any players here who are ringers.

It does happen in American sports – in amateur spor ts, especially for children and teenagers – that some teams try to get players who are actually too old to be on that particular team. Ian says he’s not doing th at. He says, “I can’t help it,” meaning it’s not my fault or I’m not to blame, “if the best players gravitated

toward my team and to my better coaching.” The expr ession “to gravitate (gravitate) toward” something means to be intereste d in and want to have something to do with – or in this case, want to joi n this team.

He says the best players went to his team and to hi s “better coaching.” “To coach” (coach) means to give instructions to anothe r person to help that person do something better. That’s often used to describe the leader of the team – that’s the coach. He or she is the person who doesn’t play  on the team but helps the team be a better team, tells the team what to do.

Nowadays we use this term “coach” outside of the wo rld of sports. You could have a “business coach” or a “podcast coach” – some one who helps you do better what you want to do. Ian says then to Shanno n, “Ready to be schooled?” “To be schooled” means to be taught a lesson. Often  it is used to mean to be shown in a somewhat aggressive way how you are wron g, or to be proven wrong.

Shannon says, “I think I’d better give my team a pe p talk first.” A “pep (pep) talk” is when you talk to your team to try to get them mo re excited about playing, to motivate them. In American high schools, often befo re a big game, an important game such as a football game, the entire school wil l come together and have what’s called a “pep rally” (rally).

My high school used to have these every year. The p ep rally would be all of the students coming together in the gym and the athleti c team would be there and we would all yell and shout and try to give the tea m motivation to play well in that game, whatever it was. It sounds a little silly, bu t it is quite common in American high schools, or at least it used to be. Also quite  common is a coach giving a pep talk to his team to get them motivated.

Shannon wants to give a pep talk to her team. She s ays, “A few of them look like they’re ready to bolt – or throw up!” “To bolt” (bo lt) means to run away quickly and suddenly. Perhaps Shannon’s players are afraid of Ian’s team’s players. She says some look like they’re ready to bolt, and some  look like they’re ready “to throw up.” “To throw up” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning here “to vomit” – for the contents or what’s inside of your stomach to co me out through your mouth. If you’re very scared, of course, that might happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ian: Oh, look at your team. How cute! You’ve recrui ted the puniest players you could find.

Shannon: Are those your players? They’re humungous!

Ian: My players are the best around. They’re massiv e in size and massive in talent. They’ll crush your teeny-tiny team without breaking a sweat.

Shannon: Our teams are supposed to have players fro m the same age group, so why is it that I have normal-size players and yours  are gigantic? Something doesn’t smell right.

Ian: It all comes down to recruitment. I recruited the best players.

Shannon: Are you sure you don’t have a few ringers on your team, some who are a few years older than they’re supposed to be?

Ian: Of course I don’t. I can’t help it if the best  players gravitated toward my team and to my better coaching. Ready to be schooled?

Shannon: I think I’d better give my team a pep talk  first. A few of them look like they’re ready to bolt – or throw up!
