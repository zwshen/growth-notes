This episode is called “Formatting Text.”  It’s a dialogu e between Chad and Pamela that is going to be using a lot of vocabulary tha t you might need when talking about preparing a formal document on a word processing program such as Microsoft Word.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chad:  Okay, this report is finally finished.

Pamela:  Oh, not quite.  I’m still working on the for matting.

Chad:  We used the standard formatting for this type of  report.  I don’t think we should play around with the text.

Pamela:  Standard is boring.  I want our report to b e special.  I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shading, and centering some of the text.

Chad:  No, I really think that’s a bad idea.  All of t he text should be flush left, and nobody else puts shading in their reports.  It cuts down on readability.

Pamela:  Readability is secondary to presentation.  Look, I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bu llets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.  This will al l make each page look more professional.

Chad:  I don’t think it’s going to have your intended e ffect.

 Pamela:  Really?

Chad:  Yes, instead of thinking we’re being professional , they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.

Pamela:  Don’t be so stodgy.  Hey, I think adding some cli p art would really jazz things up, don’t you?

Chad:  Oh, God!

Chad begins our dialogue by saying to Pamela, “Okay, this report is finished.”  A “report” is a document that summarizes some information about a particular topic, often as a result of research on that topic.  Pame la says, “Oh, not quite (meaning no, it isn’t finished yet – not quite).  I’m  still working on the formatting.” The “formatting” is the ways that words are printed or displayed in electronic documents; it’s the visible style of the words, how they appear on the page. Chad says, “We used the standard formatting for this type of report.”  “Standard” in many business uses typically means the basic, ordinary, normal, expected type of whatever it is you’re talking about.  So, the “ standard formatting” would be the formatting that their company always uses for these kinds of reports.  Chad says, “I don’t think we should play around with the text .”  “To play around” is a phrasal verb which here means to change without really ne eding to change. “Play around” can often just mean to look at something  closely to try different options.  In this case, it’s used somewhat as a negative to mean that it’s a waste of time.  The “text” are the written words, what you have actually written.

Pamela says, “Standard is boring.”  Standard formatting , she means, is boring; it’s not interesting.  She says, “I want our report to be special (to be different). I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shad ing, and centering some of the text.”  A “border” is a line or some sort of ar tistic design that goes around text or other images, usually it is rectangular in shape.  It’s like a big box that goes around everything else, often a black line.  “Shadi ng” is gray area behind the text – behind the writing or behind objects.  It’s often used for emphasis.  You might make a certain sentence gray, meaning that the ba ckground is gray but the actual type – the actual text is still in black in order to emphasize a particular sentence.  Usually in black and white documents shading is w hat we call the color between black and white, which is gray.  “Shading” has a couple of other meanings however, and those can be found only in our Lea rning Guide.  “To center” (center) means to put the text on the page so th at each sentence is in the

 middle of the page or the middle of the area.  When  you center your text there isn’t a line – a vertical line at the left or right si des of the paragraph.  The paragraph is oddly shaped; each side, both the left and  the right side are going to be slightly different because the sentences are in the mid dle of the page. Sometimes we use this for poetry or perhaps for special i nvitations.  That’s to center.

Well, Pamela wants to put a nice border on the cover, a dd some shading, and center some of the text.  Chad says, “No, I think that’s a  bad idea,” and Pamela says, “Chad, I think you’re ugly!”  No, she doesn’t say that !  Chad continues, “All of the text should be flush left, and nobody else puts sh ading in the reports.”  To be “flush left” means to be immediately next to the lef t hand side of the page. Basically it means that all of the sentences begin on the same vertical line on the left side of the page.  To be “flush right” means that  all of the sentences are on a vertical line on the right side of the page.  Finally, the third possibility, other than centering, is to be justified.  Text that is “justified”  (justified) is text that has two lines, one on the left, one on the right, and all of  the sentences reach those two lines.  So, there are two straight lines of text on the  left and the right if you look at the page.  Most books are written either flush left or justified; you don’t often see a long document flush right or centered.

Chad thinks all the text should be flush left, and says th at to put shading in the report cuts down on readability.  “To cut down on (somet hing)” is a phrasal verb meaning it reduces, it lessens, it makes it less.  In th is case, it makes it less readable because it cuts down on readability.  “Readabi lity” is how easy it is to read something, both because of the words – the grammar , the vocabulary – as well as the way they appear on the page.  You want thi ngs to be very readable in terms of the appearance of the text.

Pamela says, “Readability is secondary to presentation.”  “Secondary” means it is not as important as, or is second most important, but t he most important is presentation.  “Presentation” is the way that you show so mething or share something with other people.  “Presentation” is often also used to mean a speech or a talk in front of a group of people.  Here, howe ver, it mean simply the way that something looks when you give it to someone else.

Pamela says, “Look (meaning I want you to listen to me) , I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bu llets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.”  Several for matting terms there, let’s start with “caps” (caps).  “Caps” refers to – or is short for capital letters.  We sometimes call these upper-case letters; they are the larg e form of the letter.

 You also have lower-case letters; these are smaller form s of the letters.  So in English, sentences always begin with a capital letter.  the first letter, in other words, is in caps – that is, a capital letter.  To put a n entire word in caps would mean to capitalize the entire word, all of the lette rs are upper case.  “To underline” means to put a usually black horizontal line underneath, or below a sentence.  A “bullet” (bullet) in formatting is a small  mark, often a round circle that is used at the beginning of each item in a list.  You o ften will see what are called “bullet points.”  Bullet points are the same as bullet s; they are usually small white or black circles that go in front of a list of things – e ach item, each thing on that list.  “Bullet” has other meanings in English as well,  and those can be found in the Learning Guide.  If you don’t know them, you might wa nt to learn them because it could save your life!  “Bold” (bold) are letters that are thicker and darker than the other letters around them, usually we use this to emphasi ze a particular word, to make it, we would say, “stand out,” to make it noticeabl e.  Finally, Pamela talks about italics.  “Italics” is when the letters are printe d at an angle so that it looks more like handwriting.  Again, this is used for emphasis.

So Pamela says that she’s going to put some of the titles in caps and underline them, she’s going to add some bullets or some bullet p oints, and she’s going to put some of the important sections in bold or italics.  “ This will all make each page more professional,” she says.  Chad says, “I don’t thi nk it’s going to have your intended effect.”  The “intended effect” is the re sult that you want to achieve; is what you plan to do or hope to have happen as a resu lt of your actions.  If you walk up to a beautiful woman in a bar and you say to h er, “Do you come here often?” the intended effect is for her to start a conver sation with you.  However, the more probable effect is for her to ignore you or turn the other way.  Well, at least that’s what always used to happen to me!

Chad doesn’t think Pamela’s changes are good ones.  Pam ela says, “Really?” Chad replies, “Yes, instead of thinking we’re being pro fessional, they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.”  The expression “to go off yo ur rocker” (rocker), or “to be off your rocker” means to be crazy, to not be able to  think clearly or rationally, to be nuts.  A “rocker” is a word for a “rocking chair, ” which is a chair that has instead of regular legs two semi-circles, almost like part s of a circle, that you can move the chair back and forth easily.  This is sometimes a ki nd of chair we associate in the United States with old people – with e lderly people, who it is sometimes thought don’t always think rationally because the y’re old and their brains are old.  This is certainly true of my old brain!  Well, that’s the association then, the rocker is an old person who may be a little cr azy.  I suppose “to be off your rocker” means that you are up and out of your rockin g chair and causing problems somewhere else.

 In any case, Pamela says to Chad, “Don’t be so stodgy (stodg y).”  “To be stodgy” means to be very old-fashioned, to think the way people  thought 50 years ago or 100 years ago.  It can also mean to be unwilling or u nable to accept new ideas, new ways of doing things.  Pamela says, “Hey, I think ad ding some clip art would really jazz things up, don’t you?”  “Clip (clip) art” (t wo words) refers to small electronic drawings or other images that you can put in electronic documents, like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, that some people thi nk will make the presentation, the way it looks, more interesting.  When personal computers first started to become popular in the 80s and 90s it was very common to see people putting clip art in all sorts of things, including on we b pages.  I think that has become less popular, thankfully, now.

Pamela wants to put some clip art in order to jazz thing s up.  “To jazz (something) up” means to make it more exciting, to make it more interesting. Pamela says, “I think adding some clip art would really ja zz things up, don’t you?” Chad doesn’t agree, he simply says, “Oh, God!” meaning he  doesn’t agree at all.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

I apologize for our episode going a little long today.   Who knew formatting text could be so fascinating?!  Well, Lucy Tse – Dr. Lucy Tse to yo u – knows, and we thank her for her efforts.
