<H1 align="center">Water Flow</H1>
</font>

<P align="justify">
The following figure represents a succession of water deposits installed 
downhill on a mountainside. Every deposit (except the last one) is connected 
with the next in line via a pipe. All deposits are equal but the pipes can have 
different specifications (such as diameter, material quality), and therefore, 
some may sustain greater flows of water than others.

                     +-----------+ 
                     | Deposit A |  Pipe a      +-----------+
                     | 11 liters |o============o| Deposit B |  Pipe b      +-----------+
                     +-----------+  5 liters    | 0 liters  |o============o| Deposit C |
                                    per second  +-----------+  4 liters    | 0 liters  |
                                    (maximum)                  per second  +-----------+
                                                               (maximum)</pre>

<P align="justify">
Due to the influence of gravity, and assuming there are no water leaks and 
that the pipes are unobstructed, after some time all the water will flow to the 
deposit that stands lowest on the mountainside ('C' in the previous figure). For 
example, under the conditions depicted above, after 4 seconds all 11 liters that 
initially were in deposit 'A' will have gone through deposit 'B' and be resting 
inside deposit 'C' - just watch what happens:</p>

<P align="justify">
You are now invited to build a simulator that determines not only how much 
time is needed for all water to end up in the last deposit, but also to explain 
how did that happen, much the same as shown immediately above.</p>

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

The input has exactly three lines:

<P align="justify">
<ul>
  <li>Line 1 contains the number of water deposits on the mountainside. For example, <code>N=3</code> indicates the simulation will 
  have 3 water deposits (and therefore two water pipes).</li>
  <li>Line 2 describes the initial contents of each water deposit, from the 
  topmost to the lowest one. For example, <code>A=11;B=0;C=0</code> states that 
  deposit 'A' (topmost) initially has 11 liters of water and that both 
  remaining deposits ('B' and 'C') are empty at the beginning of the simulation.</li>
  <li>Line 3 indicates the maximum flow of water allowed inside the pipes that 
  connect each pair of deposits, 
  respecting the order imposed in the previous line. For example, <code>a=5;b=4</code> 
  means the maximum flow between deposits 'A' and 'B' (pipe 'a') is 5 
  liters/second, and that between 'B' and 'C' (pipe 'b') it is 4 liters/second. 
  Note, however, that the flow at an instant of time can be less than the 
  maximum if the deposit contains insufficient water - a particular case is the 
  empty deposit which disables the flow (see above examples).</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All numbers (seconds, liters, and liters/second) are non-negative integers 
  with a maximum value of 999.</li>
  <li>There must be at least two water deposits.</li>
  <li>The maximum flow of water inside pipes is always greater than zero (all 
  pipes are unobstructed).</li>
  <li>Water deposits are represented by a single uppercase letter, starting with 
  'A' then 'B' and so on.</li>
  <li>Pipes are identified by a single lowercase letter, beginning with 'a' then 
  'b' and so on.</li>
</ul>

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
The output is a table that displays the contents of all water deposits for 
each second that passes since the initial instant until all water is resting 
inside the last deposit (which is guaranteed to happen in no more than 999 
seconds). The table has a line for 
the header, a separator line, and multiple lines of data - one line for each 
second of the simulation, including the initial instant (at zero seconds). The 
columns of the table vary with the number of water deposits, but the first one 
is always reserved for the elapsed time. See the sample output (below) for an 
example of a table built according to the simulation specified in the previous 
section.</p>

Notes:

<P align="justify">
<ul>
  <li>All table columns have a width of three characters.</li>
  <li>Every pair of columns is separated by a single space character.</li>
  <li>All numbers are right justified (see sample output).</li>
  <li>Watch out for the lowercase 't' (elapsed time column).</li>
</ul>
