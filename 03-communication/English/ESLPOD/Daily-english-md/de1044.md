This episode is all about apologies. An “apology” ( apology) is when you say that you have done something wrong. Often, an apology is  asking for the forgiveness of the person or people that you have harmed or inj ured. We apologize for things we do wrong – at least, we should, but not everybod y does.  

In our story, the person is involved or working in public relations. “Public relations” (relations) refers to an area of work, a  professional field where people try to improve how companies and individuals are se en by the general public. “Public relations” is involved in protecting the re putation and the image of a company or of an individual.  

“Working in public relations,” I say, “I often have  to deal with my clients’ gaffes and blunders.” A “gaffe” (gaffe) is a small mistake , especially when you have said something that is wrong or perhaps have hurt someon e. A “blunder” (blunder) is a small mistake or error – usually some action that  has been taken. A gaffe is usually something that someone has said. A blunder is often something that someone has done, although you could use “blunder” for something that you said, as well. A blunder often causes you embarrass ment and requires that you apologize. 

“My job,” according to the story, “is to calm any f irestorm before it gets out of hand.” A “firestorm” (firestorm) is a major problem , something that attracts a lot of negative attention, a lot of criticism. The word “f irestorm” is used often in business to talk about a big problem, or in politic s to talk about some controversy – something that happened that everyone is talking about and that perhaps may require someone to apologize for.  

The expression “to get out of hand” means to become  out of control. It refers to a problem that has become so big that it is impossibl e to solve it. We sometimes say that a situation is “getting out of hand,” mean ing the situation is getting worse and we won’t be able to control it or fix it if we allow it to continue to grow, to continue to get bigger.  

The job of the public relations department in a com pany is to “calm any firestorm before it gets out of hand.” “To calm” (calm) means  to stop or to end or to make less serious. “To calm a firestorm” would be to tak e a situation where there’s a lot of negative publicity, a lot of negative reaction, and try to end that negative reaction by doing something to stop the situation f rom getting out of hand, from growing and becoming worse.  

I continue by saying, “One of the most important th ings to do whenever there’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology.” A “mi sstep” (misstep) – one word – is a mistake. It’s an error. It’s something that yo u did or said that was wrong. Usually a “misstep” is not a serious situation, but  it could be.  

A “public apology” is when you make a statement and  you send it to the newspapers and to the magazines and to the televisi on stations so that  

everybody knows that you’re apologizing. A “private  apology” would be when you say you’re sorry to someone individually, without o ther people knowing about it, or at least without the newspapers reporting it.  

“An apology should say plainly and clearly that the  individual or company is sorry,” I say. “Plainly” (plainly) means the same a s clearly. “To say something plainly” is to be very direct, to be very explicit,  without any sort of hidden message. “Plainly” and “clearly,” then, really mean  the same thing here. 

The apology should say that the individual or the c ompany is sorry. “To be sorry” means that you feel badly about what you have done.  You regret something you have done. I also say that when a company apologize s, it should take responsibility for its actions. “To take responsibi lity for” something is to say that you are the person who caused this to happen or you  are the person to blame if something goes wrong related to this particular act ion or situation. When you take responsibility for something, you say “I am th e person to blame. If there is a problem, it’s my fault.”  

I continue, “If possible, the apology should outlin e corrective actions that will be taken.” The word “corrective” (corrective) comes fr om the word “correct,” which means to change or fix the situation so that this i s working better or that it is the way it should be. “Corrective actions” would be thi ngs that a company does to fix the problem that it has caused.  

“The key,” I continue, “is to come clean, apologize , and take the blame.” The phrasal verb “to come clean” means to admit that yo u’ve done something wrong – not to hide the fact that you made a mistake. “To  take the blame” (blame) means the same as to accept responsibility or to ta ke responsibility for something that has gone wrong.  

So, according to our story, when a company makes a mistake, it should “come clean, apologize, and take the blame,” and it shoul d do so “quickly and without hesitation.” “Hesitation” is when you pause or dela y before doing something. The verb is “to hesitate” (hesitate). “To hesitate” is to stop and not do something, or to pause before you do something. The story says you s hould not hesitate if you’ve made a mistake, but instead you should apologize ri ght away.  

“I give my clients,” I continue, “this advice every  time they land themselves in a mess.” Your “clients” are the people for whom you d o work. “To land yourself in a mess” (mess) means to do something that creates a d ifficult situation for yourself – to do something that causes problems. If you land  yourself in a mess at work, you’ve done something that has caused problems for you and perhaps might  

even hurt your chances of continuing to work at the  company. So, it’s a major problem.  

The word “mess” is often used to describe a large o r difficult or complex problem that someone has caused or created. In the story, I  say that I give my advice to my clients every time they land themselves, or get themselves, in a mess, but the smart ones listen, and the not-so-smart ones don’t listen.  

“Many of my clients,” I say, “are still trying to s alvage their reputations and to bounce back.” Your “reputation” is what other peopl e think about you – your “public image,” we might say. “To salvage” (salvage ) your reputation is to improve your reputation, especially when you have a  very bad reputation. “To salvage” anything is to take it and fix it and make  it better so that you can continue using it.  

“To salvage a reputation” would be to take a negati ve or bad reputation and try to make it more positive. “To bounce back” is a two wo rd phrasal verb meaning to recover from a difficult situation, to return to a good condition after having been in a bad condition. If something goes wrong for you, i f something causes you difficulty, it’s important to bounce back to do bet ter the next time – to keep trying to improve your situation. 

I say that many of my clients don’t listen to me an d I try very hard not to say “I told you so.” The phrase “I told you so” is used to  emphasize that you were correct about something. Usually we use this phrase  when you tell someone to do something and they don’t do it, and then somethi ng bad happens to them and we say, “Well, I told you so,” meaning “I told you not to do this,” or “I told you to do it and you didn’t, and now you have problems or difficulties.”  

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a nativ e speed.  

[start of story] 

Working in public relations, I often have to deal w ith my clients’ gaffes and blunders. My job is to calm any firestorm before it  gets out of hand. 

One of the most important things to do whenever the re’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology. An apology should say plain ly and clearly that the individual or company is sorry and that it takes re sponsibility for its actions. If possible, the apology should outline corrective act ions that will be taken. The key is to come clean, apologize, and take the blame, an d to do so quickly and without hesitation.   

 I give my clients this advice every time they land themselves in a mess, but do they listen to me? The smarts ones do.  

And the others? Many of them are still trying to sa lvage their reputations and to bounce back. And me? I try very hard not to say, “I  told you so.”
