<P>
People of Babylon were devoted to chance games and one of the most popular was a special kind of roulette. Recently, some old Babylonian tablets were found. They described details of the roulette game. 

<P>
In modern terms, the rules of the game were as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Roulette's compartments had only six labels: <TT>-1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>The game was played by turns, during a day. Turns were numerated <TT>0, 1, 2, ...</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Players could win or lose a multiple of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bet</SPAN>, a quantity of money that was constant along the day.
</LI>
<LI>At turn <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>t</I></SPAN> there was an amount of money <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>t</SUB></SPAN>, called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pot</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>At the start, there was an initial amount of money <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> in the pot. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN> and the bet were positive numbers arbitrarily defined by the King. 
</LI>
<LI>In a turn, a player turned the roulette. A player could not play more than once in a day. Depending on the compartment where the ball came to rest, the player lose (or won, if the value was negative) an amount <!-- MATH
 $w_{t} = L * bet$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I><SUB>t</SUB> = <I>L</I>*<I>bet</I></SPAN> of money, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> corresponded to the compartment's label.
</LI>
<LI>The won money was taken from the pot (or put in it if the player lose), i.e. the value of the pot in a given turn was determined by <!-- MATH
 $P_{t+1} = P_{t} + w_{t}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>t+1</SUB> = <I>P</I><SUB>t</SUB> + <I>w</I><SUB>t</SUB></SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>If as a result of the last rule <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><SUB>t+1</SUB></SPAN> was a negative number the winner won only the maximum multiple of the bet that he could win without making a negative pot.   
</LI>
<LI>If at some turn the pot was less than the bet, the game was ended for that day. If that was not the case the game continued till sunset.
</LI>
</UL> 

<P>
Beside the tablets that explained the rules some other tablets were found. These had lines with three  numbers. Archeologists conjecture that each of these lines were part of a kind of accountability system for the game, where numbers represented, for a given day, the value of the pot at the beginning, the bet and the value of the pot at the end.

<P>
For example, a line with the numbers
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
<TT>10000 1500 11500</TT>

</DIV>

<P>
could mean that there was only one turn where the player lose with label <TT>1</TT>. Another possibility is that there were three turns with results <TT>2</TT>, <TT>1</TT> and <TT>-2</TT>. 

<P>
On the other hand, there were found other tablets with triplets of numbers that seem like the above described that, however, cannot represent results of a game day. There is no hypothesis of what they are.  

<P>
Archeologists want to validate their hypothesis analyzing batches of tablets with triplets. They want to 
estimate the number of people that played in a day. To begin, they want to establish, for each triplet of numbers in a tablet that could represent a result of a game day, the minimal number of players that played that day. In the above example the answer to this question is <TT>1</TT>. Tablets that cannot represent results should be identified. You are hired to help with this task.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input file contains several test cases, each one of them in a separate line. 
Each test case is a triplet of non negative integers, indicating the initial pot, the bet and the final pot for a day. Each of the input numbers is less than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>8</SUP></SPAN>. The initial pot and the bet are greater than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0</SPAN>. 

<P>
A line with a triplet of <TT>0</TT>'s denotes the end of the input.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Output texts for each input case are presented in the same order that input is read. For each test case the answer must be a printed line.

<P>
If the test case cannot represent the result of a game day, the output line has the words <TT>No accounting tablet</TT>. In other case, the printed answer is one positive integer number telling the minimal number of players that could turn the roulette for the day corresponding to the annotations.
