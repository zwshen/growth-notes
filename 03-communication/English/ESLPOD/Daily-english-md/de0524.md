This episode is called “Talking About Failure.”  It’s a d ialogue between Akiko and Gerry using vocabulary that we would employ – that we wou ld use when talking about things that go wrong – things that fail.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Akiko:  How did your presentation go over this morning a t the meeting?   

Gerry:  It was a complete flop! 

Akiko:  I don’t believe it.  You spent weeks working on t hat presentation.   

Gerry:  It wasn’t the presentation that bombed.  It w as my big idea.  Leona called it a retread of what I presented last year, and she wa s not in the least impressed.   

Akiko:  Ouch, that’s pretty harsh.  What did the others sa y? 

Gerry:  Overall, the response was dismal.  Everyone else  was trying to be tactful, but it boiled down to the fact that they thought it w as pathetic.   

Akiko:  I’m sure that’s not true.  And if they didn’t ju mp up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around after y ou give them more details.   

Gerry:  I don’t know… 

Akiko:  Come on, aren’t you the same guy who told me th at you didn’t know the meaning of the word “quit”?    

 Gerry:  That was before this morning’s presentation.   

Akiko:  Are you giving up on your great idea? 

Gerry:  No, I guess not, but it’ll take some reworking… 

Akiko:  Good, then you won’t give up? 

Gerry:  I guess not.  What the heck?  I’m only risking more  humiliation and failure, right? 

Akiko:  That’s the spirit! 

[end of dialogue] 

Akiko begins by asking Gerry, “How did your presentation go over this morning at the meeting?”  The phrasal verb “to go over” here mea ns how did people like it, how was it received – did people think it was good or b ad?  Something that “goes over well” is something that is good.  Something that “ goes over poorly,” obviously, is something that is bad.  So, we use this expre ssion “to go over” when we’re talking about a presentation, perhaps a per formance; it might also be used in asking someone about something that they told some body that might have been difficult for them to accept: “I told my boss I  was leaving in two weeks. That didn’t go over very well.”  He didn’t like it; he  didn’t receive the news very well. 

Gerry says his presentation was a complete flop (flop).  “ Flop” is a slightly informal way of saying “failure,” something that didn’t  work as you planned, something that didn’t work correctly.  Again, usually use d to describe a performance of some sort or a presentation.  We might sa y, “The movie was a flop,” we mean the movie was a failure, nobody liked it , it wasn’t popular, it didn’t make any money. 

Akiko says, “I don’t believe it.  You spent weeks working on that presentation.” Akiko doesn’t think it was a flop.  Gerry, however, insists,  “It wasn’t the presentation that bombed.”  “To bomb” in this context m eans to fail, when some event or project doesn’t work as well as you had hoped.  O nce again, we can use the example of a movie: “The movie bombed.”  It means it wasn’t very successful.  A television show, a performance, a comedy rou tine (somebody telling jokes) – those are all things that can bomb.  Bo th the word “bomb” and  

 “flop” have different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those two terms. 

Gerry says that the presentation didn’t bomb, it was his big idea.  In other words, it wasn’t the way he presented it, it was what he was sayi ng – the content, the idea behind his presentation.  “Leona called it a ret read of what I presented last year.”  A “retread,” here, means something that is repe ated from a previous project or a previous idea; it’s usually an insulting term  – a negative term saying that it wasn’t original.  Gerry says that Leona was not in the least impressed. “Not in the least” means not at all, not even a littl e bit: “Are you enjoying your new job?” and you say, “Not in the least.  It’s horrible, an d I want to quit.”  That’s usually what I say when I start a new job!   

Akiko says, “Ouch, that’s pretty harsh.”  When someone says “ouch ” in a situation like this they mean oh, that must hurt.  “Ouch”  is a word we use to express pain.  Somebody punches you or you hit your arm on t he door, you might say “Ouch!”  It’s when something hurts.  Well, this comment of Leona’s certainly hurt Gerry.  Akiko says, “Ouch, that’s pretty harsh. ”  “Harsh,” in this case, means very negative, perhaps rude, something that is ve ry direct.  If you go up to a man and say, “Excuse me, you’re really ugly,” w ell, that’s pretty harsh! 

Gerry says that the response, overall, from the other peop le at the presentation was dismal.  “Dismal” (dismal) means not good, very bad, depressing, negative. You might describe the weather as dismal, or you might describe a book as dismal.  Gerry says that everyone else was trying to be tactf ul.  “To be tactful” (tactful) means to be very polite, to tell someone some thing with a lot of respect, but usually it’s bad news.  You’re criticizing someone; you ’re saying something bad about them, but you’re trying to be nice about it  – you’re trying to say it in a nice way.  That’s being tactful.  Gerry says that it boiled  down to the fact that they thought his idea was pathetic.  “To boil down to (somet hing)” means to be the same as something else, to give a summary of something, to get down to the very necessary – the important details of something.  You m ay have lots of different reasons for buying a new car, but you probabl y have one or two reasons that are most important.  So if you take away all the other ideas – all the other things you could consider, these are the things that are t he most important.  So, that’s what it means to boil down to: “I like the color  of the car, I like the seats, but it boils down to the price; that’s the most important t hing.”  It’s the most essential element. 

Gerry said that it boiled down to the fact that they th ought his idea was pathetic (pathetic).  Something that is “pathetic” make you feel  sad because it is such a sad, useless thing.  It’s something that deserves your sympat hy.  Something that  

 is pathetic is so bad that you feel sorry for the person wh o’s doing it or who’s experiencing it.  That was how bad Gerry’s idea was, I gu ess.  We’re not told what his idea was. 

Akiko says, “I’m sure that’s not true.  And if they didn’t jump up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around afte r you give them more details.”  When you say somebody “jumps up and down about  (something),” you mean they’re very excited about something.  “To be bound  to” means to be certain to happen, something that is very likely going to happen.  What Akiko is saying here is that even though the other people at Ger ry’s presentation weren’t excited about it, they didn’t jump up and down right away, they’re bound to come around after you give them more details.  They’re very li kely to come around. “To come around,” here, means to finally agree with som eone even if you had a different opinion originally: My wife asked me to wear a green shirt because she thinks it looks good on me; I’ll don’t like the idea, bu t finally I come around to it.  I decide okay, I’ll wear the green shirt.  I’ll wear anyth ing my wife tells me to wear, that’s the way it works!  So here, Akiko is saying that the  people are going to eventually like this idea once they get more details – mo re specific information about it. 

Gerry says, “I don’t know,” he’s doubtful.  Akiko tries to cheer him up – tries to make him happy by saying, “Come on, aren’t you the same g uy (the same man) who told me that you didn’t know the meaning of the word ‘quit’?”  The expression “he didn’t know the meaning of the word…” and  then you put in the word, is a common one to say that a person is the opposit e of whatever that word is.  So if Gerry doesn’t know the meaning of the word “quit,” that means he’s never going to quit; he’s going to continue on, the o pposite of quitting. 

Gerry says that that was before this morning’s presentatio n, meaning that’s what he said before he made the presentation but he no lon ger thinks that.  Akiko says, “Are you giving up on your great idea?”  “To give up ” means to abandon, to say okay, I’m not going to do that anymore.  Gerry says, “No , I guess not, but it’ll take some reworking.”  “To rework (something)” means to i mprove it, to revise it because it’s not good enough yet.  Akiko says, “Good, then you won’t give up?” and Gerry says, “I guess not.  What the heck?”  The expression  “what the heck” is a phrase used to show that you plan on doing something  even though it might not be successful: I’m not a very good bowler – I don’t kn ow how to bowl, but what the heck, I’m going to play a game with my friend because it’s fun, even though I’m going to do a bad job at it – what the h eck.   

So, Gerry says, “What the heck?  I’m only risking more hum iliation and failure, right?”  “Humiliation” is when you are very embarrassed b y something or  

 someone.  So, Gerry is saying well, I’m probably not goin g to succeed – I’m probably going to fail, but I’m going to try anyway.  Of course, it’s not a good thing to think about being humiliated, so Gerry is kind  of joking here.  Akiko says, “That’s the spirit!”  “That’s the spirit” is normally an expression we use to encourage someone else, to make them have the right at titude.  But here, and often now, it’s used sarcastically; that is, Akiko’s making a j oke.  Gerry doesn’t seem to be very enthusiastic about his plan; he thinks it’s g oing to cause him to fail, and Akiko is making fun of his negative view, saying, “Oh, that’s the spirit,” when, of course, she means the opposite.  That’s not the spirit – that’s not the attitude that he should have. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
