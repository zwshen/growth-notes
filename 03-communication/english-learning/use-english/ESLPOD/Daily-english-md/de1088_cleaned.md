In this episode, we have a dialogue between Andy an d Robin about selling a business. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Andy: I can’t believe you’re really selling up. I t hought you’d stick it out for another year. 

Robin: Business has been slow for three years runni ng and I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon. I’m selling this bu siness now before it’s completely worthless. 

Andy: You should get a good price with all that equ ipment and inventory. 

Robin: I’m hoping that my valuation is in line with  what buyers want to pay. I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my consulting servic es as part of the deal. I’ll introduce the new owners to my suppliers and client s, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operations. 

Andy: That should give them a jump-start. With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope that business is better there. 

Robin: I couldn’t do that. The sales contract has a  non-compete clause. That’s only fair. 

Andy: I guess. What are you going to do now? 

Robin: I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of the s ale, I might try my hand at something entirely different. 

Andy: How different?  

Robin: I’ve always wanted to own an ice cream shop.  

Andy: An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want t o rethink that business plan.

Andy begins our dialogue by saying to Robin, “I can ’t believe you’re really selling up.” “To sell up” is a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to sell most of what you own with the plan of moving to another city or another place. Usually we use this phrasal verb in talking about a business that is se lling its assets – what it owns – in order to move to a new place or perhaps simply t o go out of business.  

Andy says, “I thought you’d stick it out for anothe r year.” The expression “to stick (stick) it out (out)” means to continue doing somet hing even though it is very difficult, even though there are a lot of challenge s and problems. “To stick it out” means to persist to continue working on something o r doing something, even when it is difficult.  

Robin says, “Business has been slow for three years  running.” When we say “business has been slow,” we mean that we haven’t b een making very much money. The business is not doing very well. Now, od dly enough, if the business is doing well, we don’t say, “Business has been run ning fast.” We only say, “Business has been running slow,” if the business h as been unsuccessful. If a business is successful, we’d probably say something  like, “It’s been going great.”  

Robin says that “business has been slow for three y ears running,” meaning three years in a row – consecutively, one after the other . She says, “I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon.” “To count on” some thing means to depend on something, to rely on something. “To pick up” here as a phrasal verb means to increase in speed or pace. In this case, it means t o be making more money. If business is picking up, you’re getting more busines s.  

Robin says, “I’m selling this business now before i t’s completely worthless.” If something is “worthless” (worthless), it means it h as no value. It is not worth any money. Andy says, “You should get a good price with  all that equipment and inventory.” Andy says Robin should get a good price , meaning that she’ll get a lot  

of money for her business. She has “equipment and i nventory” (inventory). “Inventory” refers to all of the things – the goods , the products – that a company has made or owns but hasn’t sold yet.  

So if you sell, I don’t know, T-shirts, and you hav e a hundred T-shirts in your house that you are selling – let’s say online – you r inventory of T-shirts is 100. You have 100 T-shirts in your inventory. Usually we  use the word “inventory” only for physical products, not for services or digital products like downloads, for example.  

Robin says, “I’m hoping that my valuation is in lin e with what buyers want to pay.” The “valuation” (valuation) of something is how muc h something is worth. If you are going to sell your business, usually you have t o have someone evaluate it, tell you how much it is worth. That would give you a “valuation.”  

The expression “in line (line) with” means similar to or in accordance with – not significantly different than. It’s used when we’re comparing two different concepts. In this case, we’re comparing the valuati on – what Robin thinks or what an expert thinks her business is worth – and w hat buyers want to pay for the business. We want the valuation to be “in line with,” or at about the same amount as, what buyers want to pay.  

She says, “I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my  consulting services as part of the deal.” “To sweeten (sweeten) the pot (pot)” mea ns to make something more attractive to buyers, especially by adding somethin g free. So, for example, when you go to buy a new car, the salesman or saleswoman  might say, “Well, if you buy the car today, I’ll give you the air-conditioni ng system for free,” or “I’ll give you a new CD player.” The salesperson is trying to sweeten the pot – trying to make the deal more enticing, more interesting to yo u so that you will go ahead and buy it.  

Robin wants to sweeten the pot in selling her busin ess by offering her consulting services. “Consulting” (consulting) here means givi ng advice, giving help to someone, especially another business. When you have  a “consultant” – a person who consults – that person gives you help or advice  with your business. Robin says, “I’ll introduce the new owners to my supplier s and clients, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operati ons.” A business’s “suppliers” (suppliers) are the companies and people that the b usiness buys things from.  

So, if you’re a restaurant, your suppliers would in clude people who sell you food that you then prepare to sell in your restaurant. “ To go over the books” (books) means to review the accounting records and financia l statements for a business.  

“The books” refers to the accounting system or acco unting information that used to be kept in a single book. Nowadays, of course, i t’s in a computer program for most businesses. Robin is going to introduce the ne w owners to her suppliers and clients – that is, customers – go over the book s with them, and help them set up or establish daily operations.  

Andy says, “That should give them a jump-start.” A “jump-start” is an early beginning, an opportunity to start something more q uickly than you might otherwise be able to do. Andy says, “With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope tha t business is better there.” But Robin says, “I couldn’t do that,” meaning she c ouldn’t start up a similar business in another part of the same city.  

She says, “The sales contract,” the agreement to se ll the business, “has a non- compete clause.” A “clause” (clause) in a contract is a section or part of a contract or agreement. “To compete” (compete) means  to go up against someone for the same clients or the same customers.  If you have a “non- compete clause,” that’s an agreement where you say you will not start a similar business or try to take business away from the pers on you are selling your business to.  

So, if I own a donut shop, and I sell the donut sho p to someone with a non- compete clause in the contract, I am agreeing not t o open up another donut shop a mile away that would then take business away from  the original donut shop. (That’s making me hungry, talking about donuts, fra nkly.) Robin says, “That’s only fair,” meaning that would be the fair and just  way to do it. Andy says, “I guess,” meaning okay, I agree. “What are you going to do now?”  

Robin says, “I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of  the sale, I might try my hand at something entirely different.” The “proceeds (pr oceeds) of a sale” are the profits, the money that you get from selling someth ing. If you sell your car for a thousand dollars, the proceeds of the sale are a th ousand dollars. “To try your hand (hand) at” something means to attempt to do so mething for the first time, not knowing whether you will be successful or not. If you have never played tennis and you say, “I’m going to try my hand at te nnis,” you mean you are going to play tennis for the first time.  

Robin wants to try her hand at something entirely o r completely different. Andy says, “How different?” Robin says, “I’ve always wan ted to own an ice cream shop” – that is, a store that sells ice cream. Andy  says, “An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want to rethink that business pla n.”  

So, we learn that Robin is going to be living in Al aska, which of course is a very cold state in the United States. And it’s not a pla ce where you would expect a lot of people to be wanting to buy ice cream, since ice  cream is usually more popular in hot places. That’s why Andy says he thin ks that Robin should “rethink,” or think about again, her business plan.  Your “business plan” is your written document including the plans that you have for starting a new business or opening a new business.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Robin: Business has been slow for three years runni ng and I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon. I’m selling this bu siness now before it’s completely worthless.
