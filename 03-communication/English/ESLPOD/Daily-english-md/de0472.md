This episode is called “Feeling Nervous About Public Spea king.”  It’s a dialogue between Simone and Gabriel; they’re going to be talki ng about some common vocabulary used to describe when you get nervous before havin g to speak in front of a large group.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  They’re about to introduce you.  You’re on ne xt.  Are you ready?

Gabriel:  No…yes… no!

Simone:  You don’t look so well.  Are you all right?

Gabriel:  I don’t know.  My palms are clammy, I’m breaki ng out into a cold sweat, and my legs feel like jelly.

Simone:  It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, that ’s all.  Just take a deep breath.  You’ll be fine.

Gabriel:  I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth i s dry.  Where can I get a glass of water?

Simone:  I don’t know and there isn’t time.

Gabriel:  Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to f reeze up or get tongue-tied.  I just know it.

 Simone:  Get a hold of yourself.  You’re well prepar ed and you’ll do a great job. Okay, they’ve just announced your name.  Get out there!

Gabriel:  I can’t!

Simone:  The entire audience is waiting for you.  Pull  yourself together and get out there!

Gabriel:  Here goes nothing!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Simone saying, “They’re about  to introduce you.  You’re on next.  Are you ready?”  Simone is talking to Gabriel;  Gabriel is about to give a talk – a speech to a group of people.  Simone says, “You’ re on next,” meaning you are the next person to do something; it is your turn,  we might also say.  “Are you ready?” and Gabriel says, “No…yes…no!”  Simone says, “You don’t look so well.  Are you all right?”  Gabriel says, “I don’t know.   My palms are clammy.” Your “palms” are the insides of your hands, but not in cluding your fingers.  The word “palm” actually has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gabriel’s palms are clammy (clammy).  “Clammy” means a li ttle bit wet, a little cold perhaps, not very pleasant to touch.  Well, if you’re  palms are clammy, typically that means you’re nervous.  Gabriel says, “I’m bre aking out into a cold sweat.”  “To break out into a cold sweat” means to sudden ly have your skin begin to feel wet, usually because you are very scared or nervous.  Gabriel also says that his legs feel like jelly.  “Jelly” is normally a sweet food made from fruit and sugar; it’s similar to another word, “jam” (jam).  But  here, it’s used to describe someone’s muscles feeling very weak.  Somebody says, “My legs fee l like jelly,” they mean my legs feel weak.  Again, probably because you a re nervous, at least that’s the case for Gabriel.

Simone says, “It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, th at’s all.”  “To have a bad case of (something)” means to have a serious or very sever e instance or situation.  You could have a bad case of coughing, if you were coughing a lot and it was causing you pain.  Well, Gabriel has a bad case of stage fright.  “Stage” describes the place where you stand to give a speech, or per haps where the actors stand when they are performing a play.  Usually it’ s a little bit higher than the floor where you are sitting.  “Fright” means to be afraid, so “stage fright” is fear of speaking or performing in front of a large g roup.  When I was in high school, I was a member of the speech team.  This was a gro up of students that

 competed with other students by giving speeches on differe nt topics.  I would always have some stage fright before it was my turn to spea k.

Simone says to Gabriel, “Just take a deep breath.  You’l l be fine.”  “To take a deep breath” means to breathe in a lot of air very slo wly; [Jeff inhales] that’s to take a deep breath.  You let it out [Jeff exhales] and  it helps relax you.  Gabriel says, “I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth is dry. ”  The expression “to have butterflies in your stomach” means that you feel very nervous and possibly sick.  Your stomach, perhaps, is reacting to all the nervou sness, the stress.  So having butterflies in your stomach is another way of saying  how nervous you are, so nervous that you might feel ill – you might feel sick.

Gabriel says, “Where can I get a glass of water?”  Simon e says, “I don’t know and there isn’t time” – you don’t have time to go get  a glass of water.  Gabriel says, “Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to freeze u p or get tongue-tied.  I just know it.”  When you “freeze up,” you are unable to move or do anything, usually because you are very scared or surprised at something.  “To  get tongue-tied” means to be unable to speak clearly or to say or make a com plete sentence.  So if you are freezing up and are tongue-tied, you’re not  going to be able to talk. The verb “freeze” has several different meanings in Engl ish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Simone says, “Get a hold of yourself.”  The expression “to  get a hold of one’s self” means to calm down and control your words and action s.  Someone who becomes very excited, very angry perhaps may be unable to contr ol themselves. In Gabriel’s case, he’s very nervous, so Simone is saying get a hold of yourself, calm down, control your thoughts and actions.  “You’re we ll prepared and you’ll do a great job.”  “To be well prepared” means to be ready; you’ve done your work, you practiced – you are well prepared.

Simone then says, “Okay, they’ve just announced your name.   Get out there!” Gabriel says, “I can’t!”  Simone responds, “The entire au dience is waiting for you.”  The “audience” are the people who are waiting for Gabriel to speak. Simone says, “Pull yourself together and get out there!”   “To pull yourself together” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to calm do wn, to be able to do something.  It is similar to “get a hold of yourself,”  you have to calm down and perform – do whatever action you’re expected to do.  In this case for Gabriel, it’s to give a speech.

Gabriel ends by saying, “Here goes nothing!”  “Here goes nothing” is a phrase used to show that you are going to try to do something,  but you don’t think you are going to be successful.  When I was in college, every t ime I would ask a girl

 out on a date I would say to myself, “Here goes nothing! ”  I tried, but it usually wasn’t successful!  Gabriel, however, is going to try to give  his speech and get a hold of himself – pull himself together so that he can  give the speech effectively.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
