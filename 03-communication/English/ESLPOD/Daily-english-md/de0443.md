This episode is called “Having a Slumber Party.”  It’s a co nversation between Russ and Irene about a party that the girl, Irene, is g oing to have with her friends. It’s a particular kind of party that is very popular especia lly among young girls in the United States.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russ:  Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.

Irene:  I’m just having a few friends over for a sleepove r and it’s none of your business.

Russ:  Don’t be like that.  How many people did you invit e?

Irene:  I’m not telling you anything.  I know what you’ re thinking.  You want to pull pranks on us.

Russ:  No, I don’t.  I just want to know how many giggl ing girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.

Irene:  You’re not going to get anything out of me.  I can see right through you.

Russ:  Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?

Irene:  Don’t be stupid!  I haven’t worn those since I was six!

Russ:  Can I be part of the pillow fight?

Irene:  No way!  You’re not invited!

 Russ:  But you’re going to stay up all night and watch mo vies, aren’t you?  I want to do that, too.

Irene:  You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.

Russ:  I’m not doing anything.  I’m only trying to help you plan your party.

Irene:  Right!  You want to help me?  It’s more like you want to wreck my party.

Russ:  Ah, you’ve hurt my feelings.

Irene:  I doubt it.  Now leave me alone!

The title of this episode is “Having a Slumber (slumber ) Party.”  A “slumber party” is also sometimes called a “sleepover” (one word).  A slumb er party or sleepover is when many children sleep at one of their friend’s ho uses.  Usually, they do this on the weekend, on a Friday or Saturday night, and the kids all come over, maybe three, four, five, or more kids come over and the y bring something to sleep in, a sleeping bag, and they have lots of food and  stay up late at night, and so forth.  The term “slumber party” is usually one more associated with girls than with boys, although it’s possible for both boys and girls to have this kind of party – this sort of sleepover.  When I was in, oh, fourth or  fifth grade, I remember going over and sleeping at my friend’s house with a coupl e of other friends, and we would stay up late at night and watch movies.  In fact , I think even once we stayed up all night, talking and watching movies and eati ng.  It’s a very popular event for children growing up in the U.S.

Irene is going to have a slumber party and Russ, her brot her, says, “Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.”  Irene says, “I’m just having a few friends over (meaning I’m having some friends come to our  house) for a sleepover and it’s none of your business.”  The expression “ none of your business” means it’s not something that you need to know ab out, it’s not important for you.  But, we use this expression in a some what hostile or negative sense.  If someone says, “it’s none of your business,” that’s n ot a nice thing to say.  They’re saying that you have no reason or right to kno w this, and it is often said after someone has, perhaps, tried to get informat ion out of you that you don’t want to give them that you think is private.

Russ says, “Don’t be like that,” to his sister.  “Don’t be l ike that” is a phrase we use to ask someone to change his or her attitude – his or her behavior, usually

 when they are angry.  Russ says, “Don’t be like that.  Ho w many people did you invite?”  Irene says, “I’m not telling you anything.”  Of  course, they’re brother and sister so sometimes they don’t get along, they don’t play nice with each other, they’re not friendly to each other.

Irene says, “I know what you’re thinking.  You want to pu ll pranks on us.”  To “pull pranks” (pranks) means to do something to another person, usually something that would be funny or something that would be embar rassing.  It’s playing a joke on someone, often a physical sort of thing.  So for examp le, when I was growing up it was sometimes common for my friends and I to run ar ound in our neighborhood and go up to a house and knock on the d oor or ring the doorbell and then run away and wait for the person to come out,  and of course, no one would be there.  Now, that’s not very funny to me now, but I guess when I was younger it was funny.  That would be a prank that you w ould pull on someone. So we use the verb “to pull” with this particular expressi on.  “Pull” has many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Russ says, “No, I don’t,” meaning I will not pull pranks o n you and your friends. He says, “I just want to know how many giggling girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.”  To “giggle” (giggle)  means to laugh, usually to laugh in very high voice [Jeff giggles].  I can’t do it ve ry well because I’m not a girl.  But girls, especially young girls are often seen or  heard giggling.  Usually it’s because you are embarrassed or because there’s something fun ny that’s happened.  It’s something we associate mostly with young gi rls.  Giggling girls, in this case, will be in sleeping bags.  I mentioned sleepin g bags a few minutes ago; a “sleeping bag” is a long, warm, thick piece of materia l (a fabric) that is filled often with feathers, and it allows you to sleep on the  ground and still stay warm. So, it’s like a big blanket that has a zipper on the sid e so that you can stay warm. It’s often used for camping outdoors, but it could also be used at someone’s house.  When you are sleeping on the floor, you could sl eep in a sleeping bag. So all the kids, when they came over for the slumber part y, would bring their own sleeping bag.  So, Russ says, “I just want to know how man y giggling girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitch en.”  The idea here is that the girls will be sleeping probably out in the main, o r in what we would call the “living room,” and since the kitchen is often next to that , if he wants to go to the kitchen he’ll have to step over these girls in the sleeping  bags to get there.

Irene says, “You’re not going to get anything out of me .”  To “get something out of someone” means to get information, especially secret i nformation from someone, to do something to make the other person tell  you something that they don’t want to tell you, or that you want to know that is a secret.  Irene says, “I can

 see right through you.”  The expression “to see right thr ough someone” means that you understand someone’s plans; you understand what a  person is trying to do, even though the person is trying to hide it from you  – is trying to keep it a secret.

Russ says, in response, “Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?” “Pajamas” (pajamas) are clothes that you wear to bed, u sually there’s a shirt and there are pants.  For very young children, sometimes there  are pajamas that are one piece – that the whole thing is one piece of clothi ng, and that on the bottom there are little feet, like shoes, so that the young chil d doesn’t get cold.  Of course, Irene is older than that, and so she would not st ill be using something like that, so Russ is making a joke: are you going to wear your pajamas with feet, just like you did when you were a younger girl.  Irene says, “D on’t be stupid!  I haven’t worn those since I was six!”

Then Russ asks, “Can I be part of the pillow fight?”  A “pillow” is something that you put your head on when you sleep.  So, a “pillow fig ht” is when people hit each other with pillows.  It’s something that might hap pen at a slumber party or a sleepover.  Irene says, “No way!” meaning absolutely not, c ompletely impossible. “You’re not invited!” – you’re not invited to the part y.  Russ says, “But you’re going to stay up all night and watch movies, aren’t you?  I want to do that, too.” To “stay up all night” means to stay awake all night, n ever to go to sleep.  Once again, Russ is joking – is kidding with Irene, he doesn’t really want to do that.

Irene says, “You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.”  To “tease” someone means to make jokes about someone, to laugh at so meone, or make other people laugh at someone.  It’s not considered a nice thing to do.  Russ says, “I’m not doing anything.  I’m only trying to help yo u plan your party.”  Of course, he isn’t!

Irene says, “Right!”  When we use the word “right” in that way, with that intonation – that sound, “oh, right!” – what you’re  really saying is that you don’t believe what the other person is saying.  Normally, “righ t” means that you agree with someone, or that someone is telling you something that is true.  But here, when used with that particular tone it is the opposite;  it means I don’t believe you. Irene then says, “You want to help me?  It’s more like yo u want to wreck my party.”  To “wreck” (wreck) here means to ruin or to dest roy.  “Wreck” has a couple of different meanings; once again, take a look at  the Learning Guide for this episode.

 Russ then says, once again joking, “Ah, you’ve hurt my feeli ngs.”  To “hurt someone’s feelings” means to make someone feel bad, to make someone feel sad about something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Russ:  Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.

Irene:  I’m just having a few friends over for a sleepove r and it’s none of your business.
