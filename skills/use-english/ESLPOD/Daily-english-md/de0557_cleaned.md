This episode is called “Applying for a Passport.”  It’s a d ialogue between Orlando and someone at the passport office.  It’s going to be usi ng a lot of vocabulary related to getting a passport, at least here in the U nited States.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Clerk:  Yes, can I help you? 

Orlando:  I want to get a passport. 

Clerk:  Have you filled out the application?   

Orlando:  No, I haven’t. 

Clerk:  Come back when you’ve filled it out.   

Orlando:  Okay, I’ve completed the application. 

Clerk:  Let me see it.  You need to fill in your Socia l Security number here and you need to provide evidence of your citizenship.  Have you ever had a passport before? 

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.   

Clerk:  In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your  birth certificate, or if you were born outside of the country, a copy of your Natural ization Certificate or a Consular Report of Birth Abroad. 

Orlando:  I don’t have those documents with me.  

 Clerk:  Come back when you do. 

Orlando:  Okay, I’m back.  I have a copy of my birth certif icate. 

Clerk:  All right.  Let me see some identification. 

Orlando:  Identification? 

Clerk:  Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a gover nment ID, or a military ID. 

Orlando:  I’ll be right back. 

Clerk:  Yes? 

Orlando:  Here’s my military ID. 

Clerk:  Where are you passport photos? 

Orlando:  Passport photos? 

Clerk:  Yes, you need two identical passport photos. 

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

Our dialogue begins with the clerk, the person who is wo rking at the passport office, saying to Orlando, “Yes, can I help you?”  “Can I  help you?” or “May I help you?” mean the same thing.  I should also point out tha t although you can get a passport by going to the U.S. government passport office,  most people get their passports at the Post Office; that’s where you submit your a pplication. 

Orlando says, “I want to get a passport,” which you pro bably know is a small, official book that is given to you by your government that allows you to travel to other countries.  The clerk says, “Have you filled out (have you completed) the application (the form that requests all the informatio n about you)?”  Orlando says, “No, I haven’t.”  The clerk says, “Come back when you’ve fill ed it out (when you’ve completed it).” 

 So Orlando goes away, he comes back, and he says, “Okay, I’ve co mpleted the application.”  The clerk says, “Let me see it,” please allo w me to look at it – the clerk isn’t actually that polite.  She says, “You need to f ill in (to write in) your Social Security number here.”  The “Social Security numbe r” is a number that pretty much everyone in the United States has, issued by the  government – the government gives you this number.  Usually you get the nu mber when you are a young child, or even a baby.  It identifies you.  It is a number that is typically only given to people who have legal permission to be here in  the United States. Social Security is also the name of a program that provid es money for those who need money to live on, especially those who are old.  It’ s sort of like our national retirement system – except they don’t have very much money!  T he Social Security number, then, is one thing that you have to put  on almost every official application that you fill out in the U.S. 

The clerk tells Orlando he also needs evidence of his citi zenship.  “Evidence,” here, means the same as proof; evidence would be a writt en document that supports what you are saying.  In this case, Orlando is saying  “I am a U.S. citizen,” and the clerk is telling him he has to prove tha t – he has to show that. “Citizenship” means, of course, belonging to a particular  country.  Some people have dual citizenship; they are citizens of more than one co untry – two countries if it’s dual citizenship.  I suppose you could have citizenshi p in more than two countries, it would be a little unusual 

Orlando is asked if he has ever had a passport before.  Passports in the United States are typically issued, or given to you, and they are good for 10 years; every 10 years you have to get a new passport.  Orlando says, “No , I haven’t (I haven’t had a passport before).”  The clerk says, “In that case (in  this situation), you’ll need to submit a copy of your birth certificate.”  “To  submit” (submit) means to officially give or send something to someone or to some o rganization, especially if that organization has to review or approve whatever i t is that you are sending in.  So for example, you could submit a job applicati on.  You could give the company an application, they would look at it and see if  they want to hire you – to have you work for them.  The word “submit” has a couple o f different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some mo re explanations. 

Well, the clerk is asking Orlando for his “birth certificat e.”  This is an official piece of paper that shows your complete name, when and where  you were born, who your parents are, and typically the name of the hospital,  although that isn’t always on the birth certificate.  Every state has its own bi rth certificate system; there is not a national birth certificate system in the U .S.  If I wanted to get my birth certificate I would have to go back, or write – no wadays email – the Minnesota government office that takes care of birth cert ificates.  Within a given  

 state, mostly the birth certificates are arranged by county.   A “county” is a smaller division within state.  Minnesota, for example, has 87 co unties – 87 different regions.  In fact, it has more counties than any other st ate in the United States for some reason.  I would have to go back to the county I was born in, Ramsey County, which is where St. Paul is, and ask for a copy of m y birth certificate.   

I actually did that when I was…I don’t know…12 years old m aybe, and we discovered – I discovered that my parents had not officially put a name in for me on the birth certificate.  They hadn’t decided what the y were going to call me. Remember, I’m the youngest of 11 children, so they had sort of gone through all of the names that they wanted.  Well, because they didn ’t know my name by the time my mother left the hospital, the birth certificate  simply said “Baby Boy McQuillan.”  I had to then officially prove to the count y that my legal name was Jeffrey – that’s my full name, and I had to provide them  evidence that I have used this name all of my life.  But for the first 12 yea rs of my existence on this earth I was officially known as Baby Boy McQuillan, which i s actually a good name since I was the youngest in the family, and we oft en call the youngest in the family the baby of the family – even if they’re 46  years old!  I’m still the baby of the family. 

Back to Orlando: Orlando has to get a birth certificate , or if he was born outside of the United States he needs a copy of either his Natur alization Certificate or something called a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  A “Naturalization Certificate” is an official piece of paper showing that you were once a citizen of another country, but then you became a U.S. citizen.  So if you move here after 20 years of living in, say, Japan or France or South Afr ica – wherever, and you want to become a U.S. citizen you have to get what is cal led “naturalized.”  You become a citizen, and that process is called “naturalizatio n.”  So, a “Naturalization Certificate” is a certificate proving tha t you officially became a U.S. citizen on this particular day; it’s not your birth ce rtificate.  If you have an American mother or father, or both, and you are born in another country you’re still an American citizen.  However, because you will not  have a birth certificate from a U.S. hospital you need to go to the local emba ssy or consulate and get a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  An “embassy” is the m ain headquarters of representatives from your government in another country.  Usually the embassies are in the capital cities of the other countries;  here in the United States, they would be in Washington, D.C.  Many governme nts also have small offices called “consulates” that are in other cities in t he United States or in a different country.  So for example, here in Los Angel es there is a consulate for the government of Mexico, a consulate for China, a consul ate for Spain.  Dozens of other countries have consulates in big U.S. cities, especi ally cities that may have a lot of citizens from their country.  The U.S. has co nsulates in other cities,  

 in addition to embassies, in other countries.  A “consular ,” then, refers to the notion of a representative; “consul,” here, is more gen erally a representative of your government.  Consular Report of Birth Aboad; “ab road” simply means in another country.  So it’s sort of like a birth certificat e but it comes from the U.S. State Department, from either an embassy or a consulate,  that shows that you are, in fact, an American citizen. 

Well, Orlando says he doesn’t have any of these things.  He says, “I don’t have those documents (those official pieces of paper) with me. ”  A “document” can mean a couple of different things.  Once again, take a  look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  So the clerk says to Orlando , “Come back when you do,” meaning come back here when you have one of thes e official documents.  So he goes, and comes back again and gives his birth certificate to the clerk.  The clerk then says, “Let me see some identificat ion (let me see something that proves that you are who you are).”  Usuall y that means either a valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military ID .  A “driver’s license” is issued, or given, by each state, that says you have permission t o drive in that state, and in any other state, but you need at least on e driver’s license from one state.  A “valid” driver’s license just means a driver’s lice nse that is current, that was issued recently.  A “government ID” is identification that is given by the government, perhaps another government agency besides the state where you live.  A “military ID (or identification)” is a card tha t says you are a member of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or the Marines, and that you work in that organization. 

So Orlando has to leave again, he comes back, he says, “He re’s my military ID.” The clerk then asks, “Where are you passport photos?”  In o rder to get a passport you have to have two pictures taken of yourself, and you need to bring them and give them with your application to the governm ent representative in order to get a passport.  Passport photos are very small, a nd are just of your head.  Well of course, Orlando doesn’t have the passpor t photos.  The clerk says, “Yes, you’ll need two identical (or the same) photog raphs.”  Orlando says, “I’ll be right back,” and leaves again. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
