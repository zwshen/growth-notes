This episode is called “Delegating Work.”  It’s a dialogu e between Anya and Estevan talking about how you give other people work whe n you are a boss or a manager.  It uses a lot of vocabulary that you might use in talking about how you are giving other people work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anya:  I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this w ork done before I go on vacation.

Estevan:  What you need to do is to delegate.  Stop bei ng a control freak and get other people to help you with your work.

Anya:  I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended up having to redo the work myself.  It was no timesaver at all.  It definitely wasn ’t worth the trouble.

Estevan:  That’s because you have to delegate in the righ t way.  You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees.  You have to gi ve them explicit instructions and measurable goals.

Anya:  I did that.  I gave my employee detailed instructi ons and she still let me down.

Estevan:  I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you p eriodically, did you?  To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports.  That way, you can make sure she’s on the right track.  See what I  mean?

Anya:  Okay, maybe you’re right.  I know one thing.  If I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!

Our dialogue begins with Anya saying, “I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this work done before I go on vacation.”  Estevan says, “What you need to do is to delegate.”  To “delegate” means to give other peop le part of the work that you are supposed to do; asking other people, in other words,  to help you with your work – to give them things to do.

Estevan says, “Stop being a control freak and get other p eople to help you with your work.”  The expression “control freak” (freak) describe s a person who likes to be in control of everything, someone who doesn’t like other people helping them.  A control freak is usually considered a negative desc ription of someone, although some people say, “Well, I’m a control freak.  I  want everything to be done just the way I like it,” which means you have to do it all yourself, usually.

Anya says, “I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended u p having to redo the work myself.”  To “end up” is a phrasal verb that means to be  in a certain situation after or because of other things that have happened, us ually things that you didn’t expect to happen.  So for example: “After studyin g to be a doctor for seven years, he ended up running a website instead.”  You wo uld expect after studying to be a doctor that he would eventually then become a d octor, but instead something unexpected happened: he ended up working as a  website operator.  I actually read a story in the newspaper the other day abou t a doctor who did just that.

Anya said she had to “redo,” meaning to do something a gain, usually it’s something that wasn’t done right in the first place.  S he had to redo the work herself.  She said, “It was no timesaver at all.”  A “t imesaver” (one word) is something that allows you to do something in less time t han usual.  For example, a washing machine is a timesaver; you don’t have to wash the clothes by hand. A microwave oven can be a timesaver; it takes less time to c ook something in the microwave than it does in a regular oven.  Of course, it usually doesn’t taste as good either, but that’s one of the “compromises,” that ’s one of the things we give up for something that saves us time.  Anya says, “It defini tely wasn’t worth the trouble.”  To be “worth the trouble” means to have b enefits or advantages that are greater than the work you needed to do something .  So for example, if it takes you five hours to make an apple pie, you may say, “Wel l, it wasn’t worth the trouble” – it wasn’t that good, it wasn’t worth m y time.  We might just say, simply, it wasn’t “worthwhile.”

Estevan says, “That’s because you have to delegate in the rig ht way,” in the correct manner.  “You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees,” he

 says.  To “assign,” here, means to tell someone to do some thing; it’s what a boss will do with his or her workers.  It’s what a teacher do es to his or her students: she assigns homework to her students.  I used to assign to m y students at the university when I taught there.  Of course, they never act ually did the homework, but I did assign them to do it!  “Assign” has a couple of  different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Estevan says, “You have to give (your employees) explicit instr uctions and measurable goals.”  Something that is “explicit” (explici t) is something that is clear, obvious, and easy to understand; something that is very specific without anything being hidden or assumed.  To give someone “mea surable goals” means to give them an “objective,” something you want them to achieve or accomplish that can be measured – you know how they are doing on it.  Anything that is “measurable” is something that you know how big or small , or how much of that thing there is.  A “goal” is an objective, an “aim,” we  might say.

Estevan tells Anya that she has to give her employees explici t instructions and measurable goals.  Anya says, however, “I did that.  I gave  my employee detailed instructions and she let me down.”  To “let someone down ” is a phrasal verb meaning to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s exp ectations.  “My students let me down when they handed in their homewor k” – it was not as good as I was hoping it would be.

Estevan says, “I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you periodically, did you?”  To “report back” to someone means to give someone  information about how you are doing – how you are progressing, how much wo rk you are getting done.  To report back means to give someone an “update,”  recent, current information about how they are doing.  Estevan says that Anya probably didn’t ask her employee to report back to her periodically.  “Per iodically” means at a certain time, evenly spaced, for example every week or every month or every two months; something happens on a regular schedule, you coul d say.  He says, “To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports.  To “get results” means to be able to do what you want to do, to  “meet your goals,” we would say.  A “progress report” is written or spoken infor mation about how you are doing, how well you are doing.  It’s similar to an  update – a “progress report,” how much have you done.  “That way,” Estevan says, if you ge t progress reports, “you can make sure she’s on the right track.”  To “be on the right track” (track) means to do something the correct way – the right way – to make progress on something and to be doing it correctly.  You’re not fin ished yet, but you are “making good progress,” we would say.  You are getting t hings done when you should be getting them done, and moving closer to your goal – your objective.

 Anya says, “Okay, maybe you’re right.  I know one thing.  I f I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!”  Remember,  she’s going on vacation and she needs someone to help her with her work.   I feel this way all the time – except, I never get a vacation!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
