This episode is a dialogue about learning a skilled  trade – that is, learning to do something with your hands and mind in order to make  money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeannine: What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?

Orlando: I’m going to trade school. My father was a  stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something different.

Jeannine: Like what?

Orlando: Maybe I’ll study to become an electrician or plumber. Those are skills that are always in demand.

Jeannine: Don’t they have long apprenticeships?

Orlando: Yes, but it’s better than training to be a  machinist or technician. It’s easier to open your own shop as an electrician or p lumber.

Jeannine: With your skills, you can always get a jo b as a carpenter.

Orlando: I think carpentry is a dying art. Most peo ple don’t get furniture or other things custom-made anymore.

Jeannine: You know, you could always take a complet ely different path, learning a completely different skilled trade.

Orlando: Like what?

 Jeannine: You could become a medical or dental tech nician or even get a cosmetology degree.

Orlando: Are you serious?! Would you want these han ds cutting your hair?

Our dialogue begins with Jeannine saying to Orlando , “What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?” “To gr aduate” means to complete some level of schooling – in this case, high school . Orlando says, “I’m going to a trade school.” A “trade” (trade) is one of the many  different jobs involving the use of your hands to either make something or to fix so mething. We’ll talk about several different examples of “trades” in a minute.

A “trade school” is a school that teaches you the t echnical skills and gives you the knowledge you need to perform certain kinds of jobs, often jobs that don’t require a four-year university or college degree. “ Trade schools” are sometimes called “vocational schools” – schools that teach yo u things that will allow you to get a job right away, but that don’t require a four -year education. Orlando says he’s going to a trade school.

“My father,” he says, “was a stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something di fferent.” One of the many trades you can study for and work in is a “mason” ( mason). A mason is a person who works with stone or brick and builds things out  of those materials. If you’re building a building that is made of stone or brick,  you may need a mason. Many buildings nowadays – most buildings nowadays – are not built out of stone or brick, but some still are, and if you are going to make a building or, say, a wall with bricks, you would want a mason to do that for you. That’s a particular trade.

Another example of a trade is a “mechanic” (mechani c). A “mechanic” is a person who repairs or fixes machines that are broken, espe cially cars and trucks and other vehicles. If you’re having problems with your  car, you will most likely take it to a mechanic – a “car mechanic” – who can fix the engine or whatever is wrong with your car.

It used to be as recently as twenty, thirty years a go that many people would fix their own cars. People would try to fix their own e ngines. But nowadays, that isn’t quite as popular, perhaps because car engines have become more complicated due to the computers in the cars. I remember, certa inly back in the 1980s, people trying to fix their own cars – my friends, for exam ple. I never tried to do that

because I don’t really know much about car engines.  But if you do know a lot about car engines, you could become a “mechanic.”

Orlando wants to try something different. Jeannine says, “Like what?” Orlando says, “Maybe I’ll study to be an electrician or a p lumber.” An “electrician” (electrician) is a person who works installing and maintaining electrical equipment. If you need to have electricity in a bui lding you would call an electrician, and that person would put the wires an d the necessary wires and equipment needed to have electricity.

A “plumber” (plumber) – notice that we don’t pronou nce the “b” in “plumber” – is the person who installs – that is, who puts in – an d maintains and repairs pipes and systems that move water in and out of a buildin g. A plumber would be needed if you wanted a bathroom or a kitchen. If yo u want to have a toilet or a shower in your bathroom, you would need to call a p lumber who would be able to put one in or fix it if there was a problem with it . All of my uncles were plumbers. My grandfather was a plumber. My great-grandfather was a plumber. I come from a whole family of plumbers.

In fact, if you go to my home city of St. Paul, Min nesota, and you drive down the street, you might see a car that says “McQuillan Pl umbing” on it. Those are my cousins. There’s been a “McQuillan Plumbing” busine ss in St. Paul, Minnesota since the nineteenth century. My father was the onl y member of his family, the only male member of his family, who did not become a plumber. He became a teacher, which is probably why I’m a teacher and no t a plumber. I think I would have made more money as a plumber, however.

In any case, Orlando is thinking of becoming an ele ctrician or a plumber. He says, “Those are skills that are always in demand.”  Something that is “in demand” (demand) is something that people want – in  this case, something people are willing to pay for. Since we’ll probably  always need bathrooms, we’ll probably always need plumbers. That’s why that is a  skill that is always “in demand.”

Jeannine says, “Don’t they have long apprenticeship s?” An “apprenticeship” (apprenticeship) is a period of time when someone in a trade – such as electricians and plumbers – works for another perso n in order to learn how to do his specific job. If you want to become a plumber o r an electrician, you will study for a certain amount of time, but then you will wor k for a few years for someone else who will teach you what you really need to kno w.

The trades, such as electrician and plumber, requir e more than just time in a classroom learning from a teacher. You have to go o ut there and actually do it in order to learn it, and that’s why we have “apprenti ceships.” These are periods of time when the people who want to become electrician s and plumbers work for other electricians and plumbers who teach them all the things, or many of the things, they need to know.

Orlando says, “Yes” – meaning yes, these trades do have long apprenticeships – “but it’s better than training to be a machinist or  technician.” “To train” (train) is to get the skills in order to do something. The verb “ train” is a very general one used in many different situations. Usually it’s used whe n you are talking about a specific kind of task or job.

So, you can train to be a teacher. That’s a specifi c job, a specific skill or set of skills you need to learn. You can train to be a plu mber. You can train to be a secretary. You could train to be a computer program mer. All of these would be possible uses of the verb “to train.” “To train,” then, is to study and/or practice in order to learn how to do a specific thing. We also use the verb “to train” when you’re preparing for an athletic event. If you are going to run a marathon, you might “train” for the marathon – spend time prepari ng for it.

Orlando refers to “training to be a machinist or te chnician.” A “machinist” (machinist) is a person who operates a machine in a  factory. The term “technician” (technician) refers to anyone who has technical skills for doing this particular kind of job, usually a job that doesn’t require a lot of extra training. For example, there are “lab” or laboratory technicians.  Hospitals, for example, have “laboratory technicians” who work to determine what ’s in your blood. Those people aren’t doctors. They are, however, working w ith special machinery that requires technical skills.

Orlando says, “It’s easier to open your own shop as  an electrician or plumber.” The word “shop” here means business. Jeannine says,  “With your skills, you can always get a job as a carpenter.” A “carpenter” (ca rpenter) is a person who makes things out of wood. Orlando says, however, “I  think carpentry is a dying art.”

A “dying (dying) art (art)” is something that is be coming less and less common, that fewer people are interested in nowadays than, say, in the past. “Most people don’t get furniture or other things custom-made any more.” If something is “custom (custom) – made (made),” it is produced or made just for you. There’s only one of those. In British English there’s a won derful word, “bespoke” (bespoke), that describes basically the same idea.

 Jeannine says, “You know, you could always take a c ompletely different path, learning a completely different skilled trade.” A “ path” (path) is a way that you get from one place to another. In this case, Jeannine is talking about how Orlando could do something completely different – not be a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician. He could learn a different “skilled tr ade” – that is, a different job similar to the jobs we’ve been talking about.

Orlando says, “Like what?” Jeannine says, “You coul d become a medical or dental technician or even get a cosmetology degree. ” A “dental (dental) technician” is a person who makes teeth – artificia l teeth, of course – and other things that are used by a dentist. Jeannine suggest s that Orlando could also get a “cosmetology (cosmetology) degree.” “Cosmetology”  refers to the business of making people’s hair, skin, and/or nails more attra ctive.

Orlando says, “Are you serious?! Would you want the se hands cutting your hair?” I’m not sure why, but Orlando apparently feels he w ouldn’t do a very good job cutting anyone’s hair.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
