In this episode, we’re going to listen to a little story about controlling information – being careful what kind of information you give – t o television stations, newspapers, radio shows, and nowadays, news website s. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Pablo: Okay everybody, have a seat. The purpose of this meeting is to get everybody on the same page.  

I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prepared. This  fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in t he dark about our current situation.  

We’ve also prepared these talking points. This is f or internal use only. I don’t want them leaked to the media. These talking points  have been prepared to help everyone stay on message. Anyone talking to the med ia off-script will have to answer to me.  

These talking points preempt many of the possible q uestions you’ll be asked. We hope to take the wind out of their sails by address ing some of the media’s most likely questions up front. Any questions? 

Suzanna: Um, I’ve read through these talking points  and I’m still not sure how to answer one key question.  

Pablo: What’s that? 

Suzanna: Have we solved the huge issue that’s the c ause of our current problems?  

Pablo: It goes without saying that if the media eve r wants a straightforward answer, our response is always “no comment.”

We are at a meeting in this episode. The meeting is  being run by, or managed by, Pablo. Pablo begins by saying, “Okay everybody,  have a seat,” meaning please sit down. “The purpose of this meeting,” Pab lo continues, “is to get everybody on the same page” (page).  

The expression “to be on the same page” means to ha ve the same understanding or knowledge about something. Sometim es it can also mean to have the same opinion about something. So, if you s ay to someone, “I want to make sure we are on the same page,” you are saying to this person “I want to make sure we both understand the same thing,” or we  both agree about this issue or have the same knowledge about this issue.  

He says, “I’m passing out the fact sheet we’ve prep ared.” “To pass out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to give something to many  different people, usually a piece of paper. “To pass out” means to distribute –  we might also say “to hand (hand) out.” A teacher “hands out” papers to her st udents, or a boss “passes out” agendas to the members of the committee. “To pass o ut,” “to hand out,” “to distribute” all mean to give something to many diff erent people. You could also pass out water to people at a party. Everyone gets a glass of water or a bottle of water.  

Pablo is passing out a “fact (fact) sheet (sheet).”  A “fact sheet” is a piece of paper that contains important details or information abou t something. Often, fact sheets have simple sentences that just give the most impor tant or “key (key) information.” A fact sheet is usually just one piec e of paper that contains a summary of the most important information on a topi c. Pablo says, “This fact sheet gives a rundown on what has happened to date so that no one is in the dark about our current situation.”  

A “rundown” (rundown) – one word – is a summary of the most important points or pieces of information. We might also refer to it  as a “brief” or short “overview” (overview). If, for example, you miss a meeting, yo u might ask one of your “colleagues,” one of the people you work with, for a “rundown” on the meeting – a summary of the most important things that happened.  This is a “rundown” on  

what has happened “to date,” meaning up to the pres ent point or up to this moment. We might also say “so far.”  

It’s a “rundown on what has happened to date so tha t” – in order that – “no one is in the dark.” “To be in the dark” means to be unawa re or uninformed, without knowledge or information about something. We often use this with the verb “leave.” “I don’t want to leave you in the dark” or  “I don’t want you to be in the dark.” I want to give you the information.  

This expression “in the dark” would probably be use d more often in a business situation, although it could also be used in your p ersonal life. “I’m in the dark about what my neighbor is doing with his dog.” I do n’t know why it barks or makes noise all the time. I’m in the dark. Maybe he ’s teaching the dog to sing. I don’t know. Pablo continues, “We’ve also prepared t hese talking points.” “Talking points” are key ideas that you want someone to expr ess in an interview, a speech, or a presentation. They’re the points or id eas you are going to talk about.  

Nowadays, in business and in politics, “talking poi nts” are the key ideas that everyone from an organization or everyone who is su pporting a particular political candidate talks about so that the message is the sa me coming from the organization. If you have an organization, a busine ss that has had problems, you want everyone to talk about the problems in the sam e way so that the media – newspapers, magazines, television stations, and so forth – give the same message to their listeners or readers.  

You want everyone to be on the same page by using t he same talking points, the same basic pieces of information, so that everyone is given the same message. If you don’t do that, that could cause problems. So me people may say one thing. Other people may say something that contradicts tha t or that is different from that. So that’s why having talking points is such a n important part of modern business and modern politics. However, Pablo says t hat these talking points “are for internal use only.” “Internal (internal) use” m eans just within the company or within your organization.  

The opposite of internal would be “external” (exter nal). A business or political organization might create a set of talking points t hat it gives to all of the members of the “staff” – the people who work there. But the  business or organization doesn’t want the media to get these talking points directly because then it will look like the organization is just trying to presen t certain information and avoid other information being released. Of course, that’s  exactly what the organization is doing, but you don’t want people to think that.  

That’s why Pablo says, “I don’t want them,” meaning  these talking points, “leaked (leaked) to the media.” “To leak” something is to s hare secret information to someone who should not have it, especially to someo ne in the media – a newspaper, a magazine, a television channel, and so  forth. Pablo says, “These talking points have been prepared to help everyone stay on message.” “To stay” – or “be” – “on message” means to be focused on the  main ideas or main topic, to be consistent in what you are telling people so that you don’t have different messages.  

Pablo then warns the people at the meeting, “Anyone  talking to the media off- script will have to answer to me.” “Off-script” mea ns not following the talking points, not giving the message the company wants to  give. If you say someone “will have to answer to” you, you mean that person will have to explain his behavior to you and possibly be punished for not do ing the right thing.  

Pablo continues, “These talking points preempt many  of the possible questions you’ll be asked.” “To preempt” (preempt) means to d o something in order to prevent something else from happening or to ensure that something else doesn’t happen. “To preempt a disagreement” is to do someth ing to prevent a disagreement from happening. The talking points Pab lo has prepared will “preempt” possible questions. It will prevent the m edia from asking certain things. It will give the answers first, if you will.  

He says, “We hope to take the wind out of their sai ls by addressing some of the media’s most likely questions up front.” “To take t he wind (wind) out of someone’s sails (sails)” is to take away someone’s advantage or perhaps to make someone feel less confident. In this case, Pab lo is trying to make sure the press doesn’t ask embarrassing or critical question s by answering their questions “up front.” To do something “up front” is to do it at the beginning, before something else happens.  

If you’re going to rent an apartment in the United States, usually you have to give the first month’s rent “up front” before you actual ly move into the apartment. Not only the first month’s rent, but usually an additio nal amount of money in case you cause some damage to the apartment. But we’re not t alking about apartments here. We’re talking about answering questions befor e people ask them.  

Pablo then asks if any of the members of his meetin g have any questions. Suzanna says that she’s read through the talking po ints, but she’s not sure how to answer one “key,” or important, question. Pablo says, “What’s that?” meaning “What question?” Suzanna says, “Have we solved the huge issue that’s the  

cause of our current problems?” In other words, has  the company actually solved the problem about which the media is going to be as king questions?  

Pablo says, “It goes without saying that if the med ia ever wants a straightforward answer, our response is always ‘no comment.’’’ “It goes without saying” is an expression we use when we are stating something tha t is obvious, something that everyone should already know. “It goes without  saying that if you come to California, you should bring a hat and sunscreen to  put on your skin because we have a lot of sun.” That’s something that we assume  everyone knows. “It goes without saying,” Pablo says, “that if the media eve r wants a straightforward answer, our response is always ‘no comment.’”  

A “straightforward (straightforward) answer” is a d irect and honest answer, a clear answer. The media will ask questions and want  an honest answer, and if that happens, Pablo says, “Our response is always ‘ no comment.’” “No comment” is a phrase used when you don’t want to answer a re porter’s question. You don’t want to answer questions from the newspaper or the television station or the magazine that is asking you questions. It’s a phras e that politicians and businesspeople often use when they are asked questi ons that they don’t want to answer.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
