This episode is a dialogue between Kathryn and Mart in about describing how long things are. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Kathryn: Are you still watching that movie? It’s be en over three hours! 

Martin: Yeah, it’s a little long for a feature film .  

Kathryn: A little long?! It’s interminable. How can  you continue to watch it? 

Martin: Well, the first half was interesting and mo ved at a clip. The middle section did drag a little, but it’s picked up again. It’s n early over. 

Kathryn: I would’ve turned it off long before this.  I like movies that are short and sweet. After about 90 minutes, my mind starts to wa nder, and after two hours, I check out. 

Martin: It depends on the movie. Sometimes I watch a movie and it’s so engrossing that time zips by. With other movies, th ough, time moves at a snail’s pace. This movie is somewhere in between. 

Kathryn: Hey, the credits are rolling. You missed t he ending.  

Martin: No big loss. I knew how it was going to end  after the first hour. 

Kathryn: Then why did you stick it out and watch th e rest of the movie? 

Martin: One word: procrastination.  

 Kathryn: Ah, enough said. 

[end of dialogue] 

Kathryn begins the dialogue by asking Martin, “Are you still watching that movie? It’s been over three hours!” Martin says, “Yeah, it ’s a little long for a feature film.” A “feature (feature) film” is a regular movie – the  kind of movie you would go to a movie theater to see. Feature films are normally be tween 90 and perhaps 200 minutes. It depends on the movie, but somewhere bet ween an hour and a half and two and a half hours, though sometimes movies a re longer than that.  

Kathryn says, “A little long?! It’s interminable.” Kathryn thinks this movie, which has been going for more than three hours now, is no t just a little long – it’s really long. In fact, she calls it “interminable” (intermi nable). Something that is interminable goes on forever, or it seems to never end. I’ve been on some dates like that – when you go out with someone romantical ly, and the evening isn’t going very well, and then it seems interminable, li ke it’s never going to end. It does end eventually, however.  

Kathryn says, “How can you continue to watch it?” H ow can you continue to watch this long movie? Martin says, “Well, the firs t half” – meaning the first 50 percent of the movie – “was interesting and moved a t a clip.” “To move at a clip” (clip), or “to move along at a clip,” means to adva nce very quickly, to move very rapidly. If a movie is moving quickly, a lot of thi ngs are happening in the movie.  

The middle section of the movie, according to Marti n, “did drag a little, but it’s picked up again.” “To drag” (drag) means to go very  slowly, too slowly – so slow that it is a little boring. Martin says the movie h as “picked up again.” “To pick (pick) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to increase in  speed, to start to go faster. Martin says the movie is “nearly over,” meaning it’ s almost over. “It’s nearly (nearly) over.”  

Kathryn says, “I would’ve turned it off long before  this.” Kathryn means that if she had been watching the movie, she would have turned the movie off a long time ago. She would not have continued watching it for t his long. She says, “I like movies that are short and sweet.” The expression “t o be short and sweet” means to not take very long and to be pleasant. Usually w e use this expression “short and sweet” when we want someone to get to the point  right away, or to not go on for very long. “Let’s keep this short and sweet,” m eaning let’s do this very quickly and not waste a lot of time.  

Kathryn says, “After about 90 minutes, my mind star ts to wander, and after two hours, I check out.” If you say your mind “starts t o wander” (wander), you mean that you cannot concentrate or focus on something. Your mind begins to think of other things. If you are sitting in a meeting at wo rk, and the person who’s speaking is very boring or is going on for a very l ong time, your mind might start to wander. You might start thinking about what you’ re going to have for dinner that night or where you’re going to go on vacation next summer. You’re not focusing or concentrating on what you are supposed to be focusing on. 

Kathryn says after two hours of watching a movie, s he checks out. “To check (check) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop paying attention to something, to no longer focus on what you’re suppos ed to focus on. Martin says, for him, “It depends on the movie. Sometimes I watc h a movie and it’s so engrossing that time zips by.” “To be engrossing” ( engrossing) means to be very interesting, to be so interesting that you can’t fo cus on anything else. If you’re reading an engrossing novel, you don’t want to put it down.  

Often, when you are really interested in something,  you go into what psychologists sometimes described as a “state of fl ow” (flow). “To be in flow” means to be so completely focused and concentrated on something that you don’t realize how much time you’re spending on it. That’s why Martin says that if the movie is engrossing, “time zips by.” “To zip (z ip) by” means to go very quickly. A more common expression would be “time fl ies.” There’s an expression, “Time flies when you’re having fun,” and that’s exa ctly what we’re talking about here.  

Martin says, “With other movies, though, time moves  at a snail’s pace.” The opposite of time flying by or zipping by is for it to move at a “snail’s (snail’s) pace (pace).” The “pace” of something is how fast or slo w it’s going. A “snail” is a small animal that moves very, very slowly. If you say som ething is moving at a “snail’s pace,” you mean it is moving very slowly.  

Martin says this movie – the movie he’s watching no w – is somewhere in between. If something is “somewhere in between,” it  is in the middle. It is not at one end or the other. In this case, it isn’t moving  very quickly, but it isn’t moving very slowly, either. Kathryn says, “Hey, the credit s are rolling.” At the end of a movie, there are typically a few minutes where they  tell you who participated in the movie – who the actors were, who the director w as, and so forth. These are called the “credits” (credits). To say “the credits  are rolling” means the credits are showing on the screen.  

Kathryn says, “You missed the ending.” The “ending”  is the very end of the movie. Martin doesn’t seem too concerned. He says, “No big loss.” That expression, “no big loss,” is an informal one that means that it isn’t a very important. You don’t need to worry about it. Martin  says, “I knew how it” – the movie – “was going to end after the first hour.” Ka thryn asks, “Then why did you stick it out and watch the rest of the movie?” “To stick something out” is a phrasal verb meaning to not give up, to continue doing some thing even though it might be difficult.  

Kathryn wants to know why, if Martin knew the end o f the movie after the first hour, he continued to watch it. Martin says, “One w ord: procrastination.” “Procrastination” (procrastination) is when you wai t to do something later instead of doing it now. We might also use the phrasal verb  “to put off” something. “Never do today what you can put off until tomorrow.” That  means don’t do anything today that you can wait and do tomorrow. To wait to  do things – usually because you’re lazy or you don’t want to work very hard – i s called “procrastination.”  

Kathryn understands completely what Martin is sayin g here. She says, “Ah, enough said.” When you say, “enough said,” you’re i ndicating that you understand completely what the other person is tell ing you, so much so that the other person doesn’t have to finish explaining it. You already understand what they’re saying. You’re saying to the person, “You d on’t need to say any more. You don’t need to explain anything else. I understa nd it. I get it.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
