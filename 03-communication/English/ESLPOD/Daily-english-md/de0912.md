This episode is a dialogue between Cody and Jada ab out someone who works to try to influence public policy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Cody:  You’re not the kind of person I would expect  to work as a lobbyist.

Jada:  Why not?

Cody:  I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy a nd corrupt, using underhanded tactics.

Jada:  It’s not like that at all, at least not for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.

Cody:  So what do you do exactly?

Jada:  I meet with legislators and try to sway them  to support laws that are favorable to the people and companies I represent, and to discourage them from voting for laws that aren’t.

Cody:  You’re a spokesperson for your clients, then .

Jada:  I’m more than that.  I work for clients in the private sector and in corporations, as well as for special interest group s.  I advocate for what would benefit my clients in a way that they can’t do them selves directly.

Cody:  Isn’t there sometimes a conflict of interest ?  Let’s say your client this month wants a law passed and your client next month  doesn’t.  What happens then?

 Jada:  I’m a gun for hire.  I do my best for my cli ent, whichever that client is at that moment.

Cody:  I’m glad to hear you say that.  I could use the services of a good lobbyist. I’ve been trying to get my wife to agree to buy a n ew boat...

Jada:  Stop right there.  In this case there is a c onflict of interest.  Your wife talked to me last week and wants me to have a littl e talk with you about that new boat...

Cody begins by saying, “You're not the kind of pers on I would expect to work as a lobbyist.” A “lobbyist” (lobbyist) is someone who  works with government officials, usually elected government officials, an d tries to get them to vote a certain way on some law or some regulation. “Lobbyi sts” work to try to influence what we call “public policy,” the government's poli cy or the government's actions about a certain topic. Cody is saying to Jada that he did not expect her to work as a lobbyist. I should mention also: the verb is “ to lobby” (lobby). That means to try to influence a government official.

Jada says, “Why not?” Why didn't you expect me to w ork as a lobbyist? Cody says, “I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy a nd corrupt, using underhanded tactics.” The verb “to picture” (picture) means to imagine something in a certain way, to have an image or picture of something in yo ur head. Cody says that he “pictures” lobbyists as being “kind of,” or sort of , or somewhat, “pushy and corrupt.” “To be pushy” (pushy) means to be very as sertive, we might say “aggressive,” forceful, someone who insists on gett ing their way, insists that everyone agree with them. That would be a pushy per son.

“Corrupt” (corrupt) means that you are doing someth ing wrong. You are lying. You are cheating. You are doing something to get in fluence, usually with a government official, although not always. Cody says  that he pictures lobbyists as being pushy and corrupt and using “underhanded tact ics.” A “tactic” (tactic) is an approach, a method or strategy, roughly speaking. “ Underhanded” means dishonest, unfair. We might also use the word “snea ky” (sneaky). “Underhanded tactics” would be doing something in an unfair or d ishonest way.

Jada says, “It's not like that at all, at least not  for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.” This phrase, “power s of persuasion,” refers to your ability to change other people's opinions or d ecisions by telling them

information that will change their mind, or giving them another option, another way of doing whatever they're trying to do. Cody says, “So what do you do exactly?” The word “e xactly means here “precisely,” in detail. Tell me what you do from th is moment to this moment, or this day to this day. Jada says, “I meet with legis lators and try to sway them to support laws that are favorable to the people and c ompanies I represent.” “Legislators” (legislators) are people who are elec ted as representatives of the people. Representatives in a state government or re presentatives in our national government can both be called “legislators.” The ve rb “to legislate” means to make a law. So, legislators are people who make law s.

Jada says, “I meet with legislators and try to sway  them.” “To sway” (sway) means to persuade, to convince, to change someone's  opinion about something. Jada tries to persuade or “sway” these legislators to support laws, or to vote for laws, that are favorable to the people and companie s she represents. “Favorable” (favorable) means useful, beneficial, h elping. We might also use the word “advantageous” – something positive for a cert ain person or group. Jada wants the laws to be favorable to the people she re presents. “To represent” typically means to go in the place of someone else.  So instead of you going and talking to the legislator, you send a representativ e who will “represent” you. The lobbyists represents and works for the people who g ive her money to talk to legislators. Jada says she also works to “discourag e” legislators from voting for laws that are not favorable. “To discourage” means to get them to not  do something.

Cody says, “You're a spokesperson for your clients then?” A “spokesperson” is a general term for someone who speaks for another per son, who speaks in public for another person, someone who might speak to news paper reporters, representing some person or company. That person is  called a “spokesperson.” The traditional words were “spokesman” and “spokesw oman,” but a more general term used sometimes now is “spokes person .”

Jada says, “I'm more than that,” meaning I do more than just speak for my clients or the people I work for. “I work for clients in the private sector and in corporations, as well as for special interest group s.” “The private sector” (sector) refers to businesses and corporations, something th at is not the government. We call the government the “public sector.” The privat e sector is everyone who is not in or part of the government.

Jada says she works for clients in the public secto r and in corporations – although corporations are be part of the private se ctor – as well as for “special interest groups.” A “special interest group” is an organization, usually, that

represents a whole group of companies or group of p eople who have some common interest. For example, there may be many dif ferent companies that grow corn in the United States, many different indi vidual farmers who grow corn. They might have a group that gets together and send s a lobbyist to Washington to try to get laws that will favor those companies and those farmers. That group would be called a “special interest group” because they all have the same interest, the same concern. Jada says that she “adv ocates” for what would benefit her clients. “To advocate” (advocate) means  to speak on behalf of a group of people and say what should be done – to speak for a group of people trying to get changes in the way something works.

Cody says, “Isn’t there sometimes a conflict of int erest?” A “conflict of interest” is a situation where what you say publicly, or what yo u do publicly, may disagree with or cause problems with things you do privately . For example, if I own a bunch of land, a lot of land, in a certain area and  I am also a government representative, for me to pass laws about how that land is going to be used would be a “conflict of interest.” I have two diffe rent things that I'm responsible for: I'm responsible as a government official, but I'm also responsible as a person who owns the land. So, my interests will perhaps co nflict or not agree.

Cody says, “Let's say your client this month wants a law passed, and your client next month doesn't.” Cody is saying that if Jada ha s one company she's working for that wants a law in a certain way, or written in a certain way, and then the next month she has a new company who wants the law written in a different way, isn't this a conflict of interest? Notice Cody uses  the expression “Let's say.” “Let's say” means, “for example.”

Jada said, “I’m a gun for hire.” This expression “I 'm a gun (gun) for hire (hire)” means literally that you are a person who is given money to go and kill someone, but that's not what Jada is talking about. We use t his expression more generally to mean someone who is given money, who is hired, to solve a certain problem, and this person will work for anyone who wants that  problem solved, even people who have different interests, even when there is a conflict of interest.

Jada says, “I do the best for my client, whichever that client is at that moment,” or at that time. Cody says “I'm glad to hear you say t hat. I could use the services of a good lobbyist. I've been trying to get my wife to  agree to buy a new boat.” Cody is making a joke, of course. You don't send someone  else like a lobbyist to change your wife's mind. The way you do that is by going to the jewelry store. Cody needs to learn a little about marriage here!

Jada says, “Stop right there,” meaning stop talking . “In this case, there is a conflict of interest,” she says. “Your wife talked to me last week and wants me to have a little talk” – or conversation – “with you a bout that new boat.” What she's saying is that Cody's wife talked to her and has al ready asked her to influence Cody, so she can't represent both parties, or both people, at the same time.

Of course, she's making a joke also, because “lobby ist” isn't a word we would use to describe someone in this situation. We use “ lobbyist” only to describe someone who is trying to influence a government off icial, not your wife.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
