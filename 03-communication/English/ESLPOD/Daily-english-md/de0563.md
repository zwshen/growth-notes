This episode is a dialogue between Roland and Ginger a bout “household expenses,” the money that you have to spend to live in a h ouse or apartment. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Roland:  If we want to save enough money to buy a hous e, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial plannin g.  I think the first step is to create a household budget. 

Ginger:  Okay by me.  You know that I’m all about the bottom line. 

Roland:  Yeah, right.  I think we have a pretty good i dea of our spending patterns, so it shouldn’t be too hard to come up with a budget t hat we can both live with.   

Ginger:  Right. 

Roland:  Okay, one thing we need to keep in mind is th at we tend to underestimate our monthly expenses.  If you look at our d iscretionary spending on this spreadsheet I created, you’ll be surprised at ho w much money we spend on nonessentials. 

Ginger:  Okay, I can cut back on nonessentials. 

Roland:  You can?    

 Ginger:  Sure, instead of getting my nails done every we ek, I’ll get them done only three times a month. 

Roland:  Well, that’s a start… 

Ginger:  And instead of buying a new 60-inch TV, we can  get a 52-inch one instead.  That should save us a lot of money. 

Roland:  I think you need to do the math.  If we don’ t cut back much more drastically, we’ll be ready for retirement by the time w e can afford a house! 

[end of dialogue] 

Roland begins by saying to Ginger, “If we want to save en ough money to buy a house, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial planning.”  Roland and Ginger want to buy a house; t hey need to save their money, so they need to “get serious about,” or focus on, be concentrated on, and actually do things related to their finances.  Your “fin ances” are how you manage your money, the way you save and spend, the amount of mo ney that you save and spend.  “Financial planning” is the process of sittin g down and thinking about your future and the money that you will need.  When you  retire, how much money you will have to live on?  If your child is going to go  to college, how much money will you need to send them there?  The answer is a lot !   

Well, Roland says that he thinks the “first step,” the fir st thing they should do, is create a household budget.  “Household” refers to everyon e who lives in your house, apartment, or condominium: the father, the mot her, the children, maybe grandma, maybe grandpa, and so forth.  A “budget” i s a plan about how much you are going to spend for different things – how much are we going to spend for food, how much are we going to spend for gasoline for  our car, and so forth. 

Ginger says, “Okay by me (meaning yes, I agree).  You know that I’m all about the bottom line.”  The expression “to be all about (som ething)” means to be very interested in something, very involved, perhaps, in somethi ng.  I’m all about the Dodger baseball team; I love to watch the Dodgers her e in Los Angeles.  Ginger is all about the bottom line.  The “bottom line” ref ers to the amount of money that you have at the end of a certain period – how much did you spend, how much did you save.  Did you spend more than you saved, or did you sa ve more than you spent?  I should mention that “about” as a preposition  is used with a lot of  

 different verbs and idioms (phrasal verbs); take a look a t the Learning Guide for some more information about that one. 

Roland says, “Yeah, right.  I think we have a pretty goo d idea of our spending patterns.”  Your “spending patterns” are the ways in wh ich you spend money.  A “pattern” is something that happens usually repeatedly ove r time.  You always spend about this much money every month on food, this much money on cable television, this much money on Starbucks coffee, and so fort h.  Roland says, “it shouldn’t be too hard (too difficult) to come up wit h (to write down) a budget that we can both live with (that we both agree to follow). ”  Ginger says, “Right,” meaning I agree. 

Roland says, “Okay, one thing we need to keep in mind (me aning one thing we need to remember) is that we tend to underestimate o ur monthly expenses.” “We tend to” means we usually “underestimate.”  “To e stimate” means to guess approximately how much of something that you need or wa nt.  “To underestimate” means to guess or believe that something i s smaller, or less, or perhaps less important than it actually is.  So if you say,  “Oh, I estimate I spend 10 dollars a month on gasoline,” and you actually spend 100 dollars a month on gasoline, well, then you are underestimating.  The opp osite would be, of course, “to overestimate,” to guess too high rather than too lo w.  Roland says that he and Ginger underestimate their monthly expenses.  “Expense” is money that is spent on something.  The money that you give to other people for something, that’s an expense. 

Roland says, “If you look at our discretionary spending on t his spreadsheet I created, you’ll be surprised at how much money we spend o n nonessentials.” “Discretionary” means optional, something you have a choice about, something you could do or not do.  “Discretionary spending” is mone y that you don’t have to spend; money that you could save or spend, depending on you r decision.  A “spreadsheet” is an electronic document, usually created b y a program such as Excel or Lotus or other software, that’s used to store num bers and to make calculations about things – numerical things.  So, what R oland has done is made a spreadsheet on the computer of how much they spend, and he says they spend a lot of money on nonessentials.  Something that i s “essential” is something you must have.  Food and water are essentials for human life. “Nonessentials” are things you don’t need.  A 56-inch f lat screen television is a nonessential; human beings can actually live without one.   I know that’s hard to believe for some of you!  Computers are really essential for many people in their jobs and businesses; they’re not nonessential, at least they’ re not for me.  

 Ginger says, “Okay, I can cut back (I can spend less) on nonessen tials.”  Roland says, somewhat surprised, “You can?”  Ginger says, “Sure, inst ead of getting my nails done every week, I’ll get them done only three ti mes a month.”  “To get your nails done” is to go to a place where they shape and p aint your fingernails and toenails, something that women usually do – and some rock stars!  What Ginger is saying is that instead of going every week to get her n ails done, she’ll only go three times a month, not four times a month.  Roland  says, “Well, that’s a start (that’s a beginning).”  Ginger then says, “And instead of buying a new 60-inch TV (that is, a television where the screen is 60 inches measur ing diagonally, from one corner to the other, opposite corner), we can get a  52-inch one instead.  That should save us a lot of money.”  Of course, these are not  very important sacrifices; you’re not going to save a lot of money doing t hese sorts of things.   

Roland says, “I think you need to do the math.”  When som eone says “do the math,” they mean look at the numbers, calculate, add and  subtract, figure out exactly what the numbers are.  “Do the math.”  “Math” i s short for mathematics. Here, it means really do the calculations.  “If we don’t  cut back much more drastically, we’ll be ready for retirement by the time w e can afford a house!”  “To cut back,” as I mentioned earlier, means to reduce, to de crease the amount of something.  The verb “cut” has several meanings in English;  “to cut back” is a phrasal verb, but there are other ways of using this verb that are explained in the Learning Guide.  Roland says that they have to cut back dra stically.  “Drastically” means in a big way, a lot.  If they do not, they’ll be ready for retirement by the time they can afford a house.  “Retirement” is when you quit your job, usually after you’re 55-60-65 years old, and you don’t work anymo re.  In the United States, it’s typical around the age of 65, though some p eople retire earlier and some later.  “To afford” means to be able to pay for so mething.  Roland is saying that they won’t be able to buy a house for many, many yea rs unless they cut back much more drastically. 

Now we’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.
