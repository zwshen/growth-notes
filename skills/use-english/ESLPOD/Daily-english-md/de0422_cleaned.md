This episode is called “Shopping for Underwear.”  Everyo ne – well, almost every one wears underwear, and this is a dialogue that gives yo u some vocabulary about buying underwear for both men and women.  Let’ s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Kerry:  We’re almost done with the shopping.  We just n eed some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me. 

Russell:  It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’s u nderwear, but do I have to go into the lingerie store?  All of the women  in the store laugh at me. 

Kerry:  No, they don’t.  I just need a few things.  He re we are.  Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, t oo.  Do you see any in a B cup?   

Russell:  I’m not helping you look.  I’m standing over h ere where nobody can see me.   

Kerry:  Fine.  Let’s see, I need some panties and a slip , too.  Oh, these pantyhose are on sale.   

Russell:  Can you please hurry up?  That woman over there  is snickering. 

Kerry:  She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfortab le.  Okay, I’m done. Let’s go get your underwear. 

 Russell:  Thank God!  I just need some new boxers with a comfortable waistband and a button fly. 

Kerry:  I thought you liked the boxer briefs I bought b efore, you know, the seamless ones. 

Russell:  I tried them, but they were too small.  I thi nk I’d actually like to try some regular briefs.  Here are some over here. 

Kerry:  You’d better look again.  Those are g-strings.  If you insist on buying those, it’ll be my turn to hide. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Kerry saying to Russell, “We’r e almost done with the shopping.  We just need some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me.”  “Underwear” is the clothing you wear underneath your regular clothing.  It’s clothing that you don’t normally see.  Kerry says she needs to get some underwear for Russell and some unmentionables for hersel f.  To “mention” something is to say something.  If you say it is “unmention able” that means that you shouldn’t or don’t say it.  In this case, Kerry is simpl y making a joke, “unmentionables” is just a funny way to refer to underw ear.  The joke is that it’s somehow inappropriate to talk about underwear in a con versation, so she makes a little joke and says “unmentionables.” 

Russell says, “It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’ s underwear.”  So, a woman can buy underwear for a man in a store.  “But, ” he says, “do I have to go into the lingerie store?  All of the women in the  store laugh at me.”  So Russell, who’s a man, is embarrassed by going into the wom en’s underwear store.  A women’s underwear story is sometimes called a “l ingerie (lingerie) store.”  “Lingerie” actually refers to women’s underwear , but sometimes it refers also to fancy, expensive, perhaps sexy clothing that a woman m ight wear as underwear.   

Russell doesn’t want to go into the lingerie store.  Ke rry says that the women are not laughing at Russell.  She says, “I just need a few th ings,” and they walk into the store.  “Here we are,” she says, “Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, too.”  A “bra” (bra) is a type of underwear that a woman wears; it goes over her shoulders.  They have what are ca lled “straps,” and these straps go over the shoulders, and in the front of the bo dy, the bra is there to  

 support the woman’s breasts.  So, it’s the chest of a woma n where you will find a bra.  Men, typically, do not wear bras – most men, the m en I know! 

The bra that Kerry is looking for has an underwire.  An  “underwire” is a piece of metal that is sewn into – that is made as part of the b ra to provide extra support for large breasts, shall we say.  Kerry says she also needs a strapless bra. Remember I said that there are these things that go ove r the shoulder, they connect the front of the bra to the back, so they help ho ld up the breasts.  The “strapless” bras are bras that don’t have this strap goin g over the shoulder. Usually it’s a dress that is strapless or a bra that is strapl ess, so you don’t see anything on the woman’s shoulder. 

Kerry then asks Russell, “Do you see any (any bras) in a B cup? ”  A “cup” is a part of the bra that is round and that fits over one b reast.  Cups come in different sizes because, of course, women have different sized breasts, or least that’s what people tell me.  Now that I’m married, I don’t  look at other women any more! The bras come in cups sizes from triple A (AAA), which is t he smallest to triple D (DDD), which is the biggest.  Most women are somewhere i n between there: A cup, B cup, C cup, maybe D cup.  But, well, women come in  all different sizes, so there are all different sizes of bras.  Isn’t this excitin g?! 

Now, Russell says, “I’m not helping you look.  I’m standing  over here where nobody can see me.”  So, Russell is embarrassed.  Kerry sa ys, “Fine.  I need some panties and a slip, too.  Oh, these pantyhose are o n sale.”  Kerry says she needs some panties.  “Panties” are the underwear that a woman wears around her waist, over her bottom, and between her legs.  Th at’s “panties.”  We don’t usually call that kind of underwear “panties” for a man , however.  We never do, only for a woman.  A “slip” (slip) is a piece of underwe ar that is like a skirt, and it is supposed be worn under a regular skirt so that you canno t see in between the woman’s legs; it blocks the light.  So, if a woman is wea ring a very thin skirt, she might also wear a slip underneath it to cover up her le gs better.  The word “slip” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Kerry says she also sees some pantyhose.  “Pantyhose” (one word ) are also called “nylons” (nylons).  They’re a type of clothing that  you put on your legs (a woman puts on her legs).  They are made from a very th in material (a thin fabric, we would say) that you can usually see through; they’re oft en brown or black in color.  A woman wears these over her legs, up to her wa ist.  They’re used to make her legs look smooth and evenly colored, especially when  she is wearing a skirt or a dress.  Often they’re used for more formal occasi ons, as well.  

 Russell says, “Can you please hurry up (can you go faster)?   The woman over there is snickering.”  To “snicker” (snicker) means to laugh quietly, usually laughing at another person.  It’s not considered very ni ce to snicker at someone; it’s something that children might do.  They’re laughin g at another person, but not very loudly.  Russell thinks this woman is snickering at him (is laughing at him). Kerry says, “She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfort able.  Okay,” she says, “I’m done (I’m finished).  Let’s go get your underw ear.” 

Russell is very happy to be leaving the lingerie store, or the lingerie section of the store.  He says, “I just need some new boxers with a comf ortable waistband and a button fly.”  “Boxers” are a kind of underwear that a  man and wears around his waist.  Most men only wear one kind of underwear, that goes around the middle of their body, their legs (top of their legs), and the ir waist.  “Boxers” is a particular kind of underwear that is loose, that is not tight.  Th e “waistband” is the part of underwear (either for a man or a woman) or some oth er type of clothing worn around your waist, which is the center of your body.  Thi s is a “expandable” piece of fabric or material, meaning that it will get larg er or smaller depending on how big your waist is.  It helps to keep the clothing from f alling down.  So, you have a waistband on underwear; you may have a waistband on a pa ir of sweat pants. Russell wants a comfortable waistband, one that isn’t too  small, one that isn’t too tight.  He also wants a “button fly.”  A “button” is wh at you use to connect two pieces of clothing.  Usually you have buttons, for example, on the front of a formal shirt.  Your “fly” is the part of a piece of und erwear (for a man) that can be opened and closed.  Men often use the restroom (use the bathroom – the toilet) by standing up.  I think you understand what I mean.  T he fly, then, is used so that a man doesn’t have to take his underwear off when  he wants to use the bathroom.  Russell, then, wants a button fly; he wants a  fly in the front of his underwear that has a button to keep it closed. 

Well, Kerry says, “I thought you liked the boxer briefs I b ought you before, the seamless ones.”  “Briefs” are another kind of underwear f or a man.  They are not loose, but they are tight.  “Boxer briefs” is sort of in  between a boxer and a brief. They’re longer pieces of underwear, but they’re still ti ght around the legs as well as around the waist.  “Seamless” means, literally, withou t seams.  A “seam” is typically a line that is created when you sew two pieces of fabric or material together.  Something that is “seamless,” then, is made w ith one single piece of fabric or one single piece of material. 

Russell said he tried the boxer briefs, “but they were to o small.  I think I’d actually like to try some regular briefs.”  So, Russell is intereste d in wearing a piece of  

 underwear that is usually white, and that is smaller tha n a boxer, and is tight around the legs as well as around the waist.  So, we ha ve three kinds of underwear for men, here.  We have briefs, which are tight around the leg and the waist.  We have boxers, which are tight around the waist  but loose around the legs, and are usually a little longer; they almost look l ike shorts.  And then you have boxer briefs, which is somewhere in between, a combi nation of these two things.  The word “brief” has several different meaning s in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Russell thinks that he has found some briefs in the store,  but Kerry says, “You’d better look again (you better look more carefully).  Tho se are g-strings.”  A “g- string” is a kind of underwear that a woman wears.  It’ s a piece of underwear that doesn’t have any material in the back other than a single  piece of fabric (a single piece of material) that goes up and connects to a very sma ll waistline, so a woman’s behind (a woman’s butt) essentially has no fabric over it.  This is a g- string; some women wear it because they think it’s sexy.  Ag ain, I don’t know! Well, obviously this is not something a man such as Russell wo uld want to buy. That’s why Kerry says, “If you insist on buying those (if you must buy those or say that you have to buy those), it’ll be my turn to hide”  – I’m going to hide because I’ll be embarrassed, just like Russell was embarra ssed going into lingerie store. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue – wasn’t this a fun di alogue?  Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.
