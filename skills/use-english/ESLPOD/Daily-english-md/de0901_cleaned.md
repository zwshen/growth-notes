This episode is a dialogue between Lucinda and Elan  about clinical trials. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialog] 

Lucinda:  You look tired.  Are you all right? 

Elan:  I’m fine.  It’s this clinical trial I’m enro lled in.  I’m suffering from some side effects.   

Lucinda:  Are they serious? 

Elan:  No, they’re not too bad.  I was told to expe ct some adverse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study.  I guess that’s why  only a small group of volunteers is taking part right now.  It’s so they can judge t he drug’s effectiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial. 

Lucinda:  At least you know you’re not in the group  getting a placebo. 

Elan:  Who knows?  I hope not.  If I successfully g et through this first phase, I’ll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.   

Lucinda:  Then you may once and for all be rid of P odcaster’s Disease. 

Elan:  I really hope so.  No one should go through life sounding like a podcaster.

Lucinda begins the dialog by saying, “You look tire d. Are you all right?” – are you okay? Elan says, “I'm fine. It's this clinical tria l I’m enrolled in.” A “clinical trial” is a  

careful testing of some new drug or some new proced ure. They get people who are willing to be tested with this new drug or this  new treatment, and see what happens. In the United States, in order for a drug to be approved for use by the general public, by the average person, the drug com pany has to have these clinical trials to test what the drug does. Elan is  enrolled in a clinical trial. “To be enrolled in something” means to be signed up for so mething, to be registered for something. We often use this verb “to enroll” when talking about school. “I'm going to enroll at the university.” I'm going to si gn up or register to be part of the university.  

Elan says, “I'm suffering from some side effects.” “To suffer from something” means to feel pain or some other negative effect of  some disease, or in this case, drug. A “side effect” is something that happens to your body – a negative thing that happens to your body – when you take a drug, o r undergo some kind of medical treatment. A side effect would be something  that is bad, but is not the same thing as what the disease or illness is. For e xample, you might take a drug to help you with your allergies, to help you so tha t you don't sneeze so much.  

One of the side effects of the drug you take could be drowsiness, making you sleepy. That could happen as a side effect. It's no t the main reason. In fact, it's not the reason at all. You're taking the drug but i t has that side effect on you. It has that other thing that happens. That is not desi rable. 

 Lucinda says, “Are they serious?” – are the side e ffects serious? Elan says, “No, they're not too bad. I was told to expect some adve rse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study.” An “adverse (adverse) reaction ” is a negative result, a negative effect – once again, a term that we usuall y associate with medical treatment. An adverse reaction would be, when you t ake a drug and something negative happens. It's like a side effect. Usually,  I think it's a little more serious than that. An adverse reaction might cause your doc tor to stop giving you the drug.  

Elan said he was told to expect some adverse reacti ons in the first weeks of the pilot study. The “study” is just the trial, the per iod where they are studying this drug. A “pilot study” is a study that is a small ex periment, a small test before the main, larger study. A “pilot study” would involve f ewer people, perhaps for a shorter amount of time in order to see whether the drug was going to work at all and then if you got some positive results from a pi lot study, then you would do a larger study, the main study. 

Elan says, “I guess that's why only a small group o f volunteers are taking part right now.” A “volunteer” (volunteer)” is someone w ho agrees to do something  

either for free or without being required to do it.  You could ask for volunteers for something at your work, even though the person is b eing paid for it. We could consider them a volunteer because they don't have t o say yes.  

Volunteers always have the option of not doing some thing. In many contexts, however, volunteer means not getting paid for somet hing. You do it just because you want to help. That would be one reason. This is  a volunteer for a pilot study. It's not clear to me that they are doing it for fre e. However, they could've just volunteered in the sense of agreeing to do it witho ut being required to do it. This small group of volunteers is taking part right now.  “To take part” means to participate, to have a role in something. I'm takin g part in the activity this afternoon. I'm going to be part of it. I'm going to  participate in it. These volunteers are taking part in the study.  

Elan says, “It's so they can judge the drug’s effec tiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial.” T he drug is the medicine. “Effectiveness” would refer to whether it does what  it says it is supposed to do – whether it works. “Pharmaceutical” refers to a comp any related to making drugs and medicine. “Large-scale” means a lot of people, a lot of people involved in the study trial. “Trial,” remember, means the same as s tudy. So, Elan says that there are only a few volunteers taking part so that the d rug company, the pharmaceutical company, can decide whether the drug  is going to work or not, before they have a large-scale trial.  

Lucinda says, “At least you know you're not in a gr oup getting a placebo.” A “placebo” (placebo) is something you are given in a  clinical trial that looks like a drug, or it looks like medicine, but it's not reall y. It's nothing that would help you or hurt you. The reason that they use placebos in c linical trials is to test to make sure that people are not getting better for psychol ogical reasons, rather than for physical reasons. So, the placebo is given to a gro up of people who aren’t told, of course, that it's not the real drug.  

Elan says, “Who knows?” meaning “Who knows whether I'm getting a placebo or not?” “I hope not. If I successfully get through th is first phase I'll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.” “Phase” (phase) here – it j ust means stage or step or a period, one part of something. A drug trial, a drug  study, could have a number of different phases. The first phase is the pilot stud y. The second phase could be a large-scale trial. The third phase could be another  large-scale trial and so forth. So, phase is just a general term for a period or st age or step.  

A “dose of a drug” is an amount of medicine that yo u usually take at one time. If you have a headache, the doctor might tell you to t ake two aspirin. That would be  

your dose – two aspirin. There’s an old joke, the d octor will tell you, “Take two aspirin and call me in the morning. If you come in and complain about something.” The idea is the doctor doesn't really w ant to help you and is just trying to get rid of you.  

Lucinda says to Elan, “Then you may once and for al l be rid of Podcaster’s disease.” “Once and for all” means finally, conclus ively, without any remaining amount that is not done. “Once and for all” is the end of something. Lucinda says that Elan may once and for all be rid of Podcaster’ s disease. “To be rid of something” means to no longer have something, espec ially something that you don't really want or like or that is unpleasant. I am finally rid of my neighbor’s dog. The dog is no longer at my neighbor's house. I am r id of the dog.  

Podcaster’s disease is when a person can't stop tal king and they always talk like they are producing a podcast. That is what Elan has . Elan says, “No one should go through life” – no one should live – “sounding l ike a podcaster.” Personally, Elan, I think it's the best thing that could happen  to you. You should be so lucky as to have Podcaster’s disease. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
