This episode is called “Getting Around Regulations.”  It ’s a dialogue between Michael and Leona that talks about laws, rules, regulati ons that all of us have to follow at some point in our life.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

Michael:  I have some qualms about how we’re handling these accounts.

Leona:  What do you mean?

Michael:  There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re violating those regulations.

Leona:  Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation.  We’ re not flouting any regulations. We’re just not following the letter of the law.

Michael:  I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line.   I’m not against some creative accounting, but what we’re doing is bordering o n criminal.

Leona:  Aren’t you blowing things out of proportion?   The government makes laws knowing that people are going to try to get aroun d them.  There are always loopholes and that’s why they turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities. As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.

Michael:  I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t share  it.  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do b usiness.

 Leona:  Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see what we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Michael saying, “I have some qua lms about how we’re handling these accounts.”  “Qualm” (qualm) is when you d on’t feel right about something; you think that something is wrong, something,  perhaps, is even dangerous.  Usually it has to do with things that you are  doing that are against the law or perhaps against some rule or regulation.  M ichael has some qualms about how he and Leona are handling, or dealing wit h, certain accounts, perhaps certain customers that they have, or certain financial ar rangements.

Leona says, “What do you mean?”  Michael says, “There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re  violating those regulations.”  “Regulation” is just another word for a rule or a law, something you can do or not do.  Governments have regulations; compani es sometimes have regulations about what you can wear to work or not wea r to work, what you can do and not do at your job.  Michael says, “There are stri ct (meaning there are very specific and serious) regulations governing what we can  do and not do.” “To govern” is to control, to have authority or power ove r something, to lead something.  The president governs the country; the govern or governs the state (the leader of a state is called a governor).  “To gover n” is the verb; it means to be in authority, in this case to rule over or to control  a certain thing.  In this case it’s regulations that are governing what you can do and  not do – are telling you what you can do and not do.  Michael says, “I think we’re violating those regulations.”  Here, “to violate” means to break a rul e, to break the law, to go against something, to do something that is not allowed .

Leona says, “Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation,” m eaning it depends on how you understand something, how it’s explained to you; some  people could see it one way; other people could see it another.  “Interpre tation” has a couple of different meanings however, so take a look at our Learni ng Guide for some additional explanations.  Leona says, “We’re not floutin g any regulations.”  “To flout” (flout) means to break a law or to go against a  rule without hiding your actions, without even trying to hide what you are doing,  you’re just doing it very openly.  Usually it’s to show that you don’t respect this l aw or this regulation, you don’t agree with it.  Leona says, “We’re not to flouti ng any regulations.  We’re just not following the letter of the law.”  “To follow the letter of the law” means to obey a law exactly, to do exactly what a law says.  The opposite would be to follow the spirit of the law.  “To follow the spirit of the law”  means to do what you think the

 law is trying to accomplish, what you think the law means.  To follow the letter of the law means to do exactly what the law says, word by wo rd.

Michael says, “I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the lin e.”  “I, for one” means I, among everyone here, and perhaps there are more peopl e like me who agree with me.  He’s sort of setting himself apart, he’s saying  well, that’s your opinion, but my opinion is different.  “I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line.”  “To cross the line” means to do something that is breaking a r egulation, that is going against a law, that is going too far, too extreme.  So metimes we use this expression when someone does something that they think is su pposed to be funny but it isn’t really funny, it may be mean or cruel.   They’ve crossed the line; they’ve crossed the line separating humor from cruelty for example, someone who has gone too far.

Michael says, “I’m not against some creative accounting, but  what we’re doing is bordering on criminal.”  The expression “creative account ing” was originally, and still is sort of a comical expression, something that’s supp osed to be funny. “Creative accounting” means to report financial informa tion, in this case in a way that will make the company seen profitable.  In other w ords, you do some tricks with the numbers; you report them in such a way that thi ngs look better for your company than they really are.  That’s creative accounting.  “Accounting” is the organization of your company’s money, it’s keeping track of – it’s keeping your records of how much money you’re making, how much money you’ re spending, and so forth.  Creative accounting, then, is doing thin gs with that account to make yourself better than you really are.

Michael says, “what we’re doing is bordering on criminal. ”  “To border on (something)” is to be almost doing something, to be very close to being or doing something.  “My singing is so bad it borders on painful,”  meaning to hear me sing is to experience pain it’s so bad – it borders on painfu l.  Not painful, but borders on painful – almost painful.  That’s what most people  tell me!  The word “border” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learn ing Guide for some additional explanations of that word.

Leona says, “Aren’t you blowing things out of proportio n?”  “To blow things out of portion” means to treat something as if it were more i mportant or more significant than it really is, to consider something very important wh en it isn’t very important. Your friend says that she’s going to call you at 10:00 in the morning, and instead she calls you at 10:15, 15 minutes later.  You talk to he r and you get all angry, you yell at her, you’re very upset.  She might say, “You’re  blowing things out of proportion,” you’re making this small thing much more i mportant, much bigger than it really is.

 Leona says, “The government makes laws knowing that people  are going to try to get around them.”  Leona has some interesting ide as about ethics and morals, here.  She says the government makes laws knowing that pe ople are going to try to break them, that people are going to try to find w ays not to obey them, not to do what they say.  “To get around (something),” here, m eans to find a way to not have to do something.  She says, “There are always loopho les.”  A “loophole” is something that is written into a law or regulation th at lets some people not have to do what other people have to do, it’s like an excepti on.

She says that there are always loopholes, and that’s why w e turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities.  “To be blind” means you  can’t see.  The expression “to turn a blind eye” means to pretend not to  see or notice something, especially when someone is doing something wrong.  You j ust look the other way, you pretend like it’s not happening.  She says, “As lo ng as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.”  “To comply” means to follow a rule or a law.  She says, “As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot  water.”  “To get into hot water” means to get into a situation where you are in trouble  because, perhaps, you broke the law or broke a particular rule or regulation .  Sometimes you can get in hot water, for example, with your wife because you said you would call her at 10:00 and you didn’t.  That would get you into hot wa ter – at least it would get me into hot water!

Michael says, “I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t s hare it (I don’t agree with you).  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do business.”  To say you’re “in for” means that you are going to have, you are going to experience in the future.

Leona says, “Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see wh at we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.”  Your “conscience” is the  part of your thinking that tells you whether something is right or w rong.  “To be overactive” means to be too active, to be too sensitive perhaps.  So a n “overactive conscience” would be someone who thinks everything they’re doing is wrong. One has to wonder who has the overactive conscience and w ho has the under- active conscience in this dialogue!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, at a normal sp eed.

Michael:  I have some qualms about how we’re handling these accounts.

 Leona:  What do you mean?

Michael:  There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re violating those regulations.

Leona:  Aren’t you blowing things out of proportion?   The government makes laws knowing that people are going to try to get aroun d them.  There are always loopholes and that’s why they turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities. As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.

Michael:  I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t share  it.  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do b usiness.

Leona:  Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see what we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.
