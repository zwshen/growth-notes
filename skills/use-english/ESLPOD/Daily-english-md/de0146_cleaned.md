# Suggestions at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 146 – Suggestions at Work.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 146. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

In this podcast, we’re going to talk about giving o ur ideas or suggestions in a business environment. Let's get started.  

[start of dialog] 

Our company has been growing very quickly and I was  put in charge of reorganizing our office space to accommodate severa l new employees. I asked my co-worker, Petra, for her advice. 

Fernando: I was thinking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices. What do you think about that?  

Petra: Well, it seems to me that doing that would o nly solve part of the problem. Have you considered converting the conference room into offices? 

Fernando: I'm not sure that will work. We don't hav e another meeting space if we do that. What are your thoughts on turning the coff ee room into one large office with cubicles? 

Petra: In my opinion, that's not going to be a very  popular solution.  

Fernando: The way I see it, there are no easy solut ions and that may be the best one. Do you have any other suggestions?  

Petra: No, none that would really work. In my opini on, the only solution is to divide up the executive offices. But, I know, I kno w. That's not going to happen. My suggestion is to ask a few more of the old emplo yees. Maybe they'll think of something. 

Fernando: I think you're right. It's not going to b e an easy decision and I can use all the help I can get.

 Our story begins with Fernando saying that our “com pany has been growing very quickly and I was put in charge of reorganizing our  office space to accommodate several new employees.” So the company has been gro wing. It’s been getting bigger. They have been hiring or bringing in new em ployees and Fernando was put in charge of reorganizing the office space. “To  be put in charge of something” means to be made the person responsible for a certa in task or activity. If you are put in charge of a celebration, or of a meeting, or  of any sort of activity, you are the boss. You are the person who needs to be respon sible. You are the person who is supposed to get it done.  

Fernando is supposed to reorganize the office space . “To reorganize” means to organize again. That prefix “re” means to do again.  In this case, it means probably to move some desks from one location to an other, to somehow change the way the office is set up, that is, the way the office looks so that more people can work in that same space. We use the term “offic e space” to refer to the area where the offices are for a business.  

Fernando is supposed to accommodate several new emp loyees. “To accommodate” (accommodate) means, in this case, to make room for, to make space for. I have to accommodate some new people in  my company. I have to find a place for them. I have to arrange things so that they are able to come and work here.  

“Employees” are, of course, workers, people who wor k for a company. Fernando asks his coworker, another person who works at the company, by the name of Petra, to get her advice. Fernando says, “I was thi nking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices.” Fernando  wants to divide up the office. “To divide up” means to take something and make it into smaller pieces. It really means the same here as “to divide.” “I’m going to d ivide this into four pieces.” You could say that. Or you could say “I'm going to divide this up into four pieces.” “Up” is just used for emphasis.  

Fernando wants to take two large offices and divide  them up, or split them in half so that you have four smaller offices. Each office would be divided into two, in other words. He asked Petra what she thinks about t hat idea. Petra says, “Well, it seems to me” – in my opinion – “doing that would on ly solve part of the problem.” “To solve a problem” is to find the answer to some question or some difficulty that you have. In this case, the problem is accommodatin g new employees. 

Petra says, “Have you considered” – have you though t about – “converting the conference room into offices?” “To convert” means t o change something from  

one use to another use. Petra is recommending conve rting, or changing, the conference room into offices. The conference room i s a large room in an office building where you have meetings of five, ten, mayb e 20 people, depending on how big the room is.  

Fernando says, “I'm not sure that will work.” “Work ” here means – will be a successful solution to the problem. “The reason why ,” Fernando says, “is that we don't have another meeting space if we do that.” A “meeting space” is just a place where you would have a meeting. If they take the conference room and convert it into offices, then they won't have a pla ce for their meetings.  

Fernando says, “What are your thoughts on turning t he coffee room into one large office with cubicles?” “What are your thought s on” is a way of asking someone for their opinion. That, of course, is what  this whole dialog is about – expressions that we use in giving and asking for su ggestions in a work environment. This is a very common expression – “Wh at are your thoughts on?” “What are your thoughts on?” means what is your opi nion about something.  

In this case, Fernando wants to know Petra’s opinio n, or her thoughts, on turning or converting the coffee room into one large office . The “coffee room,” which may also be called the “break room,” is a place where e mployees can go on their break or during their lunchtime. If it's a big room , they can sit down and eat their lunch there if they brought their lunch to work.  

What Fernando is suggesting is that they convert th e coffee room into one large office with “cubicles.” “Cubicles” (cubicles) are l ike small offices, but the walls are not as high as a normal wall. The wall of the cubic le doesn't go all the way up to the top of the room, to the ceiling. “Cubicles” are  usually made by taking a big room and using these small portable walls – walls t hat can be moved back and forth – in order to make a square space for someone  to sit and work in.  

Petra says, “In my opinion, that's not going to be a very popular solution.” “In my opinion” – once again, she's giving her ideas – “th at's not going to be a very popular solution.” People aren't going to like that  solution. Fernando responds by using another expression that is common in giving y our opinion about something. He says, “The way I see it.” “The way I see it” mea ns here is my opinion. Here's the way I view this situation. Fernando says, “Ther e are no easy solutions.” There are no answers that are going to be easy, tha t aren’t going to cause some other problems.  

“That may be the best one,” Fernando says, meaning his solution may be the best one. “Do you have any other suggestions?” This  is a question that you use  

to ask someone for additional ideas. “Do you have a ny other suggestions (or recommendations)?”  

Petra says, “No, none that would really work” – non e that would be successful. “In my opinion, the only solution is to divide up t he executive offices.” “In my opinion,” again, is a phrase we could use when we a re going to give our own ideas about a situation. “The only solution,” Petra  says, “is to divide up the executive offices.” “Executive offices” are offices  for the leaders of the company: the president, the vice president, and so forth.  

Petra says, “But I know, I know. That's not going t o happen.” She says, “I know, I know,” meaning she understands that that solution w on't work. She says, “That's not going to happen. My suggestion is to ask a few more of the old employees.” Petra is telling Fernando to get the opinion of oth er employees who have been at the company for a long time.  

“Maybe they'll think of something.” “To think of so mething” means to have an idea, a solution to a problem. Fernando says, “I th ink you're right. It's not going to be an easy decision and I can use all the help I ca n get.” That last expression, “I can use all the help I can get,” means I'm going to  need a lot of help. There can't be too much help. The more I get, the better my sit uation will be. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
