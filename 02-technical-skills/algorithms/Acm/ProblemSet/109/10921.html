<p>
In some places is common to remember a phone number associating its digits to letters.
In this way the expression <b>MY LOVE</b> means <b>69 5683</b>. Of course there are some
problems, because some phone numbers can not form a word or a phrase and the digits
<b>1</b> and <b>0</b> are not associated to any letter.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to read an expression and find the corresponding phone number based on
the table below. An expression is composed by the capital letters (<b>A-Z</b>), 
hyphens (<b>-</b>) and the numbers <b>1</b> and <b>0</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td>Letters</td><td>Number</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ABC</td><td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>DEF</td><td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>GHI</td><td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>JKL</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>MNO</td><td>6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PQRS</td><td>7</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>TUV</td><td>8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>WXYZ</td><td>9</td>
	</tr>
