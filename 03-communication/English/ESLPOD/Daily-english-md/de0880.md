[start of dialog]

Norma:  What is this?

Jimmy:  It’s a flyer for a meeting I’ve called to t alk about forming a labor union here.

Norma:  Here?  Do you think the management will let  us?

Jimmy:  They can’t stop us.  We’re working longer a nd longer hours and we need to demand higher pay.  We also need better work con ditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.  All of us need to band toge ther to have better bargaining power.

Norma:  I don’t know.  I want to be better paid and  to have job security like everybody else, but I’m afraid of what will happen when we start agitating.

Jimmy:  I’ll tell you what will happen: The managem ent will finally hear what we have to say.  With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we deserve, at long last.  Are you in or out?

Norma:  I’ll have to think about it.

Jimmy:  He who hesitates is lost.

Norma:  Yes, but I was always taught to look before  I leap.

 Our dialog begins with Norma asking Jimmy, “What is  this?” Jimmy says “It's a flyer for a meeting.” A “flyer” (flyer) here means a piece of paper that has some text on it, some words on it, perhaps also some ima ges on it. Usually a flyer is one side of a piece of paper that contains informat ion about a meeting or some event that you want people to know about, and perha ps to come to.

Jimmy says “It's a flyer for a meeting I’ve called”  – meaning I have decided to organize – “to talk about forming a labor union her e.” A “labor (labor) union” is an organization of workers, of employees, who get toge ther and decide that they are going to negotiate with their employer, the company  that pays their salaries, together as one big group. The idea here of course,  is that they will have more power, more ability to get what they want in terms of pay and working conditions and so forth. Labor unions have been around for man y years. In the United States, they are not as popular as they are in some  other countries. They are not as popular now as they were even 40, 50 years ago h ere in the United States.

Norma says “Here? Do you think the management will let us?” “The management” refers to the directors of the company,  the bosses, the people who make the decisions, people who would not be conside red part of the union. The union, in this case, would be for the workers who d on't make as much money perhaps, and don't have the same power as the manag ement has. Norma is asking if Jimmy thinks the management will “let us. ” That is, will allow us, will permit us to do this.

Jimmy says “They can't stop us.” “To stop someone” means to prevent them from doing something. Jimmy says “They can't stop us,” t hey cannot stop us. “We’re working longer and longer hours” – longer hours are  more hours – “and we need to demand higher pay.” “To demand something” is to ask for it but in a very forceful way, to insist on it. “You must give me mo re money.” That's a demand. The demand here is for higher pay. “Pay” is the money that you get in your salary, you get from your employer, for the work yo u do. “Higher pay” would be more money.

We all, of course, want higher pay. I want higher p ay. In fact, if I don't get paid more, Center for Educational Development, I'm leavi ng this job. Forget it! I’m out of here. Oh, wait a minute. I actually need this jo b. So, let's continue.

Jimmy continues by saying “We also need better work  conditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.” “Work conditions” re fers to the environment or the situation where you work - is it a safe place to wo rk, for example. Jimmy says the employees need better work conditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.

“To have a say (say) in something” means to have an  influence on something, an influence in making a decision. Your children don't  have a say in where you're going to eat for dinner tonight. You just say “Chil dren, we’re going to go to this restaurant and you don't have a say in it.” You don 't get to decide – at least, that is the way it was in my family when we went to a re staurant, which wasn't very often.

Jimmy says that the employees should have a say in hiring and firing procedures. “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job. “To fire” (fire) here means to cause someone to lose their job. You're sa ying, “You can no longer work here.” You get rid of an employee. That's “to fire.” So Jimmy wants the employees to have a say in hiring and firing proced ures. “Procedures” are the rules or the steps that you follow to do something.  Jimmy goes on to say, “All of us need to band together to have better bargaining power.” “To band (band) together” means to work together. “Bargaining power ” is how much power, how much strength, if you will, you have in negotiating  with someone else. If you have a bunch of employees, a lot of employees, who get t ogether and say, “We’re not going to work anymore until you give us more money, ” the company may not have a lot of options. They may need you to work ri ght away or they'll lose a lot of money. So they say, “Okay, all right. We'll give yo u more money. We’ll give you a higher salary.” That would be an example of “bargai ning power.” The employees, by banding together, have more bargaining power, mo re negotiating power.

Norma says “I don't know. I want to be better paid and to have job security like everybody else but I'm afraid of what will happen w hen we start agitating.” “Job security” is knowing that you are going to have a j ob next week, that you're not going to be fired. Nowadays, it's very difficult to  get a lot of job security in many companies. Job security is something Norma wants bu t she's afraid of what will happen when we – that is, Jimmy, Norma and the othe r employees – start agitating. “To agitate” (agitate) means to start ca using problems or to start arguing for what you want, to start protesting, to let people know that you want some sort of change in society or in this particula r situation.

Jimmy says, “I'll tell you what will happen. The ma nagement will finally hear what we have to say.” The management will hear our messa ge. “With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we dese rve, at long last.” “Collective bargaining” is the situation I mentioned earlier, w here everyone gets together and you negotiate with the employer as a group. The bos s doesn't talk to one person and then another person and then another person and  negotiate or come to an agreement on their salary individually. The boss ha s to negotiate with the entire group, as one unit, if you will. That's collective bargaining.

“Collective” is an adjective meaning altogether as a group. “The rank (rank) and file (file)” refers to the ordinary employees or or dinary members of an organization, not the leaders, not the people in ch arge, not the management, in this case. “At long last” means finally after a lon g period of waiting. Jimmy is saying that with collective bargaining the rank and  file “will get what we deserve, at long last.” Then he asks Norma, “Are you in or o ut?” That expression, “in or out,” is used to ask someone whether they're going to participate or not. “Are you going to join us or not?” Norma says, “I'll have to  think about it.”

Jimmy uses an old expression in response. He says, “He who hesitates is lost.” “To hesitate” means to wait before making a decisio n, to go, “Oh, well, I'm not sure,” and you think about it for a while before yo u decide yes or no. “To be lost” means that you will lose the opportunity, that if y ou wait too long, the idea is, you won't be able to take advantage of the opportunity.  So, if you're at a party and you see a beautiful girl in the room and you are th inking about going over and talking to her, if you hesitate too long, if you wa it too long, some other gentlemen will walk up and talk to her and you will lose the opportunity. “He who hesitates is lost.”

Norma says, “Yes, but I was always taught to look b efore I leap.” Norma responds with another old saying, “to look before y ou leap” (leap). “To leap” means to jump, especially if you're jumping off a h igh place onto a lower place. “To look before you leap” means to make sure you kn ow where you're going. If you jump off of a very high place, you could hurt y ourself. So, you need to look before you leap to make sure it's a good decision. This is sort of the opposite of the other expression, “He who hesitates is lost.” “ To look before you leap” means to consider something carefully, to consider your d ecisions carefully before making them.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a normal speed.
