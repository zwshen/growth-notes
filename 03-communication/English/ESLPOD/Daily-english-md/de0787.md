This episode is all about the kind of words you wou ld use when talking to a baby or a small child, something a mother, a father, or perhaps a babysitter – someone watching a young child – might say.  Let’s get started.

My sister had to go out of town for a couple of day s and I offered to look after her 18-month-old twins.  It wasn’t long before I realiz ed that I was over my head! …

Colleen:  Okay, you two, it’s time to go beddy-bye.

Baby:  No!

Colleen:  Yes, let’s get your jammies on.  You can keep your binkie for now. Your blankie is already in your bed and it’s time t o go night-night.

Baby:  Potty!

Colleen:  Okay, once you have your jammies on, we’l l go potty.  What’s the matter, Mark?

Baby:  Owie!

Colleen:  You have an owie?  Where?  In your tummy?   Oh, you have a boo-boo on your finger.  No, don’t stick your wet finger in  your brother’s ear.  That’s icky. Wait one teensy-weensy minute and I’ll put a band-a id on it.

Baby:  Whee!

Colleen:  Michael, you can’t jump off the chair lik e that.  That’s a no-no.  Oopsie- daisy!

Baby:  Waaaaa! …

Michael had learned his lesson and so had I!

Our story begins with Colleen saying that her siste r had to go out of town for a couple of days and I offered to look after her 18-m onth-old twins.  “To look after (someone)” means to take care of someone: “I’m goin g to look after my nephew, who’s five years old,” or, “I’m going to look after  my neighbor’s dog while he is on vacation.”  Neither of those things I would actuall y do however, just an example! Well in the story, Colleen offers to look after her  18-month-old twins – well, her sister’s 18-month-old twins.  “Twins” are two child ren who are born at the same time from the same mother – well obviously, one usu ally comes out of the mother before the other.  I have twins in my family; I hav e older brothers who are twins. My sister has two children who are also twins.  In the story, we have two twins who are 18 months old, a year and a half.  Colleen says, “It wasn’t long before I realized that I was over my head!”  We might more c ommonly say, “I was in over my head.”  “To be over your head” means to be in a situation that is too difficult for you, that you are not able to manage or handle.

Colleen says to the babies, “Okay, you two (you two  babies), it’s time to go beddy-bye.”  “Beddy-bye” comes from the word “bed” (bed) and “goodbye.” “Beddy-bye” (beddy-bye) is an expression you use wi th young children to talk about going to bed and falling asleep.  You may say , “Well, let’s go beddy-bye,” or, “It’s time for you to go beddy-bye,” meaning yo u have to leave now and go to your room and fall asleep; at least that’s the plan .

The baby says, “No!”  Colleen says okay, “let’s get  your jammies on.”  “Jammies” (jammies) is a word you use with young children to describe pajamas.  “Pajamas” are the clothing that you put on to go to bed, if y ou wear clothing to bed.  If you don’t, I don’t need to know that!  Colleen says, “You can keep your binkie for now.”  A “binkie” (binkie) is, again, a word you wo uld only use with a young child, a baby.  It means a “pacifier,” which is a small pi ece of usually plastic that you put in the baby’s mouth so that they shut up – I me an, so that they don’t cry.  The baby sucks on the pacifier, and it’s called a “bink ie.”  Why a “binkie”?  I don’t know.  I tried to take care of my niece once, when she was, oh, maybe a year

and a half old, just like the example here.  It was  a total disaster.  I never offered to babysit – to look after my brother’s children ag ain.  That was 1978, by the way.

Well, back to our story.  Colleen tells the babies,  “Your blankie is already in your bed and it’s time to go night-night.”  “Blankie” (b lankie) is again a word, like most of these words, you would only use with a small chi ld or a baby.  “Blankie” is a “blanket,” something you put on you to keep yoursel f warm in a bed.  “Night- night” is like “beddy-bye,” it’s a word you say to children when they’re going to bed and falling asleep.  You might also say it just  to mean “good night.”  “Night- night” would mean “good night” to young child.

The baby, however, has other ideas, as babies often  do.  One of the babies says, “Potty!”  “Potty” (potty) is a baby word for bathro om or toilet.  You might say to a young child, say under the age of four, “Do you hav e to go potty?”  “Do you have to go to the potty?”  Either one would be correct.  You’re asking them if they need to use the bathroom – for those who are old enough,  of course, to use the bathroom.  So the baby says, “Potty,” meaning that he or she – he, in this case – wants to go to the bathroom.  Colleen says, “Okay, once you have your jammies on, we’ll go potty,” meaning we’ll go to the bathro om – take you to the bathroom.

Then, she says, “What’s the matter, Mark?”  Mark is  the name of one of the babies; it’s also the name of one of my brothers, w ho is a twin.  The baby says, “Owie!”  “Owie,” which I guess we would spell (owie ), is a word that children use to talk about some injury, when they hurt themselve s, if something hurts.  A parent might also use it with a child: “Do you have  an owie?”  Do you have something that hurts, usually if you cut yourself o r hit yourself.  Colleen says, “You have an owie?  Where?  In your tummy?”  “Tummy ” (tummy) is a baby word for stomach.  Colleen says, “Oh, you have a boo-boo  on your finger.”  A “boo- boo” (boo-boo) is a baby word similar to “owie,” wh en you cut yourself or hit yourself or hurt yourself somewhere.

Colleen says, “Now, don’t stick your wet finger in your brother’s ear.  That’s icky.” Something that is “icky” (icky) is unpleasant, it’s  unattractive, we might say it’s “gross.”  It’s, again, a word used with children.  Colleen says, “Wait one teensy- weensy minute and I’ll put a band-aid on it.”  “Tee nsy-weensy” is a baby word to used to describe something that is very small.  Ano ther similar expression is “itsy-bitsy,” but “teensy-weensy” is perhaps a litt le more common I guess, I don’t know.  I don’t talk to babies very often.  But, Col leen uses “teensy-weensy,” a “teensy-weensy minute,” meaning a very short amount  of time, and she’ll put a band-aid on the baby’s boo-boo.  A “band-aid” is a small, sticky piece of plastic, or some other material, that you put over a cut.  W hen a child or an adult cuts themselves, when they have a cut in the skin that m ay be bleeding – blood is

coming out of it – you would put a band-aid on it –  a bandage.  I think Band-Aid is like Kleenex, what we call a “brand name,” it’s act ually the name of a company; the technical word, or the common word would be a “ bandage.”  But it’s quite common for people just to call it a “band-aid,” the  way in some countries they use the word “hoover” to talk about a vacuum cleaner, i n British English I believe.

The baby says, “Whee!”  “Whee” would be when a baby  is happy they may say something like that.  Colleen says, “Michael” – who  is the other young baby, and also my brother; his name is Michael, also a twin –  says, “Michael, you can’t jump off the chair like that.  That’s a no-no.”  A “no-no” is a word we use, again with children, for something that is not allowed, s omething that is not permitted, something they cannot do.  Colleen says then, “Oops ie-daisy!”  “Oopsie-daisy” is a phrase used with children when they’ve made a mis take, when something didn’t go as you planned it to go.  In English with  adults we would probably just say something like “oops” (oops) – “oops” when you make a mistake.  Some adults may use other words when they make a mistake , as well!

The baby then, who just jumped off the chair – Mich ael just jumped off the chair, and he starts to cry: “Waaaaa!”  “Michael,” Colleen  says, “had learned his lesson and so had I!”  “To learn your lesson” means to lea rn from a difficult situation, maybe a painful situation.  When you do something w rong, you realize your mistake, and we hope you learn your lesson, meaning  you won’t do it again. Michael had learned his lesson, and Colleen says sh e had learned her lesson, too, which is not to babysit her 18-month-old nephe ws!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
