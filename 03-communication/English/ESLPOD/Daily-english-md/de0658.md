This episode is a dialogue between Omar and Adelia about judging a “contest,” or a competition.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Adelia:  When I created this writing contest, I had  no idea that we would get so many entries.   

Omar:  Good thing you have an impartial panel of ju dges to help you select the winner. 

Adelia:  Yes, good thing.  I’m really grateful to a ll of you for giving up your time to help.   

Omar:  What criteria are we using to score each of the entries?   

Adelia:  We’re using a 10-point scale.  Each of us will read an entry and give it a score.  When we’re all done, we’ll average out thos e scores.  Hopefully, there’ll be a clear winner. 

Omar:  And if not? 

Adelia:  If there isn’t, then we’ll take the top sc orers and vote on which is best. Majority rules. 

Omar:  Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifyin g an entry?  For instance, what if somebody didn’t follow the entry guidelines ? 

Adelia:  I’ve already culled the entries for the on es that don’t meet the requirements.  These are all eligible. 

Omar:  Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our work  cut out for us. 

Adelia:  You’ve got that right.

Adelia begins by saying to Omar, “When I created th is writing contest, I had no idea that we would get so many entries.”  A “contes t,” as you probably know, is a competition where you have different people trying to become the winner – to get the top place.  This word can be used in a number o f different ways, some of which are found your Learning Guide for this episod e.  An “entry” (entry) is something that you prepare and then give to someone  to be part of a contest; it’s part of the competition.  It can also be called a “ submission,” when you give something – “submit” something to someone. 

Adelia says that she had no idea, meaning she didn’ t know; she was surprised that they got so many entries.  This is, of course,  people writing something for this writing contest.  Omar said, “Good thing you h ave an impartial panel of judges to help you select the winner.”  “Good thing ” is short for “it is a good thing (that you have an impartial panel of judges).”  “To  be impartial” (impartial) means to be fair, to be objective, not to favor this pers on over that person.  The opposite of “impartial” is “partial.”  “I am partial to her and not to him.”  You want a “judge,” someone making the decision about who is best, to b e impartial, to be fair.  A “panel of judges” is a group of people who decide h ow good something is, and then decide who is the best person. 

Adelia says, “Yes, good thing (meaning yes, it is a  good thing).  I’m really grateful to all of you for giving up your time to help.”  Sh e’s thanking the panel of judges. Omar says, “What criteria are we using to score eac h of the entries?”  “Criteria” is the plural of “criterion” (criterion).  “Criterion”  is a factor; it is one quality or characteristic that you use to judge the quality of  something.  “Criteria” (ending in “ia”) is the plural and it refers to the qualities or characteristics that you use to judge something.  So for example, your professor at  the university might have different criteria for getting an A, a high score i n his or her class.  It might include coming to class every week, writing a paper, doing well on the exam, and so forth.  “Score,” here, is used as a verb, “to score ,” which in this context means to assign a number or letter to something to evaluate the quality of it.  If you watch the Olympics you know that they give scores for the  performances.  In  

gymnastics, for example, you could get a 8.5 or a 9 .6.  These are scores; the judges are scoring each of the contestants – each o f the athletes.   

Adelia says, “We’re using a 10-point scale.”  A “sc ale” is a range of numbers – of values that can be assigned to evaluate the quality  of something.  So for example, your teacher might judge you on a five-poi nt scale.  Five is excellent; four is, hmm, very good; three is not great; two is  poor; and one is very poor. That would be a scale.  This is a 10-point scale, 1 0 being the highest and 1 being the lowest, or 0.  Adelia says, “Each of us will re ad an entry (read one of the essays, whatever was written), and give it a score.   When we’re all done, we’ll average out each of these scores.”  “To average out ” means to add a group of numbers and then divide by the number of items in t he group.  So, if I give someone an 8 and you give them a 9 and the third ju dge gives them a 10, you can add those up and get 27, you divide that by 3 b ecause there are 3 judges, and that gives you the average score of 9.  That’s how you average out the scores.  You could hear – just say “to average the scores,” but we tend to prepositions and other words to verbs in order to m ake it more difficult for other people to learn English!  “Hopefully,” Adelia says,  “there’ll be a clear winner.”  A “clear” winner is someone who obviously won, it was n’t even close; this person got the highest score and it was much higher than a nyone else.  That would be a clear winner. 

Adelia hopes they’ll have a clear winner, but Omar says, “And if not?” meaning if there isn’t a clear winner.  Adelia says, “If there  isn’t, then we’ll take the top scorers (the people who got the highest scores) and  vote on which is best.”  “To vote on” means everyone says who they think should be the winner, and the person with the most votes wins.  Adelia says, “Maj ority rules.”  “Majority rules” means that anyone who gets 50 percent plus 1 wins t he contest.  Omar says, “Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifying an e ntry?”  “To disqualify” is to determine that this person cannot participate in th e contest because they perhaps did something wrong; they didn’t follow the  rules.  There’s some reason why they didn’t meet the requirements we might say,  they would be disqualified. If you use certain drugs in…I don’t know…bowling – because you know those bowlers are all taking drugs, right? – then you may  be disqualified if you’re taking, like, steroids or something.  That’s to dis qualify.   

Omar says, “For instance, what if somebody didn’t f ollow the entry guidelines?” The “guidelines” are the rules, the instructions.  Adelia says, “I’ve already culled the entries,” meaning I’ve already looked through t hem and got rid of the weak ones or the ones that don’t qualify.  “I’ve already  culled (culled) the entries for the ones that don’t meet the requirements (that are dis qualified).  These (the ones that she has) are all eligible.”  “To be eligible” means that you have met the  

minimum requirements; you followed the rules; you a re able to participate in something.  There’s an old expression, “an eligible  bachelor.”  A “bachelor” is an unmarried man.  “To be eligible” means that he is a vailable to be someone you could marry; someone who doesn’t have any other rom antic relationships for example. 

Omar says, “Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our  work cut out for us.”  This expression, “to have your work cut out for you,” me ans that you have a lot of work; you have many things you have to do, it’s a b ig project.  Some girlfriends try to change their boyfriends, try to change the w ay they look, dress, act, and so forth.  We could say they have their work cut out f or them; that’s a very long job! Adelia says, “You’ve got that right.”  The expressi on here, said with that particular pronunciation – that intonation, “you got that righ t” – is used to show you agree with someone completely.  You fully agree with that  person, and that’s what Adelia is saying to Omar. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
