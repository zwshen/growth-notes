# Getting Revenge

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 237: Getting Revenge.  You're listening to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 237.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in, you know where, Los Angeles, California - beautiful Los Angeles, California.    Remember to visit our website, as we often remind you, at eslpod.com.  You can find there the Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions not found in the podcast, cultural notes and the complete transcript of this episode.  Our podcast today, “Getting Revenge,” is actually related to an earlier podcast that we did, ESL Podcast number 233, which was called “Asking for a Date.”  So, you might want to listen to that, or at least look at the dialogue on our website before you listen to this, but you can understand it without having listened to 233.  Now let's get started.  [Start of story]  Jaime:  I don’t know what’s wrong with Liam lately.  The guy is short-tempered and jumps down my throat about every little thing.    Debra:  [laughs]  Jaime:  What’s so funny?  Debra:  I have a feeling that he’s not getting enough sleep.  Jaime:  You don’t mean you and Liam...  Debra:  No way!  It’s just that the women in this office are paying him back for the way he's treated them, two-timing them and leading them on.  Jaime:  Are you serious?    Debra:  Yeah, there are quite a few women with an axe to grind and wouldn’t mind getting even with him.  You’re not going to tell him, are you?
