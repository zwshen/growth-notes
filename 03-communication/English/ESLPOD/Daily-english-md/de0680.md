[start of dialogue]

Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I kno w the real reason for the success of this project.

Issac:  What?

Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.

Issac:  That’s nonsense.

Fumi:  No, it’s not.  I know you don’t like the lim elight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.  Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.

Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit.  I do n’t want to hear another word about it.

Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most un sung heroes like to keep a low profile.

Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!

Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And s oon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!

Issac:  What are you proposing to do?

 Fumi:  Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker-tape  parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are arou nd here!

Our dialogue begins with Fumi saying to Issac, “You  may have everyone else fooled, but I know the real reason for the success of this project.”  “To fool (fool) (someone)” means to trick them, to deceive them, to  make them believe something that isn’t true, that is false.  Fumi say s to Issac that he has been fooling – he has been lying, in some ways, to every one, but she knows the real reason why this project has been a success, whateve r project they’re working on. Issac says, “What?”  Fumi says, “You,” meaning you’ re the real reason for the success of this project.  She says, “You’ve been wo rking behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.”  the expression “to work behind the scenes” (scenes) means to do something that is necessary for a project to succeed but is not noticed by most people.  The oth er people involved don’t realize that you are doing this work; you’re doing it in secret in some ways.  A “scene” here refers, for example, to a play in a th eater, where you have what are basically big paintings that give you the impressio n that you are in a different place.  Those are called the “scenery,” and so “to work behind the scenes” is to be, if you will, part of the play but no one actual ly sees you.  That was me, by the way, in my high school play; I was in my high schoo l play.  In American high schools typically there’s at least one play or musi cal every year.  I was in mine, but I was on the lighting crew – so I turned the li ghts on and off!  So I was in the play, but I was working behind the scenes you see.  Not many people know that.

Anyway, Fumi says that Issac has been working behin d the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  “To bolster” (b olster) means to make someone feel stronger and more confident, or simply  to improve something.  The expression “to be up to the task” means to be ready  and prepared to do something, to have the abilities or the qualificati ons to perform a certain job or task.  So, Fumi says that Issac was basically helpi ng other people in the project who were not doing their job or who were not capabl e – able to do their job.  She says, “Without you, this project would have been su nk months ago.”  “To be sunk” (sunk) literally means to be underwater, like  a ship.  If you sink a ship – “sunk” is the past of “sink” – then the ship, or bo at, is underwater.  “To be sunk,” then, is a general expression that means to fail, n ot to be successful.

Issac says, “That’s nonsense,” saying that what Fum i is telling him is wrong. Fumi says, “No, it’s not.”  She says, “I know you d on’t like the limelight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.”  The “limelig ht” (limelight – one word) is used

to indicate that you are getting a lot of attention , that everyone is looking at you and paying attention to you including, for example,  those in media: the television and newspaper people, and Internet bloggers, and wh atever.  Everyone is paying attention to you; you are in the limelight.  But, I ssac doesn’t like the limelight. Fumi says he was the linchpin of this operation.  A  “linchpin” (linchpin – one word) is the most important person or thing in a gr oup; it’s the person or thing that everyone else depends on for success.  Fumi sa ys, “Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces.”  The expression “to have eg g (egg) on your face” means that you would be embarrassed publicly, you would b e in a position where you would look stupid or foolish and everyone would kno w about it.  But Issac says, “You’re giving me way too much credit.”  “To give ( someone) too much credit” means to say that they did more than they actually have done.  That is, you are saying that they are wonderful, you are saying how great they’ve been, but they don’t really deserve that much praise – that much c redit.  The use of the word “way” here, as in “way too much credit,” is just an other way of saying too much credit – too, too much credit we might say, but we don’t say that in English.  It’s like it’s really too much credit.  “Way” has been u sed this way for a long time, but it has become more popular in conversational Englis h.  For example, you might say to your friend, “Do I have too much makeup on m y face?” and your friend says, “Way too much,” meaning you really have too m uch, yes.  My friends tell me that all the time!

So Issac says, “I don’t want to hear another word a bout it (I don’t want you to say anything else to me about what you think I have don e).”  Fumi says, “I’m not surprised at your reaction (the way that you reacte d to what I said).”  Most unsung heroes like to keep a low profile.”  An “uns ung hero” is a person who makes an important contribution to a successful pro ject but who is not recognized for what they do.  Someone who does some thing great but nobody hears about it, nobody knows about it, that would b e an unsung hero.  “To keep a low profile” means to do something in a way that ot her people will not notice.  It’s another way of saying that other people are not pay ing attention to you.  The opposite would be “to keep a high profile,” which m eans everyone knows what you’re doing; everyone knows where you are, for exa mple.  Issac says, “What?! I’m nothing of the kind!”  “To be nothing of the ki nd” means that you are not an example of what the other person was just talking a bout.  It’s a phrase that we use to deny, to say no, to disagree with something.   Fumi says that Issac is an unsung hero, and he says, “I’m nothing of the kind (no, I’m not).”  Fumi says, “Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.”  “To be far  too modest” means to be very humble, not wanting to talk about your own accompli shments.  Notice that “far” here has the same meaning – the same function as the word “way.”  We could have said, “you’re way too modest,” that’s a little  more informal; “far too modest”

is a little more formal.  Fumi says, “And soon, I w on’t be the only one who thinks so (who thinks that you are an unsung hero).”

Issac says, “What are you proposing to do?”  “To pr opose” means to suggest or to present an idea for what you think should be don e and how it should be done. Fumi says, “Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker -tape parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are arou nd here!”  A “ticker tape” is a long piece of paper, usually in a roll, that is use d in a ticker tape machine, which is like a teletype or telegraph machine.  It was a way of conveying messages electronically, over the radio, and it was a specia l machine that converted the radio signals into something that would then produc e either typing or some sort of printing that you would be able to send informat ion over a long distance.  They were very popular in the old days, many years ago, for those that were involved in the New York and other stock exchanges.  When yo u’re done with the ticker tape you can cut it up and use it as “confetti,” wh ich are small, little pieces of paper that you cut up and then you throw on someone  as a way of congratulating them.  And, in New York City, when someone did some thing wonderful, the tradition was to give that person or those people a  “ticker-tape parade,” meaning they would take the tape – the pieces paper – rip t hem up, and throw them from the tall buildings in New York City so they would c ome down on the heroes that were being honored, sort of like rain falling down but it is paper.  In general, it’s used to indicate that you are going to have a big c elebration.  Fumi tells Issac that she’s not planning a ticker-tape parade, “but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are around here!”  “To rec ognize” means to realize that they are important.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I kno w the real reason for the success of this project.

Issac:  What?

Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.

Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit.  I do n’t want to hear another word about it.

Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most un sung heroes like to keep a low profile.

Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!

Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And s oon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!

Issac:  What are you proposing to do?

Fumi:  Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker-tape  parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are arou nd here!

One of the unsung heroes here at ESL Podcast, worki ng behind the scenes, is our own Dr. Lucy Tse.  Although since I talk about her, she really isn’t unsung. I’m singing her praises, which is an expression tha t means to say good things about another person.
