# Following a Dress Code

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 693: Following a Dress Code.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 693.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We invite you – I invite you to go to our website a t eslpod.com.  There, you will find a Learning Guide for this episode, and your li fe will be better after that.

This episode is a dialogue between Tae and Nicole.  They’re going to be talking about a “dress code,” when certain organizations ha ve requirements for how you must dress.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tae:  What are you doing?  Why are you taking all o f my clothes out of my suitcase?  I just finished packing that.

Nicole:  You’ve packed all of the wrong things.  We ’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirts.

Tae:  I’m going on vacation and I don’t have to dre ss to impress.

Nicole:  You’ve never been on a cruise like this on e, but I have, and there’s a dress code.  You’ll need formal wear for some of the dinners.

Tae:  I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacation.

Nicole:  No, not a suit and tie.  There’ll be a dan ce the final night of the cruise that’s black tie, so you’ll need your tuxedo.  I’m bringing a few cocktail dresses myself.  Don’t worry.  You can go semi-formal the r est of the evenings.

Tae:  This is ridiculous.  I have to wear business attire 300 days out of the year and you’re making me dress up when I finally go on a vacation.

Nicole:  You don’t have to dress up the entire time .  You can go California casual during the day.  I’m just asking that you look pres entable a few hours each day. Is that so hard?

Tae:  I knew there was a catch when you booked this  vacation.  It’s less a vacation for me than a dress-up party for you!

Tae begins by saying to Nicole, “What are you doing ?  Why are you taking all of my clothes out of my suitcase?  I just finished pac king that.”  So, Tae and Nicole are going on a trip somewhere, and Tae has put all of his clothes into his “suitcase,” which is a big bag or container for you r clothing when you travel; it could also be called a piece of “luggage.”  He says , “I just finished packing that.” “To pack” (pack) means, in this case, to put things  into a bag or a suitcase so that you can take them with you when you travel.  “ Pack” has a couple of other meanings, as well.  Take a look at our Learning Gui de for this episode to get more information.

Nicole says, “You’ve packed all of the wrong things .  We’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirt s.”  A “cruise” is when you get on a big boat and you sleep on the boat – really, i t’s a ship – and you go with all these other people on the ship and you usually trav el for three or four days, maybe a week or two weeks.  Everyone has their own room, and it is for some people very enjoyable.  I have to say I have been o n a couple of short, three-day cruises from Los Angeles down to Ensenada, Mexico, and I didn’t like them very much.  I didn’t like the food; I didn’t like being on a big ship…eh, but some people love it.  And so, if you like that sort of thing, t hat’s great.  Not for me.  Anyway, Nicole says they’re going on a luxury cruise.  “Lux ury” usually means very expensive, something that’s very nice.  But Tae has  just packed shorts and t- shirts, so he doesn’t have anything very nice to we ar.

Tae said, “I’m going on vacation and I don’t have t o dress to impress.”  This is an expression: “to dress to impress” means to choose y our clothing so that other people will have a good opinion of you.  If you are  going to an interview for a job, you should dress to impress; you should want the ot her person to think that you are very professional, that you take this interview  seriously, and so forth, and by wearing the right clothing then you can impress the  other person.  “To impress” means to give a good opinion to someone else about you.

Nicole says, “You’ve never been on a cruise like th is one, but I have, and there’s a dress code.”  “Code” (code) is another name for a  rule or law; here, it refers to the rules that the ship has about how you dress.  I t’s called a “dress code.”  Many businesses have dress codes; you can’t come in with out a tie, women can’t wear miniskirts, men can’t wear miniskirts – I mean some  of them can be very difficult to follow!  My old school, where I went grade schoo l and high school, had a dress

code.  The boys all had to wear shirts and ties and  black pants and black shoes and black socks.  That was the dress code.  Well, t he ship for the luxury cruise has a dress code.  Nicole says that Tae will need f ormal wear for some of the dinners.  “Formal wear” (wear) is clothing that is used for very special occasions. A wedding, a funeral, an important party such as an  anniversary, these would be times for formal wear.  Also, some restaurants requ ire formal wear.

Tae says, “I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacati on.”  A “tie” is what a typically man puts on; it’s a long piece of fabric – of cloth  – that is in the front from your neck down to, say, your waist.  A “suit” refers to a jacket and pants that go together that are very formal looking.  The word “s uit” can be used both for a man and a woman, but “suit and tie” usually refers to w hat a man would wear.

Nicole says, “No, not a suit and tie.  There’ll be a dance the final night of the cruise that’s black tie.”  “Black tie” means that i t will be a very formal, a very fancy event, and the men will have to wear tuxedos.  A “t uxedo” (tuxedo) is a special type of suit that men wear for very formal occasion s such as a wedding, but only the men who are participating in the wedding; the g room and the best man, for example, typically would wear a tux or a tuxedo.  W e call it a “tux” (tux) for short. If you are going to the Academy Awards in Hollywood  to receive an Oscar for your latest movie, then you would wear, if you were  a man, a tuxedo.  I plan on wearing a tuxedo when I am given an award for my si nging at the Grammy Awards, they’re called here in the U.S.; I’m just w aiting for my invitation!

Nicole says, “I’m bringing a few cocktail dresses m yself.”  A “cocktail (cocktail) dress” is a short or long dress worn by women for a  special occasion.  A “cocktail” is actually another word for an alcoholi c drink, but a “cocktail dress” is a formal dress that a woman would wear.  Nicole says,  “Don’t worry.  You can go semi-formal rest of the evenings.”  “Semi” means ha lf or partly, so “semi-formal” means not completely formal but not completely the opposite, what we would call “casual.”  The opposite of “formal,” when we’re tal king about clothing, is “casual.”

Tae says, “This is ridiculous,” meaning this is sil ly, this is something very strange, something that people would laugh at.  He says, “I have to wear business attire 300 days out of the year and you’re making me dress  up when I finally go on vacation.”  “Business attire” is another term for b usiness clothing, the kind of clothes you would wear to your office or wherever y ou work.  “Attire” (attire) is just another word for clothing.  Tae is complaining  that he has to dress up most of the days of the year in order to go to work, and  now, when he’s going on vacation, he doesn’t want to dress up.  “To dress u p” is a two-word – everyone say it with me – phrasal verb that means to wear cl othing that is nicer than what

you normally wear, or what you would wear on the we ekend let’s say.  Tae doesn’t want to dress up for vacation.

Nicole says, “You don’t have to dress up the entire  (or the whole) time”, that is, not every day on the vacation.  “You can go Califor nia casual during the day.” “California casual” means that you wear clothing th at is not quite as nice as a suit and tie, but not jeans and t-shirts either; it’s so rt of semi-formal.  California has the reputation of being more relaxed in terms of ho w people dress.  If you go to Hawaii, people are really relaxed – the island of H awaii.  California, however, is more casual, less formal in terms of the way people  dress here, in part because the weather is hotter and so it doesn’t makes sense  to dress up as much.  At least that’s my opinion.  Nicole says, “I’m just as king that you look presentable a few hours each day.”  “To look presentable” means t o look nice, to look clean, so that other people can see you.  When I get up in the morning, I go outside of my house and I get my newspaper, which was delivered t o my house.  I try to look presentable; I try to have at least some clothes on  so that if one of my neighbors saw me I wouldn’t be too embarrassed.  That’s “to b e presentable,” to look nice, to have clean clothing, and so forth.

Tae says, “I knew there was a catch when you booked  this vacation.”  A “catch” (catch) here means a trick, something that is hidde n, something that you don’t know about but you only find out later.  It sounds great, but then when you find the real truth it isn’t so great.  So, a “catch” is  the thing that you didn’t know about that isn’t so wonderful, and Tae says that he knew there was a catch when Nicole booked, or made the reservations – the plans  for their vacation on this luxury cruise.  He says, “It’s less a vacation for me than a dress-up party for you!” He’s saying that it isn’t really a vacation; it’s a n opportunity for Nicole to dress up, to wear nice clothing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
