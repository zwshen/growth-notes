This episode is a dialogue between Melissa and Cona n about someone who is bothering one of them, someone who is making proble ms for one of them.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Melissa:  I hate that guy Reuben.  He’s always gett ing in my face. 

Conan:  Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tension be tween the two of you. 

Melissa:  Sexual tension?  Are you out of your mind ?  He does nothing but give me a hard time.   

Conan:  That’s because he’s trying to get your atte ntion.   

Melissa:  If he likes me, why doesn’t he try to get  my attention by showing off, like every other guy? 

Conan:  Maybe he’s trying to stand out among your m any admirers.   

Melissa:  Don’t be stupid.  I don’t have a lot of a dmirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable! 

Conan:  Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he’ll s top his antics. 

Melissa:  What kind of a bone? 

Conan:  Ask him to the movies Saturday night.  

 Melissa:  Me, ask him out?  You’re certifiable! 

Conan:  I’m telling you that if you ask him out, he ’ll stop pestering you.   

Melissa:  Putting aside the fact that I find him re pulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this place.   

Conan:  I don’t think so.  He’ll get what he wants and he’ll stop pestering you. 

Melissa:  What if it backfires and he bothers me ev en more? 

Conan:  Then you’ll get what you want – deep down! 

[end of dialogue] 

Melissa begins by saying, “I hate that guy Reuben,”  meaning I hate that guy named Reuben – Reuben is his name.  Reuben is also a kind of sandwich, but I don’t think she’s talking about a sandwich.  No, sh e’s talking about that guy, Reuben.  Melissa says, “He’s always getting in my f ace.”  “To get in (someone’s) face” means to bother them, to annoy them.  It coul d also mean to challenge them, to disagree with them in order to make them a ngry.  “He was getting in my face,” we might say more informally, “he was gettin g up all in my face,” it’s the same thing. 

Conan says, “Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tensi on between the two of you.” “To sense” (sense) means to perceive, to feel, to u nderstand.  “I sense there is something wrong here” means I think there is someth ing wrong, I don’t know for sure but from what I am seeing and hearing that’s, we might say, my impression – that’s my sense of what is going on.  Conan says that he senses some sexual tension.  “Sexual tension” would be when two people  are attracted to each other romantically, which in a strange way causes some un comfortable feelings between the two people.  The use of the word “serio us” here (serious) doesn’t mean serious in the sense of not funny or serious i n the sense of something that is very important.  Instead, it’s used here to mean  a lot; it’s a word used for emphasis.  You might think of it as meaning a lot o f. 

Melissa says, “Sexual tension?  Are you out of your  mind?”  “To be out of your mind” means to be crazy, to be irrational, not to b e thinking properly or correctly. Melissa says, “He (Reuben) does nothing but give me  a hard time.”  The construction “he does nothing but” really means the  only thing he does is to give me a hard time.  “To give (someone) a hard time” me ans to either make it difficult  

for that person to do something, or perhaps simply to make fun of that person. Here, it means the first meaning, to make difficult  for someone else.  Conan says, “That’s because he’s trying to get your atten tion.”  Conan says that Reuben is giving Melissa a hard time because he wants Meli ssa’s attention.  He wants Melissa to pay attention to him, to notice him, and  of course, ultimately, to like him.   

Melissa says, “If he likes me, why doesn’t he try t o get my attention by showing off, like every other guy?”  “To show off” means to  try to get attention from other people by showing or saying how good you are: “Oh, I have such a nice car. Have you seen my new car?  It’s really nice.”  That  would be showing off. Usually, showing off is something that you actually  do.  For example, “Did I tell you I can speak in Swahili, Italian, and Chinese?”  And then you start speaking in those languages; that would be showing off.  You’re  trying to impress other people.  This is something, of course, that men do with women to try to get their attention.  When they’re interested in a woman they  may try to show off, and that’s what Melissa means when she says why doesn’t  Reuben try to get my attention by showing off, like every other guy – li ke every other man.  So I could say to a woman, “You know, I’m a podcaster.”  And y eah, that – that’ll impress a lot of women.  Yes it will!  I don’t need to impres s women because I’m married, but if I weren’t I could tell a women, “Hey, heh, I ’m a podcaster.  Yeah.”  Yeah, that’s impressive.  I’m just kidding, of course! 

Conan says, “Maybe he’s trying to stand out among y our many admirers.” Conan is answering Melissa’s question about why Reu ben doesn’t show off like other guys.  He says that Reuben is trying to stand  out.  “To stand out” means to be different from the people around you, to be very  noticeable, to have other people pay attention to you and not pay attention t o the people around you. That’s to stand out.  “To stand” has several differ ent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  So, Conan thinks Reuben is trying to stand out among Melissa’s many admirers.  “To ad mire” (admire) means to like someone, to believe that person is a very good  person, to want to be like that person.  An “admirer,” with an “r” at the end, is s omeone who admires.  Often we use this term in a romantic sense, when a woman has  several men who are interested in her – who admire her.  We have anothe r expression: “a secret admirer.”  Somebody sends a woman a flower and they  don’t say what their name is.  They may say “your secret admirer,” someo ne who likes you but doesn’t want to give his name. 

Melissa says, however, “Don’t be stupid,” meaning t hat’s stupid.  You’re being unintelligent.  You’re saying things that don’t mak e any sense.  “Don’t be stupid” is definitely an insulting thing to say to someone.   Melissa says, “I don’t have a lot  

of admirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable!”  “Miserable” (miserable) means terrible, horrible.  Melissa does n’t want anyone who’s going to make her life terrible or miserable. 

Conan says, “Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he ’ll stop his antics.”  “To throw (someone) a bone” (bone) means to give someon e a little encouragement, or to give someone a little reward for something go od they have done.  The expression probably comes from giving the bones of the meat that you eat to your dog.  Dogs like bones, I guess.  So, “to throw  (somebody) a bone” means to give them a small reward, something like a little g ift.  Conan is suggesting that Melissa do something nice for Reuben, and then mayb e Reuben will stop his antics.  “Antics” (antics) are silly, strange, unus ual behavior.  We often associate this word with children who are acting or behaving strangely, often to get the attention of their parents. 

Melissa says, “What kind of a bone?” meaning how sh ould I reward him.  Conan says, “Ask him to the movies Saturday night,” ask h im to go to a movie with you. Melissa says, “Me, ask him out?”  “To ask someone o ut” means to ask them to go on a date.  Traditionally, the man asks the woma n to go on a date.  So Melissa can’t believe what Conan is suggesting.  In  fact, she says to Conan, “You’re certifiable!”  When you call someone “certi fiable” (certifiable) it here means crazy, insane, nuts.  Conan says, “I’m tellin g you that if you ask him out, he’ll stop pestering you.”  “To pester” (pester) me ans to bother or annoy someone.  If you say “stop pestering me,” you mean stop bothering me, stop annoying me.   

Melissa says, “Putting aside the fact that I find h im repulsive,” meaning if we don’t even consider the fact that I find this perso n repulsive – and “repulsive” (repulsive) means unattractive, very disgusting, so mething you don’t want even to be close to.  Melissa says, “Putting aside the f act I find him repulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this pl ace.”  Someone who is the “laughingstock” (one word) is someone that everyone  laughs at, that everyone makes fun of.   

Conan says, “I don’t think so.  He’ll get what he w ants and he’ll stop pestering you.”  Melissa asks, “What if it backfires and he b others me even more?”  For something “to backfire” (backfire – one word) is to  have the opposite results of what you expect.  So you tell your friend, “Oh, tha t’s a very good job you did,” and your friend gets angry at you; your friend yell s at you.  We would say that your compliment – the nice thing you said – backfir ed; somehow it had the opposite result that you wanted it or expected it t o have.  Melissa says what if me asking Reuben out on a date backfires; in other wor ds, instead of liking Melissa,  

Reuben will start bothering her and pestering her e ven more.  Conan says, “Then you’ll get what you want – deep down!”  The phrase “deep down” means related to your very secret, inner feelings, how you really  think about something but you don’t want to tell anyone else.  So what Conan is s aying here is that really Melissa likes the fact that Reuben bothers her.  So  when Melissa says well, what if he bothers me even more, Conan says well, then y ou’ll get what you really want, because that’s what you really want deep down .  He’s saying that Melissa is also attracted to or romantically interested in Reuben. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
