On this episode, we are going to listen to a dialog ue between Sonia and Nadir about parts of the body. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: What in the world is that?!

Nadir: It’s a life-size figure of George Washington . It’s for Leon’s school project.

Sonia: Then why are you making it?

Nadir: I’m not. I’m just helping him.

Sonia: Uh-huh. Why does George Washington have real ly big hands and flat palms?

Nadir: He cut down the family’s cherry tree. Rememb er? He probably needed big hands to do that.

Sonia: And why does he have little tiny feet with s ix toes on each foot and no ankles?

Nadir: I made a little mistake with those, but they ’ll be covered up with shoes, so no one will see them.

Sonia: And why is George’s head shaped like an egg?  His ears are lopsided and his earlobes are disproportionate to his other faci al features.

 Nadir: That’s why I made the forehead and chin bigg er, so no one will notice those ears. We’ll probably put a hat on him anyway.

Sonia: But his legs look really thin on top and thi ck on the bottom, with kneecaps that stick out.

Nadir: I’ll put pants on him, so no one will see th ose either.

Sonia: So it won’t matter if he’s not anatomically correct, right?

Nadir: Right.

Sonia: Good thing this isn’t for science class!

We begin our dialogue with Sonia asking Nadir a que stion. She says, “What in the world is that?” When someone uses that expressi on “in the world,” they are trying to give you the idea that they are shocked o r surprised about something. “What in the world are you doing?” you might say to  your child, for example, if he is doing something that you don’t want him to do, o r if you are simply puzzled. You don’t understand why someone is doing something  – you may say, “What in the world are you doing?” There’s an implication in  this question that you find what they are doing as strange or unusual.

Nadir responds, “It’s a life-size figure of George Washington. It’s for Leon’s school project.” When we say something is a “life-s ize figure” (and you might also hear people say “life-sized” with a “d” at the end,  “figure” – either one is correct) we mean that they have some sort of statue or objec t that is the same size as the person that the object represents. So, a “life-size  statue” or a “life-size figure” of George Washington would be something that looks lik e George Washington and is as big as George Washington was. You may know th at George Washington was the first president of United States.

Nadir for some reason has a life-size figure of Geo rge Washington. Why? He says it is “for Leon’s school project.” We’re guess ing that Leon is Nadir’s son. Sonia says, “Then why are you making it?” Why isn’t  Leon making it, since it’s for his school project or assignment. Nadir says, “I’m not. I’m just helping him.” Sonia doesn’t believe Nadir. She says, “Uh-huh.” Bu t she says it in such a way that we know she doesn’t really think that Nadir is  telling the truth.

She then asks, “Why does George Washington have rea lly big hands and flat palms?” Your “hand” (hand) is at the end of your ar m and is used for grabbing things and picking things up. “Palm” (palm) is the area of your hand which is between the bottom of the hand and the finger. So, between basically your wrist (which is the part of the body that connects the ar m to the hand) and the fingers of your hand – that flat area on the front of your hand is called your “palm.”

Sonia wants to know why George Washington has “real ly big hands and flat palms.” “Flat” means there aren’t any bumps in it. It’s completely straight, if you will. Nadir says, “He cut down the family’s cherry tree, remember? He probably needed big hands to do that.” Nadir refers to an ol d story about George Washington, who, when he was a boy, apparently cut down a tree, a cherry tree.

The story is that when his father asked him if he c ut down the tree, George was honest. He admitted, “Yes. I cut down that cherry t ree.” This story was meant to demonstrate the honesty of George Washington, how h e was a good man. Nadir thinks that since Washington cut down a tree, he mu st’ve had really big hands. It makes sense, I think.

Sonia then says, “Why does he have little tiny feet  with six toes on each foot and no ankles?” Sonia says that this life-size figure o f George Washington has “tiny” feet, meaning very small feet. Your “feet,” of cour se, are the things that you walk on. The figure also has six toes. Your “toes” (toes ) are the “digits,” we might call them, that are at the ends of your feet. They’re so rt of like your fingers, but they’re on your feet. We call those “toes.” There a re normally five toes on each feet, just as there are five fingers on each hand. However, this figure of George Washington has six toes, and it doesn’t have any an kles.

Your “ankle” (ankle) is the part that connects your  leg to your foot, just as your “wrist” (wrist) connects your arm to your hand. Nad ir says, “I made a little mistake” – a small mistake – “but they’ll be covere d up with shoes, so no one will see them.” Sonia then asks, “And why is George’s he ad shaped like an egg?” Your “head” is the part of your body that contains your brain (or, in the case of my neighbor, no brain), your eyes, your nose, your ears, and so forth. And your hair, if you have hair. Sonia is asking why George Washington’s head is “shaped like,” or in the form of, “an egg.”

The ears, Sonia says, “are lopsided and the earlobe s are disproportionate to his other facial features.” Your “ears” (ears) are the things that you hear out of. When we say something is “lopsided” (lopsided) we mean i t is uneven. One side is longer than the other, in this case. “Earlobes” (ea rlobes) are the bottom parts of your ears, the part that is below the ear opening w here you have the sound go

into your ear. Below that part, there is a small pi ece of flesh that we call the “earlobe.” It’s where you would put earrings, for e xample, if you have earrings.

I don’t have any earrings myself. Maybe I should. M aybe I should get earrings. What do you think? Well, back to our story here.

The earlobes, according to Sonia, on George Washing ton’s figure are “disproportionate to his other facial features.” Wh en we say something is “disproportionate” (disproportionate), we mean that  they look too big or too small compared to the other things, in this case, on the figure. When something is “disproportionate,” it is bigger than it should be.  For example, if you draw someone’s face and you make the nose five times big ger than the eyes, we would say the nose is disproportionate to the eyes – it’s too big compared to the size of the eyes. “Dis” (dis) here means “not.” So,  “disproportionate” means not proportionate.

The earlobes, then, are not the right size compared  to the other facial features. “Facial (facial) features” are the parts of your fa ce that are used to, basically, identify you – the parts of your face that make you  look the way you do. So, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your eyebrows – which are the lines of hair above your eyes – all of these would be considered “facia l features.”

Nadir says, “That’s why I made the forehead and chi n bigger, so no one will notice those ears.” The “forehead” (forehead) is the part of the head that is above your eyebrows and below where your hair begins – be low the top of your head, if you will. It’s the flat part of your face above you r eyes. The “chin” (chin) is the part of your face that is below your mouth and abov e your neck, formed by your “jaw” (jaw), which is where you find your teeth. Th at bottom part of your face, then, is called your chin. Many men, for example, g row beards that cover their chins. I don’t have a beard. Maybe I should get a b eard – a beard and earrings. Yeah. Why not?

Sonia continues, “But his legs look really thin on top and thick on the bottom, with kneecaps that stick out.” Your legs connect your fe et to the rest of your body, we could say. You have two of them. “Kneecaps” (kneeca ps) are small round bones found in the middle of your leg towards the front o f the leg, above your “knee,” which is the part of the leg that bends. You could think of it as the part of the leg that connects the top part with the bottom part. On  your arms, you have what’s called an “elbow” (elbow), which connects the top p art of your arm to the bottom part of your arm.

Sonia says that George Washington’s legs are “thin on top and thick on the bottom.” “Thin” is the opposite of “thick.” “Thin” would be very narrow, and “thick,” in this case, would be very wide. Nadir says, “I’ll  put pants on him, so no one will see those either.” Sonia says, “So, it won’t matter  if he’s anatomically correct, right?” “Anatomically” comes from the word “anatomy ” (anatomy), which is the study of the human body, the physical aspects of the human body.

“Anatomically” refers to the parts of the body, the  physical nature of your body. It could be a human body. It could be a body of an ani mal. To say something is “anatomically correct” means that it is just like a  real body. We would use this in describing perhaps a painting or, in this case, a l ife-size figure where it’s supposed to represent exactly what the body contain s. That’s why Sonia is saying that it won’t matter if George is not anatom ically correct. Nadir says, “Yes, that’s correct” – that’s right.

Sonia says, “Good thing this isn’t for science clas s!” Sonia says “good thing,” meaning it is a good thing, or it is fortunate, tha t this isn’t for science class. In a science class, of course, you would want the figure  to be anatomically correct so that you know the student understands the different  parts of the body and where they go and how big they are.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
