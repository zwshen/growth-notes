<h2>Problem H: Partitioning by Palindromes</h2>

<p>We say a sequence of characters is a <em>palindrome</em> if it is the same written
forwards and backwards.  For example, 'racecar' is a palindrome, but 
'fastcar' is not.

</p><p>A <em>partition</em> of a sequence of characters is a list of
one or more disjoint 
non-empty groups of consecutive characters whose concatenation yields the 
initial sequence.  For example, ('race', 'car') is a partition of 'racecar'
into two groups.

</p><p>Given a sequence of characters, we can always create a partition of these
characters such that each group in the partition is a palindrome!  Given 
this observation it is natural to ask: what is the minimum number of groups
needed for a given string such that every group is a palindrome?

</p><p>For example:
</p><ul>
<li> 'racecar' is already a palindrome, therefore it can be partitioned into one group.
</li><li> 'fastcar' does not contain any non-trivial palindromes, so it must be partitioned as ('f', 'a', 's', 't', 'c', 'a', 'r').
</li><li> 'aaadbccb' can be partitioned as ('aaa', 'd', 'bccb').
</li></ul>

<p>Input begins with the number <em>n</em> of test cases.  Each test case consists of a single line of
between 1 and 1000 lowercase letters, with no whitespace within.

</p><p>For each test case, output a line containing the minimum 
number of groups required to partition the input into groups of palindromes.

</p><h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>3
racecar
fastcar
aaadbccb
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>1
7
