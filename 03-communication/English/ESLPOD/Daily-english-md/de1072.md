This episode is a dialogue between Luisa and Max ab out working a job less than 40 hours a week – that is, a part-time job. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Luisa: Are you still here? I thought you got off at  three o’clock.

Max: I picked up a second shift. I could use the mo ney.

Luisa: But I thought you had another part-time job in the evenings.

Max: I normally do, but the restaurant where I work  has been cutting back my hours, so I’m trying to pick up as many extra shift s here as I can.

Luisa: And don’t you work at the amusement park on the weekend?

Max: I do half the year, but it’s winter and the pa rk only keeps a skeleton crew on during these months. In the meantime, I’m working f or a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignments.

Luisa: I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.

Max: I have no choice. I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.

Luisa: Have you ever thought about going back to sc hool to qualify for other work, something full-time?

Max: Sure, all the time. I’d like a better job, one  with benefits and a reliable salary.

Luisa: What’s stopping you?

Max: I have to pay for something called “food,” and  I haven’t met my fairy godmother yet!

Luisa begins her dialogue by saying to Max, “Are yo u still here?” This is one of those questions you ask when you’re surprised about  something – obviously Luisa can see that Max is still wherever they are. She says, “I thought you got off at three o’clock.” “To get off of work” means to fi nish your work schedule, to be able to leave the place where you work. If someone says, “What time do you get off?” they mean “What time do you get off of work?”  When do you stop working? What time do you stop working?

Max says, “I picked up a second shift.” A “shift” ( shift) refers to a period of time when people work. Usually this term is used for job s when people work at that particular location more than eight hours, or that there are people working at that location for more than eight hours. It might be, for example, a place where there is someone working 24 hours a day. Well, one person  is not going to work 24 hours straight, so they break up the day into shift s.

So, if you work the day shift, you’re working proba bly from eight in the morning until around four or five in the afternoon. If you working the night shift, you’ll be working perhaps from four or five in the afternoon to midnight. If you’re working what we call the “graveyard shift,” you’re working probably from 11:00 at night or midnight to seven or eight in the morning. Those are “shifts,” then – divisions of the workday in a place that usually is open for mor e than eight hours.

Max says he “picked up a second shift.” “To pick up ” here means to get, to obtain. He was working one shift, and now he’s pick ed up a second shift – which means, of course, he’s working more than eight hour s a day. Why has Max done this? Well, he says, “I could use the money.” When someone says, “I could use the money,” he means that he would be able to benef it from getting more money. He has some need of extra money.

Luisa says, “But I thought you had another part-tim e job in the evenings.” A “part- time job” is a job usually that is less than 40 hou rs per week. In the United States, 40 hours per week is considered “full-time. ” If it’s less than 40 hours, we might call it “part-time.” Luisa thought that Max h ad another part-time job. Max says, “I normally do, but the restaurant where I wo rk has been cutting back my hours.”

 When we talk about someone “cutting back” on someth ing, we mean that he is using less of it or he is reducing the number of so mething. The two-word phrasal verb “to cut back,” then, means to reduce the numbe r of something – in this case, we’re talking about the restaurant where Max works cutting back his hours. His “hours” refers to the number of hours that he can w ork. Max says he’s trying to pick up “as many extra shifts here as I can.”

Luisa then asks, “And don’t you work at the amuseme nt park on the weekend?” An “amusement (amusement) park” is a large park usu ally that has lots of what we would call “rides” in them – places where people , especially children, can play games and get into these machines that go really fa st, for example. Disneyland is an example of an amusement park here in Southern Ca lifornia.

Luisa asks if Max is still working at an amusement park on the weekends. He says “I do half the year,” meaning I do work there part of the year, “but it’s winter and the park only keeps a skeleton crew on during t hese months.” Max is saying that that the amusement park where he normally work s in the summertime only has a skeleton crew during the wintertime. The phra se “skeleton (skeleton) crew (crew)” refers to a very small number of workers – the minimum number of workers you can have at a place.

If the business doesn’t have very many customers, it might have very few employees, and we might call that a “skeleton crew”  if during busy times the company has more employees. This is the case with t he amusement park. It has a skeleton crew. The word “crew” just refers to a g roup of people. The word “skeleton” is normally used to describe the bones of your body or the bones of an animal.

Max says, “In the meantime,” meaning during this wi nter season, “I’m working for a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignment s.” A “temp (temp) agency” is a company that finds people temporary jo bs. The word “temp” is short for temporary, meaning short-term – not permanent, not for a long time. There are, of course, many companies that find workers, f ind people to work for companies that just need workers for a short period  of time.

Max says the temp agency gives him “short-term assi gnments.” “Short-term” refers to a short amount of time – perhaps a week, perhaps even a day. I used to work for temp agencies when I was in college. I wou ld call up every morning and see if they had any work for me, and they would sen d me to jobs that would last maybe one day, maybe two or three days, sometimes a s long as a month. Temp

agencies are very popular now, especially when the economy is not doing so well. Companies don’t want to hire employees full-t ime.

Luisa says, “I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.” The verb “to juggle” (juggle) usually refers to throwing objects up in t he air and keeping them up in the air. We refer to someone who does this as a “ju ggler,” but here the verb means to handle many different things at the same t ime, to be able to do many different things at the same time. Max says, “I hav e no choice” – I have no other option – “I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.” “To piece (piece) together” something means put together, to assemble. An “income” (income) refers to the money you get from working.

Max is saying that he has to work a little bit at t his job and a little bit at that job in order to make enough money to pay for his rent. Lui sa says, “Have you ever thought about going back to school to qualify for o ther work, something full- time?” “To qualify (qualify) for” something means y ou have the skills and/or education in order to be able to do something. So f or example, if you want to be a doctor, you have to study for many years in order  to qualify for that kind of job – at least, I hope you study many years if you’re a d octor. If not, please don’t to be my doctor.

Luisa is asking if Max has thought about going back  to school to qualify for some kind of job that would be full-time, that would be 40 hours a week. Max says, “Sure, all the time,” meaning I have thought of it a lot. He says, “I’d like a better job, one with benefits and a reliable salary.” “Ben efits” (benefits) refers to things such as health insurance and vacation time and sick  pay – money you get when you can’t work because you’re sick. These are commo n benefits that you get when you have a full-time job.

“Salary” (salary) refers to money that you get to w ork at a certain place, usually by the month or by the year. When we talk about a s alary, we’re talking about money you get regardless of how many hours you work . There are two kinds of ways of getting paid – one is by the hour, when you  get paid a certain amount of money for every hour you work. Another way of getti ng paid is by salary. When you’re getting paid on a salary, we would say you a re getting a certain amount of money and are expected to do your job, even if it t akes more than the normal 40 hours a week.

Luisa says, “What’s stopping you?” What’s preventin g you from going back to school? Max says, “I have to pay for something call ed ‘food.’” Max is making a joke here. He’s saying that he can’t afford to go b ack to school. He doesn’t have

enough money to go back to school because in additi on to paying his rent, he also has to eat, and to eat he has to buy food.

He finishes by saying, “I haven’t met my fairy godm other yet.” A “fairy (fairy) godmother (godmother)” is a character from children ’s stories – stories that we tell children – usually involving a woman who has s ome sort of magical powers. The fairy godmother is a common character in certai n fairytales that are told to children. These are made up stories about magical e vents. Here, Max is using the expression to mean that he hasn’t found someone  who’s just going to give him money to pay for his expenses and to go to scho ol.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
