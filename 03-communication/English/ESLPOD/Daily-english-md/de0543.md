This episode is called “Describing Different Smells.”  It’ s a dialogue between Julia and Giles talking about the different words we use to d escribe how things smell in English.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giles:  Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate th is place and turn it into a restaurant?

Julia:  It’s not so bad.  I know it smells a little sta le and musty in here, but all we need to do is air it out.

Giles:  Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than an airing out.  The kitchen smells putrid.  I wonder what died in there.

Julia:  There is a faint smell of something nasty in ther e, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?

Giles:  No, but there are different nasty smells in ot her parts of the building.  Oh! There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell in this corner.  Hold your breath!

Julia:  This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make  all the difference.

Giles:  That might be true for the kitchen, but what w ill you do in the dining room? An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perf ume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!

Julia:  All right, I’ll look for another building, bu t this place is cheap and within our budget.

 Giles:  Yes, but if I had to work here, I’d first have t o lose my sense of smell!

[end of dialogue]

Giles begins by saying to Julia, “Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate this place and turn it into a restaurant?”  “To renovate” means to improve a room or an entire building by usually rebuilding parts of it, e xpanding it, perhaps putting different decoration – different colors, that sort of t hing.  “To renovate” means to make new, in some ways, the room or the building.  Gil es wants to take a place, some place they own or are renting, and turn it into a  restaurant, meaning make it into a restaurant.  Maybe it was a store before, n ow it would be something different.

Julia says, “It’s not so bad.”  The place is not too bad is what she’s saying.  She says, “I know it smells a little stale and musty in here, b ut all we need to do is air it out.”  “Stale” is a way of describing a smell that i s not fresh, that is old; something that smells used could be described as stale.  “Mu sty” (musty) is something that smells like it’s slightly wet; it’s a very bad  smell, usually because there hasn’t been enough air circulation in a particula r area.  If you live in the northern part of the United States and your house has a  basement, sometimes in the basement it can get very moist, very damp, meaning th ere’s water there, and that can lead to a musty smell.  “To air (something) ou t” means to open windows or to do something to make the air move around the par ticular space so it dries out, smells better, gets rid of the bad smells.  You mi ght open a window, for example, to air something out.

Giles says, “Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than  an airing out.”  Notice he uses “airing out” as a noun, from the verb “to air (some thing) out.”  He says, “The kitchen smells putrid.”  “Putrid” (putrid) is the smell of something that is dead, something that is perhaps decaying, meaning that, for exa mple, it’s been sitting there for a long time and so it starts to come apart.  A human body, if it were left in a room – a dead body, that is – would start to decay.   It would start to change colors; it would start to smell bad.  Well, that bad sm ell we could describe as being putrid.  It doesn’t just mean it’s a dead body; there are other things that can smell putrid.  “Putrid” is perhaps one on the most nega tive words you can use to describe the way that something smells.  Giles says, “I wonde r what died in there.”  He’s joking; he doesn’t mean something actually is dead in there – although it’s possible!

Julia says, “There is a faint smell of something nasty in t here, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?”  A “faint (faint) smell” is a

 very slight, very small – so small you can almost not notice it.  “Faint” has a lot of different meanings in English in addition to this one.   Take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  “Nasty” (nasty) is somet hing that is very unpleasant; we might even say it’s disgusting or it’s gross .  It’s a very negative way to describe something.  You could say, “It was a nasty fi ght.”  The two people were fighting, they were yelling at each other , they were shouting, using bad language.  That would be a nasty fight.  Here, “n asty” means that the smell is very bad.  Julia says there’s a faint smell something nasty in  there, but she doesn’t think it permeates through the rest of the buil ding.  “To permeate” (permeate) means to be present in every part of somethin g – in every part of, in this case, the building.  If a nasty smell permeates the b uilding, we mean you can smell it everywhere in the building.

Giles says that he doesn’t think the nasty smell permeates through the rest of the building, but there are different nasty smells in othe r parts of the building.  He then says, “Oh!  There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell i n this corner.  Hold your breath!”  A “burnt (burnt) smell” would be someth ing that smells after it has been damaged by fire.  “Smoky,” similarly, means that some thing has been burning, or something has been producing smoke, and the  smoke is now the smell that you get when you go close to that object.  So if there’s a fire in the room, and there was a wooden chair, after the fire wh atever is left of the chair might have a burnt, smoky smell.  Giles says to Julia, “Hold  your breath!”  “To hold your breath” means not to breathe, usually because yo u don’t want to smell something.  You want to avoid a bad smell, hold your b reath.  It means not to breathe.

Julia says, “This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make all the difference.”  So I guess they’re in a building that had  a restaurant, but it’s an old one and it needs cleaning up.  Giles says, “That might b e true for the kitchen, but what will you do in the dining room (the place where people eat, or dine)?  An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perfume  couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!”  Gil es says that an entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perfume couldn’t  mask those fouls smells.  A “truckload,” here, would be the amount that you could put into a truck; more generally, it just means a large amount of somethi ng.  So he’s saying that even if we had a large number of scented candles – “scente d” means with a pleasant smell.  So you buy a candle, and you light it, a nd it gives off a pleasant smell.  That would be a scented candle.  I personally don ’t like scented candles, because I don’t think the smell is very pleasant at all usu ally.  Giles also mentions bottles of perfume.  “Perfume” is a liquid wi th a strong, pleasant smell. It’s used primarily by women.  When men use perfume, the y don’t call it perfume, they typically call it “cologne,” just so they don’t seem li ke they’re women I guess.

 I don’t know; it’s all perfume basically!  “To mask” (mask)  means to cover something, to make it difficult or impossible to see or smell or hear something.  In this case, make it difficult to smell something.  “Foul” (foul) is like the word “putrid,” something that is very unpleasant, something th at is very bad.  “Foul,” however, has some other meanings; take a look at the Lea rning Guide for those.

So going back, Giles says, “An entire truckload of scented ca ndles or bottles of perfume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just st inks, from top to bottom!”  “To stink” means to have a very bad smell.  Yo u would never want to say to your boss or to your girlfriend, “Boy, you really stin k!”  That is not a nice thing to say.  More generally, “stink” means to be very bad  at something.  So we could say, “Ah, that baseball player stinks.”  “David Beckham stinks,” for example.  I’m not saying he actually stinks; I don’t watch soccer so I don’t really know!  But when Giles says, “This place just stinks,” he mea ns it literally stinks; it smells “from top to bottom,” meaning the entire build ing – the entire room.

Julia says, “All right, I’ll look for another building, but this place is cheap and within our budget,” meaning we can afford it; we ha ve enough money for what we planned.  Giles says, “Yes, but if I had to work here, I ’d first have to lose my sense of smell!”  Your sense of smell is your ability to smel l.  We talk about the five senses: smell, see, hear, taste, and touch.  And then  of course, the sixth sense, which is the ability to see dead people – if you sa w the movie, you know what I’m talking about!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

Giles:  Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate th is place and turn it into a restaurant?

Julia:  It’s not so bad.  I know it smells a little sta le and musty in here, but all we need to do is air it out.

Giles:  Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than an airing out.  The kitchen smells putrid.  I wonder what died in there.

Giles:  No, but there are different nasty smells in ot her parts of the building.  Oh! There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell in this corner.  Hold your breath!

 Julia:  This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make  all the difference.

Giles:  That might be true for the kitchen, but what w ill you do in the dining room? An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perf ume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!

Julia:  All right, I’ll look for another building, bu t this place is cheap and within our budget.

Giles:  Yes, but if I had to work here, I’d first have t o lose my sense of smell!

There was nothing stale about this dialogue, because it was written by Dr. Lucy Tse.
