[start of dialogue]

Jordan: Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into t he hospital about two hours ago, but I can’t find her.

Admissions Clerk: Why was she brought into the hosp ital?

Jordan: I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworke r, but she didn’t give me any details.

Admissions Clerk: If it weren’t an accident, then s he wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.

Jordan: It may have been her heart. She has a heart  condition.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the cardiolo gy department. If she is in severe condition, she’ll be in the ICU.

Jordan: It may also be the baby. She’s pregnant.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the obstetri cs and gynecology department. And if the baby has been born, it would  be in the neonatal unit.

Jordan: I’m just not sure where to go. Maybe I’ll s tart in the cardiology department.

Admissions Clerk: That’s fine. Go past the neurolog y and oncology departments and it’s on your right. If you see the burn unit, t hen you’ve gone too far.

Jordan: You can’t look her up for me to see if she’ s been admitted?

Admissions Clerk: I’m sorry, but our computer syste ms are down right now. If you wait until they’re up again, I can try to find her for you.

Jordan: And go out of my mind worrying? No thanks. I’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins by Jordan saying to an employee  of the hospital, “Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into the hospital abo ut two hours ago, but I can’t find her.” Jordan is speaking to the admissions cle rk. If you are “admitted” to a hospital, that means that you are formally register ed, usually to stay overnight or to stay for a longer period in the hospital. The pe rson who takes care of the paperwork – of getting your information, your insur ance documents, and so forth – is called the “admissions clerk.” The word “admis sions” comes from the verb “to admit” – to let into.

The admissions clerk says, “Why was she brought int o the hospital?” Jordan says, “I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworker , but she didn’t give me any details.” The admission’s clerk says, “If it weren’ t an accident, then she wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.” The e mergency room in a hospital – sometimes called the “ER,” by its initials – is t he part of the hospital that treats or takes care of people who have very serious or da ngerous medical problems that need to be treated right away.

If you break your leg or you have a cut in your arm  and it’s bleeding, you would go to the emergency room. You can’t wait to make an  appointment to go see your doctor next week; you have to go right now. A “trauma (trauma) unit” is a part of a hospital that takes care of people who ha ve injuries like a broken leg, but not illnesses like influenza or some other dise ase. Trauma units take care of people who have had accidents – physical injuries t hat usually result from some activity such as playing sports or driving a car an d getting in a car accident, that sort of thing.

Jordan says, “It may have been her heart. She has a  heart condition.” A “heart condition” is when you have some problem with your heart, some problem that might be serious enough for you to go to go to a ho spital, for example. People

who have heart conditions can have a lot of differe nt things wrong with the heart. It’s just a general term. The admissions clerk then  says, “Then she might be in the cardiology department.” “Cardiology” (cardiolog y) is an area of medicine that deals with the heart. It’s the area of medicine tha t is concerned with the heart.

The clerk says, “If she is in severe condition, she ’ll be in the ICU.” The “ICU” is the “intensive care unit.” The word “unit” in a hos pital just means the section or area. Intensive care is when someone is very sick, perhaps even close to dying, and so you need someone to be watching over them, t o be looking after them, 24 hours a day. The intensive care unit is where peopl e go with all sorts of different kinds of illnesses and problems, but who are all in  danger of dying, really.

Jordan says, “It may also be the baby. She’s pregna nt.” “To be pregnant” (pregnant) means you are expecting a baby. You are expecting a child. The situation in this dialogue, as in other dialogues, is meant to reflect the changes that have taken place, in some cases, in the U.S. T hese are situations that are not necessarily the same as in other countries or, for that matter, even a few years ago here in the U.S. It has become common in past 20 years for a larger percentage of women to get pregnant before they get  married and even have children before they are married.

The admissions clerk says, “Then she might be in the obstetrics and gynecology department.” “Obstetrics” (obstetrics) is the area of medicine related to childbirth, to the care of women who are pregnant and are havin g a baby. “Gynecology” (gynecology) is the area of medicine that deals wit h illnesses and diseases affecting girls and women – affecting females. A ma n would not go to a gynecology department . . . unless you were the doc tor in the gynecology department. If you need more explanations about thi s, you can talk to your own doctor, or maybe your parents.

The admissions clerk says, “If the baby has been bo rn” – and of course, one would think Jordan would know if that were about to  happen – “it would be in the neonatal unit.” “Neonatal” (neonatal) is the part o f the hospital that takes care of babies who have been born very recently, usually wi thin, say, 24 hours of the birth. Jordan, who is quite clearly a confused pers on at this point, says, “I’m not sure where to go.” Of course, it seems unlikely tha t the girlfriend wouldn’t have a telephone – a cell phone – nowadays, but well, Jord an apparently doesn’t think of that.

He says, “Maybe I’ll start in the cardiology depart ment.” The admissions clerk says, “That’s fine” – okay – “Go past the neurology  and oncology departments and it’s on your right.” The “neurology (neurology)  department” is the part of the

hospital that takes care of people who have problem s with their brain and what is called the “nervous system.” The “nervous system” i s the way that the body communicates messages, or the brain communicates me ssages, to the rest of the body, you could say. So, if you have problems w ith your brain, like my neighbor, then you might be in the neurology depart ment.

There’s also a part of the hospital called an “onco logy (oncology) department.” An “oncology department” takes care of people who h ave cancer. The admissions clerk says, “If you see the burn unit, t hen you’ve gone too far.” In other words, if you are walking down the hallway of  the hospital, and you see something called the “burn unit,” you’ve walked too  far. You have to turn around and go back. The “burn (burn) unit” is the part of the hospital that treats people who have been burned by fire or some other hot obje ct.

Jordan says, “You can’t look her up for me to see i f she’s been admitted?” Jordan is asking the admissions clerk if she can gi ve him that information by looking it up. “To look someone up” is a phrasal ve rb meaning to search for that person – usually, nowadays, in a database that is i n a computer. “To be admitted,” as we mentioned earlier, means to be for mally taken into and registered at a hospital. Jordan wants to know if t he admissions clerk can just look up the information for him.

That isn’t always possible, especially if you’re no t a family member. In fact, in many hospitals there are strict rules about the kin d of information you can get by talking to the admissions office, but that doesn’t seem to be the problem here. The admissions clerk says, “I’m sorry, but our comp uter systems are down right now.” When we say the “computer systems are down,” we mean the computer isn’t working again. She says, “If you wait until t hey’re up again, I can try to find her for you” – if you wait until the computer syste ms are working, then the admissions clerk says she can try to find the girlf riend for Jordan.

Jordan says, “And go out of my mind worrying?” “To go out of your mind” means to go crazy, to become irrational – usually because  you’re very worried or anxious about something. Jordan says, “No thanks. I ’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan.” A “bedpan” (bedp an) – one word – is a small container that is used for people basically to do w hat they would normally do in a bathroom. But if they can’t get out of their bed, t hey need somewhere “to go,” we would say informally. That is what a bedpan is.

What Jordan is really saying is that he’s going to look everywhere to find her, instead of just waiting for the computer system to come back up.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jordan: Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into t he hospital about two hours ago, but I can’t find her.

Admissions Clerk: Why was she bought into the hospi tal?

Jordan: I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworke r, but she didn’t give me any details.

Admissions Clerk: If it weren’t an accident, then s he wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.

Jordan: It may have been her heart. She has a heart  condition.
