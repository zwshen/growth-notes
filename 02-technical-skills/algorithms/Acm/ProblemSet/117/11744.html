<h2>Problem C: Parallel Carry Adder</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11744.jpg" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>Let a and b be two 31-bit binary numbers.  Consider the following method for computing a+b.  Let c,d be 31-bit numbers
such that:
</p><ul><li>c<sub>i</sub> = 1 if a<sub>i</sub> ≠ b<sub>i</sub>
</li><li>c<sub>i</sub> = 0 if a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub>
</li><li>d<sub>i</sub> = 1 if a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> = 1
</li><li>d<sub>i</sub> = 0 if a<sub>i</sub> = 0 or b<sub>i</sub> = 0
</li></ul><p>Now, replace a with c and b with 2*d and repeat these steps until either b = 0
or b ≥ 2<sup>31</sup>.  In the former case, the resulting value of a is the sum
of the original numbers.  In the latter case, the sum of the original numbers
requires 32 bits to express so we say that an overflow has occurred.
</p>
<p>Your task is to print the results of all intermediate calculations and report if an overflow occurs.
</p>
<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>The first number indicates the number of test cases.  Each test case consists of two 31-bit numbers
a and b.
</p>
<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>The output for each test case is a series of lines. The first line
consists of a and b written in binary and separated by a space.
Following this, each line consists of the resulting values of a and b
when one iteration of the algorithm is applied to the values
in the previous line. Again, these should be written in binary and
separated by a space. If any of these numbers has value at
least 2<sup>31</sup> then the message "overflow" should be printed in place of the number.  The last line of output to
be printed corresponds to the iteration when either b = 0 or b ≥ 2<sup>31</sup>.  The output for consecutive
input cases should be separated by a blank line.
