This episode is a dialogue about your genealogy – w ho your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and so forth are.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Aaron: Do you think you can help me trace my geneal ogy?

Corrie: Sure, I can try. We can get started by talk ing to your parents and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some nam es of your relatives.

Aaron: I’ve already talked to them and I grew up he aring stories about my lineage on both sides of my family.

Corrie: That’s great. If you know of some of the pe ople you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and histo rical records from the area. You’re from Tennessee, right?

Aaron: That’s right. There are a lot of people in T ennessee with my last name, though.

Corrie: Well, we can triangulate the information we  get to zero in on your ancestors.

Aaron: What if I want proof positive that I’m relat ed to someone?

Corrie: Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.

Aaron: Good, it’s about time someone in my family e stablished the blood connections.

Corrie: Blood connections to whom?

Aaron: Elvis, of course.

Corrie: Elvis?! You think you’re related to Elvis?

Aaron: His last name was Presley; my last name is P resley. My first name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coi ncidence, especially considering my talent.

Corrie: Talent?

Aaron: Sure, listen: “Well, it’s one for the money,  two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!”

Corrie: I consider that counterevidence!

Aaron begins our dialogue by asking Corey, “Do you think you can help me trace my genealogy?” Your “genealogy” (genealogy) is a li st or a description of the relatives that you have – your parents, your cousin s, your grandparents, your uncles – all the way back to however far back you can trace your genealogy. The verb “to trace” (trace) here means to follow, to fi nd out where something begins.

People often talk about being able to trace their g enealogy back to medieval England or to the seventeenth century. Another term  for genealogy is “family tree.” Your family tree is the same as your genealo gy. It’s a list or description of all the people who are related to you, including al l of those who came before you. Corrie says, “Sure, I can try” – I can try to help you trace your genealogy, she’s saying. “We can get started by talking to your pare nts and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some names of your relative s.”

Your “relatives” (relatives) are the people who are  related to you, who are part of your family, either as brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents – any of those relationships refer to your “relatives .” Corrie suggests doing “oral interviews” – sitting down and talking to someone a nd either recording what they say or writing down what they say.

Of course, if you want to find out who your ancesto rs were – the people who came before you, your relatives from previous gener ations – you would need to or would be highly advised to talk to your grandpar ents and your parents to get started in finding out the names of the people who are related to you. Aaron says, “I’ve already talked to them,” meaning his pa rents and grandparents. “I grew up hearing stories about my lineage on both si des of my family,” he says. The term “lineage” (lineage) refers to a descriptio n of how you are related to someone in a previous generation or born before.

I use the term “generation” a couple of times here.  Let me explain what I mean by that. You and your brothers and sisters and your  cousins are all one generation. Your parents and your aunts and uncles are another generation. Your grandparents are another generation. You could  create a diagram or a chart that shows these different generations as different  lines on the chart or on the diagram.

Corrie says, “That’s great. If you know some of the  people you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and  historical records from the area.” The expression “to be descended (descended) from” someone means to be the child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so forth of a person. So, I am descended from my parents, Patrick and Mary McQuill an. I’m also descended from my grandparents and my great-grandparents. The se are people who came before me who are my relatives.

“Public records” refers to government records that anyone can go and look at. Not all the records or information that the governm ent has are public, however. Some of it is not information you can look at, but a lot of information that the government collects is public – anyone can go and l ook at it. That has been made even easier now with the Internet. “Historical  records” or “historical information” are written histories or written piece s of information about what happened in the past.

So, public records are also historical records in m any cases, but historical records can refer to other documents, other informa tion that is available, including perhaps a local history about the area fr om which your ancestors came. Corrie then asks Aaron, “You’re from Tennessee, rig ht?” Aaron says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “There are a lot of  people in Tennessee with my last name, though.” Corrie says, “Well we can trian gulate the information we get to zero in on your ancestors.”

Aaron is saying that he’s from the state of Tenness ee, which is located in the central-eastern part of the United States. However,  there are many different

people in Tennessee with his same last name. Theref ore, if you are looking in the public records or in historical records, there will  be a lot of people who have Aaron’s last name who may or may not be his relativ es. Corrie says that they can “triangulate the information.” “To triangulate” (tr iangulate) can mean to measure something that is the length or height of something  that you don’t know by using other measurements.

However, in a more general sense, “to triangulate” means to take different pieces of information in order to narrow down the options or in order to identify the relevant object or thing. In this case, it means to  take other information about the people who have Aaron’s last name in Tennessee and use that other information to decide which of the people who have his last nam e are actually his relatives. That’s why Corrie says, “We can triangulate the inf ormation we get to zero in on your ancestors.”

“To zero (zero) in on” something is to focus your a ttention on something, to identify one thing. In this case, they are identify ing Aaron’s ancestors – his relatives who came before him. Aaron then asks, “What if I want proof positive that I’m related to someone?” “Proof” (proof) is ev idence, clear evidence that shows something is either true or false. So, “proof  positive” would be clear evidence, detailed evidence that is absolutely cert ain, that tells you with certainty whether something is true or not.

Corrie says, “Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.” A “genetic analysis” is a study of biological information that can help identify who your relatives are. The most common way is to use your DNA. Your DNA is the specific biological infor mation that identifies you. “DNA” is the biological information inside your bod y’s cells, the smallest or one of the smallest units of your biological makeup. DNA d etermines a lot of different things about the individual human being and can be used to identify people who are related to you.

Aaron says, “Good. It’s about time someone in my fa mily established the blood connections.” “It’s about time” is a phrase that we  use to mean that we have been waiting for something for a long time, and now  we are pleased or happy to learn that it has finally happened. “It’s about tim e someone in my family,” Aaron says, “established the blood connections,” meaning the biological relationship.

Corrie’s a little confused. She says, “Blood connec tions to whom?” – to what specific person are you talking about? Aaron says, “Elvis, of course.” He means the famous singer Elvis Presley. Corrie says, “Elvi s?! You think you’re related to Elvis?” Aaron says, “His last name was Presley; my last name is Presley. My first

name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coincidence, especially considering my talent.” A “coincidence” is a somewh at surprising, unexpected set of events that happen at the same time or that are somehow related without any planning or apparent purpose.

In this case, Aaron is saying that he shares names with Elvis Presley and he also is talented like Elvis Presley. Corrie says, “Talen t?” Aaron says, “Sure, listen,” and then he sings a line from one of Elvis Presley’ s most famous songs: “Well, it’s one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!” That, of course, is a line from “Blue Suede Shoes,”  a song by Elvis Presley (sung very badly – I know).

Corrie says, “I consider that counterevidence.” In other words, she’s listened to Aaron sing, and she doesn’t think that the singing talent that Aaron has is anything like the singing talent that Elvis Presley  had. That’s why she says that Aaron’s singing is “counterevidence.” Countereviden ce would be some indication, some fact, that would show that what yo u are saying is not true or is not possible. Aaron’s bad singing shows, according to Corrie, that he’s probably not a relative of the great singer Elvis Presley.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

If I were to zero in on the main reason these podca sts are successful, I would have to say that it is the scriptwriting by the won derful Dr. Lucy Tse.
