This episode is called “Being Clear or Confusing.”  It’s a dialogue between Bethany and Laurent about explaining things, especially to someone else, that may be difficult for them to understand.  Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Laurent:  So I’m confused.  Who’s David again?

Bethany:  David is my roommate’s friend’s brother.  Haven ’t you been listening?

Laurent:  I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these people straight? Your stories are always so convoluted, with too many twists and turns.  Why don’t you try telling a straightforward story for once?

Bethany:  My stories are only confusing for people who do n’t pay attention or who can’t deal with complexity.

Laurent:  Complexity?  Is that what you call going off  on tangents and including completely irrelevant information?  Half the time the end of the story contradicts the beginning!

Bethany:  You just don’t appreciate intricate plots.  My stories are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention.  Good stories have lots of det ail.  Just ask Shakespeare.

Laurent:  Talk about delusions of grandeur!  When you st art comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you to seek professional he lp!

Our dialogue begins with Laurent saying, “So I’m confu sed.”  “To be confused” means not to understand what is happening or what is be ing discussed.  We might also say to feel puzzled.  Laurent says, “Who’s David again?”  Obviously, we’ve come in in the middle of a story in this dialogue,  and Laurent is trying to get Bethany to explain it better to him.

Bethany says, “David is my roommate’s friend’s brother.”  No tice in English that you can have a possessive of in front of a possessive in fron t of a possessive. Here, we have “my roommate’s friend’s brother.”  This is the brother of my roommate’s friend.  Bethany says, “Haven’t you been listeni ng?”  Laurent says, “I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these peopl e straight?”  “To keep (something) straight” (straight) means to be able to u nderstand something by keeping it well organized in your mind.  If you’re read ing a very complicated novel with lots of different people in it – lots of differe nt characters, like one of the Russian novels from the 19th and 20th centuries, they’re very difficult perhaps to understand – to keep everyone straight, to understand who  is who.

Laurent says that he cannot keep all of these people in B ethany’s story straight. “Your stories are always so convoluted,” he says, “with too many twists and turns.”  “To be convoluted” (convoluted) means to be very co mplicated, very difficult to understand or to follow.  “Twists (twists) a nd turns” is an expression that means there are many unexpected changes, making the st ory difficult to understand.  Sometimes you will go to see a movie and there’ll be many different twists and turns, there’ll be many different changes in the story that make it difficult to understand.  Laurent says, “Why don’t you tr y telling a straightforward story for once?”  “Straightforward” (one word) means un complicated, not difficult to understand, simple, direct.  “For once” is an expression  we use to mean that it doesn’t happen very often, that something is very rare; yo u want it to happen more often.  In this case, Laurent wants Bethany to tell  a simple, easy to understand story more often.  That’s why he says, “Why don’ t you try telling a straightforward story for once?”  The “for once” impli es Bethany doesn’t do it very often, but that she should.  For example, it would be  nice if my neighbor stopped yelling into his cell phone outside of my window for once , implying that he does it all the time – and he does!

Bethany says, “My stories are only confusing for people who d on’t pay attention, who can’t deal with complexity.”  “To pay attention” mea ns to listen, to try to understand, to follow something.  “Complexity” means ver y complicated, very convoluted, very difficult to understand because there are  many different parts of

 the story.  Bethany says that her stories are only confusing to people who can’t “deal with” complexity; that is, they can’t handle – they don’t know how to behave or think in a certain situation.

Laurent says, “Complexity?  Is that what you call going of f on tangents and including completely irrelevant information?”  “To go o ff on a tangent” (tangent) means to begin talking or writing about something that  is not directly related to the topic.  I do this all the time here on ESL Podcast and English Café.  I go off on a tangent; I start talking about something that isn ’t directly related to this episode.  Some people really hate that; they don’t li ke it, they can’t follow the story.  Laurent says that Bethany is including in her story co mpletely irrelevant information.  “Irrelevant” means not related to what  is being discussed, not connected to your main topic.  Laurent says, “Half the tim e (meaning most of the time, or at least 50 percent of the time) the end of the story contradicts the beginning!”  “To contradict” means to disagree with wha t has been already said, to say something opposite of what is said.  You should nev er contradict your wife, for example.

Bethany says, “You just don’t appreciate intricate plots.”   Something that is “intricate” (intricate) is something that is very detailed , we might say very involved; there are many different parts that work toge ther.  You can have something physical that is intricate: a watch, for example , or a piece of jewelry. In this case, Bethany is talking about the plots of her st ories.  A “plot” is what happens first, then what happens next, and so forth – the actual events of the story.  She says her plots are intricate.  “My stories,” she sa ys, “are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention.”  The expression “crystal clea r” means very direct, very easy to understand.  Very clear – no confusion.  She says,  “Good stories have a lot of detail.”  A “detail” is a single, small p iece of information about something, a single fact.  “Detail,” however, has other meanings in English, and those can be found in the Learning Guide.  Bethany says, “Just ask Shakespeare.”  Shakespeare, of course, was the great playw right who wrote very complicated, interesting plays.  “Just ask” is an expression w e use when we are trying to compare ourselves perhaps to someone else, or to make reference to someone else.  You’re using that someone else as an exampl e of something. For example: “The study of geometry is easy, just ask Euclid.”

Laurent says, “Talk about delusions of grandeur.”  “Delusi ons” are things that you imagine that are not true.  “Grandeur” is something ve ry powerful, something very important.  “To have delusions of grandeur,” however , means that you think that your ideas or that you are very important, very powe rful, more important than you actually are.  It’s often something we would associate with someone who

 perhaps has some sort of mental illness – someone who’s crazy.   So Laurent says, “Talk about delusions of grandeur.”  “Talk about” me ans this is a good example of.  “When you start comparing yourself to Shakesp eare, it’s time for you to seek professional help!” meaning when you get to the point that you are comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you “to  seek,” to look for, to get professional help.  Usually, “professional help” refers to  a doctor, especially a psychiatrist or perhaps a psychologist that will help you fin d a problem.  Usually what you are saying is that the other person is crazy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

The scripts for ESL Podcast are never confused or convolute d; they don’t go off on tangents.  They’re crystal clear, and yet intricate.  Thank you, Dr. Lucy Tse, who writes them.
