[start of dialogue]

Thierry: I know it’s casual Friday, but some people  just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.

Olga: I was thinking the same thing. Look at Sandy.  What she’s wearing is far too revealing.

Thierry: I was actually thinking about Jimmy. He’s wearing cutoffs and flip-flops. Where is his professionalism?

Olga: Don’t they know how they’re dressed can affec t their careers? Some people can’t see past poor fashion choices.

Thierry: Yeah, so many people are closed-minded and  think what people wear reflects their ability.

Olga: I’ve known a lot of people like that. Me? I a lways err on the side of caution.

Thierry: Is that why you never dress down?

Olga: That’s right. And I’ve noticed you don’t eith er.

Thierry: No, just because we suspend the dress code  one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.

 Olga: True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really  comfortable.

Thierry: Yeah, they do. It must be nice to walk aro und the office without dress shoes. Maybe, just once, I’ll come to work in short s next week.

Olga: What?! After everything you’ve said?

Thierry: I was thinking of tasteful shorts, nothing  tacky.

Olga: Just remember that it’s a slippery slope, my friend. I hope to never see you here in a tank top!

Thierry says to Olga, “I know it’s casual Friday, b ut some people just don’t know how to dress appropriately for work.” If something is “casual” (casual), it is not formal. It’s more relaxed. It’s, we could also say,  “informal.” Now, in most offices, in most businesses, everyone has to wear good cloth ing every day of the week. However, some offices have what is called “casual F riday,” meaning that you don’t have to wear, for example, a tie or a suit co at. You can dress more casually. You don’t have to dress, as we would say,  “professionally” or formally as you do every other day of the week.

Not all offices do that, but some offices do have t his casual Friday policy. Thierry is complaining, however, that even though it’s casu al Friday, there are some things that you shouldn’t wear to work. He says, “s ome people don’t know how to dress appropriately.” “To dress,” as a verb, means to put clothes on your body. The word “dress” is also a noun that refers to what  a woman would wear.

A “dress” is usually one piece of clothing that cov ers both the top and part of the bottom of a woman’s body, but as a verb, “to dress”  means simply to put clothing on, and “to dress appropriately” means to dress the  way you should dress for a certain situation. If you are going to a wedding, d ressing appropriately usually means wearing formal clothing, not your bikini or b athing suit. Although here in Los Angeles, that might be okay. I’m not sure.

Olga says, “I was thinking the same thing,” meaning  I agree with you that some people don’t know how to dress appropriately for wo rk. She then says, “Look at Sandy. What she’s wearing is far too revealing.” To  describe clothes as “revealing” (revealing) means to say that they show  too much of your skin. That

adjective is especially used for clothing a woman m ight wear that is showing too much of her bare skin, although it could be applied  to men’s clothing as well.

Thierry says, “I was actually thinking about Jimmy.  He’s wearing cutoffs and flip- flops. Where is his professionalism?” “Cutoffs” are  shorts that are made by cutting off the legs of pants, especially jeans. the key to “cutoffs” is that when you cut off the bottom of the pant leg, you don’t s ew up the bottom of the shorts, or what are now shorts, to make them look nice. So “cutoffs” are very informal. They don’t look very “dressy,” we might say. They d on’t look very formal. Of course they are shorts, and so by definition usuall y shorts are not formal wear.

“Flip-flops” (flip-flops) are basically a very simp le kind of sandal, which is something that you wear on your feet. It’s a type o f shoe that you wear on your feet that doesn’t have a top on it. That’s what a s andal is. “Flip-flops” are a type of sandal that you would wear to, say, the beach. T hat’s why Thierry is asking about Jimmy’s “professionalism” – that is, his abil ity to behave appropriately in a business or professional situation.

Olga continues complaining. She says, “Don’t they k now how they’re dressed can affect their careers?” She’s saying that the pe ople who are dressing this way don’t realize that the way you dress can affect how  well you do at work and what kind of jobs you can get. Olga says, “Some people c an’t see past poor fashion choices.” The expression “to not be able to see pas t” something means that someone is unable not to notice something even thou gh you are perhaps trying not to notice.

For example, if someone comes to you and asks for a  job, and that person doesn’t look like he dressed very well to meet you,  or perhaps didn’t comb his hair or shave his face, you – even though you think  this might be a good person – might not be able to see past the way the person looks. In other words, you can’t ignore it even though you want to, even thoug h you may think it’s not important the way a person dresses in terms of how he might be able to do a certain job.

Olga is saying that some people won’t be able to lo ok past the way these people are dressed when determining whether they are going  to give them jobs. “Fashion” (fashion) refers to the way that clothing  is designed, the way it looks. Thierry says, “Yeah, so many people are closed-mind ed and think what people wear reflects their ability.” Thierry is also compl aining about “closed-minded” people. “To be closed-minded” means that you only s ee your own opinion, or only consider your own ideas, and are not able to c onsider other people’s ideas.

The opposite of “closed-minded” would be “open-mind ed.” Thierry is describing closed-minded people as those who think that what p eople wear “reflects their ability.” “To reflect” (reflect) here means to be r elated to or to be an indicator of something. If I say, “The way you dress reflects yo ur ability,” I’m saying that the way that you look is an indication of how well you will do a certain job. Now, of course, we may know that that’s not true – unless t he job is to be a model, I guess – but nevertheless, people often think that.

Olga says, “I’ve known a lot of people like that” –  that is, who are closed-minded. “Me? I always err on the side of caution.” The expr ession “to err (err) on the side of caution (caution)” means to be very careful to n ot take any risks. I should mention that that word “err” (err) is now often pro nounced – somewhat mistakenly, but now more commonly – as “err,” as th ough it were spelled (air). In fact, it’s so common that it’s probably considered by most people an acceptable pronunciation in American English.

In British English, however, it is always pronounce d “err.” What does “err” mean? it means to make an error. It means to make a mista ke. You can see why people pronounce the word “err” (air) instead of “err” (er r) because we also have the word “error,” which is pronounced with that “air” s ound instead of an “err” sound – but anyway, back to our story.

Thierry says, “Is that why you never dress down?” H e’s asking Olga the reason why she never dresses casually. “To dress down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to dress casually. Olga says, “That’s right . And I’ve noticed you don’t either.” Olga and Thierry are saying to each other that because other people are closed-minded and might think that the way one dres ses reflects one’s abilities, they themselves never dress casually at work, even on casual Friday.

Thierry says, “No, just because we suspend the dres s code one day a week doesn’t mean we have to dress inappropriately.” A “ dress code” (code) refers to rules about how you are supposed to dress. “To susp end” (suspend) means to stop doing something for a short period of time, to  temporarily stop doing something. Olga says, “True, though both Sandy and Jimmy look really comfortable.”

Thierry says, “Yeah, they do. It must be nice to wa lk around the office without dress shoes.” “Dress shoes” are formal shoes. “Mayb e, just once, I’ll come to work in shorts next week.” Thierry and Olga are say ing that it is, in fact, more comfortable to dress casually, and perhaps they sho uld do the same thing as everyone else. Olga says, “What?! After everything you’ve said?” She’s surprised

that Thierry is thinking of wearing shorts after cr iticizing other people for wearing shorts.

But Thierry says, “I was thinking of tasteful short s, nothing tacky.” If something is “tasteful” (tasteful), it shows good judgment. It l ooks, we might say, “classy” or “refined.” Something is tasteful if it is dignified , appropriate especially for a formal setting. The opposite of tasteful is “tacky” (tacky ). “Tacky” is something that shows poor judgment, something that is of, we might  say, a low class.

Olga says, “Just remember that it’s a slippery slop e, my friend.” A “slippery (slippery) slope (slope)” is a term used to describ e a decision or an action that could in the future lead to problems, especially if  we are talking about changing the rules or doing some sort of action that may see m small now but would later cause further problems.

An example: if I say to my teenage daughter, if I h ad a teenage daughter, “You must be home by ten o’clock tonight and you cannot come home later than ten o’clock.” My daughter might say, “Well, Dad, I want  to come home at 10:15.” And you say, “Oh, well, okay, 10:15.” You may start goi ng down a slippery slope. My daughter or son might come back to me and say next week, “Well, you said I could come back at 10:15, why not 10:30? It’s only 15 minutes later.”

You see here now the problem – that now that you ha ve allowed her to come back 15 minutes later once, she’s going to start pu shing you so that it will be even later, and later, and later. That’s what we wo uld call a “slippery slope.” One small action, one small change in the beginning, ca n lead to problems in the future. Olga is worried that if Thierry wears short s next week, it will be a slippery slope – that is, in the future he’ll wear even more  casual clothing.

She then ends with a joke. She says, “I hope to nev er see you here in a tank top.” A “tank (tank) top (top)” is a shirt that doe sn’t have any sleeves on it, and usually the shirt has a very narrow piece of, or st rip of, material over the shoulders. Both men and women can wear tank tops. T ank tops show the skin of your shoulders and around your neck as well.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
