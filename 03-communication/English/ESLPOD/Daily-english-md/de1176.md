[start of dialogue]

Gloria: Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He to ok a job with another company.

Sam: I’m not surprised. He came up against the glas s ceiling and he decided to jump ship.

Gloria: Really? I didn’t know he was bucking for pr omotion.

Sam: He’s been trying to become a manager for three  years, but other people have been promoted over him or they’ve hired from o utside the company.

Gloria: I didn’t know that. I was aware of the wage  disparities within the company and the gender pay gap within each department, but this is news to me.

Sam: Haven’t you noticed that people who take exten ded leave to have children or try for some type of work-life balance are passe d over for plum assignments, raises, and promotions? There are definite limits to advancement.

Gloria: I thought it was just favoritism on the par t of the bosses. Their friends got promoted and other people didn’t.

Sam: That’s certainly true, but that’s only part of  the story.

Gloria: Why are we still working for a company with  such unfair policies?

Sam: Speak for yourself. I’m giving notice today.

The title of this episode is “Limits to Advancement  at Work.” “Advancement” would be getting a higher level or going to a highe r level – in this case, getting a better job at the company where you work. Gloria be gins by saying to Sam, “Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He took a job wit h another company.” Sam says, “I’m not surprised. He came up against the gl ass ceiling and he decided to jump ship.” The term “glass ceiling” (ceiling) refe rs to a limit on how far you can go in your career, in your job, for reasons that ha ve nothing to do with how good you are at your job.

In other words, it’s a limit that is unfair and imp osed by or placed by someone else, perhaps the rules of the company or the cultu re of the company. The term was originally used to refer to the idea that women  and some racial and ethnic minorities were not able to get better jobs because  of some sort of discrimination against them. The “ceiling” of a room is the top of  the room. A room has a floor, a ceiling, and typically four walls.

A “glass ceiling,” if you can imagine such a thing,  would be one that you couldn’t see if you looked up because it’s made of glass – u nless, I guess, the glass was dirty. But anyway, the idea is that you wouldn’t no tice it. It wouldn’t be something you could see, but if you actually went up to the t op of the room, you would hit the glass ceiling and wouldn’t be able to go any hi gher, any farther up. And that’s, you can see, the metaphor here for what mig ht limit you in a company that discriminated against you for some reason related to your sex or your race or some other reason.

Sam says that Manuel “came up against the glass cei ling,” meaning apparently he had been discriminated against, “and he decided to jump ship.” “To jump ship” (ship) is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to quit y our job or to leave an organization and to go to another job with another company or organization. You could also use this phrasal verb when you leave or quit some job or organization even if you don’t have another job. I guess I’ve he ard it used more often in a case where someone has moved to a different company , say.

Gloria is surprised to hear that Manuel was having these problems. She says, “I didn’t know he was bucking for promotion.” “To buck  (buck) for promotion” or “to buck for a promotion” is to work hard to try to get  a better job within your company. Sam says, “He’s been trying to become a ma nager for three years, but

other people have been promoted over him.” “To be p romoted” (promoted) means to get a better job within a company. The ver b is “to promote.”

Sam thinks that other people have been promoted ove r Manuel, meaning instead of Manuel getting the job, other people have gotten  a job that Manuel wanted or the company has hired from outside their own compan y, finding someone from another company. Gloria says, “I didn’t know that.”  Then she says, “I was aware of the wage disparities within the company.” “Wage”  (wage) refers to how much you make per hour. A “disparity” (disparity) is a d ifference between two things or two people or two groups of people.

“Wage disparities” would refer to differences in ho w people are paid. The idea here, however, is that not only are people paid dif ferently, but once again, they’re being paid differently for some reason that doesn’t  seem fair, that might be discriminatory. Apparently, that’s what’s happening  at this company where Sam and Gloria work. Gloria says she was aware of this,  this case of wage disparities, “and the gender pay gap within each department.” A “gender pay gap” would be differences in how men and women are paid.

The word “gender” (gender) has changed meaning over  the years. We used to use “gender” in talking just about languages such a s French or Italian or Spanish, where the nouns have gender – feminine and masculin e. However, more recently, the word “gender” has come to replace the  word “sex” to refer to men and women. So, instead of talking about “sex discri mination,” people talk about “gender discrimination.”

There’s another political idea behind the change in  the use of the word “gender,” which has to do with whether something called “gend er” is the same as something called “sex” – biological sex – but I won ’t go into that discussion here. For us, the important thing to know is that “gender  pay gap” refers to differences in the way men and women are paid at a company base d on whether they are men or women. That’s the idea. The word “gap” (gap)  is a difference between two things – in this case, between the amount of mo ney you’re getting paid by the company.

Gloria says she was aware of the wage disparities w ithin the company and the gender pay gap within each department or part of the company, “but this is news to me” – that is, it’s news that Manuel was trying to get a job and that he was not successful. Then Sam adds, “Haven’t you noticed tha t people who take extended leave to have children or try some type of work-lif e balance are passed over for plum assignments, raises, and promotions? There are  definite limits to advancement,” Sam says.

 The word “extended” (extended) means long, or longe r than normal. A “leave” (leave) is a period of time when you leave your job  but you are planning on coming back. You may leave for a month or two month s or maybe even longer, but the idea is that you’re not quitting your job –  you’re going to come back and work for the company. You may be paid during your l eave, or it may be an “unpaid leave,” where you don’t get any money from your company but you get your job back when your leave is over.

So, an “extended leave” would be when you stop work ing for your company, usually for several months. People may take an exte nded leave when they have children. A woman may take what is called a “matern ity leave” – that is, when she has her baby, she may decide not to work for th ree months or six months or perhaps longer, and then go back to work. Fathers a re also sometimes given leave in companies. We would call that a “paternity  leave,” I guess. But you may take an extended leave for some other reason.

According to Sam, people who take extended leave to  have children, “or try for some type of work-life balance are passed over for plum assignments.” A “work- life balance” is when you try to usually not work a s hard so that you can enjoy your life more. It relates to the attempt by some p eople to have a good family life as well as a good work life.

He says, “People who take extended leaves for work- life balance are passed over for plum assignments.” “To be passed over” mea ns that you are not given something but the next person is. Manuel apparently  has been taking extended leave and is surprised that he’s being passed over for “plum assignments.” A “plum (plum) assignment” is a very good assignment,  a very good job. Anything that is “plum” is good or attractive. “Plum” is als o a kind of fruit, of course, but here it means a very good job, a very good assignme nt in the company.

These people who take these extended leaves are als o being passed over for raises. A “raise” (raise) is when you get more mone y for doing the same amount of work. “There are definite limits to advancement, ” Sam complains, and I should think there should be, if you’re taking extended le aves and then expecting to get paid the same as people who don’t get extended leav es, but maybe I’m crazy.

Gloria says, “I thought it was just favoritism on the part of the bosses.” “Favoritism” (favoritism) is when you like one kind  of person or one particular person for reasons that don’t seem fair, that have nothing to do with that person’s qualifications. Gloria thought the reason some peop le were getting raises and

promotions was because the bosses were promoting an d giving raises to their friends.

Sam says, “Well, that’s certainly true, but that’s only part of the story,” meaning that’s not the only reason this has been happening.  Gloria complains, “Why are we still working for a company with such unfair pol icies?” “Unfair” is not fair, not just, not treating everyone equally. A “policy” is the rules or the regulations that a company follows – the way that the company does bus iness. Gloria is wondering why she and Sam are still working for this apparent ly unfair company.

Sam says, “Speak for yourself,” meaning he’s not go ing to continue working for this company. “I’m giving notice today.” “To give n otice” means to tell your company that you are quitting, that you are no long er going to work there. I’m not sure if Gloria and Sam’s company will be all that d isappointed to see them leave. But there you go.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
