This episode is a dialogue between Irene and Kent.  It uses vocabulary we would talk about in describing a formal competition or to urnament.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Irene:  How is your team doing in the standings?

Kent:  They’re seeded sixth and they’re in a bracke t with one of the best teams in the tournament.  Our team has already lost to them.

Irene:  I thought it was a double-elimination tourn ament.

Kent:  It is.  That’s the only reason they’re not o ut of contention for the title.

Irene:  Why did the organizers get rid of the round -robin rounds?

Kent:  I think it’s because they wanted to cut down  on the number of games overall.  I’m not sure.

Irene:  Your team is the defending champion.  What happened this year?  Why aren’t they ranked higher?

Kent:  They didn’t have a very good season.  There were a lot of injuries, and as the coach, I had some run-ins with a couple of the new players.  Let’s just say we had some clashes in personality.

Irene:  Isn’t there a game this afternoon?

Kent:  Yeah, but I have to feed my team first.  The y won’t play until they get what they want.

 Irene:  What do they want?

Kent:  Ice cream.  Who knew six-year-olds could be so demanding?

Our dialogue begins with Irene saying, “How is your  team doing in the standings?”  The “standings” (standings – plural) m eans the list of how good a set of teams are.  Standings always relate to the r ankings: is your team in first place, in second place, in last place, and so forth .  So in any competition, especially a sports competition where you have diff erent teams playing over a long period of time, you will have standings – you will have rankings.  Some will be best, some will be worst.  Well, one will be bes t and one will be worst – you get the idea.

Kent says that his team is seeded sixth and they’re  in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  “To be seeded” comes  from the verb “to seed” (seed), which here means that you put an athlete or  a team in a certain position in a tournament so that the better the team, the mo re likely they are to advance in the tournament.  It can be quite complicated, bu t basically where you are seeded in a tournament determines whom you will be playing.  Kent says that his team is in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  The best way to understand a bracket is to take an example.  Let ’s say that you have eight teams, and you want to determine who is the best am ong the eight teams.  So you have team A play team B; team C plays team D.  The winner of the A-B game plays the winner of the C-D game.  And then, f or the other four teams – E and F, G and H – E plays F, G plays H, and the winn er of those games play each other.  Then finally, the winner of the A-B-C-D “br acket” or side of the tournament plays the winner of the E-F-G-H side of the tournam ent.  So, a “bracket” is the – you can think of it as the A and B is a bracket, or  the A, B, C, and D could be considered a larger bracket or section of the tourn ament.  Kent is saying that his team is in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  So if his team is A and team B is the best team, well, he’s in a d ifficult bracket – or his team is. A “tournament” is just another name for a competiti on to determine who is the best person in this game, whatever the competition is about.

Irene says, “I thought it (meaning the tournament) was a double-elimination tournament.”  There are different kinds of tourname nts – different kinds of competitions to determine who is the best team or p layer.  One kind is called a “double-elimination.”  “Elimination” is when you lo se and are out of the tournament.  That is, you can no longer go forward.   Now my example of the

eight teams is what we would call a “single-elimina tion” tournament.  That is, if you lose once that’s it, you don’t play anymore.  in a double-elimination tournament it’s more complicated.  You actually hav e to lose two games before you are eliminated from the tournament; that’s doub le-elimination.

Kent says yes, it is a double-elimination tournamen t.  He says, “That’s the only reason they (meaning his team) is not out of conten tion for the title.”  “To be in contention” (contention) means that you can still w in; it’s still possible for you to be the champion – the best player.  “To be out of c ontention” is the opposite; it’s to be eliminated from the tournament or to be in a place where you can no longer win first place.  Kent says that his team is not ou t of contention for the title.  The “title” here just means the winning position, first  place, number one.  “Title” has some other meanings in English as well; take a look  at our Learning Guide for those.

So Irene then asks, “Why did the organizers (the pe ople who organized or put the tournament together) get rid of (or eliminate) the round-robin rounds?” “Round-robin” (robin) is another kind of tournament ; we’ve talked about single- elimination and double-elimination.  A “round-robin ” tournament is where all of the teams play each other.  So A plays B, A plays C , A plays D, A plays E, F, G, and H; all of the teams play each other.  It’s a mu ch longer kind of tournament, and usually only works when there are a smaller gro up of teams and when you have a lot of time.

Kent says, “I think it’s because they wanted to cut  down on the number of games overall.”  What Kent is saying is that he believes the organizers eliminated the round-robin rounds – that is, they got rid of them – because they wanted to decrease or cut down on the number of games overall .  “Overall” here means the total number of games.  But then he says, “I’m not sure.”

Irene says, “Your team is the defending champion.”  The “champion” is the winner, the number one position, the person who win s the tournament. “Defending” here means the person or the team that won it last time or last year. So if the Dodgers win the World Series – my favorit e baseball team – next year they would be the defending champions because they won it last year. Unfortunately, they haven’t won it since I think li ke 1988, so they are not exactly defending champions!  But if they did win last year , then they would be the defending champions this year, and if they win this  year they would be the defending champions next year, and so forth.  Irene  asks, “What happened this year?  Why aren’t they ranked higher?”  That is, wh y isn’t his team ranked or put into a higher position in the tournament.  “Rank” h ere is related to the idea of being seeded in a tournament.

 Kent says, “They didn’t have a very good season.”  A “season” is the period of time when games are played for that particular spor t.  The football season is from, I don’t know, late August to, say, January.  The American baseball season is from April to October.  Those are the months or the time periods when the teams play.  Kent said, “There were a lot of injuri es (meaning a lot of players got hurt), and as the coach, I had some run-ins with a couple of the new players.”  A “run-in” is a disagreement with someone, a fight wi th someone.  “I had a run-in with my boss the other day.”  That means I had a di sagreement or an argument with my boss.  Kent says he had a run-in with a cou ple of the new players on the team.  He says, “Let’s just say we had some clashes  in personality.”  The expression “let’s just say” is used when we don’t want to give the person a lot of information about the topic; we don’t want to give them a lot of details, so we’re trying to make a general statement – a summary stat ement about what happened.  Kent says, “Let’s just say we had some c lashes in personality.”  A “clash” (clash) is an argument or disagreement betw een two people who have different opinions or beliefs about something.  “Cl ash” has a number of other meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for som e additional explanations. And of course, The Clash was a famous punk rock gro up back in the late 70s- early 80s when I was a young person, many years ago .

Irene says, “Isn’t there a game this afternoon?”  K ent says, “Yeah (yes), but I have to feed my team first (he has to give them som e food).  They won’t play until they get what they want.”  Irene says, “What do they want?”  Kent says, “Ice cream.  Who knew six-year-olds could be so demandin g?”  “To be demanding” means to need a lot of special attention and care, which usually creates a lot of work for other people to take care of you.  Of cour se, we find out that the team that Kent is coaching is not an adult team; it’s a group of six-year-old children.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
