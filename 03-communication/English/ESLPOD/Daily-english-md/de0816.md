This episode is a dialogue between Jimmy and Rosali nd about starting a new program, a program that’s testing something. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rosalind:  How is the pilot program coming along?

Jimmy:  We’ll be ready to launch it in another mont h, but I have some serious reservations.

Rosalind:  Like what?

Jimmy:  We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet a nd we might come up against some resistance from the community.

Rosalind:  Isn’t that the nature of a pilot program ? When you’re paving the way, you’re always going to have skeptics and dissenters .

Jimmy:  You’re right, of course, but there’s a lot at stake. I just hope this trial run will win over some of those skeptics. It would be a  shame to scrap this program after we’ve put in so much work.

Rosalind:  After the program is launched, you’ll ha ve six months to prove its worth, right?

Jimmy:  Yeah, that’s right.

Rosalind:  That’s plenty of time for the dissenters  to see the light.

Jimmy:  From your lips to God’s ears!

Rosalind says to Jimmy, “How is the pilot program c oming along?” A “pilot” (pilot) here means something that you are doing to test a p rogram, to test an idea, to see whether it will be successful. Usually, a pilot  program is with a small group of people. First you test it with a small group of peo ple and then, if it is successful, if it works, you use it with a larger group of people.  That’s a pilot program. The word “pilot” has a couple of different meanings in English, however. Take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those. So Rosalin d says to Jimmy, “How is the pilot program coming along?” meaning, how is it pro gressing? How is it developing? How is it going?

Jimmy says, “We'll be ready to launch it in another  month, but I have some serious reservations.” To “launch” (launch) means to start something new, at least that’s what it means here, to do something for the first time. You might launch a new product for your business. You're goin g to start selling something that you’ve never sold before. That’s to launch, to  begin a new project or a new activity. Jimmy says, “I have some serious reservat ions.” “Reservations” are doubts, concerns, worries about something.

Rosaline says, “Like what?” In other words, give me  an example. Jimmy says, “We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet.” To “wo rk out all of the bugs” is a phrase meaning to fix all the problems. This is esp ecially used when we're talking about software problems. “Bugs” are problems. Bugs can also be little insects, little animals, but here it means a problem in some thing, in some program, perhaps even a computer program. Well, Jimmy says they haven’t worked out all of the bugs. They haven’t gotten rid of them. They haven’t solved all the problems.

He says, “And we might come up against some resista nce from the community.” To “come up against” means to be opposed by someone  or something, or it can mean simply to face, to confront. “I've come up aga inst some problems,” meaning I now have some problems that I didn’t see before or that I perhaps didn’t realize were there. Jimmy says that they mig ht possibly come up against some resistance from the community. “Resistance” is  opposition. When people don’t want to do something or even want to stop som ething. Sometimes we talk about governments and resistance movements. Resista nce movements would be people who are against the government, who try to stop it or oppose it. Here, Jimmy is worried about resistance, opposition from the community. (We're not sure what that “community” is.)

 Rosalind says, “Isn't that the nature of a pilot pr ogram?” “Nature” (nature) here means the way something is done or a characteristic  or feature of something. So, when she says, “Isn't that the nature of a pilot pr ogram?” she means, well, that’s what a pilot program is supposed to help you with. She says, “When you're paving the way, you're always going to have skeptic s and dissenters.” To “pave (pave) the way” means here to do something for the first time, to be the first person or group to do something, which of course is  always more difficult than the second or the third or the fourth person to do something. If you're the first person, it's more difficult. If you are doing thing s that other people are going to be able to do after you, that is particularly a situat ion appropriate for this expression, “to pave the way.”

Rosalind says, “You're always going to have skeptic s and dissenters.” A “skeptic” (skeptic) is someone who questions or doubts whethe r something will work, someone who doesn’t believe in another person’s ide as, who’s always going, “Well, maybe not, I'm not sure. I don’t think that’ s right.” That person would be a skeptic. More common would be the adjective “skepti cal.” I'm very skeptical about this idea. I have a lot of doubts. I don’t th ink it's right. A “dissenter” (dissenter) is a person who “dissents” (dissents). The verb “to dissent” means to have a different opinion than the majority of peopl e, to disagree with something. Usually, you're disagreeing with most of the other people.

Jimmy says, “You're right, of course, but there's a  lot at stake.” The expression “at stake” (stake) means at risk or in question or that could be affected by this, so this is an important thing, he’s saying. There's a lot at stake. “I just hope this trial run will win over some of those skeptics.” A “trial  (trial) run” is an attempt to do something first before you do it with a larger grou p or do it on a larger scale. Really, it's the same as a pilot program. A trial r un is, “I'm going to test it to see if it works before I use it with 1,000 people,” for ex ample. “Win over” is a phrasal verb meaning to persuade, to convince, to change so meone’s opinion so that they will agree with you – someone who’s a dissente r or a skeptic, for example. “To win them over” means to get them to say, “Oh, o kay, I agree with you.”

Jimmy says, “It would be a shame to scrap this prog ram after we've put in so much work.” When we say, “It would be a shame” (sha me) – meaning it would be sad, it would be disappointing, it would be unfortu nate – “It would be a shame to scrap this program.” To “scrap” (scrap) means to de cide not to continue to do something, or to throw something away. More often, it means to stop supporting or promoting a particular project or idea. We're go ing to scrap this project or we're going to scrap this program. It means we're g oing to eliminate it. We're going to “delete” it, if you will.

 Rosalind says, “After the program is launched (afte r it is started), you'll have six months to prove its worth, right?” To “prove (prove ) something’s worth (worth)” means to demonstrate or to show that something work s, that it's valuable, that it should be continued. Jimmy says, “Yeah, that’s righ t.” They’ll have six months to prove its worth. Rosalind says, “That’s plenty of t ime for the dissenters to see the light.” The expression “to see the light” means to understand something that was difficult, perhaps to understand before or to under stand a very important, perhaps even profound thing, so that now you're going to ch ange your mind. You're going to change your actions even. Rosalind is saying tha t in six months, the dissenters, the people who don’t like this program,  will see the light. They’ll agree with Jimmy.

And Jimmy says an old expression, “From your lips to God’s ears.” “Lips” (lips) are the two things that form your mouth. You have a n upper lip and a lower lip, two of them. The idea here is from your mouth, from  what you say, to “God’s ears.” This is another way of saying, “I hope what you are saying is true.” It's sort of like, “I hope that God hears you,” hears what yo u're saying, and therefore will give me my wish, will make this successful. “From y our lips to God’s ears” means I hope what you just said really is true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
