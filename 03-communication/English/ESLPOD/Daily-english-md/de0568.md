On this episode, we are going to be talking about when  business is good – when a company is doing well, when they are doing brisk busine ss, a lot of business – and when they are doing not so well, slow business.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Clint:  Anya!  Long time no see.  Let me buy you a dri nk.  I’m celebrating.

Anya:  Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?

Clint:  My company has had a banner month.  Since we lau nched our new line of software, we’re having trouble keeping up with demand.   Every product is flying off the shelves.

Anya:  Wow, that’s great news.  Everybody I talk to is singi ng a different tune. Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.

Clint:  That’s too bad.  I thought that Yao’s company w as doing brisk business. Six months ago, he was selling a line of cell phones tha t was all the rage, and customers were beating down his door to get one.

Anya:  That was six months ago.  It’s a different story now .  Those cell phones are now considered passé, and he has inventory he can’t un load.  You know how fickle the market is.

Clint:  I’m sorry to hear that.  How about you?  How’s the travel business?

 Anya:  Why do you think I’m sitting here crying in my beer?   Pull up a chair and I’ll tell you my sob story.

[end of dialogue]

Clint begins by saying, “Anya!  Long time no see.”  This is an old expression which means it’s been a long time since we have seen each o ther.  “Long time no see.  Let me buy you a drink.”  Of course, if he’s bu ying her a drink that means they’re in, usually, a bar and the drink will be a  beer or wine, possibly a Cuba Libre with a little bit of lime on top – yeah!  So Clint says, “I’m celebrating.” He’s happy about something; something good has happened and he wants to celebrate.

Anya says, “Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?”  Clint says, “ My company has had a banner month.”  When you say you’ve had a “banner  (something),” as an adjective, it means very good, better than expected.  We o ften use this in talking about a company and how much it is selling, or how wel l is doing, but it could also be, for example, about a person: “Charlie had a b anner year.  He got good grades, he found a new girlfriend, and he won the lo ttery.”  That would be quite a year!  Actually, he won the lottery and then got the ne w girlfriend, so if you’re looking for a new girlfriend just win the lottery!

Clint continues, “Since we launched our new line of sof tware, we’re having trouble keeping up with the demand.”  “To launch (some thing)” means to start a new project, a new program, maybe even a new business.  I n this case, Clint’s company is starting – is starting to sell a new line of sof tware.  When we use the word “line” in talking about business products or services we  mean they are a group of related products.  Sometimes we use this term in talking about the name or the brand of a product, for example: “He likes the  Guess line of jeans.”  That’s the kind of jeans – the brand, the name – the specific ki nd of jeans that he likes. But in that line, usually there are several different p roducts that are somehow related or similar.

Clint’s company is launching a new line of software, and they’re having trouble keeping up with the demand.  “To keep up with (somethi ng)” is a phrasal verb meaning to be able to reach something, to be able to  do what you’re required to do.  In this case, you’re able to keep up with demand.  The “demand” is people who want to buy things from you; it’s the willingness of  people to buy your product.  There’s two parts in any business: there’s supply, which is what you produce, and then there’s demand, which is what people want.  So, Clint’s company needs to keep up with the demand, or keep up wit h demand, meaning

 they need to make sure they have enough things to sell for the people who want to buy them.  He says, “Every product is flying off the she lves.”  The expression “to fly off the shelves” (shelves) means to sell something v ery quickly.  A “shelf” is like a flat area where you put things in a store so peop le can see them.  Usually there are more than one shelf, so there are several she lves (the plural).  “To fly off the shelves” means to sell something very quickly, So Clin t’s company is selling these pieces of software very quickly.

Anya says, “Wow, that’s great news.  Everybody I talk to is sin ging a different tune.”  A “tune” is like a song; it’s music.  “To sing a d ifferent tune” (tune), however, means to have a different experience than some one else, usually to have a different experience because something has changed a lot.  For example, Anya says that although Clint’s company is successful, other pe ople she has talked to – other businesses – are not successful.  She says,  for example, “Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.”  “Foot traffic” is the number of people who come into a store or a business that come in to by something.  So, if there are fewer people coming, there are fewer peopl e buying, and therefore business will be slow.

Clint says, “That’s too bad.  I thought that Yao’s compan y (Yao must be the name of a friend of theirs) was doing brisk business.”  “ Brisk” (brisk) is an adjective that means very fast; often it means with a lo t of energy, with a lot of excitement.  When we use it to talk about business, howeve r, we mean that they have lot of success, that they’re selling things very quickly.  Clint says, “Six months ago, Yao was selling a line of cell phones that was all the rage.”  When we say something is “all the rage” (rage), we mean it i s very popular, something that suddenly becomes popular and everybody wants to buy it .  A few years ago there was a dance song called “The Macarena,” many years a go.  It was all the rage; everyone wanted to get this song.  [Jeff sings]

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena Que tu cuerpo es pa’ darle alegria y cosa buena Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena Hey Macarena

I’m very sorry about that; really, I am!  Well, that’s wh at we mean by “all the rage,” very popular.  So, Yao’s company was popular six mon ths ago in fact, customers were beating down his door to get one of the se cell phones.  “To beat down (someone’s) door” is a phrase that means to do anyt hing to get this product.  In this case, it means that the product is very p opular, that all of the customers wanted to buy one of these cell phones.

 Anya says, “That was six months ago.  It’s a different story n ow.  Those cell phones are now considered passé.”  When we say something i s “passé” (passé), with an accent mark over the “e” because it is a foreign  word, we mean it is no longer popular, it is old-fashioned; out of date, we might say.  Anya says that Yao has inventory he can’t unload.  “Inventory” are the thing s that a company owns. So if you makes cell phones, somewhere you have a bunch of cell phones in your building ready to sell.  That’s your inventory.  “To  unload,” in this case, means to sell.  But “unload” can also mean to give somet hing away, especially if nobody wants it.  To try to get rid of something is ano ther meaning of unload. “Unload” has other meanings as well, as does the word “ banner” that we began our dialogue with; look at the Learning Guide and you ’ll find more explanations. Anya continues, “You know how fickle the market is.”  “Fickle ” (fickle) means to change your mind frequently, especially about what you like  and don’t like.  One day I like popcorn, the next day – eh – I don’t really want any.  I’m fickle; I change my mind a lot.  Anya says “the market,” meaning people wh o are buying things or business in general is fickle – it changes quickly.

Clint says, “I’m sorry to hear that.  How about you?  Ho w’s the travel business?” So apparently Anya is in the travel business: airlines, rai lroads, that sort of thing. Anya says, “Why do you think I’m sitting here (here in the  bar) crying in my beer?”  The expression “to cry in your beer” means to dri nk beer or alcohol because you are sad or depressed and you think that the be er will make you feel better.  So, “to cry in your beer” means to be sad and  to try to make yourself happy by having a beer.  Anya says, “Pull up a chair and I’ ll tell you my sob story.”  “To pull up a chair” literally means to take a ch air and put it next to someone to talk to them.  More generally, it means sit d own and listen to someone who is going to tell you a story.  So you pull up  a chair when you are about to listen to a story, and if someone says “pull up a chair,” they mean listen to my story.  Her story is a sob (sob) story.  “To sob,” as a verb, means to cry very emotionally; a “sob story” is a sad story, something that  would make you cry: “The girls spent all night talking about their sob stories related to their ex- boyfriends.”  Something you might want to do over a bee r!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clint:  Anya!  Long time no see.  Let me buy you a dri nk.  I’m celebrating.

Anya:  Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?

 Clint:  My company has had a banner month.  Since we lau nched our new line of software, we’re having trouble keeping up with demand.   Every product is flying off the shelves.
