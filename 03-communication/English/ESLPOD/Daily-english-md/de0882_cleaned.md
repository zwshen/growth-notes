[start of dialog] 

Patricia:  What are you doing? 

Luis:  I’m setting up a practical joke for Bobby.  I can’t wait to see the look on his face when he walks outside and finds his bike in pi eces.  It’ll be the best prank ever! 

Patricia:  You’re not really going to take apart hi s bike, are you? 

Luis:  I’ll let you in on the joke.  He’ll just be looking at spare parts.  I’ve hidden his bike in the garage.   

Patricia:  He’s really going to freak out when he t hinks that you’ve run over his bike with the car, though.  I think this is more cr uel than mischievous. 

Luis:  Lighten up!  When he realizes he’s the butt of the joke, he’ll think it’s hilarious, trust me. 

Patricia:  Couldn’t you just play some other kind o f practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion? 

Luis:  A whoopee cushion?  That’s child’s play.  Th is practical joke is worthy of a master prankster!

Patricia begins our dialogue by saying to Luis, “Wh at are you doing?” Luis says, “I'm setting up a practical joke for Bobby.” “To se t (set) up” is a phrasal verb meaning I'm getting ready, I'm getting organized, I 'm putting together. Luis is putting together a practical joke. A “joke” is when  someone says something funny. It could be a story. It could be something e lse that makes us laugh. A “practical joke” is some sort of physical action, s ome sort of trick, that’s supposed to be funny. The trick is always on another person.  So, you do something so that the other person looks silly or foolish, not very i ntelligent. That's what a practical joke tries to do. It tries to make another person l ook silly, look ridiculous.  

Well, Luis is setting up a practical joke for Bobby . We often use the verb “to play a practical joke,” which is in the title of this ep isode. Luis is going to play a practical joke for Bobby or “on” Bobby. “I can't wa it to see the look on his face,” Luis says, when he walks outside and finds his bike  in pieces. The expression “I can't wait to something” means I'm really looking f orward to something. In this case, Luis is looking forward to “the look on Bobby 's face” when he sees what has happened. He's looking forward to the reaction that Bobby will have when he walks outside – outside of their building, where th ey’re working probably – and finds, or discovers, his bicycle “in pieces.”  

When we say something is “in pieces” (pieces), we m ean it has been taken apart. It has been disassembled with all the individual pi eces laying on the ground, or on the floor. So Luis has taken Bobby's bike and he  has taken it apart. He has just assembled that and now the bike is in pieces. 

Luis says, “It will be the best prank ever.” A “pra nk” (prank) is another word for a practical joke. More recently on a popular televisi on program, instead of using the term practical joke or prank, they use the verb “to  punk” (punk). “To punk” here means the same as to play a practical joke on someo ne. In the television show “Punk’d,” they play practical jokes on famous peopl e, typically on celebrities.  

Patricia says, “You're not really going to take apa rt his bike, are you?” Luis says, “I'll let you in on the joke.” “To let someone in o n a joke” means to let someone know how you are going to do your practical joke, h ow you're going to play your practical joke, giving them the details of what is going to happen. Of course, Bobby doesn't know what’s going to happen.  

Luis is going to tell Patricia. Luis says, “Bobby w ill just be looking at spare parts.” “Spare (spare) parts” are things that you use, typi cally, when you have a machine and it breaks down, you need to fix just part of th e machine. We would call the thing you use to fix it with, that you replace the old thing that doesn't work with, “spare parts.” Luis is saying that when Bobby sees his bicycle, it will look like it's  

just a bunch of parts, just a bunch of pieces. “I'v e hidden his bike in the garage,” Luis says.  

So now we understand what Luis is doing. He's not actually  going to take Bobby's bike and take it all apart and leave it on the ground. He's going to take some spare parts, some other parts of another bicyc le, and put that on the ground, or I should say put those on the ground, those  parts on the ground. Bobby's real bike will not be the one on the ground . It will be in the garage. That's the joke.  

Patricia says, “He's really going to freak out when  he thinks that you've run over his bike with the car, though.” So, that's the tric k. Luis is going to pretend like he ran over the bike. “To run over” means to hit and a ctually have the, in this case, car drive over the bicycle, which of course, I don' t recommend, if you have a bicycle – or least you should get off the bicycle b efore someone runs it over. 

Anyway, Patricia is talking about how Bobby is goin g to “freak out.” “To freak (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become very upset, very angry, to lose control of yourself. It's an informa l way of saying to go wild or to go crazy, to be so angry you start yelling and screami ng.  

Patricia says, “I think this is more cruel than mis chievous.” “Cruel” (cruel) means very mean – when you are trying to hurt another per son. “Cruel” is something that is not kind. “Mischievous” (mischievous) is us ed to describe a thing or person who is causing problems or causing trouble, but usually in a fun way, or at least in order to be funny. It's an adjective we  would most typically use with children who are getting into trouble. They’re not bad children (except my neighbors children). But they’re children that are causing problems.  

Luis says to Patricia, “Lighten up.” This expressio n “lighten (lighten) up” is a phrasal verb meaning relax. Don't take things so se riously. Don't get so excited. Try to have more fun.  

Luis says, “When Bobby realizes he's the butt of th e joke, he'll think it's hilarious, trust me.” “To be the butt (butt) of the joke” mean s you are the person that people are laughing at. You are the person who has had thi s practical joke played on, or more grammatically, on whom the practical joke has been played. Luis says, “Bobby will think it's hilarious.” “Hilarious” (hil arious) means very funny.  

So, Bobby will think this is very funny. That's wha t Luis says. He says, “Trust me,” meaning believe me. I know what I'm talking ab out here, Patricia. Lighten up, Patricia, seriously.   

 Patricia says, “Couldn’t you just play some other k ind of practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion?” A “whoopee (whoopee) cushi on (cushion)” is basically a small rubber bag that has one opening in the bag so that when you sit on it, it makes a noise. It makes a funny noise. The ideas th at you would put this cushion underneath someone, and they wouldn't realize they were going to sit on it, and then when they sit down it makes a funny noise. It' s the sort of thing you would see in an old 1930’s or 1940’s movie, perhaps. 

Luis says, “A whoopee cushion? That's child's play. ” The expression “child's play” means something is very easy to do, something doesn 't require any planning. It's too easy. That's the idea. Luis says, “This practic al joke is worthy of a master prankster.” “To be worthy of something” means it's good enough for, or it's appropriate for. Luis is saying this joke is so goo d, that it is something that you would only expect normally from a master prankster.  A “master” here means an expert, someone who knows a lot about something. A “prankster” is a person who plays practical jokes on other people. A “prank ster” is a person who is always creating these pranks to make other people l ook foolish. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
