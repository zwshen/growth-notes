This episode is called “Being a Strict Parent.”  It’s a d ialogue between Allison and Ola, and you’re going to learn about this particular parent and all of the rules that she wants her daughter to follow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Allison:  I’m almost ready for my granddaughter’s visit.  She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everything to be perfect.

Ola:  What do you have planned?

Allison:  I’m going to spoil her rotten.  My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.

Ola:  Like what?

Allison:  Well, her time is very structured and regimente d.  She’s never allowed any time for just frivolous fun.

Ola:  And you’re taking off the shackles.

Allison:  That’s right.  She can play as much as she wants t o for the next week.  I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences just because her mother is overprotective.  There will be no curfews and no time sche dules.

Ola:  Are you sure that’s a good idea?  I’m sure your daughter has instructions about how your granddaughter should behave and the pu nishments she should get if she misbehaves.

 Allison:  You’re right about that.  I’m expecting a lo ng list of rules for my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe the line.  I’m the grandmother after all, so I have special privileges.   Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.

Ola:  How did a free spirit like you end up with a da ughter who is so uptight?

Allison:  Beats me.

Ola:  She’s not going to thank you for spoiling her da ughter, you know.

Allison:  I know, but I’m her  mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach he r about raising a daughter!

[end of dialogue]

Allison begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m almost ready f or my granddaughter’s visit.”  Her “granddaughter” would, of course, be the daughter of either her son or daughter.  “She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everyt hing to be perfect.”  Ola says, “What do you have planned?”  Allison replies, “I’m g oing to spoil her rotten.”  “To spoil (spoil) (someone) rotten (rotten)”  means to do something nice for another person, especially a child, never doing anyth ing negative, never yelling at them, always doing nice things for them, givin g them whatever they want for example.  Most parents try not to “spoil their  children,” meaning they don’t want their children to get used to getting goo d things all the time, and then when they don’t get good things they don’t “behave,” or  they don’t act appropriately.  This expression actually can also refer to vegetables or fruit or meat, any type of food that after a few days will begi n to go bad so that you can’t eat it anymore.  When food spoils, we say that it has be come rotten.  That means it’s no longer something you can eat because it’s gone bad

Allison says, “I’m going to spoil my granddaughter rotten .  My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.” “To be strict” means to insist that someone follow all of the rules, without making any exceptions.  You must do everything according to the rules.  So, a strict parent is someone who has a lot of rules for their chil dren, and expects them to follow all of these rules.

Ola says, “Like what?” meaning give me an example of one of these rules. Allison says, “Well, her time is very structured and regimen ted.”  To say something is “structured” means that it has a lot of org anization, it’s very

 organized, it can’t be changed.  We might say it’s “infl exible,” you can’t change it. “Structure” has a couple of different meanings in Engl ish however.  You can get the other meanings by going to our website and downloa ding the Learning Guide for this episode.  “Regimented” means with a definit e order, a definite discipline, almost like the military – almost like the army.  In fact,  the word “regiment” can also mean a group of soldiers.  Here, it simply means ve ry ordered, very disciplined, not changing.

Allison says her granddaughter is never allowed any time f or just frivolous fun. Something that is “frivolous” (frivolous) is something just  for fun, something that isn’t serious, something that has no important meaning.  Sometimes, “frivolous” can be a criticism, meaning someone isn’t very serious; the y don’t take anything seriously.  Here, it just means fun, just to have fun, no educational or other purposes for it.

Ola says, “And you’re taking off the shackles.”  “To take off ” is a phrasal verb meaning to remove.  “Shackles” are, literally, heavy pieces of metal that you put around someone in prison, on their arms and sometimes o n their legs.  So “shackles” would be something that would put on a priso ner – someone in jail. Here, the expression means to remove restrictions or limi tations.  “To take off the shackles” doesn’t mean that her granddaughter is actually w earing shackles – we hope not!  It means that the grandmother wants to rem ove these rules and strict regulations that her granddaughter has to follow fr om her mother.  This, of course, is what grandparents often do.  When they have th eir grandchildren over, they feel they can be as nice to them – not have to discipl ine them, because, after all, that’s the job of the parent.  I never kne w my grandmother, so I don’t know if that’s true.  They were dead by the time I was old enough to know who they were.

In this dialogue Allison says that she’s going to take off the shackles from her granddaughter.  She says, “She can play as much as she want s to for the next week.  I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning not to be able t o enjoy or participate in something, to miss an opportunity.  “Don’t miss out on seeing the movie tomorrow.”  That means don’t miss the opportunity, when  you have it, to do that thing.  “Miss” is a verb that has several different meani ngs also.  You know where you can find those, in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Allison says she doesn’t want her granddaughter to miss out  on any experiences just because, or only because, her mother is overprotective.   Someone who is “protective” tries to keep someone else safe.  But to be  “overprotective” means that you’re trying to protect them so much that you are t aking away their

 legitimate freedom.  You’re not allowing them to li ve a normal life because you’re protecting them too much.  Sometimes parents can be overp rotective of their children; husbands may be overprotective of their wives.  I n this case, Allison is saying that the mother of her granddaughter – her dau ghter – is overprotective.

Allison says, “There will be no curfews or no time schedule s.”  A “curfew” (curfew) is the time when someone, usually a child or a young adult, must be home, and after which they cannot go outside again.  So me places have official curfews, saying that anyone who is less than 18 years old, for example, must be at home or with one of their parents.  Usually parents have curfews for their high school children, telling them they need to be home befo re, say, 11:00 at night, or 10:00 at night on days when there is school.  Those are cu rfews.  Governments sometimes, when there is a lot of violence in a particula r place, will have a curfew.  My parents never gave me a curfew.  I think they expected that I would behave myself and not get into trouble and be home at  a reasonable time.  I have, however, lived under one case of a curfew from the government.  In 1992, after the “riots,” the violent actions of some people af ter a certain court case had finished – the riots caused the police here to issue a cur few.  You could not be out on the street after the sun went down.  That laste d, I think, for about a week or so.  I wasn’t actually living in the City of Los Angel es at the time, so it didn’t affect me very much.  That’s quite unusual, however, for  the government to “impose,” or to tell people they have to “abide,” or f ollow, a curfew.

Well, Allison will have no curfews for her granddaughte r.  Ola says, “Are you sure that’s a good idea?  I’m sure your daughter has instructi ons about how your granddaughter should behave (should act) and the punish ments she should get if she misbehaves.”  A “punishment” is something you make someon e do if they’ve done something wrong.  If you commit a crime the govern ment will give you, for example, a punishment of going to prison for a year.  “ To misbehave” is the opposite of to behave; “to behave” means to act properly,  act appropriately.  “To misbehave” means to do things wrong.  We use this word in  talking about children: “The children are misbehaving.”  My neighbor’ s children are misbehaving every day, right outside my window!

Allison says, “You’re right about that (you’re right abo ut my daughter having these punishments).  I’m expecting a long list of rules f or my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe (toe) the line.”  “To toe the line” means to follow the rules, to do what you are told to do.  Allison says, “I’m the grandmother after all, and I have special privileges (spe cial rights, special advantages because of who I am).”  In other words, gra ndmothers can do what they want with their grandchildren.  “Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.”

 Ola said, “How did a free spirit like you end up with a  daughter who is so uptight?”  A “free spirit” is someone who does whatever they want to do, who doesn’t follow the rules, who doesn’t care what other people think.  “Uptight” is the opposite.  “Uptight” (uptight – one word) means t o be very worried, anxious, not relaxed.  “Uptight” is really an insulting term, it ’s a negative way to describe someone.  Just because a parent has rules, doesn’t mean th ey’re uptight, but Ola uses the word to describe Allison’s daughter.

Allison answers his question, “Beats me.”  The expression “b eats (beats) me” is an informal one used to show that you don’t know the a nswer to something. Someone says, “What time is it?”  If you don’t know, you co uld say, “Beats me, I don’t know.”

Ola says that Allison’s daughter is not going to thank you for spoiling her daughter.  Allison says, “I know, but I’m her  mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach her about raising a daughter!”  When somebo dy uses the expression “a thing or two,” they mean many things, especially when you’re talking about how much a person knows about something.  Someone says, “Do  you know about iTunes or podcasting?” and if you do, you could say, “I know a thing or two,” meaning you probably know a lot about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
