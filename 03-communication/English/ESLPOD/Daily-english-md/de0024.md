# Taking Credit

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 24 – Taking Credit.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 24. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we are going to discuss problems a t the office. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: You're not going to believe what happened.

Lucy: Oh, is the big meeting over? What happened?

Jeff: Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the  new campaign.

Lucy: You're kidding me! I thought he might try to pull something like this, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve to do that.

Jeff: Yeah, and to top it off, he said that he did it all by himself.

Lucy: He's unbelievable. What a jerk! He slacks off  for the last two weeks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.

Jeff: Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'm  going to talk to the senior vice president. I think she'll listen.

Lucy: Are you sure? I think she's fair-minded, but maybe she thinks we should work it out with Dan ourselves. She might no t want to step in.

Jeff: Well, can you think of another way to handle this?

Lucy: I wish I could. I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout. Maybe the senior VP will end up thinki ng we can't fight our own battles.

Jeff: Yeah, you're right. I'm just so ticked off ri ght now I can't think.

Lucy: That's probably the problem. We both need to cool off so we can think straight. Let's get some coffee and see what we can  come up with.

 Jeff: That sounds good. But if I see Dan on the way  out, I'm going to floor that guy.

Lucy: Yeah. That makes two of us.

In this episode, Lucy and I talked about problems a t the office after one of our coworkers – someone with whom we work – took credit  for one of our ideas. “To take credit for an idea” means to say that it was y ou who came up with or thought of an idea, when really it was someone else's idea.  We began by talking about how one of our coworkers, Dan, tried to take credit  in a meeting for our idea for a new campaign.

In business, a “campaign” (campaign) is a plan for marketing or advertising a new product or service, a new thing that you are se lling. You are going to put ads in the newspaper and on television and on the Inter net, but you first must develop a campaign. We also use the term “campaign”  when talking about politics. A politician who is running for office – that is, trying to get elected, trying to get people to vote for him or for her – runs a p olitical campaign. So, “campaign” refers both to advertising a product or service and to advertising a candidate who wants to be elected to the government . Maybe there's some connection between the two. I don't know.

I told Lucy that “Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the new campaign,” and Lucy says, “I thought he might try to pull somethin g like this.” “To pull something” here means to do something dishonest – to do someth ing that is not right or that violates or breaks some rule. It's an informal expr ession that we would use probably among our family and friends. We use it wh en talking about people who are doing something wrong, usually for selfish reas ons, for their own advantage – in order to get something for themselves. “I though t he might try to pull something like this,” Lucy said.

Lucy says she didn't think he'd have the nerve to d o it. “To have the nerve” (nerve) means to have the courage or to have the st rength to do something. It's usually used in a negative way. When someone “has t he nerve” to do something, it often means that they are being very bold about doing something wrong. They are not afraid to do something wrong. For example, if you are standing in line and someone decides not to wait, but to walk right up t o the front of the line – which

we call “to cut in line” – you could say, “He had t he nerve to cut to the front of the line.”

We also have a more informal expression, “to have t he guts” (guts), which is very similar to saying “to have the nerve.” Although “to  have the guts” or “to have guts” can also be a positive thing. It can show that you are strong, that you have courage. I then tell Lucy, “Yeah, and to top it off , he said that he did it all by himself.” “To top it off” means there is even more to a story than what you already know or what you have already been told.

So, for example, I order a pizza to be delivered to  my house, and the pizza delivery person – the person who brings the pizza –  arrives one hour late. And you say, “Oh, I can't believe he was so late.” And I say, “Yes, and to top it off, it was the wrong pizza.” So, in this case we are using  the expression “to top it off” to describe something bad that gets even worse. Dan , in our story, tried to take credit for our idea. And to top it off, he said tha t he did it all by himself.

Lucy calls Dan a “jerk” (jerk). “What a jerk,” she says. This is a very negative term, an insulting term. It's not a vulgar term. It 's not what we would call a “dirty word,” but it is an insult. A “jerk” is someone who  harms you, who does something wrong to you. There are a lot of expressi ons for that in every language, I'm sure. It's a negative term to describ e someone who hurts you in some way. “What a jerk.” But because it's not a for mal term, you wouldn't want to use it in a formal business setting unless you were  talking to friends, as is the case here in our story with Lucy and me.

Lucy says that Dan “slacks off for the last two wee ks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.” “To slack (slack)  off (off)” is a two-word phrasal verb that means not to work as hard as you should. “I'm feeling kind of lazy, so I think I'm going to slack off this week” means I'm n ot going to work very hard this week. That's what my boss says about me every week.  A person who “slacks off” is called a “slacker” (slacker). “Don't be a slacke r” means don't be lazy. Do your work.

Dan “doesn't lift a finger.” Someone who “doesn't l ift a finger” is someone who is lazy, who doesn't help at all. For example, I was s tanding in line at the bank and a woman dropped her check. The person in front of h er, however, didn't lift a finger to help her pick it up. He didn't do anythin g, in other words, to help her.

In the story I say, “Dan is not going to get away w ith it.” “To get away with” something means to do something wrong, to break a r ule or to break a law, without anything bad happening to you. You could sa y, “I got away with cheating

on my exam.” Not me, of course. Or you could say, “ I got away with not doing my homework.” You didn't do your homework and you were  not punished for it. You got away with it. Lucy describes our boss as “fair- minded.” “To be fair-minded” (fair-minded)” is to be honest, to be fair, to list en to both sides of an argument.

Lucy says our boss might think “we should work it o ut with Dan ourselves.” “To work it out” means to resolve a dispute or to solve  a problem. Our boss “might not want to step in.” “To step in” means to enter i nto an argument or a discussion. So, if there are two people fighting wi th each other and you “step in,” it means you get involved in the fight or the argum ent or the discussion, often to resolve the issue or to solve the problem. For exam ple, a parent has two children who are fighting. So, she “steps in” and stops them  from fighting.

I asked Lucy, “Can you think of another way to hand le this?” “To handle” (handle) something is a very common expression in English. “ To handle” means to take care of some problem or to resolve some issue. Lucy  says, “I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout.” “To blow something off” – and it requires both words, “blow” and “off” – means to ig nore it, not to pay attention to it, not to do it. “Are you going to hand in your pr oject today?” You say, “No, I'm feeling lazy. I'm going to blow it off.”

This phrasal verb can also be used in a situation –  when you are going to take time off. “Let's blow off work and go to the beach, ” for example. You could also blow off an appointment. “I was supposed to go to t he doctor today, but I decided to blow it off,” meaning I decided not to go. Lucy says, “We have to think of the fallout.” When we have a problem that is going to a ffect or influence other people, we sometimes use the expression “the fallout.” “Fal lout” (fallout) literally means the radioactive particles after a nuclear explosion  – the radiation that makes people sick and can kill them. That's technically w hat “fallout” is.

But usually when we talk about the “fallout” from a  situation, we mean the results or the consequences of some event. For example, aft er Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans several years ago, part of the fallout was that many people criticized our government for not doing more. That would be considered part of the fallout – the results or the consequences of the main event.

Lucy worries that our bosses will think “we can't f ight our own battles.” A “battle” (battle) is a large fight, usually between two armi es. We use the phrase, however, “to fight your own battle” to mean to take  care of your own problems – on your own, without asking for anyone else's help.  I say, “I'm just so ticked off.” “To be ticked (ticked) off (off)” is an informal ex pression that means to be angry. “I'm really ticked off” means I'm really angry. I'm  really mad at somebody.

Sometimes we just say “I'm ticked” without saying t he word “off.” “I'm ticked” means the same as “I'm ticked off.” You could also say, “Don't tick her off,” meaning don't make her mad, referring to your wife.

Lucy says, “We both need to cool off so we can thin k straight.” “To cool off” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to calm down, to s top being so angry. “To think straight” means to think clearly, to think lo gically. When you can't think straight, it usually means you are tired or angry o r confused. I then say, “If I see Dan on the way out,” meaning if I see him as I am l eaving the office, “I'm going to floor that guy.” “To floor” (floor) someone means t o hit someone so hard that he falls onto the floor. Of course, I am not, in real life, a violent person. So, I wouldn't actually floor Dan. But that's what it literally me ans.

We also use the expression “to floor” when we’re ve ry surprised by something. “He told me the news and it floored me” means that the news was so shocking, it made me fall down on the ground. Not literally, but  the idea is that it was very shocking. But here when I say I want to floor Dan, I mean I actually want to hit Dan. Lucy says, “That makes two of us.” When two pe ople agree on something or when two people do the same thing, we sometimes say, “That makes two of us.” For example, if I say “I'm feeling really tire d,” and my friend says, “Yeah, that makes two of us,” that means “I feel tired too. I f eel the same way you do.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
