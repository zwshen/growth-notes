This episode is a dialogue between Hugo and Shawna about building things with wood and metal. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Hugo: Wow, when you said that you did some woodwork ing on the weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture. But this! This is a real workshop and you’re actually building furniture. 

Shawna: Yeah, this is what I’m working on right now . I’m building a dining table and chairs.  

Hugo: The grain is beautiful on this piece of hardw ood. It certainly looks better than the plywood furniture I have in my house. What  is all this? 

Shawna: Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and d rills.  

Hugo: And what is all this metal for? 

Shawna: I’m adding some grillwork for the back of t he chairs. I don’t usually do metalwork, but I’m keeping it simple. 

Hugo: This doesn’t look simple. These pieces have b een welded together, and is that used for soldering?  

Shawna: You got it. When all is said and done, I’ll  have a new dining room set with a large table and eight chairs. 

Hugo: Wow, I’m impressed.  

Shawna: Want to try your hand at it? 

Hugo: No thanks. You see these 10 fingers? I’m rath er fond of them.

This episode is all about building things. We begin  with Hugo saying to Shawna, “Wow, when you said you did some woodworking on the  weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture.” “Wow” is an expre ssion of surprise. Hugo is surprised when he sees what Shawna is doing.  

Shawna is doing some “woodworking.” “Woodworking” i s making things out of wood, the material. “Wood,” of course, comes from t rees. You cut the tree down in order to get the wood that you use to build thin gs with. Shawna is interested in woodworking, and she does it on the weekends – on S aturdays and Sundays.  

Hugo thought that Shawna had been “refinishing furn iture.” “To refinish” furniture is just to make the surface or outside of the furni ture look more beautiful – to do something to the wood in order to make it look bett er. This is very different than actually building something, of course. What Shawna  has been doing is building things, not just changing their appearance on the o utside.  

Hugo says, “But this! This is a real workshop and y ou’re actually building furniture.” A “workshop” is a large room where peop le do work, especially physical things like building furniture or repairin g motors. The term “workshop” is also now used in other situations where we’re talki ng about an area or a place where everyone is working on the same thing.  

Sometimes we use this word for a type of meeting, a  type of educational meeting where everyone gets together and learns something n ew or applies the knowledge that they have to make something. It may not be something physical, however. Here it is something physical. It’s furnit ure made out of wood.  

Shawna says, “Yeah, this is what I’m working on rig ht now. I’m building a dining table and chairs.” A “dining (dining) table” is a t able that you would put in a large room in your house, and you would eat at that table . It’s the table you would use for eating. “To dine” (dine) means to eat. Shawna i s working on a dining table and chairs.  

Hugo says, “The grain is beautiful on this piece of  hardwood.” “Grain” (grain), when we’re talking about wood, refers to the lines and the patterns on the surface of a piece of wood. If you look at a piece of wood that has been cut from a tree, you will see that there are lines in the wo od. These lines are called the “grain” of the wood.  

“Hardwood” is a special kind of wood that is very h eavy, that is typically used for making houses, for example, or constructing things that you need to be very solid, to be very stable. We use hardwood very comm only in houses for the floors of the house. My house, for example, has “hardwood flooring,” meaning there are pieces of wood that you walk on. Now of course most  floors are made of some kind of wood. “Hardwood” is a special kind of wood that is, well, very hard.  

Hugo says, “It certainly looks better than the plyw ood furniture I have in my house.” “Plywood” (plywood) is a cheap – that is to  say, inexpensive – board that is made from a flat piece of wood. Usually it’s use d by gluing different wood materials together. Plywood is not very strong. It’ s not very hard. It’s used often in order to save money because it’s inexpensive.  

It was very popular in the 1960s and ’70s for peopl e to put plywood on the walls of their rooms inside of their houses so you wouldn ’t be painting your walls – you would have this wood. In my house where I grew up, in the basement (in the bottom part of the house) we had plywood on the wal ls. That was very popular in the 1970s. It’s not as popular anymore today.  

Hugo says his furniture is made from this cheap woo d. Then he asks, “What is all this?” He’s obviously looking at or pointing to som ething. Shawna says, “Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and drills.” “Tool s” are instruments you use in order to make something. A “saw” (saw) is a tool th at is used to cut wood. It has little sharp points on it – what we call “teeth,” j ust like the teeth in your mouth.  

A “chisel” (chisel) is a long tool that has a sharp  end on it. Usually it’s made of metal. We use a chisel to remove small sections of the wood. A sculptor, such as Michelangelo, uses a chisel in order to remove piec es of marble or stone in order to make the sculpture. Here, we’re talking about a wood chisel, not a chisel used with a very hard rock such as marble.  

A “drill” (drill) is a tool that puts a hole into s omething – in this case, into a piece of wood. The verb “to drill” can mean to put a hole  into something like wood. It can also mean to practice something over and over a gain. If you play basketball, or any sport, your coach probably has you do certai n “drills” – certain exercises – over and over again. We also use this verb sometime s in school when we give  

students things to practice over and over again, of ten used with things that teachers want students to memorize. 

Hugo then asks Shawna, “And what is all this metal for?” “Metal” (metal) is something like steel, iron, silver, gold, copper, b rass – all of these are examples of metals. Shawna then explains, “I’m adding some g rillwork for the back of the chairs.” “Grillwork” (grillwork) here refers to met al bars or wires that cross each other in order to make a flat surface. So, the back  of the chair is actually going to have this grillwork on it. The grillwork will be us ed basically as the back of the chair.  

A chair has three parts. It has a seat, where you s it on – where you put your behind on, or your “butt,” we would say informally,  on. It has legs that are on the ground, or that are placed on the ground, and it ha s a back, typically, where you can lean back on. You can put the back of your body  on the back of the chair. This chair is going to have grillwork made of metal  on it, which doesn’t sound very comfortable to me, but it’s not my chair.  

Shawna says, “I usually don’t do metalwork” – that is, she usually doesn’t work with metal. Hugo says, “This doesn’t look simple.” It does not look simple. “These pieces have been welded together, and is that used for soldering?” Hugo is looking at the metal grillwork and saying that diff erent pieces appear to have been “welded (welded) together.”  

“To weld” means to join two pieces of metal by maki ng them very hot, so that they are able to be connected so that when they are  cool, they are then permanently connected. “Solder” (solder) – the “L” is silent – is a material that you use to connect two pieces of metal together tha t might be difficult to connect directly using welding. Solder is a soft material t hat you heat up, and when you heat it up, it melts, and then when it cools down, it stays solid, and that’s how you connect the two pieces of metal.  

Shawna says, “You got it,” meaning that’s correct. “When all is said and done, I’ll have a new dining room set with a large table and e ight chairs.” “When all is said and done” means eventually – in the end. This expre ssion is often used when we are trying to give a summary, say, of a story, or w hen we are trying to tell someone the final result of something without givin g them all the details.  

Hugo says, “Wow, I’m impressed.” “To be impressed” means that you really think it’s wonderful. You are really surprised at somethi ng in a good way. Shawna says, “Want to try your hand at it?” “To try your h and at” something means to try  

to do something for the first time, especially if i t is difficult and if you don’t have very much experience doing it.  

Hugo says, “No, thanks. You see these 10 fingers? I ’m rather fond of them.” “To say you are fond (fond) of” something means you lik e something. You think something is good and interesting. It’s an expressi on that you still hear in conversational English, although it isn’t as common  now perhaps as it was 50 years ago.  

Hugo says he’s “rather fond of” his fingers. “Rathe r” here means “very.” Why does he say this? Well, because he is saying that i f he tries to do what Shawna does, he may cut off one of his fingers, and becaus e he’s “fond of his fingers” – that is, he likes his fingers – he doesn’t want to try his hand at woodworking or at metalwork.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
