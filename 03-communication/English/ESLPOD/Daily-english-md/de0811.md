[start of dialogue] 

Lew:  Boo!! Boo!! Your team sucks! 

Alexa:  Sit down and stop heckling the visiting tea m. You’re making a fool of yourself. 

Lew:  I’m supporting our team. If I keep taunting t he players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we’ll gain an  advantage. 

Alexa:  If you keep this up, we’ll get kicked out o f this stadium. 

Lew:  We won’t get kicked out. Get into the spirit of the game and start yelling at the other team with me. Hey, it’s working! Look at that pathetic attempt to score. You guys are a bunch of babies! 

Alexa:  Stop that! Look, security is coming this wa y. 

Lew:  They just want to catch a glimpse of the pers on who has the guts to stand up for our team. Whoo! Whoo! 

Alexa:  If anyone asks, I don’t know you.

Lew begins our dialogue by saying, “Boo!! Boo!! You r team sucks!” Lew is at a sports game and he’s yelling at the other team. Thi s is something of course that some sports fans like to do. When they go to a game , they like to yell at the opposing or opposite team, the team that is not you r team. “Boo” is a word that we yell loudly when we want to show our disapproval  or dislike of some sports team. It could also be in some other sort of perfor mance. It could even be in a musical or theatrical performance, in a theater. Le w says, “Your team sucks.” This verb to “suck” is a rather rude, informal word  meaning to be very bad at something or to be terrible. It's a very negative w ay of describing someone. If you say “This sucks!”, you mean this is terrible. This is awful. It's a pretty strong word, not a vulgar word, but certainly one that you would n’t want to use in a business meeting. 

Alexa says, “Sit down and stop heckling the visitin g team. You're making a fool of yourself.” Alexa is telling Lew to sit down and to stop heckling. To “heckle” (heckle) means to make rude comments, unkind commen ts interrupting someone when they're speaking or when they're performing, s o if you are going to a performance of a comedian and the comedian is telli ng jokes and you don’t like the comedian, you may yell things back at him or he r, insulting him or her. That would be heckling. Well, that’s what Lew is doing. He’s heckling the visiting team, the sports team that has come from somewhere else t o play where your sports team normally plays. Alexa says that Lew is making a fool of himself. To “make a fool of yourself” is to do something that makes you  look stupid, that other people look at and laugh at. 

Lew says, “I'm supporting our team (I'm trying to h elp our team). If I keep taunting the players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we'll gain an advantage.” To “taunt” (taunt) means to say somethi ng that is mean, something that is rude, trying to get someone to react to you , trying to get you to get mad. We might also use the verb to “tease” (tease). Well , Lew thinks that he’s taunting the players on the other team, the visiting team, s o that if he does, they will lose their concentration. Your concentration is your abi lity to focus, to think about only one thing and ignore all the other things. To “lose  your concentration” means to not be able to do that. Lew thinks that his tauntin g will give his team an advantage, that they’ll gain an advantage. To “gain  an advantage” is to do something that will give you a better position or b etter situation, so that you are more likely to, in this case, win. 

Alexa says, “If you keep this up, we'll get kicked out of this stadium.” To “keep something up” or to “keep up something” here means to continue to do something, especially something that is difficult o r challenging. “To keep up” can also have other meanings in English and those can b e found in our Learning  

Guide. Alexa says to Lew that if he keeps up his he ckling, they will get kicked out of the stadium. To “get kicked out” means forced to  leave a place even though you want to stay there, so if you go to a restauran t and you start yelling at people and screaming and swearing, the owner will probably  kick you out. He will say, “Hey, you get out of here! You can't stay here.” Th at’s to be kicked out. Sometimes bars, places that serve alcohol, have spe cial people that will kick you out, that will remove you physically if you cause p roblems. They're called “bouncers”. Well, Alexa is afraid they will get kic ked out of the “stadium” (stadium). 

A stadium could also be called an “arena” (arena). Basically, it's a large building usually without a roof on the top that has a lot of  seats, around often in a circle, could be in a square, but usually in a circular for mation that is watching some sort of sports game in the middle of the stadium. Y ou could have a baseball stadium. You could have a football stadium. Many ci ties have separate stadiums for football and baseball. Some just have one. Some  stadiums are also used for rock concerts because often you can put 20,000 or 5 0,000, sometimes as many as 100,000 or 150,000 in a single stadium. I believ e the Los Angeles Coliseum can hold about 110,000 people. The Coliseum is an e xample of a stadium. 

Lew says, “We won't get kicked out. Get into the sp irit of the game,” he tells her “and start yelling at the other team with me.” To “ get into the spirit of something” means to do what other people are doing, to have th e same excitement and enthusiasm as they have. To “yell” (yell) means to shout, to speak in a very loud voice. Lew says, “Hey, it's working” meaning he’s h eckling is working. “Look at that pathetic attempt to score.” “Pathetic” (pathet ic) here means very sad or miserable, terrible. To “score” means to earn a poi nt in a game. In baseball, you can score if you hit the ball out of the ballpark, what's called the homerun. In American football, you score when you take the ball , one of your players and you run across what's called the goal line. Lew again y elling at the other team says, “You guys are a bunch of babies! 

Alexa says, “Stop that! Look, security is coming th is way.” Alexa is telling Lew that the security officers, the people whose job it  is to keep the stadium safe and secure and to be not crazy. They're coming this way . They're coming toward Alexa and Lew. 

Lew says, “They just want to catch a glimpse of the  person who has the guts to stand up for our team.” The phrase to catch a “glim pse” (glimpse) means to see something for a very brief moment, very quickly. In  this case, Lew is saying that the security guards want to come over and see him b ecause he has the guts to stand up for his team. “Guts” (guts) here means cou rage, bravery, the willingness  

to do something difficult when it is a perhaps scar y or frightening situation. To “stand up for something” means to defend or protect  someone who is perhaps being attacked or in a difficult place or situation . Well, of course, we don’t think Lew is correct. The security guards are probably no t interested in catching a glimpse of him because he has guts. 

Alexa says, “If anyone asks, I don’t know you.” She ’s saying she doesn’t want to be associated with Lew. Lew’s probably had a little  bit too much beer during the game. That happens in American stadiums. Sometimes people drink a little too much and then they start yelling. Of course, if you ’ve watched the soccer match in some countries, you know exactly what I'm talkin g about. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
