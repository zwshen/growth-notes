# Writing a Postcard

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 347: Writing a Postcard.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 347.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California – the home of Hollywood; the home of Dr. Lucy Tse!  On this episode, we’re going to listen to someone writing a postcard to a friend, and receiving a postcard.  We’ll discuss some typical vocabulary you might use when you are sending someone a postcard.  Let’s get started.  > I was on vacation in Yosemite and I decided to send a postcard to my friend, Elaine, who was on her own vacation in Europe.    Dear Elaine,  I arrived safely two days ago and I’m having the time of my life.  I met some nice people here and we’ve been keeping each other company.  The weather has been ideal and we’re off on another hike tomorrow.  This is the life.    Wish you were here.  I hope you’re having as good a time as I am.    See you soon!  Vivian  On the day I sent my postcard to Elaine, I got one from her.  She wrote:  Dear Vivian,  I’ve had a nightmare of a trip.  Our flight was delayed and we missed our connection to Oslo.  I’ve been here three days and it has poured the entire time.  There’s nothing to do but sit in the hotel.  What a dump!  It looks nothing like the pictures and it’s not at all what I expected.  I even got food poisoning the first day I was here!  I hope your trip wasn’t a washout like mine.  I can’t wait to get home!
