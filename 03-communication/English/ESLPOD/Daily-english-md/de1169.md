This episode is about someone who talk too much, an d someone who doesn’t talk enough. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.

Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?

Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft- spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No on e could get a word in edgewise with her.

Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than tryin g to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.

Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.

Artem: Ooh, that’s a little harsh.

Marcia: Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the bl athering, gossipy type.

Artem: I wonder . . .

Marcia: What?

 Artem: I wonder what they’re saying about us.

[end of dialogue]

Marcia begins by saying, “Phew! I thought they’d ne ver leave,” meaning they stayed a very long time. Marcia is referring to two  guests that they had over, two women from work, I think. Artem says, “I enjoyed th eir company, didn’t you?” “Company” (company) here means something different than you may expect. “Company” means the time that you spend with other people. That’s what it means here – the presence of another person.

If someone says, “I’m very bad company,” he means I ’m not a good person to be with; I’m not a good person to spend time with. It’ s a very different meaning than the one you may be thinking of normally, which woul d refer to a business. But here, “company” means the presence of another perso n. Marcia says, “Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the  shy side.” So, there were two women who were visiting them. One of them is Jessie .

Marcia thinks Jessie is “fine,” meaning okay. She d escribes her as being “a little reserved” (reserved). “To be reserved” means to be quiet, not to talk a lot, but also not to share your opinions – not to tell other  people what you are thinking or feeling. Jessie is also described as being “soft (s oft) – spoken (spoken).” A person who is “soft-spoken” doesn’t speak very loud ly. Sometimes it’s hard to hear what they’re saying. I have never been called “soft-spoken.” I wonder why.

Jessie is soft-spoken and “on the shy (shy) side.” “To be shy” means to be perhaps uncomfortable being around other people or talking to other people. We might use the adjective “timid” (timid) to describe  a person who is shy. “On the shy side” (side) means that she’s a little bit shy,  maybe not all that much. Marcia describes the other woman, Kelly, as being someone who “talked our ear off.”

She says, “Kelly, on the other hand” – meaning in c omparison to, or in addition to – “talked our ear off.” “To talk someone’s ear off”  means to talk a lot, to talk too much. “No one could get a word in edgewise with her ,” Marcia says. “To get a word in edgewise” (edgewise) means that you are alm ost unable to talk because the other person is talking so much. “To get a word  in edgewise” would mean to give your opinion, or simply to say something, to s omeone who is talking so much, it’s very difficult to get a chance to talk.

Artem, however, says that he thinks Kelly’s anecdot es were funny. An “anecdote” (anecdote) is a funny, or humorous, story about som ething that really happened.

It’s not the same as a joke. A “joke” is often some thing that is imaginary, that never took place. An anecdote is a story that is fu nny but that did take place. Artem describes Kelly as being “a little long-winde d.” A person who is a “long (long) – winded (winded)” is a person who talks too  much, who talks too long, so long that you begin to get a little bored by the pe rson.

Artem says, “I enjoyed talking to her,” meaning Kel ly, “more than trying to make conversation with Jessie” (the other woman). “To ma ke conversation” with someone is to try to talk to a person. Americans, i n some parts of the country, often make conversation with strangers – people who m they’ve never met before.

That doesn’t happen very often in Los Angeles or Ne w York. In fact, if you try to make conversation with someone – say, at a grocery store or waiting for a bus – the person might think you’re a little weird, might  even try to get away from you because that’s not what people do in big cities in the U.S., but in smaller towns and in certain areas in the United States, it’s ver y common for people “to make conversation,” even with people they don’t know ver y well.

Artem had difficulty making conversation with Jessi e. That’s because, in Artem’s words, “she is so closemouthed and guarded that it”  – making conversation – “was like pulling teeth.” “To be closemouthed” mean s to not be willing to speak. It’s similar to being shy. But it refers specifical ly to someone who doesn’t like talking.

“To be guarded” (guarded) means that you are carefu l and cautious, usually because you don’t want to tell someone something yo u don’t want them to know, a secret. Someone who is very guarded is someone wh o doesn’t tell you what he’s thinking, perhaps because he doesn’t want to t ell you something that he thinks is a secret or wants to keep a secret. That’ s why Artem found talking to Jessie “like pulling teeth.” This is a common expre ssion, “like pulling (pulling) teeth.”

Something that is “like pulling teeth” is something  that is very difficult to do, something that is very challenging, often because t he other person doesn’t cooperate. The other person you’re trying to do thi s with doesn’t do what you want them to do, especially when it comes to talkin g. “Getting an answer from our lawyer that we could actually understand was li ke pulling teeth.” Our lawyer was always using these long words, these legal term s we didn’t understand. Or, “Trying to get my brother to answer a question is l ike pulling teeth.” It’s very difficult.

Marcia says, “I’d rather talk to someone who is a l ittle reticent than a loudmouth.” “To be reticent” (reticent) means to be unwilling t o share your opinion, to be unwilling to talk about a certain topic – perhaps b ecause you don’t want to, perhaps because you don’t think the other person ne eds to know.

A “loudmouth” (loudmouth) – one word – is, as you m ight guess, a person who always talks very loudly and often too much, someon e who perhaps tries to impress other people by bragging, by saying how goo d he is. A loudmouth is, in general, a person who we consider somewhat “obnoxio us” – that is, not a very likeable person. Marcia prefers to talk to someone who is a little reticent than someone who’s a loudmouth.

Artem says, “Ooh, that’s a little harsh.” “To be ha rsh” (harsh) means to be a little mean, a little cruel, too unkind. Marcia says, “May be you’re right, but I don’t like the blathering, gossipy type.” “To blather” (blathe r) means to use a lot of words but not really to say anything. Someone who “blathe rs” is someone who maybe doesn’t know what they want to say but keeps talkin g anyway, or isn’t very intelligent and therefore simply talks without real ly thinking about it before he opens his mouth. So, “blathering” would be a person  who is like that, who blathers.

“Gossipy” (gossipy) refers to someone who enjoys ta lking about other people and mentioning things that may or may not be true. “Gos sip” is something that people talk about, often things that are bad about the oth er person that may be true or may not be true. Many magazines and newspapers publ ish gossip – things that may be true, but they may not, too. Another word for these things is “rumors” (rumors) – information that people tell other peopl e even though they aren’t sure that the information is correct.

Marcia doesn’t like the “blathering, gossipy type,”  meaning that kind of person. Artem says, “I wonder . . .” Marcia says, “What?” “ I wonder what they’re saying about us.” Artem is wondering what their friends Je ssie and Kelly might be saying about Artem and Marcia. The answer is probably noth ing. People often think that other people are more interested in their lives tha n they really are, and we’re guessing their friends from work aren’t really all that interested in Marcia, Artem, and their particular relationship.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.

 Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?

Artem: I wonder . . .

There’s nothing blathering about our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. She always knows what she’s saying and how to say it.
