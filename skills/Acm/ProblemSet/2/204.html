<P>
The DoD company has contracted to determine under what conditions a pair
of scanner robots can collide. The
robots are fired simultaneously from ``guns&quot; that are mounted near opposite
ends of a horizontal strip.  They travel in
straight lines until they hit a wall of the strip or until they are in the
same spot at the approximately the same time.
<P>
<center><img src=204img3.gif></center>
<P>
Whenever a robot hits a wall, it bounces off without loss of speed and in
a straight line so that the angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection.
<P>
<center><img src=204img4.gif></center>
<P>
If the robots are in the same spot at approximately the same time, then
they ``collide.&quot;
<P>
<P>
Write a program to determine
whether robots collide and if so where.  To simplify the computer model of
the physical problem, assume the following.

<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG>1)</STRONG>
<DD>  The horizontal strip is 2-dimensional, and it runs left-to-right. Its
    walls are straight lines.
<DT><STRONG>2)</STRONG>
<DD>  Each robot is a point mass. That is, the circumference of each robot is 0.
<DT><STRONG>3)</STRONG>
<DD>  A robot maintains the speed with which it was originally fired until it
    collides with the other robot or until it
    passes the gun from which the other robot was fired.
<DT><STRONG>4)</STRONG>
<DD>  There are 2 guns, one mounted to the left of the other on a horizontal strip.
    The initial angle of the left gun
    is between -85 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  >  and 85 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  > . The initial angle of the right gun is between
    95 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  >  and 180 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  >  or -95 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  >  and -180 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="204img1.gif"  > . (All
    angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive <I>x</I>-axis.)

    each other.

<P>
Input for your program is a text file which contains data for several
different pairs of robots.  The lines of the text
file come in pairs.  The first line of a pair gives initial firing information
about the robot fired from the leftmost gun.
The second line of the pair gives initial firing information about the robot
fired from the rightmost gun.  Each line
contains 4 data items as follows:
<P>
<I>x</I>-coordinate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>y</I>-coordinate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angle in degrees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed (reals)
<P>
The end of input is indicated by end-of-file.  Assume that the input is
error-free.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output
<font size=3>(To help maintain floating point accuracy when converting degrees to
radians, use the predeclared constant <TT>pi</TT>).</font></A></FONT></H2>
<P>
For each robot problem, output from your program should consist of the number
of the problem (ex: <TT>Robot Problem #1</TT>, <TT>Robot Problem #2</TT>),
and a statement indicating whether or not the robots do collide. If they do
collide, your
program should also print the coordinates of the point of collision.
If there are multiple collisions, only print the first one.
If there are multiple collisions at the same time, only print the one with
smallest x-coordinate.
All real output should be printed with 2 digits to the right of the decimal.
<br>
Print a blank line after each robot problem.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: Assume that a=b only if |a-b| < &epsilon; = 10<sup>-7</sup>
