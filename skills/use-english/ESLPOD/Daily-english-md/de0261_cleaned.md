This episode is called “Describing People’s Personalities.”  It's going to be a dialogue between two people talking about the personality of their children, as well as themselves.  Let's get started.  > Joann:  Oh, are those pictures of your kids?  Artem:  Yes.  These are my three daughters and these are my two sons.    Joann:  Your sons look so alike.  Are they similar in personality, too?    Artem:  It’s funny you ask that.  My wife and I are always saying how different they are from one another, even though they’re the closest in age.  Sergey, the younger one, is moody and a little timid, while his older brother, Dennis, is talkative and cheerful all the time.    Joann:  That’s really interesting.  You know, I have an older sister and we’re only a year apart, but we have very different personalities, too.  When I was little, I was bad-tempered and I always fought with my brothers and sisters, while my sister was a little angel.  She was always patient and generous.  I really looked up to her.    Artem:  It’s hard for me to believe that you were ever bad-tempered.  You’re so even-keeled now.  Me, on the other hand, I was a selfish and stubborn kid.  I’m surprised that my parents put up with me.    Joann:  I’m sure you’re exaggerating.  All kids are a little selfish and stubborn, I think.  Good thing most of us grow out of it as we get older.
