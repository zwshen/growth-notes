This episode is a dialogue between Margaret and Ton y about different forms, or types, of government. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Margaret: Okay, the teacher said that we should set  up an ideal form of government for our imaginary country and then work out detailed plans for governance.

Tony: I think the simplest is a dictatorship. I’ll make all of the decisions.

Margaret: You’re sounding like a fascist. This is s upposed to be a partnership, remember?

Tony: Okay then, let’s make it a monarchy. I can be  king and you can be queen.

Margaret: You’ll probably still make all of the dec isions as king. Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rul e equally.

Tony: That’s fine with me, but you’re the communist , or at least socialist. Don’t you think an oligarchy would be too elitist? I woul d think you would prefer a meritocracy of some sort.

Margaret: This isn’t about my personal politics. It ’s about what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?

Tony: There’s nothing simple about a democracy. How  about no government at all?

Margaret: You mean anarchy?

 Tony: Sure, that would be the simplest.

Margaret: Why do I get the feeling that you’re maki ng suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, rather th an political considerations?

Tony: That’s because you’re very perceptive. I have  a big weekend planned!

Margaret begins our dialogue by saying, “Okay, the teacher said that we should set up an ideal form of government.” “To set up” is  a two-word phrasal verb meaning to establish or start. Margaret and Tony are in a class in which the teacher has instructed the students or told the stu dents to imagine that they are starting a form of government, an “ideal” (ideal) o r perfect form of government. A “form of government” is the way that a country or s ome region within a country organizes itself – how it makes laws and enforces t hem or puts them into effect.

Margaret says that this ideal form of government is  “for our imaginary” – or a made-up – “country.” The teacher also told the stud ents to “work out detailed plans for governance.” “To work out” means to figur e out, to think about, to plan. “Governance” (governance) refers to leadership and control over a group of people. Tony says, “I think the simplest is a dicta torship.” The “simplest” would be the one that is least complicated.

Tony is saying that the simplest form of government  would be a “dictatorship” (dictatorship). A dictatorship is a system of gover nment in which one person is in control and has complete authority over the governm ent. A dictatorship is run by a “dictator,” a person who has absolute and complet e control of the laws and the government in a country. Tony says that he’s going to be the dictator in this imaginary government. He says, “I’ll make all of the decisions.”

Margaret says, “You’re sounding like a fascist.” A “fascist” (fascist) is a person who supports a dictatorship where the nation, and/o r a given race, is considered more important than the individuals. Now, “fascism”  has a particular historical context that we’re not going to talk about here. Pe ople nowadays use this expression not to refer necessarily to, say, the go vernment of Germany or Italy in the 1930s, but rather to someone who is basically a n “authoritarian,” or who believes that the government should be able to do a nything it wants. That’s a more general use of the term in English.

Margaret says, “This is supposed to be a partnershi p, remember?” A “partnership” is when two people work together for some particular purpose. Although nowadays, people talk about “partners” (pa rtners) to refer not just to people with whom they have a partnership, but also for people who they might be in a romantic relationship with. I never quite unde rstood this. I mean, if someone’s your “partner,” either he or she is your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. I mean, really, there aren’t any o ther choices. Are there? But for some reason, nowadays people prefer to say “partner .” I guess they want it to be a mystery, to keep you guessing, perhaps.

Anyway, Tony says, “Okay, let’s make it a monarchy. ” Tony proposes making this imaginary government a “monarchy” (monarchy). A monarchy is a form of government that is led by a monarch – a king or a q ueen. There are various countries throughout the world that still have mona rchies. The government of the United Kingdom – of Great Britain – is a monarchy, officially. The head of the government is the queen of England, Queen Elizabeth  II (at least at the time of this recording).

There are various other monarchies throughout the w orld as well, and many countries that used to have a monarch but no longer  do, such as France. Tony says, “I can be king and you can be queen.” Margare t says, “You’ll probably still make all of the decisions as king.” Margaret doesn’ t really like this idea. She says, “Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rule equally.” An “oligarchy” (oligarchy) is a form of g overnment led by a small group of people who don’t listen to anyone else. They dec ide how the government should be run.

The verb “to rule” (rule) means, in this case, to h ave and use power as a government. It’s often used in connection with a di ctatorship, a monarchy, and other forms of government that are not democratic, although really, it could refer to any kind of government – the functioning of any kind of government. Tony says, “That’s fine with me,” meaning that’s okay wi th me; I agree. “But you’re the communist, or at least socialist.”

Tony refers to Margaret as a “communist” (communist ). A communist is a person who supports a form of government in which everythi ng is owned by the state, basically, and people are paid based on their needs  with the assumption that everyone will contribute as much as he or she can. Of course, communism has different forms, and the real definition is a littl e more complicated than that, but you probably are familiar with communist government s such as the one that used to be in charge of the Soviet Union or the one that  is currently in charge of China.

Tony says that Margaret is a “communist, or at leas t socialist.” A “socialist” (socialist) is a little more difficult to define. A  socialist is a person who believes the government should have a very strong role in ow ning different parts of an economy and that the government should have a very active role in providing for the needs of the people. However, once again, peopl e will differ on the exact definition of what a socialist is.

In some countries, such as the United States, the w ord “socialist,” and certainly the word “communist,” is meant as an insult. It’s n ot something that most politicians would want to say or admit to, although  there is actually a senator from one of our states who is a socialist, but that’s qu ite unusual in terms of American politics.

Tony continues, “Don’t you think an oligarchy would  be too elitist?” “Elitist” (elitist) refers to the idea that one thinks one is better th an everyone else. You think that you are superior, that you and perhaps a small grou p of people know more or are better than the people around you.

Tony says, “I would think you would prefer a merito cracy of some sort.” The word “meritocracy” (meritocracy) refers to a system of g overnment or to a system in general in which people are given power based on th eir qualifications – the most talented, the most able people are given more power . A meritocracy isn’t necessarily a democracy. A meritocracy could be a s ystem of government where someone decides who is the most talented and gives people power based on that decision. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the  people in general decide who is the best to lead the government.

Margaret says, however, “This isn’t about my person al politics.” Your “personal politics” are your own belief systems, your own des ires, your own ways of interacting with other people. She says, “It’s abou t what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?” “Democracy” (democracy) is a system of government in which people vote for the leaders of that government, and in some cases vote directly on laws that will be used by the government. It’s a government by the people.

The United States has a representative form of demo cracy, where we vote on people who then vote on the laws for the country. I t’s not a direct democracy, if you will. We don’t usually vote on laws directly, a lthough there are places, such as here in California, where sometimes we do vote d irectly on a law, on what are called propositions or referendums – but in general , the U.S. has a representative form of democracy.

Tony continues, “There is nothing simple about a de mocracy. How about no government at all?” Margaret says, “You mean anarch y?” “Anarchy” (anarchy) is a situation where there is in fact no government or  no one who is in charge, no one who has authority. It’s generally considered a state of disorder, a situation where there is no government and things often are r ather dangerous. Tony says, “Sure, that would be the simplest.”

Margaret says, “Why do I get the feeling that you’r e making suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, ra ther than political considerations?” Margaret is saying that Tony seems  to be picking the forms of government that are easiest to write about for this  school assignment, not that are best for their imaginary government or imaginar y country.

Tony says, “That’s because you’re very perceptive.”  “To be perceptive” (perceptive) means to be able to understand things that most people aren’t aware of or don’t understand. Tony is telling Marga ret that she’s very perceptive – that the forms of government he is suggesting are  the easiest ones to write about for the school assignment.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
