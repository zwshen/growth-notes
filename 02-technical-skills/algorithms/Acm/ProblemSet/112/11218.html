<h1>Problem K</h1>
<h2>KTV</h2>
</center>

<p>One song is extremely popular recently, so you and your friends decided to sing it in KTV. 
The song has 3 characters, so exactly 3 people should sing together each time (yes, there are 3 microphones in the room). 
There are exactly 9 people, so you decided that each person sings exactly once. In other words, all the people are divided into 
3 disjoint groups, so that every person is in exactly one group.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="p11218.png" /></p>

<p>However, some people don't want to sing with some other people, and some combinations perform worse than others combinations. 
Given a score for every possible combination of 3 people, what is the largest possible score for all the 3 groups?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 1000 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single integer <i>n</i> (0 < <i>n</i> < 81), 
the number of possible combinations. The next <i>n</i> lines each contains 4 positive integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>s</i> 
(1 <= <i>a</i> < <i>b</i> < <i>c</i> <= 9, 0 < <i>s</i> < 10000), that means a score of <i>s</i> is given to the combination (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>). 
The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number and the largest score. If it is impossible, print -1.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>

3
1 2 3 1
4 5 6 2
7 8 9 3

1 2 3 1
1 4 5 2
1 6 7 3

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>

Case 1: 6
Case 2: -1
