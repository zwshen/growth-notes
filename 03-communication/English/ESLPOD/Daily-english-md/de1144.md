In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Victor and Maura about someone who is assertive, someone who gives h is or her opinion with great confidence, and someone who is meek – someone  who is not very strong or perhaps likes to keep quiet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: We need to take the bull by the horns. In the meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more hemming and ha wing.

Maura: You’re right. We need to tell them what we r eally think and be done with it.

Victor: Definitely. We’ve been conciliatory long en ough. Today, we need to be insistent without being too pushy.

Maura: Being unassuming and deferential has its pla ce, but not if we seem meek. We need to be assertive without being too in- your-face.

Victor: You’re absolutely right. One of us has to s peak up.

Maura: Yes, one of us has to be bold. They’ll have to take us seriously this time.

Victor: Okay, ready?

Maura: Sure, I have your back.

Victor: Huh? I thought you were going to do the tal king.

 Maura: Uh, I thought you were.

Victor: Maybe we should wait for the next meeting to take them on.

Maura: I totally agree. It’ll give us a little time  to work up to it.

Victor: Exactly!

[end of dialogue]

Victor begins our dialogue by saying, “We need to t ake the bull by the horns.” “To take the bull (bull) by the horns (horns)” means to  deal directly with something that is very difficult without hesitating, without delaying – to do it right now. A “bull” is an animal, a male animal whose opposite is the “cow,” the female animal of that particular kind of animal. A bull has “horn s” – things that stick out of its head. Bulls are known, at least in the popular imag ination, of being very difficult to control, of being dangerous. So, to take a bull by its horns would be a very dangerous thing to do. You could get hurt.

This expression, then, “to take the bull by the hor ns” means to try to take care of something that is very difficult or challenging. Vi ctor says, “In the meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more he mming and hawing.” The expression “to give it to someone straight” means to tell someone the truth in a very simple and direct way. We might say in a “stra ightforward” way. “I’m going to give it to you straight.” I’m going to tell you the  truth even though it might hurt you, even though it might be difficult for you to a ccept.

The expression “hemming (hemming) and hawing (hawin g)” is a somewhat unusual one. “To hem and haw” means to speak indire ctly. It’s the opposite, in a way, of giving it to someone straight. “To hem and haw” is to speak very indirectly or, I think more commonly, not to make a  decision – to go back and forth, to keep talking about something without actu ally coming to a decision. Someone who doesn’t want to make a decision or want s more time to make a decision might hem and haw.

Well, Victor is saying that they’re not going to he m and haw. They’re going to “give it to them straight,” whoever they are. Maura  says, “You’re right,” meaning you’re correct. “We need to tell them what we reall y think and be done with it.” The expression “to be done with it” means to finish  something and leave nothing undone, to make sure that you’ve completely finishe d whatever it is that you’re doing.

 Often we use this expression when the thing to be d one is perhaps somewhat painful, or something you don’t really want to do. If you’re going to break up with your girlfriend or your boyfriend, some people say it’s better just to tell them directly and “be done with it.” Don’t wait or give hints over a period of weeks that maybe you’re not happy in your relationship and so forth. Some people would say, “Just do it and be done with it.”

Victor agrees with Maura. He says, “Definitely. We’ ve been conciliatory long enough.” “To be conciliatory” (conciliatory) means to try to find a peaceful resolution to a problem, especially when one or bot h people who disagree about something are angry or upset. “To be conciliatory” means to try to end a conflict or a disagreement in such a way that the other pers on or the other group of people isn’t angry or upset. If you have a disagree ment with your wife or your husband, you might try to be conciliatory later on.  You might try to say nice things to them so that he or she is no longer angry. This isn’t always easy, of course. It depends what you said.

Victor says, “Today, we need to be insistent withou t being too pushy.” “To be insistent” (insistent) means to be demanding, to no t accept no for an answer. Someone who is insistent continues to try to win the argument or get what he wants. Someone who is “pushy” (pushy) is someone wh o is insistent but in a very forceful way, someone who tries to make other peopl e do what he wants. “Pushy” is always a negative way of describing some one. You can be insistent without being pushy. “To be pushy” means to go too far, to be too forceful.

Maura agrees. She says, “Being unassuming and defer ential has its place, but not if we seem meek.” “To be on unassuming” (unassu ming) means to be modest, not to want other people to pay attention to you, not to consider yourself the best person in the room, not to be arrogant. So meone who is unassuming is humble is modest. Maura says, “Being unassuming and  deferential has its place.”

“To be deferential” (deferential) means to be very respectful of people who are more powerful, or perhaps who are older, but so muc h so that you let them make all the decisions. “To be deferential” means usuall y to be too respectful of people, to let other people do everything or make all of the important decisions. I should add that being deferential isn’t always a bad thing , although it’s often used in a negative sense nowadays, perhaps because we all wan t to get our own way. No one wants to be deferential anymore.

Maura says, however, that being deferential “has it s place,” meaning sometimes it’s okay. “But,” she continues, “not if we seem me ek” (meek). “To be meek” here means to do what other people want you to do usuall y, to be humble. “To be meek,” however, can mean simply to be quiet and gen tle. It doesn’t have to be a bad thing, but Maura uses it here in a negative way , perhaps because we’re talking about something related to business, where people often think that being meek is the same as being “weak” (weak).

Maura says, “We need to be assertive without being too in-your-face.” “To be assertive” (assertive) means to be forceful and con fident, but still in a respectful way. “To be assertive” is not to be pushy. “To be a ssertive” means to show confidence to get what you want, to be someone who is willing to say what he wants and insist upon it.

Maura thinks they should be assertive without being  “too in-your-face.” “To be in- your-face” means to be confrontational, to be argum entative – to argue with someone, to directly challenge someone in order to win an argument or to get what you want. It’s similar to being pushy, but it refers specifically to someone who confronts another person – who argues with anot her person or says things to another person that would make him angry.

Victor agrees. He says, “You’re absolutely right. O ne of us has to speak up.” “To speak up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to giv e your opinion, especially when in the past you’ve been quiet. “To speak up” m eans to actually voice or tell someone what you’re thinking. Maura agrees. She say s, “Yes, one of us has to be bold.” “To be bold” (bold) here means to be dire ct, to be forceful, to be brave – not to be shy, not to be meek. She says, “They’ll h ave to take us seriously this time.”

Victor says, “Okay, ready?” Maura says, “Sure, I ha ve your back.” “To have someone’s back” (back) means to support someone who  is taking action. You’re not the person taking the action, but you’re helpin g that person. You’re supporting that person. Maura thinks that Victor is  going to be the one to speak up. Victor obviously thought Maura was going to be the one to speak up because he says, “Huh? I thought you were going to do the t alking,” meaning you were the one who was going to actually speak. Maura says , “I thought you were.”

Victor says, “Maybe we should wait for the next mee ting to take them on.” “To take someone on” means to start an argument or a di sagreement with someone, to confront someone. Maura says, “I totally agree,”  meaning “I completely agree.” “It’ll give us time to work up to it.” “To work up to” something is a phrasal verb meaning to slowly prepare for something so that you  are ready for it.

 So, after all this discussion about how they were g oing to give it to them straight, how they were going to be insistent, and so forth, it turns out that neither Maura nor Victor really wanted to be the one to speak up,  to do the talking. This of course is a common problem. People are very brave u ntil it comes to the point where they actually have to do something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
