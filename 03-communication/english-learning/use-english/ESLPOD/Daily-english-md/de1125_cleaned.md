This episode is a dialogue between Bethany and Nath an about giving someone something alcoholic to drink. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Bethany: Where is everybody? 

Nathan: While you were in the bathroom, the other g uys left.  

Bethany: In that case, I should go, too. It’s getti ng late. 

Nathan: The night is young. Let me get you a refill . 

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t have another drink.  I had a neat drink after dinner and I’m still feeling the effects. I’m a lightweigh t and I’m not normally a drinker.  

Nathan: What’s the harm? Have one for the road. I’l l serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon. It’s my specialty. I cou ld also mix you a cocktail, if you prefer. Consider it a nightcap. 

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t. 

Nathan: All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand. 

Bethany: No, it’s late, I’m tired, and I have to go . 

Nathan: Don’t rush off. You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for being a spoilsport, would you?  

 Bethany: I prefer that to the alternative! 

[end of dialogue] 

Bethany starts the dialogue by saying, “Where is ev erybody?” Nathan replies, “While you were in the bathroom, the other guys lef t” – the other people who were here. Remember that the word “guy” (guy) in Am erican English can mean a man – a male – but it can also just mean a group of  men and women, or boys and girls, I suppose. Bethany says, “In that case, I should go, too. It’s getting late.” Bethany is saying that she should go home be cause it is getting late and everyone else has left also.  

But Nathan doesn’t want her to go. He says, “The ni ght is young.” That expression “The night is young” is used when you do n’t want to go home after going to a party or doing something else. It’s used  to encourage someone else to stay out later with you, to perhaps go to a bar or go dancing. “The night is young” – that means it’s early in the evening. We wouldn’t  say this during the day, of course. It would have to be after, say, six o’clock  p.m. 

Bethany wants to go home, but Nathan wants her to s tay. He says, “Let me get you a refill.” The verb “to refill” (refill) means to put more liquid in someone’s glass – in this case, to serve someone another alco holic drink. The noun “refill” refers to that liquid which goes into your glass. B ethany says, “No, I really shouldn’t have another drink. I had a neat drink af ter dinner and I’m still feeling the effects.”  

This phrase or term “a neat (neat) drink” is one us ed mostly by what we would call “bartenders” – people who work behind a bar se rving you alcohol in a bar or a pub. A “neat drink” is a drink that is only made of one kind of alcohol. It’s not mixed with anything. It’s not mixed with water or j uice or ice or anything else. So, for example, if you wanted just whisky, you could g et the bartender to give you a small glass of whisky. If it were a “neat drink,” i t wouldn’t have any ice in it.  

Now, I don’t go to bars very much anymore, and to b e honest, I had never heard of this term “neat drink” before today. There’s a s imilar term that I think most Americans would be familiar with, which is “straigh t up.” A drink served “straight up” is also one in which there is no ice or other l iquids. However, the bartender makes the drink cold first by putting ice into it a nd then taking it out, basically. So, that’s the difference between a “neat drink” and a drink “straight up.”  

Bethany says she had a neat drink after dinner and she’s still “feeling the effects.” She says, “I’m a lightweight and I’m not normally a drinker.” If someone says they’re a “lightweight” (lightweight) – one wo rd – he means he can’t drink very much alcohol without it affecting him, that ev en a little bit of alcohol will make him a little dizzy or will get him, what we wo uld call, “drunk” (drunk), which is when you drink in so much alcohol you begin to l ose your ability to function normally.  

Bethany says she is a lightweight and “not normally  a drinker” – that is, a person who drinks a lot of alcohol, such as beer or wine o r whiskey or vodka or whatever one likes to drink. Nathan says, “What’s the harm?”  What bad could happen from doing it? He says, “Have one for the road.” The exp ression “one for the road” refers to one last drink before you leave. That’s n ot, of course, a very good idea – to be drinking if you are going to have to drive af terwards. I guess if you’re taking a taxi, it’s okay.  

Nathan wants to give Bethany “one for the road.” He  says, “I’ll serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon.” Remember, w e said “straight up” means that the drink has just one kind of alcohol, but is  made cold first by putting ice in it and then taking the ice out. I’m not quite sure why  you would have a drink straight up with a twist of lemon; if there were a twist of lemon, it wouldn’t be a drink straight up, I don’t think. But then again, I  don’t drink very much.  

Well, what is a “twist (twist) of lemon”? A twist o f lemon is a small amount of the fruit – lemon – that is squeezed into the drink. Of ten they will put the little piece of lemon – a little, what we would call, “slice” (slic e) of lemon – into the drink after it has been squeezed into the drink. Nathan says, “It’ s my specialty.” Your “specialty” is what you are very good at doing.  

He continues, “I could also mix you a cocktail if y ou prefer.” A “cocktail” (cocktail) is a drink that contains two or more ingredients. I t could be two different kinds of alcohol. It could be alcohol and water, or alcohol and juice, or alcohol and soda. “To mix” means to combine these two ingredients tog ether – the two kinds of alcohol or the two kinds of liquid that are in the drink.  

Nathan says, “Consider it a nightcap.” A “nightcap”  (nightcap) is an alcoholic drink that you drink right before going to bed to h elp you fall asleep. Bethany says, “No, I really shouldn’t.” This is a very poli te way of telling someone that you don’t want to do what that person wants you to do. Bethany doesn’t want to have another drink. Nathan keeps insisting. So Bethany s ays, “No, I really shouldn’t.”  

Nathan finally says, “All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand.” “To top off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to put more liquid into your glass of the same type when you haven’t finished drinking what’s alre ady in your glass. So, for example, if you have a cocktail of, I don’t know, w hiskey and soda. Someone says, “Let me top off your drink.” The person is of fering to put more whisky and soda into your glass until your glass is full again .  

Bethany however, says, “No, it’s late. I’m tired an d I have to go.” So, she’s very direct now with Nathan, telling Nathan no, she does n’t want to have another drink. But Nathan says, “Don’t rush off.” “To rush (rush) off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to leave suddenly or to leave in a hur ry, to leave quickly. Nathan says, “You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for be ing a spoilsport, would you? A “reputation” here refers to how other people percei ve you, what you are known for. You can have a good reputation or you can have  a bad reputation.  

A “spoilsport” (spoilsport) – one word – is a perso n who ruins other people’s fun, who behaves in a way that makes something less enjo yable than it should be. If you’re at a party and everyone wants to play a game  and you say, “Ah, no, I don’t want to play,” someone may call you a “spoilsport.”  You are spoiling or ruining the game or the situation for everyone else. Nathan  is telling Bethany that if she leaves now, she’ll get the reputation for being a s poilsport.  

Bethany, however, says, “I prefer that to the alter native.” An “alternative” (alternative) is another possibility, another optio n, another thing you can do if one thing doesn’t work or is not successful. Here what Bethany means is that she would rather have the reputation for being a spoils port than being the kind of person who keeps drinking as the night goes on – at  least, I think that’s what she means.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue]

Nathan: While you were in the bathroom, the other g uys left.  

Bethany: In that case, I should go, too. It’s getti ng late.
