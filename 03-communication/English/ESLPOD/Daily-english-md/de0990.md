In this episode, Rosa and Grant talk about being po pular. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rosa: Has the mail come yet?

Grant: We didn’t get any mail today.

Rosa: Damn it!

Grant: What’s the matter?

Rosa: I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party. I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the p arty of the season.

Grant: You’re worked up over a party?

Rosa: It’s not just any party. It’s the social even t of the year. Anyone who’s anybody will be there. If I don’t get an invitation , it means I’ve been snubbed. I’d never be able to live it down.

Grant: Who is Joanna anyway? She’s just another ric h girl, right?

Rosa: No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at  school and the leader of the in-crowd. If she so much as talks to you, you’re in . But if she gives you the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.

Grant: That’s ridiculous. She only has the power to  do that because you all worship her. One of these days, I hope somebody tak es her down a peg.

Rosa: But nobody would dare to go against Joanna. I t would be the end of their social life.

Grant: So what?

Rosa: So what?! I should know better than to talk a bout it with a clueless guy!

Rosa says to Grant, “Has the mail come yet?” Has the mail arrived? Grant says, “We didn’t get any mail today.” Rosa says, “Damn it !” “Damn (damn) it” is a vulgar expression that people use informally. It’s not something you should use. Typically, I never say this, or I only say that if I’m really angry. You would never want to say it in front of children, or your boss, or people you don’t know very well.

Grant says, “What’s the matter?” What is the proble m? Rosa says, “I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party . I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the party of the season. ” Rosa is waiting for an invitation – a card or a letter asking someone to d o something, usually to go somewhere for some formal event. This invitation is  for a birthday party for Joanna. Rosa heard that Joanna is having a “big bas h.” A “bash” (bash) is a large party, a large celebration with many people.

Rosa says, “It’s going to be the party of the seaso n,” meaning the most important party of this year or this time of year. Grant says , “You’re worked up over a party?” “To be worked up” means to be excited – pos sibly worried or anxious – about something. “To get worked up over” something is to get excited or worried or perhaps even angry about something. Rosa says, “ It’s not just any party. It’s the social event of the year.” Rosa is saying this is a very important party. It’s not just any party.

The “social event of the year” would be the most im portant social event, party, or celebration that people want to go to. Normally, we  associate this expression with people who are powerful – perhaps politically power ful or, more likely, economically powerful. People who have a lot of money are involved in these kinds of large social events: the presidents of com panies, and actors, and celebrities – at least if you live here in Los Ange les. In other places, such as Washington D.C., the social events are often politi cal, or at least are attended by people with political power.

Rosa says, “Anyone who’s anybody will be there.” Th at phrase, “anyone who’s anybody,” means everyone who is important – everyon e who is important in a certain social group. She says, “If I don’t get an invitation, it means I’ve been snubbed.” “To be snubbed” (snubbed) is to be treate d badly by another person, to be ignored by someone because that person doesn’ t think you’re important enough, perhaps. Rosa is worried about being snubbe d by not being invited to this social event of the year.

She says, “I’d never be able to live it down.” The expression “to live something down” means to survive an embarrassing and difficul t situation – to remain proud and confident even though something bad happened to  you, especially something embarrassing. If a teenage boy who’s good  at basketball plays a nine- year-old girl and is beaten by the nine-year-old gi rl, he might be embarrassed because he should have won. He may find it difficul t to live that down – to not be embarrassed in the future, especially around his fr iends.

Grant says, “Who is Joanna anyway?” Grant doesn’t e ven know who this Joanna is. “She’s just another rich girl, right?” Rosa say s, “No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at school and the leader of the in-cro wd.” Now we learn that Rosa is a young girl, probably in high school. She’s talkin g about “the most popular girl at school” – the girl that everyone admires, that ever ybody wants to be friends with.

“She is the leader” – she’s the most important pers on – “of the in-crowd.” When we talk about the “in-crowd,” we’re talking about the most popular students at a school. High school usually is a place where you ha ve very popular kids and kids like me who were not very popular, honestly. I was not in the in-crowd. I was not one of the most popular students in the school. Joa nna is in the in-crowd and is very popular at Rosa’s school.

Rosa says, “If she so much as talks to you, you’re in.” The expression “so much as” is used here to mean “even.” It’s a phrase used  to emphasize the minimum amount of something. “If you so much as look at me again, I’m going to punch you.” I’m going to hit you. Just looking at me, eve n that small thing, will make me want to punch you. I don’t know why. I think you’re  nice person. I really don’t want to punch you. It’s just an example.

Rosa says that if Joanna talks to you, you’re in. A ll she has to do is talk to you, and then people will consider you to be part of the  in-crowd, part of the popular group of students. Rosa says, “But if she gives you  the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.” “To give someone the cold shoulder”  means to ignore someone, to pay no attention to someone – not to be friendly  or kind to someone. If Joanna

gives you the cold shoulder, according to Rosa, you ’re out. “You’re out” is the opposite of “you’re in.” You’re not popular. “You’r e nobody,” Rosa says.

Grant says, “That’s ridiculous. She only has the po wer to do that because you all” – meaning you other students – “worship her.” “To w orship” (worship) here means just to give a lot of respect or admiration. Normally, we use this word in talking about God or some divine power. Here, we’re  using it just to mean admire, respect, look up to. Grant continues, “One of these days, I hope somebody takes her down a peg.” “One of these days”  is a phrase meaning someday, eventually. We use this to talk about some thing that might happen in the future, even though we don’t know when, specifi cally.

Grant hopes somebody takes Joanna down a peg. “To t ake someone down a peg” (peg) means to do something to make an arrogan t person less proud – “to humble” someone, we might say. “To take someone dow n a peg” is to take somebody who thinks they’re better than everyone el se and make them realize that they’re not.

Rosa says, “But nobody would dare go against Joanna .” “To dare” (dare) is to have the courage to do something that is very diffi cult or perhaps even dangerous. “To go against” someone is to disagree w ith another person or to oppose another person. “To dare to go against” some one would be to have the courage, then, to disagree or to oppose another per son.

Rosa says, “It would be the end of their social lif e.” Your “social life” is the time that you spend outside of work and school, enjoying  yourself. If you go against Joanna, Rosa is saying, you will no longer have a g ood social life. It will be the end of your social life. Grant says, “So what?” mea ning “Why is that important? Who cares?”

Rosa says, “So what?!” She can’t believe what Grant  is saying. “I should know better than to talk about it with a clueless guy.” “Clueless” (clueless) means to be unaware of something – to not understand something or not know very much about something. It’s used as an insulting term. If  you say someone is clueless, you mean they’re so stupid they don’t realize what is going on.

Rosa is calling Grant a “clueless guy.” Here, “guy”  (guy) is used to mean “boy” or “man” – probably “boy” here, since we’re talking ab out high school students. Rosa is calling Grant “clueless” because he doesn’t  understand the importance of being part of the in-crowd, apparently.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
