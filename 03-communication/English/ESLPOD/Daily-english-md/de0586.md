This episode is a dialogue between Grace and Yuji.  It’ s called “Getting a Girlfriend or Boyfriend Back,” meaning after you have se parated – broken up, split up, you no longer are boyfriend and girlfriend –  and then you want to get that person back into a relationship.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Grace:  What are you doing?

Yuji:  I’m working on a plan to get April back.

Grace:  I think that’s a lost cause.  You guys broke up thre e months ago.  There’s no way she’ll take you back.

Yuji:  Watch me prove you wrong.  When I tell April ab out all of the ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygone s be bygones.

Grace:  You’re dreaming.  She won’t be duped by a bun ch of empty promises.

Yuji:  They’re not empty promises.  I really am going to  change, within reason.

Grace:  Do you really think April is going to forget al l of the things you’ve done to her in the past?

Yuji:  I’m not going to rake up the past.  I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere.  After all, she used to be crazy ab out me.  I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.

 Grace:  Pride comes before a fall, you know.  I think you ’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and begged her for mercy!

[end of dialogue]

Grace begins by asking Yuji, “What are you doing?”  Yuji says, “I’m working on a plan to get April back.”  April was his girlfriend.  “T o get (someone) back” means to convince or persuade someone to continue a romantic re lationship that you had stopped or the other person had stopped.

Grace says, “I think that’s a lost cause.”  A “cause” (cause), as a noun, can be something that you are fighting for, something that you  want to change about the world.  Your cause could be world peace or ending wor ld hunger.  That would be a cause.  The expression “a lost cause” means that you will never be able to accomplish that; it’s impossible for you to do.  We use th is in daily conversation when we see someone trying to do something and we want  to tell them that it would be impossible to do that; we might say, “That’s a lost cause.”  Grace thinks that trying to get April back is a lost cause.  She says, “Yo u guys (meaning you two) broke up three months ago.”  “To break up” mean s to end a romantic relationship.  It’s a phrasal verb meaning you no long er want to be with this other person.  “There’s no way,” Grace says, “April will take you  back.”  “To take (someone) back” is the opposite of “to get (someone) back” in that you are the one who agrees to resume the relationship.  So if I want to get my girlfriend back she would have to take me back; that is, accept that we w ill continue the relationship.

Yuji doesn’t think this is a lost cause.  He says, “Watch me  prove you wrong,” meaning observe me, watch as I prove you wrong.  “To pro ve someone wrong” means to demonstrate that the other person is incorrect – is not right about something.  Yuji says, “When I tell April about all the  ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygones be bygones.”  S o, Yuji’s plan is to tell April, his ex-girlfriend, how he’s going to change.  T his, of course, is something that men often promise to women: “I’ll change; I’ll b e a different person; I’ll make you happy.”  If this happens, Yuji says, if he tells her th is, then April will let bygones be bygones.  “To let bygones (bygones) be bygones” m eans to ignore or forget about the bad things that have happened in the past, especially if they are painful things that someone did to you.  So for e xample, you may send a poem to your girlfriend, and your girlfriend says, “O h, thank you for the poem. Luis also wrote me a nice poem yesterday.”  Well, that cou ld be something that would be very damaging – something that would hurt yo u very much.  It hurt me – but this is just an example, okay?

 So, Yuji hopes that April will forget about the thin gs, probably the bad things that he did to her.  Grace says, “You’re dreaming,” meaning  you’re imagining something that will not happen.  “She won’t be duped  by a bunch of empty promises.”  Grace is saying that April won’t be duped.  “ To dupe” (dupe) means to fool someone, to make someone believe something that  isn’t true, to trick someone.  When we say, “I won’t be duped,” you mean I won’t let someone else trick me.  “She won’t be duped by a bunch of empty promi ses.”  “A bunch of” means a lot of – many.  A “promise” is when you say to som eone I will do this in the future.  An “empty promise” is something you say you will do, but you aren’t really going to do it.  So in this case, poor Yuji, acco rding to Grace, isn’t going to really do the things he says he’s going to do to change.

Yuji says, “They’re not empty promises.  I’m really going to change, within reason.”  The expression “within reason” means something that isn’t very small but isn’t very large, with moderation, without going to extremes.  You might say, for example: “I want to help my friend who doesn’t ha ve a job.  I will help him financially, within reason,” meaning I can’t give him 1 00,000 dollars; I’m going to help him but there is a limit to how much I can help him.  That’s really the meaning here.  When someone says “within reason,” often they mean there are certain limits to what I can do.  In this case, Yuji says he’s really going to change, within reason, which makes us think he really isn’t going to change very much. “Reason,” as well as the word “cause,” which we used earl ier, have additional meanings in English; look at our Learning Guide for mo re explanations.

Grace says, “Do you really think April is going to forget all of the things you’ve done to her in the past?”  Yuji says, “I’m not going to  rake up the past.”  “To rake (rake) up the past” means to talk about things that happ ened previously; to make other people remember things they might have forgotte n or ignored, usually bad things that happened in the past.  The verb “rake” is al so used when we are collecting leaves in the autumn – in the fall.  When th ey fall from the tree, you want to get them off of your lawn – off of your fron t yard, and so you use something called a rake, it’s sort of like a broom, and you rake up the leaves. Well in this case, he’s talking about raking up the past.  Taking things out of the past – disturbing them, if you will, so the other perso n will remember them.

Yuji does not want to do this.  He says, “I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere.”  Boy, does Yuji not understand w omen!  “To be sincere” (sincere) means to be honest, to be truthful, to reall y mean what you are saying or doing.  He thinks that he can show April the new versi on of him.  He says, “After all, she used to be crazy about me.”  “To be crazy about (someone)”

 means to like or love someone very much, usually in a roman tic way.  You can also be crazy about a thing.  I’m crazy about baseball; I  love to watch baseball. Not as much as I love being with my wife, of course, thou gh it’s close!  Yuji says, “I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.”  “It’s just a matter of” means the only thing I have to do is make an effort, or make the effort.  “To make the effort” means to try very hard to do something, even if  you are not successful.

Grace says, “Pride comes before a fall, you know.”  This is an old expression. Pride, meaning someone who is very confident in themselve s – who thinks that they are great, comes before, is something that happens to someone right before there is a fall, when they unsuccessful, when they fail.  It’s basically a warning to people who think that they are great, who are very prou d of what they do that if they aren’t careful they will fail – they will have a fa ll.  Grace says, “I think you’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and be gged her for mercy!” “To get down on your knees” means to kneel, to put both  knees on the ground. Grace is saying that Yuji should kneel and beg April for mercy.  “To beg (someone) for (something)” means to ask someone to do some thing, especially when it is unlikely that the other person will do it b ecause the other person has all of the power.  “To beg (someone)” means to ask them d esperately.  Well here, Grace is suggesting Yuji will have to beg April for “mer cy,” which here means forgiveness, compassion.  To be nice to another person is m ercy (mercy). Sometimes when little children – boys, I mean – are fig hting, and one boy, for example grabs the arm of another boy and puts it behind  his back to hurt him, the other person might say, “Mercy!” meaning be nice to me; don’t keep hurting me. Grace thinks that April is going to have to have a lot of mercy in order to take Yuji back.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Grace:  What are you doing?

Yuji:  I’m working on a plan to get April back.
