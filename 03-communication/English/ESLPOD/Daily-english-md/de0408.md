[start of dialogue]

Candace:  Hello.

Mehdi:  Hello, may I speak to Candace Cho, please?

Candace:  Speaking.

Mehdi:  Oh, hello Ms. Cho.  My name is Mehdi and I’m i nterested in applying for the job as assistant manager.  Your name was listed as the  contact person.  Am I calling at a bad time?

Candace:  No, not at all.  I’m the administrative assist ant and I’m fielding calls for the person doing the hiring.  What can I do for you?

Mehdi:  Well, I read the job description and I think I  would be a good fit, but I was wondering if there are any special qualifications not me ntioned in the description.

Candace:  Well, requirements are spelled out in the description, and I don’t have much to add, really.  But I do know that the person doi ng the hiring is looking for someone to start immediately.  Can you do that?

 Mehdi:  Sure, that’s no problem.  I’ll be sure to men tion that in my cover letter. Thanks.

Candace:  If you’ve had experience managing a large staff , be sure to emphasize that in your résumé.  Any other questions?

Mehdi:  No, no other questions.  Thank you very much for yo ur time.  You’ve been very helpful.

Candace:  Your questions show a lot of initiative.  I’m sure you’ll do fine.

Mehdi:  Thanks, I really appreciate the vote of confidence .

The telephone conversation begins with Candace picking u p the phone and saying, “Hello.”  Mehdi says, “Hello, may I speak to Candac e Cho, please?”  The expression “may I speak to...” is a polite way of asking someo ne on the telephone to speak to a specific person: “Hello.  May I s peak to the manager, please?”

Candace responds, “Speaking.”  If you answer the phone a nd someone asks for you but doesn’t know that it is you who is talking on the phone, you say “speaking.”  In other words, the person you are asking for  is speaking: “I am that person.”  That’s another way of saying “speaking” – yes, th is is me.

Mehdi says, “Oh, hello Ms. Cho.”  Notice that in business,  “Ms.” is the most common way of addressing a woman.  “My name is Mehdi and  I’m interested in applying for the job as assistant manager.  Your name wa s listed as the contact person.”  So, Mehdi is saying that he wants to apply for the job; he wants to fill out an application and be interviewed.  Candace Cho wa s listed as the contact person.  “Listed,” here, just means her name appeared in the advertisement. The “contact person” is the person who you call or write  to if you want more information about something.

Mehdi says, “Am I calling at a bad time?”  This is a poli te phrase we use to make sure that the person that we are calling, who may not b e expecting our call – who didn’t know we were going to call – is not busy, that t hey don’t have something else they need to do instead of talking to you on the te lephone.  It also gives them an opportunity to say, “Well, yes, this is a busy time .  Can you call me back tomorrow at 10 o’clock?” for example.

 Candace says, “No, not at all,” meaning no, this is not a  bad time, which is another way of saying yes, this is a good time, I can talk n ow.  She says, “I’m the administrative assistant and I’m fielding calls for the person doing the hiring.”  An “administrative assistant” is another word or term for a secretary, or someone who does work in an office to help other employees, such a s answering phones and emails, writing letters, making photocopies, and so f orth.  We used to just call these people secretaries, but now we call the admin istrative assistants; it sounds more important.

Candace says she’s “fielding calls.”  To “field (field) call s” means to answer phone calls for someone else – for another person, usuall y a more important person, someone that you are working for who doesn’t wa nt to answer his or her own phone calls.  So, to “field calls” also means to deci de which phone calls are important enough to give to the person you work for.  T his verb, “to field,” has a couple of interesting different meanings in English: ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  You’ll also f ind in our Learning Guide a discussion of “phone etiquette,” that is, common practices in talking on the telephone in the United States.  That’s also in our Le arning Guide.

Candace says that she’s “fielding calls (or fielding phone  calls) for the person doing the hiring.”  Someone who “hires” is someone wh o selects the person to work in a new job.  So, you apply to a company for a job , someone in the company has to make the final decision to hire you – to em ploy you, to give you the job.

“What can I do for you?” Candace asks.  Mehdi says, “Well, I read the job description and I think I would be a good fit.”  The “ job description” is usually a short written document that has information – specific in formation about the job, including what you will have to do and what the qualif ications are.  That is, what you need in terms of education and experience in order to get the job.  That’s the job description.  The job description for my job as host o f ESL Podcast would be to be very good looking and to be a good singer – fort unately I am very qualified for that!  Mehdi says he thinks he’ll be a “good fit” for the job, meaning that the job will be similar to his own experience and his own ed ucation; he will be able to do everything the job needs him to do.  So, it’s a good  match – it’s a good fit between the job and Mehdi.

Mehdi says, “I was wondering if there are any special qual ifications (thing that he will need to be able to do) not mentioned in the jo b description.”  Candace says, “Well, requirements are spelled out in the description .”  Here, to “spell out” means to provide detailed information, to include all of the details.  The job description spells out all the things that you need to do in order to get paid.  To

 “spell out” means to give details.  It actually has a coupl e of different meanings; take a look, once again, at our Learning Guide for some  additional explanations of this expression, to “spell out.”

Candace says, “I don’t have much to add (meaning I don’t have any additional information I can give you about this).  But I do know t hat the person doing the hiring is looking for someone to start immediately.”  I n other words, they want someone who can begin work immediately, who doesn’t need  a week or two weeks before they can begin working.  “Can you do that? ” Candace asks, and Mehdi says, “Sure, that’s no problem.  I’ll be sure to mention that in my cover letter” – I will talk about that in my cover letter.  A “cover letter” is a, usually, one page letter that you send along with, perhaps, your rés umé or CV, the listing of all your jobs, experience, and education.  It’s something  you send when you are applying for a job.  So, it’s a letter that gives a summ ary of your qualifications; it gives the person a chance to get to know you a little bett er.  That’s a cover letter.

Candace said, “If you’ve had experience managing a large staff, be sure to emphasize that in your résumé.”  A “staff” is a group of employees; your employees can be called your “staff.”  To “emphasize” mea ns to say or write something in a way that makes it seem important, or mor e important.  Your résumé, or your CV (or curriculum vitae), is usually a one  or two – but could be much longer – page document that describes all of your e ducation, your work experience, your skills, perhaps any honors or awards that yo u’ve received; all this would be part of your résumé or CV.

Mehdi says he doesn’t have any other questions, and thanks C andace for her time.  Candace says, “Your questions show a lot of initiat ive.  I’m sure you’ll do fine.”  “Initiative” is the willingness and ability to d o something without someone else asking you to do it first.  So, you see something th at needs to be done at your job, you just go do it.  You don’t wait until som eone tells you or asks you to do something; you do it on your own initiative.  So, “sh owing initiative” is to demonstrate that you are willing to go and do somethin g without being asked first.

Mehdi thanks Candace and says, “I really appreciate the vo te of confidence.” Here, “vote of confidence” means support, the belief tha t you can do something – the belief that you are able to do something well.  S omeone says to you, “I’m sure that you will do this job very well,” they are giving  you a vote of confidence; they are saying yes, I support you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
