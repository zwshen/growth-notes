This episode is called “Guessing a Number.”  It’s a dialog ue between Angela and Dwight.  It’s also going to be using some vocabulary not  just about guessing, but – well, about numbers.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Hey, look at this.  This restaurant is holding a  contest.  If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!

Dwight:  I’ll take a stab at it.

Angela:  So will I.  Let’s see, I think there must be cl ose to 1,000 or 1,200 marbles in there.  What are you doing?

Dwight:  I’m doing some calculations in my head.  The bo wl is about 75 percent full, and it’s 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches (15”x12”x6” ).  The marbles are about /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter…

Angela:  Are you actually trying to figure out the capaci ty by crunching the numbers?  This is a game.  You’re supposed to guess.

Dwight:  I know it’s a game, but I want to increase my chances by making an educated guess.  Hold on, I just need to do one more ca lculation and I’ll have the magic number.

Angela:  That’s cheating.

 Dwight:  No way!  I’m just using what God gave me to b eat you out of a year’s worth of meals.

Angela:  Bring it on.  I’ll pit my random guess again st your educated guess any day!

Angela says to Dwight, “Hey, look at this.  This restaurant  is holding a contest.” A “contest” is a competition where different people par ticipate to try to win something.  We often use the verb “hold”: “I’m going t o hold a contest,” I’m going to have a competition.  “If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!”  “To gue ss” means to provide an answer even though you’re not sure if it is correct.  “G uess” actually has several meanings in English; you’ll find those in this episode’s L earning Guide.  “Marbles” are small, round pieces of colored glass.  You often find  them with children; they play a game where they roll the marbles on the floor.   This is, at one time, a popular contest in restaurants; they would have a big g lass bowl full of these little marbles and you had to try to guess the number of marble s in there.  Many different people would guess, and then if you guessed i t correctly you got some prize.

Dwight says, “I’ll take a stab (stab) at it.”  “To take a stab at (something)” means to either make a guess or try to do something even thou gh you will probably not be right, even though you may not succeed or be successful.  “To take a stab at” means to attempt to do something.  Angela says, “So will  I (meaning I will try to guess, too).  Let’s see, I think there must be close to 1,0 00 or 1,200 marbles in there.  What are you doing?”

Dwight says, “I’m doing some calculations in my head.”  “Ca lculations” are when you combine numbers: you add them, you subtract them, you m ultiply them, or you divide them to find out how much of something ther e is.  In general, calculations are what you do to solve some sort of mathemat ical problem. Dwight is doing them “in his head,” meaning mentally, not with a machine.  He says, “The bowl is about 75 percent full.”  “Percent (%)”  is 100th; it’s the amount of something out of 100 parts.  So, 75 percent would be 75 out of 100.  So, the bowl is 75 percent, or /.notdef.g0001 full; it’s about 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches (15”x12”x6”).  We talk about or use the word “by” when we are describing the length, the width, and the height of something.  If we say it’s 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches, we mean it is 15 inches long, 12 inches w ide, and 6 inches high.  Dwight says, “The marbles are about /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter.”  “Three

 quarters (/.notdef.g0001)” or “three fourths” is used also when talking about pa rt of something. Three fourths is written three over four ( /.notdef.g0001), there’s a diagonal line that divides them.  It’s the same, of course, as 75 percent, that’s th ree fourths of 100.  The marbles are /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter.  “Diameter” (diameter) is the distance across a circle.  If you take a circle and you cut it in half,  that length is the diameter.

Angela then says, “Are you actually trying to figure out  the capacity by crunching the numbers?”  “To figure out” means to understand, to  get an answer.  Dwight is trying to figure out the capacity of this jar where the marbles are.  “Capacity” is the amount of space available.  “To crunch the numbers”  is an idiom which means to make a mathematical calculation.  Often we tal k about that when, for example, we have a new project but we’re not sure if we  have enough money. We need to find out exactly how much it’s going to cost, I  may say, “I need to crunch the numbers.”

Angela says, “This is a game.  You’re supposed to guess.”  Dwight says, “I know it’s a game, but I want to increase my chances by making a n educated guess.” “To increase your chances” means to increase the likelihood  – the possibilities for you to win, to be successful.  If you are interviewing for a new job and you go to the interview in your swimming outfit – your swimming  trunks, which is what we call what a man wears, or your swimming suit for a w oman – well, that’s not really a very good strategy.  You could increase your chance s by wearing a suit instead of a bikini – although I look pretty good in a bikini!  Dwight says that he’s trying to make an educated guess.  An “educated guess” is st ill a guess – you still don’t know, but you have some facts or experience or knowledge that will help you make your guess.  Dwight says, “Hold on (wait one second), I just need to do one more calculation and I’ll have the magic numb er.”  “The magic number” just means the correct number here.

Angela says, “That’s cheating.”  “Cheating” is when you do  something against the rules, especially in a game, and this is contest – a kind of  game.  Dwight says, “No way (meaning that is completely wrong)!  I’m just usi ng what God gave me to beat you out of a year’s worth of meals.”  The expression “to use what God gave you (or someone)” means that you take advantage – you use  the intelligence and talent that you were born with.  This is especially true when many people do not have those talents.  So, if you are a very good skier, you could use what God gave you to go to the Olympics, for example.  Dwight says th at he’s going to use what God gave him – presumably, we’re guessing, the ma thematical ability he has – he’s going to use that to beat Angela out of a ye ar’s worth of meals.  “To beat (someone) out of (something)” means to win a ga me, a contest, or a

 competition against another person.  You win the price;  you take first place – you beat someone out of.  You can also say that, for example,  about a job: “He beat me out for that job at Berkeley.”  You could, I suppose,  say it about a woman or a man: “I beat my friend out for the affections and love  of this particular woman.” Hopefully, you are not in a competition!

Angela says to Dwight, “Bring it on.”  This is an inform al expression that’s used to show when you’re ready to do something; you’re ready for a friendly competition. “Bring it on” means I’m ready; I’m ready to enter into  this game and beat you. Angela says, “I’ll pit my random guess against your educated  guess any day!” “To pit (pit) (something) against (something else)” mea ns to test one thing against another, to see how well one person can do som ething compared to another person.  Angela says that she’s going to make a “random” guess, meaning she’s not going to try to calculate, she’s not g oing to crunch the numbers; she’s just going to take a random – we might sa y a “wild” – guess. She’s going to pit – she’s going to basically say my random guess is as good as – really better than your educated guess.  “Pit” Has a co uple of different meanings in English; of course, those are found in the L earning Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
