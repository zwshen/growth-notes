# Reaching a Milestone

Welcome to English as Second Language Podcast numbe r 1,000 – Reaching a Milestone.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,000. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

Our website is ESLPod.com. I thought we’d do someth ing a little special in the introduction to this one-thousandth episode. This i s a dialogue between Jeff and Lucy about reaching a milestone. Let’s get started.   

[start of dialogue] 

Jeff: Well, we’ve reached a milestone.  

Lucy: Yup, it’s been a long haul, but we’ve finally  made it. Did you ever think we’d get here?  

Jeff: I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out. I thought that our prospects  were iffy, at best.  

Lucy: Me, too. We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turning point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in  and day out. 

Jeff: So, what should we do now? 

Lucy: I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our achievements . . . so far. 

Jeff: That sounds good. Then what? 

Lucy: Put our noses back to the grindstone? 

Jeff: I was afraid you were going to say that!

We begin this episode with Jeff – that’s me – sayin g to Lucy, “Well, we’ve reached a milestone.” A “milestone” (milestone) is some significant event or achievement that indicates that you are making prog ress towards some goal. We  

often use this term in business nowadays, when talk ing about project management or project planning.  

When you have a big project, there are many things you have to do, many things you have to accomplish. Typically, you will divide up the different things you need to do and put them on a schedule so that, for examp le, by next Friday you will have completed this task, and by the Friday after t hat you will have completed that task, and so forth. These are milestones that you are setting up, that you are establishing, that you want to reach by a certain d ate or day. 

I begin the dialogue by saying that “we have reache d a milestone.” Lucy says, “Yup.” That’s an informal way of saying “yes” or “y eah.” “Yup (yup), it’s been a long haul but we’ve finally made it.” A “long haul”  (haul) is a long and difficult or challenging period of time that you have to go thro ugh in order to reach your goal, to reach your objective, or in this case, to reach your milestone of 1,000 episodes, of course.  

Lucy says, “It’s been a long haul” – it’s been a di fficult journey, it’s been a long journey – but we have “made it,” she says. “We’ve f inally made it.” “To make it” means to achieve your goal, to accomplish what you wanted to accomplish, to reach the milestone in your project as you are maki ng progress towards the final goal or objective.  

Lucy says, “Did you ever think we’d get here?” She’ s asking me if I ever thought we would get to this particular milestone, and I sa y, quite honestly, “I admit I had my doubts.” When we say “I admit,” we’re saying tha t what we are about to say is something that we may not have wanted to say or per haps are embarrassed to say. Here, it perhaps means “to be really honest wi th you.”  

I say, “I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out.” “To be dubious” (dubious) m eans to be full of doubts, to be uncertain – not to be sure if something is going  to happen or if something is true. I say, “I was really dubious that this ventur e would pan out.” A “venture” (venture) is an effort to do something that is chal lenging or difficult, especially as it relates to a business, for example, or an organi zation.  

If someone talks about starting a new venture, they ’re talking about starting a new organization or, more commonly, a new business.  We have the expression “venture capitalists.” A “venture capitalist” is so meone who goes out and invests in, gives money to, new businesses in the hope that  the business will be successful and that venture capitalist will get his  or her money back – plus a profit, of course.  

 I say I was “dubious that this venture would pan ou t.” “To pan (pan) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to be successful, especia lly in making something financially successful, or in some other way succes sful. You could also talk about your relationship “not panning out.” “I went out on  a date with this girl, but it didn’t pan out.” She didn’t like me. She had another boyfr iend. You know, the usual excuses.  

I say, “I thought that our prospects were iffy at b est.” Your “prospects” (prospects) are the chances that you are going to d o well. It’s the likelihood of future success. In sports, we sometimes talk about “prospects” to refer to young baseball players who are very talented and who we t hink will be successful in the future. You could also talk about your prospects fo r employment, for getting a job. If someone graduates with a degree in, I don’t  know, ancient history, that person might not have very good prospects for the f uture. That’s me, by the way. I graduated with a degree in ancient history many y ears ago – not 2,000 years ago, but many years ago. 

I say that “I thought our prospects were iffy, at b est.” “Iffy” (iffy) means doubtful, not certain. It’s somewhat of an informal term that  we would use when we are not sure something is going to happen, when we are doub tful something will happen. We might say, “I want to try this new restaurant, b ut it’s a bit iffy,” or “It seems a little iffy.” We mean it could be very good, or it could be very bad. We’re not sure.  

“At best” means at the most. When I say, “Our prosp ects were iffy, at best,” I mean that they were, at most, doubtful – meaning th ey were very doubtful. The best-case scenario – the best possible outcome or s ituation – was in this case “iffy.” You might say, for example, “We’ll probably  make $200 today at best.” “At best” there means the maximum amount, the most that  we will make.  

Lucy says, “Me, too.” She agrees our prospects were  iffy at best. She says, “We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turni ng point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in and day out.” When yo u say you have an “auspicious (auspicious) start” to something, you m ean you have a good beginning, a favorable beginning – a beginning that  indicates that things will turn out well. However, in our case, Lucy says we did no t have an auspicious start, “but we had a turning point.”  

A “turning point” is some event or situation that c auses you suddenly to become very successful or not very successful. In general,  it means that you have some event that causes things to change significantly fr om the way they were going before that event. If your girlfriend says, “We’ve reached a turning point in our  

relationship,” she means either things are going to  get much better or they’re going to get much worse. (I don’t know. It depends on your girlfriend.)  

The “turning point” would be a sudden change or sig nificant change – something important that will affect the way things are going  – or rather, the way things will go in the future. We had a turning point in this ve nture after a few months of “grinding out the work.” “To grind (grind) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to continue to do something, especially if it perhaps isn’t very interesting, or if it requires a lot of work, or possibly both.  

“To grind out” something means to work hard and get  it done, even if it isn’t always the most pleasant or pleasurable thing to do . That’s not true with our podcast, of course. But in the script, Lucy says th at we had a turning point “after a few months of grinding out the work, day in and d ay out.”  

That expression “day in and day (day) out” means da y after day. It’s a phrase that we use to emphasize that something happens eve ry day without rest. “Day in and day out, you get up in the morning, and you eat breakfast, and you go to work, and you come home, and you read a book or wat ch television, and you eat your dinner, and you go to bed.” That happens “day in and day out” for many people.  

Jeff – that’s me again – says, “What should we do n ow?” Lucy says, “I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our ac hievements so far.” “Celebratory” comes from the verb “to celebrate” (c elebrate). “To celebrate” means to do something to mark or to remember some s ignificant event or situation. We celebrate our birthdays – we have a p arty or we go out to dinner. That’s “to celebrate.” You do something that makes you happy, something that will make you remember how good this event or this situation is.  

Lucy is proposing we have a “celebratory drink.” No rmally when you use the word “drink” in American English, you’re talking ab out an alcoholic drink such as beer or wine or whiskey or rum. I like rum, persona lly. That’s my favorite alcohol, but I don’t drink alcohol very much anymore – hardl y ever, really. But if I did, I would drink rum.  

Anyway, back to the story, we’re having a celebrato ry drink, Lucy says, “a toast to our achievements.” A “toast” (toast) here refers  to words that you say, usually while raising a glass of some alcohol or some alcoh olic drink in your hand, in order to honor or to celebrate or to remember some particular person or event. When you get married in the United States, it’s com mon for one of the members  

of your, what we would call “wedding party” – the g roup of people who are part of the wedding celebration – to make a toast.  

“To make a toast” means to stand up and say, “Here’ s to the new bride and groom” – here’s to the newly married couple. They’r e saluting, they’re toasting, they’re celebrating these people. Sometimes a toast  is just one or two words. In English we would say, for example, “Cheers!” In oth er languages, there are other common words that are used when someone picks up th eir glass of alcohol and makes a toast.  

I say, “That sounds good” – the drink sounds good, that is. Then I say, “Then what?” – then what do we do? Lucy says, “Put our no ses back to the grindstone?” “To put your nose (nose) back to the g rindstone (grindstone)” means to go back to your hard work, your difficult work, after taking a short break.  

So, if you work eight hours every day, you might ta ke a break for 10 or 15 minutes in the morning. After your break, you may s ay, “Well, now I have to put my nose back to the grindstone.” I have to continue  working hard at what I was working on before I took my break.  

Jeff says, “I was afraid you were going to say that .” That expression, “I was afraid you were going to say that,” is used when we knew t he other person was going to say that, but we didn’t really want them to say that – perhaps because, in this case, I don’t want to put my nose back to the grind stone. But I must. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Jeff: Well, we’ve reached a milestone.  

Lucy: Yup, it’s been a long haul, but we’ve finally  made it. Did you ever think we’d get here?

Jeff: That sounds good. Then what? 

Lucy: Put our noses back to the grindstone? 

Jeff: I was afraid you were going to say that!
