<p> Chico loves to drive, always in high speeds.
Another Chico's love is Forró, a kind of music very popular in the
Northeast Brazilian. But Chico's city doesn't have many Forró parties
and he needs to travel to other cities if he wishes to go to a Forró
party. </p>

<p> Chico, besides driving and Forró dancing, also
likes computers and programming. As he is a very good programmer, he
decides to make a program to calculate the best way to go from his city
to a city where will have a Forró party. But, unfortunately, Chico
needs to go out with his girlfriend and can not do the program, so he
asked for your help. </p>

<p> But Chico's car has a problem with the brakes
and he can not fix because if he does this he will not have money to buy
the party's ticket and drink some beers. So you should find a route
where Chico brakes only once, when he arrives in his destiny. Because he
can not break, is dangerous pass by a city, so Chico should through the 
minimum number of cities in his travel.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file
contains several input sets. The description of each set is given below:</p>

<p>Each set starts with
one integer <b>R</b> (<b>0 &lt; R &le; 5000</b>), the number of roads.
Next <b>R</b> lines describe the roads
and consist of two cities name, where each city name has at most <b>30</b>
characters, and <b>V</b> (<b>0 &lt; V &le; 1000</b>) the Chico's car
velocity when Chico travels between the cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.
You can assume that <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are not the same city and
can exist more than one road between two cities. After
this there is a line with two city names, the fist is the city where
Chico lives and the other is the city where the Forró party will
happen. </p>

<p>There will be at most <b>500</b>
different cities. Input is terminated by EOF and there is a blank line
beteween two input sets.</p>


<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input set you should
print the route for Chico to go from his city to the Forró
party city, with a blank space between two cities, so he brakes only once and 
through the minimum number of cities. If there is more than one route, print
that where the cities appear first in the input (see the last input). If there is
no possible route print "<b>No valid route.</b>", without the quotes. Print a blank
line between the outputs. See the 
examples below for the exact input/output format. </p>
