Our topic today is “Planning a Protest,” when you want to tell people that you are against something in public.  This is a dialogue between  Becky and Pedro, and we’ll listen to them discuss some common problems – some comm on issues when you are having a protest.  Let’s get started.

Becky:  I want to thank all of you for coming today.  I th ink we all agree that we need to organize a protest…

Pedro:  Hold on, Becky.  We all want to voice our opinio n that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer .

Becky:  With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the  best way to do that.

Pedro:  That may be, but I think we need to consider a  few things first.  Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people.  That m eans getting them to show up, to march, and to hold up signs.  I’m not sure we ha ve enough time to pull it all off.

Becky:  Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed.  If we decide to protest, we want to do it right so that we g et a lot of media coverage. I’m confident that we have enough people and time to get it all done.

Pedro:  Okay, but another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest.  The other side isn’t going to take things lying down.

 Becky:  You’re right, and we’ll take that into considerat ion.  Is there any more discussion before we start on the planning?  No?  Okay, le t’s get down to business.

Our episode begins with Becky saying, “I want to thank all  of you for coming today.”  Becky is obviously talking to a group of people.  S he says, “I think we all agree that we need to organize a protest,” something that you do to show other people you think a situation is wrong or unfair.  Pedro  says, “Hold on, Becky.” This expression, “hold on,” means wait a minute, or slow down, or stop for a certain amount of time.  We use it when we want someon e to stop what they are saying or to let you have a chance to say something.  It’s a n informal expression, for the most part.

“Hold on, Becky,” Pedro says, “We all want to voice our op inion that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer.”  Pedro says they all want to voice their opinion.  To “voice” something means to express your opinions (your ideas) by speaking, letting other people know what you think. “Voice” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Pedro says they want to voice their opinion that they “opp ose,” or are against, what is going on here, but he’s not sure a protest is the answer, meaning is the right thing to do for this situation.  Becky says, “With al l due respect, Pedro.” That expression, “with all due respect,” means I don’t want to offend you – I don’t want to make you angry, but I have to disagree with you.   Becky says, “With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the best way to do  that” – the best way to show people we oppose this situation.  A “rally” is a la rge meeting with many people in a public place, usually so they can show their su pport or opposition to something or someone.  For example, a politician may visit  a city and have a rally, where thousands of people come, and applaud, an d listen to the politician speak.

Pedro says, “That may be (meaning you might be correct th at a rally is the best way to do this), but I think we need to consider a few things first.  Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people,” Pedro says.  The expression “to take to the streets” means to do something in public, usuall y to express an opinion, to do something so that everyone else can see it, usually a ral ly or a protest or sometimes a “march,” which is when people walk down the s treet carrying signs to protest something.

 Pedro says the action of taking it to the streets means “coo rdinating,” or organizing, a lot of people.  “That means getting the m to show up, to march, and to hold up signs.”  To “show up,” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to attend an event, to come to a place where you are expected to be.   So if you are supposed to meet your friend at the movies and you never go, we  would say you didn’t show up.  You may not have your friend much longer, eith er!  Pedro says that you need to get people to show up, to march (to walk wi th these signs in the street), and to hold up signs.  To “hold up” a sign mea ns to use your arms to put a sign, usually a large piece of paper that has a message on it about what you are protesting about.  Often these signs will have a pie ce of wood (a wooden stick) that we use to hold the sign up so that you can ge t it higher into the air. Pedro says, “I’m not sure we have enough time to pull it  all off.”  To “pull (something) off” means to be able to do something tha t is very difficult, to successfully complete something that is difficult.

Becky says to Pedro, “Don’t get me wrong.”  This is a phrase used to show that you don’t want what you are about to say (what you are g oing to tell someone) to be misinterpreted or misunderstood.  Usually this means you ’re going to say something that the other person will disagree with.  I t’s similar to the expression Becky used earlier: “with all due respect.”  Becky says, “Don’t  get me wrong.  I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed.”  To be “in favor of” something means to be in support of something, wanting something to ha ppen.  The expression “half-assed” is a very informal expression, something that  is a little bit vulgar. The word “ass” refers to what you sit on in your chair, b ut it’s not a nice word – not a word you would want your children to use.  The e xpression “half-assed” means not done very well, mediocre, only done partially.  Someone who doesn’t do everything they’re supposed to do, we might describe th at as “half-assed.” But again, it’s a little bit vulgar, not something you  would want to say to your boss – if you wanted to keep your job!

Becky says, “If we decide to protest, we want to do it righ t (we want to do it correctly) so that we get a lot of media coverage.”  “Me dia” refers to newspapers, television stations, radio stations, magazines, Internet we bsites; all of these are part of the media.  “Coverage” is when they print or a ir or publish something related to your story.  So, press coverage or media coverag e is when the media publish a story about your event.

Becky said, “I’m confident that we have enough people and  time to get it all done” – to get everything accomplished.  Pedro says, “Okay, b ut another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest.”  A “counte r protest” is when one

 group is protesting for something, and then there’s ano ther group in the same place that is protesting against something, that same thi ng.  So the two protest groups are facing each other.  Sometimes this is a probl em, especially if they start fighting – physically fighting.  Pedro says, “The o ther side (the people who disagree with them) isn’t going to take things lying do wn.”  To “take (something) lying down” means to accept something bad that happens w ithout fighting it, without disagreeing with it; to be “passive,” we might  say.

Becky says, “You’re right, and we’ll take that into consider ation (we’ll think about that).  Is there any more discussion before we start on the planning?” she says to the group.  “Okay, then let’s get down to business.”  The  phrase “let’s get down to business” is used to show that you are ready to start wor king on something important, that you don’t want to wait any longer; you  want to get started on what you are working on: “let’s get down to business.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
