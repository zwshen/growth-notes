This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 144. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

[start of dialog]

David: Hey, Sally. Can I run something by you?

Sally: Sure, what's up?

David: Well, a friend of a friend wanted some help with her taxes and we agreed that we would talk about it over dinner. At the end  of the night, when the check came, she expected me to pay! It was really awkward . It wasn't a date and I was doing her a favor! Am I crazy or was she taking adv antage of me?

Sally: It definitely sounds like she took advantage  of your generosity. If she was asking a favor, she should have paid. No question.

David: The thing is, I thought she was really prett y and I wanted to ask her out after I met her. But, now I'm not sure.

Sally: Well, I think that unless you asked her out,  you shouldn't have to pay for her. And, these days, a lot of people go Dutch even  if one person asks  the other. Based on what happened the other night, I'd stay aw ay from this woman. That is, unless you don't mind being her sugar daddy.

David: Yeah, right. I'm too broke to be anybody's s ugar daddy, even if I wanted to. I think you're right. That will be the last is ee of her.

In this podcast, we have a man asking a woman’s adv ice about the issue of who should pay when a man and a woman go out to dinner.  The dialog begins with David saying, “Can I run something by you?” “To run  something by someone” means, usually, to tell them and to ask for their o pinion. So, you’re giving someone an idea or giving them some information and  asking them to give you their opinion about it. So, David says, “Hey, Sally . Can I run something by you?” And Sally says, “Sure. What’s up?” meaning what is it that you want to talk about. David says that a “friend of a friend” – not his fr iend, but a friend of his friends – had wanted some help with her taxes. Here, when som eone says, “I will help you with your taxes (taxes)” that means they will help you prepare the paperwork or the forms that you have to send in to the governmen t. “Taxes,” of course, is money you pay the government. In the United States,  we have “income tax” – a federal national income tax and you have to send in  information every year, by April 15th of how much money you made last year. Ho w much taxes you paid already and then you have to send any additional ta x that you owe the government.

Well, David is going to help this woman prepare her  taxes and they decided to talk about it “over dinner.” When we say, “over din ner,” or “over lunch,” or “over some meal,” we mean while we are eating dinner or r ight after we eat dinner. So, if someone says, “Let’s talk about it over lunch” they mean let’s go to lunch and there we can talk about it.

Well, at the end of the night, David says, when the  bill or the check came, she, the woman, expected David to pay. David said, “It w as really awkward.” “To be awkward” (awkward) means that it was strange, it wa s odd. “Awkward” is when neither person feels very comfortable, and no one k nows quite what to do. So, for example, if you were talking to a woman that you are romantically interested in and her husband came up and started talking to her,  that might be a little awkward for you – sometimes the same as embarrassin g but not always. It just means uncomfortable situation.

David says that the dinner that he was having wasn’ t a date. A “date,” of course, (date) is when a man and a woman go out, or you go out with someone you are romantically interested in – have dinner, a movie a nd so forth. Well, David says that he was doing her a favor. And “to do someone a  favor” means that you are helping them. You are doing something nice for them . David says, “Am I crazy? Or was she taking advantage of me?” That expression  “Am I crazy?” means am I wrong? Isn’t this obvious that I am right and the o ther person is wrong? “Am I crazy or was she taking advantage of me?” “To take advantage of someone” means that, for example, I ask you to come over to my house to help me fix something in my house – fix my computer – and when you’re there, you say,

“Yes,” and then I say, “Oh, and can you fix my brot her’s computer, my sister’s computer and my uncle’s computer?” Well, you are ta king advantage of that person, meaning you’re asking them to do something much more than what they said. They were being nice to you and then you trea t them in a not very nice or not very considerate way. So, to take advantage of someone is a negative thing.

Well, Sally says that it definitely sounds like the  woman took advantage of his generosity. “Generosity” means, of course, to be ge nerous – means to give other people your time or your money or things – that is to be generous, to be nice. Sally says that she, the woman at the dinner, shoul d have paid. No question. We say, “No question” – we mean there is no doubt. This is absolutely certain that this is correct – no question. David then says, “Th e thing is, I thought she was really pretty.” That is a very common expression. “ The thing is” – to tell someone that you are about to tell them something important  or something interesting. It’s another way of saying, “What I am about to say is very important.”

Well, David says that he thought the woman was very  pretty and he wanted to ask her out after he met her. “To ask someone out” means, you probably know, to ask them to go with you on a romantic date. Sall y then says that unless David asked the woman out, he should not have had to pay for her. She then goes on to say that a lot of people “go Dutch.” “To go Dutc h” – capital (Dutch) – means that everyone pays for themselves. So, when two peo ple go out to dinner and they decide to go “Dutch,” that means each person w ill pay for their own meal. “Dutch” is an adjective – means from the Netherland s, the country in Europe, and probably not a very nice thing to say about people from the Netherlands, but it’s an expression we use in English. “To go Dutch” mean s that everyone pays for themselves. “To invite someone” would mean that you  paid – you would pay for them. But to go Dutch, you pay for yourself.

Well, she says – Sally says to David that he should  stay away from this woman, meaning he should not be with or try to go out with  this woman. That is, she says, unless you don’t mind being her “sugar daddy. ” “Unless you don’t mind,” meaning if it doesn’t bother you – “being her sugar  daddy.” It’s kind of a funny expression “sugar (sugar) daddy (daddy)” – like a f ather. “To be a sugar daddy” means that you are a man who pays for everything th at a woman wants, and again, it’s sort of the idea that she is taking adv antage of you if you are romantically interested in each other. “To be a sug ar daddy” would be to pay for all of her bills, all of her food, and so forth. It ’s a negative term, however.

Sally here uses it as a joke and David says, in res ponse, he says, “Yeah, right.” That expression “Yeah, right” means I disagree, tha t’s not true. You would think it would mean I agree, but it actually means the oppos ite when you say it with that

particular intonation that particular tone. “Yeah, right” means I don’t believe you – that’s not something that I agree with. David says that he’s “too broke to be anybody’s sugar daddy.” “To be broke” (broke) means  not to have any money. I’m broke. I don’t have any money – that’s true – n ot just in the story. Well, David then says that the dinner he had with this woman, “ will be the last I see of her.” “The last (last)” means I won’t be seeing her again .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.
