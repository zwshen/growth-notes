# Hotel Housekeeping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 87: Hotel Housekeeping. 

You are listening to English as a Second Language P odcast episode 87.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

Today’s podcast is going to be about staying in a h otel room and getting services from housekeeping.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

I’m so glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out  to be a dump.  The last time I went on vacation, I booked it online sight unseen, and it turned out to be a run down motel.  This hotel was completely different.  The décor was tasteful and updated, the staff was friendly, and the rooms were  well-maintained.   

Well, that is, until my second day there.  When I l eft my room in the morning, I had removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping would know I needed my room made up.  When I got back in the afternoon, though, it hadn’t been done properly.  The maid had made the b ed, cleaned the bathroom, and re-stocked the mini-bar, but she hadn’t vacuume d the carpet and didn’t leave any soap or clean towels.  I called down to the fro nt desk to make a complaint. 

“Front desk.  How may I help you?” 

“Hello.  I’m in room 1201 and housekeeping didn’t l eave any soap or clean towels.  And, the floor still needs to be vacuumed. ” 

“Oh, I’m so sorry.  Let me connect you with houseke eping.”  I waited on hold. 

“Housekeeping.” 

“Yes, this is room 1201.  The maid who cleaned my r oom didn’t leave any soap or clean towels, and the floor needs vacuuming.” 

“Okay.  I’ll get someone up there right away to tak e care of that.”   

About 10 minutes later, the maid knocked on the doo r.  I stepped out of the room and she left the toiletries in the bathroom and vac uumed.   That was pretty quick service.  I’m glad I didn’t get the run-around.

Today we are traveling and staying at a hotel.  I b egin the story by talking about how I was glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out to be a dump.  The verb “to book” (book) has nothing to do with books that you read, it’s another word for a reservation or to reserve.  So, “I reserved a room”  is the same as “I booked a room.”  We tend to use that verb particularly for h otels, but you can also say “I booked a flight to New York,” meaning I bought an a irplane ticket.  I said that the hotel didn’t turn out to be a dump.  “To turn out” means it didn’t result in, it didn’t end up.  “End up” “turn out” are two verbs that mea n in this case pretty much the same thing, that the final result wasn’t.  The hote l, I said, wasn’t a “dump” (dump).  That’s a…again, a very particular expressi on – special expression we use for a house or a hotel or some building that is  not very clean, that isn’t very well managed or organized – not very clean, that wo uld be a dump.  A “dump” is also a place where you put garbage and trash.  Ever y city has a city dump where the trash and garbage that is collected is put, and  that’s where the expression comes from: it’s a ugly, dirty place. 

I said that I booked my vacation hotel online sight  unseen.  The expression “sight (sight) unseen (unseen)” means that I didn’t look a t it, that I didn’t have a chance to physically go there and see what it was like bef ore I booked it.  So if I’m going to travel to another city, such as San Francisco, a nd I book a hotel room, and I’ve never seen the hotel, well then, I’m booking it sig ht unseen.  I said that the hotel I booked for my vacation turned out to be a run down motel.  To be “run down” means that it’s old, it needs repairs, there are ma ny things that are broken or dirty.  You can have a run down hotel.  You could h ave a run down car, an old car doesn’t look very nice.  A “motel” (motel) is s imilar to a hotel (hotel), but usually a motel is smaller.  It comes from the expr ession “motor hotel,” I believe. It’s a hotel that usually is for people who are sta ying a short amount of time, not very luxurious, not a nice place, but often a clean  place, not necessarily a run down place.  That’s a motel.  I said that the “déco r” (décor), which is, I’m sure, a French word.  In English, it means the decorations,  how it looks.  “The staff,” I said, “was friendly (the “staff” are all the people  that work at the hotel, the employees) and the rooms were well-maintained,” mea ning they were clean and they didn’t need repairs and so forth. 

Well, I then said that on my second day in the hote l I removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping wou ld know I needed my room  

made up.  Couple of expressions there: “Do Not Dist urb,” that’s the sign the hotel gives you to put outside your door so that in the m orning the “maid,” the person who cleans the room, doesn’t knock on your door or come into your…your hotel room if you’re still sleeping for example.  I like to sleep late, especially when I’m on vacation, so I always put the “Do Not Disturb.”  “To disturb” means to bother, so you’re saying don’t bother me, don’t wake me up.   I use the term “housekeeping,” and “housekeeping,” of course you p robably know, is the word that we give to the department in a hotel that clea ns and makes the beds, changes the sheets and the towels, and so forth.  T hat’s all one word: “housekeeping.”  “To keep house” as a verb would me an to make sure everything is clean and organized and so forth. 

I said I needed my room made up.  That two-word ver b, “made up,” here means, for a hotel, that it needs to be cleaned, that the bed sheets need to be changed, that new towels need to be put in the bathroom.  Th is is to make up a room.  My room needed to be made up.  Now, “made up” can also  mean invented, like “I made up a story” means I invented a story, I create d a story that isn’t true.  But here, it’s a…as a verb it means to clean and so for th in a hotel room. 

The maid made my bed.  “Maid” (maid) is, as we said  before, the person that cleans the room, and “to make the bed” means to put  new sheets on, and to make sure the sheets are tight, and that it’s…the b ed looks nice.  That’s to make the bed.  So the maid had made (“make” in the past tense is “made”) the bed. She re-stocked the mini-bar.  The “mini-bar” is my favorite part of the hotel room; it’s that little refrigerator and there are usually  in American hotels little bottles of alcohol, which you can buy.  They’re not free; they ’ll charge you for them when you leave the hotel – when you check out of the hot el.  That’s called a mini-bar, and “to stock,” or “to re-stock” means to put thing s in there.  So if they re-stock the mini-bar, that means that I took some things ou t – I drank some things, and now they’re putting new ones back in.  Mini-bars ha ve things other than alcohol; they have soda pop, like Coke and Pepsi, that sort of thing as well.  The maid had not vacuumed the carpet.  “To vacuum,” of cours e, is to take a machine, which is called a vacuum that lifts the dirt up fro m a carpet.  And, so therefore I called the front desk to make a complaint.  The “fr ont desk” is sometimes called “reception,” and that’s the place where when you fi rst walk into the hotel you check in, and where you check out of the hotel.  In  some countries it’s common for you to leave your key to your room when you lea ve the hotel, and to pick the key back up when you come back.  But in American ho tels, that’s very…that’s not the way it is done.  They give you a key, usual ly an electronic key like a credit card, and that is your key.  You don’t get a physic al key to your hotel room that you leave at the front desk. 

I called down and I told the housekeeping – I asked  for housekeeping, and the person at the front desk said, “Let me connect you, ” in other words, let me connect you to that telephone that you need speak t o, or the person you need to speak to.  And when housekeeping answered the phone , I said, “Yes, this is room 1201.”  In other words, I am on the 12 th  floor of the hotel.  Notice that we don’t same room one thousand two hundred and one, o r we don’t say room one two zero one, although you could say that.  It’s mu ch more common to say twelve zero one, or even more common in the United States: twelve oh one.  We, of course use, oh and zero to mean the same thing m any times.  And I complain, of course, about my room, and about 10 minutes late r, the maid comes up and knocks on my door.  And then I said I stepped out o f the room.  “To step out of the room” means I left the room.  Sometimes that ex pression, “to step out,” means to go somewhere, to leave to somewhere.  “I’m  going to step out for a few minutes” means I’m going to leave and be back in a few minutes.  The maid left the toiletries in the bathroom.  The word “toiletri es” comes, of course, from “toilet,” or the bathroom or the restroom, but thos e are all the things that you might use in a bathroom, like mouthwash or shampoo or things for your hair like conditioner.  Those are all toiletries. 

At the end of the story, I said I was glad I didn’t  get the run-around.  “To get the run-around,” and “run-around is normally hyphenated  (run-around). “To get the run-around” means that you are not getting a straig ht or an honest answer from people, or that they are not doing what they are su pposed to do to help you.  So for example you go to a store and you complain that  the – I don’t know – the iPod Nano is scratching, and they say, “Well, no, that’s  not really a problem.  It’s…it’s okay…well, you know,” that is getting the run-aroun d, when they’re not giving you what you expect. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, and this time at a native rate of speech.
