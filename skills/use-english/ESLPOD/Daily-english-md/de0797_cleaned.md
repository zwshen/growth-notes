 Our story begins when I say, “After three months of  summer vacation (“vacation” is when you don’t work), I was looking forward to t he start of a new school year.” Now the story begins, and I’m in my classroom talki ng to my students.  I begin by saying, “Okay, everybody, settle down.”  “To settle  down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop talking, to stop moving around , to listen to what I am saying.  It’s something that a teacher would say to  his or her students to get them to be quiet when they want to start their class.  S o, I say, “Okay, everybody settle down.  Take your seats and get out your textbook.”  “To take your seat” means to sit down, to go where you are supposed to sit down.   It doesn’t mean to pick up your seat and walk away, it means to sit in your ch air.  “To get out (something)” means to go into your bag or into your desk and rem ove it.  In this case, you’re supposed to get out your textbook.  Your “textbook”  is a book used in school about a particular subject.  It could be history, i t could be biology, it could be English, those could all have textbooks. 

Then I say, “Charlie,” one of my not too bright stu dents, “Charlie, eyes on your own book.”  “Eyes (eyes) on” is a phrase we use whe n someone is looking at someone else’s book or someone else’s homework perh aps or someone else’s test when they shouldn’t be.  “Eyes on your own boo k” would mean stop looking at something else and pay attention to your book, i n this case.  You could say, “eyes on the screen,” meaning everyone let’s watch what is on the television or on the movie screen. 

“Kathy,” I say, “do you have something to share wit h the rest of the class?” Kathy is talking to someone else when she’s not sup posed to.  So one thing that teachers sometimes do to get students to shut up – to be quiet is to ask them if they have something to share with the rest of the c lass.  “To share” means to tell other people, to say to other people.  What the tea cher is saying here is you shouldn’t be talking, and if you’re going to talk t hen you’re going to have to tell everyone about what you are talking about in your p rivate conversation.  So it’s another way of telling Kathy just to shut up, to be  quiet.  “Shut up” is a little rude; it’s not something you want to say to someone unles s you’re angry with them. Well, you shouldn’t say it when you’re angry either , but anyway.  I then say to Kathy, who’s not a very good student because she’s not paying attention, I say, “No?  Then put that away until recess.”  So perhaps  Kathy is texting or playing a video game or perhaps she’s passing a note to her f riend.  But I tell her to put that away – meaning get it away from where you are now, put it in your pocket or your purse – until recess.  “Recess” (recess) is a break that you have in school when the kids – the children usually go outside and  they play for 15 minutes or 20 minutes in between your classes.  When I was in school we had, I think, one recess break in the morning, so that for 15 or 20 m inutes all the students would  

go outside if it wasn’t too cold, and walk around a nd play a game or smoke a cigarette – you know, what…what elementary school c hildren do!   

Well, back to my class here.  I now say, “does anyo ne know the answer to this question I’ve written on the board?”  “The board” ( board) is the chalkboard, at least it was when I was in school.  It’s a board th at you can write things on with a piece of chalk.  Usually the chalk is white and the  board is black, that’s why we call it a “blackboard.”  Now, we have what are call ed “whiteboards,” which are white pieces of plastic that you use colored marker s on to write, but when I was going to school it was just the chalkboard.  So in the story here, I’m asking if the students know the answer to the question I wrote on  the board.  Then I say, “Don’t everybody speak at once.”  This is a joke th at a teacher might make when no one raises their hand.  No one says they know th e answer, or indicates they know their answer by putting their hand up in the a ir.  We call that “raising your hand.”  I say, “Don’t everybody speak at once.”  “A t once” means at the same time.  Of course no one is speaking, so I’m joking here; I’m reminding them that they don’t know the answer because they’re not very  bright, my students.  I say, “Raise your hand if you have an answer.”  Then I sa y to another student, “Patrick, wait your turn.”  “To wait your turn” mea ns that you have to wait for someone else who is before you.  You’re going to do  things in order; in this case, in the order that people raised their hand.  So fir st Therese raised her hand, so she gets to answer first.  Then Patrick, who raised  his hand second, can speak. So I tell Patrick to wait his turn.  But remember n one of my students are very intelligent, so Therese will probably get the wrong  answer and so will Patrick! 

Then I say to two more students, “Michael and Steph en, no talking in the back of the classroom.”  Michael and Stephen are talking wh en they should not be, because they’re bad students, and I tell them they should stop talking.  “No talking in the back of the classroom.”  They’re sit ting very far from the teacher, way in the back of the room.  Then I say, “Tim, sit  still and eyes forward.”  Tim, another student, is probably moving around in his c hair.  I tell him to sit still, meaning don’t move.  “Eyes forward” means you shoul d be looking straight ahead at me, the teacher, or at the blackboard, not  around at all the other students.  I tell him to pay attention.  “Pay atten tion” means listen to what I am saying; watch me, not someone else.  Then I say to Mark, “Mark, are you paying attention?  I just called on you.”  “To call on (so meone)” in a classroom means to say someone’s name so they can give an answer to a question; they’re expected to talk.  When I call on you, I’m going to ask you the capitals of the United States and you have to tell me what they are, all 50 of th em.  That’s to call on someone.   

Then I say, “Duane and Frank, I don’t see you two j otting down the assignment for tomorrow.”  “To jot (jot) down” means to write down, usually write down  

something on a piece of paper quickly.  I tell Duan e and Frank, two more of my bad students, that they’re not jotting down the ass ignment for tomorrow.  An “assignment” in this case is homework, but it could  be anything that your boss or your teacher tells you have to do.  In this case, i t’s “homework,” things you’re supposed to do for tomorrow’s class. 

Then I say, “Okay, everybody, read silently at your  desks for the next 10 minutes.”  “To read silently” means to read somethi ng and not talk – not talk to anyone else. 

I end my story by saying, “I always forget how exha usting it is to manage a classroom full of students.”  “To be exhausting” me ans to be very tiring, something that makes you tired because it’s so diff icult, it takes so much energy. And, managing a classroom, especially a classroom o f not very intelligent or well- behaved students, students who are always talking o r doing things they should not be doing like the students in my story, can be very exhausting. 

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of story] 

After three months of summer vacation, I was lookin g forward to the start of a new school year. … 

Okay, everybody, settle down.  Take your seats and get out your textbook.   

Charlie, eyes on your own book.  And Kathy, do you have something to share with the rest of the class?  No?  Then put that awa y until recess.   

Now, does anyone know the answer to this question I ’ve written on the board? Don’t everybody speak at once.  Raise your hand if you have an answer. Patrick, wait your turn.  Therese raised her hand f irst. 

Michael and Stephen, no talking in the back of the classroom.  Tim, sit still and eyes forward.  Pay attention.  Mark, are you paying  attention?  I just called on you.   

Duane and Frank, I don’t see you two jotting down t he assignment for tomorrow. 

Okay, everybody, read silently at your desks for th e next 10 minutes. …  

 I always forget how exhausting it is to manage a cl assroom full of students.  How many months is it before our next summer vacation?
