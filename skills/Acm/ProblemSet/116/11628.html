<h1>Problem A: Another lottery</h1>
</center>
<p>
Even in times of an economic crisis, people in Byteland still like to participate in lotteries. With a bit of luck, they might get rid of all their sorrows and become rich.
</p>
<p>The most popular lottery in Byteland consists of <b><i>m</i></b> rounds. In each round, everyone can purchase as many tickets as he wishes, and among all tickets sold in this round, one ticket is chosen randomly, each one with the same probability. The owner of that ticket wins the prize money of this round. Since people in Byteland like powers of 2, the prize money for the winner of round <b><i>i</i></b> amounts to <b><i>2<sup>i</sup></i></b>  Bytelandian Dollars.
</p>
<p>Can you determine for each participant in the lottery the probability that he will win more money than anybody else?
