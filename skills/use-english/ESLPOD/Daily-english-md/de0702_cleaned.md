Our episode begins with the person in the story, no t me, talking about how he’s tired of being single.  “To be single” means not to  be married or dating anyone, not involved in a romantic relationship.  I am marr ied, “happily married” we’d say, so this isn’t me, but the person in the story says that all of his friends had paired up.  “To pair (pair) up” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning to become involved in a romantic relationship, to no longer be single.  T he person in the story was left hanging.  “To be left hanging” means to remain want ing to do something or have something but you don’t have it; other people have it, but you don’t.  So, everyone in your group gets a ticket but you don’t;  you’re left hanging, you are the one who doesn’t get what everyone else gets.  H e says that like everybody else these days (nowadays; during this time), “I tr ied using the Internet to find other singles, but I never had any luck.  Cruising for my ideal woman,” he says, “among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for  a needle in a haystack.”  “To cruise (cruise) for women” is a term that used to m ean only you were looking to find women for a sexual relationship.  It, here, is  used a little more broadly, a little more generally, to mean trying to find a woman who will be your new romantic partner.  You could go to a bar or a disco – do we still call them discos?  A dance club, I guess we call them.  I guess I’m really old , calling them discos! Uh…anyway, going to places where young, single wome n might be, and trying to find one of them, and hope that one of them becomes  a romantic partner. 

The person in the story, who really needs a name do n’t you think?  Let’s call him Bill.  Bill is saying that he doesn’t want to cruis e for his “ideal” or perfect woman among a bunch of lonely hearts.  The term “lonely” means alone, by yourself; “lonely hearts” refers to people who are single, bu t they feel alone and they want to find a romantic partner.  They’re not happy bein g single.  “Lonely hearts” is a old term, but it’s still used.   

He thinks, Bill, that cruising for ideal women on t he Internet was like looking for needles in a haystack.  The expression “to find a n eedle (needle) in a haystack” means to find something very difficult, something t hat’s very difficult to find because it isn’t very common, it’s very rare.  A “n eedle” is a small piece of metal you use, for example, for sewing, when you are repa iring a piece of clothing.  Or, a “needle” is also what we call the thing the docto r puts in you to give you some medicine; they stick the sharp, thin, long needle i nto your arm, or somewhere else, and they are able to give you the medicine th at way.  So, a “needle” is very small, very thin, very difficult to find.  A “hayst ack” is a large pile of hay.  “Hay” is dry grass or other kinds of plants that you will fi nd usually on a farm.  The hay is all put on top of each other, and, of course, to tr y to find a needle, if you put it into the haystack, would be almost impossible.  So that’ s the expression, “to find a needle in a haystack.”   

So, what Bill is saying is that cruising for his id eal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a hay stack; it’s almost impossible.  He says, “I needed another strategy,” I needed another  plan, another approach.  “I finally hit on a brilliant idea.”  “To hit on (some thing)” here means to find someone, to discover something, or to realize somet hing.  Usually it’s used when talking about an idea or a solution to a problem.  Ironically, there’s another meaning of “hit on,” which is when a man or a woman  tries to get another man or a woman interested in them romantically.  They star t talking to them and smiling at them and making jokes.  This could be a way of h itting on a woman.  But here, we’re not talking about that informal use of the ex pression; this is a phrasal verb meaning to suddenly find a new idea or a solution t o a problem.  Bill says, “I would find places where women – single women natura lly (or normally) congregate and simply show up.”  “To congregate” is  when a group of people come together.  We talk about the members of, for e xample, a church as a “congregation,” they all come together; they all me et at a certain place.   

Bill is going to try to find places where single wo men would go, and he will then simply show up.  “To show up” is a phrasal verb mea ning to go somewhere without plans, without making special arrangements,  often without getting the permission of the people who are there.  They don’t  know you’re going to be there; suddenly you “show up,” you arrive, you appe ar.  It doesn’t always have to be unplanned; you could say, “I went to the café to  meet a woman I found on the Internet, but she never showed up.”  Actually, it w asn’t a woman, it was a man; you just didn’t realize it because it was the Inter net.  You see, you got to be careful!   

Anyway, this is Bill’s great idea.  He says that it  may turn out – it may result that this is a wild goose chase, but he was willing to g ive it a shot.  The expression “wild goose (goose) chase” (chase) means to try to do something that you are not successful in doing because it is difficult or impossible or was a bad idea or strategy to begin with.  In other words, you never should have tried to do it; it was an impossible task.  A “goose” is, you may know, a kind of bird.  Bill says that he was willing, however, to give it a shot.  The expre ssion “to give (something) a shot” means to try to do something even when you kn ow you probably will not be successful, or when you don’t expect to succeed or to do it.  He says that he decided to take a jewelry-making class.  “Jewelry” is like rings and necklaces, things that you would wear.  He’s taking a class on  how to make your own jewelry, and he says that since women love jewelry this is a great place for him to find single women, and therefore to try to find his  ideal woman. 

He arrives at the class a few minutes after it star ts so he could make a grand entrance.  “To make a grand entrance” is to enter a  room at a certain time or in a  

certain way so that everyone notices you.  This is true if you are going into a room where there are a lot of people; you will do s omething so that everyone knows that you are in the room or that you are comi ng into the room.  Bill says when he walked in, however, he got the shock of his  life.  “The shock of your life” is some very unexpected, powerful surprise, somethi ng that surprises you in a big way.  He says that the room was full of single women all right, meaning it was definitely full of single women.  The expression “a ll right” (two words) is used to emphasize that something is true or correct.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additionally uses of this term or based on  this term.  So Bill is saying yes, there were a lot of single women there, but no ne of them was under, or less than, the age of 70; they were all 70 years old or more.   

He says they were definitely glad to see him.  He e ven received, or got, a couple of invitations to dinner; the women asked him to go  to dinner with them.  He says, “But to be honest, that wasn’t the kind of dinner d ate I had been looking for!”  A “dinner date” is an invitation to eat dinner with a nother person, often hoping that this will be something that will begin a romantic r elationship or make your romantic relationship stronger.  Obviously, Bill wa s not interested in dating women over the age of 70! 

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of story] 

I was tired of being single.  All of my friends had  paired up and I was left hanging. Like everybody else these days, I tried using the I nternet to find other singles, but I never had any luck.  Cruising for my ideal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a haystack.  I needed another strategy. 

I finally hit on a brilliant idea.  I would find pl aces where single women naturally congregate and simply show up.  It may turn out to be a wild goose chase, but I was willing to give it a shot.   

That’s how I decided to take a jewelry-making class  at the community center.  I may not know much, but I do know that two things th at naturally go together are women and jewelry.   

I got to the class a few minutes late so I could ma ke a grand entrance.  But when I walked in, I got the shock of my life.  The room was full of single women all right, but not one of them was under the age of 70!    

They were definitely glad to see me.  I even receiv ed a couple of invitations to dinner that day.  But to be honest, that wasn’t the  kind of dinner date I had been looking for!
