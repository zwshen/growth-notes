<H1 align="center">Password Search</H1>

<P align="justify">
Being able to send encoded messages during World War II was very
important to the Allies. The messages were always 
sent after being encoded with a known password. Having a fixed
password was of course insecure, thus there was a need to change it
frequently. However, a mechanism was necessary to send the new
password. One of the mathematicians working in the cryptographic team
had a clever idea that was to send the password hidden within the
message itself. The interesting point was that the receiver of the
message only had to know the size of the password and then search for
the password within the received text. 

<P align="justify">
A password with size N can be
found by searching the text for the most frequent substring with N
characters. After finding the password, all the substrings that
coincide with the password are removed from the encoded text. Now, the
password can be used to decode the message. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>
Your mission has been
simplified as you are only requested to write a program that, given
the size of the password and the encoded message, determines the
password following the strategy given above. 

<P align="justify">
To illustrate your task,
consider the following example in which the password size is three
(N=3) and the text message is just <tt>baababacb</tt>. The password would
then be <tt>aba</tt> because this is the substring with size 3 that appears
most often in the whole text (it appears twice) while the other six
different substrings appear only once (<tt>baa</tt> ; <tt>aab</tt> ;
<tt>bab</tt> ; <tt>bac</tt> ; <tt>acb</tt>). 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
The input file contains several test cases, each of them consists of one line with the size of the
password, 0 < N &le; 10, followed by the text representing the
encoded message. To simplify things, you can assume that the text only
includes lower case letters. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
For each test case, your program should print as output a line with the password string.
