[start of dialogue]

Daniel: You look like you’re sitting on pins and ne edles.

Muriel: I am. I’m waiting to hear if our goods have  cleared customs yet. We’re in big trouble if our 50 crates aren’t released soon.

Daniel: You’ve filled out the proper paperwork. Wha t could go wrong?

Muriel: You have no idea how much red tape there is  when importing goods to the U.S. There are all kinds of rules to follow, an d we have to pay the correct tariffs.

Daniel: But I thought we had a free-trade agreement  with Niebuhrland. All goods imported from and exported to Niebuhrland should be  duty-free.

Muriel: Most things are duty-free, but not everythi ng. There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax rate varies depending on the type of sp irits. It’s all very confusing.

Daniel: Well, sitting here fretting won’t do any go od.

Muriel: If only I had access to those 50 crates of spirits . . .

Daniel begins our dialogue by saying, “You look lik e you’re sitting on pins and needles.” Daniel is talking to Muriel. The expressi on “to be sitting on pins (pins) and needles (needles)” means to be very nervous, to  be worried, to be anxious,

especially while you’re waiting for something to ha ppen. If you’ve taken an important examination and you’re waiting for the re sults, you could say that you are “sitting on pins and needles.”

Pins and needles are sharp objects, and obviously i f you were sitting on a sharp object, it would be very painful. So, waiting for n ews – being worried about something that may happen – can be a little painful . That’s what the expression here means, “sitting on pins and needles.” Muriel s ays, “I am.” I am, basically, anxious or worried. “I’m waiting to hear if our goo ds have cleared customs yet.” “Goods” is a general word meaning “products,” thing s that you make.

We usually distinguish “goods” from “services,” thi ngs that you do for people. So, a lawyer provides a “service,” and a store may prov ide a “good.” You buy some milk from the grocery store – that’s a “good.” You ask a lawyer to help you with some legal issue – that’s a “service.” Muriel is “w aiting to hear” – that is, waiting to find out – “if our goods have cleared customs ye t.” “Customs” (customs) here means the process that a country has for checking t o make sure that things that are brought into the country are legal and, dependi ng on the item, have been assessed a tax.

When you bring things into a country, the country w ill often have taxes that you have to pay to bring that item into the country, es pecially if you’re going to sell it in the country. So, when you import – when you brin g things into a country – here in the United States, you may have to pay certain t axes when you bring the items into the country, and the place where you pay those  taxes, the office that takes care of that for the U.S. government, is called “cu stoms.”

The opposite of “import” is “export” (export). That  means to send things to another country. But here we’re talking about impor ting goods into the United States. Muriel says, “We’re in big trouble if our 5 0 crates aren’t released soon.” A “crate” (crate) is a large, usually wooden containe r that typically has holes in it. We often use crates when we are transporting food s uch as fruit and vegetables. “To be released” means to be let go. In this case, it means that the crates are with the customs office, and you are waiting for the customs office to let you pick them up – take them away.

Daniel says, “You’ve filled out the proper paperwor k. What could go wrong?” “Paperwork” is a general term referring to document s that you have to complete, forms that you have to fill out in order to get som ething done. The government – all governments – require lots of paperwork. You ha ve to fill out this form, and then you have to give them this document, and so fo rth.

Muriel says, “You have no idea how much red tape th ere is when importing goods to the U.S.” The term “red tape” refers to di fficult rules or requirements, usually by the government, that you must follow in order to do something. “Red tape” could involve regulations and rules. It could  also involve filling out lots of forms – that is, a lot of paperwork.

You may wonder why we call it “red tape.” The answe r is that the expression was originally used in England. The British government,  when it had official papers, official documents to send, would tie them up with this red tape, and you had to untie the tape in order to read the documents and t hen tie them back up and send them to the next place. So, eventually this ex pression became a way of indicating useless and needless delays when it took  too long for something to happen, and that’s how it is used today to talk abo ut government regulations and rules that take a lot of time but don’t seem very n ecessary. They don’t seem useful.

Muriel says, “There’s a lot of red tape when you are importing,” or bringing into the country, “goods.” She says, “There are all kind s of rules to follow, and we have to pay the correct tariffs.” A “tariff” (tarif f) is what we call that special tax you have to pay when you bring things into a country. T he tariffs have to be paid before you are allowed to bring things in, before y ou are allowed to take them and sell them. Daniel says, “But I thought we had a  free-trade agreement with Niebuhrland?” Niebuhrland is not a real place, alth ough I do know someone named Niebuhr.

“Free-trade agreements” are treaties – agreements b etween countries that allow businesses in each of those countries to sell their  products without having to pay tariffs. Here in North America, we have something c alled NAFTA, the “North American Free Trade Agreement,” which is supposed t o allow businesses in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico to sell to customers i n those three countries without having to pay a lot of special tariffs. Of course, it usually doesn’t work out exactly that way. There are usually exceptions to a ny sort of free-trade agreement, but that’s the general idea.

Daniel continues, “All goods imported from and expo rted to Niebuhrland should be duty-free.” We already talked about the meaning of the verb “to export.” The term “duty (duty) free” means that you don’t have t o pay any taxes or tariffs. In many countries, at the airport, if you are travelin g internationally, if you are leaving the country, there will be a “duty-free sho p,” a place where you can buy expensive things – watches, alcohol, and so forth –  without paying the local taxes. That’s a duty-free shop. Well, being able to  import and export duty-free

means you don’t have to pay any special taxes as a business. You don’t have to pay any tariffs.

Muriel says, “Most things are duty-free, but not ev erything. There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax rate varies depending on the t ype of spirits. It’s all very confusing.” “Spirits” (spirits) here refers to alco hol. It’s sort of an older word, but you will still see it, especially when you’re talki ng about tariffs and taxes. Muriel says, “There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax ra te varies.” The “tax rate” is the amount, or percentage of the price of the good, tha t you have to pay to the government. “Varies” means it changes. In this case , it changes depending on the type of alcohol, the type of spirits.

Daniel says, “Well, sitting here fretting won’t do any good.” “To fret” (fret) means to worry about something, especially something that  you don’t have any control over. Of course, if you can’t control something, th ere’s no reason to worry about it, but we all do. We all fret over things that we can’t control.

Muriel says, “If only I had access to those 50 crat es of spirits.” “To have access to” means to be able to reach them. Muriel is makin g a joke here. She’s saying that if she had access to the alcohol, then she wou ldn’t have to worry as much because she could drink the alcohol. That’s the gen eral idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
