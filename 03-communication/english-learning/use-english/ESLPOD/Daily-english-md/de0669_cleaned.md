This episode is called “Making Controversial Comments.”  It is a dialogue between Vivian and William using a lot of vocabulary that would describe comments or remarks – things that you say – that would make other people angry.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Vivian:  That news commentator should be fired for making such inflammatory comments.  At least I won’t watch this show again until she is.  William:  As usual, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.  She was just expressing her opinion, albeit a controversial one.  Vivian:  Her opinion is offensive.  Mark my words: Before the end of the week, a lot of people will be up in arms calling for her head on a platter.  William:  I doubt it.  It’ll all blow over.  It’s just a tempest in a teapot.    Vivian:  No way.  She’ll never get away with it.    William:  Oh, yeah?  Vivian:  Yeah.  William:  Do you want to make a bet?    Vivian:  Sure, I’ll take that bet.  What does the winner get?  William:  Just the pleasure of seeing the other person eat her words.
