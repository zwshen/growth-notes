This episode is called “Trademarks and Logos.”  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca:  Look at this logo I designed for our new l ine of products.

Vien:  That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo.  In fact, it’s almost identical.

Bianca:  No, it’s not.  The color is a different sh ade of green, the graphic is smaller, and instead of a picture of a woman, I’m u sing a picture of a man. They’re nothing alike.

Vien:  That’s not what most people would say.  Look ing at your logo and our competitor’s logo side by side, I’d say this was a clear case of trademark infringement.

Bianca:  Okay, to be honest, I purposely made them look a little alike so that customers will associate our products with their br and.  So what?  I don’t think that’s a big deal.

Vien:  Our competitor has exclusive rights to use i ts logo.  If ours is too similar, the trademark registry and the courts are going to nail us.

Bianca:  So what do you want me to do?

Vien:  Go back to the drawing board – literally!

Bianca begins by saying, “Look at this logo I desig ned for our new line of products.”  A “logo” (logo) is the image used to id entify a company or an organization.  It’s usually what goes above or belo w their name; it’s a special symbol that you recognize that company from.  The s ymbol – the logo for Apple Computer is an apple that has a small bite taken ou t of it.  The logo that Bianca designed is for their new line of products.  A “lin e of products” are a set of related things.  You could have a line of products for shoe s; there would be a number of different kinds or styles of shoes.  “To design” me ans to create some sort of image or shape or style of something.  The person w ho creates the logo – who designs the logo is called a “designer.”

Vien says, “That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo.”  Vien is saying that he likes the logo, but it looks like so meone else’s logo, their competitor’s.  A “competitor” (competitor) is a com pany that sells products or services similar to the ones that your company sell s, so the two companies are “competing,” they are trying to get the same custom ers.  Coke and Pepsi are competitors in the world of soft drinks – of sodas.   Vien says, “In fact, (the logo you designed Bianca) is almost identical.”  Somethi ng that is “identical” is the same as something else, there are no differences be tween them.  We talk about identical twins, two boys or two girls that are bor n at the same time, from the same mother, who look exactly alike.  I have two ol der brothers who are identical twins.  One of them is named Mark and the other one  is named Mike, but I don’t know who is who; I still can’t tell them apart.  Th at is, I don’t know which one is Mark and which one is Mike.  Maybe someday!

So, Vien is saying that this logo that Bianca desig ned is almost identical with their competitor’s.  Bianca says, “No, it’s not.  The col or is a different shade of green.” A “shade” is a slight difference in a color; colors  have different shades, small differences.  She says that the logo she designed h as a different shade of green. “The graphic,” she says, “is smaller.”  The “graphi c” is the image, especially an image that is created by a computer.  Often, the wo rd “graphic” is used to describe something that doesn’t have any text – any  lettering, any words on it. She says, “instead of a picture of a woman, I’m usi ng a picture of a man.  They’re nothing alike.”  When we say some things are “nothi ng alike,” we mean they are completely different; they are not similar in any w ay.

Vien says, “That’s not what most people would say,”  meaning if we showed your logo to people outside of our company most of them would say they are identical. Vien says, “Looking at your logo and our competitor ’s logo side by side, I’d say this was a clear case of trademark infringement.”  The expression “side by side” means two things are placed or put right next to ea ch other so that you can look at them and see how they are different and how they  are similar.  Vien is saying if

you take the new logo from Bianca and compare it to  the competitor’s logo, that it would be a case – a clear case of trademark infring ement.  “Trademarks” are official registrations that you make with the gover nment.  Usually a company, after it designs a logo or it has some sort of expr ession that it uses in its advertising, the company will get a trademark for i t.  They will ask the government to protect it so that no one else can co py it, no one else can use it. We at ESL Podcast have a trademark.  ESLPod, our we bsite, is trademarked; those six letters together are trademarked.  They a re protected by the U.S. government’s laws, and by extension, international laws.  “To infringe on (something)” means to violate or to break some sort  of rule or law.  So, when we talk about “trademark infringement,” we’re talking about someone who uses illegally – without permission – someone else’s log o or graphic or phrase that the company has protected with their trademark.  Vien t hinks this is a clear case, or a clear example of trademark infringement.

Bianca says, “Okay, to be honest (if I’m telling the truth), I purposely made them look alike – a little alike,” she says, “so that cu stomers will associate our products with their brand.”  “To associate” means to connect  two things, to believe that two things are related.  “Associate” has other meanings  in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those.  Bianca wants their customers to associate their products, the things t hat they sell, with the other company’s brand.  A “brand” (brand) is the particul ar name and design of a company’s product.  For example, there are differen t brands of tennis shoes; different companies make different kinds of shoes.  One company may have several different brands, several different types t hat go by the same name and have a similar design – if it’s a big company, ofte n the company really has only one brand.  Bianca then says, “So what?” meaning wh o cares, this is not important.  She says, “I don’t think that’s a big d eal,” meaning I don’t think it’s important.

Vien says, “Our competitor has exclusive rights to use its logo.”  “Rights” are your legal abilities to do something.  “Exclusive rights ” are things that only you can do or your company can do.  If the company trademarks a logo, only that company can use the logo; they have exclusive rights, no on e else can use them.  Vien says, “If ours is too similar, the trademark regist ry and the courts are going to nail us.”  The “trademark registry” is the official list  of all of the government registered trademarks; you can go to a website nowadays and lo ok for those.  The “courts” refer to the legal institutions in a country.  “The  courts,” Vien thinks, “are going to nail us (if our logo is too similar to the logo of our competitor’s).”  “To nail (someone)” is an informal expression that here mean s to get someone in trouble or to punish someone for having done something wron g.  If the professor sees

you cheating on an examination, he’s going to nail you; he’s going to get you in a lot of trouble.

Bianca says, “So what do you want me to do?”  Vien replies, “Go back to the drawing board – literally!”  “To go back to the dra wing board” is an expression that means to begin something again.  Now, a “drawi ng board” is where you would draw or design something.  But, the expressio n is normally used in any situation where you’re asking someone to start a pr oject from the beginning, to do it over usually because they’ve done it wrong or  they don’t have a very good idea.  In this case, Bianca actually was using a re al drawing board, and that’s why Vien says at the end of the expression “literal ly.”  “Literally” refers to the actual, direct meaning of words, not a symbolic mea ning of the word.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
