# Experiencing a Blackout

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 847: Experiencing a Blackout

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 847. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We have a website at eslpod.com. We have a Learning  Guide membership that you can get to support this podcast. Just go to our  website for more information.

This episode is a dialog between George and Inga ab out what happens when you don’t have any electrical power. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialog]

George:  Whoa, what happened?

Inga:  The lights went out. Did we blow a fuse, or is this a blackout?

George:  Well, I don’t see any lights on in any of the houses down the street. It’s pitch black out there.

Inga:  So it’s another power outage. Somehow the ci rcuits got overloaded again. I wonder how long we’ll have to do without electric ity this time.

George:  I wonder if it’s our power grid or if this  is a citywide blackout. All right, we’d better light a few candles. There’s no telling  how long this will last.

Inga:  No, it’s not like last summer when we had ro lling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat. Do you remember ho w we passed those hours of darkness?

George:  Yes, I do. What are you suggesting?

Inga:  I’m just saying that there’s no reason to wa ste a perfectly good blackout.

Our dialog begins with George saying, “Whoa. What h appened?” “Whoa,” usually spelled (whoa), is an expression of surprise. “What  happened?” George asks.

Inga says, “The lights went out,” meaning the elect ricity has stopped. There is no more electricity to the house or the building, or p erhaps, to the whole area where you’re living. Inga says, “Did we blow a fuse, or i s this a blackout?” “To blow (blow) a fuse (fuse)” means that you are using too much electricity at a certain part of your house. The “fuse” is something that pr otects your house, protects the things in your house if you try to get too much ele ctricity into a certain area.

Most houses nowadays don’t have fuses, which are li ttle devices, little things, little objects that you put into your electrical, w hat we call the “electrical panel” in the back of your house, wherever it is. Nowadays, t hey use things that are called “circuit breakers,” which are just basically switch es. “Fuses” are things that you actually have to take out and replace. In the house  I grew up in, many years ago, we had fuses. Now, the house I live in now has thes e new switches called “circuit breakers.”

Inga is asking if she and George have blown a fuse or if this is a “blackout.” A “blackout” (blackout) – one word – is when an entir e area, sometimes an entire city, loses power, loses electrical power. There is  no electricity available anywhere. “Blackout” could also be when you don’t r emember something after drinking a lot of alcohol. That’s also called a “bl ackout,” but here it means when you don’t have electrical power for a large area of  a city.

George says, “Well, I don’t see any lights on in an y of the houses down the street.” George goes out and looks to see if there’ s electricity in the other houses and he doesn’t see any. That means it’s probably a “blackout.” George says, “It’s pitch black out there.” The expression “pitch (pitc h) black” means extremely black, with no light whatsoever. Inga says, “So, it ’s another power outage.” A “power outage” (outage) is the same as a blackout. It’s a period of time when there is no electricity available.

Inga says, “Somehow, the circuits got overloaded ag ain.” A “circuit” (circuit) is a path that electricity follows between two points. I nga here is referring probably to the power plants – the place where the electricity is generated, that somehow their circuits got overloaded. “To be overloaded” m eans that there is too much demand, in this case, for electricity and the place  that is generating the electricity can’t produce it fast enough. And so, the circuits overload and nobody gets any power at all.

Inga says, “I wonder how long we’ll have to do with out electricity this time.” “To do without” means not to have. Electricity, you pro bably know, is power – energy that is carried through wires and cables, used to o perate almost everything that is in your house that’s a machine. Mostly, these are t hings that run on or are

powered by electricity. Except me -  I’m powered by  happiness! I’m powered by your emails, your positive feedback. That’s my powe r.

George says, “I wonder if it’s our power grid or if  this is a citywide blackout.” A “power grid” (grid) is a network of power companies  and users of electricity that are connected together. Power grids usually are ver y large. A “citywide blackout” would be a blackout that only affected one particul ar city - “citywide” (citywide) is one word, meaning across or covering an entire city .

George says, “All right, we’d better light a few ca ndles.” A “candle” (candle) is a small object, usually made of wax that has somethin g that you can light so that it burns. We call it a “wick” (wick). It’s basically a  piece of string that burns in the center of the wax and provides light. Many restaura nts have candles at night. It’s considered, perhaps, romantic. You may have candles  in your house. But George isn’t trying to be romantic here; at least, I don’t think he is. He instead, wants to get some candles so they have some light. George says, “There’s no telling how long this will last.” The expression “T here’s no telling” is used to mean that it’s impossible to know what will happen or wh en it will happen. There’s no telling how many beautiful women will be waiting for George Clooney or Brad Pitt to get their autographs, their signatures - there’s  no telling – could be hundreds, could be thousands, I don’t know.

Inga says, “No, it’s not like last summer when we h ad rolling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat.” A “rolling  (rolling) blackout” is when the power company decides to stop giving power to diffe rent areas. First one area, then another area, then another area, so that they’ re able to continue generating or producing enough power at least, for everyone for a certain amount of time, but not for everyone for the entire time. Instead o f just one part of the city not having power, they do a rolling blackout where they  give one part of the city power for four hours, let’s say, and another part o f the city power for four hours and so forth.

A “surge” (surge) is a sudden increase in something  that usually only lasts for a short time. Surge has a couple of different meaning s in English, however. Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ones  of those. Inga is saying that last summer there was surge in demand due to the he at. In other words, because it was so hot, more people were using the air condi tioners to keep themselves cool. This caused an increase in the demand for ele ctricity – a surge in the demand, and because of that sudden increase, the po wer company didn’t have enough power for all the different parts of the cit y. This happens occasionally. It happened in California, I remember, oh, maybe seven , ten years ago. It was

happening quite a bit, maybe longer. It hasn’t happ ened very recently here, but it still does happen in other cities.

Inga says, “Do you remember how we passed those hou rs of darkness?” She’s asking George if he remembers what they did last su mmer during the rolling blackouts, when they did not have electricity. That ’s what she means by “those hours of darkness” without light. George says, “Yes  I do. What are you suggesting?” Inga says, “I’m just saying that there ’s no reason to waste a perfectly a good blackout.” “Perfectly” here means completely. It’s a word used for emphasis here. It’s often used before the adjec tive “good.” “It’s a perfectly good sweater.” “It’s a perfectly good car.” You’re saying that there’s nothing wrong with it. Inga, however, is suggesting that sh e and her husband George can take advantage of this blackout, somehow - perhaps of course, in some romantic way.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
