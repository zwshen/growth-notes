This dialogue is between Adrian and Paul about watc hing two men fight. Sounds fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adrian: Hey, there’s a fight going on outside. Let’ s go!

Paul: Those guys are really going at it.

Adrian: Yeah, they’re going all out. Did you see th at? He just sucker punched the other guy.

Paul: They’re not really fighting fair, are they?

Adrian: No, this is a knock-down, drag-out fight – the best kind! Deck him!

Paul: I don’t really want to watch these guys pumme ling each other. Want to go?

Adrian: Are you kidding?! This is the best entertai nment I’ve seen in months. Nice uppercut, but watch out for the other guy’s ja b. Oh, he just took a bad blow to the head.

Paul: This is getting ugly. Next we’ll get hair pul ling.

Adrian: Oh, did you see that head-butt? I think we have a knockout.

Paul: Okay, if that’s true, then the fight is over.  Can we leave now?

Adrian: Wait! The guy is getting up. I think we mig ht get a second round. Hey, where are you going? You don’t have the stomach for  a little fight?

Paul: It’s not the fight. What I can’t stomach is b eing around someone who is as bloodthirsty as you are!

[end of dialogue]

Adrian begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “Hey,  there’s a fight going on outside.” A “fight” is when two people try to hurt each other, often by hitting each other. You can have a fight that is just “verbal” ( verbal). That’s when two people are often yelling at each other, disagreeing with e ach other but not hitting each other. When they start to hit each other, we would call that a “physical fight.”

Paul says, “Those guys are really going at it.” The  expression “to go at it” means to be completely involved in something with a lot of enthusiasm. Adrian says, “Yeah, they’re going all out.” “To go all out” mean s to do something without hesitation or limitation, to do something fully, of ten in a somewhat extreme way. “To go at it” and “to go all out” could describe the same situation, as it does here. The meanings are slightly different. “To go at it” means to begin something with a lot of enthusiasm. “To go all out” means to do the most you possibly can. So they’re slightly different in meaning.

In any case, Adrian then says to Paul, “Did you see  that?” indicating something that just happened during the fight, apparently, wh ere these two men are hitting each other. Adrian says, “He just sucker punched the other guy.” “To sucker (sucker) punch (punch)” someone is to hit someone w hen he is not expecting it, in a somewhat unfair way, I guess we would say. The  verb “to punch” means to hit someone with your closed hand, what we would ca ll your “fist” (fist). In fact, there’s a way of describing a fight such as the one  in the dialogue which is a “fistfight,” when two people hit each other mostly with their closed hands, their fists.

After Adrian comments on one guy sucker punching the other, Paul says, “They’re not really fighting fair, are they?” “To f ight fair” (fair) means to agree to fight in a way that is somehow following certain ru les. It may seem a little strange to talk about “fighting fair,” but when people figh t in a boxing match, there are definitely rules for things you can do and not do w hen you are fighting the other person. When two men are angry with each other and start hitting each other,

most people don’t think about rules that might gove rn or be applicable to the fight.

Adrian says, “No,” meaning no, they’re not fighting  fair. “This is a knock-down, drag-out fight.” “The expression “knock (knock) – d own, drag (drag) – out” refers to a kind of fighting where everything is acceptabl e. There are no rules. There are no restrictions. Adrian appears to really be en joying this fight. She calls a knock-down, drag-out fight “the best kind.” Then sh e yells at the men, or at one of them, “Deck him!” “To deck” (deck) someone is an  informal way of saying to punch or hit someone very hard, often so hard that the person falls down on the ground.

Paul says, “I don’t really want to watch these guys  pummeling each other.” “To pummel” (pummel) is to punch or hit someone many ti mes repeatedly with your fist. Paul says to Adrian, “Want to go?” Adrian say s, “Are you kidding?!” She, of course, doesn’t want to go. She says, “This is the best entertainment I’ve seen in months.” Then she goes back to watching the fight a nd starts to comment on how the two men are fighting each other. She says, “Nice uppercut.” An “uppercut (uppercut)”  is a kind of punch that is used in boxing or in a fistfight like this, where y ou use your arm to hit the other man’s face by bringing your fist from down below wh ere your, say, waist is and up into the face. So you are hitting the face from down below. That’s an “uppercut.” Another kind of punch or way of hitting  someone is called a “jab” (jab). A jab is a very quick hit with your fist. Yo u move your arm in and out very quickly when you hit the or try to hit the face of the person you’re fighting.

“Oh,” Adrian says, “he just took a bad blow to the head.” A “blow” (blow) here refers to a strong hit, a strong punch. A “blow to the head” means that the other fighter has hit him in the head hard. Paul then com ments, “This is getting ugly.” The expression “to get ugly” (ugly) means that the situation is becoming worse. It’s becoming very unpleasant. If you describe some thing as “getting ugly,” you mean that it’s getting to be very serious in a bad way and in a very unpleasant, not nice way.

Paul says, “Next we’ll get,” meaning we will see in  this fight, “hair pulling.” “To pull someone’s hair” means, of course, to take your  hand and to grab the hair on the head of the person and pull it. This is very di fficult if you fight me. You won’t be able to pull my hair. So, I have that advantage.

Anyway, Adrian says, “Oh, did you see that head-but t?” A “head” (head) is what you have on top of your body where your brain is su pposed to be – although not everyone has a brain in their head, such as one of my neighbors, for example.

“To butt” (butt) means to hit something hard. So a “head-butt” would be to hit someone hard with the top of your head or the front  of your head. In the game of soccer, what the rest of the world calls “football, ” you can have a head-butt by hitting the ball with your head – or at least, I th ink that’s possible.

Adrian finishes her commentary by saying, “I think we have a knockout.” A “knockout” (knockout) is when a fight ends when one  of the two people fighting falls on the ground and doesn’t get up. Paul says, “Okay, if that’s true then the fight is over. Can we leave now?” Adrian says, “Wai t! The guy is getting up,” meaning the guy was knocked onto the floor, he fell  down onto the floor, but now he’s getting up. “I think we may have a second roun d,” she says.

In a boxing match, where two men (or two women nowa days) wear special gloves on their hands and hit each other following certain rules, there are different parts of the fight, and those parts of the fight are called “rounds.” A “round” is a certain number of minutes during which  the two fighters hit each other, and then they stop and they take a break for  a short amount of time and then they start fighting again, and each one of tho se divisions or parts of the fight is called a “round” (round).

“Hey,” Adrian says, “where you going? You don’t hav e the stomach for a little fight?” she says. Paul is getting up and leaving an d Adrian wants to know if he “has the stomach (stomach) for” a fight. “To have t he stomach for” something is an expression we use to mean to have the ability to  tolerate a difficult situation or a situation that is unpleasant, uncomfortable, or m aybe even painful. Paul says, “It’s not the fight,” meaning he’s not bothered by the fight itself. “What I can’t stomach,” he says – what I can’t tolerate or what I  find too unpleasant – “is being around someone,” being close to someone, “who is as  bloodthirsty as you are!”

Paul’s problem is not with the fight but with Adria n, because he thinks she is “bloodthirsty” (bloodthirsty). “To be bloodthirsty”  means to enjoy violence, to like violence, to like seeing other people get hurt or p ossibly even to spill their blood – when you see blood because two people are hitting e ach other and you enjoy that. That’s what Paul’s problem is, and I think he ’s probably right.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Adrian: Hey, there’s a fight going on outside. Let’ s go!

Paul: Those guys are really going at it.

 Adrian: Yeah, they’re going all out. Did you see th at? He just sucker punched the other guy.
