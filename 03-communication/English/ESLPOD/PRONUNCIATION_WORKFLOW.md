# Pronunciation Practice Workflow

This document outlines a structured workflow for improving English pronunciation based on the key principles of phonetics and sentence-level practice.

## General Workflow

1.  **Identify Target Sounds (Phonemes):**
    *   Choose a specific English sound (phoneme) to focus on from the list of eight pronunciation points below.
    *   Create a dedicated markdown file for each sound (e.g., `practice/th_sound.md`).

2.  **Gather Practice Materials:**
    *   **Example Sentences:** Search through the `Daily-english-md` directory to find at least 10 example sentences that contain the target sound in a natural context.
    *   **Tongue Twisters:** Use web search to find 2-3 tongue twisters that specifically target the chosen sound.
    *   **Long Sentences:** Identify and collect around 50 long sentences from the transcripts or other sources for fluency, stress, and rhythm practice.

3.  **Daily Practice Routine (100-Day Plan):**
    *   Dedicate 1.5 to 3 hours daily to pronunciation practice.
    *   **Focus on one sound at a time:** Read the 10 example sentences and the tongue twisters for that sound.
    *   **Read Aloud:** Practice reading in a loud, clear voice. Focus on physical technique: keep the abdomen engaged and use breath support from the diaphragm, not the throat.
    *   **Long Sentence Practice:** Integrate the 50 long sentences into your daily routine. Read them repeatedly, focusing on the eight key pronunciation points, until you can say them smoothly and naturally. The goal is mastery through practice, not just memorization.

4.  **Review and Repeat:**
    *   Cycle through the different sounds and pronunciation points regularly.
    *   Record yourself to track your progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Eight Key Pronunciation Points

Here is the list of the eight core areas to focus on during your practice:

1.  **長音 (Long Vowels):** e.g., the "ee" in "see" or the "a" in "father".
2.  **短元音 (Short Vowels):** e.g., the "a" in "cat" or the "i" in "sit".
3.  **重讀 (Stress):** The emphasis placed on certain syllables in a word (e.g., **pro**-nounce vs. pro-nun-ci-**a**-tion) and on certain words in a sentence.
4.  **連讀 (Linking/Liaison):** The smooth connection of sounds between words, like "an apple" sounding like "anapple".
5.  **略音 (Elision):** The omission of a sound or syllable, like "I don't know" becoming "I dunno".
6.  **咬舌頭 (Tongue Biting - "th" sounds):** The correct pronunciation of voiced (`/ð/` in "this") and unvoiced (`/θ/` in "think") "th" sounds.
7.  **鼻音 (Nasal Sounds):** Sounds like /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/ (as in "sing").
8.  **變音 (Assimilation/Sound Changes):** How sounds can change when they are next to each other, like "handbag" often being pronounced "hambag".
