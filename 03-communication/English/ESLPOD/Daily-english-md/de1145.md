This episode is a dialogue about cooking. Hmm, make s me hungry. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gisela: That smells wonderful!

Danny: This is my family’s recipe. The secret is in  the combination of seasonings we use.

Gisela: I can see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.

Danny: To get a bold flavor, we use a lot of aromat ic seeds, barks, and roots.

Gisela: How much do you put in of each one?

Danny: Precise measurements aren’t really necessary . I put in a pinch of this and a dash of that. I add them to taste.

Gisela: So getting the recipe wouldn’t do me any go od, huh?

Danny: I’m afraid not. I learned how to make this i n my mother’s kitchen.

Gisela: Would you teach me if I volunteered to be y our apprentice, doing all of your prep work?

Danny: That depends.

Gisela: On what?

Danny: On how quick you are with this potato peeler .

Gisela says to Danny, “That smells wonderful! Danny  replies, “This is my family’s recipe.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written in structions about how to make a particular kind of food. Danny says, “The secret” –  that is, the secret to the success of this recipe – “is in the combination of seasonings we use.” “Seasonings” (seasonings) refers to things you put in food to give them a certain flavor.

There are lots of different things that could be co nsidered “seasonings.” Gisela tells us a little bit about those. She says, “I can  see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.” The most common kinds of seasonings are, in fact, “herbs and spices .” That’s why the title of this episode is “Using Herbs and Spices in Cooking.”

“Herbs” (herbs) – notice that in American English, the “H” is silent; you don’t pronounce it – are leaves or other green parts of a  plant that are used for seasoning food, to give food a certain flavor. You can also use herbs, or at least some people do, to make tea or even to make a kind of medicine, something to help you if you are sick. There are two different k inds of herbs. There are “dried herbs” and “fresh herbs.” Something that is “dried”  is something that has been, we would say “dehydrated,” meaning all the water ha s been removed from it.

“Fresh herbs,” then, would be plants or parts of pl ants that still have some water in them, that still look and feel like they did whe n they were in the ground growing. Dried herbs are herbs that don’t have any water in them and that you can put in a jar, in a container and use many weeks  or months later. Herbs always come from the leafy or green parts of a plan t. Some examples of herbs include oregano, thyme, basil, parsley, and rosemar y. Those are all common herbs used in cooking.

Another kind of seasoning for food is what is calle d a “spice” (spice). “Spices” also come from plants, but they come from the non-g reen and non-leafy part of the plant. In other words, any other part of the pl ant that isn’t the leaf or the green part and is used for seasoning is called a “spice.”  Examples of spices include cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and pepper. Tho se are all common spices. Spices are usually used after they are dried. That’ s the most common way of using spices in cooking.

 Gisela notes that Danny has “30 different dried and  fresh herbs and spices on this counter.” A “counter” (counter) in a kitchen i s a flat surface, a flat place where you can put your bowls and your ingredients f or your food. Danny says, “To get a bold flavor, we use lots of aromatic seed s, barks, and roots.” “Bold” (bold) means strong or forceful. If we have a “bold  flavor” (flavor), we have a taste that is very strong, a flavor that is very st rong.

Danny says they use a lot of “aromatic (aromatic) s eeds (seeds), barks (barks), and roots (roots).” “Aromatic” refers to something that has a very strong scent, a very strong but nice smell. The “seed” of a plant i s the small part that carries the necessary information in order to have a new plant come to life, a new plant to grow. That’s how plants typically reproduce themsel ves. Humans reproduce themselves in a slightly different way. I will not explain that to you here.

The term “bark” is usually associated with a tree –  the outermost layer of a tree. Something like a hard skin that goes around a tree.  That’s “bark.” “Roots” are the parts of the plants that are underneath the ground,  typically. “Roots,” “barks,” and “seeds” are all ways of getting spices – places in a plant, if you will, where spices come from. Gisela says, “How much do you put in eac h one?” How much of these seasonings, I’m guessing. Danny says, “Precis e measurements aren’t really necessary.”

Something that is “precise” (precise) is something that is exact – one tablespoon, one teaspoon, one ounce. Those are precise measures  of something. Danny says, however, that precise measurements aren’t nec essary. He says, “I put a pinch of this and a dash of that.” A “pinch” (pinch ) of something means a small amount of something. You’ll sometimes see that in a  recipe. It’ll say “a pinch of salt.” That means just a little bit of salt. Simila rly, you will see the word “dash” (dash) of some ingredient. “Dash” here also means a  small amount.

Usually, it refers to a small amount of something t hat is in a container, what we would call a “shaker” (shaker). If you have salt an d pepper in your kitchen, they are probably in what we would call, in English, “sh akers” – small containers that have holes on the top of them. A “dash of salt” wou ld be to take the salt shaker and maybe move it once over the food. A “pinch of s alt” would be to take some salt in your fingers and put it into the food. Ofte n, it can mean the same amount of salt. It’s just a different way of describing the manner or way in which you put the seasoning into the food.

Danny says, “I add them,” meaning the seasonings, “ to taste.” “To add something to taste” means to put it in and then to taste the food to see how it tastes and to

determine whether you need more of that ingredient.  Gisela says, “So getting the recipe wouldn’t do me any good, huh?” Danny says, “ I’m afraid not. Gisela is asking if she can get a copy of the recipe and then  cook the food herself. Danny says no, really, you can’t because he does so much to taste. You would have to know what the taste is in order to make this recipe  correctly. He says he learned how to make it “in his mother’s kitchen.”

Gisela says, “Would you teach me if I volunteered t o be your apprentice, doing all of your prep work?” An “apprentice” (apprentice) is  someone usually who is studying some sort of career, some sort of technica l career or trade – learning how to do it by watching someone else. There are ma ny different kinds of jobs were you learn most of what you need to know by bei ng an apprentice. Plumbing, carpentry, and in some ways being a chef are all things that are learned best by being an apprentice, by working wit h an expert – someone who already knows what he’s doing.

That’s what Gisela wants to do. She wants to “volun teer” – that is, not be paid – to be Danny’s apprentice. She’ll do all of his “pre p (prep) work.” “Prep” stands for “preparation. “Prep work” in a kitchen is doing all  the things that you have to do to get the ingredients ready. It may involve chopping up or slicing vegetables, getting meat or other kinds of protein prepared. Th ese are things you do before you put them all together in order to make the dish  that you are making, the food that you are making.

Danny answers Gisela’s question by saying, “That de pends.” Gisela says, “On what?” meaning what does it depend on? Danny says, “On how quick you are with this potato peeler.” Danny says he will give G isela a job if she’s good at using a potato peeler. A “potato peeler” (peeler) i s a small tool, almost like a knife, that is used to remove the skin from a potat o. A “potato” is a kind of plant that is usually white inside and is cooked in water  or using some sort of heat in order to make the inside of the plant soft in order  to eat it.

Potatoes can be eaten with or without the covering that goes around the potato. We call that covering the “skin” (skin), just like you have skin on your body. “Peeling potatoes,” means taking the skin off of the potato. It is often considered a very dull and uninteresting job. When I was growi ng up, I would often peel potatoes for my mother. I come from an Irish-Americ an family. Potatoes are a popular dish with Irish Americans because they were  popular (and still are) in Ireland, so it’s no surprise they continue to be po pular with Irish families living in the United States.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

We consider our dialogues to have bold flavors and wonderful seasoning. That’s because they’re written by the master cook of the E nglish language, our very own Dr. Lucy Tse.
