This episode is called “Wiring Money (or sending money el ectronically) to Another Country.”  It’s dialogue between Mahmoud and Sharon using a lot of vocabulary you would need to know in sending wires.  Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Mahmoud:  My brother emailed about an emergency situati on.  He needs $300 by tomorrow, but how can I get cash to him within 24 ho urs if I’m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York? 

Sharon:  That’s easy.  You can wire him the money from here and he can pick it up immediately there. 

Mahmoud:  You mean wi re him money through the bank?  I already checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to proce ss the wire.   

Sharon:  You can just use a private wire service like We stern Union and the money will be available to him immediately.  I wire m oney all the time using Western Union.  Here is a blank form.  I can help you fi ll it out if you want me to. 

Mahmoud:  That would be great.  Hey, this form is for a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire? 

Sharon:  Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the receive r or recipient information here and the sender information there. 

Mahmoud:  Can I pay in local currency?  I don’t have tha t much cash in U.S. dollars. 

 Sharon:  Sure.  When you go to the Western Union off ice, they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate. 

Mahmoud:  Is there a fee? 

Sharon:  Yeah, there is, and it’s a little higher if you want the money to be available immediately.  If you have more time, you could save a little by using the slower service that makes the money available in three busi ness days.  All done? 

Mahmoud:  Yeah, I think so.  Now what? 

Sharon:  Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office.  They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number.  Your brothe r can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office  in New York.   

Mahmoud:  Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.   

Sharon:  So, what’s the emergency? 

Mahmoud:  Tickets go on sale tomorrow for my favorite ba seball team.  My brother and I have to get tickets. 

Sharon:  That’s the emergency?! 

Mahmoud:  For us, it’s a matter of life and death. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Mahmoud saying, “My brother em ailed about an emergency situation.”  “Emergencies” are unexpected situati ons or events, things that require that you have an immediate response; you ha ve to take care of them right away because they are very serious or dangerous.  Mah moud says that his brother needs 300 dollars “by tomorrow,” meaning befor e the end of tomorrow. He asks, “how can I get cash to him within 24 hours if I’ m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?”  So our dialogue today is in Mexico Ci ty.  “Cash” is money that you put in your wallet or your purse.  It usually consists of either “coins,” round metal objects, or piece of paper we call “bills” ( bills).  The term is used more generally to mean money.   

Mahmoud is wondering how he can get this money to his br other in one day if they are in different cities.  Sharon says, “That’s easy.  You can wire him the  

 money from here and he can pick it up immediately there .”  “To wire” as a verb means to send something, usually money, electronically; it could also mean sending someone a message.  In the old days, we had tele graph messages that were sent electronically.  With the Internet and better  phone service we don’t do that very much.  I don’t think they do it all anymore; I  might be wrong about that. But nowadays the word is used to refer to sending money e lectronically either through a bank directly or through another private comp any such as Western Union, which we’ll talk about in a minute.  The word “wire” has several meanings in English, and those can be found in, of course, our Le arning Guide. 

So Sharon says that Mahmoud can wire his brother money.  Mahmoud says, “You mean wire him money through the bank?  I alrea dy checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to process the wire.”  “To process” is a general verb meaning to do all the necessary actions, oft en things that require what we would call “paperwork” – forms to fill out, p ermissions to get.  To process, for example, an application means that you look at  it, you give it to the appropriate people, they review it, they give it back to you, and so forth.  So, taking care of the ne cessary steps is what this verb is meant to convey – is meant to communicate to you.   

Mahmoud says that it will take at least five days to wire m oney through his bank. That, by the way, is generally true internationally; it takes a longer time to use your bank to wire money, a longer time than a private service and that’s what Sharon recommends.  She says, “You can just use a privat e wire service like Western Union and the money will be available to him i mmediately.”  “Western Union” is the name of a company that lets you send money electronically almost anywhere in the world, and the person you are sending it can pick it up usually within a day, sometimes less.  Sharon says, “I wire money all the time using Western Union.  Here is a blank form.”  Boy, Sharon is p retty amazing; she actually has the form for wiring money to Western Union  with her!  I guess she carries those around.  Anyway, she gives him a blank form.  A “blank form” would be an empty form, one that doesn’t have anything writte n on it yet.  So the place where you put your name is empty – it’s blank; in genera l “blank” means empty. “Blank” has a couple of other meanings however, and those  are also in our Learning Guide for this episode. 

Sharon says, “Here’s a blank form.  I can help you fill it  out if you want me to.” “To fill (something) out,” or “to fill out (somethin g)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to write or type information where it is requ ested on a form.  So, when you come to the United States you have to fill out a fo rm for a visitor: you need to put your name, the country where you live, where you are going in the U.S., how  

 long you will be there, and so forth.  That’s to fill out something or to fill something out – to put the information onto the docum ent, paper, or form. 

Mahmoud says, “That would be great.  Hey, this form is fo r a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire?”  “Yes” is the answer.  A “money transfer” is money sent electronically from one person to another; it is the same as a wire. Sharon says, “Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the re ceiver or recipient information here and the sender information there.”  She’s obviously pointing or indicating on the form where Mahmoud should put this i nformation.  There are two kinds of information: the first is for the recipient .  A “recipient” (recipient) is someone who receives something, someone who gets somethin g from someone else.  If you give someone a gift, the person you give t he gift to is the recipient. Or you could win, for example, a prize; we would talk ab out the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.  Those are the people who have receive d prize.  The recipient of the money is Mahmoud’s brother.  Mahmoud i s the person sending the money, and so we call him the “sender.”  Remember in English we sometimes add an “er” at the end of a verb to make it the person who does that thing.  “To play” becomes “player” when we talk about t he person who plays, and so forth, and that’s what is going on here. 

Mahmoud says, “Can I pay in a local currency?”  “Currency”  is the type of money that you use in a particular country.  In the United St ates we use the dollar, in most of Europe – Western Europe they use the euro, in Ja pan they use the yen, and so forth.  “Local currency,” then, is the currency of th e place where you are sending your money.  Mahmoud wants to know if he can pay i n local currency, meaning can he pay in Mexican pesos even though the pers on is going to pick up the money in dollars, and the answer, of course, is yes.   Sharon says, “Sure (meaning yes).  When you go to the Western Union office,  they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.”  “To calculate” means to add, subtract, multiply, or divide; that is, to use mathematics, or math, to find the answer to something.  The “exchange rate” i s the price of one currency in another currency.  It’s what, for example, if  you come to the United States with a euro – one euro, and you go to a place –  a bank where they exchange money (they give you the local currency of that count ry), they would give you say $1.20 or $1.30 – 1 dollar and 30 cents.  Tha t’s the exchange rate – that’s the price of a dollar in euros or the price of a  euro in dollars. 

Mahmoud says, “Is there a fee (fee)?”  A “fee” is the am ount of money that you pay a business, an organization, or the government for a  particular purpose.  If you want to, for example, play golf at a public golf co urse – a government-owned golf course in Los Angeles – you have to pay a fee.  That’ s money that you pay  

 for that particular thing.  This is somewhat different than taxes; “taxes” are usually a percentage of some other amount of money that you either make or spend.  A fee is a particular price of doing something t hat only that one person would pay. 

Sharon says, “Yes, there is  (a fee), and it’s a little higher if you want the mo ney to be available immediately.”  If you are sending money by Western Union and you want the person to be able to pick up the money today in stead of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, they charge you more money; they charg e you a higher fee. Notice we use “high” and “low” in talking about fees be cause they represent money, which is represented or counted by numbers which ca n be high or low. “If you had more time,” Sharon said, “you could save a l ittle by using the slower service that makes the money available in three business days.”   A “business day” is typically Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Fr iday.  The weekends, Saturday and Sunday, are not considered business d ays since many businesses are closed.  So if someone says, “We will send that  to you in five to seven business days,” and today is Wednesday, they mean that th ey will send it to you not by Sunday, which is five normal or calendar days,  but five business days, which would be next Wednesday, or possibly even Friday if it is seven days. 

Sharon says to Mahmoud, “All done?” meaning all finishe d – are you finished? Mahmoud says, “Yeah, I think so.  Now what (now what do I do)?”  Sharon says, “Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office.  They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number.”  When you send a wire with Western Union they give it an official number that they use to keep tra ck of – to put it into their computer, and that control number is what you give the o ther person, the recipient.  They put that control number – it’s called a  “money transfer control number” – on the form that they fill out, and that’s how they can find it easily in the computer.  So that’s a control number specifically fo r a wire “via,” or using, Western Union.  Sharon says, “Your brother can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office in New York.”   Western Union will also ask you for your name and your address and your phone n umber, but the control number is the most important piece of informati on.   

Mahmoud says, “Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.”  When we say som eone’s a “lifesaver” we mean that person has helped us a great d eal.  They’ve saved our life – they prevented us from dying.  Of course, that’s n ot literally true – it’s not actually true, but we say that when someone has helped u s a great deal: “You’re a lifesaver.”   

 Sharon said, “So, what’s the emergency?”  Why do you need  to send this money to your brother?  Mahmoud says, “Tickets go on sale for my  favorite baseball team.”  They go on sale, meaning they will start sellin g them, tomorrow. Mahmoud says, “My brother and I have to get tickets.”  Shar on says, “That’s the emergency?!”  She cannot believe that the emergency is the  fact that Mahmoud’s brother has to buy some baseball tickets.  Mahmoud says, “F or us (meaning for my brother and me), it’s a matter of life and death.”   When you say something is “a matter of life and death” you mean it is very impo rtant, it is very serious. Sometimes you mean that literally – you mean the person could die if something doesn’t happen.  Often however, just like the term “lif esaver,” we use it as an exaggeration really, to say it’s very important, it’s very se rious.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
