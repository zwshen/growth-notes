[start of dialogue]

Ronny: Ready?

Judy: Ready as I’ll ever be.

Ronny: Try to work up a little enthusiasm about mee ting my parents.

Judy: It’s not them I’m worried about. It’s me. Wha t if I don’t pass muster?

Ronny: My parents are going to love you. They’re op en-minded and nonjudgmental people. They won’t care about anythin g except that I like you and you make me happy.

Judy: Me and parents are like oil and water. I’ve n ever been good at making a good first impression.

Ronny: Then you’ll gradually win them over. Meeting  my parents will be a cakewalk. They’re nice people. It’s not like you’ll  be running the gauntlet meeting my nine brothers.

Judy: You didn’t tell them I’d be meeting your pare nts tonight, did you?

Ronny: I may have mentioned it to Mark. Why?

Judy: What if they decide to show up and ambush me?

 Ronny: They won’t.

Judy: If you found out that one of your brothers we re bringing a girlfriend home to meet your parents, wouldn’t you want to be there?

Ronny: You have a point there, but it’s too late to  back out now. Put on your game face and let’s go, or we’ll be late.

Judy: Okay, but just don’t be surprised if I make a  break for it.

Our dialogue begins with Ronny asking Judy if she i s ready. He simply says the word “Ready?” – meaning “Are you ready?” Judy says,  “Ready as I’ll ever be.” When you say you are ready as you’ll ever be, you m ean that you don’t feel very confident about doing something, but you have done as much preparation as you can. You are as prepared as possible. Judy says, “R eady as I’ll ever be.”

Ronny says, “Try to work up a little enthusiasm abo ut meeting my parents.” “To work up” is a phrasal verb which here means to crea te a feeling or an emotion – basically, to get excited about something. “Enthusi asm” is excitement, interest in something. Ronny is asking Judy to work up a little  enthusiasm about meeting his parents.

Judy says, “It’s not them I’m worried about.” She’s  not worried about Ronny’s parents. She says, “It’s me. What if I don’t pass m uster?” The expression “to pass muster” (muster) means to be acceptable, to me et the minimum requirements or expectations about something. To be  good enough for something is “to pass muster.”

Judy is worried that she won’t be good enough for R onny’s parents. This, as anyone who has ever met the parents of one’s new bo yfriend or girlfriend knows, is a very legitimate and logical concern. Parents o ften think that the person their son or daughter has chosen as a boyfriend or girlfr iend is not good enough for their own child. Actually, when my girlfriend, now wife, first met my parents, my parents didn’t think I was good enough for her – wh ich, of course, is completely true.

Ronny says, “My parents are going to love you. They ’re open-minded and nonjudgmental people.” “To be open-minded” means to  be willing to accept and consider new ideas. “To be nonjudgmental” means to be not judgmental. “To be

judgmental” (judgmental) means to be very critical about someone or something, to think something is very bad, or to consider some thing in a very negative light. “To be judgmental” usually means to be disapproving  of someone in a way that is considered extreme or not very nice.

“Nonjudgmental” would be the opposite of that. That ’s what Ronny says his parents are – they’re “nonjudgmental.” “They won’t care about anything except that I like you and you make me happy.” If that’s t rue, Ronny doesn’t have a very good pair of parents, does he? Parents should be co ncerned about more than whether the person likes them. No intelligent paren t would take a look at their daughter’s new boyfriend and, after discovering tha t he is a murderer and a thief, say “Oh, well, that’s not important as long as he m akes you happy.” Well, maybe some parents are like that. I don’t know.

Judy says, “Me and parents are like oil and water.”  Notice she says “me” instead of “I,” which would be the grammatically correct wa y of saying that. But in informal conversation, we would just say “me” – “me  and parents.” She’s referring here to the fact that when she meets pare nts of her boyfriends – we don’t know how many boyfriends she’s had, but appar ently she had had bad experiences with the parents of her previous boyfri ends.

That’s why she says, “Me and parents are like oil a nd water.” “Oil” and “water” don’t mix together. They stay separate. The idea be hind this phrase or expression is that you don’t get along with other p eople. If you say these two people “are like oil and water,” you’re saying that  they don’t get along with each other. They don’t have a good relationship.

Judy says, “I’ve never been good at making a good f irst impression.” Your “first impression” is the first time that you meet someone , the first time that you have a chance to see someone. Your first impression is you r first encounter, your first meeting. We talk about “making a good first impress ion” because many people are unable to change their minds after they get an idea about what you are like. So, if the first time they meet you, you do somethi ng that makes them not like you, they may not like you again in the future, eve n though you may change your behavior and do other things.

So, making a good first impression is considered a good idea because people often keep their first impression and don’t change their minds, even though the person may act differently in the future. Ronny say s, “Then you’ll gradually win them over.” “To win someone over” is to persuade or  convince someone to like you, to have a good impression of you, a good opini on of you. The word “gradually” (gradually) means slowly, over a long p eriod of time.

 Ronny says, “Meeting my parents will be a cakewalk. ” The term “cakewalk” (cakewalk) – one word – means something that is ver y easy to do. He says his parents are nice people. “It’s not like you’ll be r unning the gauntlet meeting my nine brothers.” “To run the gauntlet” (gauntlet) he re means to experience a lot of problems, especially from a group of people, each o f whom may give you problems. We learned that Ronny has nine brothers, which is, of course, a very large family. I only have eight brothers, so I come  from a much smaller family than Ronny.

Judy says, “You didn’t tell them” – meaning his bro thers – “I’d be meeting your parents tonight, did you?” Ronny says, “I may have mentioned it to Mark. Why?” Judy says, “What if they” – Ronny’s brothers – “dec ide to show up and ambush me.” “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb that h ere means to appear, often unexpectedly, when people weren’t expecting you to be there.

“To ambush” (ambush) someone means to attack them u nexpectedly. A surprise attack is an “ambush.” Usually, we think about seve ral people attacking one person, or a large group attacking a small group, u nexpectedly. Ronny says, “They won’t” – they won’t show up.

Judy says, “If you found out” – if you discovered –  “that one of your brothers were bringing a girlfriend home to meet your parents, wo uldn’t you want to be there?” Judy doubts that Ronny is correct about his brother  not being there, because if Ronny were in the same situation – finding out one of his brothers was bringing home a new girlfriend for the first time to meet the parents – he would definitely want to be there. Ronny says, “You have a point the re,” meaning, “Yes, I agree with what you say.” “But it’s too late to back out now.” “To back out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to change your mind – to decid e not to do something that you said you were going to do.

Ronny says, “Put on your game face and let’s go, or  we’ll be late.” “To put on your game face” is an expression meaning hide your emotions, or make yourself look stronger or more prepared than what you really  are. Your “game face” would be the facial expression, literally, that you have during some sort of competition. You don’t want the other person to think that you a re scared or weak, so you put on your “game face.”

Judy says, “Okay, but just don’t be surprised if I make a break for it.” The expression “to make a break (break) for it” means t o leave unexpectedly and very quickly when you no longer want to be in a certain situation. If you are trying to

escape someone, for example, you might use this exp ression: “Let’s make a break for it” – let’s try to escape from this situa tion.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
