In this episode, we’re going to hear a conversation  between Tania and Emilio about threatening other countries.  When two countr ies are having difficulties, shall we say, and might even in fact start fighting  each other.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Tania:  Did you see the news today?  Canada has bee n doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border.  I think they’re tryin g to send us a message. 

Emilio:  They’re just saber-rattling.  They think w e’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.   

Tania:  I don’t think they’re just posturing.   

Emilio:  Canada is no real threat.  No one in the g overnment wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty with us .   

Tania:  How can you say that?  All of this military  aggression makes me nervous. If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choic e but to retaliate.  Things could escalate very quickly. 

Emilio:  That’s why I’m well prepared. 

Tania:  Well prepared?  How? 

Emilio:  Haven’t you seen me building my undergroun d bunker?  I’ll be safe there if Canada, or anyone else, strikes. 

Tania:  An underground bunker? 

Emilio:  Yes, and if you ask nicely, I’ll save a pl ace for you. 

[end of dialogue] 

Tania begins by saying to Emilio, “Did you see the news today (the news reports or the newspaper)?  Canada has been doing military exercises near the Canada- U.S. border.”  “Military exercises” are one way tha t the military – the army and the navy – use to train.  It is sort of like a fake  war; they test their systems to make sure that everything is working, that their so ldiers know what to do, and so forth.  Sometimes it’s called a “war game” in fact.   The “border” is the line that divides two countries or states or provinces.  It’s  a geographic line that separates two pieces of land. 

In the dialogue, Canada is apparently mad at the Un ited States and their military – their army and navy – is doing military exercises  near the border.  Tania says, “I think they’re trying to send us a message.”  “To  send (someone) a message” means to make sure that the person understands exac tly what you’re thinking without necessarily saying it directly to them.  So , we’re communicating something but it isn’t necessarily in words. 

Emilio says, “They (meaning the evil Canadians) are  just saber-rattling.”  A “saber” (saber) is a large sword that’s sharp that you could kill someone with. “To rattle” (rattle) is to make a noise.  Often whe n you have pieces of metal that are next to each other they may make a noise like t his: [rattling sound].  That wasn’t a saber, those were actually the pens that I  have in this blue cup I keep here next my microphone that has a lot of pens and pencils and that sort of thing. I guess you use a pen to kill someone – possible.  Anyway, “saber-rattling” is an old expression that means a certain country is tryi ng to demonstrate or show someone else that they are militarily powerful.  So , they may do military exercises or they may do things that show their mil itary in action.  That’s saber- rattling. 

Emilio says, “They (the Canadians) think we’re amas sing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.”  “To amass” (amass) means to collect or gather as many items of a certain thing as you can and put th em all in one place.  I have amassed several pens and pencils in my blue cup her e on the desk.  A “weapon” is something that will hurt you, something physical  typically, a tool, if you will, for hurting someone: a knife, a gun, that sort of thing  – a pen.  So Canada thinks the U.S. is amassing weapons near the border, and the C anadians, in response to this, are posturing.  “To posture” (posture) as a v erb means to present yourself in a certain way to convey a certain impression on the  other person.  It’s often used  

in the negative sense of someone who’s trying to be  something they’re not, or someone who perhaps is doing this for no good reaso n.   

Tania says, “I don’t think they’re just posturing.”   They’re not just acting this way, they really are angry – because everyone knows, Can adians can get very angry! Emilio says, “Canada is no real threat.”  A “threat ” is a risk, something that can cause harm or damage.  Emilio says, “No one in the government wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty wit h us.”  “To bear (bear – just like the animal) the responsibility” means to admit when  something has gone wrong and accept the consequences.  Another expression we  might use is “to be held accountable.”  So no one in the government wants to  bear the responsibility – wants to have the responsibility of “violating,” or  breaking, not following Canada’s treaty with us.  A “treaty” is a formal agreement b etween two countries to do something or not do something.  The Treaty of Versa illes ended World War I; the SALT, or Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, helped r educe the number of nuclear weapons between the United States and the then Sovi et Union.   

Tania says, “How can you say that?  All of this mil itary aggression makes me nervous.”  “Aggression” is when someone is angry or  mad and actually does something about it.  Military aggression would be w hen the military is showing their power – is showing their strength because the ir country is angry.  She says, “If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choi ce but to retaliate.”  “To attack” means to begin a fight or a battle.  Usuall y it’s something between two armies, but it could be two people.  “He was attack ed by a dog last night,” the dog tried to bite him.  Or, “She was attacked by th e mean cat that was in the neighbors’ yard.”  These, of course, are our real t hreats: cats and dogs!  But, going back to our back to our story – I’m kidding, of course.  Going back to our story, Tania says, “we would have no choice (if Can ada decides to attack) but to retaliate.”  When we say “we have no choice but to (do something)” we mean we have no other option, we must do this.  In this cas e, we must retaliate.  “To retaliate” (retaliate) means to do something bad to  another person after he or she has done something bad to you.  It’s similar to ano ther word: “revenge.” “Retaliate” usually is related to someone trying to  hurt you – someone trying to hurt your country, and you then attack them back to  defend yourself.  Tania says, “Things could escalate very quickly.”  “To escalate ” (escalate) means to increase the importance or seriousness or intensity of somet hing, to involve more people, to move something to a higher level, to make it mor e serious, to make it bigger perhaps.  So when two countries start fighting with  each other, sometimes the violence can escalate.  They kill 5 people, and the n you kill 10 of their people, and they retaliate and kill 25 of your people.  Tha t’s escalating violence; it’s getting worse and worse as we go forward in time. 

Emilio says to this possibility of escalation (the noun of “to escalate”), “That’s why I’m well prepared (I’m ready),” Emilio says.  Tania  asks him, “Well prepared? How?”  How are you well prepared?  Emilio says, “Ha ven’t you seen me building my underground bunker?”  “Underground” is something  that is below the ground, in the earth.  A “bunker” (bunker) is a strong, saf e place where you are protected against some military attack; you are underground.  So, an “underground bunker” is a place where you could be safe if you were atta cked or your country was attacked, that’s the idea.  There were some people,  especially back in the 50s and 60s, that built bunkers in their houses because  they were afraid of a nuclear attack on the United States.  I’m not sure if the b unker would have helped very much!  Anyway, Emilio says, “I’ll be safe there (in  my bunker) if Canada, or anyone else, strikes.”  “To strike” here means to h it someone or to attack someone; to send a bomb, that’s an example of strik ing.  There was a movie, one of the Star Wars  movies, The Empire Strikes Back , meaning the Empire attacks after being attacked. 

Tania says, “An underground bunker?”  Emilio says, “Yes, and if you ask nicely (if you’re nice to me), I’ll save a place for you.”   So that’s what some people are doing preparing for Canada’s attack on the United S tates! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Tania:  Did you see the news today?  Canada has bee n doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border.  I think they’re tryin g to send us a message. 

Emilio:  They’re just saber-rattling.  They think w e’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.
