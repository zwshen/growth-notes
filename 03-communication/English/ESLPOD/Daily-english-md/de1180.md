This episode is a dialogue between Pedro and Elisa about companies that increase their prices suddenly. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pedro: Why are you changing the prices on all of th ose items in the store?

Elisa: Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane comin g. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.

Pedro: I know that, but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.

Elisa: There’s nothing wrong with taking advantage of a spike in demand during emergency situations. We’re in business to make mon ey.

Pedro: That’s price gouging and you know it. There are laws against that. And plus, we shouldn’t be exploiting people’s fear.

Elisa: I’m not responsible for that hurricane and I  didn’t tell people to hoard. I’m not hiking prices so high that people can’t afford it. I’m just increasing them to discourage hoarding, that’s all.

Pedro: I don’t know. It still doesn’t feel right. I t feels like we’re profiteering.

Elisa: No, we’re not. We’re making a sound business  decision. Hey, where are you going with those?

Pedro: I’m putting some of these items in the back to reserve for people who can’t afford your new prices, the poorest and the m ost vulnerable in our community.

Elisa: You’re not suggesting we give those items aw ay!

Pedro: You’ll thank me later for helping you to ass uage your guilty conscience.

Elisa: Humph!

Pedro begins by asking Elisa, “Why are you changing  the prices on all of those items in the store?” An “item” is simply a thing th at you sell in your store. Alisa says, “Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane comin g. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.”

A “hurricane” (hurricane) is a violent storm with w inds that move in a circle, in a circular motion. These are called “typhoons” in som e parts of the world. Basically, in the Atlantic Ocean, these storms are called “hur ricanes.” They’re the storms that typically affect the eastern and southern part  of the U.S. In certain parts of the Pacific Ocean and other oceans, they’re called “typhoons,” but it’s the same weather phenomenon.

“People will be stocking up,” Elisa says. “To stock  (stock) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to buy a lot of something and save it to use later. If there is a hurricane coming, it’s possible that the stores w ill then be closed, and so you will want to stock up – you will want to get a lot of things that you will need so that you can survive. We would call these things “basic (basic) necessities.” “Necessities” comes from the word “necessary.” It’s  referring to things that you actually need to live, such as food and water.

So, Elisa is raising the prices – changing the pric es on the items in her store because everyone is going to be coming and buying b asic necessities, and one of the features of what we call a “market economy” is that the price of something depends on both how much there is of it and how muc h people want it. And if there isn’t very much and a lot of people want it, the price goes up.

Elisa is expecting more people to want to buy thing s from her store, and so she’s raising the prices. Pedro says, “I know that,” mean ing I know there’s a hurricane coming, “but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.” The

phrasal verb “to jack (jack) up” means to increase very significantly in a very short amount of time. Pedro had never studied econo mics in school, it appears.

Elisa says, “There’s nothing wrong with taking adva ntage of a spike in demand during emergency situations. We’re in business to make money.” A “spike” (spike) here refers to a sudden increase in somethi ng or in the amount of something. The “spike” Elisa’s referring to is a “s pike in demand” (demand). As I just mentioned, there are two things that determine  price, basically. “Demand” is the amount that people want something. “Supply” (su pply) is how much of something there is.

People adjust their priorities – people decide what ’s important to them – in part by what they buy. If something is very important to  you, then you may not buy certain things in order to have money to buy other things – things that might have a higher price. That’s one of the things that price  does. It communicates information to you about how much something is avai lable and how much other people want it, and allows you to make decisions ba sed on that information.

Elisa says that she is “taking advantage of,” meani ng she’s trying to get a benefit from, the increase in demand or spike in demand dur ing this emergency situation – the hurricane. “We’re in business to make money,”  she says. That’s the reason that she has her business. Pedro says, “That’s pric e gouging and you know it.” “Price gouging” (gouging) is not so much an economi c concept as it is a moral determination or an ethical judgment on people who do in fact raise their prices suddenly when someone needs something and wants it very badly during an emergency situation.

“To gouge” someone is to be unfair in the price tha t you charge that person. “Price gouging” is the idea that if you raise your prices significantly for something that someone wants and needs very badly – if you ra ise it significantly and quickly, I think is the idea here – then you may be  accused by some people of “price gouging” – of being unfair to people because  you have raised your prices significantly.

Pedro says, “There are laws against that.” I’m not sure if that’s true in most places in the U.S. Perhaps it is. No doubt in some places that might be true, or in other countries that might be true. “And plus” – me aning in addition – Pedro says, “we shouldn’t be exploiting people’s fear.” “To exp loit” (exploit) means to take advantage of someone or something in an unfair way,  to hurt another person in some way that involves the advantage that you have over that person.

Pedro thinks that raising the prices would be “expl oiting people’s fear.” I’m not sure why it exploits people’s fear, but that’s what  Pedro thinks. Elisa says, “I’m not responsible for that hurricane and I didn’t tel l people to hoard” (hoard). “To hoard” – very important you pronounce the last cons onant there, the D – means to buy a very large number of things, more than wha t you actually need or more than what you could even use.

Sometimes people use this verb when they have some sort of psychological problem – when they collect all sorts of things in their house and their house doesn’t have any more room anymore because they’re hoarding certain things. But in this situation, “to hoard” means to buy more  than what you are really going to use, just because you perhaps are afraid that yo u will no longer have enough. You will “run out,” to use the phrasal verb. So, El isa says she’s not telling people to hoard.

She says, “I’m not hiking prices so high that peopl e can’t afford it.” “To hike” (hike) a price means to increase it dramatically. S he says she’s increasing her prices, but not so high that people can’t afford it , meaning that no one could actually buy it. That would be stupid for her to do  economically, of course, because if she raises the price so high that no one  can buy it then she won’t make any money. “I’m just increasing them,” meaning  her prices, “to discourage hoarding, that’s all.” “To discourage” (discourage)  means to make other people not want to do something.

Elisa is saying that she’s increasing her prices so  people don’t hoard and presumably there will be more of these basic necess ities for other people. I’m not sure if that’s exactly her reason and neither is Pe dro. He says, “I don’t know. It still doesn’t feel right,” meaning it doesn’t seem correct. It doesn’t seem like it is ethical. “It feels like we’re profiteering.” “Profi teering” (profiteering) means to make an unfair profit.

Usually the idea here is that you’re making a large  amount of money, but you’re hurting other people while doing it. We only think this typically of other people or other companies that raise their prices suddenly. I f we’re benefiting from it, well, we don’t normally consider ourselves to be profitee ring. Elisa says, “No, we’re not,” meaning we’re not profiteering. “We’re making  a sound business decision.” The word “sound” here refers not to noise or someth ing that you can hear, but rational, logical, well thought out. “It’s a sound decision.” It’s a good, reasonable decision.

“Hey, we’re you going with those?” Elisa says. Pedr o responds, “I’m putting some of these items in the back,” meaning in the back of  the store, “to reserve for

people who can’t afford your new prices.” “To reser ve” (reserve) here means to save something that you are going to use at a later  time. Pedro says, “the poorest and most vulnerable in our community” are g oing to be the ones he’s going to give or sell these items to – “vulnerable”  (vulnerable) means easily hurt or damaged – people who, according to Pedro, won’t have enough money to buy these basic necessities.

Elisa says, “You’re not suggesting we give those it ems away!” “To give something away” means to let other people have it f or free, to not charge them any money. Pedro says, “You’ll thank me later for h elping you to assuage your guilty conscience.” “To assuage” (assuage) means to  reduce, to make less intense. Something may “assuage” your fears, may ma ke you less afraid. In this case, Pedro wants to assuage Elisa’s “guilty consci ence” (conscience). Your “conscience” is what tells you whether something is  right or wrong. If you are guilty, you’ve done something wrong.

So, a “guilty conscience” is the idea you have that  you’ve done something wrong. And that’s what Pedro thinks Elisa is doing by rais ing the prices on basic necessities. So, he’s going to give some of the thi ngs the store sells to people who he considers poor and vulnerable so that Elisa won’t feel so bad in the future when she will no doubt regret having raised the pri ces. That’s why he says, “You’ll thank me later” – when you realize what you  are doing – “for helping you assuage your guilty conscience.” Elisa, of course, isn’t very happy with Pedro for doing this.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
