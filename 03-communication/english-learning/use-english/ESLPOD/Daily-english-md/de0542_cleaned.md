This episode is called “Renting a Movie.”  It is a dialog ue between Brenda and Jang, talking about renting movies to watch at home.  Le t’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Brenda:  I have to return these movies in the drop box  today or I’ll have late fees. Can I get you anything while I’m out?   

Jang:  Are you still renting movies from the video store?   I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox.  There are never any la te fees. 

Brenda:  I’ve thought about subscribing to one of those services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store.  I like checki ng out the new releases and staff picks, and you never know what you’ll fin d to buy in the bargain bins. 

Jang:  Renting movies online is so much quicker and easier.   I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read reviews, and some times even watch a trailer.  Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I mail one movie back, they send me another one.  It’s that simpl e. 

Brenda:  It does sound easy, but not everything that’s ea sy is better.  Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.    

Jang:  Whatever.  If you want to spend your time looking  for movies rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative. 

 Brenda:  Are you really going to let me off so easily?  I thought I was in for another one of your lectures. 

Jang:  You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.

Our dialogue begins when Brenda says, “I have to return these movies in the drop box today or I’ll have late fees.”  A “drop box” ( two words) is a large box – a large square container that has an opening were you can  put things into it, usually to return something to a store; it could also be  a public library.  Most libraries, as well as video rental stores, have boxes that  you can put the movie into and you don’t have to go in and talk to anyone.  Y ou just return the movie by putting it into the drop box.  There’s another verb “ to drop off,” a two-word phrasal verb, which means to leave something for someone else.  So, you can drop off your movies in a drop box when you’re finished w atching them.  Brenda says she needs to return the movies or she’ll have late fees.   A “late fee” is an amount of money that you pay as a penalty for bringing something back late.  So if you rent a movie, and you return it three days late , you’ll probably have to pay a late fee: maybe 5 dollars maybe 10 dollars, it depend s on the store.  For the libraries, you may have to pay a quarter, you may have to p ay a dollar; again, it depends on the library.  But, those are late fees; they could also be called a “fine” or a “penalty.”   

Brenda then asks Jang, “Can I get you anything while I’m  out?”  Jang says, “Are you still renting movies from the video store?”  “To rent ,” as you probably know, means to pay to use something for a short period of tim e.  You can rent a car; you can rent a house; you can rent a movie.  I read somewh ere that in some places you can also rent a dog or a cat.  I’m not sure why anyone would do that. But if you want to, this is America, you can do whatever you want, they say. Anyway, Jang asks Brenda, “Are you still renting movies from the video store?” The “video store” is the place that you rent, nowadays, DV Ds.  I guess in some video stores, you can still rent the old VHS cassette tapes .  Jang says, “I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox,” meaning th e movies are mailed to his house or apartment.  “There are never any late f ees.” 

Brenda says, “I’ve thought about subscribing to one of tho se services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store.”  “To sub scribe” means to pay for a service each month.  Usually you pay a little bit every we ek or every month to continue having a certain service.  If you have satellite o r cable television, you have to subscribe.  You have to pay a monthly fee in orde r to get that service; it could be anywhere from 25 to 125 dollars.  Brenda says th at she doesn’t want to  

 subscribe to one of these services because she thinks she would miss browsing. “To browse” (browse) means to looks slowly at what is availa ble in a store, to look and see if there’s anything new or interesting.  I t’s when you are not necessarily looking for one specific thing, but you just sort of want to see what is available.  Brenda says, “I like checking out the new relea ses and staff picks, and you never know what you’re going to find to buy in the bargain bins.”  She says she likes checking out.  “To check out” is a two-word phrasal  verb meaning to look at something, to see something.  Sometimes this expre ssion is used between people.  If you say, “The man was checking out the  woman walking down the street,” that means that he was looking at he r in some sort of romantic or perhaps sexual way.  But here, in general “to check out ” just means to find out, to investigate, to look at something in this case.  “New releases” are things that have just been published.  When a DVD movie is first rele ased, meaning you can first get it – first made available, that would be cal led a new release.  “Staff picks” are when the people who work at the video store recomm end movies to other people.  So there’s usually a separate section, and belo w are the names of someone who works at the store who recommends movies.  Th e idea being that someone who works at the video store may know a lot about  movies; that isn’t always true.  Brenda says she likes to check out the new rele ases and staff picks, “and you never know what you’ll find to buy in the bargain bins.”  A “bin” is a large box.  A “bargain” is something that is cheap, so mething has a low price or a good price for what it is worth.  A “bargain bin,” then, is a big box that has things in it that are cheap – cheap to buy.  In a video store, the bargain bin would be movies – DVDs that the store was selling, not just re nting. 

Jang says that renting movies online is so much quicker and e asier.  He says, “I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read r eviews, and sometimes even watch a trailer.”  A “review,” in this case, is a wri tten opinion that somebody has about the movie.  The word “review” has several diffe rent meanings however; take a look at our Learning Guide for additi onal explanations.  A “trailer” is a short video advertisement for the movie.  It’s like a movie commercial that tells you a little bit about the movie and what it is a bout.  Jang says, “Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I  mail one movie back, they send me another one.  It’s that simple.”  A “queue ” (queue) is a list of things, in a particular order, that are being waited for – t hings that you are waiting for. Or, if you are waiting for something yourself in a lin e, that could also be called a queue.  That use of the word is a little more common in British English; here we would just say, “I was waiting in line.”  I was standing in line.  “Queue,” in this dialogue, means the list of movies that you want to rent .  So if you rent movies online, you can pick the movies you want, and then they wi ll send them to you when you send a movie that you already rented back.  What happens is they mail you, usually, two or three movies at a time, and you can o nly have two or three  

 movies rented at one time.  You have to return – that is, mail your DVD back to the company, and they will mail you a new movie, the ne xt movie on your queue. 

Brenda says, “It does sound easy, but not everything that’s e asy is better.  Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.”  “T o make your selection” is just another way of saying to select, to choose.  Jang says, “ Whatever.” “Whatever,” in this case, is used to show that you either don’t believe what a person is telling you or you don’t agree with what anot her person has said.  It’s an informal expression; it’s a negative expression.  You wouldn’t want to say it to anyone that was in authority over you, like your boss, cert ainly not to someone that you don’t know – unless you don’t like the person anyw ay, I’m not sure. “Whatever” can mean other things as well; once again, t he Learning Guide will give you more information about how to use this word. 

Jang says, “If you want to spend your time looking for movie s rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative.”  A “prerogati ve” is your right, something that you are allowed to do.  Brenda says, “Are you reall y going to let me off so easily?  I thought I was in for another one of your l ectures.”  “To let (someone) off easily” means not to fight someone.  You could argue wi th them, you could fight with them but you decide, eh, it’s not worth your troub le.  You decide to let them off easily.  Brenda says that she thought she was going to get another one of Jang’s lectures.  A “lecture” is normally a speech that a pr ofessor would give to his students – a presentation.  But when you use it in an  informal sense, it’s almost always a negative description of someone who is tell ing you what you should do, as if they were your professor.  Teenagers migh t complain that their parents are always lecturing them; they’re always giving th em lessons, usually about the things that they’re doing wrong.  But of cou rse, teenagers do a lot of things wrong, so it’s hard to blame the parents! 

Jang says, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t ma ke it drink.”  This is an old expression.  It means that you can tell a person wh at to do, and give him or her opportunities to do it, but you can’t force some one to do something.  They have to want to do it.  So, you can lead a horse to w ater – you can bring a horse, the animal, to a bucket of water, say – but you can’t fo rce the horse to drink.  So, this is an old expression.  What Jang is saying is that he h as given Brenda the information she needs about renting online, if she doe sn’t want to use it then that’s her decision – that’s her problem. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

 Brenda:  I have to return these movies in the drop box  today or I’ll have late fees. Can I get you anything while I’m out?   

Jang:  Are you still renting movies from the video store?   I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox.  There are never any la te fees.
