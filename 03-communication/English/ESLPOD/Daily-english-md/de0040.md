In this episode, we're going to see Lucy go through  her bedtime ritual, and go to sleep. Let's get started. 

[Start of story] 

I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to ge t ready for bed.  I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up.  I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a towel.  Then I put some toner on my face and  then some moisturizer.  I comb my hair and tie it back.  I don’t like getting  hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps.  I floss and brush my teeth, a nd am ready for bed.  By this time, I am pretty beat.   

I go into my bedroom and I get undressed.  I put th e dirty clothes in the hamper and put on my pajamas.  I take off my slippers and pull back the covers.  I check my alarm to make sure it’s on.  I have this same ri tual every night, which I think helps me fall asleep more easily.  It’s not long be fore I’m fast asleep.

Lucy begins by saying that she is "feeling pretty t ired," or very tired, "by 11:00" and decides "to get ready for bed."  She goes into her "bathroom to take off" her "make-up."  To take off means to remove or to get r id of her make-up.  She uses "a cleanser to wash" her "face," and then dries "it  with a towel."  A cleanser, "cleanser," comes from the word clean, "clean."  It  means something that you use to clean your face, in this example.  You could als o have a cleanser that cleaned other things.  But here, we use it to describe a li quid that you put on your face, kind of like a soap that helps clean your face, and  that's called a cleanser. 

After Lucy washes her face with the cleanser, she t hen dries "it with a towel," "towel."  A towel is a piece of cloth or material t hat you use to dry things with. When Lucy is finished drying her face, she puts on "some toner," "toner."  Toner is a liquid that women put on their face, usually j ust women.  The liquid is

supposed to make the skin on a woman's face softer,  and also a little bit firmer - a little bit tighter.  This is something women do a t night after they have cleaned their face, I think.   

The word toner comes from the verb to tone, "tone,"  which has a couple of different meanings, but is often used when you are talking about your muscles - that you want to make your muscles stronger so that  they look better.  This is a case of using the word as a noun, with an "r" at th e end, toner, and as we said, it is a liquid that some women put on their face at ni ght. 

Well, after Lucy puts this toner on her face, then she puts on "some moisturizer." Moisturizer, "moisturizer," comes from the word moi st, "moist," which means wet, the opposite of dry.  If we say something is moist,  we mean that it is wet - there is water on it.  A moisturizer, as a noun, is a liquid  that women put on their face, and sometimes their arms and legs, to make the skin  less dry - to give their skin more moisture, which is another noun that comes fro m the word moist.  It also makes their skin a little softer. 

Then Lucy combs her hair and ties "it back."  To co mb, "comb," as a verb, means to use an instrument to straighten your hair - to p ut it in a certain place - to move your hair in a certain way.  The thing that you use  is called a comb, "comb."  So, it's both a verb and a noun.  A comb is usually a l ong piece of plastic, sometimes metal, that has little - almost like little sticks that come out of it, and we call those little sticks the teeth of the comb, just like your  teeth in your mouth. 

Lucy combs her hair and ties "it back."  To tie, "t ie," something is to create - usually to create a little knot, "knot," which is w hen you take a piece of rope or string and you move it in such a way that it create s almost like a little lock, and we call that a knot.  For example, when you are tyi ng your shoes, you take the little strings in your shoes, such as tennis shoes - we called those strings shoelaces - and you tie knots in them so that they' re tight.  So, you tie a knot to keep a rope tight - to keep it from becoming loose.  

In the story, Lucy says that she ties her hair back , which means she takes her hair, and because she has long hair, she takes her hair and she puts it toward the back of her head, and then she puts something a round it to keep it there so it doesn't go back onto her face.  This is tying it ba ck. 

Lucy says that she doesn't "like getting hair in" h er "face," and that is why she ties her hair back.  Then she flosses and brushes h er teeth, and is now "ready for

bed.  By this time," she says," I am pretty beat," "beat."  When you say you are pretty beat, you mean you are very tired. 

Lucy goes into her bedroom and she gets undressed.  To undress is the opposite of to dress.  To dress means to put clothes on you,  so to undress means to take your clothes off.  To get undressed means to undres s yourself - to take your clothes off. 

Lucy takes her dirty clothes and puts them into a h amper.  A hamper, "hamper," is also sometimes called a clothes hamper, and it's  a little box, you can think of it as, it's a little box where you put your dirty clot hes or dirty towels that has a top on it.  It is - usually has a top on it, and that i s a clothes hamper.  You often find them in a bedroom or sometimes in a bathroom. 

After Lucy puts her "dirty clothes in the hamper," she puts on her pajamas. Pajamas, "pajamas," is a type of clothes that you w ear to bed.  So, they're special clothes that you wear when you are going to  go to bed and fall asleep. 

Lucy takes off her slippers and pulls "back the cov ers."  She removes her slippers, "slippers."  Slippers are shoes that you wear inside your house.  They are usually soft and comfortable.  You wear them to  keep your feet warm, and also to keep them clean from your floors.  That's a  slipper. 

To "pull back the covers" means to take the blanket  that is on your bed and to take the top and to pull it towards the bottom so t hat you can see the sheets of the bed.  Covers, remember, "covers," are the blank ets and the sheets that you put on top of your bed to keep you warm.  So, you p ull them back so you can get into the bed, and after you get into the bed, then you can pull them up - put them back over your body. 

Lucy says that she has "this same ritual every nigh t."  A ritual, "ritual," is similar to a routine.  It's when you do the same things in the  same way over and over again.  Every day you get up, you brush your teeth,  you watch television, you go to work.  That could be your ritual - your routine - what you do on a regular basis. Ritual can also refer to a religious ceremony - a r eligious event, but here it just means the things that Lucy does every night.   

She thinks that doing this ritual in the same way e very night helps her "fall asleep more easily."  To fall, "fall," asleep means to go to sleep.  "It's not long," she says, "before I am fast asleep."  To be fast asleep , "fast," means that you are

completely asleep - that you cannot be easily woken  up.  You are very asleep, you might say.  You are fast asleep. 

Well, I hope you have not fallen fast asleep and ar e ready to listen to our story again, this time at a regular speed.
