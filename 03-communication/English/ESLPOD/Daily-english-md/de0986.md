[start of dialogue]

Anne: Where are you going with that?

Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. R ather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.

Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grand father. It’s a family heirloom.

Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock  that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one gener ation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.

Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental v alue. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf . If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck .

Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but wha t if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money th at it would fetch to good use.

Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proce eds to good use?

Ivan: Sure, of course I am.

Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending  it on?

Ivan: Not on your life!

 [end of dialogue]

Anne begins this dialogue by saying to Ivan, “Where  are you going with that?” Ivan says, “I’m taking this clock to an antique dea ler.” “Antique” (antique) refers to something that is very old. An “antique dealer” (dealer) is someone who buys old things such as jewelry, pieces of furniture, ar twork, or other things that are old and perhaps valuable. An antique dealer, of course,  tries to buy things at a low price and then sell them at a high price just like any good businessperson. “Antiques” with an “s” at the end is used to descri be these items – the things that you would bring to an antique dealer.

Ivan says, “Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.” Ivan has taken a c lock to an antique dealer in order to “get it appraised,” he says, “rather than having it gather dust.” “To gather dust” (dust) means to sit unused for a long time. “ Dust” refers to the little pieces of dirt that accumulate, that collect, on top somet hing if you don’t move it for a very long time. That’s why every week or two, you m ay need to dust your house. You may need to go around and clean the little bits  of dirt off of your tables and other things that would collect dirt.

If something has a lot of dust on it, it hasn’t bee n moved or used in a long time, and that’s the real meaning of this expression, alt hough in the case of an old clock, it might have literally – actually – been ga thering dust. A “mantelpiece” (mantelpiece) is a shelf, a place to put something above a fireplace usually in the living room, or sometimes it might be called the “f amily room,” of a house. A mantelpiece is a place where you might put old phot ographs and an old clock.

Ivan says he wants to get this clock “appraised.” “ To appraise” (appraise) means to assess or to give a value to something – to give  an opinion about how much something is worth. You could have your house appra ised. If you were trying to get a loan, someone would come and tell you how muc h your house is worth. When you go to an antique dealer to get something a ppraised, you’re asking the antique dealer how much money you could get if you sold that item. Anne does not like this idea at all. She says, “You can’t sel l that. It belonged to our grandfather” – our grandfather owned it. “It’s a fa mily heirloom.”

A “family heirloom” (heirloom) is something that be longs to your family that has been passed on, or given, from one generation to an other. Usually, it’s something that’s considered valuable. So, for examp le, if your grandfather had an expensive ring, or your grandmother had some nic e jewelry, that might be considered a family heirloom. Your grandmother gave  it to your mother, and your

mother gives it to you, and you give it to your dau ghter, and so forth. Those are family heirlooms, valuable things, but sometimes are valuable not because they’re worth a lot of money; sometimes they’re val uable for what we might call “sentimental reasons,” and we’ll explain that in a second.

Ivan says, “It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a  clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from  one generation to another.” Ivan says “Grandpa didn’t mean for it” – meaning he  wasn’t intending, he wasn’t planning for it – “to be passed down.” “To be passe d down” means to give one object, usually something that is old to someone yo unger than you are – to the next generation. For example, when I die, my microp hone that I use for podcasting will be passed down to one of my nieces and nephews. It’s going to become a family heirloom, I’m sure.

“Generation” refers to a group of people who are bo rn at approximately the same time. In a family, a generation would be all of the  brothers and sisters in a family. Your father and mother are another generation, and your grandparents are another generation, and your nieces and nephews are  a younger generation. You have younger generations and older generations.  Ivan says this clock was not meant “to be passed down from one generation to  another.” He says, “I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable.” “To be collectable” (collectable) is to be something that people want to own. Things that are collectible are usually things that are worth some money, that have some value.

Ivan says, “These clocks could be a dime a dozen.” That expression, “a dime (dime) a dozen,” refers to something that is very c ommon, very popular, and therefore not worth a lot of money. A “dime” is 10 cents in American currency. A “dozen” is 12 of something. So, if you can buy 12 of something for a dime, it’s probably not a very valuable item. We usually use t his expression to refer to things that are not rare – of which many have been made.

Anne objects. She says, “But it’s valuable to me. I t has sentimental value.” “Sentimental (sentimental) value” refers to your em otional attachment to some object. It might not be worth anything to anyone el se. It might not be very valuable in itself, but it’s something that means s omething to you. So, the first love letter that your husband wrote you or the firs t rose that you gave your wife – these would be things that might have sentimental v alue. No one else is going to buy an old rose or a piece of paper that has a love  letter on it. These are things that are valuable to you. They have sentimental val ue.

Anne continues, “As a little girl, I remember visit ing Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I  wouldn’t be looking to sell it to

make a quick buck.” “To inherit” (inherit) is to re ceive money or objects from someone who has died. You can inherit something fro m your parents. For example, they may give you things or give you money  when they die. “To make a quick buck” (buck) means to try to make money quick ly and easily. A “buck” is a dollar. It’s an informal term for one American doll ar. “To make a quick buck” is an old expression meaning to try to make money quickly  and easily.

Ivan says, “I’m not looking” – I’m not trying – “to  make a quick buck. But what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be ab le to put the money that it would fetch to good use.” “To fetch” (fetch) here m eans to bring money or to bring something to you. When we talk about what pri ce this will fetch, we mean how much money will we get, what price it will be. What Ivan is saying here is that Grandpa may have left this clock to him becaus e Grandpa knew that Ivan would put the money that he would get from it – the  money he would fetch – to good use. “To good use” here means for a good purpo se.

Anne says, “Well, are you? Are you going to put the  proceeds to good use?” “Proceeds” (proceeds) is money that you get from se lling something. There’s always an “s” on the end if it’s used as a noun in this way: “proceeds.” Ivan says, “Sure. Of course I am” – of course I’m going to put  it to good use. Anne says, “Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it o n?” Anne wants to know what Ivan is going to do with the money he gets from sel ling the old clock.

Ivan, however, refuses to tell her. He says, “Not o n your life!” That expression, “not on your life,” means no way. It’s a phrase use d to show that you are not going to do that, no matter what happens. Of course , we suspect that perhaps Ivan is not going to put the money to good use, but  is going to go gambling, or perhaps go drinking with his friends, or something that we would not normally consider to be a good use.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anne: Where are you going with that?

Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. R ather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.

Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grand father. It’s a family heirloom.

Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock  that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one gener ation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.

Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental v alue. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf . If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck .

Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but wha t if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money th at it would fetch to good use.

Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proce eds to good use?

Ivan: Not on your life!
