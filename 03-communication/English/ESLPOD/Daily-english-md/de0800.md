This episode is a dialogue between Wendy and Pedro about advertising a job on the Internet.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I’ve just heard that you’re not going to us e a recruitment agency to fill the new position.

Pedro:  No, I’m not.  There are so many Internet jo b boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using headhunte rs.

Wendy:  But headhunters do a good job of weeding ou t people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.

Pedro:  Yes, but they also charge a large commissio n.  I’m going to post an ad on a few major job boards to see what happens.  Mos t of them don’t charge a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.

Wendy:  I predict you’re going to be flooded with a pplications, and it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the ba d.

Pedro:  That’s where you come in.

Wendy:  What do you mean?

Pedro:  You are my assistant, aren’t you?

Wendy:  Yes.

Pedro:  And your job is to assist me, right?

Wendy:  Yes.

Pedro:  Good.  Roll up your sleeves and get ready f or a busy week!

Wendy begins our dialogue by saying to Pedro, “I ju st heard that you’re not going to use a recruitment agency to fill the new positio n.”  “To recruit” means to find someone to do a job or to become a member of an org anization.  So, a “recruitment agency” is a company that goes out and  finds people for you to hire, people who would be qualified to work in a position  that you need to fill.  When we use the verb “to fill” (fill) when talking about  jobs we mean to hire someone for a particular job, to find someone to work for your company.  So, we might talk about “filling a position” – the “position” is the job.  “To fill it” is to find someone who you will hire – who you will employ – to work a t that job.

Pedro says, “No, I’m not.”  I’m not going to use a recruitment agency to fill the new position.  He says, “There are so many Internet  job boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using hea dhunters.”  A “job board” is a collection of different jobs and their descriptions .  It’s actually more technically a place where you advertise jobs.  In the old days, b efore the Internet, sometimes companies – and I know the government often did thi s – they would put new job announcements on a physical board in some building,  and you could go down and look at the board and look at the new, we would  call them, “job postings,” because “to post” means to place a piece of paper o r an announcement in a place that other people can see it, as on a big boa rd or wall.  You could go and look at these job postings on a job board, which wa s a physical place in a building that you could go and visit.  Well nowaday s, we talk about job boards on the Internet, we mean websites where you can go and  look for new jobs, because they have descriptions of new jobs placed o r posted there.

Pedro says that there are so many Internet job boar ds “out there,” meaning in existence, “that I think we can find good candidate s without using headhunters.” A “candidate” (candidate) is a person who you are t hinking about hiring for a job, or a person who wants to be considered for the job that you are hiring for.  A “headhunter” is a person whose job it is to find a good person for the job you’re looking for.  A lot of times big companies don’t wa nt to go through the time of trying to find a good candidate to fill a position,  so they’ll hire a recruitment

agency, and the people in the agency will go out an d “hunt,” or look for “heads,” people who could work for that company.  Many times  these are people who are already working at other companies.  The headhunter  will approach them – will call them and say, “Hey, would you like to work for  this company over here?” That’s what a headhunter does; he or she is a recru iter, a person who goes out and finds people for jobs.

Wendy says, “But headhunters do a good job of weedi ng out people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.”  “To weed (weed) out (someone)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to eliminate or get  rid of the least desirable members of a large group of items, to only keep the  best ones.  “We’re going to weed out all of the bad or not qualified candidates .”  Sometimes we call them “applicants.”  People who apply for a job are peopl e who want to be hired for a job, and so from the verb “to apply” we get the nou n “applicant.”  So we’re going to weed out the bad or unqualified applicants, or u nqualified candidates.  “To weed out” means to get rid of the bad ones, and kee p the good ones to look at those more closely.  “Weed” has a lot of different meanings in English – and I mean a lot of different meanings!  Take a look at o ur Learning Guide for some of those.

So, Wendy is concerned because she thinks the headh unters would do a better job of weeding people out who don’t have the right qualifications – the right abilities or skills.  Pedro says, “Yes, but headhun ters also charge a large commission.”  “They charge” means they make you pay , you have to pay them a certain amount of money.  We call the amount of mon ey that they get sometimes a “commission.”  A “commission” is a fee or a price  that you pay someone to do some sort of service.  It’s often a percentage of s ome other value.  For example, if the person’s first year salary is, I don’t know,  50,000 dollars the headhunter may get a one percent fee or a three percent fee, m eaning that you have to pay them one percent of their first year salary.  I don ’t know exactly what the percentages are, but that would be an example of a commission.  If you sell a car at a car dealership – a place that sells new and us ed cars – the salesperson – you – would get a commission.  You would get a perc entage, so if you sell a more expensive car you get more money because you’r e being what we would say “paid on commission,” meaning you get a percent age of the amount that you sell.  So 10 percent, obviously, would be more mone y if you sold a 100,000-dollar car than if you sold a 50,000-dollar car.  I’ve nev er owned a 50,000-dollar car, certainly not a 100,000-dollar car, more like a 15, 000-dollar car, that’s – that’s my kind of car!

Anyway, Pedro says that he’s going to post an ad on  a few major, or important, job boards to see what happens.  “To post,” I menti oned earlier, means to place

something somewhere.  An “ad” is short for an adver tisement.  It’s an announcement that asks you to buy something or, in this case, to apply for a job. Pedro says that most of the job boards don’t charge  a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.  A “fee” is a price that you pay for something.  A “listing fee” is the amount of money you have to pay to post your announ cement or your message in a certain place; in this case, on the website.  The expression “there’s no harm in trying” is used to show that you may not be doin g something that is going to be successful, but it doesn’t matter because there’s n o reason not to do it; there’s no price or no cost associated with it.  If something good happens, good; if something doesn’t it’s no big deal, it doesn’t matt er because it didn’t cost you anything or there’s no bad thing that will happen i f you do this thing.  That’s what “harm” is; “harm” is a negative consequence of some thing, something bad that happens.  Pedro says, “there’s no harm in trying,” meaning, again, it’s okay, even if it doesn’t work we haven’t lost anything.

Wendy says, “I predict” – I believe this will happe n in the future – “I predict you’re going to be flooded with applications.”  “To be flo oded (flooded) with (something)” means to receive a lot of something, more than you can handle, more than you can take care of.  “Applications” are forms or docu ments or emails from people who want the job you are advertising, who are expre ssing interest in the job, who are applicants, who are potential candidates for the job.  Wendy says, “it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the  bad,” meaning the good applications or good candidates from the bad applic ations.

Pedro says, “That’s where you come in.”  This expre ssion, “that’s where you come in,” or “that’s where I come in” or “that’s wh ere he comes in,” is used to identify what another person’s job will be in a cer tain project that you’re describing.  So for example, I have a lot of essays  to grade.  I’m a teacher; I’m a professor; I have a lot of papers I have to look at .  And so I say to my teaching assistant, the person who is helping me teach the c lass, I say, “Well, I have all these papers to grade, and that’s where you come in ,” meaning you’re going to do the work.  Pedro is telling Wendy that she’s goi ng to go through these applications and weed out the bad ones.

Wendy says, “What do you mean?”  Pedro says, “You a re my assistant, aren’t you?”  Wendy says, “Yes.”  “And your job is to assi st me, right?” Pedro says. Wendy says, “Yes.”  Pedro says, “Good.  Roll up you r sleeves and get ready for a busy week!”  “To roll (roll) up your sleeves (sle eves)” means to prepare to work very hard.  Your “sleeves” are the parts of your sh irt or jacket that cover your arms.  So if you’re going to roll them up, you’re g oing to pull them back so that it’s up, maybe halfway up your arm.  The idea is th at when you’re going to work really hard on something you may need to roll up yo ur sleeves, you may need to

put your sleeves back so that your hands are free, your arms are free to work very hard.  The expression in general means to prep are to work very hard, and that’s what Wendy is going to have to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
