This episode is a dialogue between Kathy and Brett about designing a building. Let's get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Kathy: Seeing these blueprints really brings this p roject to life. I can now envision what this building will look like when it’s built. 

Brett: I’m really glad. As the architect on this pr oject, it’s my job to turn your ideas into design.  

Kathy: You did a great job.  

Brett: I had the help of the surveyors and a civil engineer, so I can’t take all of the credit.  

Kathy: We’re ready now to solicit bids from general  contractors, don’t you think? 

Brett: These plans will give any contractor the spe cifications they need to give a detailed and accurate bid. There’ll be no problems with permits, I don’t think, because a similar structure was on this building si te about 10 years ago before it was torn down. 

Kathy: I’m hoping not to run into any stumbling blo cks, but you never know with a building project. I’ll know we’ve cleared the hurdl es when I can bring in the interior designers!

Our dialogue begins with Kathy saying to Brett, “Se eing these blueprints really brings this project to life.” “Blueprints” are deta iled drawings of what you need to build a certain building. It's the plan of the buil ding – where the rooms go, where the doors go, and so forth. It's called the “bluepr int” because traditionally it was printed on paper in blue ink. That's why we have th e name “blueprint.” The word “blueprint” is used also in a more general way to r efer to the plan of something, especially a detailed plan about how to carry out o r execute a certain task.  

Kathy says, “Seeing these blueprints really brings this project to life.” “To bring something to life” means to make it real, to do som ething that allows other people to visualize it, to see how it will look like, and also to believe that it will happen. Kathy says seeing the blueprints “brings this proje ct to life.” She says, “I can now envision what this building will look like when it' s built.” “To envision” (envision) means to imagine something – so much so that you ca n almost see it in your mind. You have a clear picture or a clear idea of w hat something will look like. You can envision things that aren't just physical o bjects. You can envision the success that you might have by completing a certain  task.  

Brett says, “I'm really glad” – I'm very happy. “As  the architect on this project, it's my job to turn your ideas into design.” An “archite ct” (architect) is a person who designs buildings, who plans out what the building will look like and makes detailed drawings – plans that the people who are g oing to build the building look at in order to do their job. The architect’s job, a ccording to Brett, is to turn the ideas of the person who wants the building built in to the design. “To turn something into” something else means to transform i t, to change it in such a way that it is now this other thing. In this case, we’r e talking about taking ideas and changing them or “turning them into” design. “Desig n” here refers to how something will look or how it will function.  

Kathy says, “You did a great job.” Brett responds, “I had the help of the surveyors and a civil engineer, so I can't take all of the cr edit.” A “surveyor” (surveyor) is a person who makes very detailed measurements in orde r to determine where something is located. Usually, a surveyor is used w hen you are going to build a new house or building. The surveyor determines the exact size of the property, often where the property you own begins and where i t ends. People sometimes have surveyors come out when, for example, there ma y be some disagreement over where your property ends and where your neighb or’s property begins; a surveyor would help you determine that. Usually, su rveyors produce what are essentially maps of a certain area of land.  

Brett also used a civil engineer on this project. A  “civil (civil) engineer” is a person whose job it is to help with the design and the con struction, or building, of things  

like bridges, roads, and other similar structures. Brett says that because he got help from these other people, he can't take all of the credit. “To take all of the credit” means to say, “Yes, I deserve the praise th at you are giving me. I deserve all the nice things you are saying about me.” That would be to accept or “to take all of the credit.” Here, Brett says he cannot take  all of the credit because he didn't work on this project alone.  

Kathy says, “We’re ready now to solicit bids from g eneral contractors, don't you think?” “To solicit (solicit) bids (bids)” means to  go out and find people who want to do your project and who will give you a price fo r completing your project. It doesn't have to be a building project. It could be anything that you are hiring someone else to help you complete. It could be a pr oject related to software or computers or almost anything, really, that would re quire you to pay someone else to do work for you. When you solicit bids, you're u sually asking for detailed information and plans about how this person or comp any will complete the task.  

A “general contractor” is a person who manages a co nstruction project, sometimes doing some of the work himself, but usual ly bringing in other people – other companies or other workers – to complete some  of the more specialized work. The general contractor will often bring in wh at are called “subcontractors.” These are people who work under the direction of th e general contractor in order to finish, for example, the plumbing or the electri cal system in a building.  

Brent says these plans will give contractors “the s pecifications they need to give a detailed and accurate bid.” “Specifications” are detailed instructions for following a plan, especially when you are creating something new, as we are here in this building. Specifications will allow th e contractors “to give a detailed and accurate bid.” Something that is “accurate” (ac curate) is something that is correct, something that is “exactly correct,” we mi ght say.  

Brett also tells Kathy there won't be any “problems  with permits, I don't think.” “Permits” (permits) refers to official permission t o do something, usually involved in modifying – changing – or constructing a new bui lding. When you do work on your house, for example – by, I don't know, putting  in a new bathroom – you have to go to the city where you live and get a permit. Basically what you're doing is paying a tax, in a way, to the city so that you can  build something or change something to your current house.  

Often, permits require someone from the government – from the city government or local government – to come out and look at or “i nspect” your construction to make sure that everything is being done correctly a nd according to the laws or the “codes” (codes) for building. “Codes” are basic ally regulations that the  

government has about how you have to build a house or a building. Brett says he doesn't think there will be any problems with permi ts. This, of course, is what people involved in construction often tell you. “We ll, I don't think there'll be any problems.” They’re not actually promising there won 't be any problems.  

Brett says there was a similar structure, or buildi ng, “on this building site about 10 years ago before it was torn down.” A “building sit e” is a place where you are going to build something, a piece of land where you  are going to construct your building. “To tear (tear) down” something is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to destroy something, usually a building – a house or some other structure. Brett says the building was “torn (torn) down.” “Torn” is  the past tense of “tear.”  

Kathy says, “I'm hoping not to run into any stumbli ng blocks, but you never know with a building project.” Kathy says she's hoping n ot “to run into” – or to encounter or to have – “any stumbling blocks.” A “s tumbling (stumbling) block” is an obstacle, something that makes progress on a pro ject more difficult. Kathy says, “I’ll know we've cleared the hurdles when I c an bring in the interior designers!” The expression “to clear (clear) the hu rdles (hurdles)” means to deal with the difficulties and the challenges and the pr oblems that you have so that you can complete your task.  

A “hurdle” here means the same as an obstacle. Lite rally, a “hurdle” is something that you jump over in a race. If you watch the Olym pics, the Summer Olympics, they’ll have a race where the runners have to jump over things. Those things that they jump over are called “hurdles.” “To clear the hurdle” means to jump over it without hitting it – to jump over it successfully. We use that idea of the hurdle to mean more generally to overcome difficulties or pro blems.  

Kathy refers to “interior designers.” The “interior ” (interior) of the building is the inside. So, an “interior designer” is the person wh o is responsible for deciding how the inside of the building will look – what col or the walls will be, what kind of furniture will be in the building, and so forth. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
