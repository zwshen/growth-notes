<br />
<br />

Once upon a time, three girls - Winnie, Grace and Bonnie - owned a large number of pearls. However, each of them only had a single color of pearls. Winnie had white pearls, Grace had grey pearls and Bonnie had black pearls. One day, after a long discussion, they decided to make necklaces using the pearls. They are interested in knowing how many patterns can be formed using a certain number of pearls of each color, and have asked you to solve this problem for them.<br />
<br />
Note that rotating or flipping over a necklace cannot produce a different kind of necklace. i.e. The following figure shows three equivalent necklaces.<br />

<br />
The following figure shows all possible necklaces formed by 3 white pearls, 2 grey pearls and 1 black pearl.<br />

<b>Input</b><br />
The input begins with an integer <i>N</i> (<span style='font-size:10pt'>&le;</span> 2500) which indicates the number of test cases followed. Each of the following test cases consists of three non-negative integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, where 3 <span style='font-size:10pt'>&le;</span> <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i> <span style='font-size:10pt'>&le;</span> 40.<br />
<br />

<b>Output</b><br />
For each test case, print out the number of different necklaces that formed by <i>a</i> white pearls, <i>b</i> grey pearls and <i>c</i> black pearls in a single line.<br />
<br />

<b>Sample input</b><br />
<div class="io">
2<br />
3 2 1<br />
2 2 2<br />
</div>
<br />

<b>Sample output</b><br />
