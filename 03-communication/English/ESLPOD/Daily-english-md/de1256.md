This episode is a dialogue between Jerome and Elise  about speaking fast and slow. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: Did you hear what the speaker said?

Elise: No, I didn’t catch that either. She’s racing  through her presentation like she’s late for her train.

Jerome: I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of s peech that it’s dizzying. I wish she’d slow down so I could make out what she’s sayi ng. Most of it is mumbled or garbled.

Elise: She’s got to be breaking a record for the nu mber of words per minute. Hey wait, she’s done. The next speaker has to be better .

Jerome: Oh my God, she’s worse! She must be the slo west speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sentence seems int erminable. She just keeps droning on and on and on.

Elise: At least we can understand her.

Jerome: Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pace. She ’s making a lengthy speech even longer. At this rate, we’ll be here until midn ight!

Elise: Maybe we should try to pay attention and tak e notes like we’re supposed to.

Jerome: How can we when her voice is so hypnotic?

 Elise: I know what you mean. I think I need some co ffee. Do you want some?

Jerome: [snores]

Elise: Jerome, Jerome!

Jerome says to Elise, “Did you hear what the speake r said?” A “speaker” (speaker) here refers to a person who is talking or  giving a speech in front of other people, in front of a group of people. The wo rd “speaker” can also refer to an electronic device that you hear sounds out of. S o, if you’re listening, for example, to the radio, you are probably listening t o the sound coming out of a speaker. You could also have headphones or ear buds  as well that go right into your ear. Jerome, however, is talking about a perso n who is speaking, who is talking.

Elise says, “No, I didn’t catch that either.” “To c atch” (catch) here means to understand or to recognize something, especially so mething that is being told to you. If you have difficulty hearing someone, you ma y say, “I didn’t catch that,” meaning I didn’t understand it or I didn’t hear it properly. Elise isn’t able to understand what the speaker is saying either. She s ays, “She’s racing through her presentation like she’s late for her train.” “T o race” (race) means to do something very quickly, very fast. Elise is saying that the speaker is talking very fast.

She’s “racing through her presentation” – the infor mation she’s giving to people – “like she’s late for her train.” If you are “late f or your train,” you may miss your train because you may arrive at the train station t oo late. So of course you’re going to move very quickly so you don’t miss your t rain. Well that’s what Elise is comparing the speaker to – a person who is moving v ery quickly. Jerome says, “I know. She speaks at such a fast rate of speech that  it’s dizzying.” Your “rate (rate) of speech” is how fast you talk. I’m talking  at a slow rate of speech right now, compared to how fast I might speak to someone else.

The rate of speech of the speaker, according to Jer ome, is “dizzying” (dizzying). Something that is “dizzying” makes you dizzy. “To b e dizzy” means to be confused. Usually you feel as though you may fall d own, or you feel, we would say, “disoriented.” If someone hits you on the head , you may feel dizzy. Your head might begin to seem as though it is spinning a round as though it is moving

around in circles. If something is “dizzying” becau se it’s fast, it is so fast it’s making you confused, and that’s what Jerome means h ere.

He says, “I wish she’d slow down,” meaning speak mo re slowly, “so I could make out what she’s saying.” “To make out” is a two-word  phrasal verb that here means to be able to understand something that is ot herwise unclear. “To make out” means to recognize or to understand something.  There’s another completely different meaning of the phrasal verb “to make out. ” In informal English, “to make out” means to kiss and otherwise touch someone to w hom you are romantically attracted. That’s a very different meaning than wha t we have here.

Jerome continues, “Most of it,” meaning most of wha t the speaker is saying, “is mumbled or garbled.” “Mumbled” (mumbled) means said  in a way that is difficult to understand. The verb “to mumble” is to say somet hing usually in a low voice – that is, not very loudly – and in a way that is dif ficult for other people to understand. Young children sometimes mumble. They s peak like: [mumbles]. They speak in a way that is opposite of the way I’m  speaking now, which is very clearly.

The same is true with the adjective “garbled” (garb led). “Garbled” means unclear or confusing. Often “garbled” means more specifical ly to be mixed up – perhaps two different people are talking at the same time, or there’s a lot of noise while someone is talking and so you can’t hear things cle arly. That’s a little different than “mumbled.” “Mumbled” refers specifically to so meone who is speaking at a low volume and not very clearly.

Elise continues, “She’s got to be breaking a record  for the number of words per minute.” “To break a record” here means to be doing  something, in this case, faster than anyone else has done it. A “record” (re cord) is the highest or greatest accomplishment that anyone has made in that particu lar area. In sports, we often talk about “world records” – the fastest person in the world, or the fastest that anyone has ever run. Well, Elise says that the spea ker is breaking a record for the “number of words per minute” – that is, the num ber of words that you speak each minute, each sixty seconds.

“Hey wait,” Elise says, “she’s done,” meaning she’s  finished. She’s completed her speech. “The next speaker has to be better,” El ise says. She means that the next speaker cannot be any worse than the one they just heard. But that isn’t true. Jerome says, “Oh my God, she’s worse. She mus t be the slowest speaker alive. Every utterance is drawn-out and every sente nce seems interminable.” An “utterance” (utterance) is another word for somethi ng that is said or spoken.

Sometimes we think of an “utterance” as being a sen tence, although that’s not always true.

“To be drawn (drawn) – out” means to be made to las t longer than it should, to take more time than is necessary. Sometimes you’ll go to a movie and it will be very “drawn-out.” The story will be made much longe r than it needs to be. That’s usually a boring movie. “Every sentence seems inter minable” (interminable). Something which is “interminable” is something that  doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to end, something that is very long and usual ly very boring as well.

Jerome says, “She keeps droning on and on and on.” “To drone (drone) on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to speak for a very l ong time in a boring and uninteresting way. “I’m going to now talk about all  the things that I’m interested in. First, I will tell you about my first day at sc hool.” That’s “to drone on” – to talk for a long time in a way that isn’t very interestin g. Elise says, however, “At least we can understand her,” meaning well, even though s he’s boring, we can understand what she’s saying, which is unlike the p revious speaker.

Jerome says, “Yes, but I wish she’d pick up the pac e” (pace). “To pick up the pace” is to increase the speed of something or to i ncrease how fast you are doing something – in this case, how fast she is spe aking. Jerome says, “She’s making a lengthy speech even longer.” “Lengthy” (le ngthy) means lasting a long time, taking a long time. “At this rate,” Jerome sa ys, “we’ll be here until midnight.” “At this rate” (rate) means if we continue going at  this speed. Jerome is saying that if the woman keeps speaking so slowly, they wi ll be there listening to her until midnight – presumably many hours in the futur e.

Elise says, “Maybe we should try to pay attention a nd take notes like we’re supposed to.” She’s suggesting to Jerome that they actually listen to the speaker and maybe write some things down about what she is saying. Jerome says, “How can we,” meaning how can we do that, “when her  voice is so hypnotic?” “Hypnotic” (hypnotic) is someone who either makes y ou feel tired and sleepy because the way they are speaking is slow and unint eresting, or just the opposite – someone is so interesting that you feel as though  you are under their control.

The word “hypnotic” comes from “hypnosis,” which is  the process supposedly of making someone go into a certain mental state in wh ich the person can perhaps be given certain suggestions that will affect his o r her actions or behavior in the future. In movies and on television, you often see someone being hypnotized by taking an object such as a little watch and making the watch go back and forth in front of the person’s eyes until they somehow fall asleep or fall into this different mental state.

 That’s where the word “hypnotic” comes from. Again it’s an unusual word. Here, it’s being used to mean someone is so boring that y ou’re falling asleep, but it can also be used as an adjective to describe someone wh o is very interesting. So interesting that you are almost in a hypnotic state  and that person could control you because the person is so interesting, and perha ps so persuasive. Jerome thinks the second speaker is hypnotic.

Elise says, “I know what you mean. I think I need s ome coffee. Do you want some?” In the meantime, Jerome has actually fallen asleep. He makes a noise because he begins “to snore” (snore). “To snore” is  to make a noise with your mouth and/or nose while you are sleeping. That is a n example of “snoring.” Jerome has fallen asleep because he starts to snore .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: Did you hear what the speaker said?

Elise: No, I didn’t catch that either. She’s racing  through her presentation like she’s late for her train.

Our dialogues are never interminable. They’re alway s short and sweet – that is, they don’t take long, but there’s a lot of good thi ngs in them. We thank our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse, for that.
