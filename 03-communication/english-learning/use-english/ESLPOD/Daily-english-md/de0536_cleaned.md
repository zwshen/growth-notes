This episode is called “Using a Computer Keyboard,” somet hing that all of us probably do every day.  It’s going to talk about some specif ic vocabulary we use when talking about a keyboard.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Leslie:  This keyboard is so hard to use.  I can’t find wh ere anything is! 

Dave:  It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.  The layout may be  a little different, with the function keys on the right-hand side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time. 

Leslie:  That’s what you think.  I don’t need an ergono mic wireless keyboard.  I liked my old one. 

Dave:  Everybody in the office is getting one, so you weren ’t singled out.  Okay, let me give you a quick orientation.  The keyboard has a built-in number pad, and all you need to do is press the “num lock” key to use it.  The escape (“esc”) key is over here, and the “control,” “alt,” and “shift” keys a re on the bottom.   

Leslie:  Where’s the “caps lock”?   

Dave:  It’s on your left.   

Leslie:  But my old keyboard had a bunch of hotkeys.  What am I supposed to do without them?  

 Dave:  You can program your function keys to act as hotkeys.  Do you want me to show you how to do that? 

Leslie:  I guess so.  Since I’m stuck with this keyboard, I g uess I have to live with it. 

Dave:  That’s the spirit!

Leslie begins our dialogue by saying, “This keyboard is so h ard to use.”  The “keyboard,” as you probably know, is the flat, rectangula r part of the computer that has buttons on it that you press down in order to e nter information into a computer.  Leslie says, “I can’t find where anything is (I can’t locate anything)!”   

Dave says, “It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.”  “QWERTY” (QW ERTY) is used to describe a keyboard design, the most common keyboard desig n in English, where the letters Q-W-E-R-T-Y are the first letters i n the top row when you read them from left to right.  This is a QWERTY keyboard, Da ve says, “The layout may be a little different, with the function keys on the  right side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time.”  A “lay out” is a way that we organize things; it’s the position of individual pieces of somethi ng.  You can talk about the layout of a house, how the house is designed – where the  bedrooms are, where the bathrooms are.  “Layout,” here, refers to the po sition of the keys – the “keys” are the buttons that you press, that’s why we call it a keyboard.  The position of the keys is the layout for the keyboard.  Dave is saying that  the function keys for this keyboard are on the right-hand side – on the right  of the keyboard – instead of on the top.  “Function keys” are the ones that say “F1 , F2, F3,” and so on to “F12” that are used in some computers for specific comman ds, things that the computer does if you press one of those keys.   

Dave says that Leslie will get used to it in no time, me aning very quickly.  Leslie says, “That’s what you think,” meaning that’s your opinion,  but it isn’t true. “That’s what you think.  I don’t need an ergonomic wire less keyboard.  I liked my old one.”  The word “ergonomic” (ergonomic) is an adj ective we use to describe equipment, technology, or furniture that is made to be  more efficient to use, so that it doesn’t hurt your body.  For example, an ergon omic chair would be a chair that you could sit in for a long time and it wouldn’t hurt your back.  An ergonomic keyboard is designed so that you can use it without hurting  your hands – without getting any sort of pain in your hands.  It’s supposed t o be designed to prevent that.  “Wireless” keyboards are keyboards that you don’t h ave a physical wire to  

 connect the keyboard to the computer.  Wireless – without wires.  Many keyboards and mouses nowadays are wireless, my keyboard and mo use are wireless for example. 

Leslie said she liked her old keyboard.  Dave says, “Everybody i n the office is getting one (is getting these new keyboards), so you were n’t singled out.”  “To single (someone) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to treat  someone differently than everyone else, especially if it’s something a person  doesn’t like.  For example, the teacher may say, “Everyone needs to write a f ive-page essay (a five-page paper),” and one of the students complains abo ut it, the teacher could say, “Well, you are not being singled out.  Everyone has to do this.”  So, Leslie is not being singled out.  By the way, the word “single” has a couple of different meanings in English.  For those meanings, take a look at our Learning Guide for this episode. 

Dave says, “Okay, let me give you a quick orientation.”  The  word “orientation,” here, means an overview, when someone gives you basic infor mation to make you familiar with something, to give you some important  information.  When you start a new job you may attend a company orientation, wh ere they give you information about things that are important for you to know in that company. “Orientation,” however, has other meanings, just like th e word “single.”  You can find those meanings in our Learning Guide for this epi sode. 

Dave says, “This keyboard has a built-in number pad.”  When  we say something is “built-in,” we’re describing something that is a per manent part of something else; it wasn’t added separately, it was made that way.  For example, you could have a built-in closet (that is a place where you keep your  clothes).  In my room – in my bedroom, I have a built-in closet.  It’s not a sepa rate piece of furniture that we bought and put in my room, it was part of the room ; it was built that way. “Built” is the past tense of “build.”  So, something t hat is “built-in” is a permanent part of it.  Many keyboards have a built-in number pad .  The “number pad” is a small, usually square or rectangular part of a keyboard t hat has just numbers as well as a few mathematical symbols.  Number pads are usefu l for entering numbers in very quickly.  In fact, some people are very fast  when they use their number pads.  Dave says, “all you need to do is press the ‘n um lock’ key to use it.”  On some keyboards the number pad is separate from t he rest of the keys.  In some keyboards, however, it’s part of the keys, and you have to press a special key – a special button to use it, and that is typically calle d the “num (num) lock” (“num” stands for “number”).   

He says, “The escape key (‘esc’) is over here.”  On a keyboard,  “esc” means escape, often used to get out of a program or to perha ps undo something that  

 you did.  He says, “the ‘control,’ ‘alt’ (alt), and ‘shi ft’ keys are on the bottom.” These are special keys used on keyboards for specific commands or functions on computers.  The “control” key is usually pressed with anot her key to do something in a computer program.  For example, on Wind ows, when you are in the program Microsoft Word and you press control-z (the letter “z”) you will undo your previous action.  The “alt” key is similar; the alt key is usually pressed with another key to do something.  It’s often used to open me nus in a computer program.  The “shift” key is the key you press to make capi tal letters (to make large letters).  It’s also, again, used as part of a com mand sometimes.  If you press control-alt-delete on a Windows machine that usuall y will turn your computer off; it will shut it down or give you that opt ion. 

Leslie says, “Where’s the ‘caps lock’?”  The “caps lock” is the key, usually on the left side of the keyboard, that when pressed makes all of  the letters capital letters.  It’s like having the shift key always being pressed .  The word “caps” (caps) stands for “capitals” or “capital letters.”   

Dave says to Leslie, “The caps lock is on your left.”  Leslie says, “But my old keyboard had a bunch of hotkeys.”  “Hotkeys” are additional  keys or buttons that you can press to make the computer do certain things.  On so me computer programs, you can often “program” the hotkeys, make certai n combination of keys or certain keys command buttons so that when you press the m something happens right away.  Leslie says, “What am I supposed to do without them?” This Leslie really likes to complain, doesn’t she?  Dave sa ys, “You can program your function keys to act as hotkeys.  Do you want me to show yo u how to do that?”  Leslie says, “I guess so.  Since I’m stuck with this ke yboard, I guess I have to live with it.”  “To be stuck with (something)” me ans to be forced to do something or be forced to use something that you don’t want to use.  Leslie feels that she’s stuck with this keyboard, meaning she doesn’t ha ve any other choice, but she’s not very happy about it.  Leslie is a very unhapp y person, it seems! She says, “I guess I have to live with it.”  “To have to l ive with (something)” means you have to put up with it, you have to tolerate i t. 

Dave jokingly says, “That’s the spirit!”  Normally, “that’s the spirit” is a phrase used to encourage the other person to continue doing what they are doing, to have a positive attitude.  But here, it’s used sarcasticall y, as a joke, since Leslie has a very negative attitude.  I think Leslie needs to lo ok for a new job, personally! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
