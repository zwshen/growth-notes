[start of dialogue]

Karam: You and Daniel have been dating for over a y ear. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?

Raphaela: I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believ e in following conventions. We’re both open to an unconventional relationship.

Karam: What kind of unconventional relationship?

Raphaela: Many different kinds. We’re very open-min ded.

Karam: Okay, for instance, would you guys be open t o polygamy? Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse wit h someone else.

Raphaela: Well, no, I don’t think that would be rig ht for us. The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it b ecomes, I think.

Karam: Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriag e.

Raphaela: That’s probably not something I’d want.

Karam: The only other unconventional marriages I ca n think of are arranged marriages and May-December romances. Neither of tho se applies to you and Daniel. Am I missing something?

Raphaela: Well, we’d be open to living apart. We’re  both very independent and would want to retain that independence.

 Karam: Ah, then there’s my answer. I know what kind  of unconventional marriage you’d have.

Raphaela: What?

Karam: A relationship without cohabitating? Dating.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Karam saying to Raphaela , “You and Daniel have been dating for over a year. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?” “To tie (tie) the knot” means to get married. It’s another expres sion meaning to get married. Raphaela says, “I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believe in following conventions.” The word “conventions” (conventions) refers here to standards, or the commonly accepted way of doing things.

Raphaela says, “We’re both open to an unconventiona l relationship.” “Unconventional” means not usual, or unusual. In th is case, a relationship that would not be what you would normally think between two people. Karam is not sure exactly what Raphaela means. He says, “What ki nd of unconventional relationship?” Raphaela says, “Many different kinds .” She doesn’t give him a specific answer. She does say that she and Daniel a re “open-minded.” “To be open-minded” means to be willing to consider new id eas, to be willing to accept things that are perhaps unconventional.

Karam then says, “Okay, for instance” – meaning for  example – “would you guys be open to polygamy?” “Polygamy” (polygamy) is the practice of having more than one wife or more than one husband at a time. N ow, contrary to what some people think, polygamy is not legal in any state or  territory of the United States. I have heard some people who thought that this was tr ue, but it definitely is not.

Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some peopl e who live in what are, in effect, polygamous relationships, but they are not legally married. You can only be legally married to one person at a time, at leas t here in the U.S. Why you would want to have more than one wife, for example,  I have no idea. Clearly someone who believes in that hasn’t been married be fore – but anyway, back to our story.

Karam says, “Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse with someone else.” “To be able to picture” (picture) so meone is to imagine someone in a certain situation. Karam is saying that he can not imagine that either Daniel or

Raphaela would be willing to share his or her “spou se” (spouse). Your spouse is either your husband or your wife, depending on who you are.

Raphaela says, “Well, no, I don’t think that would be right for us,” meaning she doesn’t want to be in a polygamous relationship. Sh e says, “The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it b ecomes.” Karam says, “Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriage.” “To be open to” means to be willing to consider, to be willing to try. Karam is asking if Daniel and Raphaela would be willing to try an open marriage.

An “open marriage” is a marriage, I’m told, where t he husband and wife agree that they can have sexual relationships with people  outside of the marriage and yet still remain married. Now, this is different th an someone having an “affair” (affair). When you have an affair, you have sexual relations with someone who is not your husband or wife, without the husband or wi fe knowing about it. An open relationship is when you know about it, I guess. Ra phaela says, “That’s probably not what I want.” So she doesn’t want that either. So Karam is confused. He’s trying to find out exactly what Raphaela is talking  about.

He then says, “The only other unconventional marria ges I can think of are arranged marriages and May-December romances.” An “ arranged (arranged) marriage” is a marriage where the husband and wife are chosen for each other, usually by the parents. This is still done in some societies, where the parents decide who their children will marry. I did not and  do not have an arranged marriage. My parents did not select my wife. In fac t, when they met my then girlfriend, they advised her not to marry me, but f ortunately she didn’t listen. Maybe she should have.

Karam also mentions “May-December romances.” A “May -December romance” is a romantic relationship between two people with a significant difference in age. The man may be 60, and the woman may be 25. That wo uld be definitely a “May- December romance.” That happens all the time here i n Los Angeles. The rich male movie star will marry the young actress or mod el.

Karam says, “Neither of those applies to you and Da niel,” meaning neither the arranged marriage nor the May-December romance. “To  apply to” something means to be relevant to something – to be, we might  also say, “applicable to” a certain situation. Karam says, “Am I missing someth ing?” When someone asks, “Am I missing something,” he is saying, “Is there s omething I don’t understand; is there some information I don’t have?”

Raphaela says, “Well, we’re open to living apart. W e’re both very independent and would want to retain that independence.” “To li ve apart” means to live in separate houses or separate apartments. Raphaela sa ys that she and Daniel are “both very independent” and would like to or “would  want to retain (retain) that independence.” “To retain” something is to keep it,  to continue to have it.

Karam says, “Ah, then there’s my answer.” Now he un derstands. “I know what kind of unconventional marriage you have.” And Raph aela asks him, “What?” – what kind? Karam says, “A relationship without coha bitating? Dating,” he says. “To cohabitate” (cohabitate) means to live together  in the same house with someone with whom you’re having a romantic relation ship. Most conventional or regular, normal marriages have the husband and wife  living in the same house.

Karam is saying that Raphaela is talking about a re lationship without cohabitating, which is really just another name for  dating. “Dating” (dating) usually refers to the early stages of a romantic re lationship when traditionally you didn’t live with the person with whom you are havin g this romance.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
