This episode is a dialogue between Patrick and Mary  about going to a place where children can play – called a “playground,” of  course. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Patrick: Hi, do you mind if I sit on this bench wit h you? 

Mary: No, be my guest. We’ve just moved to the neig hborhood and we love having a playground around the corner. 

Patrick: It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to bring t he kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy? 

Mary: Definitely. I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider. It’s her favorite. Is that your son on the slide? 

Patrick: It is. Over there, I have two other sons p laying on the merry-go-round. They’re the ones wearing green. 

Mary: Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?  

Patrick: My son Frankie and daughter Terese are on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them? 

Mary: Oh, sure. Are those two on the seesaw yours, too? 

Patrick: They are, and those three boys on the swin gs are mine, too. Over there, you’ll see another one of my sons swinging on the t rapeze rings, and right here is my youngest playing in the sandbox. 

Mary: Wait, how many children do you have?  

 Patrick: Only 11.

A “playground” (playground) is an outdoor area wher e children can play, usually on large pieces of equipment, some of which we’ll b e talking about in this episode. Our dialogue begins with Patrick saying to  Mary, “Hi, do you mind” – meaning is it okay, or does it bother you – “if I s it on this bench with you?” A “bench” (bench) is a long, flat seat that usually t hree or four people can sit on. You find benches in parks, in bus stations, in othe r public areas. They are places where you can sit down. The bench here has room for  at least two people, since Patrick is asking to sit next to Mary. 

Mary responds to Patrick by saying, “No, be my gues t,” meaning no, it doesn’t bother me. I don’t mind. “Be my guest” (guest). The  phrase “Be my guest” is used when someone is asking something from you or reques ting something from you. Often it involves allowing the person to use someth ing or to do something that is involved somehow with that person. For example, you ’re sitting at a table, at a dinner table, and someone says, “Can I have that la st piece of apple pie” or “that last piece of cake?” The other person may respond “ Be my guest,” meaning “Go ahead, that’s fine. I don’t mind.” 

So Mary says to Patrick, “Be my guest,” meaning yes , you can sit next to me. She then says, “We’ve just moved to the neighborhoo d and we love having a playground around the corner.” Mary is talking abou t, we are guessing, herself and her family who have just moved to this neighbor hood, this area of the city. She says they “love having a playground around the corner.” “Around the corner” means very close to where you live.  

Patrick says, “It’s nice, isn’t it, to be able to b ring the kids here to get some exercise and to burn off some energy.” “Exercise” ( exercise) is things you do with your body, usually to make yourself healthier or st ronger, or perhaps for some people to lose weight. That’s called “exercise.” It  could be running. It could be doing other sorts of activities that require you to  work your body hard.  

“To burn (burn) off some energy (energy)” means, in  this case, to have the children do some physical activity so that later, t hey’re calmer or perhaps tired and want to go to sleep. Sometimes parents will tak e their children somewhere so that the children will run around, will do a lot  of activity or a lot of exercise, so that later the children are quiet because they’re t ired. Mary agrees with Patrick that it’s nice to be able to bring the kids to this  playground to get some exercise.   

 She says, “I’m watching my daughter on that spring rider.” A “spring (spring) rider (rider)” is something that you may find in a playgr ound. It often looks like an animal, or perhaps a car. It moves around and goes up and down when a child sits on it. It’s often made from wood or plastic. T he important thing in a “spring rider” is that it is attached to or connected to a metal spiral – something made of a very strong, long tube of metal that goes around and around in a circle. That’s called a “spring.”  

A “spring” is made out of a long, thin or thick pie ce of metal that is curled around. It goes around in a circle. We would call it a “coi l” (coil). If you push a spring down and then remove your hand, the spring will com e back up. Well, a “spring rider” isn’t so much about the child moving up and down, but more side to side, I think. To be honest, we didn’t have spring riders w hen I was a child at the playgrounds I used to go to, but I think that’s wha t it is. Mary says that her daughter is on a spring rider and that it’s her “fa vorite,” meaning it’s the ride or it’s the thing at the playground she likes the most.  

Then Mary asks Patrick, “Is that your son on the sl ide (slide)?” A “slide” can best be compared to a hill. When you go skiing, at least  downhill skiing, you go from the top of the hill to the bottom of the hill. A “s lide” is like an artificial hill except it isn’t wide. It’s very narrow and is usually made of  just a piece of metal that one person can slide down or go down from the top to th e bottom. To get to the top, you have to climb what is called a “ladder” (ladder ), which is like a series of steps that you go up.  

Patrick says that it is his son on the slide. He co ntinues, “Over there, I have two other sons playing on the merry-go-round. They’re t he ones wearing green.” A “merry (merry) – go (go) – round (round)” is a larg e, flat circle usually made of metal, and into the circle there are things that yo u can hang onto with your hands. This circle is attached to a pole in the mid dle of the circle, and it goes around in a circle. In order to make it go around, you have to push it so that it moves around. That’s a “merry-go-round.” Sometimes is called a “roundabout.”  

Now, if you go to a circus – a place that has anima ls, for example, and other games to play – you will also see a merry-go-round,  but that’s a little different. That’s a merry-go-round that is operated electronic ally. You don’t have to push it. And often, instead of just hanging onto a pole with  your hands, there are things that you sit on that are shaped like horses. That’s  a little different kind of merry- go-round. A playground merry-go-round is just typic ally a large round disc that goes around in a circle if you push it.  

Patrick says his two sons are on the merry-go-round . Mary says, “Oh, yeah, I see them. Do you have other kids?” “Do you have other c hildren?” Mary is asking. Patrick says, “My son Frankie and daughter Terese a re on the jungle gym hanging on the monkey bars. See them?” A “jungle (j ungle) gym (gym)” is something that kids can climb on. It is usually mad e of wood or metal and it can take a variety of different forms or shapes. “To ha ng” (hang) means to hold on to something, usually with your hands, while the rest of your body is not touching anything else.  

A “jungle gym” has high bars that kids can grab ont o or hang onto with their hands and arms. “Monkey (monkey) bars (bars)” is an other piece of playground equipment. It’s basically a ladder that is up in th e air, and horizontal rather than vertical. What you do is you jump up and you put yo ur hand on one of the bars. I guess we could call it one of the “rungs” (rungs). A ladder has what are called “rungs.” Those are basically the steps that you put  your feet on when you go up the ladder.  

A “monkey bar” is not a vertical structure, but rat her a horizontal one. So you have two other structures usually made out of metal  or wood that hold the monkey bars up in the air. So the monkey bars are b asically on top of these other structures. Monkey bars allow you to go from one en d of the ladder, if you will, one end of the monkey bars to the other. 

Mary sees Patrick’s two children and says, “Are tho se two on the seesaw yours, too?” meaning “yours, also?” A “seesaw” (seesaw) is  sometimes called a “teeter (teeter) – totter (totter).” A “teeter-totter” (say  that 10 times fast), or a “seesaw,” is basically a flat piece of wood or metal that is bal anced in the middle, allowing one child to go up and the other child to go down. So o ne child goes up and the other one goes down. In fact, we have a verb “to seesaw,”  which means to go up and down constantly.  

Patrick says yes, the two on the seesaw are his chi ldren. And he says, “Those three boys on the swings are mine, too.” “Swings” ( swings) are basically seats – things you sit on – that are connected to long chai ns, long thin ropes, or chains that are themselves connected to a high bar above y ou. The swing allows you to go back and forth in the air while sitting down.  

Patrick says, “Over there, you’ll see another one o f my sons swinging on the trapeze rings.” A “trapeze (trapeze) ring (ring)” i s a metal ring that is connected to a long piece of rope or a long chain that you can s wing from, back and forth, by holding onto it with your hands. Patrick also menti ons his youngest son “is playing in the sandbox” (sandbox). A “sandbox” is a  large box that is filled with,  

not surprisingly, “sand” – something that you would  find, say, on a beach by the ocean.  

Mary says, “Wait, how many children do you have?” P atrick responds, “Only 11.” Well, 11 is not that big of a family. I am the youn gest of 11 children. And by coincidence, by chance, my parents were named Patri ck and Mary.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
