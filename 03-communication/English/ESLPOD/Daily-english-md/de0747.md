This episode is a dialogue between Piero and Annie.   They’re going to something called a “ranch,” basically a large farm with many different kinds of animals.  Let’s get started.  Yee-haw!

[start of dialogue]

Piero:  What’s all this?

Annie:  I’m visiting my sister and brother-in-law’s  new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it.  I know I’m a city girl, but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.

Piero:  Well, you look the part.  You’ve got your c owboy hat, a lasso, and are those chaps?

Annie:  Yes, of course.  How else could I ride with  them on the cattle drive?

Piero:  Cattle drive?  Are you sure it’s a working ranch?

Annie:  I think so.  Why would they buy a ranch if they don’t plan to have horses and livestock?

Piero:  Don’t ask me.  What’s all that stuff in the  bags?

Annie:  That’s all equipment I’ll need to ride a ho rse: a bridle, a bit, and ta-da – my own saddle!

Piero:  This is all stuff that they should have at the ranch already, don’t you think?

Annie:  Yes, but I’ll need to go horseback riding t his weekend to practice.

Piero:  That’s a good idea.  Have you been riding h orses long?

Annie:  This weekend will be my first time.

Piero:  You’re riding a horse for the first time th is weekend and you plan to work at your sister’s ranch next month?

Annie:  Sure, how hard could it be?  It’s just like  riding a bike, right?

Piero begins by asking Annie, “What’s all this?”  W hat is all of this stuff?  What are all of these things?  Annie says, “I’m visiting  my sister and brother-in-law’s new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it.”   A “ranch” is a large farm that usually has lots of cows, horses, and other large a nimals on it.  We often talk about ranches especially here in the western part o f the United States, where there used to be very large amounts of land owned b y one or two people – a family typically – and they would use that land for  cows and horses and growing food.  The word “ranch” is, in American English, ty pically associated with states like Texas or Arizona or California, where there we re these large pieces of land that you would find animals on.

That’s where Annie’s going; she’s going to a ranch owned by her sister and her sister’s husband, which would be Annie’s brother-in -law.  She says, “I know I’m a city girl” – that is, she’s someone who is raised i n a city, not out on a farm, we would call that, perhaps, a “country girl” or “boy”  – “but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.”   “To fit in” or “to fit right in” means to be the same as everyone around you.  So, y ou’re wearing same kinds of clothes, you’re acting the same, you’re doing the same things; that’s to fit in. Annie wants to work alongside all of the other cowb oys.  “Alongside” (alongside – one word) means together with someone else; doing s omething with someone, standing next to them, or working with them.  “Cowb oys” are people, usually men, that ride horses, and they take care of the co ws and other large animals when they’re riding on their horses.  Cowboys are a n important part of Western United States culture, and that’s what Annie wants to do.

Piero says, “Well, you look the part.”  The express ion “to look the part” (part) means that you look the way people expect someone t o look, to dress, to act for that particular situation.  The word “part” here re fers to an actor or an actress who is playing a certain character in a TV show or movie or play.  Someone who,

for example, is in the play Romeo and Juliet  and is playing the character of Romeo would have what we would say the “part” of Ro meo.  “I have Romeo’s part,” meaning that’s the person I’m going to be in  the movie or in the play.  “To look the part” means that you look just like that p erson should look.

Piero observes that Annie has a cowboy hat, a lasso , and chaps.  A “cowboy hat” is a very large hat; I’m sure you’ve seen one.  It is made of a thick, soft fabric, traditionally worn by men although women can wear t hem, too.  They’re very much associated with Western U.S. culture.  You’ll see them in movies about the West.  A “lasso” (lasso) is a long rope with a larg e circle on it that can be used to throw at an animal, for example, in order to catch the animal.  “Chaps” (chaps) are clothing that’s similar to a pair of pants.  Th ey’re often made of leather. They’re actually worn over your pants to protect th em while you are riding a horse.  I do not have a cowboy hat, a lasso, or cha ps, and I’ve never ridden a horse, but I’ve seen movies, so I know what they ar e.

Annie says, “Yes, of course (she has these things).   How else could I ride with them (the cowboys) on the cattle drive?”  A “cattle  drive” refers to a process where you have several cowboys who work together to  move the cows – we would also call them “cattle” (cattle) – from one p lace to another over a very long distance.  So, it’s how you would move the animals if you were moving to another ranch, for example, or if you were taking them to b e sold somewhere.

Piero is surprised, he says, “Cattle drive?  Are yo u sure it’s a working ranch?” That is, it’s a ranch that is still operational, th at is still functioning as a ranch. Annie says, “I think so.  Why would they buy a ranc h if they don’t plan to have horses and livestock?”  “Horses,” you probably know , are large animals with four legs.  “Livestock” are animals that are raised – ar e born and grow up on a farm – usually for food or for something the animal produc es.  Livestock could be anything from cows, sheep, pigs, goats; these are a ll possible animals that we would call “livestock” (livestock – one word).  Pie ro is asking Annie if this is, in fact, a real ranch with horses and animals.  Annie says, “I think so.”  Why would they have a ranch without these things?

Piero says, “Don’t ask me.  What’s all that stuff i n your bags?”  In your luggage, the things you use to carry your clothes when you t ravel.  Annie says, “That’s all equipment I’ll need to ride a horse: a bridle, a bi t, and ta-da – my own saddle!”  A “bridle” (bridle) is something made of leather that  you put over the horse’s head, and it allows you to control the horse more easily.   There’s another word that is also pronounced “bridal” (bridal), which refers to a woman who’s getting married; we call that woman a “bride.”  So, “bridal” would b e the adjective referring to the things related to the bride.  You wouldn’t want to put a bridle on the bride, of

course, unless perhaps you’re the future husband!  Annie says that she has a bridle and a bit (bit).  A “bit” here is a metal ba r that goes in the horse’s mouth, and is used along with the bridle to control the ho rse.  “Bit” has many meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Gui de for some of those.  The expression “ta-da” (ta-da or ta-dah) is something w e use when we are introducing something surprising, but we’re doing i t in sort of a humorous way. It’s an expression that perhaps used to be used by magicians when they were about to do something surprising for the audience.  But now, we use it in a humorous, joking way to show something to someone t hat they might be surprised to see.  You want to show someone, for ex ample, your new pair of sunglasses.  So you turn around away from them, and  you put them on, and then you turn back around and you say, “Ta-da!  What do you think?”  And they say, “Oh!  They’re beautiful,” even if they’re not, beca use, of course, you don’t want to insult the person.  Right?  Well, Annie is surprisi ng Piero by saying and showing that she has a saddle (saddle).  A “saddle” is the thing that you use to put on top of the horse to sit on the horse so you don’t fall off.

Piero says, “This is all stuff that they should hav e at the ranch already, don’t you think?”  Annie says, “Yes, but I’ll need to go hors eback riding this weekend to practice.”  “Horseback (one word) riding” is when y ou ride a horse.  You get onto the horse’s back, literally, and you ride the horse ; you make it move and you go with it – usually.  I have never been horseback rid ing, and I really don’t want to go horseback riding!

Piero says, “That’s a good idea.  Have you been rid ing horses long (for a long time)?”  Annie says, “This weekend will be my first  time.”  Piero says, “You’re riding a horse for the first time this weekend and you plan to work at your sister’s ranch next month?”  Piero’s surprised since, of cou rse, Annie doesn’t have very much experience riding horses; she’s never done it before, and she wants to work on the ranch riding horses.  Annie says, “Sure , how hard could it be?”  This question is asked when we think something will not be very difficult.  She says, “It’s just like riding a bike, right?”  It’s simila r to riding a bicycle, which I don’t think it is.  But what do I know?  I’ve never ridden a ho rse.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
