<p>
Have you ever imagined how you can make a book by yourself? Let's
suppose you already have an hardcover of the right size. The next tasks
are printing the contents of the book onto sheets of paper (4 pages per
sheet, 2 per side), followed by folding the sheets in half, and then
stitching the sheets along the bisection to the cover. Simple, isn't
it? </p><p>
Not quite so! There are a couple of problems that must be solved. For
instance, there is a rather low limit to the number of sheets you can
stitch at a time (say, up to 32), and then there is the challenge of
printing the pages in the right order. If your book has hundreds pages
you will have to do multiple stitches, one for each section of sheets
of paper. A book signature is a section of sheets of printed paper
folded in half, ready to be stitched. </p><p>
Let's see an example: you want to make a mini-book with just 16 pages,
but the needle and thread you use only allow stitching 2 sheets of
paper at a time. In these conditions your book will have 2 signatures,
each containing (2 sheets of paper <span class="MATH">×</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 4 pages per sheet) = 8 pages per signature.
The following figure shows a top view of the folded sheets with numbers
indicating the book pages that you printed on each side. </tex2html_verbatim_mark></p><p>

To finish making the mini-book you place sheet 2 inside sheet 1 (of
signature 1) and stitch them both to the hard cover. The operation is
repeated for sheets 1 and 2 of signature 2. And there you have it: a
hand-made mini-book!

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>The input file contains several test cases. For each of them, the
input is a single line containing two integer numbers <b>n</b> and <b>m</b> separated by a
semi-colon. The first integer indicates the number of pages of the
book; the second integer is the size of the signature, measured in
sheets of paper. For example, <tt>16;2</tt> reflects the mini-book scenario described previously. ( 0<<b>n</b><=10000 , 0<<b>m</b><=32 ).
</p><p>

</p><p>
<br>

<b>Note:</b> if the number of pages of the book is not a multiple of (4 pages per sheet <span class="MATH">×</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> number of sheets per signature) you must add
empty pages at the end of the book. For instance, if the mini-book had
15 pages you would have to adjust the book size to 16.

<p>
<b>For each test case, the output must follow the description below. 
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

<br>The output contains instructions for printing the signatures. For
each signature you must indicate what pages will be printed on each
side of the each sheet of paper. See the sample output for the exact
output format; watch carefully that only lowercase letters are used as
well as the positions of spaces, colon, and semi-colon symbols.
