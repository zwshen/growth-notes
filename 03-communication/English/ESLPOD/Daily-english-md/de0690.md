This episode is called “Types of Views.”  “Views,” here, refers to what you can see out your window from a home or hotel room.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andrea:  Help me decide on which type of hotel room  to book.

George:  I want the one with a bed.

Andrea:  Very funny.  We have a choice of different  views, and each one is a different price.  For instance, a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.

George:  275 dollars a night?!  That’s highway robb ery!

Andrea:  If you think that’s too steep, there are a  few other options.  We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night  or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollars a night.

George:  I don’t really care which type of room we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor.  I don’t like havi ng people walking back and forth outside my window all night.

Andrea:  Okay, I can request a room on an upper flo or.  You really don’t have a preference?

George:  No, not really.

Andrea:  There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.

 George:  What?!  For that price, I’d better get a v iew of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!

The dialogue begins with Andrea saying to George, “ Help me decide on which type of hotel room to book.”  “To book,” as a verb,  means to reserve, to make arrangements to have something done at a particular  date or time in the future. For example: “I book a hotel room,” meaning I am re serving that room; I am saying that I am going to use that room on a certai n date.

George says, “I want the one with a bed.”  He’s say ing that he wants a hotel room that has a bed in it.  George, of course, is t rying to be funny.  Andrea then says, “Very funny,” which here means that’s not ver y funny, you are joking when I am trying to be serious.  She says, “We have a choi ce of different views, and each one is a different price.”  “For instance,” sh e says, meaning for example, “a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.”  A “city view” is a, in this case, hotel ro om that gives you a view of the buildings of the city.  If you ever go to New York City and you stay in Manhattan, the downtown area, you will have from any hotel roo m a city view.  That is, you will be able to see the lights of the city – of oth er buildings in the city.  A “panoramic view” is where you have the ability to s ee a very wide area, usually because you are high up in the building or you have  lots of windows around the room that allows you to see a much wider portion or  section of whatever it is you’re looking at.  That’s a “panoramic (panoramic)  view.”

George is surprised at the price; he says, “275 dol lars a night?!”  Notice “a night” here means per night or each night.  He says, “That ’s highway robbery!” “Robbery” is when someone steals something from you .  A “highway” is a road, usually one where you travel fast.  But the express ion “highway robbery” refers to previous times, where people traveled and it wasn’t  safe to travel; you might be robbed by someone as you were traveling down the ro ad.  That’s what George thinks the price of the hotel is; he says it’s “hig hway robbery,” meaning it is too expensive, it cost more than it should.

Andrea says, “If you think that’s too steep, there are a few other options.” “Steep” (steep) means very expensive here, at a ver y high price.  “Steep” has some other meanings as well; you can find those in the Learning Guide for this episode.  Andrea says, “We can get a courtyard room  with no view for 120 dollars a night.”  A “courtyard” (one word) is an o utdoor area that is completely surrounded by buildings.  Usually, a courtyard is s quare or rectangular.  There

are sometimes plant or trees inside the courtyard.  When you have a courtyard room, of course, you are looking just at other room s in the same building, so there really isn’t a view.  That’s why Andrea says,  “We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night.”  She says th ey could also get a room with obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollar s a night.  “Obstructed” (obstructed) is blocked, not able to be seen becaus e something else is in the way.  In some theaters or stadiums there are things  in front of your seat that block your view, that do not allow you to see what is on the other side.  That would be an “obstructed view.”  “Peek-a-boo” (peek- a-boo) is actually a child’s game, or a game that an adult plays with a very you ng child or baby.  “Peek-a- boo” is when you hide yourself so that the child ca n’t see you, and then suddenly you put your head in a position where the child can  see you, and then back again.  And, small children often find this amusing ; they think it’s fun.  A “peek-a- boo view” would be a view that you would have somet imes and sometimes not. It’s a partial view of something, similar to obstru cted but not obstructed all the time.  Perhaps there is a tree in front of the wind ow, and when the wind blows you can see through, so sometimes you can see.  This is a “peek-a-boo ocean view,” a view of the ocean or the sea, such as the Pacific or Atlantic.

George says, “I don’t really care which type of roo m we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor.”  “To end u p with” means to get a particular thing after waiting or making an effort.   It’s a very broad, general expression that can be used in many different insta nces.  For example if you are selling something at your store, at the end of the day after many hours someone may say to you, “Well, how much did you end up with  today?” meaning after working those many hours how much money did you hav e.  The expression here refers to what will happen after Andrea makes the r eservation, after they travel to the hotel, once they get to their room.  What did they end up with?  What did they finally or ultimately get?  What George does not wa nt to end up with is a room on the ground floor.  And, in the U.S. the “ground flo or” is the first floor, the floor that is the lowest in the building not including what is  below ground, the basement. George does not want a room on the ground floor.  H e says, “I don’t like having people walking back and forth outside my window all  night.”  “Back and forth” means going in two different directions repeatedly,  moving in one direction and then walking back in the other direction.  He’s say ing that he doesn’t want other people at the hotel walking by his window throughou t the night, as would be perhaps more common on the ground floor.  I’m not s ure if that’s true, but that’s what George thinks.

Andrea says, “Okay, I can request a room on an uppe r floor.”  “Upper,” here, would mean above the first floor, high up in the bu ilding.  “Upper” has a couple of different meanings; take a look, again, at our Learning Guide for some more

explanations.  She then says, “You really don’t hav e a preference?” meaning there isn’t one particular kind of room that you wa nt besides an upper room or upper-floor room.  George says, “No, not really.”  Andrea says, “There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.”  The “pent house,” especially in an expensive hotel or condominium building, is the hig hest floor, usually much bigger than the other rooms.  It is also, of course , the most expensive.

George says, “What?!  For that price (for 400 dolla rs), I’d better get a view of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!”  Once again, George is making a joke here.  He’s saying that if he has to pay 400 dollars a night, he should have a view of some of the great landmarks o r places in the world.  He should be able to see the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Parthenon in Athens, or the Great Wall of China.  Obviously, George doesn’t sta y in expensive hotels very often!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
