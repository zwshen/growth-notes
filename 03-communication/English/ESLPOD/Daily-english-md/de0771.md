This episode is a dialogue between Lisa and Omar ta lking about traveling on a train.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lisa:  Can you tell me if this is the right platfor m for the train to Arlington?

Omar:  Yes, it is.  Is this your first time taking the train?

Lisa:  Is it that obvious?

Omar:  No, you just look a little lost.

Lisa:  I’m starting a new job and I have to commute  to work for the first time.

Omar:  Oh, I see.  Did you buy a ticket at the tick et machine?

Lisa:  Yes, I did, when I entered the station.  I h ope I bought the right one.

Omar:  Let me see.  Yes, that’s the right one.  The  good news is that I haven’t heard any announcements about the train being delay ed, like it has been a couple of times this week, so it should be on time.

Lisa:  I’m relieved to hear that.  I can’t afford to be late to work on my first day. Will I need to show this ticket to get on the train ?

Omar:  Not when you get on.  After the train is und er way, the conductor will walk down the aisle to collect it.

Lisa:  Oh, I see, thanks.  That sounds simple.

Omar:  It is simple if you can actually find a seat .  It can be pretty crowded on these commuter trains.  Sometimes it’s standing roo m only.

Lisa:  Let’s hope for the best.

Omar:  Stick with me.  I’ll elbow a few people out of the way to get you a seat.

Lisa:  [laughs]  Thanks, I think.

Lisa begins by asking Omar, “Can you tell me if this is the right platform for the train to Arlington?”  A “platform” (platform) is a large, flat area where people stand waiting for a train or a subway train.  A tra in, you probably know, has several small sections called “cars,” but they’re n ot cars like you drive down the street.  They are cars that are connected to each o ther and all move in one direction down something called a “track” (track).

Well, Lisa wants to know if this is the right platf orm, the right place to get the train to Arlington.  Omar says, “Yes, it is.  Is this you r first time taking the train?”  Lisa says, “Is it that obvious?”  Something that is “obv ious” is something that is easily seen; you have no difficulty understanding it.  Wha t she’s saying here is do I really seem like that much of a beginner, obviously  it is the first time she has taken the train.  Omar says, “No, you just look a l ittle lost,” a little confused, like you don’t know where to go.

Lisa says, “I’m starting a new job and I have to co mmute to work for the first time.”  “To commute” (commute) means to travel usua lly from your home to where you work and back again.  Some people commute  by car, some people commute by subway; some people commute, if it’s a very long distance, by train. Lisa is commuting by train.

Omar says, “Oh, I see.  Did you buy a ticket at the  ticket machine?”  The “ticket machine” is the machine that gives you usually a li ttle piece of paper called a “ticket” that allows you to be on the train.  Lisa says, “Yes, I did, when I entered the station.”  The “station” is the area where the trains all come and stop, and that’s where you get on and off the train, at the t rain station.  You can also have a bus station.  Lisa says, “I hope I bought the right  one,” meaning I hope I purchased the correct ticket.

Omar says, “Let me see.  Yes, that’s the right one.   The good news is that I haven’t heard any announcements about the train bei ng delayed.  An “announcement” is information, in this case that wo uld be said over the large speakers in the train station on the platform.  If a train is going to be late they sometimes tell everyone – they announce it, and the  noun is an “announcement.” “To be delayed” means that it isn’t going to arrive  or leave when it’s supposed to; it’s late.  Sometimes trains are delayed; they don’ t arrive or leave when they are supposed to.  Omar says that the train has been del ayed a couple of times this week, but because there were no announcements it sh ould be on time.  When we say something is “on time” we mean it should lea ve at the correct or scheduled time, or arrive at the correct or schedul ed time.

Lisa says, “I’m relieved to hear that (I’m happy to  hear that).  I can’t afford to be late to work on my first day.”  “I can’t afford” me ans that it’s not possible for me, otherwise it will be very bad for me.  “Will I need  to show this ticket to get on the train?”  Omar says, “Not when you get on.  After the train is under way, the conductor will walk down the aisle to collect it.”  “After the train is under way” means after the train has already started to move –  has left the station.  Then, the “conductor,” the person who works for the train  company whose job it is to collect the tickets, he will walk – or she – will w alk down the aisle.  The “aisle” is the narrow area between the seats for walking, wher e you can move up and down the train.  The conductor will then “collect” the tickets, he will take them from you.  Sometimes he will put mark on them and then give them back to you, depending on the train.

Lisa says, “Oh, I see, thanks.  That sounds simple. ”  Omar says, “It is simple if you can actually find a seat.  It can be pretty (or  very) crowded on these commuter trains,” these trains that take people bac k and forth from work.  “To be crowded” means you don’t have a lot of room to move .  Omar says, “Sometimes it’s standing room only.”  “Standing room only” mea ns that all of the seats are filled.  There’s no place to sit down, you have to stand.  This, of course, is very common in a subway system in a large city, but some times it can happen on trains as well.

Lisa says, “Let’s hope for the best,” meaning let’s  be optimistic; let’s hope that we get a seat, in this case.  Omar says, “Stick with m e.”  “To stick with (someone)” means to stay very close to that person or to liste n to everything they say, especially when you are traveling somewhere or goin g somewhere.  Omar says, jokingly we think, “I’ll elbow a few people out of the way to get you a seat.”  “To elbow” (elbow), as a verb, means to push someone ou t of the way with your elbow.  Your “elbow” is the point in your arm that connects the forearm, that has your hand on the end of it, and I guess we’d call the upper part of your arm; that’s

the “elbow.  But as a verb “to elbow” would mean to  use that part of your body to push people away.  Omar is saying he’s going to elb ow a few people out of the way so that Lisa can have a seat.  We suspect here that Omar maybe is interested in Lisa, trying to be friendly with her.   Lisa laughs and says, “Thanks, I think.”  When someone says “I think” at the end, th at means they’re not really sure; they’re not sure if they should thank this pe rson for what they just said.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

I think it’s obvious we have the best scriptwriter on the Internet; that’s because we have the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
