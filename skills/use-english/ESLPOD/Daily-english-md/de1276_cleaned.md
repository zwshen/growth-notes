[start of dialogue] 

Francesca: Hey, don’t we have a meeting at 1:30? 

Jorge: We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kids are doing in the new on-site daycare. 

Francesca: I didn’t even know we had an on-site day care. 

Jorge: It’s something new the company is offering t o working parents. It’s a big perk and it’s great not having to drop off and pick  up my kids from a separate daycare every day. 

Francesca: That’s nice. 

Jorge: It’s really helped with the transition back to work from maternity and paternity leave. Finding the right childcare was tu rning out to be a big problem. 

Francesca: We really missed you when you were away.  

Jorge: Thanks. I’m also less distracted. I have pea ce of mind knowing the kids are here in the same building and I can check on th em anytime. It’s better for productivity. 

Francesca: That’s good. Now should we get started w ith our meeting? 

Jorge: Okay, but let’s keep it short. I want to che ck on the kids again in about 10 minutes.  

 Francesca: How many times have you checked on them already? 

Jorge: Four times. 

Francesca: Just today? 

Jorge: Just in the past hour.

Francesca begins our dialogue by asking Jorge, “Hey ” – which is just a way of getting Jorge’s attention – “don’t we have a meetin g at 1:30?” Jorge says, “We do. Sorry I’m late. I popped over to see how my kid s are doing in the new on-site daycare.” The phrasal verb “to pop (pop) over” mean s to go or visit someone quickly and unexpectedly, without an appointment. “ I’m going to pop over and see my mom on the way to work.” I’m going to go and  see her not for a long meeting probably, certainly not for anything formal , but more as an informal visit.  

We could also use the phrasal verb “to pop in” when  someone stops to talk to you with whom you didn’t have an appointment or who m simply you didn’t expect to see. We might use the two-word phrasal verb “pop ped in” – “He popped in to see me.” That means he came to see me for a short t ime and I probably wasn’t expecting him to see me or to visit me. 

Jorge says he popped over to see how his kids were doing in the new on-site daycare. “On-site” (on-site) is an adjective used t o describe something that is in the same place as something else. So for example, i f you work in a building that also has a coffee shop in it, or a place where you can buy coffee, we might say that you have a coffee shop “on-site” where you wor k.  

In this case, we’re talking about an “on-site dayca re” (daycare). The word “daycare” is used to describe a place that takes ca re of young children, usually children who are not old enough to go to school yet . In this case we’re talking about an “on-site daycare” – a place where parents can leave their children that is located in the same place where they work, or in  the same building. Jorge went to see his kids in the new on-site daycare. Frances ca says, “I didn’t even know we had an on-site daycare.”  

Jorge says, “It’s something new the company is offe ring to working parents.” “Working parents” just means a mother or a father w ho also works outside of the home. In the last few decades or so, when someone u ses the verb “to work,”  

they’ll often add the phrase “outside of the home” to indicate that the person has a job that requires them to go somewhere other than  their own house. The idea behind the expression really is to recognize that p eople who stay home with their children, mostly mothers, also are working. They’re  just not working outside of the home or working for extra pay.  

Jorge says this new on-site daycare is a “big perk”  (perk). A “perk” is a special benefit that you get, usually at your job, in addit ion to being paid. Your company, for example, might have a gym in the building that you can use after work or before work. That would be a “perk” – a special or additional benefit that you get besides getting paid. Jorge says, “It’s great not h aving to drop off and pick up my kids from a separate daycare every day.”  

The phrasal verb “to drop (drop) off” means to leav e a person or a thing at a particular place. Parents use this phrasal verb whe n talking about their children in situations where they are taking or transporting th eir child to one place and then later going back and getting the child from that sa me place. When they go back and get the child, we would use the phrasal verb “t o pick (pick) up.” “I’m going to drop off my child in the morning and pick him up an d take him back to my house in the afternoon.” 

These two phrasal verbs can also be used more gener ally to refer to taking someone from one place to another. “I’m going to dr op off my brother at the airport.” That means I’m going to leave him there a nd then he will go on his plane and go somewhere else. When my brother comes back o r when my brother arrives at the airport, I would then go and “pick h im up.” So when someone says, “Can you pick me up at the airport?” he means “Can you go to the airport and take me from the airport to another place?” If some one asks you “to drop him off at the airport,” he means that he wants you to take  him from a certain place, his hotel or your house, to the airport.  

Jorge thinks it’s great to be able to drop his chil d off at the daycare there where he works rather than having to drive somewhere else  and drop him off and then go to work. He continues by saying, “It’s really he lped with the transition back from maternity and paternity leave.” A “transition”  (transition) is a period of change from one situation to another. “Maternity” ( maternity) comes from the Latin word “mater,” meaning “mother.” “Maternity” r efers to something related to being a mother. “Paternity” (paternity) comes of co urse, for the Latin “pater” and that refers to something related to being a father.   

The word “leave” (leave) refers to time away from y our work, when you don’t have to work. You may be getting paid – that would be called “paid (paid) leave”  

– or it might be “unpaid leave.” You are away from your work for a week or a month or two months and you’re not being paid, but at the end of that time, you can come back to your job. A “leave” is when you ar e not working but you haven’t left your job. You still are able to come back to y our job when you are done with your leave.  

A “paternity leave” is time that a company or an or ganization would give a father right after a child has been born so that the fathe r could stay home and help take care of the child. More common is a “maternity leav e,” where a mother leaves her work for a certain amount of time after a child is born to take care of the child. Jorge is obviously talking here about “paternity le ave,” since he wasn’t the mother of the child. I’m pretty sure.  

He says, “Finding the right childcare was turning o ut to be a big problem.” “Childcare” (childcare) is when you arrange or you get someone else to take care of your child, either by having that person come to  your house or by taking your child to someone else’s place or house. Francesca s ays, “We really missed you when you were away.” Jorge says, “Thanks. I’m also less distracted.” “To be distracted” (distracted) means not focused, not abl e to think clearly about something because other things are bothering you.  

Jorge continues, “I have peace of mind knowing the kids are here in the same building and I can check on them anytime.” “Peace ( peace) of mind” means you are relaxed, calm. You don’t feel anxious or worrie d. Jorge says he’s not worried because he knows his kids are there in the same bui lding as he is, and he can “check (check) on them.” “To check on” someone mean s to quickly see how someone is doing, to take a short amount of time to  make sure someone is okay. You may call your daughter or son, if they go away to college, every day or every week to check on them, to make sure they’re okay. A nd they, of course, will call you when they need money. 

Jorge says that having the childcare there in the b uilding is better for “productivity” (productivity). “Productivity” refer s to the amount of work that a person or a group of people are able to complete in  a certain amount of time. Companies will often talk about the productivity of  their employees – how much the people that they pay to work for them get done in a certain amount of time. Francesca then says, “That’s good. Now should we ge t started with our meeting?”  

Jorge says, “Okay, but let’s keep it short.” The ex pression “to keep it short” means to do it quickly so it doesn’t last very long . He says, “I want to check on the kids again in about 10 minutes.” Francesca then  asks him, “How many times  

have you checked on them already?” Jorge says, “Fou r times.” Francesca then asks, “Just today?” And Jorge responds, “Just in th e past hour,” meaning in the last 60 minutes, he’s checked on his children four times. Perhaps the on-site daycare isn’t as good for productivity as Jorge thi nks it is, or at least his company might think that.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
