Our dialogue in this episode is a phone call between a person looking for some music and the clerk - or the person who works at the music store.  Let's take a listen!  > Clerk:  Hello.  Levin’s Music.  Ariel:  Hello.  I was wondering if you carry classical CD’s.  Clerk:  Yes, we have a pretty large selection.  What are you looking for?  Ariel:  I’m trying to find the latest Reunion Island Ensemble CD.  Clerk:  I’m not sure we have that in stock.  We have a lot of CD’s on back order.  Can I put you on hold while I check?  Ariel:  Sure.  Clerk:  Okay.  We have one copy of their 2005 CD left.  Is that the one you’re looking for?  Ariel:  Yes, it is.  How much is it?     Clerk:  Let me check the price.  It’s $17.95.    Ariel:  That’s great.  Could you hold that for me?
