Sharon: What do you have set up for the opening day ? There's normally a welcome dinner.

Leo: That's what I have arranged. Then, for the fol lowing day, I've lined up several speakers and panels to talk about produc tivity, teamwork, and the other topics we discussed.

In this podcast, we heard a conversation between Sh aron and Leo, talking about a company retreat. A “retreat” (retreat) in this si tuation means a meeting. It’s a meeting that companies have, usually somewhere away  from their office. These

are often meetings to do planning, thinking about the future, that sort of thing. In many American – big American companies, they have r etreats at a hotel somewhere, sometimes in a different city even, if it’s just for the executives, for the most important bosses. The word “retreat” as a noun and a verb, is also used in talking about a war – when you are in a battle w ith some other army and the army retreats – that means the army goes back. It p ulls back towards its own territory or its own country.

Well, in this dialog, Sharon asks Leo, how the plan s are “coming along” for the company retreat. That expression “to come along” me ans how are they developing, how are they turning out, how are they progressing – those are all ideas for this expression “to come along.” “To come  along” can also mean to “accompany,” to go with someone. But when someone s ays, “How are your plans coming along?” – they mean how are they developing?  Are they progressing – going forward – the way you want them to? Leo says that he’s made most of the “arrangements” and he thinks it’s going well. The “ arrangements” are all of the things that he has to do – making reservations, tal king to the hotel, talking to the airline – if they’re going somewhere else. So, thes e are all parts of “arrangements.” “Arrangements” (arrangements) is an ything that you have to do when you are planning a meeting, an event. You can make arrangements for a wedding, or make arrangements for a meeting.

Leo says that he’s “planning to send out informatio n” about the two-day event to managers at the end of this week. He’s “planning to ” means he’s intending to, he has the intention, he wants to send out information  about the two-day event. “Two-day” (two-day) is the same as the event of two  days. But we often use the hyphen form “two-day event,” “one-day event” – to d escribe something. Notice that we don’t say, “The two days event.” You might think that it should be plural, but in fact, it’s singular when there is a hyphen a nd it is used more or less as an adjective. So, “I’m going to a four-day retreat” me ans the retreat is going to be four days long.

Sharon asks Leo what he has “set up” for the openin g day. “To set up” (set up) is another one of those two-word verbs. It means to ar range. It means to plan. It can also mean sometimes to “put into place.” So, for example, we’ve set up the room for our meeting. We’ve moved the tables and pu t the chairs in the correct position – that could be set up. Here, when Sharon says, “What do you have setup for the opening day?” she means what do you h ave planned? What events – what will happen? The “opening day” is, of course , the first day of the retreat. We use that word “opening” to mean first – usually,  if it’s the first day of a long event. You also will hear that expression, for exam ple, for a sports season. “Opening day,” for baseball is the first day of the  official baseball season which

should be very soon I think. You can also have the opening day of school – it’s the first day.

Sharon says, “There’s normally a welcome dinner,” m eaning an opening dinner – a beginning dinner to welcome people to the event. Leo says that that is exactly what he has arranged. And “to arrange” (arrange) is  the verb of arrangements. So, we talked about arrangements. Well, this is the  verb form “to arrange.” Leo says that “For the next day” – for the following da y – the day after the opening day – he’s lined up several speakers and panels. “T o line up” (line up) – two words – means very much the same as to plan or to a rrange. “I’ve lined up some people.” We usually use that expression when we are  talking about arranging for people to talk to a group. I’ve lined up some good speakers. I’ve lined up some good presenters and so, we use that verb often when  talking about getting people to talk to a group. “Speakers,” of course, a re people who speak to a large group. And company retreats in the United States, o ften bring in what are called “motivational speakers,” or “inspirational speakers .” And these are speakers who are not necessarily experts on the company. They do n’t necessarily know a lot about the company, but they’re very good at talking  to people and getting them interested and excited about something. And they’ll  often be very good speakers – very interesting speakers to listen to.

Well, in addition to having speakers, Leo has also lined up some “panels.” A “panel” (panel) is when you have a group of people – usually sitting at a table, behind a table, in the front of a room and each per son has a microphone in front of them and you have a discussion among the people,  about a certain topic. So, you may have an expert from different areas come in  and each of them would be on a panel of four or five people and they will tal k about a topic like a discussion with each other so that people can listen to them.

Well, the speakers and panels that Leo has lined up  are going to talk about productivity and teamwork. “Productivity” is a very  common word you will read when companies talk about how they are doing – if they are making money. “Productivity” (productivity) is a noun and it mean s how hard the people in the company are working, how much they are producing. I f they spend 8 hours working, how much work do they get done – how much work do they finish – that’s “productivity.” The adjective would be “prod uctive.” If you say, “I am productive” that means “I’m getting something done, ” or “We had a productive meeting” means we got a lot accomplished. We manage d to do a lot at the meeting. That rarely happens, of course. Meetings a re usually not very productive. The opposite of productive is “unproduc tive” (un) – “unproductive.”

“Teamwork” – all one word – (teamwork) – “teamwork”  is the idea that people work together just like a team. And once again, Ame rican companies like to talk about teamwork – everyone working together. There’s  an expression “Be a team player.” “Be a team (team) player” means work toget her with other people, get along with other people, don’t argue with other peo ple – that’s being a team player.

Sharon asks about the “recreation” for the retreat.  “Recreation” means enjoyment – things that people can do – usually something phy sical like a sport. But it could be other things as well. “Recreation” is (recreatio n). There is a verb “to recreate” but it’s not used very often. The noun is much more  common. Sharon says that she doesn’t want the meeting to be “all work and no  play.” “All work and no play” means, of course, that they only work and they don’ t have time to play. But that’s sort of an expression. “I don’t want it to be all w ork and no play.” Leo says that the hotel where they’re “holding” the retreat – “to  hold” here means the same as to have. We often use it for meetings. “Where is the meeting being held?” “Where are we holding the meeting?” means where is it goin g to be.

Well, the hotel where they’re holding the retreat h as golf and water sports. “Golf,” of course, you all know – the sport that Tiger Wood s plays and other people. “Water sports” refers to skiing and swimming and do ing things, obviously, in the water. Sharon says, “It sounds good. It sounds like  you have it all under control.” “To have something under control” means that you are able to manage it, that nothing is being forgotten. “Everything is under co ntrol” – I have everything planned, everything has been taken care of – is ano ther way of saying that. Finally, Sharon says, “Keep up the good work.” That ’s a very common expression when you want to tell someone to continu e doing the good work that they are doing. “Keep up the good work.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
