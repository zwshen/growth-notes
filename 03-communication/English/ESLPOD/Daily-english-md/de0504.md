This episode is called “Training Inexperienced Employees.”  It’s a dialogue between Kazuko and Martin using a lot of vocabulary that  relates to experience or “inexperience” (someone without experience) at wor k.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kazuko:  I really appreciate you helping with the traini ng of the newbies.  I couldn’t have done it without you.

Martin:  Don’t mention it.  I remember when I was sti ll wet behind the ears and the veterans in the company gave me the benefit of thei r time and expertise. They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet.

Kazuko:  I can’t imagine you as a novice.  Everybody here th inks of you as the cornerstone of the institution.

Martin:  Well, that may be, but you should have seen m e in the early years.  I was naïve and reckless.  I may be more adept at my job now , but I felt inept for years.

Kazuko:  I saw you talking with some of the new recruits.  What advice did you give them?

Martin:  I gave them the same advice that an old hand g ave me when I first started: Take every piece of advice you get with a grain of salt!

 Kazuko begins by telling Martin that she really appreciat es him helping with the training of the newbies.  A “newbie” (newbie) is an i nformal term used to describe someone who’s a beginner, someone who’s a novice, someone who is new at something.  Kazuko says, “I couldn’t have done it without yo u.”  Martin says, “Don’t mention it,” meaning not at all, not a probl em.  “I remember when I was still wet behind the ears and the veterans in the compan y gave me the benefit of their time and expertise.”  The expression “to be wet b ehind the ears” means to be inexperienced, to be doing something for the first t ime, not to know exactly what you’re doing.  I’m not sure where the expression com es from, but it’s a common enough one.  When you say someone is “wet behind t he ears,” you mean they don’t know what they’re doing, they’re new a t something, they’re inexperienced.  A “veteran,” here, means someone who has a lot of experience, someone who has done something for a long time.  A vete ran teacher is someone who has been a teacher for long time.  The wor d “veteran” can also describe someone who was once part of a country’s army or mi litary forces, but here it just means someone with a lot of experience.

The veterans in the company gave Martin “the benefit of”  (the advantages of) their time and “expertise,” meaning their knowledge a bout something – their deep knowledge, their considerable understanding about someth ing.  He says, “They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet. ”  “To prop up (something)” or “to prop (something or someone) up” is a phrasal verb  meaning to support someone or something, to help someone do something – t o accomplish something.  So, in this case, because Martin didn’t have very much experience, he needed help; he needed other people to help him do what he needed to do, and they propped him up until he could stand on his ow n two feet.  “To stand on your own two feet” means to be independent, to do some thing without help from other people.

Kazuko says, “I can’t imagine you as a novice.”  A “novice” (n ovice) is a newbie, someone who is doing something for the first time, or s omeone who doesn’t have very much experience.  If you were beginning to learn the  piano, for example, you could say, “I’m a novice (I’m not very good, I’m a begi nner).”  Well, Kazuko says she can’t imagine Martin as a novice, “Everybody here thi nks of you as the cornerstone of the institution.”  The “cornerstone” is, i n this case, someone or something that is necessary for the success of a project or a company; something that is absolutely vital, important, something  you could not do without. The word “cornerstone” comes from architecture.  It’s the  actual piece of stone that you would put in the corner of a building, where  the two walls would meet. More generally, “cornerstone” is the part of the buildi ng that is often dedicated at the beginning of the construction of an important buil ding.  When used normally

 in conversation, it means the foundation, the thing tha t is very necessary or important.

Martin says, “Well, that may be (I may be thought of as t he cornerstone of this institution), but you should have seen me in my early year s.  I was naïve and reckless.”  “Naïve” (naïve) means that you don’t have a lot  of experience in life, so you have to trust other people.  Naïve is usually consid ered a bad thing; it’s when you trust other people too much and you believe thi ngs that you shouldn’t believe.  For example, if your new girlfriend tells you  that she’s going to have dinner with her ex-boyfriend because they’re just friend s, you might not want to be so naïve as to think that perhaps there isn’t something  else going on there. That would be an example of being naïve, perhaps.  the same would be especially so if it happened with your boyfriend.  If your  new boyfriend says they’re going to have dinner with their ex-girlfriend , you should probably maybe go with!  “To be reckless” means to things that are risky, without thinking about the danger involved.  We have an expression “reckless drivin g,” that’s when people drive their cars without any concern about how da ngerous driving can be, and, for example, they may hit another car or hurt peop le.  That is reckless driving, driving in a way that could cause an accident or d oes cause an accident.

Martin says, “I may be more adept at my job now, but I f elt inept for years.”  We have two words here that end in “ept”: “adept” (adept ) and “inept” (inept).  “To be adept” means to be able to do something easily, quickly, a nd well.  “My mother is adept at cooking (she can cook very well).”  That’s just an example, however! “Inept” means incapable, unable to do something, witho ut the ability to do something well.  “I am inept at playing the violin (I’ m not very good at it).”  Notice that both with “adept” and with “inept” we use the p reposition “at”: “I am adept at making cakes.”  The verb is in the “ing” after the “at.”  “I am inept at driving” – “ing” form.

Kazuko says, “I saw you talking with some of the new recrui ts.  What advice did you give them?”  A “recruit” is someone who has recently jo ined an organization. We usually talk about “recruits” as new employees, often p eople that we try to go and find and hire.  The army, the navy, the military fo rces also have recruits; these are people that they want to get to join the ar my and then join the military service.

Kazuko asks what advice Martin gave the new recruits.  Marti n says, “I gave them the same advice as an old hand gave me when I firs t started.”  The expression “an old hand” means a person who has a lot of experience doing something, someone who knows how to do something very wel l.  “Hand” has several different meanings in English; take a look at ou r Learning Guide for some

 additional explanations.  Martin says, “I gave them the s ame advice that an old hand gave me when I first started: Take every piece of a dvice you get with a grain of salt!”  “To take (something) with a grain of salt” is an old expression that means not to believe everything that you are told, to decide which things you are going to believe.  Of course, Martin is giving this as a piece of advice, that the recruits take advice from people like him with a grain of  salt.  Of course, if we take his advice about taking advice with a grain of salt, w ell, you see the problem – we’re not sure what to believe!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
