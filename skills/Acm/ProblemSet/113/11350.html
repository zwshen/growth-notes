<p>In number theory, the Stern-Brocot tree is a method of listing all
non-negative rational numbers as well as a point representing infinity
(here represented formally as 1/0). </p>

<p>The tree may be created by an iterative process. It is easiest to describe as a
list. Beginning with the list {0/1, 1/0} representing 0 and infinity respectively,
one places between any two fractions the mediant of the fractions (the mediant of
a/c and b/d is (a + b)/(c + d)). The first few steps of this process yield:<br>
<code>{0/1, 1/0}<br>
{0/1, 1/1, 1/0}<br>
{0/1, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1, 1/0}<br>
{0/1, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1/1, 3/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/0}</code></p>

<p>This process can be represented as a tree where each row corresponds to the
new numbers added at each step.</p>

<p>The position of a fraction in the tree can be specified as a path consisting of
L(left) an R(right) moves along the tree starting from the top (fraction 1/1).
Your have to find a fraction by a given path.</p>
	
<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
The first line contains integer N (0 &#60 N &#60= 10000), it is number of tests.
On next N lines there is a path in the tree. Path is the string if maximum
length of 90 characters consisting from characters 'L' or 'R'.</p>
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case print line formatted like this: "<code>a/b</code>". Where "<code>a</code>" is
numerator and "<code>b</code>" is denominator of the fraction.
	
<p><h4>SAMPLE INPUT:</b></h4>
<code><pre>
3
RL
RLR
RRL
</pre></code>
	
<p><h4>SAMPLE OUTPUT:</h4></p>
<code><pre>
3/2
5/3
5/2
</code></pre>
