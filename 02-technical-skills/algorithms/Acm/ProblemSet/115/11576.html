<h2>Problem E: Scrolling Sign</h2>

Electric scrolling signs are often used for advertising.
A given sign displays exactly <i>k</i> characters. When the
sign is switched on, all of the character positions are
initially empty (showing spaces). In each time interval,
all of the characters on the sign are shifted to the left
by one position, and a new character is added at the right-most
position. The character that was in the left-most position
moves off the sign.
<p>
For certain sequences of words, it is possible to reuse characters
from one word to form a subsequent word. For example, on a sign
with three character positions, the sign can display the message
CAT ATE TED by scrolling in the five characters CATED.
<p>
The advertiser has a specific message to show using the sign.
The faster the message is displayed, the more people will be
able to see the whole message. Therefore, your job is to find
a way to display all the words of the message by scrolling in
the smallest number of letters. In between showing the words
of the message, the sign may display other words that are not
considered part of the message. However, the words of the message 
must be shown in the order in which they are given. If a word
appears two or more times consecutively in the message, the
sign only needs to show it once.
<h3>Input Specification</h3>

The first line of input contains a single integer <i>n</i>, the number
of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line
containing a two integers, <i>k</i>, the number of character positions on
the sign, and <i>w</i>, the number of words in the message.
Each of the two integers is between 1 and 100, inclusive.
The following <i>w</i> lines each contain a word of the message comprising
exactly <i>k</i> uppercase letters.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
2
3 2
CAT
TED
3 3
CAT
ATE
TEA
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>

For each test case, output a line containing a single integer, the
minimum number of letters that must be scrolled into the sign
so that it displays all the words of the message.
