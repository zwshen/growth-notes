This episode is called “Talking About Wealth.”  “Wealth”  is having a lot of money. It’s a dialogue between Anton and Vanessa, where we’re  going to hear a lot of vocabulary that is used when talking about people who hav e a lot of money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anton:  Look at that guy.  He’s been in town two weeks a nd he’s already throwing his money around.

Vanessa:  You know as well as I do that money talks.  He’s j ust trying to make a splash in the business community.

Anton:  If that were all he was doing then I wouldn’ t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind.  Who does he think he i s?

Vanessa:  He’s someone who’s used to getting his way, that’ s obvious.  He’s not the first affluent person to try to buy influence and so cial standing in a community.

Anton:  Yeah, but look at all of the people in this t own throwing themselves at him!

Vanessa:  He has donated generously to the town and given  to the arts.  He’s even given money toward building the new community center , and it wasn’t chump change either.  If he wants to be a patron in th is town, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?

 Anton:  Right, so spreading money around gives him the right to walk around like he owns this town?

Vanessa:  Is this a case of sour grapes?

Anton:  Ha, right!  Haven’t you heard?  Money is the r oot of all evil!

Anton begins the conversation by saying, “Look at that guy.  He’s been in town two weeks and he’s already throwing his money around.”  H e’s been in town – he’s been in this city for only two weeks and he’s already t hrowing his money around.  “To throw your money around” means to spend a  lot of money so that everyone knows that you have a lot of money; you’re letti ng everyone know that you are rich.

Vanessa says, “You know as well as I do that money talks.”  T his expression, “money talks,” means that people who have a lot of money get attention; they’re able to influence things, they have power.  Vanessa says, “H e’s just trying to make a splash in the business community.”  “To make a splash ” means to do something that other people will notice, to do somethi ng that other people will see.  “Splash” has a couple of meanings in English; take a  look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Anton says, “If that were all he was doing then I would n’t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind.  Who does he think he i s?”  To be a “social climber” means to be a person who tries to get power o r influence in society or an organization by getting or being in relationships,  friendships with people.  A social climber is someone who wants to be important, and so decides on making friends so that he or she can have more power.  It’s usual ly considered a negative description to call someone a social climber.  An ton thinks that this guy is a social climber; “Who does he think he is?” he says.  This is a question that we might use to say this person thinks that they are more important than they really are.

Vanessa says, “He’s someone who’s used to getting his way, t hat’s obvious.” “To get your way” means to have things happen the way tha t you want them to happen, to be able to control things.  “He always gets his way,” people always do what he wants them to do.  Vanessa says, “He’s not the fi rst affluent person to try to buy influence and social standing in a community.”  He’ s the – rather, he’s not the first affluent person; “affluent” is another word for rich, wealthy, someone with a lot of money.  Not me, for example!  “He’s not the f irst affluent person to try to

 buy influence.”  “To buy influence” is to use your money so  that you are more powerful, you are more important.  He’s trying to buy i nfluence and social standing.  “Social standing” is your importance in a comm unity, in an organization, in society.  We might also say your “social st atus,” the way people look at you and treat you in a group or community.

Anton says, “Yeah, but look at all of the people in this town throwing themselves at him!”  “To throw yourself at (someone)” means to do  something, to do whatever is necessary to get someone’s attention or to be l iked by another person.  A woman, for example, who’s very interested in a  handsome man – a good looking man – might throw herself at him, might try to do anything to get him to pay attention to her or to like her.  This has n ever happened to me!

Vanessa says, “He has donated generously to the town and gi ven to the arts.” “To donate” means to give money to usually an organizat ion that needs it.  The Red Cross, for example, receives donations.  This person ha s “donated generously,” meaning he’s given a lot of money to the to wn – to the community and to the arts.  “The arts” refers to theater, or mu sic groups, or artistic groups; all of these would be considered part of the arts: ope ra, dance, and so forth. Vanessa says, “He’s even given money toward building the new  community center, and it wasn’t chump change either.”  A “communit y center” would be a building that people in your neighborhood or communi ty or a small town would use for various purposes: meetings for example, performan ces perhaps.  This is a case where someone has given money toward building a ne w community center, and Vanessa says it wasn’t “chump change.”  This is an  informal expression meaning a small amount of money, an amount of money that is so small it’s not important.  That’s chump change, “chump” ( chump).

This man has not given chump change, meaning it wasn’t a small amount; it was a lot of money.  Vanessa says, “If he wants to be a patron  in this town, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?”  A “patron” is a person who supports, usually with their money, an organization.  Usually it’ s a non-profit organization or an artistic organization.  That’s a patron.  The expressio n “to look a gift horse in the mouth” means to not be thankful for a gift, and i nstead wonder why that person is giving you this gift.  It can also mean that you shouldn’t try to look too closely at the gift with an attempt to find if you can g et more out of it, try to get something more from the person who gave it to you.  Th ose are both possible meanings of this expression.  Here, I think it just means that we should not be ungrateful; we should be thankful for this gift and no t look at it too closely, we should be just happy that we have it.

 Anton says, “Right, so spreading money around gives him the  right to walk around like he owns this town?”  “To spread money around ” means to spend a lot of money in many different places or with many differen t people and organizations.  Anton says that because he is spending so mu ch money he thinks he can walk around this town – this community as if h e owns it, that is to say like he were the owner of the town.

Vanessa says, “Is this a case of sour grapes?”  “Sour grapes”  is the feeling of wanting something that you don’t have, perhaps because yo u lost a competition or because you don’t have as much money or talent as ano ther person. Sometimes people pretend that whatever the other perso n has is not important or is bad.  It’s really a kind of jealousy, to want what some one else has and to be angry or mad that the other person has it.

Anton says, “Ha, right!”  Oddly enough, this expression re ally means you’re wrong, I don’t agree with you.  Sometimes when peopl e say “right,” they really are trying to say I don’t agree with you, it depends on how they say it.  In this case, Anton is trying to use expression to show disagreement.   “Ha, right! Haven’t you heard?  Money is the root of all evil!”  The  “root” of something is the cause got something, in this case.  “Money is the root of  all evil” is an expression that means that money causes problems.  The expression origi nally comes from the Bible, and it is not “Money is the root of all evil ,” it’s “Love of money is the root of all evil.”  It’s not the money that’s bad, it’s loving  your money too much that can be bad.  But now the expression has changed, really, int o this notion that money itself is the root of evil.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
