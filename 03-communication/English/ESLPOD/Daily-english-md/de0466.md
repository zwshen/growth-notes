This episode is about bedside manner.  It’s going to be a conversation about doctors, and it will use a lot of vocabulary that doctors might use when you go to visit them.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cho:  I’m not sure I’m cut out to be a doctor.

Joy:  I think you’ll be great.  I’ve seen you with patient s and you have a great bedside manner – not like Gregory.

Cho:  Why?  What’s wrong with his bedside manner?

Joy:  I’ve seen him with patients and he can be really cal lous.  For instance, I was in the room last week when he was telling one of hi s patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.

Cho:  What did he say?

Joy:  He just blurted it out.  He told her the diagnosi s, and he didn’t even try to soften the news when she asked about her prognosis.  He di d absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassure her.

Cho:  I feel sorry for the patient.

Joy:  That’s the point.  Gregory didn’t, and it didn’t  seem to faze him that the patient was very upset and close to hysterics.

 Cho:  That’s terrible.  I’ll try to remember to be m ore compassionate with my patients.

Joy:  Don’t worry.  It’s against your nature to be anythin g but considerate.

Our dialogue begins with Cho saying to Joy, “I’m not sur e I’m cut out to be a doctor.”  To be “cut out” means to be created to do som ething, something that is a good match for you, something that is intended for yo u.  Someone might say, if you like to write and to ask people questions, you may be cu t out to be a journalist (a reporter – someone who works at a newspape r).  More often you’ll hear this expression in the negative: “He’s not cut out for that kind of work” – he is not made for that kind of work, he doesn’t have the talent for that kind of work.

Cho is a doctor, and says that he’s not cut out to be a do ctor.  Joy says, “I think you’ll be great.  I’ve seen you with patients and you ha ve great bedside manner.” “Patients” are people who are receiving medical care or  attention from a doctor or a nurse.  If you’re sick, you go in to see a doctor, you are  a patient.  “Bedside manner” refers to the way that a doctor or a nurse talks to people, how they give medical advice or instructions or other information.  It’ s a general term to refer to how doctors treat their patients – how they communicate  with their patients, because that’s such an important part of medicine.

Joy says that Cho has great bedside manner – not like Grego ry.  Cho says, “Why?  What’s wrong with his bedside manner?”  Joy says, “I ’ve seen him with patients and he can be really callous.”  “Callous” (callou s) means without considering another person’s feelings, somewhat mean, not  being considerate of someone else, not thinking about the feelings of someone  else.  “Callous,” like the expression “cut out,” has a couple of different meani ngs in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.  Joy says, “For instance (for example), I was in the room last week when he was telling one of his patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.”  The expression “to take a turn for the worse” means to be getting worse, to worse n; it’s the opposite of “getting better,” especially when you are talking about someone’s health.  If you say, “She’s taken a turn for the worse,” you mean she has b ecome sicker, she has become more ill.

Cho says, “What did he say?” meaning what did he say to t his patient about taking a turn for the worse.  Joy says, “He just blurted i t out.”  To “blurt (blurt) something out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say something  without thinking

 about it first, without thinking about how it will so und to the other person or how that other person may react; it can be a good thing or a bad thing.  In this case, it clearly was a bad thing because this other doctor, Gregor y, told his patient the diagnosis and didn’t even try to soften the news when she  asked about her prognosis.  A “diagnosis” is the doctor’s conclusion about wh at the medical problem is; it’s the doctor’s idea about what the probl em with your health is.  “To soften (something)” here means to make it nicer, to make it easier to accept.  So “to soften the news” means to tell someone something in such a way that it doesn’t upset them.  We have an expression: “to soften t he blow” (blow).  “Blow” here means a punch or a hit.  So if someone is going to  give you bad news, they will try to soften the blow – to soften the news.  Wome n sometimes do this to men who ask them out on a date.  They’ll say, “Oh, I’m busy on Friday,” and the man says, “What about Saturday?”  “Oh, I’m busy on Saturd ay, too.”  If the man is intelligent, he’ll understand that she’s trying to sof ten the blow, instead of just saying, “No, you’re ugly!” for example.  A “prognosis” (p rognosis) is the doctor’s opinion about how your health will change in the futu re.  So, “diagnosis” is what the doctor thinks is what is wrong with you; “prognosis” is what the doctor thinks the future will be for you.  If you have a good progno sis, that means you will be healthy, or least live for a long time.

This doctor, however, did not try to soften the news abo ut her prognosis; Joy says, “He did absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassu re her.”  “To comfort” someone means to do or say something that will make the person feel better, make the person feel more comfortable.  “To reassure” so meone means to make them feel better about something; it’s similar to “comf ort,” make them feel less worried about something or more confident about somet hing.  We have an expression: “Let me reassure you, there is nothing wrong w ith the American banking system.”  The idea is that we are giving you confid ence that everything is okay.

Cho says to Joy, “I feel sorry for the patient.”  “To feel  sorry for (someone)” is to understand the person’s difficulty, to empathize with so meone.  Joy says, “That’s the point.  Gregory didn’t (meaning Gregory didn’t fe el sorry for his patient), and it didn’t seem to faze him that the patient was very upset  and close to hysterics.” The expression “didn’t seem to faze (faze) (someone)” is a phrase that means that you are surprised because someone else wasn’t affected  by something or didn’t have a strong reaction to something.  So, going  back to our previous example: the man asks a woman out on a date, the woman says, “No, you’re ugly,” because she doesn’t try to soften the blow, you see – doesn’t try to comfort him, and the man is not fazed by her answer, he just tu rns to another woman and asks her out instead.  He is not affected; he does not have  a reaction to something that he should have a reaction to.

 Now, Gregory was not fazed by what happened, even though  the woman was close to hysterics.  “Hysterics” (hysterics) is when you have uncont rolled emotions, when you can’t stop crying because the emotion i s so strong in you. Cho says, “That’s terrible.  I’ll try to remember to be more compassionate with my patients.”  “To be compassionate” means to be caring, to be kind, to be nice to someone.  Joy says, “Don’t worry.  It’s against your nature t o be anything but considerate.”  The expression “to be against your natur e” means it’s something that you can’t do because it’s not part of your personali ty; it’s not part of your character, it’s not part of who you are.  “Anything but”  is a phrase we use to emphasize the next word by saying it is definitely not tru e.  For example: “The movie was anything but boring.  It was, in fact, very excit ing.”  In this case, Joy is saying that Cho is anything but considerate.  “To be consi derate” means to be nice, to be aware of other people’s feelings.  Joy is sayi ng that it is against Cho’s nature, it is impossible for Cho to be anything but consi derate; he is not going to be mean to his patients.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

It is against the nature of our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy T se, to be anything but brilliant in her scripts.  Thank you, Lucy.
