This episode is a dialogue between a mother and a f ather who are trying to get a picture taken of the entire family. Let’s get start ed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places. 

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer ju st take the photo? 

Dad: We have to pose. The whole point is to look na tural. 

Mom: If you wanted a natural family photo, why are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting? 

Dad: I want us to stand in front of a nice backgrou nd and pose with nice props. I’m tired of looking at the photos that we take. Th ey’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative cropping. 

Mom: Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearin g color-coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses. 

Dad: Don’t be like that. Generations to come will c herish this family photo. 

Mom: I doubt it. 

Dad: How about if I ask the photographer to take so me shots just of you?  

Mom: You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars ge t?  

Dad: Uh, sure, if that’s what you’d want. 

Mom: Well, in that case, I’ll need to have my hair cut, get my makeup done, and buy a new outfit . . . 

Dad: What have I gotten myself into?!

The title of this episode is “Having a Family Portr ait (portrait) Taken.” A “portrait,” in this dialogue, refers to a photograph. Usually w hen we talk about having a portrait taken, we’re talking about having a photog raph in usually some sort of formal setting, or when you are wearing very nice c lothes. It’s a photograph that might be used for putting on your wall, or even in some cases for giving to other people as a gift. In the old days, before cameras, people had portraits painted of them, but most people don’t have painted portraits.  They have portraits that are photographs.  

Dad begins by saying, “Okay, everybody, take your p laces.” “To take your place” means to sit or stand where you’re supposed to for some sort of performance or show, or in this case, for taking a photograph. Dad  is telling everyone to take their places – to go where they’re supposed to go. The mother says, “We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer just take the ph oto?” The “photographer” is the person whose job it is to take photographs.  

Dad says, “We have to pose.” “To pose” (pose) is to  hold your body in a particular position, especially so that you can be photographed or painted. You put your body in a certain position and someone pai nts you in that position, or in this case, takes a photograph of you. Dad says, “Th e whole point is to look natural.” “The whole point” means the main purpose of something, the reason you are doing something.  

Of course, this is a little funny because if you ar e posing, you’re really not doing something naturally. To do something natural would be not to pose, not to put your body in a particular fixed position in order t o have a photograph taken of it. Mom says, “If you wanted a natural family photo, wh y are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting?” Mom has a good point h ere. She’s telling Dad that they don’t need to go to a portrait studio in order  to get a natural look to their photograph.  

A “portrait studio” would be a place you go to get your photograph taken for some formal event, usually. Only professional photograph ers typically have portrait  

studios – places where people can go and get their picture taken. Portrait studios often have special lighting and backgrounds that ar e used as part of the process of taking the portrait. A “sitting” (sitting) is a period of time when you sit in front of a camera or an artist in order to have your paintin g made or your photograph taken.  

Dad says, “I want us to stand in front of a nice ba ckground and pose with nice props.” A “background” is what is seen behind you. And as I just mentioned, portrait studios or photo studios often have specia l backgrounds special pieces of paper or material that look like mountains or field s or something that you stand in front of in order to have your photograph taken. Da d wants a nice background with nice “props” (props).  

A “prop” is an object that is usually used for a pe rformance such as a play, but it could also be used in a photo session – that is, wh en you are taking photographs of someone, such as in this case. A prop is any phy sical object that would be used as part of a performance or in what we might c all a “photo shoot” (shoot), which is a session or a period of time when many ph otographs are taken of a person.  

Dad says, “I am tired of looking at the photos that  we take. They’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative croppi ng.” “To touch up” a photograph is to improve it by making small changes  to it. Nowadays, of course, with programs such as Photoshop, people are able to  change photographs, often making them look nothing like the original photogra ph – the actual thing that was photographed, or person. “Cropping” (cropping) refe rs to cutting the top, bottom, or sides of a digital photograph so that you elimin ate certain things that were in the original photo.  

Mom says, “Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearing color-coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses.” Mom is so rt of making fun of Dad here. She’s saying that they don’t look very natural if t hey’re wearing color-coordinated clothing. “Color-coordinated” means that the clothe s, the colors of the clothes, somehow match – that they look good together. Mom, of course, is saying that this isn’t very natural looking. Dad says to Mom, “ Don’t be like that.” “Don’t be like that” is what you say to someone who you think is m aking fun or is behaving in a way that you don’t like.  

Dad says, “Generations to come will cherish this fa mily photo.” The expression “generations (generations) to come” refers to peopl e in your family who are younger than you, or who will be born in the future  – “future generations,” we might also say. “To cherish” (cherish) means to adm ire something and to value it,  

to think it’s very important, to think it is worthy . What Dad is saying is that in the future, his children and their children and their c hildren will cherish this photo. They will think it very valuable.  

Mom says, however, “I doubt it.” She doesn’t think so. Dad says, “How about if I ask the photographer to take some shots just of you ,” meaning a photograph just of the mom. Mom says, “You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars get?” A “headshot” (headshot) is a photograph of just your neck and your head. It doesn’t include the rest of your body. This is very popular  here in Los Angeles, here in Hollywood, where actors and actresses try to get jo bs in the television industry or the movie industry or in modeling, and they have a photograph made of themselves.  

We call that photograph of their head their “headsh ot.” I personally don’t have a headshot. The funny thing is when you go to restaur ants here in Los Angeles, you can look up on the wall and most of them, even restaurants that aren’t very good quality, will have headshots on the wall of ac tors and actresses who’ve eaten there. Usually the photograph, the headshot, is signed by that person. Sometimes they’re famous people, sometimes they’re people that you’ve never heard of before. Anyway, Mom is asking if she can h ave a headshot made of herself.  

Dad says, “Uh, sure if that’s what you want.” Mom t hen says, “Well in that case” – in this situation, then – “I’ll need to have my h air cut, get my makeup done, and buy a new outfit.” “To have your makeup done” means  to have someone do it on you professionally – to have your makeup done in su ch a way that it looks perfect or makes you look perfect. A “new outfit” would be a new set of clothing. Dad is now regretting offering Mom a headshot photograph. He says, “What have I gotten myself into?” meaning “What trouble or diffi culty have I created now for myself by saying that?”  

Now, when I was younger we, a couple of times, had a family portrait taken of my family – my brothers and sisters and my parents. No w remember, I come from a very large family. I have ten brothers and sisters,  so there were 13 people in the family portrait. The portrait was taken as part of a little book that was published by the church that I went to as a child. The church  would bring in a professional photographer and families could come and have their  family portrait taken to be used as part of this little book.  

Well, the family portrait that I remember was when I was about five or six years old, when we all got up in front of the camera to h ave the photograph taken. The  

photographer said, “Oh no, just one family at a tim e,” and my father said, “Well, this is just one family.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places. 

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer ju st take the photo?
