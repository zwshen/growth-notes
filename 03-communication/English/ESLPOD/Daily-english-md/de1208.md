This episode is a dialogue between Dylan and Yvonne  about living with not very much money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dylan: Here.

Yvonne: What’s this?

Dylan: It’s information about a job-training progra m. It’ll give you the skills you need to get steady work.

Yvonne: I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.

Dylan: You’re in a dead-end job straining to make e nds meet every month.

Yvonne: I’ve always landed on my feet.

Dylan: But you don’t have any job security. You cou ld be out on your ear any minute. Don’t you want a better quality of life?

Yvonne: My life is fine the way it is. I may not be  able to hold on to this job for long, but there will always be other ones.

Dylan: I wish I had your optimism. To hear you spea k, you’d think you were one of the privileged few.

Yvonne: It’s all in your outlook on life. I don’t h ave mortgages to pay, cars to maintain, jets to fuel, and employees to support.

 Dylan: You’re right. You should be counting your bl essings!

Dylan begins our dialogue by giving something to Yv onne. He says, “Here.” This is sometimes a word we would use by itself when we are giving some object to another person. We are “handing” it, we might say, to another person. Yvonne takes what he is giving her and says, “What’s this?

Dylan says, “It’s information about a job-training program” – a program that will teach you skills to get a job. Dylan says, “It’ll g ive you the skills you need to get steady work.” “Steady (steady) work” is work that y ou can rely on, that you will be able to count on. For example, if you have a job wi th a company and the company always gives you 40 hours of work each week , you have “steady work.” You have work that you can rely on.

The opposite of “steady work” would be “seasonal wo rk,” or perhaps “temporary work.” Here in Los Angeles, if you are an actor, yo u often don’t have steady work. You may work for a month and then not have an y work for a couple of months and then work for a few weeks, and so forth.  If, however, you work on a television program that you know will be on for man y years, then you could say you have steady work. Steady work is something that  most of us have if we have a permanent job with a company.

Yvonne says, “I don’t need that. I get by with the wages I earn from this job.” “To get by” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning “I have enough money or resources to pay for what I need to pay for.” “To get by” mea ns you are able to pay for your food, and your rent, and your clothing, and your ce ll phone bill, and so forth. It doesn’t mean you’re getting rich, however. Yvonne s ays she gets by with the “wages” (wages) that she “earns” – that she gets – from her job.

“Wages” refer to money that you get for your work, especially when you are paid by the hour – that is, your company gives you 10 do llars for every hour you work, or 50 dollars for every hour you work. Many people have what are called “salaries” (salaries). A “salary” is when you are p aid a certain amount of money regardless of how many hours you work. You might wo rk 40 hours. You might work 60 hours. You get the same amount of money. Wi th wages, you are paid by the hour, typically. If you work more hours, you ge t more money.

Dylan says to Yvonne, “You are in a dead-end job st raining to make ends meet each month.” A “dead-end job” is a job that doesn’t  have any opportunities for

promotion or advancement. In other words, you’re ne ver going to get a better job in that company or doing what you’re doing. You’re always going to be doing the same thing. The verb “to strain” (strain) here mean s to try very hard to have something or to do something – to work very hard in  order to get something.

Dylan says Yvonne is “in a dead-end job straining t o make ends meet.” “To make ends (ends) meet (meet)” means to make enough money  to pay for your expenses. It’s similar to the phrasal verb “to get by.” So Dylan is saying that Yvonne is in this dead-end job and she is trying re ally hard, or having to work really hard, just to have enough money to live on. She is “straining to make ends meet.”

Yvonne says, however, “I’ve always landed on my fee t.” “To land (land) on your feet” is an expression that means even in a difficu lt situation, I always have success, or perhaps, I’m always lucky. If someone l oses his job but has a lot of skills or perhaps knows a lot of people, we could s ay that he will land on his feet. He won’t land on his head and kill himself or hurt himself, metaphorically. He will land on his feet. He will be able to stumble or fal l but get up again and be successful.

If you jump off a building and land on your feet, y ou’ll be able to continue living and walking and breathing, but if you land on your head, you might kill yourself. So, you definitely want to land on your feet. Yvonn e says she always lands on her feet even when she has difficult circumstances to deal with. Dylan says, “But you don’t have any job security” (security). “Job s ecurity” is confidence that you will have your job in the future, that you are not going to lose your job.

Dylan says, “You could be out on your ear any minut e.” The expression “to be out on your ear” (ear) means to lose your job, to b e fired. You can imagine, I suppose, someone throwing you out of the building a nd throwing you down to the ground – that would be literally “landing on your e ar.” Dylan says basically that Yvonne could be fired any minute. She doesn’t have very good job security. He says, “Don’t you want a better quality of life?” Th at is, “Don’t you want to be happier in your everyday life, in your everyday exi stence?”

Yvonne says, “My life is fine the way it is.” That means “My life is okay the way I am living it now.” “I may not be able to hold on to  this job for long,” she says, “but there will always be other ones,” meaning other job s. “To hold on to” something means to be able to keep something, to continue to have something even when it is difficult. “I’m trying to hold on to this job ev en though the boss doesn’t like me and I’m not very good at the job.” That’s my case h ere at the Center for

Educational Development. My boss is always trying t o fire me and I am trying to hold on to my job.

Dylan says, “I wish I had your optimism.” “Optimism ” (optimism) is the belief that things will be better in the future or that things will continue to be successful. The opposite of “optimism” is “pessimism” (pessimism). “Pessimism” is when you think everything is going to get worse. “Optimism” is when you think things will be good in the future or will continue to be good in t he future.

Dylan says, “To hear you speak, you’d think you wer e one of the privileged few.” What Dylan means here is if anyone would listen to you, they would think that you were one of the “privileged (privileged) few.” The “privileged few” refers to the small percentage of people who have a lot of mo ney or are very successful. In the United States, more recently, we’ve had the expression “the 1 percent,” meaning the very richest 1 percent in the country. They would be among the “privileged few.”

Yvonne says, “It’s all in your outlook on life.” Yo ur “outlook” (outlook) is the way you look at the world, the way you see things in ge neral – your perspective. It’s also, of course, the name of the email program in M icrosoft Office. But that’s different. “I don’t have mortgages to pay, cars to maintain, jets to fuel, and employees to support.” Yvonne is saying that she do esn’t have any burdens. She doesn’t have anything she needs to take care of in her life such as “mortgages” (mortgages). “Mortgages” are loans that you have to  either buy a house or to buy a car.

Yvonne says she doesn’t have any mortgages or loans . She doesn’t have any “cars to maintain” – that is, to keep in good runni ng order. She doesn’t have any “jets” (jets) to fuel. A “jet” is a fast airplane. Here it probably refers to a small airplane owned by a rich person. Yvonne says she do esn’t have to worry about fueling, or putting gasoline into, her own jet. Dyl an says, “You’re right,” meaning you are correct. “You should be counting your bless ings.”

“To count (count) your blessings” is an expression that means to recognize the good things in your life – to appreciate and be tha nkful for the good things you have in your life. It could be used by someone who has problems and is telling another person that he should be thankful for not h aving the problems that the person speaking has. It might also be used simply t o tell someone who is unhappy or complaining about his life that he shoul d be happier because he has good things. He should count his blessings.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
