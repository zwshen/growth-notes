[start of dialogue]

Jason: Hey, that guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?

Ida: Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it.

Jason: What’s going on here? Why did you just let t hat guy take things without paying?

Ida: If you must know, I’m paying for protection.

Jason: Protection? From whom?

Ida: Those guys. They rule this neighborhood. If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.

Jason: You mean this is a shakedown? They’re threat ening you with violence unless you pay?

Ida: Yes, but what else can I do? All of the busine sses on this street pay, one way or another.

Jason: But a protection racket is extortion. It’s a gainst the law. You could tell the police.

Ida: The last person who squealed had his store tor ched. I’m not going up against these guys. Things could get ugly, really u gly. Are you leaving?

Jason: Yeah, I’m going to try to find that that guy  who was here and talk to him, tell him to lay off you.

Ida: You can’t do that! Those guys mean business. T hey’ll hurt you.

Jason: Not a chance. When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure.

Ida: Stop! I’m not letting you stick your neck out for me. Your funeral won’t be on my head!

[end of dialogue]

Jason begins our dialogue by saying to Ida, “Hey, t hat guy just took merchandise without paying. Didn’t you see him?” Jason says, “H ey” (hey), a way of getting Ida’s attention, getting her to listen to him. “Tha t guy,” meaning that man, “took merchandise” (merchandise). “Merchandise” refers to  things that you sell. We might also call them “goods” (goods). They are thin gs, physical things, usually, that you sell, such as plates and cups and computer s and chairs and microphones and, well, anything that you can sell.

Ida says, “Yeah, but it’s okay. Forget about it,” m eaning “Don’t worry about it.” Jason is confused. He says, “What’s going on here?”  meaning “What is happening here?” “Why did you just let that guy tak e things without paying?” Ida says, “If you must know,” meaning if it is necessar y that I tell you, “I’m paying for protection.” “Protection” (protection) is normally something you do to prevent you from getting hurt, but here it’s used to refer to m oney or things you give a group of people so that they will not hurt you. Usually t hese are criminals who say to you, “We won’t hurt you if you give us money.”

So really, they’re stealing something from you, jus t in a different way. They’re taking your money – or in this case, your “merchand ise” – so that you won’t get hurt even worse. Jason says, “Protection? From whom ?” Ida says, “Those guys,” meaning those men. “They rule this neighborhood.” “ To rule” (rule) means to be in control or to have power over someone else. Ida explains, “If a business doesn’t pay up, they resort to violence.” “To pay u p” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give someone money that you owe that per son, especially when you don’t really want to give him any money.

If, for example, you borrow money from another pers on, that person eventually will ask you to pay up, to give him the money that you borrowed from him. Ida says, “If businesses don’t pay up,” meaning don’t g ive money to these criminals,

the criminals “resort (resort) to violence.” “To re sort to violence” means to start hurting other people physically or even killing peo ple. When you feel you have no other choice or no other option, you resort to viol ence when more peaceful methods don’t work.

Jason says, “You mean this is a shakedown?” A “shak edown” (shakedown) is when someone tells you that something bad will happ en to you if you don’t give that person money. A shakedown is often done when s omeone discovers something bad about you, that if other people found  out would be embarrassing or perhaps hurt you in some way. So, the person say s, “I won’t tell anyone if you give me some money.” That’s a kind of “shakedown.” Here, the shakedown involves not hurting the business as long as the bu siness gives the criminals some money.

Jason then asks, “They’re threatening you with viol ence unless you pay?” “To threaten” (threaten) means to say to someone that b ad things will happen to that person unless that person does what you want him to  do. Ida says, “Yes” – yes, they’re threatening me. “But what else can I do? Al l of the businesses on this street pay one way or another.”

Jason says, “But a protection racket is extortion. It’s against the law. You could tell the police.” A “protection racket” (racket) is  an illegal agreement with a group of people to protect people and businesses if those  businesses or those people give money to a certain group of criminals. Any kin d of “racket” is an illegal agreement. So, a “protection racket” is an illegal agreement that is about not hurting someone if that person gives you money, or in this case, a group of criminals money.

Jason says a protection racket is “extortion” (exto rtion). “Extortion” is a crime. It’s the act of getting someone to do something because you threaten that person – that is, you say to that person, “I’m going to hurt  you unless you do something that I want you to do.” You can hurt people in many  different ways. It doesn’t have to be just hitting them or hurting them physic ally. You could do other things to hurt a person. All of those things would be rela ted to this crime of extortion – when you tell someone he has to do something for yo u, and if he doesn’t, then you will do something bad to him.

Ida explains that even though this is against the l aw, she can’t tell the police. Why? Well, because she says, “The last person who s quealed had his store torched.” “To squeal” (squeal) means to report some one’s bad or illegal behavior to the government or the police or someone who is, we would say, “in authority.” The verb “to squeal” is meant to have a negative co nnotation – that is, it’s

supposed to be a bad thing to tell the police or to  tell the teacher that someone else is doing something wrong.

Another word for that is “tattling.” “To tattle” (t attle) means to report someone to the authorities. We also use the phrasal verb “to t ell on” someone. If a child says to another friend of his, “Don’t tell on me,” he me ans don’t tell his mother or the teacher that he did something wrong. We usually thi nk this is a bad thing, probably because we value loyalty, protecting our f riends and relationships.

Ida, in any case, says that this other person who d id tell the police had his store “torched” (torched). If you have your house or your  store or your building “torched,” someone has burned it down. Someone has started a fire to burn it down in order to destroy it. Ida continues, “I’m no t going up against these guys.” “To go up against” someone is to oppose someone or to try to beat someone, especially someone who’s powerful. “Things could ge t ugly, really ugly,” Ida says. The expression “to get ugly” means to become danger ous or unpleasant, or to have a bad result.

“Are you leaving?” Ida then says to Jason. Jason sa ys, “Yeah, I’m going to try to find that guy who was here and talk to him, tell hi m to lay off you.” The phrasal verb “to lay (lay) off” usually means to stop doing  something. In this case, it means to stop bothering another person. If you are bothering someone, perhaps criticizing him or making fun of him, he might say,  “Lay off me,” meaning stop criticizing, stop bothering me.

Ida says, “You can’t do that. Those guys mean busin ess.” The expression “to mean (mean) business” means to be very serious abou t what you do, to not be joking or pretending. Ida says, “They’ll hurt you.”  Jason says, “Not a chance,” meaning no, they won’t. That’s not even possible. “ When I tell them you’re under my protection, they’ll lay off for sure,” meaning t hey will definitely stop when I tell them that I am going to protect you.

But Ida says, “Stop! I’m not letting you stick your  neck out for me.” The phrase “to stick (stick) your neck (neck) out for” someone, or  simply “to stick your neck out,” means to do something that might cause you harm, to  do something “risky” (risky), to do something dangerous, something that may cause you to get hurt. Ida does not want Jason stick his neck out for her.

She says, “Your funeral won’t be on my head.” A “fu neral” (funeral) is a service or a ceremony or simply some event that is done when s omeone dies, usually to remember that person. Ida is saying that she doesn’ t want Jason’s funeral to be

on her head, meaning to be something she is respons ible for, or more importantly something that she will be blamed for, something she will be guilty of.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
