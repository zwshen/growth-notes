This episode is called “Having a Wild Party.”  It’s a dia logue between Paula and Mitch about someone who’s having a party that’s a little too crazy.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Paula:  Okay, let’s get this party started! 

Mitch:  I really don’t think having a party is such a good  idea.  We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t wan t their house used for a big blowout.   

Paula:  Ignorance is bliss.  They’ll never know.  Stop bei ng such a goody two- shoes and help me set up. 

Mitch:  What if something gets broken or damaged?  Thi ngs usually get out of hand when people start pounding back a few. 

Paula:  What do you think I’m doing?  I’m moving the  breakables to the other room.  Nothing will happen. 

Mitch:  How can you say that?  At Kyle’s party last month,  two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house! 

Paula:  That’s because they didn’t have Babbit. 

Mitch:  What’s a Babbit? 

 Paula:  Babbit is the name of an old high school frie nd of mine and he’s tough as nails.  He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line.  Trust me. Nothing bad will happen with Babbit playing bouncer.  Where are you going? 

Mitch:  I’m getting out while I can.  This is a disaster  waiting to happen. 

Paula:  You’re not staying for the party?  You’re leavi ng? 

Mitch:  Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic? 

[end of dialogue] 

We begin with Paula saying to Mitch, “Okay, let’s get th is party started!”  Let’s start our party – our celebration.  Mitch says, “I really don’t think having a party is such a good idea.”  It’s not a good idea, Mitch thinks.  “We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t want th eir house used for a big blowout.”  “To house-sit” means to take care of someone’s home – someone’s house when that person is gone, perhaps because they’re t raveling.  You might stay at their house or apartment; you might just go over  every day or every week to check to make sure the house is okay, check the mail for exam ple.  A “blowout” is a big party, it’s something where you have m any people and a lot of noise; it’s a loud party.  Usually, we think about this a djective, “blowout,” when we’re talking about a party perhaps for college student s who are drinking and yelling.  That would be an example of a blowout.  Th ere are several words in English that use “out.”  “Blowout” is what we call a co mpound word; it’s the word “blow” plus the word “out” together as one word.  For  more examples of this take a look at our Learning Guide for this episode. 

So Mitch says that he and Paula are house-sitting, are wa tching this house for perhaps friends or family, the Abrams family, and that they would not want a big party in their house.  Paula uses next an expression that i s common: “Ignorance is bliss” (bliss).  “To be ignorant” means not to know some thing.  “Bliss” is an old word for being very happy.  The expression “ignorance is b liss” means that sometimes it’s better not to know.  If you know, then you’ ll feel worse; but if you don’t know, well then, it’s not a problem.  For exampl e, someone says to you, “Do you know how many calories are in this doughnut?”  I f you eat too many doughnuts you’ll get fat.  Too many calories will make yo u fat – just ask the average American!  That’s an example of a place where yo u could use this expression.  Someone says, “Do you know how many calories are in this doughnut?” and you say, “Ignorance is bliss,” meaning I d on’t want to know, I’m happier if I don’t know.    

 Paula says that the Abrams will never know, they’ll never find out – unless they’re listening to this podcast!  She says, “Stop being su ch a goody two-shoes and help me set up.”  The expression “a goody (goody) tw o-shoes,” that’s “two (two) -shoes,” like what you put on your feet.  I’m not  sure the origin, where the expression comes from, but “goody two-shoes” is a person wh o always does what he or she is supposed to.  It’s really sort of an insu lting, negative term; you’re saying that this person is always perfect.  The idea  is that maybe they’re a little boring or maybe that they don’t like to have fun  because they never do anything wrong.  Paula wants Mitch to help her set up.   “To set up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to organize and prepare an event: to put the tables up, to put the chairs by the tables, and so forth. 

However, Mitch is worried, he says, “What if something g ets broken or damaged?  Things (meaning the situation) usually get o ut of hand when people start pounding back a few.”  “To get out of hand” mean s to get out of control.  If a teachers says, “My class is getting out of hand,” she means t he class is getting wild, it’s getting loud, she can’t control it.  Mitch says that this situation will get out of hand – will become uncontrollable when people start  pounding a few back. The expression “to pound (pound) back a few,” or “to pou nd a few back,” means to be drinking many alcoholic beverages: one beer, one gl ass of wine, then another beer, then another beer.  When you’re drinkin g then quickly, we would say that you are pounding a few back.  It means to drink a  lot of alcohol quickly. 

Paula says, “What do you think I’m doing?  I’m moving the  breakables to the other room.  Nothing will happen.”  Something that is “breakable” is something that is able to be broken, something that can break easil y.  They are many words in English that use this “able” (able) at the end, for  example: “This is doable.” That means you can do it, it is able to be done.  So, so mething that is “breakable,” is something that you can break.  Paula is moving all of the breakables into another room, where the party will n ot be.  She tells Mitch, “Nothing will happen,” nothing bad will happen. 

Mitch says, “How can you say that (that’s not possible)?  At K yle’s party last month, two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house!”  When you say two people “got into it” you mean they had a fight or an argument; often it means that they are hitting each other.  Well, at a p arty last month two guys (two men; two boys) got into it (had a fight) and ended up  (as a result of their fight) trashing his parents’ house.  “To trash,” here, means to  destroy or to break something, or to make something very dirty and disorgani zed.  If the house is full of dirt, and there are things that are broken, and th ere is glass, for example, on  

 the floor, we might say that someone trashed the house.  In this case, it was the two guys who were fighting. 

Paula says, “That’s because they didn’t have Babbit.”  The  party did not have Babbit.  Mitch says, “What’s a Babbit?”  Paula explains, “Babbit is the name of an old high school friend of mine and he’s tough as nails.”   The expression “to be tough as nails” means to be very strong; you can’t hurt t his person.  Usually it’s a big person, a very strong person.  “Nails” are little pie ces of metal we use to put into wood, usually to connect or put something on the wood.  You could also use nails on your wall to put up a picture.  Paula says that  her old friend, Babbit, is as tough as nails.  “He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line.”  “To bust heads” means to hurt another person with physical fo rce.  So, Babbit is going to make sure there are no fights; he’s going to ke ep everybody in line.  “To keep everybody or everyone in line” means to do something  so that everyone behaves, no one does anything badly.  A good teacher has to keep her students in line, make sure they aren’t doing anything crazy.  As your teacher, I hope you’re not doing anything crazy while you’re listening to  this episode!  Paula says, “Trust me.  Nothing bad will happen with Babbit p laying bouncer.”  A “bouncer” is a strong person, usually a man, who works at  a bar or at a party.  He makes sure that no one causes any problems, no one gets into  a fight.  “To play bouncer” means, in this case, to work as a bouncer.   

Paula then says to Mitch, “Where are you going?”  Mitch sa ys, “I’m getting out (meaning I’m leaving) while I can (while I am able to ).  This is a disaster waiting to happen.”  The expression “a disaster (a horrible th ing; a bad thing) waiting to happen” means that you know something very bad is going to happen because what you are doing is a bad idea.  A young child in the  kitchen while you are cooking is a disaster waiting to happen; something bad is going to happen because the situation is dangerous. 

Paula says, “You’re not staying for the party?  You’re le aving?”  Mitch says, “Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic?”  The “Tita nic,” you may know, was a British ship that sank in 1912; it went down into the water and killed more than 1,500 people.  Nowadays, we often use it in English as an example of a horrible disaster – a huge disaster.  Or maybe we say that because it  was a terrible movie, I’m not sure! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue]

Mitch:  I really don’t think having a party is such a good  idea.  We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t wan t their house used for a big blowout.
