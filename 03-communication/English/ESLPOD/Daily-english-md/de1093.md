This episode is a dialogue between Bill and Madison  about having a picnic – going out and eating outside somewhere. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Bill: Surprise! I brought you here to this beautifu l spot for a romantic picnic. I have a very special question to ask you.

Madison: Oh, that’s so sweet. Did you remember to bring a picnic blanket?

Bill: I did. I have everything we’ll need in this p icnic basket.

Madison: Don’t put it down there. There are ants. You should put it on the blanket.

Bill: Yes, you’re right.

Madison: And I hope you remembered to bring somethi ng to drink. I’m thirsty.

Bill: I brought both food and a bottle of champagne .

Madison: Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold and t he champagne isn’t too warm. You know how I hate warm champagne.

Bill: Actually, the food is cold, because I brought  chicken sandwiches and potato salad.

Madison: Oh, I thought you would have brought somet hing a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special.

 Bill: That’s why I brought the champagne. It’ll mak e this picnic extra special.

Madison: I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches. I hope you remembered to bring a corkscrew and some  dishes and silverware.

Bill: I bought paper plates and plastic utensils.

Madison: Paper and plastic? I guess we’ll have to make do with those, too. Okay, now, you said you had a special question you wanted  to ask me. What is it?

Bill: Question? Oh, never mind. It’ll keep.

Bill says to Madison, “Surprise! I brought you here  to this beautiful spot for a romantic picnic.” A “spot” (spot) here just means a  location or area. Bill has brought Madison, his wife or girlfriend – maybe it’ s the girlfriend and the wife is at home, I don’t know – to this beautiful spot for a r omantic picnic. A “picnic” (picnic) is a meal that you usually eat in a park or in some  nice area. You often sit on the grass and have a small meal – a lunch, let’s say.

Bill says, “I have a very special question to ask y ou.” Madison says, “Oh, that’s so sweet.” If something is “sweet,” it’s nice, or p erhaps in this case, “romantic.” Madison asks, “Did you remember to bring a picnic b lanket?” A “blanket” (blanket) is normally something you put over yourse lf to keep warm. Here, however, it’s used to mean something you would put on the ground so that you don’t have to sit on the dirt or perhaps on the wet  grass.

Bill says, “I did,” meaning I did remember. “I have  everything we’ll need in this picnic basket.” A “picnic basket” (basket) is usual ly a large container in which you put the items you will need for your picnic. So, yo u put all of your food and your plates, your napkins, your knives and forks, if you  need them, into this large container called a “basket.” A picnic basket is use d to transport food and other items needed for a picnic.

Madison tells Bill, “Don’t put it down there. There  are ants.” “Ants” (ants) are small insects that have little body parts and legs that often go after food if it is left outdoors. Madison is telling Bill not to put the pi cnic basket in a certain place because she sees that that place has ants. She says , “You should put it on the blanket.” Bill says, “Yes, you’re right.” Madison c ontinues, “And I hope you remembered to bring something to drink. I’m thirsty .”

 Madison seems to be making a lot of demands on Bill , seems to be asking him for a lot of things. She says she’s thirsty and the refore hopes that Bill remembered to bring something to drink for her, of course. Bill says, “I brought both food and a bottle of champagne.” “Champagne” ( champagne) is a white sparkling wine, a bubbly wine that is from a certai n region in France. In order to be sold as champagne in many countries, it has to b e only from that region in France.

Madison says, “Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold  and the champagne isn’t too warm.” So, already we don’t like Madison, right? I mean, she’s complaining now that perhaps the food will be cold and the champagn e will be warm. Of course you want the champagne to be cold and, if it’s supp osed to be hot, the food to be warm. She says, “You know how I hate warm champagne .”

Bill says, “Actually, the food is cold, because I b rought chicken sandwiches and potato salad.” Bill is saying that the food is cold  but it’s supposed to be cold, because he brought some chicken sandwiches and pota to salad. A “sandwich,” of course, is a popular food in the United States. It’s made with two pieces of bread, typically, and in between the two pieces of bread you put meat, vegetables, and other things to eat.

“Potato salad” is a cold mixture of chopped potatoe s – potatoes cut up into small pieces that have been baked – combined with mayonna ise, typically, onions, celery, and some other things. Potato salad is a ve ry popular picnic food in the United States, especially during the summer. Whenev er my family would have big family parties in the summertime, there would a lways be potato salad.

Madison says, “Oh, I thought you would have brought  something a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special .” Madison is complaining now that what Bill brought on this surprise picnic isn’ t very “gourmet or lavish.” “Gourmet” (gourmet) refers to very good tasting foo d that usually is expensive and often takes a long time to prepare. The word “l avish” (lavish) as an adjective means expensive or luxurious. If we are talking abo ut food, “lavish” would be very expensive, very good-looking and good-tasting food.

Bill says, “That’s why I brought the champagne” – i n order to bring something a little special for the event. “It’ll make this picn ic extra special,” he says. Madison continues complaining, “I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches.” “To make do” is an interesting two -word phrasal verb meaning to be satisfied with something that isn’t exactly w hat you want – to be able to get

by or to survive through a certain situation not having all of the resources, all of the things that you would like to have in a perfect  world or ideally.

Madison is saying that she and Bill will “have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches.” She says, “I hope you remembered t o bring a corkscrew and some dishes and silverware.” A “corkscrew” (corkscr ew) is a special tool that you use to remove the very top of a wine or champagne b ottle. Technically, you’re removing the little piece that is put into the top of the bottle to keep the liquid inside of it. That little piece is called a “cork,”  and hence a corkscrew screws into or goes into the cork in order to allow you to pull  it out.

“Dishes” are, of course, the things that you use for eating – plates and bowls, for example. We use the term “silverware” to mean the s ame as “eating utensils” – that is to say knives, forks, and spoons. Technical ly, silverware would be eating utensils made out of or plated with silver, but we use the term more generally to mean the knives, forks, and spoons that you eat wit h.

Bill said, “I bought paper plates and plastic utens ils.” So, he has plates made of paper and utensils – that is again a knife, a fork,  a spoon – made of plastic, which is quite common on a picnic. You often bring paper and plastic to eat with. Madison is not impressed. She says, “Paper and plas tic?” She’s not happy. She continues, “I guess we’ll have to make do with thos e, too. Okay, now, you said you had a special question you wanted to ask me. What is it?”

We can guess by now that Bill was going to ask Madi son to marry him. He was going to propose to her. “To propose” here means to  ask someone to marry you. But after all of the questions that Madison has ask ed, all the complaints that she has, Bill has decided, we believe, not to ask Madis on to marry him. He says, “Question? Oh, never mind.” “Never mind” is a phrase meaning that whatever you were talking about is not important and that the other person should just forget about it.

He says that the question “will keep” (keep). To say something will keep means that it doesn’t have to be done right now, or it do esn’t have to be talked about right now. It’s something you can do in the future.  Maybe Bill will change his mind and decide never to ask Madison to marry him. That would be my advice.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
