This episode is a dialogue between Martin and Georg ina about trying to pay your loans by doing certain kinds of work, instead of by  giving money back to the bank. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Martin: One hundred eleven days and counting. 

Georgina: Are you counting down to something? 

Martin: I’m counting down to the day when my studen t loans will be discharged. I only took this job because it qualifies for the loa n forgiveness program. 

Georgina: But you’ve worked here for over two years  already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans all this  time? 

Martin: That’s right. I took out loans to subsidize  my college education. After I graduated, I had a choice to either start repaying the loans or work in a public service job for three years. 

Georgina: Three years is a long commitment. 

Martin: You’re telling me, but I had no choice. It was either that or be indebted for the next 10 to 15 years. I couldn’t take that. 

Georgina: Now I get it. 

Martin: Get what? 

Georgina: I’ve noticed you’ve been happier lately a nd I thought you were finally enjoying your work here, but now I know it’s becaus e you’re getting closer to getting out from under your loans. 

Martin: That’s right. In less than four months I’ll  be free at last, free at last!

Martin begins our dialogue by saying, “One hundred eleven days and counting.” The expression “and counting” is used to show that you are talking about a number that is continuing to change – often in a di rection that you want it to change. So, for example, if your company sells a hu ndred thousand dollars worth of goods, you might say, “Well, we sold one hundred  thousand dollars and counting,” which means I expect we will sell even m ore. We are continuing to sell and that number will get higher.  

Martin says, “One hundred eleven days and counting. ” But here, he means it in the opposite way – of the number is going down ever y day. That’s why Georgina says, “Are you counting down to something?” “To cou nt down” is a phrasal verb meaning to count backwards until an event happens. So, we might say there are 264 days left until Christmas, and tomorrow there w ill be 263 days left until Christmas, and so on. You are counting down. 

Martin says, “I’m counting down to the day when my student loans will be discharged.” “Student loans” are loans that you get  from a bank – money that you get from a bank, typically, that you use to pay for  your university or college expenses. When a loan is “discharged” (discharged),  we mean that you no longer have to pay it because you have done somethi ng that the government or the bank accepts in lieu of, or in place of, money.   

To have a loan “discharged” is to do something othe r than pay money back, typically – that the government says, “Okay, you do n’t have to pay any more money back because you did this.” This has become q uite popular for certain kinds of student loans in the United States. The go vernment or the bank gives you money, but then you have to do something – typi cally you have to work at a certain job or in a certain area – and if you do th at, then the government will forgive your loan. It will discharge your loan and not make you pay it back.  

Martin says, “I only took this job because it quali fies for the loan forgiveness program.” “To qualify for” something is to meet the  requirements for something. A “loan forgiveness program” is what I was just talki ng about – a program where, instead of paying the bank or the government back m oney that you loaned from  

them, you do something and the government says, “Ok ay, you don’t have to pay it back.”  

Now, typically these programs are for teachers or s ometimes doctors or nurses who agree to work in certain places that need teach ers or doctors or nurses. It’s usually not a place where a lot of people want to g o or a place where people want to work, and that’s why the government says, “ Well, if you work here for two years or three years or however many years it takes  according to the loan forgiveness program, then you will not have to pay the loan back. You will not have to give the bank or the government back money.   

I actually had one of these loans when I became a t eacher, a high school teacher. I received a loan from the federal governm ent, and if I worked for a certain number of years as a teacher, I would not h ave to pay the loan back. That’s a loan forgiveness program. 

Georgina says, “You’ve worked here for over two yea rs already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans a ll this time?” Georgina was not aware – did not know – that Martin was working at this job, whatever this job is, for the past two years so that he could pay off  his student loans. “To pay off” is a phrasal verb meaning to make all of the payments on a debt that you have. So, if you borrow a thousand dollars from the bank and you “pay it off,” you pay the bank back the thousand dollars plus, of course, wha t is called “interest,” which is the money the bank charges to loan you money.  

Martin here isn’t technically giving the bank or th e government money. He is working in this job as a way of paying off his stud ent loan, of getting rid of the student loan, if you will. Martin says, “That’s rig ht” – that’s correct – “I took out loans to subsidize my college education.” I got loa ns to pay for my college education. That’s what Martin means here. “To subsi dize” is to provide financial support for something that you would not otherwise be able to afford.  

Martin says, “After I graduated, I had a choice to either start repaying the loans or work in a public service job for three years.” Mart in says when he finished his college education – when he got his college degree – he had a choice of one of two things. He could either take a regular job and start paying the loans back with money, or he could work in a public service job for  three years. “Public service” refers to jobs that help the public, usually govern ment jobs that help the public.  

Georgina says, “Three years is a long commitment.” A “commitment” (commitment) is a promise to do something, an oblig ation to do something. Georgina thinks three years is a long commitment, a  long time to say you’re  

going to work at this job. That really depends, of course. It depends on how much money you are going to save by not having to pay it  back to the government.  

Martin, however, agrees with Georgina. You’re telli ng me.” That expression, “You’re telling me,” is an informal way of showing your agreement with what the other person said. So, someone may say to you, “Thi s examination is really hard. This test is really hard,” and you agree with that person. You may say, “You’re telling me,” meaning yes, I agree with you. Martin says, “I had no choice.” Well, actually, Martin did have a choice. He had a choice  of not going to college and taking out the loan. But we continue, “It was eithe r that or be indebted for the next ten to fifteen years.”  

Martin says either he worked at this job for three years – this public service job – as part of the loan forgiveness program, or he woul d be “indebted” (indebted) for the next ten to fifteen years. “To be indebted” is to owe money to someone. Sometimes we use that expression, “I’m indebted to you,” when a person does something very nice for you or something perhaps th at cost a lot of money, even. You may say to them, “I’m indebted to you” – I real ly appreciate what you’ve done for me, and I hope someday to be able to do so mething good for you. That’s the general idea.  

Here, however, Martin is talking about actually bei ng indebted, actually having to pay money to the bank or the government or whomever  he got the loan from. Georgina says, “Now I get it,” meaning now I unders tand. Martin says, “Get what?” What do you understand? Georgina says, “I’ve  noticed you’ve been happier lately” – recently – “and I thought you wer e finally enjoying your work here, but now I know it’s because you’re getting cl oser to getting out from under your loans.”  

Georgina has noticed that Martin has become happier  recently and now she understands why: because he is getting closer to th e point where he no longer has to work at this job. He’s getting closer to get ting out from under his loans. “To get out from under” means to be freed of some burde n, to be relieved of some burden or obligation. You no longer have to do some thing that you had to do but didn’t want to do. Martin says, “That’s right. In l ess than four months, I’ll be free at last, free at last!”  

This expression “free at last” means that you will be finally freed of this obligation. You will finally no longer have to do this thing th at you don’t want to do. This expression “free at last, free at last” is actually  one that became famous in the early 1960s, when the late Reverend Martin Luther K ing gave a famous speech in Washington, and at the end or towards the end of  the speech, he used the  

phrase “Free at last, free at last” to talk about t he liberation, or the potential freeing, of African Americans from the discriminati on and the racism that existed in American society at that time.  

Martin, of course, is not talking about being free of discrimination. He’s talking about being free of having to pay his loans.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Georgina: Are you counting down to something?
