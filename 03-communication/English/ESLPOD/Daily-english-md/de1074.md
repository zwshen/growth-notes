[start of dialogue]

Ashley: I’m thinking of becoming a vegetarian. I th ink it would be the ethical thing to do.

Paul: Are you going to eat eggs and dairy? If you’r e doing this for ethical reasons, you really should avoid anything made with  animal products or animal by-products.

Ashley: I guess you’re right.

Paul: Then you’re going to be a vegan. You won’t be  able to eat any milk, butter, cheese, or yogurt.

Ashley: Really? I guess I’ll have to be a vegan the n.

Paul: You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’t  have a vitamin deficiency.

Ashley: Yes, I’ll have to guard against that.

Paul: Are you going to avoid buying things that are  animal-derived, too? Like leather shoes and belts?

Ashley: I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I shoul d.

Paul: Are you having second thoughts?

Ashley: No, I just didn’t know there would be so ma ny restrictions.

 Paul: Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fr uitarian.

Ashley: What’s that?

Paul: You don’t want to know.

Our dialogue begins with Ashley saying to Paul, “I’ m thinking of becoming a vegetarian.” A “vegetarian” (vegetarian) is a perso n who doesn’t eat meat, the meat of animals such as cows or pigs or chickens. A  vegetarian might not eat meat for a variety of reasons. In the case of Ashle y in our story, it’s because she thinks it is “the ethical thing to do.” “Ethical” ( ethical) refers to something that is good – the right or correct thing to do in a situat ion, the moral thing to do. That’s what Ashley thinks being a vegetarian is all about – being ethical.

Paul says, “Are you going to eat eggs and dairy?” “ Dairy” (dairy) is something that is related to milk – milk itself, or other thi ngs that are made from milk. Paul is asking Ashley if she is going to eat eggs and milk,  since those things come from animals even though they are not animals themselves . Paul says, “If you’re doing this for ethical reasons, you should really avoid a nything made with animal products or animal by-products.”

There are two terms here to explain. The first is “ animal products.” A “product” is something that comes from something else, something  that is produced. “Animal products” would be anything that is made from one o r more parts of an animal. “Animal by-products” (by-products) are things that are made from animal parts, usually created as a consequence of making somethin g else.

For example, chicken farmers mainly try to get eggs  from chickens, or they kill the chicken in order to sell the meat of the chicke n, but one of the by-products of having chickens is that chickens, like most of us, create a certain waste product. They – well, to put it in the terms of a young chil d, they “poop” (poop). “Poop” is what you do when you go to the bathroom – well, at least one of the things.

Anyway, I’m not sure how we got on this topic. Oh y es, animal by-products are things that animals produce or that you get from an  animal in the process of doing something else or making something else. I th ink that would be the general idea. So, in the case of chicken poop, it would be perhaps to make fertilizer – something you would put on the ground so that you c ould grow food more easily.

Ashley says, “I guess you’re right,” meaning that s he agrees with Paul that she should probably not eat eggs or dairy. Paul says, “ Then you’re going to be a vegan” (vegan). A “vegan,” if I understand correctl y, is a person who doesn’t eat any animal products. That means that vegans not onl y don’t eat meat, they don’t eat eggs or use any dairy products.

Paul says, “You won’t be able to eat any milk, butt er, cheese, or yogurt.” “Butter,” you may know, is something that is made in part fro m cream and has typically a lot of fat in it. “Cheese” is a solid food made fro m milk. We use cheese in all sorts of cooking. Lots of Italian pasta dishes, for examp le, have cheese in them. Paul also talks about “yogurt” (yogurt). Yogurt is also made from milk, often something that is sweetened with fruit or sugar, especially t he kind of yogurt you buy at the store that has flavors like strawberry.

Ashley says, “Really? I guess I’ll have to be a veg an then.” Paul continues; he says, “You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’ t have a vitamin deficiency.” A “diet” refers to the kinds of food that you eat. “V aried” means that you need to eat different kinds of things, and the reason Paul is t elling Ashley she needs to eat different kinds of food is to avoid a “vitamin (vit amin) deficiency (deficiency).”

A “deficiency” is when you don’t have enough of som ething. So, a vitamin deficiency is when you don’t have enough vitamins. “Vitamins” are usually classified by a letter – vitamin A, vitamin C, vita min D. There various different kinds of vitamin B. Vitamins are necessary for heal th, and they can be found in many different kinds of food, depending on the vita min.

Ashley says, “Yes, I’ll have to guard against that. ” “To guard (guard) against” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to pre vent something from happening, to protect yourself from something dange rous that might happen. You can guard against something physical like someone t rying to hit you, but more often than not, we use the expression “to guard aga inst” when we’re talking about things that we want to avoid doing – things t hat we want to prevent from happening.

Paul says, “Are you going to avoid buying things th at are animal-derived too?” The word “derived” (derived) comes from the verb “t o derive.” “To derive” means to get something from somewhere else. We could talk  about words in English that are “derived” from words in Latin or in French  or in German. Here, the expression in the dialogue is “animal-derived,” whi ch would mean that it comes from, or is made from, animals.

Paul says, “Like leather shoes and belts?” “Leather ” (leather) is a material made from the skin of an animal, usually a cow. Paul is telling Ashley that she’s going to have to stop buying leather shoes and belts. A “ belt” (belt) is what goes around the top of your pants to keep them from falling dow n. Ashley says, “I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I should,” meaning “I su ppose I should avoid buying things that are animal derived also.”

Paul then asks, “Are you having second thoughts?” I f someone asks you if you’re having second thoughts about something, it means th at they are asking you if you are doubting your decision, if you are thinking  about changing your mind, because maybe now when you think about it a little more, you think you might have made the wrong decision. That’s “’having secon d thoughts.”

If you ask a young woman to marry you and she goes home and comes back and tells you that she’s having second thoughts abo ut actually getting married to you, that’s usually not a good sign. You probably want to find a new girlfriend. Anyway, Ashley says “No,” meaning no, I’m not havin g second thoughts. I’m not doubting my decision. “I just didn’t know there wou ld be so many restrictions.” “Restrictions” are limits on what you can do – rule s or regulations that prevent you from doing certain things.

Paul then says, “Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fruitarian.” A “fruitarian” (fruitarian) is a person who eats main ly fruit, usually fruit that falls off from a plant or a tree and that can be taken withou t harming the plant or tree. So, it’s not just fruit that you might find on a tree. Usually fruitarians, if I understand correctly, will only eat fruit that has fallen off of a tree – naturally, if you will. Are there really fruitarians in the world? Well, Dr. Lu cy Tse thinks so, because she put the word in our dialogue.

Ashley says, “What’s that?” She doesn’t know what a  fruitarian is. Paul says, “You don’t want to know.” When you hear that expres sion, “You don’t want to know,” the person is indicating that this informati on that you don’t know might be information that you don’t really want to know, bec ause it will confuse you or make you angry or perhaps make you sad. When someon e says, “You don’t want to know,” they’re saying that the information that you are asking about is something that is going to hurt you or perhaps upse t you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
