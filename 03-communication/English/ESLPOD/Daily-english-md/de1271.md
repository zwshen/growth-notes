This episode is a dialogue between Ellie and Lauren t about disapproving or not liking someone marrying a second time – “remarrying ,” we would say. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ellie: I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone  with my mother and she dropped a bombshell.

Laurent: What did she tell you?

Ellie: She’s thinking of remarrying.

Laurent: Are your parents divorced?

Ellie: No, my mother is a widow. My father passed a way eight years ago.

Laurent: Oh, I’m sorry. You don’t approve of your p rospective stepfather?

Ellie: Uh, don’t use that term. I don’t like or dis like him. It’s just that my mother should not be remarrying – period. She should stay true to my father’s memory.

Laurent: After eight years?

Ellie: Theirs was a picture-perfect marriage. How c ould she forget about it and take up with this other guy?

Laurent: Don’t you want your mother to move on and be happy?

Ellie: By replacing my father with this new guy?

 Laurent: I’m sure she’s not trying to replace him. She just wants a new love in her life.

Ellie: My father was the love of her life. This oth er guy is a pale substitute.

Laurent: Can’t you just be happy for her?

Ellie: I’m never betraying my father’s memory.

Laurent: Does that mean you’ll never marry?

Ellie: Well, no, I can stay true to my father’s mem ory and still get married.

Laurent: So can your mother!

This episode is about someone getting married again . It could be for the second time. It could be for the third, fourth, fifth, six th, or seventh time, but I think we’re just talking about the second time here. Ellie begi ns by saying to Laurent, “I don’t believe it. I just got off the phone with my mother ,” meaning I just was talking on the telephone to my mother, “and she dropped a bomb shell.” The expression “to drop (drop) a bombshell (bombshell)” means to make a very surprising, shocking announcement – to tell someone some news that is us ually bad news and very surprising news.

Ellie says her mother “dropped a bombshell,” meanin g told her some very surprising news. Laurent says, “What did she tell y ou?” Ellie responds, “She’s thinking of remarrying.” “To remarry” (remarry) mea ns to marry again, either after you have had a divorce – meaning you’ve ended a pre vious marriage with your husband or wife – or after your husband or wife has  died.

Laurent says, “Are your parents divorced?” “To be d ivorced” (divorced) means to marry and then to end your marriage legally – to go  to the government and say, “I am no longer married to this woman” or “I’m no long er married to this man.” Well, of course, you both have to declare that you’re not  married, although in many states in the U.S., probably in most states, even i f you don’t want to be divorced you can have your marriage ended by your husband or  wife.

Ellie says her mother is not divorced. Her mother i s a “widow” (widow). A “widow” is a woman whose husband has died. The term for a m an would be a “widower”

(widower). A “widower” is a man whose wife has died . There are many more widows in the world than widowers because women ten d to live longer than men. Men are probably more likely to marry a woman young er than them than a woman is to marry a man. I’m not sure what the stat istics are on that. That’s just my impression – what I think is true.

In any case, Ellie’s mother is a widow. She says he r father “passed away eight years ago.” The expression “to pass (pass) away” me ans simply to die, but it’s a nicer way of saying “to die.” You may ask a friend of yours, “When did your father pass away?” That sounds better than saying, “When d id your father die?” It depends on the situation, but “to pass away” is usu ally considered a more polite way of saying “die.”

Laurent says, “Oh, I’m sorry.” Once again, it might  be the case that if you didn’t know that someone’s friend – or in this case, paren t – has died and the person tells you, you might say, “Oh, I’m sorry,” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” “You don’t approve of your prospective stepfather?” Laurent sa ys. “To approve” means to think something is good or acceptable. “I approve o f him” means I think he’s a good person, or I think he’s acceptable for whateve r the situation is. Laurent is asking Ellie if she approves of her “prospective (p rospective) stepfather (stepfather).” “Prospective” means “potential,” som ething that might happen in the future.

The term “stepfather” is used to refer to a man who  marries a woman who already has children. The man will legally make him self the father of those children. In that case, we would call that man thei r – or the children’s – “stepfather.”

Ellie says, “Uh, don’t use that term.” The “term” i s a word – in this case, the word “stepfather.” She then says, “I don’t like or disli ke him. It’s just that my mother should not be remarrying – period.” Ellie doesn’t h ate the new boyfriend of her mother. However, she does not think her mother shou ld “be remarrying – period” (period).

The word “period” here is used to mean “at all.” It ’s a word that we use for emphasis. A “period,” of course, is a small little round dot that goes at the end of a printed sentence in a book or in a document. It i ndicates the end of something, but when someone says it in a sentence like this, h e means to use that word as emphasis to say “at all” or “completely.” In Englan d, in British English, they call a period a “full stop,” and they use that term “full stop” the same way we use the word “period” in English.

Ellie says that her mother “should stay true” to he r father’s memory. “To stay true to” something means to remain loyal and faithful to  something, to remember something in such a way that you don’t deny it or r eject it. “Stay true to your wife” – that means don’t go out and try to find a new wom an. You must stay loyal to her. You must be faithful to her. You must only be with her and love her. That would be “staying true to” a person, in this case.

Ellie thinks that her mother should stay true not t o her father, since her father is dead now, but to her father’s “memory” (memory). “M emory” is how you remember someone – the idea about how someone was i n your mind. Laurent says, “After eight years?” He thinks that Ellie is asking too much of her mother to not get married just because the mother loved her f ather. Ellie says, “Theirs,” meaning their marriage – her mother’s and father’s – “was a picture-perfect marriage.” “Picture-perfect” is a term that means “ ideal,” one that was without any problems.

“How could she forget about it and take up with thi s other guy?” Ellie says. Ellie is saying here that she is surprised her mother would get married again, because to her that means that she has forgotten about her fat her. She uses the term “take up with” to describe her mother getting involved in  this new romantic relationship. However, we often use that expression “to take up w ith” in a negative way, when we don’t approve of or agree with someone starting a romantic relationship with another person.

Laurent says, “Don’t you want your mother to move o n and be happy?” The phrasal verb “to move on” means to end one thing an d begin a new thing. It is especially used when we’re talking about romantic r elationships. You end one relationship and then you forget about that one and  find a new romantic relationship. That’s called “moving on.” We also us e that phrasal verb to mean simply to continue on to something new, to stop tal king about or worrying about what has happened in the past, or with one particul ar issue. We move on – we continue on to a new thing.

Ellie says, “By replacing my father with this new g uy?” She thinks her mother is moving on by replacing the memory of her father. “T o replace” (replace) means to start using one thing instead of another thing. Laurent says, “I’m sure she’s not trying to replace him.” Laurent is telling Ellie th at he doesn’t think her mother is trying to replace her father. He says, “She just wa nts a new love in her life.” Ellie says, “My father was the love of her life.”

The “love of your life” is the person you think you  are meant to be with, the one and only person with whom you should be or toward w hom you could have a

deep kind of love. Ellie says, “This other guy,” me aning her mother’s new boyfriend, “is a pale substitute.” A “substitute” ( substitute) is a replacement for something, when you use one thing instead of someth ing else. “Pale” (pale) here means something that is inferior or worse than the original. So, a “pale substitute” would be something or someone that is not nearly as  good as the thing or person replaced.

Laurent says, “Can’t you just be happy for her?” El lie says, “I’m not betraying my father’s memory.” “To betray” (betray) someone or s omething means not to be true to or loyal to that person. If someone tells y ou a secret and then you say, “Okay, I won’t tell anyone else,” and you, the next  day, go and tell five other people, you have betrayed your friend. You have bet rayed the person who gave you that secret or told you that secret. You were n ot loyal or faithful to that person. Someone who sells secret information to ano ther government betrays his country – is not faithful to his country.

Ellie does not want to betray her father’s memory. Laurent says, “Does that mean you’ll never marry?” Ellie says, “Well, no, I can s tay true to my father’s memory and still get married.” Laurent says, “So can your mother!” meaning your mother can also get married and stay true to her father’s memory.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
