This episode is a dialogue between Lila and George about not talking about certain things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lila: Why aren’t you dating? I have so many friends  who would love to go out with you.

George: Let’s change the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.

Lila: But really, you’re not getting any younger an d . . .

George: Moving on! Have you seen any good movies la tely?

Lila: Listen, all of your friends are settling down  and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely . . .

George: That reminds me, didn’t you say that you we re going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home?

Lila: Forget about my dog. You remember Rachel, don ’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend and she’d be perfect for you.

George: Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother? Wasn ’t she in the hospital?

Lila: If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina? S he has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.

George: And now for something completely different . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?

Lila: I don’t really want to talk about my weight.

George: But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right? I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.

Lila: Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want  to talk about my diet . . .

George: You need to cut out sweets if you want to l ose weight. Are you eating too many sweets?

Lila: That’s none of your business!

George: My sentiments exactly!

Lila begins by asking George, “Why aren’t you datin g?” “To date” (date) means to be involved in a romantic relationship but not yet married – so, to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Lila wants to know why Geo rge isn’t dating. “I have so many friends who would love to go out with you,” Li la says. “To go out with” means to go on a romantic date with someone.

Notice the word “date,” as a noun, means a romantic  evening or afternoon with someone, spending time with someone, going to a mov ie or going to dinner. Those could be “dates.” You might consider a date a  romantic appointment – an appointment with someone who you are romantically i nterested in. “To go out with” someone means to be dating someone. It could also mean simply to go out on a date with someone.

George says, “Let’s change the subject.” “To change  the subject” (subject) means to stop talking about one thing and begin tal king about something else, especially when you don’t want to talk about the fi rst topic. If someone starts talking to you about his financial problems or his health problems and you don’t want to hear about it anymore, you may say, “Well, let’s change the subject.” You have to be careful, of course. You could insult som eone. You could be rude to someone by saying that out loud. You might just wan t to change the subject on your own without actually announcing that.

But George does announce it. He says, “Let’s change  the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.” Lila says, “B ut really, you are not getting any younger and . . .” That expression “you’re not gett ing any younger” would be used in a case where the person is telling someone that he or she may soon be too old to do something, especially in the case of one’s love life. You may say that to someone who you think is getting too old to  get married.

You may also say it about, for example, doing a lot  of traveling. If you think that your health will be bad as you get older – and usua lly it is – you might say, “Well we’re not getting any younger. Let’s take that trip  walking across Europe from Spain to Poland.” I don’t know – whatever thing tha t would involve your health that might not be possible in the future. Lila says , “You’re not getting any younger” to George.

George, however, is trying to change the subject. H e says, “Moving on . . .” “Moving on” is a phrase to indicate that you want t o stop talking about this topic and to talk about something else. George says, “Hav e you seen any good movies lately?” He’s trying to change the topic of conversation by talking about movies. But Lila doesn’t want to change the topic.

She says, “Listen, all of my friends are settling d own and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely.” “To settle (settle)  down” is a two-word phrasal verb that usually means to get married, to find a home, and to start a family. That would normally be the definition of “to settle down .” If a father says to his son, “You need to settle down,” the father is usually re ferring to the fact that the son needs to get married, to buy a house, and to start a family – or at the very least, to move out of his house.

Lila says that she doesn’t want George “to go throu gh life” – that is, to live the rest of his life – “alone and lonely.” “To be alone ” (alone) is to be by yourself, without anyone else. “To be lonely” means to feel s ad because you are by yourself or don’t have any close personal relations hips.

You can be “alone” without being lonely. You can be  by yourself in your house, for example, and not be lonely. You can be “lonely”  and not be alone. If you are with someone but you don’t feel close to that perso n, you could still feel lonely even though you’re not alone, at least in the physi cal sense. There’s someone else with you. Lila is afraid George will be alone and lonely.

George again tries to change the conversation, or t he topic of the conversation. He says, “That reminds me, didn’t you say that you were going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home ?” “That reminds me” is a

phrase we use, once again, to suddenly change topic s. Although it could be that you have suddenly thought of something – you’ve bee n reminded of something that you want to tell the other person. Here, howev er, it’s used by George to try to change the subject of the conversation again.

He asks Leila question about her dog. Again, Lila i sn’t interested in changing the topic. She says, “Forget about my dog. You remember  Rachel, don’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend.” “To break up wit h” someone is to end a romantic relationship with someone. Usually we use that when we’re talking about ending a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, n ot a marriage. If you are ending your marriage, you would probably say you’re gettin g divorced or separated. Lila thinks that her friend Rachel would be perfect for George.

George says, “Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother ? Wasn’t she in the hospital?” Notice again George is trying to change the subject. “Speaking of” is an expression we used to introduce a topic that is related to what the other person said but isn’t exactly the same. You may be talking about, say, going to Paris for a vacation, and someone may have just rea d a book about Paris. He could say to you, “Speaking of Paris, I just read t his wonderful book about Paris.”

George tries to change the subject and talk about R achel’s mother. Lila says, “If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina?” “Type” (t ype) here means the kind of person to whom you are romantically attracted, the kind of person in whom you are interested in. “What about Amina?” Lila says. “ She has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.” The expression “leg man” is an i nformal one referring to a man who might be attracted to women who have long, beau tiful legs.

George says, “And now for something completely diff erent . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?” Here, George is getting impatient with Lila. He’s starting to get perhaps even a litt le angry. However, he uses the phrase “And now for something completely different”  to change the topic of conversation, but also to perhaps make a little jok e.

This expression, “And now for something completely different,” was made famous by a group of comedians from Great Britain c alled Monty Python. Monty Python was a group of comedians back in the 1970s a nd ’80s, and one of the famous phrases in their show in order to move from one part of the show to another was, “And now for something completely diff erent.” It was always something very funny that followed. Here George is not saying anything funny, but he is using that expression as a way of changin g the topic.

He asks Lila a somewhat personal question: “How is your diet coming along?” A “diet” (diet) refers to the kind of food you eat. N ormally we use the word when someone is trying to lose weight. They’re trying to  eat certain kinds of food in order to not be as heavy as they are right now, to weigh less. George asks Lila how her diet “is coming along,” meaning is she bein g successful, is she losing any weight? Leila says, “I don’t really want to tal k about my weight.” Lila considers that a personal topic, just as George con siders his love life a personal topic.

That’s why George is asking the question. He’s tryi ng to get Lila to understand that this topic is personal and he doesn’t want to talk about it. But George then continues in order to get Lila perhaps a little ang ry and perhaps to get back at Lila – to do something bad to her because he feels she did something bad to him by continually asking questions about his love life . George says, “But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right?  I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.” “To shed (shed) pounds” means to lose weight.

Lila now is the one who tries to change the subject . She says, “Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want to talk about my diet.”  “Anyway” is a word that’s very popular in American English. You will hear it a lot  in daily conversation, and it is said usually to change the topic or to talk about s omething new. It’s important to listen to how the word is said. If it’s said at the  beginning of a sentence in the way that Lila says it, “Anyway . . .” (“Anyway . . .”),  usually that means the person wants to change the topic or is now going to talk a bout something different.

George says, “You need to cut out sweets if you wan t to lose weight.” “To cut out” something means to stop using it or stop doing  it – in this case, to stop eating it. That’s true, of course. If you want to l ose weight, it’s a good idea to cut out sweets, to cut out things with a lot of sugar i n them. George says, “Are you eating too many sweets?” “Sweets” refers to anythin g that has a lot of sugar, like candy.

Lila says, “That’s none of your business.” That exp ression, “That’s none of your business,” is used usually in anger when someone is  asking you about something that doesn’t concern them or that you thi nk is too personal to talk about. Lila is now angry at George, and George did this of course on purpose, trying to show Lila how her questions about his lov e life were also too personal to talk about. Lila says, “That’s none of your busines s.”

George says, “My sentiments exactly.” The expressio n “my sentiments (sentiments) exactly” is a phrase used to show that  you agree completely with the other person. You agree completely with what the other person has said.

 George agrees with Lila that asking about her weigh t is none of his business, because he wants Lila now to understand that asking  about his love life is none of her business.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
