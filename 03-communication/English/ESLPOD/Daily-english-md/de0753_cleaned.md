This episode is a conversation between Rafael and H annah about something called “hazing,” which is what happens you join an organization and are made to do certain things that may be humiliating or possib ly even dangerous.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Rafael:  Go away and stop following us.  Our club i s for boys only. 

Hannah:  But I want to join. 

Rafael:  You do, huh?  Did you know that to join ou r club, you have to go through an initiation? 

Hannah:  Okay, I’ll do that.  What do I have to do?  

Rafael:  You have to endure weeks of hazing.  We’ll  be putting you through your paces to make sure you’re club material.   

Hannah:  I’m willing to do that.  I can do anything  you boys can do.  Watch me! 

Rafael:  I’m not so sure.  If you want to be one of  the guys, you’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t wan t to. 

Hannah:  Everything? 

Rafael:  Yeah, everything.  If we tell you to eat d irt, you have to eat dirt.  If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do th at, too.  Get the picture?   

Hannah:  Yeah, I’ve got the picture. 

Rafael:  If we tell you to pull a prank, you have t o do it.  If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too. 

Hannah:  You can’t be serious.  That really crosses  the line.   

Rafael:  We decide what crosses the line and what d oesn’t.  See?  I knew you’d be too chicken to join our club. 

Hannah:  You’re right.  I don’t want to join any cl ub where the members are stupid enough to do all of those things.  I’m start ing my own club – one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in. 

Rafael:  Suit yourself.  I knew you weren’t club ma terial.   

Hannah:  Thank goodness for that!

Rafael begins our dialogue by saying to Hannah, “Go  away and stop following us (stop walking behind us or going where we’re going) .  Our club is for boys only.” So, Rafael and Hannah are children.  A “club” is an  organization, an association, a group of people interested in some topic.  We cal l the people in the group “members” of that club.  Sometimes the clubs are fo rmal, but sometimes we use the word informally.  We may have a “book club,” a group people who all read the same book and then come together and talk about it.   This is a club of the kind that young boys might have, and Rafael says that it ’s for boys only. 

Hannah says, “I want to join.”  I want to become a member.  Rafael says, “You do, huh (meaning oh, really)?  Did you know that to  join our club, you have to go through an initiation?”  An “initiation” (initiatio n) is some sort of series of actions, a “ceremony” or “ritual” we might call it, to bring  new members into a group.  It could just be the head of the group saying, “Welcom e, you are now members,” it could involve something else.  The new members may have to do something as part of their initiation.  “To initiate” also means , as a verb, to begin, so you can see the connection with the noun “initiation,” it’s  something that happens at the beginning of your membership in the club. 

Hannah says, “Okay, I’ll do that.  What do I have t o do?”  Rafael says, “You have to endure weeks of hazing.”  “To endure” (endure) m eans to experience something difficult, unpleasant, something that mig ht be uncomfortable, even  

painful for a long period of time.  “He endured a l ot of pain after he broke his leg.” He had to suffer through a lot of pain, to tolerate  a lot of pain.  Well, Rafael says that Hannah would have to endure weeks of hazing.  “Hazing” (hazing) is the process where some clubs or organizations make new members do silly, sometimes stupid, or even dangerous things in order  to become a member of the club.  This is most common at colleges and universi ties that have all-male or all- female organizations, what are called “fraternities ” and “sororities,” at least the ones that participate in this kind of hazing.  The colleges say they can’t do it; many students have actually died during these silly , rather stupid initiation rituals or initiation actions, but it continues to happen.  It seems like every year we read about some hazing incident or situation at a colleg e or university. 

Rafael says, “We’ll be putting you through your pac es to make sure you’re club material.”  “To put (someone) through their paces” (paces) means to test someone thoroughly and completely to make sure that  this person can do everything you want them to do.  Well, Rafael is go ing to try to put Hannah through her paces, to make her do all sorts things.   “To make sure,” he says, “that you are club material.”  “Material” here mean s good enough to meet the requirements of some job or position.  Sometimes wo men might say, “He’s not really very good boyfriend material” or “husband ma terial,” meaning he wouldn’t make a good boyfriend or a good husband.  That’s th e idea of “material” here. “Material” can also be the substance, what somethin g is made out of, especially clothing.  But here it means whether this person is  good enough for this position. 

Hannah says, “I’m willing to do that.  I can do any thing you boys can do.  Watch me!”  “Watch me” is a phrase we use to tell someone  to observe what I do because I’m going to do something unexpected or som ething you don’t think I can do.  For example, there are two men in a park a nd they see a beautiful woman, and one man says to the other, “You are too chicken to go over and talk to that beautiful woman.”  To say you’re “chicken” means you’re afraid, you’re scared, you’ll never go and it do.  And the other m an says, “Oh, you think I’m too scared?  I’m going to go get her telephone number s o I can call her and ask her out on a date.  Watch me!” meaning I’m going to do something you don’t think I can do.   

Rafael says, “I’m not so sure (I’m not so sure you,  Hannah, can do anything we boys can do).  If you want to be one of the guys, y ou’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t want to.”  “To be  one of the guys” is an expression meaning to be one of the group, especial ly a group of boys or young men.  It’s usually used to describe a girl or a wom an who is friends with a group of men, but not friendly in a romantic way, just fr iendly just like she were another  

man.  She may play sports with them or go drinking with them or whatever; that would be “one of the guys.”  That’s what Hannah wan ts to be. 

Hannah says, “Everything?”  I have to do everything  you tell me to do?  Rafael says, “Yeah (meaning yes), everything.  If we tell you to eat dirt (eat the black part of the earth, in essence), you have to eat dir t.  If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do that, too.  Get the pic ture?”  The expression “get the picture,” as a question, is to understand completel y what someone is talking about or what someone is asking.  You might also sa y, “Oh, I get the picture,” meaning yes, I understand everything you are talkin g about.  Sometimes we use that expression when you don’t actually give the ot her person all of the specific details – the specific information, but they are ab le to understand what you are really trying to say. 

Hannah says, “Yeah, I’ve got the picture.”  “Got” i s the past tense, of course, of “get.”  Rafael says, “If we tell you to pull a pran k, you have to do it.”  “To pull a prank” (prank) means to do something that tricks an other person into doing something that makes them look silly or foolish.  I t’s like a joke; we might call it a “practical joke,” a joke that involves some physica l action.  He says, “If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too.”  “To stre ak” (streak) means to take off all of your clothes and run quickly in public, in a par k or in a store, past everyone else without any clothes on – “naked,” we would say .  This was a strange thing that became popular in the 1970s, when I was growin g up.  I’m not sure, it might have been something people were smoking!  “Streak” has a number of different meanings however, not related to being naked.  You can find those in our Learning Guide. 

Hannah says to Rafael, “You can’t be serious.  That  really crosses the line.”  “To cross the line” means to go too far, to do somethin g that is too extreme, that is unacceptable.  Rafael says, “We decide what crosses  the line and what doesn’t. I knew you’d be too chicken (too scared) to join th e club.”  Hannah says, “You’re right.  I don’t want to join any club where the mem bers are stupid enough (are dumb enough) to do all of those things,” all of tho se things involved in the initiation – the hazing.  “I’m starting my own club ,” she says, “one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in.”  “To h umiliate yourself” means to embarrass yourself.  “To humiliate” (humiliate) is to do something silly or stupid that makes other people laugh at you or think somet hing bad about you.  “To get yourself in” or “to get in” means to be accepted by  a group or an organization. Hannah says she is going to have a club where you d on’t have to humiliate yourself to get into the club. 

Rafael says, “Suit yourself.”  “To suit (suit) your self” means to do whatever makes you happy.  The expression is usually used wh en someone doesn’t agree with the actions of another person.  The other pers on may refuse to do what the first person wants them to do or they may simply de cide to do something different, you say, “Well, suit yourself.”  It’s cr iticism; it’s saying you’re not doing what I want you to do but I don’t care, go ahead, d o it.  Rafael says, “I knew you weren’t club material.”  Hannah says, “Thank goodne ss for that!”  “Thank goodness” is a phrase we use to show gratitude or r elief, to say, “Oh, that’s a good thing.  Thank goodness.”   

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
