On this podcast, we are going to have a baby. Well,  not me. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Patrick: Hey, congratulations! I just heard that yo u're expecting. How far along are you?

Cindy: Thanks. I'm four and a half months pregnant.  It feels like it! I feel huge.

Patrick: You don't look it. I bet Carlos is excited . Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

Cindy: No, we don’t. Not yet. We should be able to find out at my next ultrasound. I don't care what sex the baby is as lo ng as it's healthy. Carlos is really excited about the baby. He has been going wi th me to every prenatal appointment and we'll be taking a Lamaze class toge ther soon.

Patrick: How was your first trimester? When my wife  had our daughter, she had a lot of morning sickness.

Cindy: Oh, it was horrible! I was nauseous all the time, but I'm better now. Did your wife have a natural delivery or a cesarean?

Patrick: She had a natural delivery, but she was in  labor for 12 hours! I was in the delivery room the entire time and wish I had an epi dural, too.

Cindy: Twelve hours! I can't imagine doing that.

Patrick: Don't think about it. I'm sure you'll have  an easy delivery. Let me know when the baby shower will be.

Cindy: Thanks. I will.

Well, in today’s podcast, we talk about someone hav ing a baby. Patrick talks to his friend Cindy and he says, “I just heard that yo u’re expecting.” “To be expecting,” for a woman, means that she is going to  have a baby, that she is pregnant. She is, we might say, “with child,” meani ng she has a child, or is going to have a baby. Now, this is a special verb “to be expecting.” It can also be used – that expression can also mean – just to be waitin g for something. “I am expecting a package from my brother.” But if we wan t to say someone is having a baby - and talking about a woman – then you can s ay “to be expecting.” It’s important to point out here that, although “to be e xpecting” comes from the verb “to expect,” you cannot say “She expects” – that do esn’t mean the same as she is expecting. You have to use “to be,” the verb “to  be” plus expecting to mean having a baby.

Well, the next question that Patrick asks Cindy is,  “How far along are you?” “How far along (along) are you? – that means how many mo nths pregnant are you. How soon will it be before you have your baby? – be fore you give birth, we would say. “To give birth” (birth) means to have a baby f or a woman. And Cindy says, “I’m four and a half months pregnant,” meaning she’ s been pregnant for four and a half months. So, the baby is four and a half mont hs in her – the expression we might use is “in her womb.” “Womb” (womb) is where the baby is before it is born.

Well, she is four and a half months pregnant and Pa trick says, “You don’t look it” and asks if they know if it’s going to be a boy or a girl. And Cindy says that they don’t know. They will be able to find out at her ne xt “ultrasound.” An “ultrasound” (ultrasound) is when the doctor is able to use a sp ecial machine and it’s sort of like taking a picture of the baby inside the womb. And you get to see the outline of the baby and, of course, if you see the baby in the picture and the baby is developed enough, you will tell whether it’s a boy or a girl. And if you don’t know how to tell a boy versus a girl, then this is not the podcast for you.

Now, Cindy says that her husband, Carlos, has been very supportive – has helped her – and he has gone to every prenatal appo intment. A “prenatal” – all one word – (prenatal) – means before the baby is bo rn. So, we talk about, for example, “prenatal medical care” – it means the med ical assistance, the medical care a woman gets before her baby is born.

Cindy also mentions that she and her husband are ta king a “Lamaze class” together. “Lamaze” – which is (Lamaze) – is a metho d where women – usually

they go to a class when they’re pregnant and they l earn how to breathe in a certain way, so when they are ready to give birth, to have their baby, the delivery is a little easier. And “Lamaze” was actually, I th ink, a French – the name of a French doctor from the 19th century – from the 1800 s. Well, Patrick says, “How was your first trimester?” Typically, a baby takes 9 months to be born and we divide those 9 months into 3 parts and we call each  part, a “trimester” –  “tri” (trimester). You might have heard the expression “s emester” (semester) – that’s when you divide something in two. A “trimester” is when you divide something in 3. So, the first trimester would be the first 3 mon ths of the pregnancy.

Patrick says that when he and his wife had their da ughter – well, the wife actually had the daughter, Patrick just watched, well, he he lped, of course. Well, his wife, Patrick’s wife, had “morning sickness.” Now, you kn ow what morning is and you know what sickness is, but when someone says “morni ng sickness” – this is what happens to some women when they are pregnant, espec ially during the first part of their pregnancy. When they wake up in the mornin g, they sometimes feel sick; although, I am told that some women are sick throug hout their nine months of their pregnancy or many months of their pregnancy. And that, of course, is not very fun, but it’s part of the body’s response to the pregnancy. And Cindy says that her morning sickness was horrible. She was “na useous” all the time. “To be nauseous” (nauseous) means to feel sick like you are going to well, the word we would use is “throw up” – two words – “throw up.” “ To throw up” means the same as to “vomit” (vomit) which means, what’s in your s tomach comes out your mouth. I know it’s not a very nice thing to talk ab out, but that’s what “to be nauseous” means, you feel like you’re going to thro w up.

“Did your wife have a natural delivery or a caesare an?” Cindy asks Patrick. “Did your wife have a natural delivery?” The delivery is  when the baby is born. The baby is “delivered” if you will. Well, a natural de livery means that the baby was born the regular – the normal way. The other possib ility is a caesarean. And “caesarean” spelled (caesarean) – we also sometimes  say a “caesarean section” (section) – two words – “caesarean section” means that the baby is removed – is taken out of the womb by cutting open a hole in the  womb and taking the baby out, rather than having it come out naturally. “Cae sarean” comes from – there’s an old story that Julius Caesar and Julius Caesar w as the first emperor of Rome, of ancient Rome 2000 years ago, that Julius Caesar was born this way. Although that’s almost certainly not a true story because his mother survived his childbirth, her childbirth rather, and that probably would not have happened if it had been a true caesarean section. But enough of history.

Patrick says, “She was in labor for 12 hours.” His wife was in “labor.” “To be in labor” – two words – (in labor) – means that you are preparing to have your baby

and it’s a time when the baby starts to come out of  the womb and it can last a few hours, it can last 10 hours, it can last a long  time. And it’s often the woman is in pain during that time. In fact, so much pain tha t sometimes the doctors give them a certain pain killer – a drug to lower the pa in, and that’s called an “epidural.” “Epidural” (epidural) is the way that they administer – they give you the drug – through an epidural. My mother had 11 ch ildren. I am the youngest, as some of you know. And I don’t think she had any epi durals back then.

Well, Patrick says that he wants to know when Cindy  and her husband are having the “baby shower.” A “baby shower” and “show er” (shower) – well “shower” normally means rain. But a “baby shower” is a party that you have usually before the baby is born and you go to the h ouse of the person who’s having the party and you give a gift to the mother and the father. Traditionally, only women go to baby showers, but in the last few years, several years really, in the last probably, 25, 30 years, it’s now more comm on for both men and women to go to this baby shower.

Well, now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at  a native rate of speech.
