This episode is called “Being in a Flood.”  A “floo d” is when there is too much water; the river has too much water and it goes bey ond the river.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cherise:  Well, that was a rude awakening at 2:00 in the morning!

Don:  At least we got out of our room before it flo oded.  It serves us right for planning a vacation here during the rainy season.  Our luggage is probably soaked.

Cherise:  Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clothes.  If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.

Don:  The sump pumps are working as we speak.  Hope fully, we can retrieve our stuff soon.

Cherise:  Maybe I should go downstairs and try to s alvage what I can, before things get washed away.

Don:  What?!  You could drown in all that water.  F orget it!

Cherise:  Drown in three feet of water?  Don’t be s illy.

Don:  I’ve seen you swim.  Come on, let’s just wait  until we get the go-ahead.

Cherise:  I still think I should try.

Don:  I have one word for you: snakes.

 Cherise:  Enough said!

Cherise begins by saying, “Well, that was a rude aw akening at 2:00 in the morning!”  “To be awakened” means to be woken up, s o an “awakening” is when you are sleeping and then you wake up.  A “rude awa kening” would be an awakening that was very sudden, because of a loud n oise perhaps.  Cherise says that she received a rude awakening at 2:00 in the morning – two a.m.

Don says, “At least we got out of our room before it flooded.”  “To flood” (flood), as a verb, is when a building or an area is suddenl y covered with water when it isn’t supposed to be.  So if a river, for example, has too much water, it may flood the areas around the river.  “To be flooded” is to be in the condition of having too much water.  Don says, “It serves us right for plan ning a vacation here during the rainy season.”  The expression “to serve (someone) right” means to get what you deserve, because of your own actions you should hav e expected something bad to happen.  So, someone is talking on a cell phone while driving a car and suddenly they aren’t paying attention and they hit another car, we might say, “Well, that serves them right.”  They should have k nown, but because of their own actions something bad happened to them – not to  mention the other car!

Well, Don and Cherise planned a vacation somewhere during the “rainy season,” the time of year when it rains a lot, which of cour se will be different in different places.  Los Angeles has something of a rainy seaso n in the winter and early spring, not very much however.  Don says that our “ luggage” – our baggage, the things we use to put our clothes in – he says, “Our  luggage is probably soaked.” “To be soaked” (soaked) is to be very wet.  We migh t also use the term “drenched” (drenched); it’s completely full of wate r.  If you walk out into the rain, and you have your clothing on, you will probably ge t soaked; your clothes will all be very wet.  That’s what Don is talking about; he says, “Our luggage is probably soaked.”

Cherise says, “Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clot hes (our clothing).  If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.”  “To recede” (recede) means for something to go back, to move ba ckwards.  If the water receded, the water will go back to where it belongs .  So if a river floods, and then the water recedes, the water goes away from the pla ces where it shouldn’t have been back into the river.  You can talk about someo ne’s hairline receding, especially a man.  Your “hairline” is where you sti ll have hair on your head; the line, if you will, that separates the hair from the  skin, the part of your head that

doesn’t have hair.  If you have a receding hairline  that means you’re losing your hair; you have less and less of it every year.  Tho ugh, they say men with receding hairlines are more intelligent than other men – I’m not really sure!

Cherise is worried that the clothes will have mold and mildew on them.  “Mold” (mold) are actually very small plants that grow on objects that are a little bit wet – we would say “damp” (damp) – often food or some obj ects.  They are green and black typically in color; sometimes mold will have a certain unpleasant smell. Mold, especially on things in your house, is almost  always a bad thing.  “Mildew” (mildew) are also very small plants, like mold.  Us ually they’re either white or green; they’re very similar to mold.  Normally we a ssociate mildew with clothing. So, if clothing gets wet and then it stays that way  for a long time – it’s in a closet or some other place that’s damp, that’s slightly we t – it may become mildewed and you can’t really wear it anymore, it has a cert ain smell to it that you don’t want to have on your body.

Don says that the sump pumps are working as we spea k.  A “sump (sump) pump (pump)” is a special machine that is used to remove  water, for example, from the bottom of a building or a house, from the “basement ,” the floor below the ground. If you get a lot of water in your house you may nee d one of these sump pumps to get rid of the water.  Don says, “The sump pumps are working as we speak.” The expression “as we speak” means right now, at th is very moment.  Don says, “Hopefully (we hope), we can retrieve our stuff soo n.”  “To retrieve” (retrieve) means to go somewhere and get something and bring it back.  “I left my wallet on my desk at work.  I need to go back and retrieve it .”  To get it back, to bring it back to where I am now.

Cherise says, “Maybe I should go downstairs and try  to salvage what I can, before things get washed away.”  “To salvage” (salv age) means to save what can be saved from a group of things that otherwise are being destroyed or will be destroyed soon because of rain, or floods, or whate ver.  I’m going to try to salvage, I’m going to try to take what I can save a nd get rid of the rest.  Cherise wants to salvage their luggage “before things get w ashed away.”  “Washed away” would mean taken away by the water, the water  that is part of the flood in this case.

Don says, “What?!  You could drown in all of that w ater.”  “To drown” (drown) means to die while you are underwater.  The water f ills up your lungs, you cannot breathe, and so you die.  That is “to drown.”  Don says, “Forget it!”  Cherise says, “Drown in three feet of water?  Don’t be silly.”  S he’s saying that the water is only three feet high and therefore she won’t drown, so s he’s telling Don that he is wrong.  She says, “Don’t be silly.”  Don says, “I’v e seen you swim.  Come on,

let’s just wait until we get the go-ahead.”  The “g o-ahead” is a way of saying approval, when someone in authority says, “yes, you  can do that.”  Don is waiting for the authorities to say it’s okay for them to go  back downstairs and look at their stuff – try to salvage their stuff.

But Cherise wants to go; she says, “I still think I  should try.”  Don says, “I have one word for you: snakes.”  A “snake” (snake) is a long animal that doesn’t have any legs; it moves around on the ground.  It can so metimes bite you, and it has, sometimes, poison that can kill you.  Don uses an e xpression we sometimes use in English for emphasis; to get someone’s attention  we say, “I have one word for you,” and that one word will explain everything.  in this case, the word is “snakes.”  Obviously Cherise is scared or frightene d of snakes.  She responds by saying, “Enough said!”  The phrase “enough said” sh ows that you have heard what the person has said, and you agree or understa nd it completely so the other person doesn’t have to say any more.  I get it; I u nderstand, there are snakes downstairs.  Why?  I…I’m not really sure, but there  are snakes downstairs and I don’t like snakes, therefore I am not going downsta irs.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
