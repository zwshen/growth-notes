[start of dialogue]

Yousef:  Why are you rearranging the furniture?

Rachel:  My Aunt Susan called and she’s coming for a visit.  It’ll be so nice to see her.  It’s been a while since we’ve had a housegues t.

Yousef:  Your crazy Aunt Susan?  The one who talks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?

Rachel:  Don’t be like that.  She’s a little eccent ric, but she has a heart of gold.

Yousef:  How long is she staying?

Rachel:  She was a little vague about that.  We’ll just play it by ear.

Yousef:  I don’t like the sound of that.  Open-ende d invitations are a bad idea.

Rachel:  She won’t outstay her welcome.  As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she wants.  You don’t mind, do you?

Yousef:  Speak for yourself.  I don’t like having h ouseguests.  They hog the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear.  I feel restricted.

Rachel:  That’s a small price to pay for her intere sting company, don’t you think? We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.

Yousef:  I think you’re making some unwarranted ass umptions here.  First, you assume that I enjoy her company.  Second, you assum e that I’ll be here.

Rachel:  What do you mean?  You won’t be here next week?

Yousef:  Next week, I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto.  Didn’t I already mention it?

Our dialogue begins when Yousef says to Rachel, “Wh y are you rearranging the furniture?”  “To rearrange” means to change the pos ition of different objects; we especially use this verb with furniture: coaches, c hairs, desks, sofas, that sort of thing.  To rearrange them means to put them in diff erent places in the room.

Rachel says, “My Aunt Susan (you could also say ‘My  Aunt Susan,’ either pronunciation is correct) called and she’s coming f or a visit.  It’ll be so nice to see her.  It’s been a while since we’ve had a housegues t.”  A “houseguest” is a person who stays in your home for a certain amount of time, usually a friend or a family member.

Yousef says, “Your crazy Aunt Susan?  The one who t alks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?”  “To talk to yourself” is to speak quietly to yourself without expecting anyone to be listening or anyone to answer you.  Sometimes that’s considered a sign of a crazy person, a perso n who is mentally ill; they talk to themselves, when, in truth, almost everyone talk s to themselves.  I talk to myself.  We don’t tell other people we talk to ours elves, but it’s part of the thinking process I think.  We all do it.

Anyway, Yousef thinks that the aunt is crazy.  Rach el says, “Don’t be like that.” The expression “don’t be like that” is used when yo u are asking someone to stop behaving in a certain way; you are not happy with t he way they are talking or acting.  Rachel says her aunt is a little eccentric .  “Eccentric” (eccentric) means a little unusual, something that is a little strange,  not normal.  It’s not a sign of being crazy.  It’s a way that we may describe someo ne who acts very differently, not the way other people act in that society, but t hey’re not mentally ill, we might just say they’re eccentric.  This aunt of Rachel’s is eccentric, but she has a heart of gold.  To say someone “has a heart of gold” is t o mean they’re very nice; they’re very friendly; they’re good people.

 Yousef says, “How long is she staying?”  How long w ill she be at our house? Rachel says, “She was a little vague about that.”  “To be vague” (vague) means that you aren’t very clear; you aren’t very precise .  “What time are you going to be at the party?”  “Oh, maybe two, three, possibly four.”  You’re being very vague; you’re not giving a direct, specific answer.   Rachel says, “We’ll just play it by ear.”  That’s a popular expression.  “To play it  by ear” means to do what feels right at the moment.  You don’t have a plan, you’re  just going to sort of make up your plan as you go along, so it may change every h our; you may decide to do something different.  You’re playing it by ear; you ’re not making a plan.  It probably comes from music, where you hear a song, a nd you don’t have what we would call the “sheet music,” a piece of paper with  the notes written on it, so you have to play it just by listening to it.  I’m guess ing that’s where it comes from, but what do I know?  I’m not a musician.  I can’t sing,  anyway!

Yousef says, “I don’t like the sound of that.  Open -ended invitations are a bad idea.”  “Open-ended” means there isn’t a clear end or, in this case, a clear answer.  You don’t know when something is going to end.  If you have an open- ended commitment to someone it could last a week, i t could last a year, you don’t know.  Yousef says that open-ended invitations are a bad idea, saying to someone, “Yes, come and stay at my house however lo ng you want,” not giving them a definite time.

Rachel says, “She won’t outstay her welcome.”  “To outstay” (outstay – one word) means to stay in someone’s home or office lon ger than that person wants you to.  You think they’re going to be there for 2 days, and instead they’re there for 20 days.  That would be outstaying your welcome .  Rachel says, “As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she want s to.  You don’t mind, do you?”  Of course, Yousef does mind; he is bothered by that.  He says, “Speak for yourself.”  We use that phrase to show that our opi nion is not the same as the opinion the person we’re talking to is expressing.  So, Rachel is saying she can stay however long she wants.  Yousef doesn’t agree;  he says, “Speak for yourself.  I don’t like having houseguests.  They h og the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear.  I feel restricte d.”  “To hog (hog) (something),” as a verb, means to use it so that no  one else can use it, to use it longer than you should.  “To hog the TV” would be t o watch what you want to watch on TV, and not let anyone else use the televi sion to watch what they want. “Hog” has a couple of different meanings in English ; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Yousef is complaining that he won’t be able to walk  around the house in his underwear, which many people do.  He says, “I feel restricted.”  “To be restricted”

means to be unable to move freely, to be limited.  Rachel says, “That’s a small price to pay for her interesting company, don’t you  think?”  “A small price to pay” says that yes, something is going to be a little pa inful, a little unpleasant, but you’re going to get a lot back in return.  So you m ight say, “Not smoking every day is a small price to pay for living a longer lif e.”  It isn’t going to be that painful and you get a lot of benefit if you do it.  Rachel thinks that her aunt is interesting company.  “Company” can mean a business, but “compa ny” can also mean the presence of another person, someone else in the sam e room or with you somewhere.  “I’m going to keep (someone) company” i s a common expression; I’m going to go and be there with them, talk to the m, make sure they’re not alone. That’s the use of “company” that Rachel is employin g here.  She says, “We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.”

Yousef says, “I think you’re making some unwarrante d assumptions.”  An “assumption” is something that you believe to be tr ue, but it may be wrong.  You don’t necessarily have all of the information neces sary.  “Unwarranted” means not warranted; “warranted” means justified, with a good reason.  “Unwarranted” means not justified.  You don’t have a good reason to make that assumption Yousef is saying.  “First,” he says, “you assume th at I enjoy her company. Second, you assume that I’ll be here.”  Rachel says , “What do you mean?  You won’t be here next week?”  Yousef says, “Next week,  I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto.  Didn’t I already mention that?”  Of cours e, Yousef has decided to visit his brother because Rachel’s Aunt Susan is coming t o their house.  He, of course, wasn’t planning this when they started the conversation, but that’s how he’s going to get away from having to be in the hou se with Rachel’s aunt.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
