<h1>Problem H - Beacons</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>

<p>
In ancient times, communication was not as swift as it is today. When
a kingdom was at war, it could take months to muster all the armed
forces. But by using fire-lit beacons at strategic locations, it was
still possible to quickly send emergency signals.

<p>
When the first beacon is lit, all other beacons within sight from it
are also lit. All beacons within sight of these are then lit, and so
on until all beacons are lit - assuming of course that all beacons are
within sight of each other, directly or indirectly. If they are not,
the dire news must be carried by riders between some beacons.

<p>
Given the location of all beacons in the kingdom as well as the
location and size of all mountain peaks, write a program that
determines how many messages must be sent by riders in order for all
beacons to be lit when an enemy threatens the country.

<p>
For simplicity, we model the country in the following way: a beacon is
represented as a point in the xy-plane and a mountain peak is
represented as a circle. Two beacons are considered to be within sight
of each other if no mountain peak blocks the straight line between the
two beacons.

<p>
<i>The input will be constructed so that the straight line between any
pair of beacons will not touch the circumference of a mountain peak,
unless it passes through the interior of another mountain
peak. Mountain peaks will not overlap or touch, nor will any beacon be
on a mountain peak or on its circumference.</i>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<25) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line of input for each test case contains two integers <i>n</i> (<i>1 &le;
n &le; 1000</i>) and <i>m</i> (<i>0 &le; m &le; 1000</i>) the number
of beacons and the number of mountain peaks, respectively.  Then
follow <i>n</i> lines specifying the locations of the beacons. The
location of each beacon is given as a pair of integers <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> (<i>0 &le; x, y &le; 10000</i>). Then follow <i>m</i>
lines describing the mountain peaks. Each mountain peak is given as a
pair of integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> x(<i>0 &le; x, y &le;
10000</i>) specifying the location of the peak and a radius <i>r</i>
(<i>1 &le; r &le; 5000</i>).

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case the output should be a line containing a single integer: the number of messages that
must be carried by riders for all beacons to be lit.
