Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 49: Using a Camera.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 549.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Using a Camera.”  It’s a dialogue  between Ingrid and Deng using vocabulary common to discussions related to camer as.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ingrid:  I don’t mind lending you my camera for the tr ip, but first, let me show you how to use it.

Deng:  No need to do that.  I took a photography class i n high school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.

Ingrid:  Wasn’t that a long time ago?  This is a digit al camera with some new features.  For instance, this camera has auto zoom, image  stabilization, and a memory card.

Deng:  It can’t be that different from the camera I u sed 15 years ago.  This looks like a point-and-shoot.  You look through the viewer a nd push the button, right?

Ingrid:  Well, not quite.  You can adjust the flash an d shutter speed, see?  You can also attach a lens for wide-angle or close-up shots.  You can even review your photos, saving the ones you like or deleting the ones you don’t want anymore.

Deng:  Okay, I got it.  By the way you’re talking, you’d t hink I was born yesterday. Just show me where to load the film!

Ingrid says to Deng, “I don’t mind lending you my camera  for your trip, but first, let me show you how to use it.”  A “camera,” as you prob ably know, is a device that you use to take photographs.  Ingrid is going to “lend,” let Deng use, her camera for his trip.  Deng says, “No need to do that (me aning you don’t need to show me how to use it).  I took a photography class in hig h school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.”  “P hotography” is – I guess we could call it the art and science of taking good phot ographs (good pictures). Deng says he’s an expert.  He says, “I pretty much (meaning I almost know) all there is to know (everything) about taking pictures.”  “Pi ctures” is just another word we use for photographs.

Ingrid says, “Wasn’t that a long time ago?  This is a dig ital camera with some new features.”  Up until recently, when for example I w as growing up, cameras had “film,” which is pieces of plastic, basically, that ha ve special chemicals on them.  When you expose those chemicals to light and then later put them in other chemicals, you ended up with a photograph.  Nowadays many cameras are digital, so there is no film; everything is stored electr onically on a small memory stick or memory chip that is inside the camera or connected t o the camera.

Ingrid says, “For instance (for example), this camera has a uto zoom, image stabilization, and a memory card.”  “Auto” is short for  automatic, something that happens without you needing to do anything.  “Zoom” (z oom), when we’re talking about a camera, is the ability to change the view so tha t something that is far away seems very close.  “Auto zoom” would be the ability for  the camera to automatically “detect,” or automatically know how far some thing is and zoom in on it so you could get a better, closer picture of it.  “Image stabilization” is a feature on some cameras that allows the camera to keep the image (what you are taking a picture of) “in focus,” meaning very clear, e ven though your hand is moving.  “Memory cards” are small, usually square or rectang ular pieces of electronic equipment that are used to store data.  It’ s like a DVD or a CD can be used to store movies and photographs and other documents.  Memory cards in a camera are used to “store,” or used to keep, the digita l images – the photographs.  If you want to take even more photograph s, you can put in a different memory card with more memory.

Deng says, “It can’t be that different from the camera I  used 15 years ago.  This looks like a point-and-shoot.”  The phrase “point-and-sho ot” means that it’s a

 very simple camera where you just hold up the camera, put it in the direction of the thing you want to take a photograph of, and push o r press a button that then takes the photograph.  There’s no adjustments that you ha ve to make before you take the photo.  It’s a very simple kind of camera for dum b people like me, who don’t know how to use cameras very well.  But I did take a photography class in high school!  Deng says, “You look through the viewer and push the button, right?”  The “viewer” is the small, rectangular openin g in the back of the camera that you look through to see what you are going to take  a picture of – to see the image of that you are going to take the photograph of .  That’s a viewer.  “Viewer” has a couple of other meanings however, so take a look at  the Learning Guide for those.

Ingrid says, “Well, not quite.  You can adjust the flash and shutter speed, see?” She’s showing him.  The “flash” is the bright light tha t lasts for a very short period of time that gives you more light so that you can see wha t is in front of you; it will appear better on the photograph.  That’s a flash.  “S hutter speed” is the amount of time that the small window inside of the camera is open.  A slow shutter speed means that you need more light; a fast shutter speed me ans you need less light. So if you’re out in the sun and it’s very bright out, yo u would not need a slow shutter speed.  “Shutter” is just the name of the littl e window that opens and closes rapidly that exposes the film in an old camera – the electronic sensing equipment inside the camera, what the camera uses to con vert that light into a digital image.

Ingrid says, “You can also attach a lens for wide-angle o r close-up shots.” “Wide-angle” means that it is a “lens,” something that  you put on the front of the camera, that creates photographs with a wider than no rmal view.  A “close-up” is when you want to be very close or near to something, when  there is very little distance between the camera and what you are taking a pi cture of.  You could take a close-up of someone’s face, for example.  Ingrid sa ys, “You can even review your photos (look at your photos after you’ve taking them), saving the ones you like or deleting the ones you don’t want anymore .”  So the camera has sort of a little computer that allows you to see the pho tographs on the back and delete the ones you don’t want.

Deng says, “Okay, I got it (meaning I understand).  By the way you’re talking, you’d think I was born yesterday.”  “By the way you’re talki ng” means the way that you are talking to me indicates that you “think I w as born yesterday.”  The expression “born yesterday” means that someone is inexperience d, someone who is naïve, someone who is easily tricked or lied to.  Y ou may say, “Of course I

 know how to use a fax machine.  I wasn’t born yesterday!”  Someone who would be born yesterday would, of course, be a very small baby wh o wouldn’t know anything.  But you have experience, you do know something , and therefore you weren’t born yesterday.  Deng says, “Just show me where to load the film!”  “To load” means to put something into something else, especia lly when it is needed to make it work.  So if you have a copier (a copy machine) , you need to load paper into it; you need to put paper into the machine  so that you can make your copies.  “Film,” we already mentioned, is a long, thin piece of plastic used in older cameras to record the image – to capture the image, t he light that comes in.  The question indicates, of course, that Deng really doesn’t kn ow what he’s talking about, since digital cameras don’t have film!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
