On this episode, we have a dialogue between Charlot te and Mohamed about making a certain kind of food: soup, and a thick ki nd of soup called a stew. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Charlotte: Mmm, something smells good.

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!

Charlotte: Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.

Mohamed: I’m making chicken soup.

Charlotte: I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew . There’s nothing more appetizing on a cold day than a good stew.

Mohamed: Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup  with a clear stock and vegetables.

Charlotte: All you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.

Mohamed: I get it. You’re partial to thick soups, b ut I feel like making a simple chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a  slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée o r bisque would be nice too. Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could rea lly go for a nice bowl of chowder.

Mohamed: Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorr ow.

Charlotte: Really?

Mohamed: Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a can.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Charlotte saying to Moha med, “Mmm, something smells good.” “Mmm” is a sound that we make sometim es in English for something that looks good or, usually, smells and o r tastes good. When you see someone preparing food or you smell good food, you might go “Mmm, that smells delicious” – that smells like something I would rea lly want to eat. You would never do that, for example, in my kitchen when I’m cooking.

Mohamed isn’t very happy with Charlotte. Charlotte seems to be in Mohamed’s kitchen, because we hear him respond to Charlotte b y saying, “Hey, put down that lid!” A “lid” (lid) is the top of a pot or pan  that you use for cooking. “To put something down” means to put it back down where it was. So we can guess that Charlotte has taken the top or the lid off of the p an where Mohamed is looking something in order to smell it or to taste it. Char lotte says, “Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.” Charlotte wanted to see wh at Mohamed was cooking.

Mohamed says, “I’m making chicken soup.” “Soup” (so up), as you probably know, is a food that has some sort of sauce or liqu id as the base or as the main ingredient – the main part of the food. Usually you  put things into soup like noodles or, in this case, chicken. Soup is almost a lways eaten with a spoon, at least in the United States. There are some soups th at you might drink and eat without a spoon. You might just lift the bowl up an d drink it, but usually you eat soup with a spoon.

Charlotte says, “I’m really in the mood for a heart y stew.” A “stew” (stew) is a special kind of soup that’s very thick. It has typi cally a lot of meat and/or vegetables in it. Usually it takes a long time to p repare a stew. The adjective “hearty” (hearty), when used with food, describes s omething that is very thick, filling, and satisfying. Something that is hearty i s usually something that, after you eat it, you won’t feel hungry again for a long time .

 Charlotte says, “There’s nothing more appetizing on  a cold day than a good stew.” When we describe food as “appetizing” (appet izing), we mean it’s appealing. It makes you want to eat it. Mohamed say s, “Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup with a clear stock and vegetabl es.” Mohamed is saying that he’s not making a stew. He instead is making “a sim ple chicken soup with a clear stock.”

“Stock” (stock) has a couple of different meanings in English. Here, when we’re talking about food, it means a clear liquid that is  made usually by boiling meat, vegetables, and perhaps a few other ingredients. Yo u could have a chicken stock, which would be liquid that comes from puttin g a big chicken (or a little chicken) into a pot of boiling water. You get rid o f the chicken, and what you have left is this liquid that has a chicken taste. We wo uld call that “chicken stock.”

You can do the same thing with other kinds of meat,  with fish or with vegetables, or some combination of those things. The idea of a stock is that it doesn’t have anything hard or solid in it; it’s just the liquid.  Mohamed is using a “clear (clear) stock.” A clear stock would be a stock that doesn’t  have a lot of color. “Chicken stock” is usually a clear stock. Charlotte says, “A ll you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer.  Then, presto! You have a stew.”

Charlotte is suggesting to Mohamed how he could cha nge his soup, his clear stock soup, into a stew. She says, “All you would h ave to do is thicken the soup.” “To thicken” (thicken) food means, not surprisingly , to make something thicker, especially by adding either flour or another ingred ient called cornstarch. You can thicken soups in a number of different ways. You ca n even use egg yolk – the inside of an egg, a raw egg, uncooked egg – to chic ken soup, or at least that’s what I read in a cookbook once.

“To simmer” (simmer) means to boil something at a v ery low heat. The water or the liquid in the pan is boiling, but it isn’t boil ing very rapidly. We would say it’s not a “full boil.” It is bubbling. You can see the bubbles on the top of the surface, but it’s all being done at a very low heat. Charlot te explains that stews are typically prepared, or made, by simmering the liqui d for a long time.

She says, “Then, presto! You have a stew.” “Presto”  (presto) is a word we use to indicate that something has happened very quickly, even magically. “Presto” comes from the Italian, meaning quick or fast or ra pid. We sometimes use that term in music, when talking about music that goes q uickly or rapidly – but more generally, the word is used to describe something t hat happens very quickly, and that’s what Charlotte is using the word here to mea n.

 Mohamed says, “I get it,” meaning yes, I understand . “You’re partial,” he says, “to thick soups.” “To be partial (partial) to” somethin g means to prefer something. Some men are partial to blondes – they like women w ho have blonde hair. Some people are partial to brunettes – women who have da rk or brown hair. Some people are partial to beer; if they want to drink s omething with alcohol in it, they drink beer. Some people are partial to wine – they have a preference for wine, and so forth. Charlotte is partial to stews, to thi ck soups.

Mohamed says, however, “I feel like making a simple  chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.” A “slow cooker” is a special kind of cooking machin e, an electric machine that cooks food very slowly for many hours at a time. A more common term for a slow cooker is a “crock (crock) pot.”

Many people have crock pots that they use to cook f ood for a very long period of time. Some people put food into the crock pot in the morning before they go to work, and when they come home later in the day, the  food is done. It’s been cooking slowly the whole day. That particular kind of cooking machine is called a “slow cooker” or a “crock pot.”

Mohamed usually makes stews in a crock pot, he says , not in a pot. A “pot” (pot) here refers to a metal container, something you coo k with that is put on top of some source of heat, usually a stove, and is used t o cook things like soup. “Pot” has a number of different meanings in English. “Pot ” can also refer to marijuana, that you smoke. You have to be very careful which k ind of pot you use in the kitchen. Do you want to prepare some food, or do yo u want something else to happen?

Charlotte says, “All right, all right.” She is sayi ng that yes, she understands that Mohamed doesn’t want to make her stew. She then say s, “Oh, a nice purée or bisque would be nice too.” A “purée” (purée) is a s mooth and creamy soup or other kind of food that is made by putting food usu ally into a special machine called a “blender” (blender). You might make a vege table purée, when you take vegetables and you chop them up into very small pie ces by putting them in this special kind of machine that chops up and blends fo od, called a “blender.”

Charlotte says, “Oh, I would also like soup that is  a purée or a bisque” (bisque). A “bisque” is a creamy, thick soup. We often make lob ster bisque, which is a thick soup made with the meat of a lobster. Charlotte say s, “Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now?” A “chowder” (chowder) is another k ind of thick soup, a stew that

is usually made with seafood, potatoes, milk, and/o r cream. A very common kind of chowder in the U.S. is “clam (clam) chowder.” A “clam” is a kind of shellfish.

Charlotte says, “I could really go for a nice bowl of chowder.” “To go for” something means to really want to do something or t o have something. When we’re talking about food, it’s something that you w ould really want to eat. “I could go for a nice big doughnut” – I feel like eating a nice big doughnut. I always feel like eating a nice big doughnut, but if I ate dough nuts every time I felt like eating doughnuts, I would be 500 pounds and not very healt hy.

Anyway, Mohamed says, “Fine, we’ll have chowder for  dinner tomorrow.” He’s telling Charlotte that he will make a thick soup, a  chowder, for her – not today, but tomorrow. Charlotte says, “Really?” Mohamed say s, “Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a ca n. Mohamed is saying yes, we’ll have chowder tomorrow, but I’m not going to m ake the chowder – I’m going to just buy a can of soup prepared already from the  store and give you that.

Of course, soup from a can never as good – almost n ever – as soup from your own kitchen, soup that you prepare. Mohamed is not saying that he’s going to cook Charlotte some chowder. He instead is saying h e’s just going to buy a can of chowder and give her that – which is not very ni ce, Mohamed, really. But then again, if Charlotte really wants chowder, she can l earn how to cook herself and make her own soup.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée o r bisque would be nice too. Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could rea lly go for a nice bowl of chowder.
