The episode today is about kitchen appliances.  “Ap pliances” are the machines that you may have in your house that do certain thi ngs, and we’ll find out what those things are in this episode.  The dialogue is between Victoria and Justin, although those aren’t their real names.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victoria:  As you can see, this executive apartment  is fully equipped.  When you called and asked for the best available apartment, I thought of this one immediately.  Just look at this kitchen!  All of the appliances are top of the line.

Justin:  Do you mind if I take a closer look?  I li ke to cook.

Victoria:  No problem.  The refrigerator has a high  capacity, with the freezer on the bottom.

Justin:  But there’s no ice maker.

Victoria:  No, that’s one of the few things it does n’t have.

Justin:  Hmm…Is this range gas or electric?

Victoria:  It’s gas, and it has a broiler on the bo ttom, see?

Justin:  Is the stove self-cleaning?

Victoria:  I’m afraid not, but it’s stainless steel , as you can see.

Justin:  That’s too bad.  Is the dishwasher new?

Victoria:  It’s not brand new, but it’s in very goo d condition.  The microwave, toaster, and coffee maker also come with the apartm ent.  What do you think?  Do you think it’ll suit your needs?

Justin:  When I asked for your best, I expected the  Cadillac of apartments. You’ve shown me a Pinto!

Victoria begins by saying, “As you can see, this ex ecutive apartment is fully equipped.”  When we say something is “an executive apartment,” we’re referring to an apartment for someone important, someone who would be a leader or a manager in a company – that’s what an “executive” i s – usually a large company or organization.  Victoria seems to be showing Just in this apartment.  Maybe she’s the owner; maybe she’s just a “real estate ag ent,” someone who shows you different properties you may want to rent or bu y.  Victoria says that this executive apartment is fully equipped.  “To be equi pped” (equipped) means to have certain equipment or certain features.  “To be  fully equipped” means to be completely equipped; it has all the equipment that you would want.  She says, “When you called and asked for the best available a partment, I thought of this one immediately.  Just look at the kitchen!”  The u se of the word “just” here is just for emphasis.  “Look at the kitchen.”  “Just look a t the kitchen!”  They mean the same, but “just” adds a little bit more emphasis to  the statement, a little bit more power.  She says, “All of the appliances are top of  the line.”  An “appliance” is a piece of equipment that you use in your home, espec ially in the kitchen.  Victoria says these are top of the line.  The expression “to p of the line” means to be the best type of something, the highest quality, and so metimes – often – the most expensive.

Justin says, “Do you mind (is it okay) if I take a closer look?”  “To take a closer look” means to inspect or examine or look at someth ing very carefully.  You want to make sure it is what they say it is.  Justin say s, “I like to cook.”  Victoria says, “No problem.  The refrigerator has a high capacity. ”  A “refrigerator,” sometimes called simply the “fridge,” when I was growing up it was called in my house the “icebox.”  An “icebox” is an old style of refrigera tor before there was electricity. Now, we had electricity in Minnesota in the 1960s.  However, that’s what my parents called it, perhaps from their own childhood , and so that’s what we called it.  The refrigerator was called the “icebox.”  Ice , of course, was put in to keep things cold when you didn’t have a motor inside to make the air cold.

Well, Victoria says that the refrigerator in this a partment is high capacity. “Capacity” is the amount of something that you can put in a certain place, the

amount of space.  “High capacity” would mean I thin k the same as “large capacity,” meaning it’s a big refrigerator.  “With a freezer on the bottom,” she adds.  A “freezer” (freezer) is a large appliance t hat keeps food frozen.  In a refrigerator, the temperature is probably going to be around 40 degrees – 38 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit.  In a freezer it’s going to be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit so things freeze; they become solid.  Water becomes  solid below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  Well, that’s what a “freezer” is; it f reezes things.  Most people have a combination refrigerator-freezer, with the freezer on the top or the bottom and refrigerator on – well, where the freezer is not.  In my house growing up we had a separate freezer and a separate refrigerator becaus e, well, we needed a lot of food to feed all of the people in my family.

Justin says, “But there’s no ice maker.”  An “ice m aker” is a part of the freezer that some freezers have – not all of them do – that  makes ice cubes for you.  So, you don’t have to put water into a little what we w ould call an “ice cube tray” in order to have ice cubes, it will make them for you automatically.  I always thought that ice makers were for people who were kind of la zy.  I mean, how difficult is it to put the water into a little container?  The prob lem is people forget, of course.  I have a new freezer that has an ice maker and I love  it, so I understand now why people like ice makers.  I keep talking about mysel f.  Do you notice that?  I don’t know why that is.  Let’s get back to our dialogue.

Justin says, “there’s no ice maker.”  Victoria resp onds, “No, that’s one of the few things it doesn’t have (it does not have).”  Justin  says, “Hmm…Is this range gas or electric?”  A “range” (range) in this dialogue m eans a large surface in a kitchen that has several places to cook things.  It has sev eral burners that have fire or flame or heat that you can cook food with.  You put  a “pan,” a large metal object that’s flat or rounded – slightly rounded; you can cook things like eggs or hamburgers on a range.  It’s usually on the top of what’s called a “stove” (stove), which is a combination of a range and an oven.  An “oven” is a box that you heat basically, and it cooks food, things like cakes.  O r, if you were going to prepare and cook a turkey, you would put it in an oven.  It ’s a big box that gets very hot, and you close the door, and it cooks the food.  Tha t’s an “oven.”  A range is on the top, where you cook food in pans.  The combinat ion is called a “stove,” where you have a range and an oven.

Most houses in cities – large cities have gas at the house, and these ranges – the ovens, the stoves – they’re all powered by gas.   However, there are some places that do not have gas, newer cities.  For exa mple, when I was living in Arizona for a while they had electric appliances, s o there was no gas line that went to the house.

Justin asks if this range is gas or electric.  Vict oria says, “It’s gas, and it has a broiler on the bottom, see?”  Some stoves in additi on to having an oven and a range have something underneath the oven called a “ broiler.”  It’s a place where the heat becomes more intense more quickly.  If you  are going to cook some steaks you may want to broil them, put them in this  very hot oven underneath the main oven, typically.  Usually the fire is closer t o the food and therefore cooks it more quickly as well as gives you a certain brownne ss on the food, if that’s what you want.  Well, Justin asks if the stove self-clea ning.  Victoria says, “I’m afraid not (which is a polite way of saying no), but it’s stainless steel, as you can see.” “Stainless steel” is a silver-colored metal that do esn’t rust, and it’s very popular in modern kitchens.

The stove is stainless steel, but it’s not self-cle aning.  Justin says, “That’s too bad.  Is the dishwasher new?”  A “dishwasher” (one word) is a large machine that washes dishes.  That seems pretty obvious!  A dishw asher could be a human being if you don’t have a machine; I am the dishwas her in my household. Victoria says, “It’s not brand new (meaning the dis hwasher isn’t new out of the store), but it’s in very good condition.  The micro wave, toaster, and coffee maker also come with the apartment (are included in the r ent of the apartment).”  A “microwave” is a special kind of oven that uses ele ctric waves to cook or heat food quickly.  A “toaster” (toaster) makes “toast,”  which is bread that is browned when it is cooked.  There are some other meanings of “toast” and “toaster,” as well as the word “range” that we used earlier.  Tho se can be found in the Learning Guide for this episode.

The apartment also comes with a “coffee maker.”  Ag ain, obviously, something that makes coffee, a small machine – a small kitche n appliance.  Victoria asks Justin, “What do you think?  Do you think it’ll sui t your needs?” and Justin says, “When I asked for your best (your best apartment), I expected the Cadillac of apartments.”  The expression “the Cadillac of” mean s the very best of something. In the United States, a Cadillac at least used to b e considered one of the best cars; only very rich people drove Cadillacs.  That’ s not true anymore; it’s not one of the best cars in most places, but we still have that expression: “the Cadillac of podcasters,” “the Cadillac of laptops,” “the Cadill ac of coffee cups,” whatever. Well, Justin wanted the best, “the Cadillac of apar tments.”  Instead, he says, Victoria has shown him a Pinto.  A “Pinto” is anoth er kind of car, but the opposite of a Cadillac.  It was a very poorly made car; I be lieve it was made by Ford Motor Company back in the 70s.  They don’t make Pintos an ymore, but because it had the reputation for being such a bad car people may still use it as an example of something of very poor quality.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
