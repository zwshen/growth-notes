This episode is called “Using Coupons and Rebates.”  Many p eople use coupons and rebates to save money.  We’ll talk about what those are by listening to a dialogue between Torsten and Cindy.  Let’s go! 

[start of dialogue] 

Torsten:  What are you doing, clipping coupons?  That’s a  waste of time. 

Cindy:  You can think what you like, but these days, we have  to cut corners wherever we can. 

Torsten:  No one actually saves much money using coupons. 

Cindy:  That’s what you think.  The last time I went to the grocery store, I saved over $20 just by using coupons.   

Torsten:  How can you keep track of all of the expiration  dates and the terms and conditions?  It’s not worth the trouble. 

Cindy:  Do you feel that way about rebate offers, too?  A month ago, I bought our new TV and saved 20 percent.  And yesterday, I bought a  pack of DVDs for just $2. 

Torsten:  Are you putting me on?  A pack of DVDs for $2?  

Cindy:  Yeah, it was a great offer, but it was only for  one day.  I had to cut out the UPC code, fill out a form, and mail it in with the r eceipt to the manufacturer.   

 Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the retailer a nd got another discount.  That’s how I got the DVDs for next to nothing. 

Torsten:  You might save money with rebates, but you have to sit around forever waiting for the rebate check.   

Cindy:  It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 we eks, but some of the offers are worth the wait. 

Torsten:  Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess aroun d with coupons and rebates. 

Cindy:  That’s why you married a penny-pincher.  If I le ft it up to you, we’d be in the poorhouse by now! 

[end of dialogue] 

Torsten begins by asking Cindy, “What are you doing, clipp ing coupons?”  To “clip” (clip) something means to cut something, sometimes  to make it shorter or smaller.  Here, it means to cut something to separate i t from what is around it.  A “coupon” is a small piece of paper, usually, that a shoppe r (someone in a store) will show in order to get a discount.  In the newspaper s and magazines you’ll often see coupons, and you cut the coupon out (we woul d say you “clip” the coupon) and take it to usually a grocery store, but it co uld be another kind of store, and you get a “discount,” you get to pay less money for that thing.   

Torsten thinks clipping coupons is a waste of time.  Cindy sa ys, “You can think what you like (meaning I don’t care what you think), but  these days (nowadays), we have to cut corners wherever we can.”  To “cut corners”  means to save money or to save time by doing something differently, som ething that is not the normal or usual way.  Usually cutting corners refers to savin g money, but it could be saving time.  You don’t want the airline pilot, fo r example, to cut corners when it comes to your safety; you want him to take as much time as possible – or her. 

Cindy says that they have to cut corners wherever they can.  Torsten says, “No one actually saves much money using coupons.”  Cindy says, “Tha t’s what you think.”  The expression “that’s what you think” means you di sagree with what the other person has said.  Usually, this is followed by your re asons why you think that person is wrong.  Notice that there’s an emphasis o n the word “you”: “Well,  

 that’s what you think, but...” and then you give your rea sons why this person is wrong. 

Cindy says the last time she went to the grocery store to bu y food; she saved over $20 just by using coupons.  Torsten says, “How can you kee p track of all of the expiration dates and terms and conditions?”  An “e xpiration date” is the date after which something cannot be used or something will no longer be valid.  So, if the coupon has an expiration date of November 1st that means that you can’t use it after November 1st.  “Terms and conditions,” what some people in the busin ess world call “Ts and Cs” – “terms and conditions” are pa rts of a legal agreement that give specific details about how something will work o r how something will function.  So, it’s the legal information about what you are selling or what service you are providing. 

Torsten says that coupons are “not worth the trouble,” me aning they are not beneficial; they don’t really help very much, especially be cause you have to spend time clipping them and so forth.  Cindy says, “Do you  feel that way about rebate offers, too?”  A “rebate” is money that you get  back from the company that makes or sells a product (something that you buy).  After yo u buy it you can get, from some companies on some products, a rebate – money back.   Now, often you have to do something to get that money back.  A “reba te offer” is when the company says that they will give you some of your money back, or perhaps even all of the money back, if you buy this thing at a certain time or on a certain day, and usually you have to prove that you bought it.  So you  have to send a form – send a piece of paper to the company with a copy of you r receipt or some other what we would call “proof of purchase,” meaning eviden ce that you bought something.   

Cindy says a month ago she bought a pack (or a set) of DVDs for just two dollars.  Torsten says, “Are you putting me on?”  To “put  someone on” is a phrasal verb meaning to trick someone, to deceive someone, to get someone to believe something that isn’t true.  Sometimes people do  this just to be funny. When I say, for example, that you can find tickets to Haw aii in our Learning Guide for this episode, I’m putting you on; I’m not r eally serious.  Really, I’m not; we don’t have tickets in our Learning Guide for this epi sode, I’m sorry! 

Cindy says, “it was a great offer, but it was only for one  day.”  So, of course, she’s not putting Torsten on, she’s telling the truth.  She then explains how she got the rebate.  She said she had to cut out the UPC code.  The “UPC code” stands for Universal Product Code; sometimes we call it simp ly the “bar code.”   

 It’s a small rectangle that you will find on most packages – most things that are sold in the United States in a store – that has many vert ical black lines and numbers that a machine can read.  That is, the machine can detect what the price is and what the thing is.  Most stores have a special machine call a “scanner” that you use with these UPC, or bar codes.   

However, Cindy is cutting out the UPC code as a proof of purchase, evidence that she bought this thing.  In order to get the reba te, Cindy has to fill out a “form,” a piece of paper with her name and address on it, and mail that form in with the receipt to the manufacturer.  The “receipt”  is the piece of paper the store gives you to show that you bought something; it has the p rice of what you bought.  The “manufacturer” is the company that makes a p roduct – a physical product.  Computers are manufactured by companies such as A pple and other computer companies, for example. 

Cindy says, “Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the ret ailer and got another discount.”  The “retailer” is the store that sold the pr oduct.  So we have the manufacturer that made the product, and then you have t he store that sold it. Cindy is actually getting two rebates here, one from th e manufacturer and one from the store – the retailer.  She got another “disco unt,” which is a reduction in the price of something.  “Discount” has a couple of diffe rent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Torsten says, “You might save money with rebates, but you h ave to sit around (you have to wait) forever for the rebate check.”  The “rebate check” is the money that the company is sending you back.  Sometimes it will  be $5, $10; it could be $500, depending on how big the rebate is, and, of cou rse, depending on what you buy.  Now, not every company offers rebates on their pr oducts.  It’s something that only some companies do sometimes to get pe ople to buy their product.   

Cindy says, “It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 weeks.”  The “turnaround” is the amount of time needed to send something, have t he company look at it, take care of it, and then send, in this case, the rebate check back.  So it’s the time that you send something in and then you get it ba ck.  We can use this word in talking about anything that you, for example, submit an application for and then have to wait before you get back whatever you are waiting  for.  If you are going to get a driver’s license in the United States, there ma y be a certain turnaround time.  That is, it may take a few days or even a few we eks for the state government to send you your physical license.  Cindy says that the offers (the  

 rebate offers) are “worth the wait,” meaning they ar e good enough that one is willing to wait a long period of time to receive it. 

Torsten says, “Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess aro und with coupons and rebates.”  To “mess around,” here, means to spend t ime doing something that is not productive, that is not a good use of your t ime.  We also use this expression, to mess around, in talking about children wh o are misbehaving, who are playing and perhaps causing problems.  It can also be used in a sexual way; to mess around may be to engage in some sort of sexual act ivity.  I’m married, so I wouldn’t know! 

Cindy says, “That’s why you married a penny-pincher.”  The term “penny- pincher” refers to someone who doesn’t like to spend mone y, who always is looking for the lowest price for something.  Cindy says, “I f I left it up to you (meaning if you were in charge of the situation), we’d  be in the poorhouse by now!”  The “poorhouse” is a place where, many years ago, very poor people would go for help when they didn’t have enough money  or they didn’t have a place to eat.  Poorhouses were common, for example, in t he 19th century in England.  If you read a novel by Charles Dickens, he oft en talks about these poorhouses.  They were not very nice places to be.  Here, Cindy is using the expression just to mean we would be poor, we would not  have very much money. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
