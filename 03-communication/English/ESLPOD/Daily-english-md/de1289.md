# Problems With Drinking Water

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,289 – Problems with Drinking Water.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,289. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. This episode is a dialogue between Yulia and Jack about drinking water – and the water you shoul dn’t drink. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yulia: Wait! Don’t drink that.

Jack: Why not? I’m really thirsty.

Yulia: That’s a standing pool of water. There could  be all kinds of microorganisms living in there.

Jack: Fine, but somebody should have brought more w ater for this long walk.

Yulia: I know. It’s my fault. Hey, there’s a cabin.  Maybe there’s somebody there who can give us some water. Do you see a well?

Jack: No, no well, and I don’t see an outdoor fauce t either. In fact, I don’t see any signs of life inside. But hey, the door is unlocked .

Yulia: Are you sure we should just walk in?

Jack: I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re a fraid to go in. Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap. Let’s see if there are any wa ter tanks or rain barrels out back.

Yulia: I’m not drinking rainwater or runoff from the roof.

Jack: Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of water.

Yulia: Wait! You don’t know if that’s potable. It c ould be untreated water with sewage or worse.

Jack: You can wait for some nice filtered water, bu t I’m not picky. I just need to quench my thirst.

Yulia: You should at least boil it first. Oh my God , I just saw something swimming in it!

Jack: I’m sure it’s willing to share.

Yulia says to Jack, “Wait! Don’t drink that.” Jack says, “Why not? I’m really thirsty.” “To be thirsty” (thirsty) means to really  want to drink something, such as water or some other beverage, something else that o ne normally drinks. Yulia says, “That’s a standing pool of water.” A “standin g pool (pool) of water” is a small area or a small “body,” we would call it, of water that is not moving. Usually we’re talking about something that is only perhaps three or, at most, four feet around that doesn’t have a lot of water in it. It c ould be larger than that, I suppose.

Another word we might use here for a very small amo unt of water that you see on the ground is “puddle” (puddle). If you are walk ing along the street or down an area and you see water on the ground where there is  a small depression or hole in the ground, we would call that a “puddle,” becau se there isn’t any water moving in or out of it. We might refer to it as a “ standing pool of water.”

Yulia says, “There could be all kinds of microorgan isms living in there.” A “microorganism” (microorganism) is a very small for m of life that cannot be seen by your eyes unless you use what’s called a “micros cope” – a special device that allows you to see things that are very, very small.  Jack says, “Fine,” meaning okay, “but somebody should have brought more water for this long walk.”

We now understand what’s going on here. Jack and Yu lia have gone for some sort of walk, probably away from the city, and they  don’t have enough water. Jack is thirsty and is looking for something to dri nk. Yulia says, “I know. It’s my fault,” meaning “I am the one who is responsible for not bringing enough water.” Then she says, “Hey, there’s a cabin” (cabin).

A “cabin” is a small house that you would find out away from the city, perhaps next to a lake or up in the mountains or out where there isn’t anyone else around. A cabin is often a place where people go on vacatio n, nowadays, to get away from the city. “Maybe there’s somebody there who ca n give us some water,” Yulia says. “Do you see a well?” A “well” (well) is  a very deep hole in the ground

that is created in order to find water. The word “w ell,” of course, is also an adverb in English, but as a noun it refers to a deep hole from which you get water.

Jack says, “No, no well,” meaning no, there is not a well here. He continues, “I don’t see an outdoor faucet either.” “Outdoor” (out door) means outside of a house or a building. The opposite of “outdoor” is, of course, “indoor” (indoor). A “faucet” (faucet) is the metal device that you get water from, usually in a sink. “In fact,” Jack says, “I don’t see any signs of life in side,” meaning he doesn’t think there is anyone inside of the cabin. “But hey, the door is unlocked,” meaning whoever owns this cabin has not locked the door.

Yulia says, “Are you sure we should just walk in?” Are you sure we should go into this cabin? Because, after all, it isn’t their cabi n. Jack responds, “I’m not dying of thirst just because you’re afraid to go in.” He mea ns “I’m not going to die here in the middle of nowhere just because the owner of the  cabin isn’t there.” He’s going to go in, even though it doesn’t belong to hi m, to see if he can find some water.

Then he says, “Oh no! Nothing comes out of the tap”  (tap). The “tap” is another word for the faucet. It’s where you get water from in a sink. Normally you can turn a tap on, and when you do, the water comes out of t he tap. But when Jack turns the tap on, nothing comes out, meaning there is no water there.

Then he says, “Let’s see if there are any water tan ks or rain barrels out back.” A “water tank” (tank) is a large container that is us ed to put water in. Sometimes, if you live away from the city, you may have your wate r in a big tank. My parents used to have a small cabin up in the northern part of Minnesota near a lake, and we had a water tank where the water was kept so tha t we could have water to drink and cook and so forth.

A “rain barrel” (barrel) is a large container that collects the water from a rainfall. If you live away from the city and you need water, you  might have a rain barrel that collects rain as it comes down. It stores the water  in the barrel so you can use it later, often to do things such as give water to pla nts and so forth.

Yulia says, “I’m not drinking rain water or runoff from the roof.” Jack proposes they look for a rain barrel or a water tank in the back of the cabin, but Yulia says, “No, I’m not going to drink rainwater” – that is, t he water that comes from the sky as rain. She is also not going to drink any “runoff ” (runoff). “Runoff” is water that usually has gone over some surface such as the roof  of a house.

If you have rain on your house, the water probably goes somewhere. It doesn’t stay on the top of your house. Well, we would call that water “runoff” because it has come from some other surface or gone over some other surface. It has “drained,” we would say, away from your roof. You c ould also have runoff from a street or a road. “Runoff” is usually water coming from a rainstorm, but not always. It could be from some other machine or sour ce of liquid.

Jack says, “Suit yourself, but here’s a tub of wate r.” “Suit (suit) yourself,” means “That’s fine – you can make your own decisions for you, but I’m going to do something different.” He says, “Here’s a tub (tub) of water.” A “tub” is normally something we use to bathe in. You can get yourself clean with soap and water in a bathtub. The word “tub” can refer to any large co ntainer used for either bathing, that is getting your body clean, or washing, such a s washing your clothes.

Yulia says, “Wait! You don’t know if that’s” – mean ing the water in the tub – “if that’s potable” (potable). “Potable” means somethin g you can drink, something that is safe to drink. Not all water, of course, is  safe to drink for humans. Yulia says that that water “could be untreated water with  sewage or worse.” “Untreated” means that it isn’t clean. It hasn’t be en prepared for humans to drink. “Sewage” (sewage) is what we call wastewater. It’s any sort of water or liquid that has something dirty in it, including things that co me out of your body, if you know what I mean.

Jack says, “You can wait for some nice filtered wat er, but I’m not picky.” “Filtered (filtered) water” is water that has been cleaned. W e would say it is water that has been “purified.” You’ve gotten rid of all the bad t hings that might make you sick in the water. Jack says he’s not “picky” (picky). “To be picky” means to be very selective about what you eat or drink, or what you will accept. “Oh, I don’t want any of that; I don’t want any of that; I don’t want  any of that; I only want this.” That’s being “picky” – when you only want certain t hings or are only happy with certain things.

Jack says, “I just need to quench my thirst.” “To q uench (quench) your thirst (thirst)” means to drink something so that you are no longer thirsty. You no longer have a strong desire to drink. Yulia says, “You sho uld at least boil it first.” Yulia is telling Jack he should “boil” (boil) the water. “To  boil” water or any other liquid means to bring it to a temperature that causes litt le bubbles, little bits of air to come out of the liquid – to bring it, that is, to w hat we would call a “gaseous state.”

In Fahrenheit, 212 degrees is the temperature at wh ich water will boil, although that depends exactly on how high up in the air you are. Here in Los Angeles,

we’re basically at sea level, so 212 degrees Fahren heit is about right. That would be 100 degrees Celsius for the rest of the world. Y ulia thinks that Jack should boil the water. Then she says, “I just saw somethin g swimming in it” – that is, she saw some little animal, perhaps a little fish even,  swimming in the water.

Jack isn’t concerned. He says, “I’m sure it’s willi ng to share,” meaning “I’m sure this little animal will let me have some water as w ell.” He’s obviously not concerned about getting sick from what appears to b e unclean water.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
