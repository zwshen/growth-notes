It’s called “Types of Sandwiches.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Geraldo:  I am so hungry.  When can we go eat?  Natasha:  Just another minute and I’ll be finished here.  What do you have a craving for?  Geraldo:  I want a good sandwich, maybe a BLT or a pastrami on rye.  Now that I think of it, a Reuben or a club sandwich would really hit the spot.  I wonder if Nathan’s is still open.    Natasha:  I doubt it.  It’s really late.  Geraldo:  In that case, maybe we can find a diner where I can get a French dip or a cheesesteak sandwich.  I’d even settle for a tuna or chicken salad sandwich.  Natasha:  The nearest diner is closed for renovations, remember?    Geraldo:  What are we going to do?  Natasha:  I know of a place that’s open and ready to serve.  Geraldo:  Where?  Natasha:  My place.  Geraldo:  You can make me a good sandwich?
