# Paying the Bills

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 148: Paying the Bills. 

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 148. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

On this podcast, we’re going to pay our bills. Let’ s go! 

[start of dialog] 

Grace: Did you already pay the bills for this month ? 

Will: No, I haven't gotten around to it yet. Why? 

Grace: We got a late notice from the credit card co mpany. The notice says that they haven't received the payment yet and it's past  the due date. We are being charged a late fee plus a finance charge of 15%.  

Will: Let me see that. That can't be right. I paid the minimum payment on the last bill. I better call and talk to customer service to morrow. I'm sure it's a mix-up. 

Grace: I really hope so. The last time we were late  with the payment, I tried calling them and telling them that the check was in  the mail, but they didn't buy it. 

Will: That's different. Don't worry about it. I'm s ure I'll get it straightened out. Worse comes to worst, we're only a month late. They  won't send the collection agency after us.  

Grace: I know I can count on you to take care of it . I just don't want this late payment to affect our credit rating.  

Will: Leave it to me. I'll take care of it on Monda y. It's as good as done. 

[end of dialog] 

In this podcast, we talk about paying the “bills.” The “bills” (bills) means the expenses or the things that you have to pay such as  your telephone and your electricity and your water. You have to pay the bil ls, the bills of your house. Well,  

in this dialog, Grace, the woman, says, “Did you al ready pay the bills for this month?” And Will says, “No. I haven’t gotten around  to it yet.” “To get around to something” means that you are planning on doing it but you haven’t done it yet. Maybe because you don’t think it’s very important o r maybe because you’ve been so busy that you haven’t been able to do it. S o, that expression, “Have you got around to it yet?” “No. I haven’t,” means I hav en’t done it yet, but I am planning on doing it. 

Well, Grace says that they received a “late notice”  from the credit card company. A “late notice (notice)” is when you do not pay you r credit card bill or any bill on time when you are supposed to. And after maybe five , ten days, the company will send you a “late notice,” telling you that you are late in paying the bill. The notice that Grace received says they haven’t received the payment yet, and it’s past the due date. The “payment” is (payment) the money that  they send to the company to pay your bill or pay their bill, in this case.  

The “due date” – (due) “date” (date) – the “due dat e” is the day that something has to be paid. It is the deadline for when you hav e to pay a certain bill. To say something is “past the due date” is the same as say ing it’s “past due.” “It’s past due” (past) “due” (due) – is the same as it is afte r the day or the date that something has to be paid. Well, they’re being charg ed a “late fee” plus a “finance charge.” A “late fee” (fee) is extra money they hav e to pay because they are late. And a “finance charge” (finance) – a “finance charg e” is money – a percentage – that you have to pay on what you owe. This, of cour se is how credit card companies make money – one way they make money as t hat, if you don’t pay off or pay completely what you owe every month, you hav e a “finance charge.” And it’s like interest that you pay on a loan.  

Well, Will says that he can’t believe what has happ ened. He says he paid the minimum payment on the last bill. The “minimum” (mi nimum) – the “minimum payment” is the least amount. So, for credit card c ompanies – VISA, Mastercard – they will say, “Well, you spent $500. You don’t h ave to pay us $500. This month you can pay us just $50 and we will charge yo u interest on the rest of the money. So, the $50 is the least amount – the minimu m payment. And if you pay the minimum payment, you don’t have a late fee. But  you do have a finance charge. Will says that “I better call and talk to c ustomer service tomorrow.” “I better call” (better) means “I ought to call.” “I s hould call.” And that’s a common way that we say that. For example, “You better go t o school” means you should, you ought to go to school. It’s somewhat informal.  

Well, Will says, “I better call and talk to custome r service.” “Customer service” is the department in a company that takes care of its customers, that if you have a  

problem or a complaint, these are the people you ca ll and you end up waiting on the telephone for many hours – that’s customer serv ice. “Customers” just, of course, another word for the person who is buying t he product or service. Will says that he’s sure it’s a “mix-up.” A “mix-up” (mi x-up) is a mistake. When someone says there was a “mix-up,” they mean there was some confusion. There was some problem, some error. Grace says that  she tried calling the credit card company the last time they were late and told them that the check was “in the mail.” That expression “The check is in the mai l” is sometimes used as a joke, meaning I have already sent you the money and  it is in the mail service – they haven’t delivered it yet. Many people say that , something as a joke because of course, you can always say, “Oh, yeah. I mailed the check already. You just have not received it.”  

Well, according to Grace, the company – the credit card company – didn’t buy her reason, didn’t buy her excuse. She says, “They didn’t buy it.” In this case, “to buy” means to believe, not to purchase something wi th money – that’s also a use of the verb “to buy,” but here it means simply “to believe something,” usually something that is an excuse, perhaps or some explan ation that may not be true. We will sometimes say, “Well, she told me that she loved me, but I don’t buy it. I don’t believe it.” Isn’t that one of our great prob lems in the world? Well, Will says that this situation here is different, that he’s su re he can get it “straightened out.” To get something “straightened out” (straightened) – “to straighten something out” or “to get it straightened out” means to get i t fixed, to solve the problem, to end the confusion. If there was a mix-up, you can “ straighten it out” – means you can undo or tell the person what actually happened and end the confusion.  

Will then says, “Worse comes to worst, we’re only a  month late.” The expression “worse (worse) comes to worst (worst)” means that i n the worst possible situation. We sometimes say, “Worst case scenario.”  A “scenario” (scenario) is like a situation. So, what he’s saying here is “Eve n if the worst thing” – and “worst,” of course, comes – bad, worse, worst, righ t? – something that is more bad is “worst.” We don’t say “more bad.” We say “wo rst” – something that is the worst situation is the most negative possible situa tion. So, “Worse comes to worst,” Will says, “we’re only a month late. They w on’t send the collection agency after us.” A “collection (collection) agency (agenc y)” – a “collection agency” – these are usually private companies that are respon sible for getting money that is owed to companies. So, when people don’t pay their bills, for many months, there will be a collection company that will call t hem, mail them, try to get them to pay their bills. These collection agencies take a p ercentage of how much the bill is, and that’s how they make money.  

Well, Grace says that she knows she can “count on” Will. “To count on” means to rely on. She says, “I don’t want this late payment to affect our credit rating.” Your “credit (credit) rating (rating)” is the informatio n that companies look at when they want to see if you are good with your money – if yo u had paid your bills on time. And if you don’t, you can get a “bad credit rating. ” And in the United States, that’s very important because if you want to buy a house o r buy a car, and you have a bad credit rating, many companies will not give mon ey to you. So, it’s important to have a good credit rating by paying your bills o n time. Will says to Grace, “Leave it to me,” meaning let me take care of it. I  will handle it. I will solve the problem. “It’s as good as done.” “It’s as good as d one” means you don’t have to worry about it. I’m going to do it and there’ll be no problems. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. [start of dialog]
