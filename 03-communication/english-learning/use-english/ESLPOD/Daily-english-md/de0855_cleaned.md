This episode is a story about learning fire safety – learning to make sure that you don’t accidentally cause a fire that will damage yo ur house or building. Sounds like a good idea.

Our story begins with me – the person telling the s tory – saying that “the apartment manager” – the person who takes care of t he apartment where I live, in the story – “asked all of the tenants” – the peo ple who rent apartments – “to come to a short meeting to learn about fire safety. ” “Fire safety” are things you should do in order to prevent fires and to keep peo ple safe if there is a fire. I say that “I didn’t want to go, but that the manager sai d that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza?” “To turn dow n” is a phrasal verb which, here, means to decide not to do something or not to  have something, to say no to someone. “I asked a beautiful woman out on a date a nd she turned me down.” She said, “No, thank you, Jeff.” Well, this was man y years ago, of course. I actually put this in the form of a question – “Who am I to turn down free pizza?” When we say, “Who am I to do something,” we’re kind  of making a joke about it, saying, “Well, I’m not an important enough person t o say no,” or “I have to do this,” or “I don’t have any right or any permission  to do something differently.” 

The apartment manager begins, then – and he sounds a lot like me – by saying, “Thank you all for coming to this meeting about fir e safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recently, it seemed like a goo d idea to talk about fire safety with all of you.” A “rash” (rash) is when something  is very common – a short period of time, usually, when something bad is happ ening. If there were four people murdered in the last week, we could talk abo ut a “rash of murders” here in Los Angeles. I’m not saying there were, maybe there  were, but that would be an example. Or, “There have been a rash of cases invol ving people who are stealing cars.” Usually, the word “rash” is used when someth ing bad happens. Well, this is a case where something bad is happening. There h ave been a rash of fires in the neighborhood.  

The manager says that he wants to make sure we “com ply” with the “fire code.” “To comply” (comply) means to follow the rules or t o follow the laws, to do what you are supposed to do. The “fire code” are a serie s or a set of rules and regulations, or laws, established to protect people  from fires. So, when you build a new building, or you build a house, you have to f ollow the rules to make sure that you’re not building something that could be da ngerous. Those rules are called the “fire code (code).” The word “code” is o ften used to describe government regulations that you have to follow. And  if you don’t follow them, you could be in trouble.  

The manager says he’s “installed new smoke alarms.”  “To install” (install) means to put something into place, often to attach it to something so that it can be used. “I’m going to install a new sink in my bathroom.” I ’m going to put it in. I’m going to put it in place. We talk about, on our computers, “ installing software.” We download it from the Internet or we buy it, and we put it on to our hard drive, our  

computer. That is also another use of the verb “ins tall.” The manager has installed, or put in, new “smoke alarms.”  

“Smoke” (smoke) is when something burns and it give s off a certain substance that floats in the air. If you breathe it, you will  probably cough and it could kill you. “Smoke” happens when there is a fire. In fact, ther e’s an old expression “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire,” meaning if you see an  indication of a problem, there probably is a real problem, maybe even more serious  than you know. However, a “smoke alarm” is a device, a small instrument, that  makes a noise when there is smoke in the room. Most houses have smoke alarms, a t least a couple of them. “Smoke alarms” are required in public buildings.  

Well, the apartment manager installed new smoke ala rms or he replaced, or put in, batteries in the older ones. A “battery” (batte ry) is a small object that provides electricity to a machine. It can often be removed, unless you have certain kinds of phones where the battery can’t be removed, at le ast not by you. But most batteries are things you can take out and put new o nes in or you can what we would call “recharge” them. You can give them more power, new power so that they will work again. The manager continues by sayi ng that the “fire escapes” are in good condition. A “fire escape” (escape) is a wa y of leaving a building in the case of a fire. We often think about fire escapes a s being stairs, metal stairs on the outside of a building, so that if you’re in a b uilding, you can climb out the window, you can exit the building through the windo w, onto these stairs that area outside. We would call them “fire escapes.” A “fire  escape” might also be a ladder that is put up on the side of a building or more ty pically, dropped down from the window. Those are examples of fire escapes.  

The manager says, “The fire escapes in the apartmen t building are in good condition” – they’re working fine, no problems – “a nd there are fire extinguishers in each hallway.” An “extinguisher” is something th at extinguishes. The verb “to extinguish” (extinguish) means to stop something, i n this case, from burning, usually. A fire extinguisher is a metal container, a cylinder, often painted red or yellow, that has special chemicals in it that when you spray it on a fire, it will put the fire out. It will stop the fire. That’s a “fire  extinguisher.”  

The manager says the fire extinguishers are in each  “hallway.” A “hallway” is a space that connects different rooms in a building o r in a house, in this case, in the apartment building. The manager concludes by sa ying, “Your job” – meaning what the tenants, the renters are supposed to do – “is keep the inside of your apartments safe. Keep flammable objects away from t he fireplace.” “Flammable” (flammable) is something that will burn easily. And  if something burns easily, if it  

can “catch fire,” we might say, easily, you don’t w ant to put it near your fireplace where you might be burning wood to bring heat into your house.  

Also, “Don’t overload your electrical outlets,” the  manager says. “To overload” (overload) means to put too much pressure or to dem and too much of something, or someone. In this case, it would be trying to plu g in all of your electrical devices into one electrical circuit or even one plug, one o utlet. This, in some cases, can be dangerous and can even start a fire. “Electrical  outlets” (outlets) are the things that you plug your power cords into, what gives you  electricity – we call those “outlets,” “electrical outlets.” 

 “Any questions?”  the manager says. “If not, we’re  ready for a fire drill.” A “fire drill” (drill) is an event where people in a buildi ng are asked to pretend – to imagine – that there is a fire, and practice leavin g the building quickly and in an orderly way, usually going outside and all meeting in the same spot. “Fire drills” are things that typically happen in schools, especi ally the elementary and high schools. We would have a fire drill at least once, sometimes twice a year, where the fire bell would ring and everyone would have to  stand up and walk out of the school in a calm and orderly way. That’s a “fire dr ill.” It’s something you don’t usually see in a building, an office building or a commercial building nowadays. But it is still quite common in schools, because we  want to train students on what to do if there is a fire.  

I end the story by saying, “Nobody told me that the re would be a fire drill. I guess I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll as long as I can take the pizza with me.” “To stop, drop, and roll” is a common phrase used to re mind people what they should do if they are in a building during a fire. You sto p whatever you’re doing. You drop or fall down to the ground, and then you roll along the ground to move toward the exit while preventing or stopping your c lothes from catching on fire – “Stop, drop, and roll.” That’s the recommended proc edure. Most people, of course, use another procedure when a fire breaks ou t in their building, and that’s “Run like hell!” – which is a somewhat vulgar way o f saying “Run really fast!” 

Now let’s listen to the story this time, at a norma l speed. 

[start of story] 

The apartment manager asked all of the tenants to c ome to a short meeting to learn about fire safety.  I didn’t want to go, but the manager said that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza? ... 

Apartment manager:  Thank you all for coming to thi s meeting about fire safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recentl y, it seemed like a good idea to talk about fire safety with all of you. 

I want to make sure we comply with the fire code, s o I’ve installed new smoke alarms or replaced the batteries in the older ones in each apartment and in the hallways.  The fire escapes are in good condition a nd there are fire extinguishers in each hallway. 

Your job is to keep the inside of your apartments s afe.  Keep flammable items away from the fireplace and don’t overload your ele ctrical outlets.  Any questions?  If not, we’re ready for a fire drill. ... 

Nobody told me there would be fire drill.  I’m gues s I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll – as long as I can take the pizza with me.
