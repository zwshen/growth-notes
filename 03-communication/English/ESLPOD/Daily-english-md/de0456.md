This episode is called “Sending Business Packages.”  It’s a d ialogue between Sam and Maria using some common vocabulary you would hear if you were going to send a package, a large box for example, for you r business.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maria:  I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wed nesday.

Sam:  Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their grou nd service.  It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their overnight service and we can st ill track it.  Is it going to a business?

Maria:  Yes, it is.

Sam:  Okay, I’ll mark that it’s going to a commercial add ress.

Maria:  That’s fine.  I’ll also need these contracts to g et to Tokyo by Friday.  Send it to the home of the president of the company.

Sam:  I’ll send it DHL and use the residential delivery service.  This seems like a large package for just contracts.

Maria:  I’m also including a gift for the president’s w ife.

Sam:  If it’s breakable, I’ll pack it really well and th en get it insured.  What’s the declared value?

 Maria:  It’s about $700.  Oh, and I want this box to g o to Olten, Switzerland, but just send it regular mail through the post office.  Make  sure I get delivery confirmation, though.

Sam:  No problem.  I’ll just need to fill out a custom s declaration form.  What are the contents?

Maria:  They’re books.

Sam:  Okay, I’ll take care of it.

Maria:  Thanks.  What would I do without you?

Sam:  The real question is, what would the mail services do without you?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Maria saying to Sam, “I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wednesday.”  Tulsa is a city in the state of O klahoma, which is right in the middle (central) part of the United Sta tes.  A “package” describes any sort of box or perhaps a large envelope that you are s ending to someone.  Sam says, “Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their ground  service.”  UPS stands for United Parcel Service, FedEx stands for Federal Express;  those are two private mail companies in the United States that you can  use to send packages if you need them to get there quickly.  “Ground service,” or simply we often just say sending it “ground,” means that it is going to go into  a truck or a train in order to be delivered; it is not going on a boat or on a plane .  Ground service is the slowest service, usually.  If you send a package from Los Ange les ground, or UPS ground, to New York it’ll probably take four days to  get there, maybe five. Sam says, “It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their o vernight service and we can still track it.”  “Overnight service” means that the pa ckage will arrive the next morning or the next afternoon, taking 24 hours or so to  get to where you are sending it.  If you have a very important letter or docum ent that someone needs by tomorrow, you would have to send it overnight.  Somet imes that’s called “express service.”  Both private companies such as UPS and Fe dEX, as well as the public mail service in the United States, the U.S. P ostal Service, all of them offer overnight service.

Sam says that they will be able to track the package, that can be done when you send something overnight or if you send it ground.  To  “track” means to know where something is, to follow something.  Nowadays, you ca n go online and you

 can put the number of the package in there and it will  tell you where that package is as it travels from your city to the place where you are sending it.  Sam asks, “Is it going to a business?”  You could send a package to a business or a house. Maria says, “Yes, it is.”  Sam says, “Okay, I’ll mark that it’ s going to a commercial address.”  To “mark” something means to write or indicat e on a form some piece of information, something that is different about th at particular thing.  For example, you could mark your house with orange balloons; you would put orange balloons to indicate – to show that it is a particular place where people would want to come for a party, for example.  I don’t know wh y you would put orange balloons on your house – maybe you’re crazy!

In any case, Sam is going to mark or indicate on the form  that it is going to a commercial address.  “Commercial” is just another word for  a business address. Maria says, “That’s fine.  I’ll also need these contracts to get to Tokyo by Friday.” “Contracts” are legal agreements between two people.  Maria wants to send these contracts to Tokyo, Japan by Friday.  Maria says, “Send it to the home of the president of the company.”  Sam says, “I’ll send it DH L and use the residential delivery service.”  DHL is another internation al mail company that delivers packages.  “Residential” is just another word for home, so sending something to a residential address means you are sending it to a home address.

Maria says, “I’m also including a gift for the president ’s wife.”  Sam says, “If it’s breakable, I’ll pack it really well and then get it insu red.”  If the gift is “breakable” that means that it can break easily; we might also use the  word “fragile.” Sometimes if you are sending a package that has something  that could break easily, you put the word “fragile” (fragile) on the ou tside of the package.  That won’t actually make any difference, but you’ll feel bette r by doing it thinking that you’re doing something!  Sam says he’s going to pack it rea l well.  To “pack” something means to put something in a container – an e nvelope, a box – and then send it somewhere.  We also use the verb “to pack” f or other meanings in English, take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Here, Sam is packing this gift in the package, and then h e’s going to get it insured.  To “insure” something means to have some sort of financial protection, often offered by an insurance company, so if something bad happens the company will give you money for what was lost or damaged.   Most of the private mail services have insurance that you can buy in case the packa ge gets lost or something happens to it.  Sam then asks Maria what the d eclared value is of the gift.  The “value” is what it is worth, the amount of money.  To “declare” something means to say or to state something, usually on a form or a piece of paper, something official.  So, “declared value” is the  amount of money that you are saying this is worth, and you put that down on the package so that you have

 enough insurance.  So if the package gets lost and you declared the value, you said it was worth $400, then you will get $400 back.  T hat’s what declared value is.

Maria says, “It’s about $700.”  Wow, a pretty nice gift!  Maria says, “Oh, and I want this box to go to Olten, Switzerland, but just send  it regular mail through the post office,” meaning through the public mail system.  M aria says, “Make sure I get delivery confirmation, though.”  “Delivery confirma tion” is a service where the sender can use his or her phone or the Internet to find  out exactly when the package arrived and where it was delivered, if it was del ivered to the right place. To “confirm” something means, in this case, to inform you  – to make sure that something happened.

Sam says, “No problem,” of course.  “I’ll just need to f ill out a customs declaration form.”  “Customs” is the government office that makes sure that you are not bringing something into the country that is illegal or not allowed.  A “customs declaration form” is a form – a piece of paper that sa ys this is what is in this package.  If you are sending something to another country the mail service may have to inspect what you are sending, you would put a cust oms declarations form to tell the customs office that this is what I am se nding so they know it is nothing illegal or nothing that you have to pay a tax o n.

Sam says, “What are the contents?” meaning what is inside the box or the package that she is sending to Olten, Switzerland, and M aria says, “They’re books.”  Sam says, “Okay, I’ll take care of it” – I’ll han dle it.  Maria says, “Thanks. What would I do without you?” which is a question – a n expression that people say when the person has been so helpful to them, so valuab le to them: “What would I do without you?”  Sam says, “The real question is, what would the mail services do without you?” because, of course, she’s giving th ese companies so much business by sending so many packages.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

What would we do without our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse ?  I don’t know!
