This episode is a dialogue – a short dialogue – bet ween Andre and Dana about measuring mass and volume. Sounds exciting. Let’s g et started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Andre: Three gallons of water. 

Dana: Check. 

Andre: A quart of lemon juice. 

Dana: Got it. 

Andre: A tablespoon of bleach. 

Dana: Bleach? 

Andre: Bleach. A pint of vinegar. 

Dana: It’s in there. 

Andre: A cup of baking soda. 

Dana: Okay. 

Andre: A teaspoon of liquid detergent. 

Dana: Done.  

 Andre: A pound of bath salts. 

Dana: A pound? 

Andre: A pound. Three tablespoons of chlorine. 

Dana: Okay. 

Andre: An ounce of perfume. 

Dana: Done. Do you really think this is necessary? 

Andre: Have you smelled your stinky dog?! 

[end of dialogue] 

Andre begins our dialogue by saying, “Three gallons  of water.” This dialogue is mostly Andre telling Dana about the quantity, mass,  or volume of liquid that the two of them are using for something. We’ll find out  what that is at the end of the dialogue. The first item, the first thing Andre say s, is “Three gallons of water.” A “gallon” (gallon) is a way of measuring what we wou ld describe as “liquid volume.”  

Certain substances, such as water, can be either li quid, solid, or gas in form. Water that is solid is called “ice.” Water that is liquid is usually just referred to as “water.” Well, a “gallon” is a way of measuring the  amount, or “volume” (volume), of liquid. I said “volume” is the quantity – techni cally it’s the amount of space that is taken up by a certain substance. That substance could be liquid, but it also could be in the form of a gas. Three gallons of wat er, then, equals, for the rest of you, 3.78 liters.  

A gallon in the U.S. is divided into, or can be div ided into, four parts. You could divide a gallon into four what we call “quarts” (qu arts). The word “quart” comes from the word “quarter,” which is 25 percent of som ething. So, one gallon in the U.S. equals four quarts. A quart is a little less t han one liter. Now, a quart can be divided into two equal parts called “pints” (pints) . A “pint” is about a half a liter. So we have the formula, if you will, two pints equals a quart, four quarts equals a gallon.  

Andre starts by saying, “Three gallons of water,” a nd Dana says, “Check.” “Check” (check) has a couple of different meanings.  Here it’s used to show  

agreement or to indicate to someone else that you h ave done something that the person has asked you to do. It’s also used in other  ways. For example, the verb “to check” can mean to look at or to investigate so mething, to make sure something is done. The meaning of “check” in our di alogue is somewhat related to that.  

Dana is indicating that she has done this, that the  task, in this case, of getting three gallons of water has been completed. She’s sa ying that they have three gallons of water. Andre is obviously reading from a  list of things. The second item on his list is “a quart of lemon juice.” Remember a  “quart” is about one liter – one quarter of a gallon. “Lemon juice” is the liquid th at comes from the fruit lemon, which we use to make things like lemonade. Instead of saying “check,” Dana says something equivalent or about the same, which is “Got it,” meaning she understands.  

Andre then says, “A tablespoon of bleach.” Now, we’ ve talked about gallons, quarts, and pints. You can also describe the volume  of something by using measurements related to “spoons” (spoon). A “spoon”  is something that you use to eat food with. You have a “knife,” which is long  and sharp. You have a “fork,” which has typically three or more what we call “tin es” (tines) – those are those little parts that stick out in a fork that you use to put into the food. And you can have a “spoon,” also to eat food.  

You can use “spoons” to measure or to indicate how much there is of something. A “tablespoon” (tablespoon) – all one word – is equ al to about a half a fluid ounce – or for those on the metric system, about 15 milli liters of a substance, of a liquid, typically. A smaller unit of measurement, a smaller  way of measuring the amount of something, is a “teaspoon” (teaspoon). There are  three teaspoons in a tablespoon – or to put it another way, a teaspoon i s one third of a tablespoon, about 4.9 milliliters in the metric system, which o f course Americans don’t use and don’t understand.  

“Bleach” (bleach) is a liquid chemical that is ofte n used to clean things. Technically “bleach” is either sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide. The chemical formulas for that can be found on the inte rnet. This is English, not chemistry we’re teaching here. Dana questions Andre  after he says, “A tablespoon of bleach.” She says, “Bleach?” Notice s he seems to be asking a question. Andre, however, confirms that is exactly what he meant. He says, “Bleach.”  

Then he says, “A pint of vinegar.” A “pint” is, of course, one half of a quart, which is one quarter of a gallon. “Vinegar” (vinegar) is a “sour” (sour) liquid often used  

in cooking but sometimes in cleaning. “Sour” is the  opposite of “sweet.” Sugar is sweet. Vinegar is sour. People often combine oil wi th vinegar in order to make what we would call “salad dressing,” something you would put on vegetables or a salad. Dana responds to Andre by saying, “It’s in t here,” meaning the pint of vinegar is in whatever combination of liquids Andre  and Dana are talking about.  

Andre then says, “A cup of baking soda.” A “cup” (c up) is yet another way of measuring something – measuring liquids, measuring volume. I should probably explain that the title of this episode is “Measurin g Mass (mass) and Volume.” “Mass” is a term used in physics that is related to  volume, but technically I believe it is considered the quantity of substance in a given or certain amount of space. What does that mean? I’m not Einstein. You’l l have to ask a physicist. In conversational English, it’s sometimes used to mean  the same as “weight” (weight).  

In any case, Andre mentions “a cup of baking soda.”  A “cup” is even smaller than a pint. Remember a gallon has four quarts. A quart has two pints. A pint has two cups. So, one half of a pint is one cup – or again,  in the metric system, 237 milliliters. I don’t know how you people can unders tand 237 milliliters. I have no idea what that means, but hey, everyone has their o wn system, right? “Baking soda” is technically known as “sodium bicarbonate.”  It’s a white substance, what we would call a “powder” (powder), that is used in cooking and, again like vinegar, sometimes in cleaning.  

Dana indicates she has that. She says, “Okay.” Then  Andre says, “A teaspoon of liquid detergent.” A “teaspoon,” again, is one thir d of a tablespoon. “Liquid detergent” (detergent) is something you use to clea n something else. It’s a liquid soap. Dana says, “Done.” Andre then says, “A pound of bath salts.” A “pound” (pound) is a unit of measurement, a way that we ind icate how heavy something is, how much it weighs. A pound is equal to a littl e less than a half a kilo. A pound is .45 kilograms. A pound is equal to 16 ounces.  

So just as we can divide a “gallon” into quarts, pi nts, and cups, we can divide a pound into “ounces” (ounces). A pound has sixteen o unces. That makes one ounce equal to 19.6 milliliters. Got that? Understa nd that? Great. Let’s move on. Andre is talking about a pound of “bath (bath) salt s (salts).” “Bath salts” are things you add to water – warm water, usually – to give it a nice smell. Technically bath salts are what we would call “crys tals” (crystals) – a type of substance that, in this case, goes from being solid  to liquid once it is put into water.  

Dana questions the amount of bath salts that Andre is talking about. She says, “A pound?” Andre says, “A pound,” meaning yes, that’s how much I want. Then he says, “Three tablespoons of chlorine.” “Chlorine” ( chlorine) is a liquid that is also commonly used for cleaning. Chlorine is one of the atomic elements. Number 17, for those of you taking notes. Dana says, “Okay.”  

Finally, Andre says, “An ounce” – remember an ounce  is one sixteenth of a pint – “of perfume” (perfume). Perfume is something you pu t on your body to make you smell nice. Usually “perfume” is the word we use fo r a liquid that a woman puts on her body. The liquid a man puts on his body is t ypically called “cologne” (cologne). It’s the same thing basically except we give it a different name for a man versus for a woman, and yes, the name comes fro m the city in Germany, also called Cologne, which must be a very nice-smel ling place to visit.  

Dana (getting back to our dialogue) says, “Done. Do  you really think this is necessary?” she asks. Andre says, “Have you smelled  your stinky dog?!” A “stinky (stinky) dog” is a dog that has a bad smell , a bad “odor” (odor). Another word we could use for “stinky” is “smelly.” Apparently Dana and Andre are washing Andre’s dog.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Dana: Check. 

Andre: A quart of lemon juice. 

Dana: Got it.
