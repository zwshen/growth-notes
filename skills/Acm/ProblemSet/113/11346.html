<p>Consider rectangular coordinate system and point L(X,Y) which is randomly
chosen among all points in the area A which is defined in the following manner:
A = {(x,y) | x is from interval [-a;a]; y is from interval  [-b;b]}. What is the probability P that the area of
a rectangle that is defined by points (0,0) and (X,Y) will be greater than S?</p>
	
<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
The number of tests N &#60= 200 is given on the first line of input. Then N
lines with one test case on each line follow. The test consists of 3
real numbers a &#62 0, b &#62 0 ir S =&#62 0.
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case you should output one number P and percentage "<code>%</code>"
symbol following that number on a single line. P must be rounded to
6 digits after decimal point.</p>
