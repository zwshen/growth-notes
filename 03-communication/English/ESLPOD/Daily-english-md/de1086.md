This episode is a dialogue between Camille and Aaro n about giving things to your children so that they will behave – so that th ey will not be like my neighbor’s children who are always yelling and screaming. It’s  crazy. Anyway, let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Camille: No, you can’t have a new bike if you get a n A on the test. You should study because you want to do well in school. We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight. Kids! 

Aaron: What’s the matter? 

Camille: My kids won’t do anything without an incen tive. I know it’s my own fault for offering rewards for good behavior, but now all  they want to know is what they’ll get to do what I ask. 

Aaron: Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they? 

Camille: That’s the problem. I feel like I have to bribe them to do the simplest things. I get home from work and I’m tired and fraz zled. I don’t want another power struggle, so I rely on bribes. It’s backfired . 

Aaron: How do you mean? 

Camille: Now my kids won’t do anything without know ing what’s in it for them. And they keep upping the ante. Soon I’ll have to st art forking over cash to get them to behave. 

Aaron: I don’t know what to say. When I was growing  up, my mother put the fear of God into us. We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear  of making her angry. We never got rewards for good behavior. It was just ex pected of us. 

Camille: What’s your mother’s number? Is she availa ble to babysit? 

Aaron: Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think she could in spire that kind of obedience from other people’s children. 

Camille: I’m desperate! At the very least, she can give me a few parenting lessons.

Our dialogue begins with Camille saying, “No, you c an’t have a new bike if you get an A on the test.” Camille is talking to her so n or daughter, we guess. The child has asked his mother if he could get “a new b ike” – a new bicycle – if he gets an A on his test. An A is the highest score th at you can get on a test or an examination or a school assignment. Camille says to  her child, “You should study because you want to do well in school.” In other wo rds, you shouldn’t study just to get a reward, a prize. You should study because you want to be successful in school.  

Camille says, “We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight.” Next we hear from Aaron, who appears to be with Camille – another adu lt who has been listening to Camille talk to her child. Aaron says, “What’s the matter?” meaning “What’s wrong?” What’s the problem? Camille says, “My kids”  – my children – “won’t do anything without an incentive.” An “incentive” (inc entive) is something that motivates you to do something, something that makes  you want to do something else. For some people, an incentive might be money.  They might work harder in order to get more money. The money is an incentive.  

Camille says, “I know it’s my fault for offering re wards for good behavior, but now all they want to know is what they’ll get to do wha t I ask.” Camille is saying that it’s her “own fault,” meaning the blame is on her. She is responsible for this situation. The situation is that her children won’t  do anything without a “reward” (reward). A reward is something you give to someone  – sometimes to thank him or her for doing something for you, sometimes becau se the person has done something that you think is good and you want to en courage them to do it even more.  

Camille has been giving her children rewards for go od behavior. “Good behavior” is when someone acts nice, is polite, does what he or she is told. It’s a term we often use in describing the way children act. Aaron  says, “Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they?” “To use somet hing sparingly” (sparingly) means to use it not very often. If you use, say, sa lt sparingly on your food, you’re only going to put a little bit of salt, not very mu ch, on your food.  

Camille says, “That’s the problem. I feel like I ha ve to bribe them to do the simplest things.” “To bribe” (bribe) means to give someone money to do something that he or she should do anyway. So, for example, if you need to get something from the government, some government offi cials – some people who work for the government – might ask you for some ex tra money to do what they should do anyway. That would be an example of havin g to bribe someone to do something. Camille feels like she has to bribe her children “to do the simplest things.”  

She says, “I get home from work and I’m tired and f razzled.” “To be frazzled” (frazzled) means to be very tired, to be worn out, to not be able to think clearly about something. Camille says, “I don’t want anothe r power struggle, so I rely on bribes.” A “struggle” (struggle) is a conflict, a f ight. A “power struggle” is when you have two people who are trying to control a sit uation, two people who are trying to show that they have the power or the auth ority to control a certain situation.  

Sometimes parents and children have a power struggl e. The child wants to get what he wants, the parent wants to get what he or s he wants, and that results in problems. Camille relies on bribes. She depends on bribes to get her children to do what she wants. However, she says, “It’s backfir ed” (backfired). “To backfire” means to have the opposite effect to what you wante d or planned – to do the opposite of what you think is supposed to happen.  

So, for example, you may want your child to go to b ed at eight o’clock at night. So, you tell the child, “You go to bed right now,” but instead, the child starts crying and crying and complaining, and eventually y ou let the child stay up for another hour. Your plan “backfired.” Instead of get ting the child to go to bed eight o’clock, the child stayed up for another hour.  

By the way, my mother tells me that I was never lik e this as a child. I was, I think her words were, “a perfect child” – an “angel,” she  once told me. Well, I think that’s what she said. Anyway, Aaron says, “How do y ou mean?” “How do you mean?” is a question we use when we don’t understan d exactly what the person is saying – when we want the person to give us more  information or more details.   

 Camille says, “Now my kids won’t do anything withou t knowing what’s in it for them.” The expression “what’s in it for them” (or “ for me”) means the advantage or the benefit that someone will receive because th ey do something. Someone may say to you, “I want you to go to the store and buy me a watch,” and you may be wondering, “Well, why would I do that?” So, you might say to the person, “Well, what’s in it for me?” In other words, what b enefits do I get? That’s what Camille’s children tell her.  

Camille says, “And they,” her children, “keep uppin g the ante.” “To up the ante” (ante) is a betting expression. It’s the amount of money that you bet, say, in poker or in other games before the game begins or a t the beginning of the game. “To up the ante” means to increase it. Here it mean s to increase the risks or increase the rewards for some action. Camille says,  “Soon, I’ll have to start forking over cash to get them to behave.” “To fork (fork) over” some amount of money means to give someone a large amount of money  even if you don’t want to.  

Camille is saying that she has to give her children  money, or she fears she will have to give her children money, to get them to beh ave. Aaron says, “I don’t know what to say. When I was growing up, my mother put the fear of God into us.” This expression “to put the fear (fear) of God ” into someone or in someone means to frighten someone, to make someone scared s o that the person will do what you want him or her to do. That was certainly true with my father.  

Aaron says, “We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear of  making her angry.” “Dare” (dare) means to do something that is very difficult  or challenging – that is not “socially acceptable,” we might say. If you say you  wouldn’t dare do something, you mean that you wouldn’t do it under any circumst ances. In this case, Aaron is talking about not daring to misbehave, to act badly , for fear of making his mother angry. The expression “for fear of” means because o ne is afraid of.  

Aaron says, “We never got rewards for good behavior . It was just expected of us.” Camille then asks Aaron, “What’s your mother’s  number,” meaning her telephone number. “Is she available to babysit?” “T o babysit” (babysit) means to take care of someone else’s child, usually for mone y. Aaron says, “Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think she could inspire that kind of obedience from other people’s children.”  

Aaron is saying that his mother probably can’t help  Camille because she probably could not “inspire that kind of obedience. ” “To inspire” (inspire) means to create a certain feeling, want, or desire in ano ther person. Aaron is saying he  

doesn’t think his mother would be able to make Cami lle’s children obedient. “Obedient” comes from the word “obedience” (obedien ce), which means an agreement to do what someone tells you to do – to f ollow someone else’s orders.  

Camille says, “I’m desperate!” (desperate). “To be desperate” means to want something very badly, thinking that you don’t have any other choices, any other options. Camille says, “At the very least, she can give me a few parenting lessons.” Camille is asking to speak with Aaron’s m other so that “at the very least,” meaning at minimum, Aaron’s mother can give  her some parenting lessons. “Parenting” (parenting) refers to the act of bringing up or raising children, how you treat your children, what sort of  things you say and do with your children. That is part of parenting.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
