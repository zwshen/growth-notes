This episode is a dialogue between Johnny and Franc esca about asking for time off, time where you don’t have to work. Let's get s tarted. 

[start of dialogue] 

Johnny:  I just found out that the manager is letti ng Neal take Friday off. I asked him two days ago for Friday off and he turned me do wn! 

Francesca:  Neal’s wife is pregnant, so maybe he ne eds time off to go with her to a doctor’s visit, or something. 

Johnny:  That’s so messed up! I asked first, so I s hould have been given permission instead of Neal. I think the manager has  it in for me. 

Francesca:  I don’t think that’s the case. Maybe ne xt time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say “yes.” Neal does have s eniority, you know. 

Johnny:  Neal is always going to have seniority ove r me and I’m always going to get screwed. 

Francesca:  Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about  this. Neal put in his years and earned his seniority fair and square. When you’ ve worked here 18 years, you’ll get priority over newer hires. 

Johnny:  If I’m still in this job in 17 years, shoo t me! 

[end of dialogue] 

Johnny begins by saying to Francesca, “I just found  out (I just learned) that the manager is letting or allowing Neal to take Friday off.” “To take a day off” or to take a week off or a month off here is phrasal verb  meaning not to go to work on that day or for that week or for that month. I'm go ing to take the afternoon off. That means I'm not going to work after lunch. Maybe  I won't work before lunch either. I don’t know. That’s what we mean by to tak e something off. That same phrasal verb to take off can also mean to remove yo ur clothing. “I'm going to take off my shirt” – not really, not in front of the mic rophone here! So, to take off means to remove something you are wearing. To take off can also be used for a plane that leaves the ground. “What time does the p lane take off?” What time does it leave? In this dialogue, though, “to take o ff” means simply to not go to work. 

Johnny says, “I asked him (the manager) two days ag o for Friday off and he turned me down.” To “turn down someone” or to “turn  someone down” is another phrasal verb that means to say “no” to something so meone has asked you to do, or that someone has asked you for. “I'm going to tu rn down his request for a vacation next week.” I'm going to say no. To turn d own is usually a verb we use when someone has authority over you, when they're h igher up, have a higher position than you, and usually in a somewhat more f ormal situation. But you could have a parent turn down their son’s request f or the car on Friday night. It's possible to say that as well. 

Francesca says, “Neal’s wife” – Neal is the one who  is getting Friday off – “is pregnant, so maybe he needs time off to go with her  to a doctor’s visit, or something.” “Time off” is a period of time when you  are not working, when you do not have to go to work. So, you could say to your b oss, “I need some time off this afternoon” and your boss might say, “Okay, take thi s afternoon off.” “Time off” is a noun and “to take off,” of course, is a verb. 

Johnny says, “That’s so messed up!” The expression to be “messed” (messed) up is sort of an informal expression to mean it's n ot fair or it's not right. Sometimes perhaps it's just simply confusing. Here Johnny means it's not fair. It's not right. He says, “I asked first, so I should hav e been given permission instead of Neal.” “I should have been given permission.” Wh en we say you should have been something that means that it didn’t actually h appen, but you think that in a perfect world, it should have happened. “Permission ” is authorization. It's when someone in authority, your boss, a parent, a teache r says, “Okay, you can do that.” It is saying it's all right for you to do so mething. Johnny says, “I think the manager has it in for me.” “To have it in for” some one means you want to do something to someone that will make their life mise rable or difficult because you dislike this person. Students often think their tea chers are mean, are not nice,  

that they have it in for them, that they're trying to purposely make their life difficult. 

Francesca says, “I don’t think that’s the case.” Th e “case” (case) here means the situation or the circumstances, the way something i s: “I don’t think that’s the case.” It means I don’t think that’s what is actual ly going on here, I don’t think that is really the situation. Francesca says, “Maybe nex t time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say yes.” To do something “ in advance” means before something else happens, ahead of time, before perha ps other people do it or before something else is supposed to happen. For ex ample, nowadays in the United States, you can buy your movie tickets in ad vance. So, let's say I want to go see a movie this Friday night with my wife and I  decide, hmm, it might be very busy. Sometimes it's so busy you go to the movie th eater and there are no more tickets left. So, I'm going to buy them in advance.  I'm going to go on the Internet and I'm going to buy the tickets today for a movie we're going to see on Friday. That’s just an example. I'm not actually taking my wife to a movie on Friday. I really don’t like going to see movies in movie thea ters. I don’t know if I've ever told you that, but just all the people and they're talking on their cellphones and… just, I would rather just watch a movie on my telev ision honestly. So, that’s me. 

Anyway, Francesca says, “Neal does have seniority, you know.” “Seniority” (seniority) means you usually have been at the comp any for a longer time. I've been working for the company for 10 years. You’ve b een working for the company for one year. I have seniority over you, we  might say. I have been with the company longer. And usually at a company or an organization that means that you have perhaps more power or more influence than people who are younger than you or, not younger in age, but have b een at the company fewer years than you have. 

Johnny says, “Neal is always going to have seniorit y over me and I'm always going to get screwed.” To get “screwed” (screwed) m eans that someone treats you unfairly, that you get a bad result, that someo ne does something bad to you. “Screwed” is a very strong word. It's an informal t erm – many people would probably consider it still a little vulgar, a littl e dirty, so you definitely don’t want to use this with anyone other than your family. I usua lly don’t use this word. It's a pretty strong word. It's definitely not something t o use with your children or with your boss or with anyone that you're not very close  friends with. 

Francesca says, “Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about this.” To get or have a “chip” (chip) on your “shoulder” (shoulder) means t o continue to think about something bad or unfair that has happened to you in  the past and it still affects you in a negative way. Someone was not nice to you two months ago and so  

every time you see that person, you're sort of angr y with them. You're not very nice with them. Some people might say you have a ch ip on your shoulder because that person wasn’t nice to you. 

Francesca says, “Neal put in his years and earned h is seniority fair and square.” “To put in your years” means to do something for a long period of time in order to get some sort of benefit, some sort of advantage. “ Fair and square” means in an honest, fair way, in a truthful way, not trying to trick anyone, not trying to do anything that would be considered cheating or untru thful. Francesca says, “When you’ve worked here 18 years, you'll get priority ov er new hires.” “Priority” means that something is more important than other things or than something else. If you say this has priority over that, you mean that this  is more important than that. So, when Francesca says that Johnny will have priority over someone, she means that just like Neal, he will have seniority over th em and therefore get things before they do. Francesca says Johnny will have pri ority over new “hires” (hires). A hire is a person who is given a job. So, a new hi re is someone who has recently been given a job in your company or organi zation. 

Johnny says, “If I'm still in this job in 17 years,  shoot me!” “If I'm still in this job” means if I'm still working here at this same job in  17 years, Johnny says, “shoot me.” “Shoot me” literally means you're asking someo ne to kill you, to take a gun and point it at you and shoot you. But we use this expression jokingly, sarcastically perhaps, when there's some very unple asant situation that you are in, something very undesirable. So, let's say I los e my job and my cat died. Well, that’s not a bad thing, but let's say my cat died a nd I'm sad and I lost my job and I don’t have any money and I'm telling all this to a friend of mine and I say to my friend, “Oh, just shoot me!” meaning just kill me b ecause my life is so difficult. But we don’t mean it seriously. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Johnny:  I just found out that the manager is letti ng Neal take Friday off. I asked him two days ago for Friday off and he turned me do wn! 

Francesca:  Neal’s wife is pregnant, so maybe he ne eds time off to go with her to a doctor’s visit, or something.

Johnny:  If I’m still in this job in 17 years, shoo t me!
