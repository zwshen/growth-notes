[start of dialogue]

Vera:  That was uncalled for.  You owe me an apolog y!

Alvaro:  Chill out.  It was a joke!

Vera:  It wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.

Alvaro:  Why are you freaking out?  Get over it.  I  was just joking.

Vera:  You really hurt my feelings.

Alvaro:  For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it.  I take it back, okay?

Vera:  You do?

Alvaro:  Yes, I do.

Vera:  And you’re sorry?  You really regret what yo u said?

Alvaro:  I’m sorry you heard my joke.

Vera:  That’s not a real apology.  You owe me a rea l apology.  What you said was cruel.

Alvaro:  I made a joke about you being over the hil l.  You’re clearly not over the hill, so it was clearly a joke.  Okay?

Vera:  Do you really think I’m old?

Alvaro:  No, I don’t.  But you know what you’re doi ng to me right now?  You’re taking years off my life!

Vera and Alvaro are having an argument; they are having a disagreement; they’re not happy with each other.  Vera says, “Tha t was uncalled for.”  We don’t know what Alvaro said, but Vera thinks it was uncal led for.  Something that is “uncalled for” is something that is inappropriate o r unacceptable, something you consider wrong, usually something you consider insu lting.  Vera says, “You owe me an apology!”  “To owe” (owe) someone something m eans that you have to give them something.  You did something, in this ca se wrong, and therefore you must give them an “apology,” a statement saying tha t you are sorry for what you did.  That’s an apology.

Alvaro says, “Chill out.”  “Chill out” is an inform al phrase that’s become popular in the last 20-25 years or so that means to relax, to calm down, don’t be so excited. You have to be careful with this expression; if you  are saying it to someone you don’t know very well it’s often considered somewhat  rude to tell someone to chill out.  However, if you’re good friends with them you  could say it if you thought they were getting too excited about something.  Alv aro says it to his wife, always a bad idea!  He says, “It was a joke!”  Vera says that whatever Alvaro said wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.  “To cross the line”  is an expression meaning to go too far.  Often we say this when someone is perhaps  joking but then says something that is insulting that makes the other pe rson angry.  That’s what Alvaro did, according to Vera.

Alvaro said, “Why are you freaking out?”  “To freak  (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become very upset or worrie d about something, to react to something so strongly that you lose control of y ourself: you start yelling perhaps, or doing something else to show that you a re angry or worried.  “To freak out” is an informal expression.  If you are f reaking out, someone might tell you to “chill out.”  Here, Alvaro thinks that Vera is over reacting, she’s getting more angry than she should.  Then he says something  which I recommend very strongly if you are arguing with your wife or girlf riend, he says, “Get over it.”  “Get over it” is an informal phrase meaning that you sho uld stop thinking about something; stop worrying about something that happe ned in the past and just act

as if nothing had happened, just go on with your li fe.  I’m joking, you would not want to say that if you still want to have dinner a nd sleep in your bed; you would not want to say that to your wife!  “Get over it,” is what Alvaro says to Vera; he thinks that she should just forget about his little  joke.  He repeats, “I was just joking.”  Vera, however, says, “You really hurt my feelings.”  “To hurt someone’s feelings” means to make someone feel bad, usually b y saying something that is insulting or offensive, something that would make them angry.

Alvaro says, “For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it.”  “ For God’s sake” (sake) is a strong expression used to show that you are very fr ustrated, that you think the other person is being unreasonable.  You have to be  careful with that expression and similar expressions that use the name of God or  Christ or Jesus; many people will find those very strong and offensive ex pressions in and of themselves.  That is, the expression itself may cau se them to get more angry, so probably don’t want to use that expression; I never  do.  But at least now you know what it means if you hear or read it.  In any case, that’s what Alvaro says. He says, “I didn’t mean it,” meaning I wasn’t serio usly trying to insult you.  He says, “I take it back, okay?”  When you say, “I tak e (something) back” you mean that you’re sorry for what you said before and you want the other person to pretend that you never said it; it was a mistake.

Vera says, “You do?”  Alvaro says, “Yes, I do.”  Ve ra says, “And you’re sorry?” You feel bad about what happened and you wish that you had not done it.  She says, “You really regret what you said?”  “To regre t” is similar to “to be sorry,” it means to feel bad about something and wish that it had never happened, typically something that you did or didn’t do.  If you have regrets, you have a feeling that you should have done something that yo u didn’t do.  I think all of us have some regrets!

Vera is asking if Alvaro regrets what he said.  Alv aro says, “I’m sorry you heard my joke.”  He’s not sorry for telling the joke; he’ s sorry that Vera heard him say it. Vera says, “That’s not a real (or true) apology.  You owe me a real apology. What you said was cruel.”  “Cruel” means mean, some thing that you say or do to hurt another person.  Alvaro said, “I made a joke a bout you being over the hill.” The expression “to be over the hill” means that you  are old, that you are in the last half or last part of your life; you are no lon ger young, you are past the best years of your life.  That happens sometime around the age of – well, any age old than what I am right now!  Now, Alvaro says, “You’r e clearly not over the hill (meaning it’s obvious that you are not old), so it was (obviously or) clearly a joke. Okay?”  He’s explaining why what he said was meant to be a joke, because even though he said that his wife was getting old – that  she was over the hill, in fact – he didn’t really mean it because she is clearly not  over the hill.  This is another

good way of improving your marriage: tell your wife  that she’s over the hill.  You don’t want to listen to my advice on marriage, trus t me!

Vera says, “Do you really think I’m old?”  Alvaro s ays, “No, I don’t.  But you know what you’re doing to me right now?  You’re taking y ears off my life!”  The expression “to take years off your life” means to s horten your life.  More generally, it means to do something that makes you annoyed, frustrated, perhaps frightened, something that may make you die sooner than you otherwise would have.  Vera, by forcing Alvaro into an apology and by arguing with him is, according to Alvaro, taking years off his life.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Our scriptwriter never freaks out.  That’s because it’s the one and only Dr. Lucy Tse.
