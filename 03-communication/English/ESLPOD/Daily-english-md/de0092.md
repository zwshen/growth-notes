[start of dialogue]

I got a call yesterday from Amy, a co-worker from t he office. She and I work in the same department. We've had lunch at work a few times, but I really didn't know her that well. I was really glad she called.

Kevin: Hello.

Amy: Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?

Kevin: This is Kevin.

Amy: Oh, hi. It's Amy, from work.

Kevin: Oh, hey, how's it going? I didn't recognize your voice.

Amy: Not bad. Listen, the reason I'm calling is tha t I'm having a dinner party a week from Saturday at my place around seven thirty.  I wanted to see if you could make it.

Kevin: So, it's not this Saturday but the Saturday after that. That would be the 17th.

Amy: Yeah, that's right, the following Saturday – t he 17th.

Kevin: Let me just check my calendar. Yeah, I think  I can make it. Are you inviting anyone else from work?

Amy: Yeah, I am. Jennifer from marketing already RS VP’d, so she'll be there for sure, and I'm waiting to hear back from James in ac counting. I've also invited a few other friends.

 Kevin: Just out of curiosity, are they in finance, too?

Amy: No. My friend Janis is in the medical field. S he's an orthopedic surgeon. She's bringing her boyfriend, Tim, and I think he's  an engineer in the automobile industry. Then there's Megan. She works part-time i n retail and moonlights as a tour guide on the weekends. She's been wanting to g et into the hospitality industry for a long time.

Kevin: Wow, that sounds like a great group of peopl e. I'm looking forward to it. Can I bring anything?

Amy: No, that's okay. Just come and bring your appe tite.

Kevin: Sounds great. Thanks for the invitation.

Amy: No problem. I'm glad you can make it. See you in the office tomorrow.

Kevin: See you then. Bye.

[end of dialogue]

We just listened to a telephone conversation betwee n two people who work at the same office, Kevin and Amy. Amy calls up Kevin,  and Kevin answers the phone by saying “Hello,” which is how we answer the  phone in English: “Hello.” “Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?” When you're calling s omeone on the phone, and you don't know if you got the right person, you can  ask, “May I speak to Kevin?” or “Could I speak to Jeff?” or whomever you are try ing to reach.

Kevin identifies himself by saying, “This is Kevin, ” meaning “I am Kevin.” We would not actually say, “I am Kevin,” though. We sa y, “This is Kevin.” Amy says, “Oh, hi. It's Amy from work,” and Kevin replies, “O h, hey, how's it going?” We sometimes use the word “hey” to mean something simi lar to “hi” or “hello.” It's very informal, but you will hear that very often. K evin says he didn't “recognize” (recognize) Amy's voice, meaning he didn't know tha t it was her. Amy invites Kevin to a dinner party. A “dinner party” is a dinn er, but a little more formal dinner – usually a dinner with several people.

The party is going to be “a week from Saturday.” “A  week from Saturday” means the Saturday that comes seven days from the closest  Saturday in the future. So for example, if today is Friday, and you tell someo ne you're going to have a party “a week from Saturday,” you mean not tomorrow, but seven days from tomorrow.

“The following Saturday” is another way we could sa y that. Amy says the dinner party is going to be “at my place.” The word “place ” (place) here means where I live – my apartment or my house. We often refer to where we live as “my place.” “Where is your place?” Well, my place is in Los Ang eles, on the west side.

Kevin says, “Let me just check my calendar.” A “cal endar” (calendar) is a list of days of the month or the days of the week. So, “to check your calendar” means to make sure you have a certain day, or date, avail able. Kevin says that he does. He then asks Amy who else will be at the dinner par ty, and she says that “Jennifer from marketing already RSVP’d.” “Marketin g (marketing) is the part of a company that lets other people know about their pro duct or service. That's part of marketing.

“To RSVP” means to write or to call someone back to  tell them whether or not you are going to be at a party. When you have a spe cial party or some sort of formal event, you will often ask people to RSVP. “R SVP” is a French expression. It stands for “ Répondez s'il vous plaît .” My French is not very good. I apologize to all of our French speaking listeners. But in Englis h, we just say “RSVP,” which we use as a verb. For example, “I RSVP’d to his inv itation” means I responded to his invitation and let him know if I would be at hi s party.

Amy also says she's “waiting to hear back from Jame s in accounting.” “To wait to hear back” means to wait for someone to call you ba ck. James works in accounting. “Accounting” (accounting) is the part o f a company that takes care of the money, for the most part. The accounting depart ment takes care of all the different types of records, taxes, and so forth. the different parts of a big company are called “departments.” James works in ac counting, or in the accounting department.

Kevin then asks “just out of curiosity” if Amy's ot her guests are also in finance. “Curiosity” (curiosity) is your interest in knowing  more about something, and the expression “just out of curiosity” is something we say when we are asking a question that doesn't directly relate to the topic we've been talking about. So, we could be talking about baseball, and you might say,  “Yeah, my uncle recently went to a baseball game,” and I might say, “Just ou t of curiosity, is he your uncle who lives in San Francisco?” My question isn’t exac tly related to what we were talking about, but I just want to know. I am curiou s to know.

Amy is in finance. “Finance” (finance) is the part of a company or a type of company that deals with money. But it's a little di fferent from accounting. “Finance” deals with getting money or with loaning money to a company. That would be the job of someone in finance. Another of Amy's friends is in the

medical field. The word “field” (field) here just m eans a type of work. You can talk about the education field, or the accounting field,  or the medical field. All of those just mean a particular area or type of work. Someon e who works in the “medical field” would be someone who works in a hospital or in a clinic, for example.

Amy's friend Janis is an “orthopedic surgeon.” A “s urgeon” (surgeon) is a doctor who cuts you open to work on you in an operating ro om. That is a room in the hospital where, for example, if you had a heart att ack and needed to have your heart fixed, the surgeon would open up your chest a nd operate on your heart. That kind of doctor is called a “surgeon,” and an “ orthopedic (orthopedic) surgeon” is a surgeon who works on your bones. So, if you broke your leg and you needed surgery to fix it, you would go to an or thopedic surgeon.

Amy says that Janis is bringing her boyfriend, Tim,  to the dinner party, and that Tim is “an engineer in the automobile industry.” An  “engineer” (engineer) is a general term for someone who works in a technical f ield, often involving math and science. The “automobile industry” is the car i ndustry. And “industry” (industry) here means the same as field. It's an ar ea of work, a type of work.

Another of Amy's friends, Megan, “works part-time i n retail but moonlights as a tour guide on the weekends.” The word “retail” (ret ail) has to do with selling things. So when you say, “I work in retail,” it usu ally means that you work in a store that sells things to the general public, like  a grocery store or a department store. A “department store” is a store that sells m any different things, like clothing and electronics and kitchenware.

Megan works in retail, but “moonlights as a tour gu ide.” “To moonlight” (moonlight) – all one word – means to work at anoth er job in addition to your main job. So, I have my regular job working as a te acher, for example, but I want to make some more money, because teachers often don 't get paid very much money, so I might moonlight as a waiter at a restau rant. That's not my regular job. It's an additional job. I guess we use the ter m “moonlight” because it is often a job you do at night when the moon is up.

A “tour (tour) guide (guide)” – two words – is some one who works showing visitors a particular place. It could be in a singl e building. For example, a museum has tour guides who take people around and t ell them what all the things are in the museum. This is especially useful  when you go to a modern art museum, because you can't figure out what it means without them. A tour guide can also be someone who drives you around an entire  city. So, if you come to Los Angeles, you can take a tour, and the tour guid e will be the person who will be telling you everything about the city.

 Finally, Kevin says that he's “looking forward to i t.” “To look forward to” something means to want it to happen. He asksif he can bring anything to the dinner party, and Amy tells him to “just come and b ring your appetite.” When someone says, “Just come and bring your appetite,” it means they don't want you to bring anything to the party, but they want you t o arrive hungry and ready to eat. It's a polite way of saying you don't have to do anything but come and enjoy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a normal speed.
