We’re talking, in this episode, about “story endings,” the way that a movie or a play or a novel might end.  It’s a conversation between H amid and Rachel, and we will use a lot of vocabulary that you might use to d escribe the ending of stories.  Let’s begin.

[start of dialogue]

Hamid:  I just finished a really good book.  I thought the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the  end, and everything turned out well.  It was so satisfying!

Rachel:  It sounds sappy to me.

Hamid:  It wasn’t sappy at all.  It was just a happy end ing.  I know what you like. You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings wher e everyone dies.

Rachel:  At least that would be more realistic than ever yone living happily ever after.  I just saw the series finale of my favorite TV sho w.  You know what they did?  They ended the series with a cliffhanger.  Nothi ng was resolved.

Hamid:  That’s horrible!  How could they leave people h anging like that?  Weren’t you just a little mad?

Rachel:  No, I wasn’t.  The ending stayed true to the spirit of the show.  It was a dark show and the ending was equally dark.

 Hamid:  Well, I bet they ended the series that way so th ey could make a movie sequel.

Rachel:  Yeah, maybe, but I don’t care either way.  Lif e doesn’t end neatly and neither should a good story.

Hamid:  Remind me never to read any stories you write or  any movies you make!

Hamid says, “I just finished a really good book.  I thoug ht the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the end, and everything turned out well.”  To “head toward (somethi ng)” means to advance or to progress toward something, to go in a particular dir ection.  “He is heading toward the door,” he is walking – he is moving in the d irection of the door.  Hamid said the characters, he thought, were headed toward a t ragic ending.  Something that is “tragic” is usually very sad, very unhappy.  Often a person dies when there is a tragic ending.  Hamid said, however, that there wa s a twist near the end.  A “twist,” here, means an unexpected change, something tha t happened and suddenly the story changed completely.  “Twist” has several d ifferent meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide f or some additional explanations.

Hamid says the ending “was so satisfying.”  Something that  is “satisfying,” here, means something that makes you feel good, because you were expecting something good and then something good happens – it wa s very satisfying.  You can also have a meal that is satisfying – food: “Oh, that  was so good, it was very satisfying.  It made me full.”

Rachel says, “It sounds sappy to me.”  “Sappy” (sappy) mean s too emotional, so emotional that it may seem a little silly, a little not  serious.  Hamid says, “It wasn’t sappy at all.  It was just a happy ending.  I know what yo u like.  You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings where everyone di es.”  A “disaster movie” is a movie about some terrible thing that happen s, such as an earthquake, a volcano; usually some sort of natural disast er, but it could be something that is made by man – made by humans.  It coul d be the end of the world.  There was a famous movie that was called in En glish Armageddon  a few years ago; that’s a disaster movie.  Titanic  is, in some ways, a disaster movie, although it was also, I guess, a romance.  I don’t know; I’m one of the four people in the world who never saw the movie Titanic .  Hamid says that these movies have catastrophic endings.  Something that is “catastrophic”  is something that is disastrous; it’s similar to disaster.  The noun would be “ catastrophe.”  Here, the

 adjective is “catastrophic,” very bad, a lot of death, a lo t of suffering, something that is terrible.

Hamid is saying that Rachel likes these disaster movies that have terrible endings.  Rachel defends herself by saying, “At least that  would be more realistic than everyone living happily ever after.”  She says: well, that may be true, but at the very least I can say, in my defense, that these movies w ould be more realistic.  “Realistic,” here, means showing the world as it really is, showing something how it actually is rather than how you might like it to be.  This is, according to Rachel, more realistic than everyone living h appily ever after.  This is an expression; “to live happily ever after” means that e verything ends up being happy; there are no big problems.  Children’s stories – stories for young children usually end “happily ever after,” everything is resolved, e verything is happy – because no one likes to read a sad story, except Rachel, I g uess!

Well, Rachel says, “I just saw a series finale.”  A “series finale” is the last show of a certain television series.  Here in the United States, television dramas can last for years and years, sometimes three years, five years, even 20 years.  But eventually, these television shows – these series are ended ( they’re canceled; they’re stopped) and the last show is always a very importan t one, and everyone who likes the show will watch this “finale.”  The “final e” of something is the last thing, the end of something.

Rachel said she “just saw the series finale of my favorite T V show.”  She’s says, “You know what they did?  They ended the series with a cliffhanger.  Nothing was resolved.”  A “cliffhanger” is a chapter or a televisio n show or a movie that seems incomplete; it leaves people wondering what they wi ll do next, what will happen next.  This is very common for movies that you know  they want to make additional movies about the same topic, so a movie like t he X-Men  or some of the Star Trek  or Star Wars  movies.  These often have cliffhanger endings; something happens but it’s not completely resolved, you’re  not sure what’s going to happen.  This is a very common technique in movies and in television shows and in books.  Rachel says in this cliffhanger nothing wa s resolved.  “To resolve” means to complete, to finish, to decide something: “Th ey resolved their argument.”  They were fighting, they were discussing some thing, and then they resolved it; they came to a conclusion.

Well, this cliffhanger had nothing resolved; there were  still the problems of the series that were remaining.  Hamid says, “That’s horrible !  How could they leave people hanging like that?”  “To leave (someone) hangin g” means to say or do something that makes other people want to have more inf ormation, want to know

 what will happen next.  A “cliffhanger” leaves people h anging; it leaves them waiting for the next episode or the next movie or the n ext chapter or book.

Rachel says that she wasn’t mad.  She says, “The ending stayed  true to the spirit of the show.”  “To stay true to (something)” means to b e consistent with something, not to change your behavior or your action.  To do what one has always done, this is “to be true to (something).”  “Spir it,” here, means the opinions, the actions, the beliefs of a person or a thin g.  When Rachel talks about “the spirit of the show,” she means that the ideas, the  opinions of the show, the way the show was developed, the thought behind it.  Rach el says that it was a dark show and the ending was equally dark.  When we talk about the ending of a story being “dark,” we mean that it is negative; it is myst erious, perhaps even a little evil, a little bad.  That’s “dark.”

Hamid says, “Well, I bet they ended the series that way so  they could make a movie sequel.”  A “sequel” is a continuation of a show or  a movie or a book; it’s like a part two or part three of something.  Many popu lar Hollywood movies have sequels; I mentioned before the Star Wars  movies, there were many different sequels.  There’s also something now called a “prequel,” which is a movie that takes place before the time of the original movie.  Th is has also become very popular; Star Trek  and X-Men  both have had prequels recently.

Rachel says, “Well, maybe, but I don’t care either way,” m eaning I don’t care what happens.  “Either way” is a phrase used to refer to  two options at once, but only one of them will happen.  Somebody says, “We could go to a movies or we could go to the beach,” and you say, “Well, I don’t care either way,” either option – either choice is okay for me.

Rachel explains that life doesn’t end neatly and neither  should a good story. “Neatly,” here, means where everything is taken care of, everything is clean and resolved.  Hamid says, “Remind me never to read any stories you write or any movies you make!”  Hamid doesn’t like the way that Rachel l ikes her story endings; he wants to have happy endings that are resolved.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
