# Simplifying Information

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 900: Simplifying Information.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 900. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful, Los Angeles, California.  

Our website is ESLPod.com. That's been our website for 900 episodes. If you go there, you can become a member of ESL Podcast and g et a Learning Guide for most of those 900 episodes. 

On this episode we’re going to listen to a dialog b etween Tara and Stan about explaining information to people in a simple way. L et's get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Tara:  How is your presentation coming along? 

Stan:  It’s okay, but I’m having trouble simplifyin g some of the key concepts without dumbing them down too much. 

Tara:  I think your instincts are right.  You’ll be  presenting to non-specialists, so it’s important to keep your presentation clear and simple. 

Stan:  That’s my problem.  How do I capture the ess ence of all of this information without making it too simplistic? 

Tara:  My rule of thumb is to think about which con cepts really jump out at me when I think about the topic and identify any patte rns in the information.  Then, I build my presentations around those things. 

Stan:  That’s a good idea.   

Tara:  I would also find a non-specialist and do a run-through and get his or her feedback.  That’s the best way to know if you’ve na iled it. 

Stan:  That’s another good idea.  What do I owe you  for all of this good advice?   

Tara:  There’s a new restaurant across the street I ’ve been meaning to try for lunch...  

 Stan:  Say no more.  Lunch is on me. 

Tara:  Really?  Let’s go right now before you chang e your mind!

Tara begins by saying to Stan, “How is your present ation coming along?” The expression “to come along” means to make progress. It's a phrasal verb meaning to advance toward some goal, to be in the process o f completing something. Tara wants to know how Stan's presentation is comin g along. A “presentation” would be when you give information to someone, usua lly in some sort of formal setting, some formal situation. Stan says, “It's ok ay, but I'm having trouble simplifying some of the key concepts without dumbin g them down too much.”  

“To simplify” (simplify) means to make something le ss complex, to make something easier to understand. A “concept” is an i dea. A “key (key) concept” is your main idea, or your most important ideas. Stan is trying to simplify, or make easier to understand, some key concepts without “du mbing them down.” The expression “to dumb (dumb) something down (down)” m eans to make something too simple, too basic, so that you are changing the  meaning of something in an important way as you simplify it. “To dumb somethin g down” is to lose some important information as you try to make it easier to understand.  

This expression was often used in criticizing Ameri can education in the 1980’s and 90’s. You will still hear it in other contexts,  when people talk about making things too simple in such a way that you are distor ting the reality that is being described. You are not describing accurately becaus e you are trying to make it too simple. 

Tara says, “I think your instincts are right.” “Ins tincts” (instincts) are the reactions that you have or that an animal has that they are t ypically born with. We think of this more when it comes to animals than we do for h umans. When we talk about instincts for humans, we don't necessarily mean it' s something you are born with. It could just mean something that everyone seems to  have, because this is the way that human beings are brought up in a culture o r society. We may talk about a mother's love for her child as being a “maternal instinct” – the idea that a woman who is a mother will naturally want to take c are of her own child. Tara says that she thinks Stan's instincts are correct, not about taking care of children, but about trying to simplify the key concepts.  

She says, “You'll be presenting” – you will be givi ng this information – “to non- specialists.” A “specialist” (specialist) is someon e who specializes in something, someone who's an expert in something. A “non-specia list” would be a person who is not an expert. If you work at a large compan y, for example, you probably have an IT department – an information technology d epartment. Sometimes people from IT departments will be talking to norma l human beings, regular people, and they won't understand that the person t hey're talking to is not a specialist. So, they may use information or they ma y use descriptions that are difficult to understand. A “non-specialist” is some one who's not an expert. 

Tara says, “It's important to keep your presentatio ns clear and simple because these are non-specialists.” Stan says, “That's my p roblem. How do I capture the essence of all of this information without making i t too simplistic?” The “essence” (essence) here means the most important part or the  most important parts. “To capture” (capture) here means to clearly explain, t o make sure that you're including all of the important parts. That's the me aning of “to capture the essence of something.” Stan wants to capture the essence wi thout it being too “simplistic.”  

Something that is “simplistic” is too simple. It's related to the previous expression, “dumbing them down” or “dumbing something down.” Yo u don't want to dumb it down so that it's simplistic. “Simplistic” would be  a description that is not accurate because you are leaving important things out in ord er to try to make it easier for people to understand. When it's simplistic, people are understanding the wrong thing because you're not giving them all the inform ation they need.  

Tara tries to help him by saying that, “My rule of thumb is to think about which concepts really jump out at me when I think about t he topic and identify any patterns in the information.” A “rule of from thumb  (thumb)” means a general guideline, something that isn't an official rule. I t isn't written down, but it's something you use to help you think about a certain  situation. For example, in the kitchen, my rule of thumb is to put the oven at 350  degrees Fahrenheit if I'm not sure how hot the oven should be. That's my rule of thumb. That's what I use when I'm not sure about something. So, a rule of th umb is a general rule that you apply in different situations. Tara says her rule o f thumb in preparing presentations is to think about which concepts real ly jump out at her. The expression “to jump out at someone” means to be the  thing that gets that person’s attention the most, to capture or catch so meone's interest or attention. Something that “jumps out at you” is something that  you notice immediately. It's something that you see is important right away.  

Tara tries to find ideas that jump out at her and h elp her identify any patterns in the information. A “pattern” (pattern) is a repeati ng design or sequence,  

something that you see over and over again. A, A, B , B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, A, B, B, B – that's a pattern, okay? Two A’s followed by three B’s.  

Stan says, “That's a good idea.” He is going to tak e Tara’s suggestion of building his presentation around the things that jump out at  him. “To build a presentation” would mean to construct or to make the presentation . Tara says, “I would also find a non-specialist and do a run-through to get h is or her feedback.” A “run- through” is when you practice something in order to  prepare for some other event. You are going to go through it as a way of p racticing it. It's not the actual presentation. It's something you would do to prepar e yourself. Tara suggests finding someone who is a “non-specialist” and doing  a “run-through” to get his or her feedback or opinion. Tara says, “That's the bes t way to know if you’ve nailed it.” “To nail (nail) something” is an informal expr ession meaning to do it exactly the way you should've done it, to do something very  well.  

Stan says, “That's another good idea. What do I owe  you for all of this good advice?” “What do I owe you?” means “What do I have  to give you as payment?” Tara says, “There is a new restaurant across the st reet I've been meaning to try for lunch.” Tara is suggesting that Stan take her t o lunch to thank her at a new restaurant that she wants to try near where they wo rk.  

Stan says, “Say no more.” This is an expression tha t means I understand what you are saying completely. You don't need to tell m e anything else. “Say no more. Lunch is on me.” When someone says, “Lunch is  on me,” they mean they're going to pay for it. They’re inviting you t o lunch. Tara says, “Really? Let's go now before you change your mind.” “To change you r mind” means to change your opinion, to come to a different decision. Terr a wants to go immediately before Stan changes his mind, changes his opinion a bout taking her to lunch. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

She simplifies without ever making it simplistic. I  speak, of course, of our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.
