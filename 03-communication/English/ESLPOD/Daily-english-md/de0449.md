# Using an Instruction Manual

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 49 – Using an Instruction Manual.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 449.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Using an Instruction Manual.”  It’ s going to talk about some common vocabulary in using common machines and electr onics that you would find in your average home.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Aretha:  Oh, here’s the instruction manual.  I’ll read  you the section on “getting started.”

Carl:  No, you don’t need to do that.  I know how to do the installation.

Aretha:  But don’t you want to hear about the differ ent functions and specifications?

Carl:  There’ll be time for that after everything is h ooked up and we program the machine.

Aretha:  Okay, but the manual says that you shouldn’t plu g in the power supply until you’re done with the installation.

Carl:  I won’t.  Hmm…where is the port for this cord?

Aretha:  Do you want me to look it up in the manual?  There’s a troubleshooting section.

Carl:  No, I can figure it out myself.

 Aretha:  Look at this.  It’s a diagram of the controls a nd this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes.  Do yo u want me to read it to you while you’re hooking it up?

Carl:  No.  Now give me that manual.  I work alone.

Our dialogue begins with Aretha saying, “Oh, here’s the  instruction manual,” the small book that comes with many machines that gives you “instr uctions,” tells you how to use the machine.  Aretha says, “I’ll read the sect ion (or the part) on ‘getting started.’”  Carl says, “No, you don’t need to d o that.  I know how to do the installation.”  “Installation” is when you have to take t he machine and connect it perhaps to another machine or do something with it so t hat it will be ready for you to use.  Some people like to try to do things by themselve s, without the instruction manual; other people like to read the manu al first before trying to connect the machine, or use the machine.  I am one of th ose that likes to read the manual completely before I use something; my wife is the opposite, she likes to just start using it and figure it out on her own.

Aretha says to Carl, “But don’t you want to hear about the different functions and specifications?”  A “function” is something that a machine or a program on a computer does; it’s what it does.  For example, the fun ction of a camera is to take pictures.  Cameras can have special functions for taking p ictures when there isn’t a lot of light in the picture.  “Specifications” refer  to detailed information about a product, usually measurements of some sort: how tall it is,  how wide it is, how much power it uses, and so forth.  Specifications for a co mputer would tell you how much memory it has, how fast the processor is, how big  the screen is if it has a screen, and so forth.

Carl says, “There’ll be time for that after everything is hooked up.”  He’s saying that he can look at the instruction book after he has the  machine hooked up.  To “hook up” a machine is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o connect it, to plug the cables or other connections that it requires.  Usually you need to give it power so you need to connect it to some sort of power so urce, plugging it into the wall, for example, to get electricity.  There are othe r parts of hooking things up.  If you are hooking up a computer, you may connect it to a pri nter or to a monitor (a screen that you can look at).  The verb “to hook up” has se veral different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

 Carl says that they can program the machine.  To “program ” means, specifically for a piece of electronics, to provide instructions to the  machine about how you want it to operate.  For example, if you buy a video re corder you may have to program the time for your local time so that it will r ecord television programs when you want it to.

Carl says that there’ll be time for looking at the manu al after everything is hooked up and we program the machine.  Aretha says, “Okay, but  the manual says that you shouldn’t plug in the power supply until you’re done  with the installation.”  To “plug in” is a two-word phrasal verb, usually referrin g to providing electricity for an electronic machine or device.  So, in most places – houses a nd buildings – there are what we call electrical “outlets” (outlets), and th ose are places where you can plug in a machine.  The actual outlet is different in different countries.  Europe, for example, uses a different kind of electrical outlet t han the United States.  It also uses, in many countries, a different power setting.  So if you try to plug in your machines, say an electronic toothbrush, into a wall i n Europe you might ruin your machine because the electricity is different – the ki nd of electricity that is provided.  This is what I did once when I visited another  country and I ruined my electric toothbrush, so I speak from experience!

The “power supply” is a source of electricity for a piece of  electronics – an electrical machine.  Often, computers will have special “ transformers,” an electrical device that makes sure that the machine is getti ng the exact correct amount of power.  Notice that Aretha is reading the i nstructions and, of course, Carl isn’t interested.  He says, “I won’t,” meaning I wo n’t plug in the power supply until he’s finished with the installation.  Carl then says, “where is the port for this cord?”  A “port” (port) here refers to a small hole wh ere you put a certain cord, cable, or wire into.  It’s the place where you connect a  cable to a machine.  “Port” has a couple of different meanings in English however, so  take a look at the Learning Guide for a complete definition of this wor d.  A “cord” is just another name for a “cable,” a long wire that connects two thi ngs together.  Usually, when we are talking about the power supply, we refer to tha t as the “cord.”  When you plug something into the wall to an outlet, that’s usua lly called the “electrical cord.” The wires that connect different parts of the computer , or your computer to your printer for example, that would be called a “cable.”

Aretha asks Carl, “Do you want me to look it up in the m anual?  There’s a troubleshooting section.”  “Troubleshooting” refers to  giving people help, solving their problems, usually technical problems that they have w ith a machine or a computer program.  Carl says, “No, I can figure it out myself” – I can get the answer by myself; I don’t need the manual.

 Aretha says, “Look at this.  It’s a diagram of the control s and this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes.”  Are tha is showing Carl the instruction manual, and in the manual there is a diagr am.  A “diagram” is a drawing, usually that shows you where things are or whe re things are supposed to go, which cable goes to which port, for example.  T he section in the instruction manual also has illustrations.  “Illustrations,” again, a re a kind of drawing that gives you specific information, a picture of what it is tha t you should be doing with your machine.  A diagram is more like a set of lines tha t show where things are connected.  An illustration is usually something more thre e dimensional, a picture of something.  It is, however, usually a drawing; it’s no t an actual photograph.

Aretha says there are illustrations on how to use the dif ferent modes (modes).  A “mode” is one way that you can use a piece of machinery – a piece of electronic machinery.  Aretha asks, “Do you want me to read it to yo u while you’re hooking it up?”  Carl, of course, doesn’t; he says, “No.  Give me that manual.  I work alone” – I don’t work with other people.  I’m this wa y, as are many people; I find it difficult to work on something such as a computer or a ma chine with someone else trying to help me – I work alone.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
