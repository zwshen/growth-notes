<P>
One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of
pairs of entries that are out of
order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter
sequence ``<TT>DAABEC</TT>'', this measure
is 5, since <TT>D</TT> is greater than four letters to its right and <TT>E</TT>
is greater than one letter to its right.
This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence.
The sequence ``<TT>AACEDGG</TT>'' has
only one inversion (<TT>E</TT> and <TT>D</TT>)--it is nearly sorted--while the
sequence ``<TT>ZWQM</TT>'' has 6 inversions
(it is as unsorted as can be--exactly the reverse of sorted).

<P>

<P>
<BR>
You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences
containing only the
four letters <TT>A</TT>, <TT>C</TT>, <TT>G</TT>, and <TT>T</TT>). However, you want to catalog them,
not in alphabetical order, but
rather in order of ``sortedness'', from ``most sorted''
to ``least sorted''. All the strings are of the same length.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The first line of the input is an integer M, then a blank line followed by
M datasets. There is a blank line between datasets.

<p>The first line of each dataset contains two integers: a positive integer <I>n</I> (
<!-- MATH: $0 < n \le 50$ -->

giving the length of the
strings; and a positive integer <I>m</I> (
<!-- MATH: $0 < m \le 100$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="612img2.gif"
 ALT="$0 < m \le 100$">)
giving the number
of strings. These are followed
by <I>m</I> lines, each containing a string of length <I>n</I>.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each dataset, output the list of input strings, arranged from ``most sorted'' to
``least sorted''. If two or more strings
are equally sorted, list them in the same order they are in the input file.

<P>
Print a blank line between consecutive test cases.
