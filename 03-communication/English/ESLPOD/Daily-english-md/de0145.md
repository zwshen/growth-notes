In this podcast, we heard a conversation between tw o students talking about going to the “Big Game.” And the “Big Game” is usua lly the most important football game at a high school or a university. It’ s usually a game between the team and its most important rival. And a “rival” (r ival) is someone you are competing against. The dialog begins with Mark sayi ng, “On my way home from class, I ran into Cara.” “On my way home” means as I was going home. He was coming, in this case, home from class, from his uni versity or high school class, and he ran into Cara. “To run into someone” means that you meet someone that you weren’t expecting. Cara is a schoolmate. And a “schoolmate” (schoolmate) – all one word – is someone that you go to school wit h – someone in your same school is a schoolmate. Mark says to Cara, “How’s e verything? Long time no see.” “How’s everything?” “How are you?” “How are t hings going?” – all of those are ways of asking about how someone is doing. “Lon g time, no see” is an expression we use when we haven’t seen someone in a  long time. So, literally it’s been a long time since I have seen you.

Cara says that she’s “doing alright” – means she’s okay. Mark says he’s excited about the “Big Game this weekend.” And we talked ab out the big game is usually the most important football game – American footbal l game that is. And Cara doesn’t know about the big game. Mark says, “Are yo u kidding?” meaning are you joking? And that’s an expression we use when we ’re surprised by what someone says or what someone does – “Are you kiddin g?” – means how can you not know? It’s so important or famous, in this case. Well, Mark explains that this is the biggest football game of the season and  the “season” (season) is the period of time, in this case, when you are playing a sport. So, the football season is usually in the fall. And the baseball season is in the summer. So, we use that term – not just to describe the four seasons – Spri ng, Summer, Fall and Winter – but also the seasons of a particular event, when the dates or the months of a particular event.

Well, this is the biggest football game of the seas on and Cara asks who Mark is going with. Mark says he’s going with a big group of friends and then he says, “Hey. You know what?” And that expression – “You kn ow what?” – is something you would say before you are going to tell someone or ask someone a question – often involving some sort of favor or good news tha t you are giving this person. So, for example, in this case, Mark says, “You know  what?” One of his friends is not going to be able to go to the game and he has a n extra ticket. So that’s good

news for that person. That expression “You know wha t?” is used often in front of – when we are about to tell someone some unexpected  good news – usually something we are giving to them or some favor we are doing for them. You can also use this expression simply to call attention to or to indicate to the other person that what you are going to say is important.  And that can be a positive or a negative thing. So, if maybe you’re arguing with someone and you say, “You know what? I’m leaving. I don’t want to talk to you . So, it can be used both in a positive and a negative way.

Well, the favor here is that Mark is going to give Cara a ticket to the big game. The reason his friend cannot make the game – and “t o make the game” would mean to go to the game. He’s not able to make it – that is the game – because he has to go out of town. And to go “out of town” m eans that they have to – the person has to travel somewhere else, to another cit y or another state. That’s a very common expression “I’m going to be out of town . I’m not going to be here in Los Angeles. I’m going to be in Las Vegas losing al l of my money – that is to go out of town. It can be for business or it can be for a vacation. Cara says that she would love to go – I would love to do that. I would  really like to do that. And she says she’s never been to one of the football games before. Mark responds by saying, “Awesome.” “Awesome” (awesome) is the same as that’s great – that’s wonderful news. When you hear something very good a nd you’re very excited, you would say, “Awesome.”

Mark says that there’s a bus picking up students to  go to the game, in front of the dorms at 1 PM. The “dorms” (dorms) is short for dor mitories and a dormitory is a place on a school – usually a university – a colleg e where students live. And dorms are owned by the school. So, most big schools  have dorms where students from other parts of the state or the count ry can live. If they don’t live there in the city. Of course, many students in Amer ican universities also live in apartment buildings and they rent apartments, often  sharing the apartment with one or two or more students. And that is also one w ay to attend a university that is in a different city, or many times, even if you live in the same city as the university – your parents do - students will someti mes get their own apartment when they begin their first year of college. And the difference between a dorm and an apartment, usually – well, first, the dorm is owned by the university. The apartment building would be owned by someone – some  company or some private individual. The other difference is that do rms are usually smaller and they usually don’t have a kitchen. So, you can’t cook fo od in most dorms. Some dorms, you can. Some dorms are more like apartments , but most dorms have no kitchen and so, you have to eat – the school has a big cafeteria – a place where lots of people can eat and they prepare food. So, y ou have to pay for the dorm room but you also have to pay for your food.

 Well, in this case, they are going to pick up stude nts – back to the dialog here – they are going to pick up students in front of the dorms, and Mark says to Cara that she should meet him there at 12:30. Cara says,  “Sounds like a plan.” “Sounds like a plan” means that’s a good idea. And this is an expression we use when – kind of informal expression I guess – when y ou are agreeing with someone, you have decided on a plan – what you are going to do and it’s a way of saying you agree with this plan. “Sounds like a plan” means that’s a good idea, in this case. Mark then says, “Alright. See ya!” “S ee ya!” (ya) means, of course, the same as see you – means I will see you there at  12:30.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
