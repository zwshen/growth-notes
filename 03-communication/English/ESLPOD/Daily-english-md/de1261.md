This dialogue is between Vivian and Eric about read ing the research, the scientific studies, about our health. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Vivian: Wait! Don’t use that toaster.

Eric: Why? I want some toast for breakfast.

Vivian: It isn’t safe. I’ve just read about a resea rch study that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.

Eric: That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with  my coffee.

Vivian: You can’t use the coffee maker, either. The  use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.

Eric: Are you putting me on? Where are you getting this junk science?

Vivian: From very reputable sources.

Eric: I bet these so-called researchers are making sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexistent d ata.

Vivian: Stop!

Eric: What now? I’m opening the refrigerator to get  some milk.

Vivian: Refrigerators emit harmful rays that can be  bad for your vision.

Eric: Wait a second. Are you having trouble sleepin g again?

Vivian: As a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.

Eric: I don’t need any research study to tell me th at people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts!

[end of dialogue]

Vivian begins by saying to Eric, “Wait!” which here  means “stop.” “Don’t use that toaster.” A “toaster” (toaster) is a small machine in the kitchen that heats up bread so that it’s hard on the outside. You, of cou rse, make toast with a toaster. Eric says, “Why? I want some toast for breakfast.” Americans often eat toast with breakfast. Sometimes they’ll make toast and use it for a sandwich, but it’s most commonly eaten in the morning with butter or someth ing sweet on top of it. I like toast with my eggs in the morning.

Vivian says, “The toaster isn’t safe,” meaning it c ould harm you. It could hurt you. She continues, “I’ve just read about a research stu dy that found people who use toasters have higher incidences of tumors.” A “rese arch (research) study” is a scientific paper or publication usually appearing in what we would call a “scientific journal,” which is basically a magazine. A “researc h study” is a report on the results of some scientific investigation, some scie ntific study of a certain phenomenon.

In this case, we’re talking about a research study related to “health” – how your body works, how your body functions. The word “rese arch” can also be used in singular form to refer to a group of studies or lot s of different scientific investigations about a similar topic. People will s ometimes say, “Well, the research says,” meaning the scientific studies indi cate or show that. However, we don’t say “researches.” That is not correct. If you  want to use the plural, you would have to say “research studies.”

Here we’re talking about a single study, just one s tudy, that found that people who use toasters have higher “incidence” (incidence s) of “tumors” (tumors). “Incidence” refers to how often something happens. It’s a word that is often used in talking about disease and health. The “incidence  of cancer” would be how many people or what percentage of people get cancer  in a certain area. A “tumor” is a part of the body that grows unexpected ly, often related to some disease, many times to cancer.

Eric, however, doesn’t think Vivian is correct. He says, “That’s ridiculous. I’m having some toast with my coffee.” “Coffee” is also  a popular drink in the morning. Vivian says, “You can’t use the coffee mak er, either. The use of coffee makers is linked to heart disease.” Vivian is telli ng Eric that he cannot use the machine called a “coffee maker” that he uses to mak e his coffee every morning. Why? Because it is “linked (linked) to” heart disea se. “To be linked to” means it’s connected to or it’s related to. “Heart disease” re fers to medical conditions that cause the heart to have problems, potentially probl ems that could kill you.

Eric says, “Are you putting me on?” “To put someone  on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to fool or trick someone, to deceive s omeone, to make him believe something that isn’t true. Eric thinks Vivian is tr ying to make him believe something that she knows is not true, almost as a j oke. He says, “Where are you getting this junk science?” The term “junk” (junk) normally refers to garbage or trash – things you throw away or get rid of because  you no longer want them or need them. “Junk science,” however, refers to scien ce that is not of a very high quality or that is perhaps not done by people who a re trained scientists.

Vivian says, however, that she’s getting her inform ation from “very reputable sources.” “Reputable” (reputable) means respected, having a good reputation. We might talk about a “reputable car mechanic,” som eone who fixes cars. Someone who is reputable is someone who has a good reputation, someone who is supposed to be honest and qualified. A “sour ce” (source) is where you get information from. Some people use Wikipedia as a so urce of information. Other people get their information from newspapers. These  are “sources.” Some of them are reputable, some of them are less reputable .

Eric says, “I bet these so-called researchers are m aking sweeping conclusions and fraudulent claims based on limited or nonexiste nt data.” Quite a few words and terms to explain in that sentence. Let’s begin with “sweeping” (sweeping). The word “sweeping” here refers to something that is very broad, something that covers a lot of different things. In this case, it’ s used to apply to the word “conclusions.” A “conclusion” is what you believe to be true after looking at different pieces of evidence, different facts. We o ften use the verb “to draw” (draw) with this word “conclusion.” “To draw a conc lusion” means to come to a decision about what is true or not true.

So, a “sweeping conclusion” then would be a conclus ion that covers or includes lots of different things. I may say, for example, that “All coffee makers make bad coffee.” That’s a “sweeping conclusion.” I am makin g a determination about what is true regarding a large number of things. Usually  sweeping conclusions are false; at least, when you hear that expression “swe eping conclusions,” the

person who is using it is probably indicating that the conclusion is false because it is trying to say too much or cover too many case s.

“Fraudulent” (fraudulent) means false, not true. “C laims” (claims) are statements or sentences about what you think is true. So, a “f raudulent claim” would be saying something that you know is false, especially  about a certain product or drug or other thing that is being sold. Eric thinks  these researchers are making “fraudulent claims” – that is, saying things they k now to be false “based on limited or nonexistent data.” “Data” (data) refers to facts  and statistics that are gathered or collected in order to try to reach a conclusion about something.

“Data” technically is a plural noun, although it is  now often used in the singular. The singular of “data” is “datum” (datum), from the  Latin. However, it has become quite common now for people to use “data” as a sing ular noun rather than a plural one. “Data is,” “data are” are both correct forms in English, at least in American English nowadays. “Nonexistent” (nonexiste nt) means it doesn’t exist. It’s not real. There is no, in this case, data. “No nexistent data” would be data that doesn’t exist – things that you basically made up.

Vivian says, “Stop!” Eric says, “What now? I’m open ing the refrigerator to get some milk.” Vivian says, “Refrigerators emit harmfu l rays that can be bad for your vision.” A “refrigerator” is a machine in your kitc hen to keep food cool. “To emit” (emit) means to produce something and send it out to the surrounding area. We talk about a lightbulb “emitting” light – light com es from the bulb and goes out into the area around it. “Rays” (rays) are lines, if you  will, of heat or light that come from a single point. It’s a way we use to describe how light or other electromagnetic fields are transmitted. “Vision” (v ision) refers to your eyesight, your ability to see.

Vivian is saying that refrigerators, according to h er, emit or give out harmful rays that can be bad for your eyesight. Eric says, “Wait  a second,” meaning stop. “Are you having trouble sleeping again?” Vivian says, “A s a matter of fact, I am. I haven’t slept in three days.” Eric now realizes tha t Vivian hasn’t slept for three days, and that’s why she’s saying all of these weir d things. Vivian uses a very common expression, “as a matter (matter) of fact.” “As a matter of fact” is a phrase we use to emphasize the truth of what we are  about to say, especially if we are correcting what another person has said or s imply are adding additional information that we think is important or relevant.

Eric says, “I don’t need any research study to tell  me that people who don’t sleep think kooky thoughts.” “Kooky” (kooky) is a wonderf ul word. It means crazy, weird, unusual, strange. All of those things can be  “kooky.” We usually use it to

refer to a person who has very strange ideas, very weird ideas – unusual ideas that are almost certainly wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed
