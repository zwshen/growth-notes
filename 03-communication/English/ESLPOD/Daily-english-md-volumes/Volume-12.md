On this episode, we’re going to talk about capital punishment – when the government kills someone for committing a crime. So unds happy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Simon: What’s all that?

Hilary: It’s a news report about the upcoming execu tion of Perry Hickock.

Simon: That’s barbaric. We shouldn’t have capital p unishment in this day and age.

Hilary: This guy killed an entire family while trying to rob them in their own home. He was convicted of multiple murders and given the death penalty. This is about justice.

Simon: This is about vengeance. He could have been given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. As it is, he has  spent 22 years on death row.

Hilary: Oh, I see, you’re one those people who is s oft on crime. You think our criminals should be coddled.

Simon: No, I don’t. But aside from my moral objecti ons, executing someone with a lethal injection or the electric chair is inhuman e. Many executions are botched each year.

Hilary: So what? These are people convicted of seri ous crimes. They deserve all the punishment they get.

Simon: I’m going to have to start calling you “Hang  ’em high Hilary.”

Hilary: And I’ll have to start calling you “Soft-he arted Simon.”

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Simon asking Hilary, “What ’s all that?” Hilary says, “It’s a news report about the upcoming execution of Perry  Hickock.” It appears that Hilary is reading the newspaper about an “upcoming execution.” “Upcoming” means in the near future, or simply in the future. An “execution” (execution) is when someone is killed, especially as a punishment for a crime that he or she has committed or done.

Simon says, “That’s barbaric,” referring to the exe cution, of course. “Barbaric” (barbaric) means not civilized, extremely cruel. Si mon says, “We shouldn’t have capital punishment in this day and age.” “Capital” (capital) punishment” is the act of killing someone by a government, usually because  a person has committed a crime. “This day and age” simply means “nowadays” –  in the current time.

Hilary says, “This guy” – the man who is about to b e executed – “killed an entire family while trying to rob them in their own home.”  Hilary is saying that the man who is going to be executed killed an entire family , that means everyone in the family, while trying to rob them. “To rob” (rob) so meone is to steal things from him or her.

Hilary continues, “He was convicted of multiple mur ders and given the death penalty. This is about justice.” “To be convicted” (convicted) means to be found guilty, usually by a judge and/or a jury – a group of people who decide if you are guilty or not of a crime. This person, according to  Hilary, was “convicted of multiple,” meaning many, “murders and given the dea th penalty.” The “death penalty” is the same as capital punishment. It is k illing someone for committing a crime. (The government, of course, killing someone. )

Hilary says, “This is about justice” (justice). How  do we define justice? Well, Socrates, Plato, and other great philosophers have spent a lot of time trying to answer that question, but here it really means some thing that is fair, something that is considered right or correct, something that  is morally or ethically correct. Nowadays it is often associated with the law or law  enforcement. We have, for example, a “Department of Justice” in the United St ates that is responsible for legal issues at a national level for our government .

Simon disagrees with Hilary. He says this is not ab out justice. “This is about vengeance,” he says. “Vengeance” (vengeance) is rev enge. When someone does something bad to you and you do something bad to that person, that is “vengeance” – a kind of revenge. We might also say informally “getting back at” someone. Simon continues, “He” – meaning Perry Hick ock, the killer – “could have been given a life sentence without the possibi lity of parole.”

A “life sentence” is a punishment that puts you in jail for the rest of your life. The word “sentence” here does not refer to a subject an d a verb, but rather the punishment that you get from the government for com mitting a crime. A “life sentence” is when you are sent to prison for the re st of your life. Now, even if you are given a life sentence for doing something terri ble, committing some horrible crime, it is often possible to be released from pri son before you die.

You can also get something called “parole” (parole) . “Parole” is when a prisoner leaves prison, either before or after his sentence is completed. So, if you are given a life sentence, you may, if you act appropri ately in prison and don’t cause any more problems, be given at some point “parole.”

Now why do we have life sentences without parole? B ecause some people think that certain prisoners should never be released fro m prison, and so these people are given life sentences “without parole,” meaning there is no possibility for them to be released from prison in the future, other tha n when they die and are sent out in a coffin. A “coffin” (coffin) is a box that we put a dead body in when we are going to bury the body, put the body in the ground.

Anyway, back to our story. Simon is saying that ins tead of killing this person, they could have given him a life sentence without parole . “As it is,” Simon says, meaning “instead,” “he has spent 22 years on death row.” “Death row” (row) is a part of a prison where people who are awaiting to b e executed are kept. The idea is that they are kept in a different part of the pr ison.

Now, I don’t want to go into the whole topic of cap ital punishment here in the United States. I do want to say, however, that capi tal punishment is legal in some states but not others. So, of the 50 United States,  some of the states have capital punishment, states such as, I think, currently, Tex as. But many states, including California, do not have capital punishment. Instead  of killing the person, they get a life sentence without parole. “Death row,” then, would be a part of a prison where people who are awaiting to be executed are li ving or are kept.

Hilary responds to Simon, “Oh, I see, you’re one of  those people who are soft on crime.” If you are “soft (soft) on crime,” you don’ t believe in punishing a criminal

with a long sentence. You may believe in punishing criminals, but not as much as other people do. It’s a relative term. To say someo ne is soft on crime isn’t really a very meaningful criticism because it just depends o n what your definition of “soft” is.

For some people, being “soft on crime” might be giv ing a prisoner 10 years in prison for a certain crime. For other people, it ma y be giving them 20 years. It just depends on the kind of punishment we’re talking abo ut. Hilary says, “You think our criminals should be coddled” (coddled). “To cod dle” someone is to treat them in a very gentle way, almost as you might treat a y oung child. Simon says, “No, I don’t. But aside from my moral objections, executin g someone with a lethal injection or the electric chair is inhumane.”

Simon has “moral objections” to capital punishment,  meaning he doesn’t believe capital punishment is ethical. It goes against his sense of right and wrong. “Lethal” (lethal) means deadly – something that wil l kill you. An “injection” (injection) is when you or someone else such as a n urse or a doctor puts a needle in your body and puts some sort of liquid in side your body. A “lethal injection” would be an injection that kills you, an d that’s one way that some places carry out capital punishment.

Another way is the use of something called the “ele ctric chair.” An “electric chair” is a chair in which a person is placed, and certain  wires are attached to the person’s body and you turn on the electricity, and that’s how you kill the person. Simon says that both of these methods of capital pu nishment are “inhumane” (inhumane). “Inhumane” means cruel – causing unnece ssary pain and suffering.

Simon says, “Many executions are botched each year. ” “To botch” (botch) something means to do something wrong, to do it in such a way that it doesn’t work or it isn’t done properly. In this case, if an  execution is botched, the person doesn’t actually die, or doesn’t die as quickly as you had planned.

Simon says, “I’m going to have to start calling you  ‘Hang ’em high Hilary.’” “Hang ’em high” is an old phrase used to describe someone  who is enthusiastic about killing someone by hanging them. “To hang” someone is to kill them by putting a rope around their neck and letting them hang in the  air. By calling Hilary “Hang ’em high Hilary,” Simon is criticizing her, saying that she’s too enthusiastic for capital punishment.

Hilary says, “And I’ll have to start calling you “S oft-hearted Simon.” Someone who is “soft-hearted” is someone who doesn’t want t o punish other people or hurt

other people. Once again, Hilary is using this as a n insult, saying that perhaps Simon is too nice to criminals.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Simon: What’s all that?

Hilary: It’s a news report about the upcoming execu tion of Perry Hickock.

Simon: That’s barbaric. We shouldn’t have capital p unishment in this day and age.

Simon: This is about vengeance. He could have been given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. As it is, he has  spent 22 years on death row.

# Sports Tryouts

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,103 – Sports Tryouts.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,103. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Marcela and Kenj i about trying to become a member of a sports team. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcela: All right, you’re ready for these tryouts.  You’ve passed your physical. You’ve trained for months. You’re going to make tha t team.

Kenji: It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk. I’m just  going to do the best I can.

Marcela: Yes, but you want to have your head in the  right place. You’re going to dominate the field. You’re going to intimidate the other players.

Kenji: No, I only want to impress the coach. I’m go ing to play hard and hold nothing back.

Marcela: Yes, that’s fine, but you want to send a m essage to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

Kenji: I’m going to have faith in my abilities and hope for the best.

Marcela: At least try to look tough. Try scowling a t the other players like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them .

Kenji: [sigh] I tell you what, why don’t you scowl for me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game .

[end of dialogue]

Marcela begins our dialogue by saying to Kenji, “Al right, you’re ready for these tryouts.” A “tryout” (tryout) is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to do something. Usually it is something you have to do i n order to become a member of a sports team or perhaps even a musical group. A  “tryout” is when you go in front of sometimes a coach or another judge who dec ides if you are good enough to be a member of this group or this team.

So, a “sports tryout” would involve you going and p laying the sport in front of a group of coaches or in front of a coach who is goin g to decide whether you are good enough to be part of this sports team. Another  word for a tryout that we often use when we’re talking about a musical produc tion or a movie or a television show is “audition” (audition).

Marcela says to Kenji, “You’ve passed your physical .” A “physical,” as a noun, is a medical examination that determines whether you a re healthy enough to participate – in this case, in a certain sport. Chi ldren often get physicals every year or every other year to make sure that they’re growing properly, that they don’t have any physical problems that they need to take care of. Adults should also get a physical once a year or every other year . I know I do.

Marcela says Kenji passed his physical, meaning his  doctor determined that he was good enough to participate in this particular s port. Marcela says, “You’ve trained for months,” meaning you’ve been preparing physically for months. “You’re going to make that team.” “To make (make) a  team” means to be selected to participate in a team, to be chosen as a member of a team.

Kenji says, “It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk.” A  “pep (pep) talk” is a speech that encourages one or more people to do a good job. It’ s a way of motivating someone or a group of people. Sometimes, before a s ports game, the coach of the team will talk to the team and give them a pep talk – try to get them motivated and enthusiastic about going out and winning the ga me.

Kenji says, “I’m just going to do the best I can.” Marcela says, “Yes, but you want to have your head in the right place.” The expressi on “to have your head (head) in the right place” means to be thinking about the right thing – to be focused, to be concentrated on what you are trying to do. It me ans to be psychologically prepared for a certain activity.

Marcela says, “You’re going to dominate the field.”  “To dominate” (dominate) in this sentence means to be better than anyone else, to be the best. Marcela adds, “You’re going to intimidate the other players.” “To  intimidate” (intimidate) means

to scare someone, to frighten someone because you a re stronger or more confident than he is. “Intimidation” is usually a b ad thing.

Here Marcela is saying that Kenji should intimidate  the other players, the other people on the team, in such a way that they are afr aid of him because he’s such a good player, I think is the idea. Kenji says, “No , I only want to impress the coach.” “To impress” (impress) someone is to show s omeone that you have a lot of talent or skill – to have that person think that  you are very good at what you do, to have a person admire you.

A “coach” (coach) is the person who is the head of a sports team, the person who is in charge of telling the players what to do and of making plans for how the team will play. Kenji says, “I’m going to play hard  and hold nothing back.” “To play hard” means to try very hard to win a game or a competition, to put all the effort that you can into winning. “To hold nothing back” is something similar. It means to do something at the maximum level, to do s omething with the maximum effort that you can.

Marcela says, “Yes, that’s fine, but you want to se nd a message to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.” “ To send a message” to someone doesn’t mean to email them, necessarily. It  means to communicate something very clearly to another person or group of people so that there is no possibility of them not understanding. You’re makin g something very clear to them.

Marcela is telling Kenji to send a message to the o ther players. What message? The message that he is “a force (force) to be recko ned (reckoned) with.” If you are a force to be reckoned with, you are someone wh o is too important or too powerful to be ignored. You are a person that the o ther people have to deal with somehow. They can’t ignore you. They have to do som ething about you. Marcela is telling Kenji to act in such a way that the othe r players know that he is a force to be reckoned with.

Kenji says, “I’m going to have faith in my abilitie s and hope for the best.” “To have faith in” something or someone is to believe i n something or someone – to think that this thing or person is real and good ev en if you can’t see it or even if you don’t have all the information that you might n eed to know it for sure. It can also mean to trust in something or someone.

Marcela says, “At least try to look tough” (tough).  “To look tough” means to look strong, to look like you are capable of doing thing s that are very difficult. In fact, we sometimes use this word “tough” as an adjective to mean difficult, but here it

means to look strong. If you say, “That guy looks t ough,” you mean he looks physically strong, maybe big enough to hurt you. My  ex-girlfriend was like that.

Anyway, Marcela says, “Try scowling at the other pl ayers like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them.” Marce la is obviously trying to get Kenji to be tougher. She’s telling Kenji to scowl ( scowl). “To scowl” is to make a mean expression on your face. Often it involves par tially closing your eyes – not closing them all the way, but making this mean expr ession on your face.

“To crush” (crush) means to completely beat or defe at someone. For example, “The Los Angeles Dodgers crushed the San Francisco Giants 10 to nothing in the baseball game yesterday.” That’s just a hypothe tical. If a team wins by a large score, we say the team “crushed” the other te am. That’s what Marcela wants Kenji to do to the other players. Kenji sighs . He makes a sound indicating that he is tired, really, of hearing Marcela give h im advice.

He says, “I tell you what.” “I tell you what” is an  informal phrase used to make a suggestion or to present a new idea for another per son to think about or to consider. You could also say, “I’ll tell you what.”  “I will tell you what.” But the more informal and perhaps a little more common expr ession is “I tell you what.” Kenji says, “I tell you what, why don’t you scowl f or me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game .” Kenji is saying to Marcela that she seems to be tougher and scarier than any of the people who are on the sports team.

Now, we don’t know what kind of sport this is. It m ight be American football. It might be basketball. But in any case, Kenji doesn’t  really want to hear Marcela’s advice and thinks that Marcela should perhaps just go out and try to be the one who scowls and is scary to the other players. I hav e to say, I wasn’t really very big into sports and sport teams when I was in schoo l, although I was on my seventh- and eighth-grade volleyball team. Not exac tly American football, but I thought we were pretty tough.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marcela: All right, you’re ready for these tryouts.  You’ve passed your physical. You’ve trained for months. You’re going to make tha t team.

Kenji: It’s okay. I don’t need a pep talk. I’m just  going to do the best I can.

Marcela: Yes, but you want to have your head in the  right place. You’re going to dominate the field. You’re going to intimidate the other players.

Kenji: No, I only want to impress the coach. I’m go ing to play hard and hold nothing back.

Marcela: Yes, that’s fine, but you want to send a m essage to the other players that you’re a force to be reckoned with.

Marcela: At least try to look tough. Try scowling a t the other players like you can’t wait to get them on the field so you can crush them .

Kenji: [sigh] I tell you what, why don’t you scowl for me? I think you’re much scarier than any player who’s ever played this game .

# Making a Discovery

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,104 – Making a Discovery.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,104. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com or become a member of ESL Podcast. Take a look at our ESL Podcast Special Courses on our webs ite, and you can also check out our ESL Podcast Blog while you’re there.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Pierre and Irene about finding something new – making a discovery. L et’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pierre: How does it feel to be on the cusp of a new  discovery?

Irene: Let’s not jump the gun. We’ve made some majo r leaps forward, but I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.

Pierre: Not yet, but you’re close to a breakthrough . That’s evident.

Irene: I think you might be overstating the case. I f we do make a small breakthrough, it will only contribute to the curren t body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its head.

Pierre: I think you’re downplaying the possible imp act of such a discovery. I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer, a real trailblaz er.

Irene: And your contribution?

Pierre: You know what they say: Behind every great woman is a great man!

[end of dialogue]

Pierre asks Irene, “How does it feel to be on the c usp of a new discovery?” “To be on the cusp” (cusp) of something means to be at the moment when something very interesting is going to happen, to be at the p oint in time where something important or exciting will happen. We often use thi s expression when we’re about

to find out something new or discover something. “T o discover” (discover) is to find out about something that you didn’t know about  before. “Discovery” is the noun that comes from the verb “to discover.”

Pierre asks about a “new discovery,” although anyth ing that is discovered is by definition “new,” at least to the person who discov ers it. Irene says, however, “Let’s not jump the gun.” “To jump (jump) the gun ( gun)” means to do something too soon – to do something before you are ready or before you are prepared, or perhaps simply before you’re supposed to.

When you have a race – when a group of people are r unning, such as at the Olympics – the traditional way of starting the race  is to fire a gun, to make a loud noise with a gun and that begins the race. If you s tart running before the gun makes its sound, you have “jumped the gun.” You hav e gone before you should have gone. We use the expression more generally to mean to do something “prematurely” – before you should or too soon.

Irene says, “We’ve made some major leaps forward, b ut I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.” We’re not sure ex actly what Irene is talking about, but she says that in whatever they’re doing,  they’ve “made some major,” or large, “leaps forward.” A “leap” (leap) is a lon g jump. Here it signifies or means a significant advance in something – to make a lot of progress.

“I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revol utionary,” Irene says. Something that is “revolutionary” is something that  is very exciting, something that will change society in an important way. That’ s one definition of “revolutionary.” “Revolutionary” could also refer of course to the overthrow, sometimes violent overthrow, of a government – the change of a government.

Pierre says, “Not yet,” meaning yes, we haven’t dis covered anything revolutionary yet. “But,” Pierre continues, “you’re close to a breakth rough.” A “breakthrough” (breakthrough) – one word – is a sudden and signifi cant discovery, something that advances your knowledge or your ability to do something significantly. Pierre thinks Irene is “close to a breakthrough.” He says,  “That’s evident” (evident).”That’s evident” means that’s apparent. T hat’s easy to see. That’s obvious.

Irene, however, says, “I think you might be oversta ting the case.” “To overstate (overstate) the case (case)” means to exaggerate, t o describe something as being bigger or more important than it really is. I rene says, “If we do make a

small breakthrough, it will only contribute,” or ad d, “to the current body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its h ead.”

A “body of knowledge” is a certain amount of inform ation or research about a certain area of study. You could talk about the bod y of knowledge in physics. That would include everything we know, basically, a bout physics or perhaps about one specific area of physics. “To turn someth ing on its head” means to change something completely, to change something en tirely. Irene is saying that whatever discovery is made by her, it’s not going t o “turn the field,” whatever area of study she’s working in, “on its head.” It’s  not going to change it completely.

Pierre disagrees. He says, “I think you’re downplay ing the possible impact of such a discovery.” “To downplay” (downplay) means to do or say something that makes something not seem very important or signific ant – to treat something as being less important than it really is. It’s sort of the opposite of “overstating the case.” Pierre says that he thinks Irene is “downpla ying the possible impact” (impact) of a discovery. The “impact” is the influe nce, the consequences.

He says, “I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer , a real trailblazer.” A “pioneer” (pioneer) is a person who does something for the fi rst time or goes somewhere that no one else has been to before. A “trailblazer ” (trailblazer) – one word – means something similar. It’s a person who is the f irst to do something. In addition, a trailblazer is someone who other people  follow, who other people imitate.

Irene then asks Pierre, “And your contribution?” A “contribution” is what you give to someone or something to support the effort, to s upport the goal. Irene is asking Pierre what his contribution to this effort will be considered. How will people think about his contribution to whatever it is that Irene is doing? Pierre says, “You know what they say: Behind every great w oman is a great man!”

This is actually a joke based upon a common phrase,  “Behind every great man is a great woman,” which means that whenever you read about or hear about a man doing something great, there is often a wife or  a woman who is helping that man in some way or at least loving and supporting t he man, typically the husband. Well, Pierre is switching this around. He’ s changing the expression, “Behind every great woman is a great man,” and that ’s what Pierre is saying he will be considered as, we would guess: Irene’s husb and.

The word “behind” (behind) here means supporting or  helping in a way that you can’t see or you don’t notice. So every great man, in the traditional saying, is

accomplishing things, is doing things, with the hel p of a woman. Again, typically a wife. But of course, Pierre is Irene’s husband, and  so he’s the great man behind the great woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pierre: How does it feel to be on the cusp of a new  discovery?

Irene: Let’s not jump the gun. We’ve made some majo r leaps forward, but I’m not sure I’d call what we’ve done so far revolutionary.

Pierre: Not yet, but you’re close to a breakthrough . That’s evident.

Irene: I think you might be overstating the case. I f we do make a small breakthrough, it will only contribute to the curren t body of knowledge in the field, not turn the field on its head.

Pierre: I think you’re downplaying the possible imp act of such a discovery. I think you’ll be recognized as a pioneer, a real trailblaz er.

Irene: And your contribution?

Pierre: You know what they say: Behind every great woman is a great man!

[end of dialogue]

Her scripts are revolutionary in the world of Engli sh language teaching. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse, our scrip twriter.



# Dressing Appropriately for an Event

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,105 – Dressing Appropriately for an Event.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,105. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Special Courses in Business and Daily English.

This episode is a dialogue between Patricia and Ren aud about wearing the right clothes for a certain occasion or event. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Hey, look at you! You’re all decked out. What’s the occasion?

Renaud: I’m going to the Ortegas’ party. Aren’t you ?

Patricia: Yeah, but I’m not getting all dolled up f or it. I think the dress is casual.

Renaud: I heard that it’s going to be an upscale af fair, and I don’t want to be underdressed.

Patricia: But I’d rather not be overdressed.

Renaud: Okay, then what are you wearing?

Patricia: I’m going to dress up these jeans with a chic blouse. And then I’m going to accessorize with this necklace as a statement pi ece.

Renaud: That’s a nice outfit, but it’s more appropr iate for a casual event, not a party.

Patricia: But that’s what I’m trying to tell you. T his is not a formal affair.

Renaud: Do what you like, but I’m not going to risk  being inappropriately dressed for one of the Ortegas’ parties. I don’t want to be  blacklisted and not be invited in the future. Their parties are legendary, with the b est food, the best booze . . .

Patricia: Oh, you’re right. What was I thinking?!

[end of dialogue]

Patricia begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey, look at you! You’re all decked out.” “To be decked (decked) out” means to be wearing ver y nice clothing, to be dressed up. If you’re a girl, it might mean to be w earing makeup and having your hair done a certain way, perhaps wearing certain je welry. Normally “to be decked out” means to be dressed for a formal event, a form al occasion. In fact, Patricia asks Renaud, “What’s the occasion?” meaning what is  the big event? What is the thing that you are dressed up for?

Renaud says, “I’m going to the Ortegas’ party. Aren ’t you?” Patricia says, “Yeah, but I’m not getting all dolled up for it.” “To get dolled (dolled) up” for something means to get dressed up formally. Usually, however,  we use this particular expression when we are referring to a girl or a wom an. A man would not describe himself as getting “all dolled up.” Although I’m no t sure of the exact origin of this expression, the word “doll” used to be used informa lly to refer to a woman, particularly a good-looking woman.

Patricia is not going to get all dolled up for this  party at the Ortegas’. She says, “I think the dress is casual.” “Dress” (dress) here do esn’t refer to a particular kind of clothing that a girl or a woman would typically wea r. It refers to a style of clothing – the kind of clothing that you would wear to a cer tain event or that would be worn by a certain group of people.

So when Patricia says, “The dress is casual,” she m eans that the way people will be dressing for this particular event will be casua l. “Casual” (casual) here is the opposite of “formal.” In other words, it means “inf ormal,” not formal. If you dress “casually” to an event, you are not going to wear y our best clothes. You probably won’t wear a tie if you’re a man or a very nice dre ss if you’re a woman. Patricia thinks the majority of the people, anyway, going to  this party are not going to be dressed formally, but rather casually.

Renaud says, “I heard that it’s going to be an upsc ale affair, and I don’t want to be underdressed.” Renaud has a different idea about  this party. He says that he thinks it’s going to be an “upscale (upscale) affai r” (affair). An “upscale affair” would be a very nice party or event, one for which people would dress very formally. People might also use this expression, an  “upscale affair,” to describe an event where there’s nice food and drinks, where it takes place at a very nice room, such as at a hotel.

Renaud doesn’t want to be “underdressed” for this u pscale affair. “To be underdressed” means to be dressed less formally tha n the people around you. So, if you go to a wedding and you’re wearing short s and a T-shirt and everyone else is wearing a suit and a tie or a nice dress, y ou would be underdressed – you would not be dressed as formally as everyone else.

The opposite of being underdressed is what Patricia  says in the very next sentence, which is “overdressed.” “To be overdresse d” means to, say, go to the beach where everyone else is wearing a swimsuit, dr essed as though you were going to a wedding – in a suit and tie, say. Patric ia says, “But I’d rather not be overdressed.” She prefers not to dress too formally  than to be dressed not formally enough. Renaud says, “Okay, then what are you wearing?” What clothing are you going to put on?

Patricia says, “I’m going to dress up these jeans w ith a chic blouse.” The two- word phrasal verb “to dress up” can mean a couple of different things. Here it means to wear a certain piece of clothing that woul d normally be considered casual and make it look more formal, perhaps by com bining it with something nicer. So for example, a pair of blue jeans would n ormally be considered “casual dress,” but if you wanted to dress it up, you might  wear a very nice shirt with it, or something else that would make it look a little mor e formal. That’s the meaning of “to dress up” here.

“To dress someone up” would mean to put clothing on  someone, usually to make them look like someone else. In that particular mea ning of the phrasal verb, we would usually follow it with “as.” “I’m going to dr ess up as a clown,” meaning I’m going to put on clothing that would make me look li ke a clown. Some people think I look like a clown even without putting on special  clothing.

But Patricia isn’t going to dress up as a clown. Sh e’s going to dress up her jeans “with a chic blouse.” A “blouse” (blouse) is a shir t that a woman wears. The adjective “chic” (chic) means fashionable or stylis h, something that makes it look appealing – in this case, a little more formal. Pat ricia says, “And then I’m going to accessorize with this necklace as a statement piece .” “To accessorize” (accessorize) means to wear other things such as je welry with your clothing to improve the appearance, to make it look better than  it would otherwise.

Accessories include clothing, handbags, purses, sca rves, belts, other things that people wear or use with their clothing to improve t heir appearance. Patricia is going to accessorize with a necklace. She calls the  necklace a “statement piece.” A statement piece is usually a very large, unusual piece of jewelry or other accessory that typically a woman would wear as some thing to improve her look,

her appearance. A statement piece often draws a lot  of attention. It attracts your eye when you look at it.

Renaud says that he thinks what Patricia is wearing  is “a nice outfit.” An “outfit” (outfit) here refers to a set of clothing – things that are worn together at the same time. A woman’s outfit might include a blouse and a  skirt and a belt, perhaps a scarf around her neck – that would all be part of h er outfit. Renaud thinks that Patricia’s outfit is nice. “But,” he says, “it’s mo re appropriate for a casual event, not a party.”

Patricia says, “But that’s what I’m trying to tell you.” “This,” meaning this party, “is not a formal affair.” Renaud says, “Do what you lik e, but I’m not going to risk being inappropriately dressed for one of the Ortega s’ parties.” He’s saying that he’s going to dress the way he wants and he’s going  to ignore Patricia’s advice.

He continues, “I don’t want to be blacklisted and n ot be invited in the future.” “To be blacklisted” (blacklisted) is to be considered no longer welcome at a certain place, or to be “ineligible” – to not be able to ge t a certain job, even. It’s as if your name were put on a list of people who will no longe r be invited to a certain kind of event.

That’s what Renaud is afraid of. He says the Ortega s’ parties “are legendary, with the best food, the best booze.” “Legendary” in  this case means very well known in a positive way – admired or respected. “Bo oze” (booze) refers to alcohol. It’s an informal term for alcohol, or what  we also call “liquor” (liquor).

Patricia says, “Oh, you’re right. What was I thinki ng?!” “What was I thinking” is a phrase used to show that you were wrong, that you h ad the completely wrong idea about something. Apparently Patricia realizes that she is wrong and agrees with Renaud – or at least, that’s the way it seems.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Hey, look at you! You’re all decked out. What’s the occasion?

Renaud: I’m going to the Ortegas’ party. Aren’t you ?

Patricia: Yeah, but I’m not getting all dolled up f or it. I think the dress is casual.

Renaud: I heard that it’s going to be an upscale af fair, and I don’t want to be underdressed.

Patricia: But I’d rather not be overdressed.

Renaud: Okay, then what are you wearing?

Patricia: I’m going to dress up these jeans with a chic blouse. And then I’m going to accessorize with this necklace as a statement pi ece.

Renaud: That’s a nice outfit, but it’s more appropr iate for a casual event, not a party.

Patricia: But that’s what I’m trying to tell you. T his is not a formal affair.

Renaud: Do what you like, but I’m not going to risk  being inappropriately dressed for one of the Ortegas’ parties. I don’t want to be  blacklisted and not be invited in the future. Their parties are legendary, with the b est food, the best booze . . .

Patricia: Oh, you’re right. What was I thinking?!

Her skills as a scriptwriter are legendary. I speak , of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Getting a Flat Tire

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,106 – Getting a Flat Tire.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,106. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about driving your car a nd getting a flat tire. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jaloliddin: What is that thumping noise?

Minisa: I don’t hear anything.

Jaloliddin: I think you have a flat tire.

Minisa: The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I j ust inflated it the last time I was at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine.

Jaloliddin: No, really, I think you need to pull of f to the side of the road.

Minisa: We’re on a busy freeway, but if you insist.

Jaloliddin: Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out, with hardly any tread left?

Minisa: Yeah, well, I’ve been meaning to get a new one. Now what?

Jaloliddin: We need to change it. Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.

Minisa: I think they’re in the trunk, but I don’t t hink I could do it myself.

Jaloliddin: [sigh] Right. I’ll change the tire. Do you have a wrench so I can get the lug nuts off?

Minisa: I have some basic tools in the trunk, too, I think.

Jaloliddin: Put your hazard lights on and I’ll get to work. At least your rim doesn’t look bent.

Minisa: I’m glad to hear that. What should I do?

Jaloliddin: Bone up on basic car maintenance?

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about getting a “flat (flat) ti re (tire).” A “flat tire” is when you have a tire that no longer has any air in it, usual ly because there’s a small hole in the tire. A tire, I guess I should explain, is what  goes around the wheels of your car. Most cars have four wheels, and around the whe els go tires. The tires usually have air in them. If the tires don’t have a ny air, well, then the car will not move very easily.

In our dialogue, Jaloliddin says to Minisa, “What i s that thumping noise?” “Thumping” (thumping) is an adjective used to descr ibe a heavy, loud noise, usually a sound made by something heavy hitting the  ground or something else. In this case, it’s the sound of rubber hitting the road with a flat tire. Minisa says, “I don’t hear anything.”

Jaloliddin says, “I think you have a flat tire.” Mi nisa says, “The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I just inflated it the last time I w as at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine. Minisa doesn’t think she has a problem at all . She does say that “the left rear tire has a slow leak.” A car has front tires i n the – well, logically – front of the car as well as rear tires in the rear or back of the car. There’s a tire on the left and the right side of both the front and the rear of the car.

So the “left rear tire” would be the tire in the ba ck of the car on the left hand side. Minisa says that the tire in the left rear “has a s low leak” (leak). A “leak” is when you have a small hole in something that has either air or liquid in it, that allows the air or liquid to escape, to go out of the conta iner. If a tire has a “slow leak,” as Minisa describes it, it means that air is slowly es caping from the tire, but not so fast that the tire becomes flat.

Minisa says she just inflated the tire the last tim e she was at the gas station. “To inflate” (inflate) in this case means to put air in to something. If your tire is flat, you have to inflate it. You have to put more air into it. We might also say “blow up” the tire. A “gas station” is a place where you buy gaso line for your car. Typically, gas stations also have air pumps, which are machines th at allow you to inflate a tire.

However, Jaloliddin says, “No, really, I think you need to pull off to the side of the road.” “To pull off to the side of the road” means to take your car and park it along the side of a road or a street so that you are not actually on the main part of the road or street. Minisa says, “We’re on a bus y freeway, but if you insist.” Minisa is pointing out that they’re on a freeway, w hich is a special road where people drive fast – at least, if they can.

She says, “But if you insist,” meaning if you absol utely think I must pull off to the side of the road, then I will. At this point, the t wo of them get out of the car to take a look at the tire and Jaloliddin says, “Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out with hardly any tre ad left?” “To be worn (worn) out” means to be used so completely that you can no long er use it. Something that is worn out has to be replaced. It is no longer usable .

Minisa’s tire hardly has any “tread” (tread) left o n it. The tread of a tire is the thick rubber part that actually holds on to, or grips, the road. If you look at a tire, you can see lines in the rubber of the tire, or the mat erial the tire is made of. That’s the “tread.” If you don’t see any lines, if the tir e is basically smooth, we would say that the tire is “bald” (bald). And you don’t want to drive with tires that are bald. That can be dangerous because you won’t be able to stop easily or quickly if you need to.

Minisa says, “Yeah, well I’ve been meaning to get a  new one,” meaning she had been planning on getting a new tire. Then she asks,  “Now what?” meaning “What do we do now?” Jaloliddin says, “We need to change it,” meaning to put a new tire on, or a different tire on. “Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.” Most cars have a “spare (spare) tire,” which is an extra  tire usually kept in the back of the car, in the car’s trunk, that can be used if yo u get a flat tire. A “jack” (jack) is a small tool that is used to lift the car up so you can take one of the tires off and put a new one on.

We call it a “spare tire,” but it’s really a spare wheel and tire. The rubber tire goes around the metal wheel. Minisa says, “I think they’ re in the trunk,” meaning the jack and the spare tire are in the trunk, “but I do n’t think I could do it myself.” A “trunk” (trunk) is the back part of a car, used for  storing things. It’s not a place

where you could actually sit. Well you could, I sup pose, but it wouldn’t be very comfortable. Minisa says, “I don’t think I could do  it myself.”

Now, Jaloliddin follows the statement by sighing, a s though he doesn’t really want to do it either. I guess he’s not a very nice guy, huh? Anyway, he says, “I’ll change the tire. Do you have a wrench so I can get the lug nuts off?” A “wrench” (wrench) is a metal tool that is used to turn small  pieces of metal called “nuts” that are used to hold, in this case, the tire onto the car. A “lug (lug) nut” is what we call the nuts that are used to hold the wheels o nto the car. Minisa says, “I have some basic tools in the trunk, too, I think.”

Jaloliddin says, “Put your hazard lights on and I’l l get to work.” Your “hazard (hazard) lights” are lights on your car that go on and off – that we would say “flash” on and off – to warn other drivers that you  are parked or that there is some sort of problem with your car. We’re guessing that this is Minisa’s friend and not boyfriend or husband, because if it were a boyfriend or a husband and he didn’t seem very enthusiastic about helping his girlfriend or wife, he probably wouldn’t have a girlfriend or wife for much longer.

Anyway, in this case Jaloliddin says, “At least you r rim doesn’t look bent.” The “rim” (rim) is the edge of the wheel. It’s the part  of the wheel that the tire goes around. If something is “bent” (bent), it has an an gle or a curve in it where it shouldn’t. If your wheel is damaged – if you hit it , for example, against the side of the road or against a curb or a rock – you could be nd the rim in such a way that you damage it. The rim should go around in a circle , and if there’s any break in that circle, then we would say the rim is “bent.” I t isn’t in the correct shape.

Minisa says, “I’m glad to hear that,” meaning I’m g lad to hear that the rim of the wheel is not bent. “What should I do?” she asks. Ja loliddin says, “Bone up on basic car maintenance?” “To bone (bone) up on” some thing means to study something for a short period of time – to try to le arn something quickly. What Jaloliddin is saying is that Minisa needs to learn how to change a tire so that she doesn’t rely on other people – namely, him – to do it. I think you need a new friend, Minisa.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jaloliddin: What is that thumping noise?

Minisa: I don’t hear anything.

 Jaloliddin: I think you have a flat tire.

Minisa: The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I j ust inflated it the last time I was at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine.

Jaloliddin: No, really, I think you need to pull of f to the side of the road.

Minisa: We’re on a busy freeway, but if you insist.

Jaloliddin: Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out, with hardly any tread left?

Minisa: Yeah, well, I’ve been meaning to get a new one. Now what?

Jaloliddin: We need to change it. Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.

This episode is a dialogue between a father and his  daughter about a pet that has died.

[start of dialogue]

Dad: Honey, I have some bad news for you. Fluffy ha s gone to the other side.

Sarah: You mean she’s out of her cage again? I’ll g o and try to find her.

Dad: No, you don’t understand. Fluffy passed away i n the night.

Sarah: Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was ge tting up there in years.

Dad: Yes, but she didn’t die a natural death. She w as run over by the neighbor’s car.

Sarah: You mean she was flattened? Cool!

Dad: Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, but I unders tand if you’re in shock. I guess people show grief in different ways . . .

Sarah: Fluffy went out with a bang. That’s the way she would have wanted to go.

Dad: I’d like to think of her as being in heaven an d she’s gone to meet her maker.

Sarah: I don’t think there’s an afterlife for anima ls, Dad. It’s all just a part of the circle of life.

Dad: Okay. I thought we could have a funeral for he r so we can pay our respects.

Sarah: Is that really necessary?

Dad: I’d thought you’d want one. She was your pet, after all.

Sarah: No, let’s just bury her in the backyard.

Dad: And who said that the youth of today is cynica l?

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about one’s “pet” (pet) dying. A pet is an animal that you have usually in your house or near your house. A pet is typically something like a dog or a cat that people like to have. It’s sort of a c ompanion – a friend, if you will. I don’t know. I don’t have any pets. I don’t really l ike animals, but if you’ve been listening to ESL Podcast, you probably know that al ready. Let’s get into our dialogue, then.

We have a father talking to his daughter, Sarah. He  says, “Honey, I have some bad news for you.” “Honey” (honey) is a word we use  for a girl or a woman. It’s what we would call a “term of endearment.” It’s sor t of a nice thing to say to someone. A man may call his wife “honey,” or girlfr iend “honey.” It’s a term of affection used for a woman or a girl. Certainly it’ s something that a father could use with his daughter, and that’s what we see here.

Dad says, “I have some bad news for you. Fluffy has  gone to the other side.” “Fluffy” was either a dog or a cat, I’m not sure wh ich. Let’s call it a cat. I think that’s probably a more likely match, or fit, for the name Fluffy. “Fluffy,” Dad says, “has gone to the other side.” “Gone to the other si de” is just a nice way of saying that someone has died, that someone – or in this ca se, some animal – is no longer living.

Sarah, however, doesn’t really understand her fathe r because “to go to the other side” could mean simply to go, say, from your prope rty to the property next to you – from your house to somewhere else. So she says, “ You mean she’s out of her cage again?” A “cage” (cage) is something that you would keep an animal in. So maybe this isn’t a cat; maybe this is a rabbit or s omething. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Sarah says, “I’ll go and try to find her.”

 Sarah thinks that the animal has escaped from its c age, from the place where she was keeping it. Her father says, “No, you don’t  understand. Fluffy passed away in the night.” The phrasal verb “to pass away”  also means “to die.” It’s much more common to hear someone describe someone d ying as the person “passing away” than it is “going to the other side. ” In fact, I don’t think you would hear the expression “to go to the other side” very often.

People often, however, do say that someone has “pas sed away.” It’s a nicer way of saying someone has died. There are lots of “euph emisms” – nice ways of describing death and the process of dying. In some Christian churches they use the expression “fallen asleep in the Lord,” which I  kind of like – the idea of falling asleep. It sounds a bit more poetic.

Sarah says, “Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was getting up there in years.” The expression “to get up there in years” means to be old – to no longer be young or even middle-aged. Sarah doesn’t seem too u pset – at least, not as upset as her father perhaps thought she would be. D ad says, “Yes, but she didn’t die a natural death.” A “natural (natural) death” i s when you die of some disease or illness or failure of some bodily organ or part,  such as your heart or your lungs.

If it’s not a natural death, then it’s either an ac cident or it’s murder. No, I don’t think Fluffy has been murdered, but that would be r eally interesting in terms of the story. You know what I’m saying? Then I could b e like a detective – the person who tries to find out who murdered, in this case, Fluffy. But no, it wasn’t a murder. It was, however, an accident. Dad says, “Sh e was run over by the neighbor’s car.” “To be run over” means to be hit a nd injured or, in this case, killed by a car that goes over, in this case, the a nimal.

We’re not sure if it was an accident, however. Reme mber, it was the neighbor who was driving the car. Maybe the neighbor was try ing to kill Fluffy. It’s possible. But we continue. Sarah says, “You mean she was flat tened? Cool!” “To flatten” (flatten) something is to make it flat, meaning to make it so that it has very little height. Usually we flatten something with a heavy w eight or object.

But Sarah thinks it’s cool. Sarah thinks it’s kind of interesting, in a good way, that the pet was flattened by the neighbor’s car. Maybe Sarah shouldn’t be owning pets. Anyway, Dad says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it th at way,” meaning I wouldn’t say that, “but I understand you’re in shock.” “To be in  shock” (shock) is to be very surprised by something, usually something negative.

Dad continues, “I guess people show grief in differ ent ways.” “Grief” (grief) are feelings of extreme sadness after someone has died.  Sarah says, “Fluffy went out with a bang.” “To go out with a bang” (bang) is  to die doing something exciting, unusual, surprising, and/or memorable in some way. I really don’t care about going out with a bang. I’d rather just not go  out – that is, die. But we all have to, don’t we? Sarah says, “That’s the way she would have wanted to go,” meaning that’s the way Fluffy would have wanted to die – assuming animals could want something in the same way that we want s omething.

Dad says, “I’d like to think of her” – I’d like to imagine her – “as being in heaven and she’s gone to meet her maker.” “Heaven” (heaven ) in many religions is a place where God lives, where you go after you die o r where you may go after you die. According to the theologians in the rock group  the Bangles, “Heaven Is A Place on Earth,” but I don’t think many people beli eve that. The expression “gone to meet your maker” (maker) means that you have die d. It’s another way of saying someone has died and has gone on to meet God . God here being the maker of the world and of all things.

Sarah says, “I don’t think there’s an afterlife for  animals, Dad.” An “afterlife” (afterlife) is a state that your soul is in after it dies. It’s the idea that you have a soul or spirit that continues living on, or it coul d simply refer to whatever happens to you after you die, whatever continued existence you have. Sarah says, “It’s all just part of the circle of life.” The phrase “circl e of life” is sometimes used to talk about the natural processes of birth, life, and dea th.

Dad says, “Okay, I thought we could have a funeral for her so we can pay our respects.” A “funeral” (funeral) is a ceremony that  you hold after someone dies, often intended to honor the person who has died – t o give friends and family a chance to talk about the person, perhaps, or rememb er the person. “To pay your respects” (respects) – notice it’s plural – means t o honor someone’s memory or to remember someone in a nice way by actually going  to his or her funeral.

Sarah says, “Is that really necessary?” Dad says, “ I thought you’d want one,” meaning I thought you would want a funeral for Fluf fy. Dad says, “She was your pet, after all.” But Sarah says, “No, let’s just bu ry her in the backyard.” “To bury” (bury) is to put a dead body into a hole in the gro und and cover it with dirt. Usually you put the body in some other container, s ome sort of box, which for a human body we would call a “coffin” (coffin).

Dad is a bit surprised by Sarah’s attitude. He says , “And who said that the youth of today” – that is, young people today – “is cynic al” (cynical). “Cynical” in this case means not interested in commonly accepted stan dards and behaviors. It

can also be used to describe someone who is self-in terested, who is looking after his own interests before other people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dad: Honey, I have some bad news for you. Fluffy ha s gone to the other side.

Sarah: You mean she’s out of her cage again? I’ll g o and try to find her.

Dad: No, you don’t understand. Fluffy passed away i n the night.

Sarah: Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was ge tting up there in years.

On this episode, we have a dialogue between Sydney and Isaac about exchanging money when you travel. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Sydney: Where should we go on our honeymoon? I thou ght Rome would be nice.

Isaac: Let me check. No, that wouldn’t be a good id ea.

Sydney: Okay, how about Tokyo? I’ve always wanted t o visit Japan.

Isaac: No, I’m afraid not.

Sydney: How are you making these determinations?

Isaac: I’m checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a  favorable exchange rate with those currencies. We want our dollars to go as far as they can.

Sydney: You mean you want to pick our honeymoon des tination according to the currency market.

Isaac: I’m just saying that we should take advantag e of falling currencies or ones that have already depreciated significantly. A stro ng dollar means we can get more bang for the buck.

Sydney: So you’re saying that you want us to make p lans at the whim of the Federal Reserve and central banks.

Isaac: Well, I wouldn’t go that far. I’m only sayin g that it would make financial sense.

Sydney: That doesn’t seem like a very romantic way of picking a honeymoon destination.

Isaac: Romance is overrated. Wouldn’t you rather be  solvent than sentimental?

Sydney: I’d rather be solvent and  sentimental.

[end of dialogue]

Sydney asks Isaac, “Where should we go on our honey moon?” Your “honeymoon” (honeymoon) is the vacation you take af ter you get married. Usually, but not always, it’s immediately after the  wedding. Sometimes people take their honeymoon later. The honeymoon is suppos ed to be, of course, a wonderful time for the married couple, and often the last wonderful time they have. I’m just kidding, of course. Marriage has hap piness beyond the honeymoon. It often lasts another month or two.

Sydney suggests they go to Rome – Rome, Italy, of c ourse. Isaac says, “Let me check” – let me investigate. “No,” he says, “that w ouldn’t be a good idea.” Now, we’re not sure what Isaac is checking when he says,  “Let me check.” We’re not sure what he’s investigating in order to say yes or  no. Sydney then gives him another suggestion. She says, “Okay, how about Toky o?” – Tokyo, Japan, of course. “I’ve always wanted to visit Japan,” she sa ys. Isaac says, “No, I’m afraid not.” “I’m afraid not” is just another way of sayin g no. It’s a little more polite.

Sydney then says, “How are you making these determi nations?” which is, of course, a very good question. A “determination” is a decision or an assessment – how you decide one way or another. Isaac says, “I’m  checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a favorable exchange rate with those cur rencies.” So, Isaac is making this determination based upon the exchange rate. the “exchange rate” is basically the amount of money that you get when you , in effect, buy another country’s money, another country’s currency.

“Currency” (currency) refers to the system the mone y that is used in a particular country. In the United States, we use dollars. But if I’m going to go to Europe, I would in many countries need to exchange my dollars  for euros. I would need, basically, to buy euros. A “favorable exchange rate ” is when you can get a lot of money in the other country for the money in your co untry. So, a favorable

exchange rate between say the U.S. dollar and the e uro would mean that I could get a lot of euros for my dollar. And as we record this in 2015, that is true.

Isaac, then, is making his decision about where he and Sydney should go on their honeymoon by looking at the exchange rates. H e says, “We want our dollars to go as far as they can,” meaning we want to get as much for our money as possible. Sydney is not very happy when she lear ns this. She says, “You mean you want to pick our honeymoon destination acc ording to the currency market.”

Sydney is saying that Isaac wants to “pick” (pick),  or select, the honeymoon location based on the currency market – the price of different currencies. A “market” is usually a word we use to describe the s ystem or the mechanism for people to buy and sell things. So, the “currency ma rket” would be buying and selling of currencies, of different kinds of money.  Isaac says, “I’m just saying that we should take advantage of falling currencies or o nes that have depreciated significantly.”

For a currency to “fall” means that it has become l ess expensive or less valuable. “Falling” here refers to decreasing – becoming smal ler or lower. We could talk about the stock market falling. That would mean tha t the price of stocks was going down. Isaac thinks that they should select th eir honeymoon location based on the state of the currency in that country. He al so mentions “depreciated currencies.” The verb “to depreciate” (depreciate) means to lessen in value or worth, to be worth less money – at least that’s wha t Isaac means here.

He says, “A strong dollar means we can get more ban g for the buck.” A “strong dollar” would be a dollar that keeps its value, tha t is expensive relative to other currencies. The phrase “bang (bang) for the buck (b uck)” refers to getting a lot for your money. “Buck” refers to money here, American m oney. We refer to one dollar as a “buck.” “To get a lot of bang for your buck” means to get a lot for your money, to get a very good value. Sydney says, “So, you’re saying that you want us to make plans at the whim of the Federal Reserve  and central banks.”

The expression “at the whim (whim) of” means based on some rather unpredictable idea of another person or organizatio n. We have a related expression, “on a whim,” which means to do somethin g without thinking about it closely or carefully. So to be “at the whim of” som eone means that your future – things that are important to you – depend on someon e else’s decision, someone else who may not make a decision very rationally or  might make a decision arbitrarily – without any good reason for it.

Sydney is saying that their plans depend on the dec isions of the Federal Reserve and the central banks. The “Federal Reserve” is the  national bank of the United States. A “central bank” of a country – or in the c ase of the European Union, of the E.U. – is the bank that helps determine and reg ulate the monetary system for that country or that area or region. The central ba nk typically decides how much money it’s going to print. Here in the U.S. that wo uld mean how many dollars will be available in the economy.

Isaac disagrees with Sidney’s description of his ap proach to planning their honeymoon. He says. “Well, I wouldn’t go that far,”  meaning that’s partially true, but not as much as you are saying. He says, “I’m on ly saying that it would make financial sense” – it would make economic sense for  the two of them. Sydney, however, says, “That doesn’t seem like a very roman tic way to pick a honeymoon destination.” Something that is “romantic” (romanti c) is something related to feelings of love toward another person – an express ion of that love.

Then Isaac says something very stupid, very foolish . He says, “Romance is overrated.” To say something is “overrated” (overra ted) means that people think it’s more important than it really is, more signifi cant than it actually is. You would never want to say that to your girlfriend, wife, or  in this case, fiancé – the woman who is going to marry you. Isaac says, “Wouldn’t yo u rather be solvent than sentimental?”

“To be solvent” (solvent) means that you have enoug h money to pay for your expenses. You have enough money to live on. You hav e enough money to pay your bills. “Sentimental” (sentimental) refers to a  person who is strongly influenced by feelings and perhaps is basing their decisions more on feelings than on reason, than on intellect. Isaac says, “Wou ldn’t you rather be solvent than sentimental?”

He’s saying that there is this choice: either you can be solvent – either you can spend money wisely – or you can be sentimental; you  can be guided by your feelings. Sydney doesn’t think you have to choose b etween these two options. She says, “I’d rather be solvent and  sentimental,” which I think is true, of course. You can pay your bills and still follow your heart.  Now that’s romantic.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sydney: Where should we go on our honeymoon? I thou ght Rome would be nice.

Isaac: Let me check. No, that wouldn’t be a good id ea.

Sydney: Okay, how about Tokyo? I’ve always wanted t o visit Japan.

Isaac: No, I’m afraid not.

Sydney: How are you making these determinations?

Isaac: I’m checking to see if the U.S. dollar has a  favorable exchange rate with those currencies. We want our dollars to go as far as they can.

Sydney: You mean you want to pick our honeymoon des tination according to the currency market.

Isaac: I’m just saying that we should take advantag e of falling currencies or ones that have already depreciated significantly. A stro ng dollar means we can get more bang for the buck.

Sydney: So you’re saying that you want us to make p lans at the whim of the Federal Reserve and central banks.

Isaac: Well, I wouldn’t go that far. I’m only sayin g that it would make financial sense.

Sydney: That doesn’t seem like a very romantic way of picking a honeymoon destination.

Isaac: Romance is overrated. Wouldn’t you rather be  solvent than sentimental?

Sydney: I’d rather be solvent and  sentimental.

# Reading Poor Handwriting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,109 – Reading Poor Handwriting.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,109. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. On it, we have some Spec ial Courses in Business and Daily English that I think you’ll like. You can  buy and download these right away. We don’t sell books. We don’t sell CDs. We se ll immediate and instant downloads. Check out our website for more informati on.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Lily and Hassan about handwriting – you know, using your hand to wr ite on a piece of paper. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lily: Can you make out what this says?

Hassan: Geez, who wrote that?

Lily: My doctor. She wrote down some instructions f or me, but I can’t read her handwriting.

Hassan: I have no idea what that chicken scratch sa ys.

Lily: I think that’s a “T,” but maybe it’s an “F.”

Hassan: Face it. Those scribbles are illegible. Why  don’t you take a photo of that and email it to her nurse? Maybe she can decipher it for you.

Lily: I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be abl e to work it out.

Hassan: Patients shouldn’t have to try and read a d octor’s sloppy writing. What if they misinterpret it and do the wrong thing as part  of their treatment?

Lily: This note isn’t that bad. I think I might hav e the first two words figured out already.

Hassan: Then you’re better at reading bad penmanshi p than I am. Maybe you should have a try at these English essays. I have 6 0 of them to grade.

Lily: Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have 60 fu ture doctors in the making!

[end of dialogue]

Lily asks Hassan, “Can you make out what this says? ” The phrasal verb “to make out” (out) here means to be able to understand some thing that someone has said or that someone has written, to be able to read som ething. If, for example, you pick up something and you’re trying to read the ser ial number – the numbers that come on an object to identify it, especially an ele ctronic object – usually the serial numbers are written with very small print. They’re not very large, and so they’re difficult “to make out.” They’re difficult to read.

Hassan says, “Geez, who wrote that?” “Geez” (geez) is a word used to express surprise, or amazement, or perhaps annoyance – when  something bothers you. Hassan is asking Lily who wrote this note or messag e that she’s trying to read. Lily says, “My doctor.” This is a bit of a joke, of  course. At least in the United States, doctors have the reputation of having very poor “handwriting” – that is, the writing that they make with a pen or a pencil w ith their hands. Lily says her doctor wrote down some instructions for her, but sh e can’t read her handwriting.

Hassan says, “I have no idea what that chicken scra tch says.” The term “chicken scratch” (scratch) is an informal one referring to handwriting that is very difficult to read – that is very, we might say, “sloppy” (slo ppy). If something is “sloppy,” it’s not neat and organized. It’s not done with car e. If someone described your handwriting as “chicken scratch,” he or she is bein g somewhat insulting, saying that your handwriting is very sloppy, almost as if a chicken had written it. I don’t know why a chicken. That’s just the expression.

Lily is trying to read the note. She says, “I think  that’s a ‘T,’ but maybe it’s an ‘F.’” Lily is pointing to different letters on the piece of paper, trying to guess what they are. Hassan says, “Face it. Those scribbles are ill egible.” The expression “face (face) it (it)” is used to tell someone that he or she needs to recognize the truth of what one is saying. It’s usually used when someone is trying to deny something that is obviously true, or that perhaps the person knows is true but doesn’t want to admit.

Hassan says, “Those scribbles are illegible.” “Scri bble” (scribble) as a verb refers to writing something down quickly. “Scribbles” as a  noun would refer to writing that was done very quickly and not carefully. The t erm “illegible” (illegible) means

impossible to read, usually because the handwriting  is very bad. Hassan says, “Why don’t you take a photo of that and email it to  her nurse?” Hassan is suggesting that Lily take a photograph and email th at photograph to the nurse of her doctor. “Maybe she” – assuming now the nurse is  a woman – “can decipher it for you.”

“To decipher” (decipher) means to be able to unders tand the meaning of something that has been written in another code or system or even language. “To decipher” something means to figure it out, to be able to understand it. Governments, for example, often communicate using s pecial secret codes that no one else can understand. These are codes, of cou rse, that the country’s enemies try to decipher, try to figure out.

Hassan is referring to the doctor’s writing, not so me special secret code. He recommends getting the doctor’s nurse to decipher it. Lily says, “I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be able to work it out.” A couple of common expressions there. The first one is “to keep at it.” “To keep at it” or “t o keep at” something means to continue to do it even though it is difficult or ch allenging. It’s the opposite of giving up. If you give up, you stop. You quit. If y ou continue working on it even though it’s difficult, we would say you are “keepin g at it.”

Lily uses another very common expression: “to work something out.” “To work something out” is to find the answer to some questi on or solution to some problem that is very difficult, that is very challe nging. “To figure something out” is “to work it out.” “To work it out” usually involves  a very complicated problem. If, for example, you like to read detective fiction – n ovels about private investigators and police who investigate crimes – you might be so meone who likes to work out the solution, who tries to figure out who committed  the crime, who committed the murder.

There are lots of, of course, famous writers of det ective fiction in English. People like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers from the ea rly to mid part of the twentieth century, and of course many, many others.  I personally love watching detective shows. I’ve watched probably thousands of  them. I love watching a good mystery and trying to work it out. I never do,  of course. My wife works it out like halfway through the show, and I am always surp rised at the end and she’s already worked it out a long time ago. She’s much s marter than I am, of course.

Anyway Hassan says, “Patients shouldn’t have to try  and read a doctor’s sloppy writing.” We talked about “sloppy” earlier on as be ing not very carefully done. “What if they,” meaning the patients, “misinterpret  and do the wrong things as part of their treatment?” “To misinterpret” somethi ng is to misunderstand

something, to come to the wrong conclusion. If a pa tient misinterprets the doctor’s instructions, they could be doing the wron g thing in terms of their treatment. “Treatment” refers to medical care – thi ngs that you or your doctor does to make you feel better, to get better physica lly.

Lily says, “This note isn’t that bad. I think I mig ht have the first two words figured out already.” “Figured out,” of course, means under stood. Hassan says, “Then you’re better at reading bad penmanship than I am.”  “Penmanship” (penmanship) is just another word for handwriting. You don’t hea r the word that often anymore now that we live in a world of computers and textin g. In fact, some parents complain that the schools no longer teach good penm anship anymore the way they did back when they were young. My school taugh t us good penmanship. The problem is I never really learned it. They trie d to teach me, but I was never very good at it.

Hassan says, “Maybe you should have a try at these English essays.” It appears that Hassan is a teacher and he has to read some ha ndwritten essays. An “essay” (essay) is a short written document, often done as part of a school assignment. The teacher will tell students to write  several paragraphs in order to demonstrate their knowledge of a certain topic. Thi s is often done on a test that is given to the class. Hassan says that he has 60 of t hese essays “to grade” – to give a score to as the teacher.

Lily says, “Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have  60 future doctors in the making!” Lilly is making a joke. She’s saying that all of Hassan’s students have bad handwriting, have poor handwriting, which must mean that someday they will become doctors. That’s why she says “60 future doct ors in the making.” If something is “in the making,” it is in the process of being made or formed. It’s not finished yet – it’s not in its completed form yet –  but it is in the process of being completed.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lily: Can you make out what this says?

Hassan: Geez, who wrote that?

Lily: My doctor. She wrote down some instructions f or me, but I can’t read her handwriting.

Hassan: I have no idea what that chicken scratch sa ys.

Lily: I think that’s a “T,” but maybe it’s an “F.”

Hassan: Face it. Those scribbles are illegible. Why  don’t you take a photo of that and email it to her nurse? Maybe she can decipher it for you.

Lily: I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be abl e to work it out.

Hassan: Then you’re better at reading bad penmanshi p than I am. Maybe you should have a try at these English essays. I have 6 0 of them to grade.

Lily: Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have 60 fu ture doctors in the making!

Our scriptwriter’s handwriting is never sloppy. Tha t’s because she’s always very careful. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. L ucy Tse.

# Experiencing a Drought

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,110 – Experiencing a Drought.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,110. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode. What is  a Learning Guide, you ask? Well, it is an eight- to ten-page guide we provide that gives you a complete transcript of everything we say here on the episode , as well as a vocabulary list, definitions, sample sentences, cultural notes, and a whole lot more.

This episode is a dialogue between Fabian and Lia a bout not having enough water where you live – what we would call a “drough t.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Fabian: How long do you think this drought is going  to last?

Lia: I have no idea, but I’m not worried. I grew up  in the desert. Not having enough precipitation was just a fact of life.

Fabian: Yes, but people here aren’t used to getting  this little rainfall. Their livelihood depends on having a reliable water suppl y for their crops.

Lia: You make it sound like we’re experiencing anot her Dust Bowl when the water table is just a little low.

Fabian: I think it’s a little more serious than tha t.

Lia: What we need here is a reservoir. That would g ive this town the water reserves it needs in case of a drought.

Fabian: What we really need are fewer dust storms a nd more thunderstorms.

Lia: And for people to stop over farming. That and deforestation are half the problem.

Fabian: You may be right, but that’s not what peopl e want to hear right now. They need some relief.

Lia: Maybe the town’s water conservation efforts wi ll make a difference.

Fabian: Well, I’m certainly willing to stop bathing  if it’ll help.

Lia: I thought you already had.

[end of dialogue]

Fabian asks Lia, “How long do you think this drough t is going to last?” How long will it be? A “drought” (drought) is a very dry per iod of time with little or no rain. Here in California, we have a history of droughts. In fact, as I record this episode, we are in the middle of another drought – a long pe riod of time with little or no rain. Lia says, “I have no idea,” meaning I don’t k now how long this drought will last. “But,” she adds, “I’m not worried. I grew up in the desert.” The “desert” (desert) is a hot, dry area with little or no rain.

She says, “Not having enough precipitation was just  a fact of life.” “Precipitation” (precipitation) refers to water in any form that fa lls from the sky, from clouds. That would include rain, snow, and “hail” (hail), which is basically small little balls of frozen rain. Lia says not having enough precipitati on was “a fact of life” for her, meaning it was a reality. It was just something you  had to deal with when she was growing up.

Fabian says, “Yes, but people here aren’t used to g etting this little rainfall.” “Rainfall” (rainfall), one word, is the amount of r ain – which in the U.S. is usually measured in inches – that falls from the sky during  a certain period of time. Fabian says, “Their livelihood depends on a reliabl e water supply for their crops.” Fabian is talking about the people in the area wher e he lives, who are apparently farmers – people who grow things and sell them.

Well, Fabian says that the “livelihood” of the peop le in this area depends on having “a reliable water supply for their crops.” “ Livelihood” (livelihood) is how you make money, how you earn money to live. In an a rea that has a lot of agriculture, a lot of “crops” (crops) – which are p lants that are grown for food or to make other products – you need a lot of water. That ’s why Fabian says that they need a “reliable,” that is dependable, “water suppl y” – something that will give them the water they need.

Lia responds, “You make it sound,” meaning you make  it appear, you make it seem, “like we’re experiencing another Dust Bowl wh en the water table is just a little low.” The term “Dust Bowl” (bowl) refers to a specific period of time in the 1930s in the United States, when there was a drough t in the middle part of the United States, causing a lot of people who lived th ere to leave. In fact, many of the people who lived in this area moved to Californ ia in order to find work. Lia is saying that the situation now is not like the Dust Bowl. It’s not that bad.

She says, “The water table is just a little low.” T he “water table” (table) refers to the water that is below the surface of the ground –  how deeply below the ground the water is found. Lia is saying it isn’t really a  serious drought. Fabian disagrees. He says, “I think it’s a little more serious than t hat” – that is, than how you are describing it, Lia. Lia says, “What we need here is  a reservoir.” A “reservoir” (reservoir) is a large area used to hold or store w ater that is used by a town or a city. Many cities have reservoirs. Los Angeles has a couple of reservoirs, but apparently where Lia and Fabian live, there is no r eservoir.

Lia says, “The reservoir would give this town the w ater reserves it needs in case of a drought.” “Reserves” refers to a supply of som ething that is being stored for use in the future, especially in a situation where you may not have enough of something. The United States used to (perhaps it st ill does) have something called “oil reserves,” where the country would stor e a certain amount of oil in case there was a crisis or an emergency in which we  couldn’t get enough oil for our needs. Lia is proposing something like that for  water.

Fabian says, “What we really need are fewer dust st orms and more thunderstorms.” A “dust storm” is a period of time when you have a lot of very strong wind that is blowing or carrying a lot of di rt and dust through the air. Usually we associate dust storms with a very dry ar ea. “Thunderstorms” are storms where you have a lot of rain that comes down , often in a very short amount of time. “Thunderstorms” also produce loud n oises called “thunder.” Fabian thinks the area needs more rain. Of course, we already know this.

Lia says, “And for people to stop over farming.” “T o over farm” would be to try to grow similar kinds of plants, similar kinds of crop s, in a certain area that might be bad for the soil, for the dirt. Lia is suggesting t hat the farmers have to change their practices. Lia also says that “deforestation”  is part of the problem. “Deforestation” (deforestation) has, in the middle of it, another word, “forest” (forest). A forest is an area with many trees. So, “deforestation” is cutting down those trees. Apparently Lia thinks that that is par t of the problem in terms of having enough water in the area.

Fabian says, “You may be right, but that’s not what  people want to hear right now” – that’s not what people want you to tell them . “They need some relief” (relief). “Relief” can mean a couple of different t hings. Here, it means a period of time after a very bad experience, when the experien ce stops. When the pain stops, for example, you get a period of relief when  you no longer hurt – or in this case, no longer have a bad situation.

Lia says, “Maybe the town’s water conservation effo rts will make a difference.” “Water conservation” refers to efforts to use less water in your home, in your place of business, in farming, and so forth. The wo rd “conservation” comes from the verb “to conserve” (conserve) which means to sa ve something or to prevent it from getting worse.

Fabian says, “Well, I’m certainly willing to stop b athing if it’ll help.” “To bathe” (bathe) means to clean your body. Fabian is suggest ing that maybe he should stop bathing himself. Lia makes a joke and says, “I  thought you already had,” meaning I thought you already had stopped bathing, because perhaps she is jokingly saying that he smells or that he looks dir ty.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fabian: How long do you think this drought is going  to last?

Lia: I have no idea, but I’m not worried. I grew up  in the desert. Not having enough precipitation was just a fact of life.

Fabian: Yes, but people here aren’t used to getting  this little rainfall. Their livelihood depends on having a reliable water suppl y for their crops.

# Symptoms of Depression

Welcome to English is a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,111 – Symptoms of Depression.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,111. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Courses in Business and Daily English. You can also like us on  Facebook at facebook.com/eslpod. And why not follow us on Twitt er at @eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue between Emily and Shivan  about symptoms or signs of depression. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emily: I think Jackson is depressed.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: Well, he’s been suffering from a loss of app etite and is generally lethargic.

Shivan: Have you noticed any other symptoms?

Emily: He seems to have trouble concentrating and h as insomnia.

Shivan: Um, really?

Emily: Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal tho ughts. He seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’s not his us ual self.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: What do you mean?

Shivan: I mean, he looks the same to me. He just sw ims back and forth in the fish tank.

Emily: Just look at him. He’s on the edge of mental  collapse!

Shivan: Somebody is.

[end of dialogue]

Emily begins by saying to Shivan, “I think Jackson is depressed.” “To be depressed” means to have feelings of extreme sadnes s and what we might describe as “hopelessness,” like you can’t see a po ssible good outcome for your situation. “Depression” is the noun form of the ver b “to be depressed.” Shivan says, “How can you tell?” The phrase “how can you t ell” (tell) is used to ask someone to explain how they know what they know, wh at evidence they are using, what are the indications that they are seein g that would lead them to this conclusion.

Emily says, “Well, he’s been suffering from a loss of appetite and is generally lethargic.” “To suffer from” something is to experi ence a problem from some situation, often an injury or an illness. We say pe ople suffer from diseases. “He suffers from malaria.” He has the disease of malari a, and he’s feeling the negative effects of that disease. Emily says that J ackson is “suffering from a loss of appetite” (appetite). Your “appetite” is your in terest in food, your feeling hungry for food. So, a “loss of appetite” would be a lack of interest in food – when you don’t feel hungry.

Jackson is also, according to Emily, “lethargic” (l ethargic). “Lethargic” is an adjective describing someone who doesn’t have a lot  of energy, who seems very tired or perhaps simply isn’t interested in the wor ld around him. Shivan says, “Have you noticed any other symptoms?” A “symptom” (symptom) is a physical condition that is a result of, or a consequence of,  an injury or an illness.

So if you have, say, the flu – influenza – one of t he symptoms might be a fever, a high temperature that indicates or tells you that y ou are sick. Shivan is asking Emily if she has noticed any other indications or s ymptoms that Jackson is depressed. Emily responds, “He seems to have troubl e concentrating and has insomnia.” “To concentrate” means to focus your att ention on something without being distracted.

“Insomnia” (insomnia) is the inability to fall asle ep or to remain asleep. Someone with insomnia is often up late at night because he cannot sleep. In fact, insomnia really means the inability to sleep. It could be ca used by many different things – that is to say, it could be a symptom of many diffe rent kinds of illnesses or problems, or maybe you’re just drinking too much co ffee at night. Although usually the cause is more serious. Emily says that Jackson is having “trouble

concentrating and has insomnia.” Shivan says, “Um, really?” Emily says, “Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal thoughts.”

The word “suicidal” (suicidal) relates to having th oughts about wanting to kill yourself, about wanting to end your own life. Emily  says that Jackson “seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’ s not his usual self.” “To be distant” (distant) means to seem as though you aren ’t really connected to the person you’re talking to, or you’re not perhaps eve n paying attention to the person you’re talking to, or you’re very reserved e motionally. You’re not indicating your feelings or emotions to the other p erson. All of those could be described as being distant.

“To be distracted” (distracted) means not being abl e to concentrate or focus because you’re thinking about something else. If yo u are sitting at a café, talking to your wife or girlfriend, and a beautiful woman w alks by, you might get distracted. You might look over at the beautiful wo man instead of listening to your wife or girlfriend. This is a very, very bad idea, guys, because she will notice and, well, let’s just say your life will be a little les s happy that day. So, “distracted” is usually a condition that you do not want to be in. It’s usually a bad thing.

Now, sometimes when people are feeling sad or somet hing bad happens, you want to be distracted – that is, you don’t want to concentrate on the bad thing. You want to be distracted by something else, so it can sometimes be a good thing, if what you are being distracted from is a b ad thing. So you may think being distracted from your wife or girlfriend is a good thing, and your wife or girlfriend might think something else.

Anyway, back to our story. Emily describes Jackson as “staring off into space.” “To stare” (stare) means to look at something for a  long time, to focus on something. “To stare off into space” means to look out at nothing in particular, to seem to be thinking about something and not focusin g on anything that you’re actually looking at. So, it’s an interesting expres sion.

Normally, “to stare at” something means to focus on  something. But if we say someone is “staring off into space,” we mean a pers on is looking in a certain direction or looking at something – it seems. His e yes are open, but he’s not actually focusing on anything physical, if you will . He’s thinking about something else. Another verb we might use here is “to daydrea m” (daydream). “To daydream” means to be thinking about things in a di stracted way, rather than what you should be thinking about.

Emily finally says that Jackson is “not his usual s elf.” Your “usual (usual) self (self)” is the way you normally act, is the way you  normally behave. If someone says, “He’s not his usual self,” we mean he’s actin g strangely. He’s acting differently from the way that we would expect him t o act. Shivan says, “How can you tell?” Once again, the same expression: How do you know? Emily says, “What do you mean?”

Shivan says, “I mean he looks the same to me. He ju st swims back and forth in the fish tank.” All this time, we think that Shivan  and Emily are talking about a human being being depressed – but no, it seems as t hough they’re talking about a fish. Many people like to keep fish in their hous es in a container called a “fish tank” (tank). Fish tanks are usually made of glass so that you can see the fish swimming back and forth.

Now you see, I think fish would be one pet that I m ight enjoy because you don’t really have to do anything for the fish. You don’t have to take the fish for a walk. You have to clean up after the fish a little bit, I  guess, and feed the fish, but really, fish don’t really require a lot of work. I think it’s the kind of animal that I might enjoy having in my house. Well, Emily and Shi van apparently have a fish, and they’re worried that the fish is depressed.

Emily says, “Just look at him. He’s on the edge of mental collapse!” “To be on the edge” (edge) of something means to be almost in tha t situation – almost in that condition but not quite. “Mental” (mental) refers t o your mind. “Collapse” (collapse) is when something either falls down or b reaks down or no longer works the way it should. “Mental collapse” would be  someone who is no longer able to think rationally, who we might say “loses h is mind.” “To be on the edge of mental collapse” means that you are almost in that situation where you are no longer able to think rationally.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Emily: I think Jackson is depressed.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: Well, he’s been suffering from a loss of app etite and is generally lethargic.

Shivan: Have you noticed any other symptoms?

Emily: He seems to have trouble concentrating and h as insomnia.

Shivan: Um, really?

Emily: Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal tho ughts. He seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’s not his us ual self.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily: What do you mean?

Shivan: I mean, he looks the same to me. He just sw ims back and forth in the fish tank.

Emily: Just look at him. He’s on the edge of mental  collapse!

Shivan: Somebody is.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,112 – Doing Impressions.

This episode is a dialogue between Edison and Kay a bout imitating someone else’s voice. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Edison: [in a high-pitched woman’s voice] “I’m payi ng you less and working you harder. What are you complaining about?”

Kay: Ha, ha. You sound just like Justine! You reall y have a gift for doing impressions, but maybe we should shut the door.

Edison: Oh I’m not worried about Justine hearing me . She’s my boss, but she’s not the boss of me.

Kay: What would she say if she saw you imitating the way she walks and the gestures she makes?

Edison: We all know what they say: Imitation is the  highest form of flattery. Right?

Kay: I’m not sure Justine would see it that way. It  sounds more like mockery to me. I think it’s all in the tone.

Edison: It’s a simple parody of how she normally ad dresses the staff. It’s all done in good fun. It’s not mean-spirited.

Kay: Of course not, but she might take it the wrong  way.

Edison: Then she would need to learn to laugh at he rself. It’s healthy for the ego.

 Kay: “Whatever you say, boss. You’re always right, boss.”

Edison: Who was that supposed to be?

Kay: Remember what you said about imitation being b e the highest form of flattery . . .

Edison: That was supposed to be me? Me?!

[end of dialogue]

Edison begins our dialogue speaking in a high-pitch ed voice.” A “high-pitched (pitched) voice” is a voice that sounds very high. We normally associate a higher- pitched voice with a woman and a lower-pitched voic e with a man. So, “high-” and “low-pitched” are the terms that we use. Edison , who is a man, speaks in a high-pitched voice in order to imitate, or sound li ke, another person at his job. He says, “I’m paying you less and working you harder. What are you complaining about?” He’s pretending as though he were this othe r woman by the name of Justine.

Edison is pretending that Justine is asking him wha t he is complaining about. “To complain” (complain) is to talk about things you do n’t like about something, the problems with something. It could be your meal at a  restaurant. It could be your job. It could be just about anything. Some people l ike to complain. They like to talk about the negative aspects of things or they l ike to tell other people about these problems in the hopes that they will be fixed .

Kay laughs at Edison’s imitation of Justine’s voice . She says, “You have a gift for doing impressions, but maybe we should shut the doo r.” “To do impressions” (impressions) is to imitate someone’s voice, usuall y to be funny, usually as entertainment. There are many famous comedians who imitate other famous people in order to make a joke about those people. Some people are very good at imitating, or sounding like, another person – th at is, some people are very good at doing impressions.

Kay thinks, however, that she and Edison should shu t or close the door so that, presumably, their boss doesn’t hear them making fun  of her. Edison, however, says, “Oh, I’m not worried about Justine hearing me . She’s my boss but she’s not the boss of me.” This is an interesting phrase. “No t the boss (boss) of me” is used to assert your independence, to say to someone  that that person doesn’t

have authority over you. A “boss” is a person who i s a manager, who is in charge of you at your workplace.

The expression “not the boss of me,” however, can b e used in pretty much any context where one person is trying to tell another person what to do, as if the person had authority. You might say to your brother , “You’re not the boss of me” if your brother tells you how to act or behave. For  some reason, Edison recognizes that Justine is his boss, but says that she’s not the boss of him, perhaps meaning that he can make his own decisions even though she is the boss.

Kay says, “What would she,” meaning Justine, “say i f she saw you imitating the way she walks and the gestures she makes?” Doing im pressions is usually related to imitating, or copying, someone’s voice, but you may also copy a person’s gestures. “Gestures” (gestures) are the mo vements that you make with your body, especially your hands.

Edison says, “We all know what they say: Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Right?” There’s an old expression: “Imitation is the highest” – or best – “form of flattery” (flattery). The “form of” something is a kind of something, a type of something. “Flattery” is when you tell another pers on how good they are in order to make them feel good, but often in order for the person to do you a favor or to get the person to do you a favor.

The expression “imitation is the highest form of fl attery” – or “the best form of flattery” – refers to the idea that if you copy som eone else, you’re not doing it because you want to steal something from him or her ; you’re doing it almost as a compliment to that person, to say, “See, you’ve don e such a great job, I’m going to do the same thing.” And in doing that, I am prai sing you in a way. I am telling you how good you are at what you did. Of course, if  you are doing impressions of another person in order to make fun of that person,  it is very unlikely that person will consider what you are doing “flattery.”

But back to our story. Kay says, “I’m not sure Just ine would see it that way.” She doesn’t think that Justine would agree with Edison that this is a form of flattery. Kay says, “It sounds more like mockery to me. I thi nk it’s all in the tone.” “Mockery” (mockery) comes from the verb “to mock” ( mock), which means to make fun of someone in a cruel, mean way – to imita te someone in a way that makes them look bad or that makes fun of them, that  we might also say “ridicules” them.

Kay is saying that Edison’s imitations and impressi ons are going to be interpreted by Justine as a mockery. She says, “I think it’s al l in the tone” (tone). The “tone,” when referring to your voice, refers to the qualiti es of the voice, including whether it’s high-pitched or low-pitched, whether there is warmth, whether there is strength. It’s the particular way in which your voi ce sounds when you are saying something.

We all know that you can say something to someone t hat would make the person mad or happy depending on the tone. For example, if  you said to your girlfriend, “Oh, you’re crazy,” you say it in such a way that y ou’re kidding or joking and your girlfriend knows it. But if you say to your girlfri end, “You’re crazy,” your girlfriend will probably have a different reaction because you ’re using a different tone in your voice.

Edison says, “It’s a simple parody of how she norma lly addresses the staff.” A “parody” (parody) is an imitation of a person, but usually involves some sort of exaggeration in order to be funny. Normally, we thi nk of this word “parody” as it relates to some performance on a television show or  in a movie where they’re making fun of something in a way that exaggerates it.

So, for example, if a politician normally scratches  his head when he talks, a parody of that perhaps would be a comedian who stan ds up and takes both hands and moves them up and down on the sides of hi s head in order to make fun of this politician. The comedian is exaggeratin g it. He’s trying to imitate the person in a way that would be funny. Parody doesn’t  involve just physical actions – it can also be the language you use.

Edison says his impressions of Justine are “a simpl e parody,” or exaggeration for comic effect, “of how she normally addresses,” or t alks to, “the staff” – the people who work at the company. “It’s all done in good fun . It’s not mean-spirited,” he says. “To do something in good fun” is to do someth ing funny without being mean, without trying to hurt someone. The opposite of “in good fun” would be, in fact, “mean-spirited.” Something that is “mean-spir ited” is something that is unkind or cruel, something that is funny but also n ot very nice.

Kay says, “Of course not,” meaning of course you’re  not doing this in a mean- spirited kind of way, “but she might take it the wr ong way.” “To take something the wrong way” is to understand something in the wr ong way, especially in a way that makes you feel offended or angry. It means “to  misinterpret” something, to take something the wrong way.

If someone says to you, “Wow, what happened to all of your hair?” Well, you might take that the wrong way. You might think the person is making fun of you because you are bald. I’m not sure what the right w ay to take that would be, however. Maybe there are some things you say that can only be taken one way, no matter how the person says it. Anyway, Edison says that Justine “needs to learn to  laugh at herself.” “To laugh at yourself” means to find things that you do funny , especially mistakes that you make.

Edison says, “It’s healthy for the ego.” Your “ego”  (ego) is your sense of self- confidence, self-respect, how you believe yourself to be as a person. Kay says, “Whatever you say, boss. You’re always right, boss. ” That’s Kay imitating someone. Edison says, “Who was that supposed to be? ” Kay says, “Remember what you said about imitation being the highest for m of flattery?”

Kay is obviously trying to imitate Edison and show him that sometimes doing impressions of other people are not funny and they don’t take them to be funny. They don’t take them as a form of flattery. Edison says, “That was supposed to be me? Me?!” He doesn’t think that Kay’s impression  is very funny. Of course, Kay is trying to show him that making fun of other people by doing impressions of them can often be considered mean-spirited, even if  you think it’s all in good fun.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Edison: [in a high-pitched woman’s voice] “I’m payi ng you less and working you harder. What are you complaining about?”

Kay: Ha, ha. You sound just like Justine! You reall y have a gift for doing impressions, but maybe we should shut the door.

Edison: Oh I’m not worried about Justine hearing me . She’s my boss, but she’s not the boss of me.

This episode is a dialogue between a mother and a f ather who are trying to get a picture taken of the entire family. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places.

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer ju st take the photo?

Dad: We have to pose. The whole point is to look na tural.

Mom: If you wanted a natural family photo, why are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting?

Dad: I want us to stand in front of a nice backgrou nd and pose with nice props. I’m tired of looking at the photos that we take. Th ey’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative cropping.

Mom: Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearin g color-coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses.

Dad: Don’t be like that. Generations to come will c herish this family photo.

Mom: I doubt it.

Dad: How about if I ask the photographer to take so me shots just of you?

Mom: You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars ge t?

Dad: Uh, sure, if that’s what you’d want.

Mom: Well, in that case, I’ll need to have my hair cut, get my makeup done, and buy a new outfit . . .

Dad: What have I gotten myself into?!

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Having a Family Portr ait (portrait) Taken.” A “portrait,” in this dialogue, refers to a photograph. Usually w hen we talk about having a portrait taken, we’re talking about having a photog raph in usually some sort of formal setting, or when you are wearing very nice c lothes. It’s a photograph that might be used for putting on your wall, or even in some cases for giving to other people as a gift. In the old days, before cameras, people had portraits painted of them, but most people don’t have painted portraits.  They have portraits that are photographs.

Dad begins by saying, “Okay, everybody, take your p laces.” “To take your place” means to sit or stand where you’re supposed to for some sort of performance or show, or in this case, for taking a photograph. Dad  is telling everyone to take their places – to go where they’re supposed to go. The mother says, “We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer just take the ph oto?” The “photographer” is the person whose job it is to take photographs.

Dad says, “We have to pose.” “To pose” (pose) is to  hold your body in a particular position, especially so that you can be photographed or painted. You put your body in a certain position and someone pai nts you in that position, or in this case, takes a photograph of you. Dad says, “Th e whole point is to look natural.” “The whole point” means the main purpose of something, the reason you are doing something.

Of course, this is a little funny because if you are posing, you’re really not doing something naturally. To do something natural would be not to pose, not to put your body in a particular fixed position in order t o have a photograph taken of it. Mom says, “If you wanted a natural family photo, wh y are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting?” Mom has a good point h ere. She’s telling Dad that they don’t need to go to a portrait studio in order  to get a natural look to their photograph.

A “portrait studio” would be a place you go to get your photograph taken for some formal event, usually. Only professional photograph ers typically have portrait

studios – places where people can go and get their picture taken. Portrait studios often have special lighting and backgrounds that are used as part of the process of taking the portrait. A “sitting” (sitting) is a period of time when you sit in front of a camera or an artist in order to have your paintin g made or your photograph taken.

Dad says, “I want us to stand in front of a nice ba ckground and pose with nice props.” A “background” is what is seen behind you. And as I just mentioned, portrait studios or photo studios often have specia l backgrounds special pieces of paper or material that look like mountains or field s or something that you stand in front of in order to have your photograph taken. Da d wants a nice background with nice “props” (props).

A “prop” is an object that is usually used for a pe rformance such as a play, but it could also be used in a photo session – that is, wh en you are taking photographs of someone, such as in this case. A prop is any phy sical object that would be used as part of a performance or in what we might c all a “photo shoot” (shoot), which is a session or a period of time when many ph otographs are taken of a person.

Dad says, “I am tired of looking at the photos that  we take. They’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative croppi ng.” “To touch up” a photograph is to improve it by making small changes  to it. Nowadays, of course, with programs such as Photoshop, people are able to  change photographs, often making them look nothing like the original photogra ph – the actual thing that was photographed, or person. “Cropping” (cropping) refe rs to cutting the top, bottom, or sides of a digital photograph so that you elimin ate certain things that were in the original photo.

Mom says, “Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearing color-coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses.” Mom is so rt of making fun of Dad here. She’s saying that they don’t look very natural if t hey’re wearing color-coordinated clothing. “Color-coordinated” means that the clothe s, the colors of the clothes, somehow match – that they look good together. Mom, of course, is saying that this isn’t very natural looking. Dad says to Mom, “ Don’t be like that.” “Don’t be like that” is what you say to someone who you think is m aking fun or is behaving in a way that you don’t like.

Dad says, “Generations to come will cherish this fa mily photo.” The expression “generations (generations) to come” refers to peopl e in your family who are younger than you, or who will be born in the future  – “future generations,” we might also say. “To cherish” (cherish) means to adm ire something and to value it,

to think it’s very important, to think it is worthy . What Dad is saying is that in the future, his children and their children and their c hildren will cherish this photo. They will think it very valuable.

Mom says, however, “I doubt it.” She doesn’t think so. Dad says, “How about if I ask the photographer to take some shots just of you ,” meaning a photograph just of the mom. Mom says, “You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars get?” A “headshot” (headshot) is a photograph of just your neck and your head. It doesn’t include the rest of your body. This is very popular  here in Los Angeles, here in Hollywood, where actors and actresses try to get jo bs in the television industry or the movie industry or in modeling, and they have a photograph made of themselves.

We call that photograph of their head their “headsh ot.” I personally don’t have a headshot. The funny thing is when you go to restaur ants here in Los Angeles, you can look up on the wall and most of them, even restaurants that aren’t very good quality, will have headshots on the wall of ac tors and actresses who’ve eaten there. Usually the photograph, the headshot, is signed by that person. Sometimes they’re famous people, sometimes they’re people that you’ve never heard of before. Anyway, Mom is asking if she can h ave a headshot made of herself.

Dad says, “Uh, sure if that’s what you want.” Mom t hen says, “Well in that case” – in this situation, then – “I’ll need to have my h air cut, get my makeup done, and buy a new outfit.” “To have your makeup done” means  to have someone do it on you professionally – to have your makeup done in su ch a way that it looks perfect or makes you look perfect. A “new outfit” would be a new set of clothing. Dad is now regretting offering Mom a headshot photograph. He says, “What have I gotten myself into?” meaning “What trouble or diffi culty have I created now for myself by saying that?”

Now, when I was younger we, a couple of times, had a family portrait taken of my family – my brothers and sisters and my parents. No w remember, I come from a very large family. I have ten brothers and sisters,  so there were 13 people in the family portrait. The portrait was taken as part of a little book that was published by the church that I went to as a child. The church  would bring in a professional photographer and families could come and have their  family portrait taken to be used as part of this little book.

Well, the family portrait that I remember was when I was about five or six years old, when we all got up in front of the camera to h ave the photograph taken. The

photographer said, “Oh no, just one family at a tim e,” and my father said, “Well, this is just one family.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places.

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer ju st take the photo?

Dad: We have to pose. The whole point is to look na tural.

Mom: If you wanted a natural family photo, why are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting?

Dad: I want us to stand in front of a nice backgrou nd and pose with nice props. I’m tired of looking at the photos that we take. Th ey’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative cropping.

# Forms of Government

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,114 – Forms of Government.

This is English as a Second Language podcast episod e 1,114. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. If you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this episod e.

This episode is a dialogue between Margaret and Ton y about different forms, or types, of government. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Margaret: Okay, the teacher said that we should set  up an ideal form of government for our imaginary country and then work out detailed plans for governance.

Tony: I think the simplest is a dictatorship. I’ll make all of the decisions.

Margaret: You’re sounding like a fascist. This is s upposed to be a partnership, remember?

Tony: Okay then, let’s make it a monarchy. I can be  king and you can be queen.

Margaret: You’ll probably still make all of the dec isions as king. Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rul e equally.

Tony: That’s fine with me, but you’re the communist , or at least socialist. Don’t you think an oligarchy would be too elitist? I woul d think you would prefer a meritocracy of some sort.

Margaret: This isn’t about my personal politics. It ’s about what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?

Tony: There’s nothing simple about a democracy. How  about no government at all?

Margaret: You mean anarchy?

 Tony: Sure, that would be the simplest.

Margaret: Why do I get the feeling that you’re maki ng suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, rather th an political considerations?

Tony: That’s because you’re very perceptive. I have  a big weekend planned!

[end of dialogue]

Margaret begins our dialogue by saying, “Okay, the teacher said that we should set up an ideal form of government.” “To set up” is  a two-word phrasal verb meaning to establish or start. Margaret and Tony are in a class in which the teacher has instructed the students or told the stu dents to imagine that they are starting a form of government, an “ideal” (ideal) o r perfect form of government. A “form of government” is the way that a country or s ome region within a country organizes itself – how it makes laws and enforces t hem or puts them into effect.

Margaret says that this ideal form of government is  “for our imaginary” – or a made-up – “country.” The teacher also told the stud ents to “work out detailed plans for governance.” “To work out” means to figur e out, to think about, to plan. “Governance” (governance) refers to leadership and control over a group of people. Tony says, “I think the simplest is a dicta torship.” The “simplest” would be the one that is least complicated.

Tony is saying that the simplest form of government  would be a “dictatorship” (dictatorship). A dictatorship is a system of gover nment in which one person is in control and has complete authority over the governm ent. A dictatorship is run by a “dictator,” a person who has absolute and complet e control of the laws and the government in a country. Tony says that he’s going to be the dictator in this imaginary government. He says, “I’ll make all of the decisions.”

Margaret says, “You’re sounding like a fascist.” A “fascist” (fascist) is a person who supports a dictatorship where the nation, and/o r a given race, is considered more important than the individuals. Now, “fascism”  has a particular historical context that we’re not going to talk about here. Pe ople nowadays use this expression not to refer necessarily to, say, the go vernment of Germany or Italy in the 1930s, but rather to someone who is basically a n “authoritarian,” or who believes that the government should be able to do a nything it wants. That’s a more general use of the term in English.

Margaret says, “This is supposed to be a partnershi p, remember?” A “partnership” is when two people work together for some particular purpose. Although nowadays, people talk about “partners” (pa rtners) to refer not just to people with whom they have a partnership, but also for people who they might be in a romantic relationship with. I never quite unde rstood this. I mean, if someone’s your “partner,” either he or she is your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. I mean, really, there aren’t any o ther choices. Are there? But for some reason, nowadays people prefer to say “partner .” I guess they want it to be a mystery, to keep you guessing, perhaps.

Anyway, Tony says, “Okay, let’s make it a monarchy. ” Tony proposes making this imaginary government a “monarchy” (monarchy). A monarchy is a form of government that is led by a monarch – a king or a q ueen. There are various countries throughout the world that still have mona rchies. The government of the United Kingdom – of Great Britain – is a monarchy, officially. The head of the government is the queen of England, Queen Elizabeth  II (at least at the time of this recording).

There are various other monarchies throughout the w orld as well, and many countries that used to have a monarch but no longer  do, such as France. Tony says, “I can be king and you can be queen.” Margare t says, “You’ll probably still make all of the decisions as king.” Margaret doesn’ t really like this idea. She says, “Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rule equally.” An “oligarchy” (oligarchy) is a form of g overnment led by a small group of people who don’t listen to anyone else. They dec ide how the government should be run.

The verb “to rule” (rule) means, in this case, to h ave and use power as a government. It’s often used in connection with a di ctatorship, a monarchy, and other forms of government that are not democratic, although really, it could refer to any kind of government – the functioning of any kind of government. Tony says, “That’s fine with me,” meaning that’s okay wi th me; I agree. “But you’re the communist, or at least socialist.”

Tony refers to Margaret as a “communist” (communist ). A communist is a person who supports a form of government in which everythi ng is owned by the state, basically, and people are paid based on their needs  with the assumption that everyone will contribute as much as he or she can. Of course, communism has different forms, and the real definition is a littl e more complicated than that, but you probably are familiar with communist government s such as the one that used to be in charge of the Soviet Union or the one that  is currently in charge of China.

Tony says that Margaret is a “communist, or at leas t socialist.” A “socialist” (socialist) is a little more difficult to define. A  socialist is a person who believes the government should have a very strong role in ow ning different parts of an economy and that the government should have a very active role in providing for the needs of the people. However, once again, peopl e will differ on the exact definition of what a socialist is.

In some countries, such as the United States, the w ord “socialist,” and certainly the word “communist,” is meant as an insult. It’s n ot something that most politicians would want to say or admit to, although  there is actually a senator from one of our states who is a socialist, but that’s qu ite unusual in terms of American politics.

Tony continues, “Don’t you think an oligarchy would  be too elitist?” “Elitist” (elitist) refers to the idea that one thinks one is better th an everyone else. You think that you are superior, that you and perhaps a small grou p of people know more or are better than the people around you.

Tony says, “I would think you would prefer a merito cracy of some sort.” The word “meritocracy” (meritocracy) refers to a system of g overnment or to a system in general in which people are given power based on th eir qualifications – the most talented, the most able people are given more power . A meritocracy isn’t necessarily a democracy. A meritocracy could be a s ystem of government where someone decides who is the most talented and gives people power based on that decision. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the  people in general decide who is the best to lead the government.

Margaret says, however, “This isn’t about my person al politics.” Your “personal politics” are your own belief systems, your own des ires, your own ways of interacting with other people. She says, “It’s abou t what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?” “Democracy” (democracy) is a system of government in which people vote for the leaders of that government, and in some cases vote directly on laws that will be used by the government. It’s a government by the people.

The United States has a representative form of demo cracy, where we vote on people who then vote on the laws for the country. I t’s not a direct democracy, if you will. We don’t usually vote on laws directly, a lthough there are places, such as here in California, where sometimes we do vote d irectly on a law, on what are called propositions or referendums – but in general , the U.S. has a representative form of democracy.

Tony continues, “There is nothing simple about a de mocracy. How about no government at all?” Margaret says, “You mean anarch y?” “Anarchy” (anarchy) is a situation where there is in fact no government or  no one who is in charge, no one who has authority. It’s generally considered a state of disorder, a situation where there is no government and things often are r ather dangerous. Tony says, “Sure, that would be the simplest.”

Margaret says, “Why do I get the feeling that you’r e making suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, ra ther than political considerations?” Margaret is saying that Tony seems  to be picking the forms of government that are easiest to write about for this  school assignment, not that are best for their imaginary government or imaginar y country.

Tony says, “That’s because you’re very perceptive.”  “To be perceptive” (perceptive) means to be able to understand things that most people aren’t aware of or don’t understand. Tony is telling Marga ret that she’s very perceptive – that the forms of government he is suggesting are  the easiest ones to write about for the school assignment.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Margaret: Okay, the teacher said that we should set  up an ideal form of government for our imaginary country and then work out detailed plans for governance.

Tony: I think the simplest is a dictatorship. I’ll make all of the decisions.

Margaret: You’re sounding like a fascist. This is s upposed to be a partnership, remember?

Tony: Okay then, let’s make it a monarchy. I can be  king and you can be queen.

Margaret: You’ll probably still make all of the dec isions as king. Maybe we should consider an oligarchy. Your family and mine can rul e equally.

Tony: That’s fine with me, but you’re the communist , or at least socialist. Don’t you think an oligarchy would be too elitist? I woul d think you would prefer a meritocracy of some sort.

 Margaret: This isn’t about my personal politics. It ’s about what’s best for our imaginary nation. How about a simple democracy?

Tony: There’s nothing simple about a democracy. How  about no government at all?

Margaret: You mean anarchy?

Tony: Sure, that would be the simplest.

Margaret: Why do I get the feeling that you’re maki ng suggestions based on the amount of work this assignment will take, rather th an political considerations?

Tony: That’s because you’re very perceptive. I have  a big weekend planned!

# Buying Meat from a Butcher

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,115 – Buying Meat from a Butcher.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,115. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com or become a member of ESL Podcast. Why not? If you do, you can download the Learning Guide s for this and all of our recent episodes. You can also take a look at our ES L Podcast Store with additional courses in Daily and Business English.

This episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogue b etween Samantha and a butcher about buying meat. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Butcher: Good morning. What can I get for you?

Samantha: I’d like some lamb chops, pork chops, and  some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.

Butcher: You’ve come to the right butcher shop. Eve rything here is fresh. Everything comes straight from the slaughterhouse.

Samantha: Um, I’m glad to hear that.

Butcher: In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just this morning. You can buy them bone-in, boneless, or whole. They’re a s fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your o wn shotgun.

Samantha: Uh, that’s great. I see that you sell mar inated and stuffed meats, too.

Butcher: Yes, we do. We even make our own sausages.  We use only the freshest ingredients. They’re so fresh I wouldn’t b e surprised if they got up and walked across the floor.

Samantha: Right. I think I’ll just take the chops f or now.

Butcher: Are you sure? I can show you some of the b est prime cuts of beef you’ll ever see. They’re so fresh you could . . .

Samantha: No, no, that’s all for now. I suddenly fe el like a salad for dinner instead.

[end of dialogue] Our dialogue begins with the butcher saying to Sama ntha, “Good morning. What can I get for you?” A “butcher” (butcher) is a pers on whose job it is to cut meat and usually sell the meat to people who want to buy  it. Technically, the butcher is the person who cuts the meat away from the animal o r cuts the meat into smaller pieces. Samantha is talking to a butcher who is ask ing her what she wants, what kind of meat she wants to buy.

Samantha says, “I’d like some lamb chops, pork chop s, and some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.” “Lamb” (lamb) – no tice the “b” is silent when we pronounce the word – is meat that comes from a youn g sheep. A “sheep” is a kind of animal that you also take to hair from in o rder to make clothing. The hair is called “wool” (wool). “Lamb,” then, is meat that  comes from a young sheep.

When we talk about “chops” (chops), we’re referring  to a thick slice of meat, a thick piece of meat that you can cook. Usually, it is made of pork or lamb. We talk about “lamb chops” and “pork chops.” “Pork” is meat  that comes from a pig. Samantha says she wants lamb chops, pork chops, and  some “beef” (beef). “Beef,” you may already know, is meat that comes fr om a cow.

Samantha says she’s not sure which “cuts” she wants  yet. A “cut” (cut) refers here to a section of an animal’s body that we get m eat from. Often we’re talking about specific areas in the animal’s body. An anima l such as a cow has many different sections, and there are four different cu ts of beef that you can get from it. Samantha isn’t sure which cut she wants yet.

The butcher says, “You’ve come to the right butcher  shop.” A “butcher shop” is a store that sells meat and meat products. There aren ’t a lot of butcher shops left in the United States. In most cities, you buy your mea t from a grocery store that sells all kinds of food, but there are still butche r shops. Here in Los Angeles, there’s a butcher shop about two miles from my hous e, but most of the people who buy meat nowadays go to a grocery store, and so  there are butchers who work in grocery stores.

The butcher says, “Everything here is fresh.” To say food is “fresh” means the meat has recently been cut from the animal or that it isn’t old, it isn’t spoiled. The

butcher says, “Everything comes straight from the s laughterhouse.” “To be straight from” means it has come directly from a ce rtain place. It hasn’t been sitting in a warehouse, a storage facility. It has come directly from, in this case, the “slaughterhouse.”

A “slaughterhouse” (slaughterhouse) is a place wher e animals are killed, animals such as pigs and cows and sheep. I grew up in an ag ricultural state in the Midwest, in Minnesota, where there are lots of slau ghterhouses. In fact, there are slaughterhouses, or at least there used to be, not too far from where I lived in St. Paul. The verb “to slaughter” means to kill an anim al, and that’s where you get the word “slaughterhouse.”

Samantha says, “I’m glad to hear that.” She’s glad to hear that the meat is fresh because it comes straight from the slaughterhouse. The butcher continues, “In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just  this morning.” “We got in” means we received. A “shipment” is a large collecti on of something, usually things that are being sold by a store or are being sent to someone who is buying a large number of things.

The butcher is talking about a shipment of “game an d poultry” (poultry). “Game” refers to wild animals or birds that are killed eit her for sport or for food. When I say they’re “wild,” I mean they’re not in a farm – they’re not being raised or brought up to be used as food. They’re animals that  are out in the trees and, well, wherever birds go. “Poultry” refers to a couple of different kinds of animals – “chickens,” “turkeys,” “ducks,” and “geese” are all  what we call “poultry.” They’re birds that are eaten or whose eggs are eaten.

The butcher continues, “You can buy them bone-in, b oneless, or whole.” When you’re buying poultry, sometimes you want the meat to come with the bone still in it – that would be “bone-in.” “Boneless” (boneless)  is when you buy meat, especially poultry meat, without the bone. “Whole” (whole) refers to buying a chicken or a turkey or a duck or a goose without it  being cut up. In other words, you get the whole bird, the whole animal.

Americans love to eat turkey on the celebration in November of our Thanksgiving Day, and most Americans buy a whole turkey and then  cook the whole bird, the whole animal, inside of a large oven. The butcher i s giving Samantha different options for buying the poultry. He continues, “They ’re as fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your o wn shotgun.” A “shotgun” (shotgun) is the kind of gun that you can use to ki ll an animal. You can kill a person with a shotgun as well.

Shotguns are used to shoot things at relatively “cl ose range,” or not too far away from you. There’s another kind of gun called a “rif le” (rifle) that would be used to shoot something that’s far away. I myself am not wh at we would call a “hunter.” I don’t go out and kill animals with guns. I did, how ever, once fire a shotgun that a friend of mine owned. He was a hunter. Where I grew  up in Minnesota, lots of people are into or interested in hunting. I was nev er one of those people.

Samantha says, “Uh, that’s great. I see that you se ll marinated and stuffed meats, too.” “Marinated” (marinated) comes from the  verb “to marinate,” which means to put uncooked meat or vegetables into some kind of liquid in order to give it more flavor, to give it a different taste. “Stuffed” (stuffed) comes from the verb “to stuff,” which means to fill a hole or an o pening in a substance.

Sometimes people “stuff” their turkeys. They put th ings inside of the body of the turkey to cook in addition to cooking the actual tu rkey. That’s very common when people prepare turkeys for Thanksgiving. In fact, w e call the food inside “stuffing” (stuffing). We also use that word “stuffing” for a pillow. The things that you stuff inside of the pillow in order to make it soft is ca lled “stuffing” as well.

The butcher says, “Yes, we do” – yes, we do sell ma rinated and stuffed meats. He continues, “We even make our own sausages.” “Sau sage” (sausage) is meat that has been cut up into very small pieces and usu ally mixed with certain spices and perhaps vegetables and then put inside a skin, what we call a “casing” (casing). Basically it’s a tube-like shape of the m eat that you can cook. The butcher is saying that his butcher shop makes its o wn sausages. “We use only the freshest ingredients.”

An “ingredient” is something you use in preparing f ood. It is a food that is part of a larger dish. The ingredients for an omelet, for e xample, would be an egg, cheese, perhaps some kind of meat. The butcher says , “The sausages are so fresh I wouldn’t be surprised if they got up and wa lked across the floor.” The butcher is saying that the sausages are so fresh it ’s almost as if they were alive, as if they could get up and walk. The idea here is that they were killed or the meat that is used in them comes from animals who we re killed very recently.

Samantha says, “Right. I think I’ll just take the c hops for now.” The butcher says, “Are you sure? I can show you some of the best prim e cuts of beef you’ll ever see.” A “prime (prime) cut” of beef, is a top-quali ty one, a very high-quality cut of beef. Samantha says, “No, that’s all for now. I sud denly feel like a salad for dinner instead.” Apparently Samantha didn’t like the butcher reminding her of where this meat comes from, and she says maybe she’ ll have a salad instead of meat for dinner.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Butcher: Good morning. What can I get for you?

Samantha: I’d like some lamb chops, pork chops, and  some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.

Butcher: You’ve come to the right butcher shop. Eve rything here is fresh. Everything comes straight from the slaughterhouse.

Samantha: Um, I’m glad to hear that.

Butcher: In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just this morning. You can buy them bone-in, boneless, or whole. They’re a s fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your o wn shotgun.

Samantha: Right. I think I’ll just take the chops f or now.

Butcher: Are you sure? I can show you some of the b est prime cuts of beef you’ll ever see. They’re so fresh you could . . .

Samantha: No, no, that’s all for now. I suddenly fe el like a salad for dinner instead.

# Reading and Processing Emails

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,116 – Reading and Processing Emails.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,116. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com, or become a member  of ESL Podcast. If you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this ep isode. What is the Learning Guide? It’s an eight- to ten-page PDF file that you  can download that includes a complete transcript of everything I say, as well as  a glossary with the words and definitions and sample sentences of key vocabulary,  as well as culture notes and a whole lot more. Go to our website for more inform ation.

On this episode, we’re going to talk about reading and processing emails. Let’s get started.  > Every day I feel more and more overwhelmed by email . Once I turn on my computer and look at my inbox, I get sucked into re ading and responding to emails.
> I have a personal email account and an email accoun t for work. With my work email, I try to take an organized approach. I scan each email, looking at the sender and subject line, and delete the ones I don’ t need or want. With the remaining ones, I archive some, file others for fut ure reading, and write replies to the rest. I’ve set up templates for the routine ema ils, but spend a lot of time drafting personalized responses to the rest. That t akes up a large part of my workday.
> When reading my personal email, I take my time. Yes , I get the usual junk that slips through the spam filters and get newsletters I keep meaning to unsubscribe from, but people who have my personal email address  are mainly friends and family.
> When I’m done and I look at the clock, I’m often su rprised at how much time I’ve spent processing email. That’s time I could have be en spending working on my Celine Dion impression.
> I begin my story by saying, “Every day I feel more and more overwhelmed by email.” “To be overwhelmed” (overwhelmed) is to not  be able to deal with something or to make decisions about something beca use the situation is very challenging, very difficult, very demanding. When y ou are “overwhelmed” with something, you have too much of it. You have too mu ch pressure, too much stress, perhaps, because of the situation. If you g et a lot of email, we might say that you are “overwhelmed with email.” The email is  too much for you, too much to handle.

I then say, “Once I turn on my computer and look at  my inbox, I get sucked into reading and responding to emails.” Your “inbox” is the main folder in an email account, the place where all your new emails show u p on your computer or on your mobile device, such as a phone or a tablet. Th at’s your “inbox.”

The word “inbox” (inbox) was originally used – and still is, or could be – to describe a physical box that you have in an office,  say, where people put things for you to look at or do. When you’re done with thi ngs or you want to send them to someone else within an office, you put them in y our “outbox.” Well, we’ve taken those terms from the business world and “impo rted” them, we might say, into our modern vocabulary about technology.

I say that once I “turn on,” or start up, “my compu ter and look at my inbox, I get sucked into reading and responding to emails.” The expression “to get sucked (sucked) into” something means to be forced to do s omething or to be persuaded to do something even though you don’t really want to do it. It might actually be something that you enjoy, but you don’t have time to do.

If you are at work and you like to watch cat videos  on YouTube, you might watch one of them and get sucked into watching 10 of them . It’s almost like you are addicted to that particular activity, so you keep d oing it even though you know you shouldn’t be doing that. You can also get sucke d into a “negative situation,” a situation that you don’t want to be a part of. That ’s really what I mean in saying that “I get sucked into reading and responding to e mails.” “Email,” of course, is short for “electronic mail,” and you probably know what that is if you’re listening to this podcast.

I should explain, in the title of this episode, I s ay “reading and processing emails.” The verb “to process” means here to take care of. F or some reason that’s a word that we use in English when we’re talking about loo king at your email and deciding what you want to do with the emails. You m ight delete it – you might get rid of it – you might answer it, or you might put it aside or do what a lot of people do, simply leave it in your inbox for several days until you finally decide to delete it.

Some people have hundreds of inbox emails that they  say they’re going to get back to but never do. “To process your emails,” the n, means to look at them and to make a decision about what you’re going to do ab out them. I continue, “I have a personal email account and an email account for w ork. With my work email, I try to take an organized approach.” An “approach” i s the way that you do something, how you handle something.

I continue, “I scan each email, looking at the send er and subject lines.” “To scan” (scan) here means to read something very quickly, l ooking for some specific information. It might be a word, it might be a name  – something that you are looking for that will help you, in this case, decid e perhaps what to do with the email. In my case, I scan each email, looking at the “sender” (sender). The sender is the person who, of course, sent me the em ail. The other word we would use, for the person receiving the email, is “ recipient.” If you’re looking at your own inbox, you are the recipient of all of the  emails. So you’re looking at the “senders” – people who sent you emails.

I also look at the “subject line.” The subject line  is what we call that brief description of the topic of the email. Some emails don’t have a subject line. They’re just blank, so you have to open it to see w hat exactly is inside of it. Then I say that I delete the emails I don’t want or need . “To delete” (delete) means to permanently remove, to get rid of something. Usuall y when you delete an email, it goes into your trash. The word “trash” outside of the context of email refers to garbage, junk, things that you don’t want anymore.

In an email program, however, “trash” means the pla ce where your deleted emails go. Sometimes email programs allow you to pu t messages in the trash and then later empty the trash – get rid of all tho se messages permanently. I then say, “With the remaining ones” – that is, with the remaining emails, the ones I didn’t delete – “I archive some, file others for fu ture reading, and write replies to the rest.”

“To archive” (archive) an email means to place it i n a general archive folder. Now, to understand this concept, we really have to define the next term here,

which is “to file” an email. “To file” (file) here means to put a message in a particular folder for some specific purpose. Most e mail programs allow you to create special places where you can store or keep old emails, where you can place them after you take them out of your inbox. You don’t want to delete these emails. You want to keep them for later, but you wa nt to separate them into different groups.

You may have a folder for emails from your family. You may have a folder for emails from your wife. You may have a folder for em ails from your girlfriend, who is not your wife. I’m hoping you don’t have both of  those folders, but you could. That would keep them separate. That’s what we mean by the verb “to file” in the context of an email. It’s to put an email message i n a particular folder.

Most email programs have a, I guess we could call “ general folder,” where you can put stuff even if you’re not putting it in a pa rticular folder, and that would be – I guess we could call it an “archive folder.” So the verb “to archive” means to move your message out of your inbox into this more general folder that is created by the email program itself. So, I can archive emai ls, I can file emails, or I can write “replies” to emails – I can “answer” the emai ls, we would say.

“I’ve set up templates for the routine emails,” I c ontinue, “but spend a lot of time drafting personalized responses for the rest.” “To set up” is a two-word phrasal or verb meaning to establish, to create something. I’v e created or set up “templates” (templates). A “template” is an electronic document  that has writing in it, text in it, that you can use to send to different people.

Usually businesses have templates for when someone writes them an email about a specific question. If a lot of people ask t hat question, the company will just send them the template for that question that has the answer in it. So, you don’t have to write a new email every time. We use templates here at ESL Podcast to respond to some of your messages. “Routi ne (routine) emails” are emails that are common, normal, everyday – emails t hat aren’t unusual or different in any way.

I also say that I “spend a lot of time,” meaning I take a lot of time, “drafting personalized responses.” “To draft” (draft) means t o write something, usually with the idea that you will go back later and edit it an d make it better. “To draft” something means to write something that you’re goin g to work on in the future. You’re going to save it and then work on it later –  make it better and then send it. I say that “drafting personal emails takes up a lar ge part of my workday.” That’s just another way of saying it takes up a lot of tim e during the time that I’m working.

 “When reading my personal email, I take my time.” T he expression “to take your time” means to go slowly, not to rush, not to hurry . “Yes,” I say, “I get the usual junk that slips through the spam filters and get em ails I keep meaning to unsubscribe from.” “Junk (junk) email” is email tha t is sent to you that you don’t want. We sometimes call that type of email “spam” ( spam).

A “spam filter” (filter) is a function in your emai l program or your email service that stops those unwanted emails from getting into your inbox. Usually they go into a special folder called a “spam folder.” Somet imes there are emails that you actually want, that the spam filter puts in the spa m folder. Sometimes you need, therefore, to check your spam folder to make sure it’s not putting things you want into the spam folder instead of your inbox. But usu ally, nowadays, the email programs are pretty good about identifying which em ails are spam and which are ones that you would want.

I also talk about “unsubscribing” to newsletters. “ To unsubscribe” (unsubscribe) is to remove your name and email address from a compan y’s or organization’s email list. The opposite of “unsubscribe” is “subsc ribe,” which is to sign up, or to give your information to an organization or company , allowing that organization or company to send you emails about its activities.  “To unsubscribe” is the opposite. It means to get off of those lists, essen tially.

I finish by saying that “when I’m done” – when I’m finished – “and I look at the clock, I’m often surprised at how much time I’ve sp ent processing email. That’s time I could have been spending working on my Celin e Dion impression.” An “impression” is an imitation – when someone tries t o sound like another person, usually a famous person. I then sing a few lines fr om a famous song by Celine Dion in what is almost certainly the worst impressi on of Ms. Dion in the world.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Every day I feel more and more overwhelmed by email . Once I turn on my computer and look at my inbox, I get sucked into re ading and responding to emails.

I have a personal email account and an email accoun t for work. With my work email, I try to take an organized approach. I scan each email, looking at the sender and subject line, and delete the ones I don’ t need or want. With the remaining ones, I archive some, file others for fut ure reading, and write replies to

 the rest. I’ve set up templates for the routine ema ils, but spend a lot of time drafting personalized responses to the rest. That t akes up a large part of my workday.

When reading my personal email, I take my time. Yes , I get the usual junk that slips through the spam filters and get newsletters I keep meaning to unsubscribe from, but people who have my personal email address  are mainly friends and family.

When I’m done and I look at the clock, I’m often su rprised at how much time I’ve spent processing email. That’s time I could have be en spending working on my Celine Dion impression.

 “Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on. . . .”

On this episode, we listen to a dialogue between Ar mand and Suzanne about assembling, or putting together, furniture. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Armand: Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?

Suzanne: The box said that it required simple assem bly. I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.

Armand: You can say that again. These instructions aren’t in English, there are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and  we seem to be missing parts. I also question the quality. It’s mainly mad e of particleboard and plywood. Do you think we should return it?

Suzanne: No, let’s just keep it and do the best we can.

Armand: That’s hard to do when there seems to be a design flaw with the drawers. The pieces don’t fit together as they shou ld. These nails are also bent and these screws look defective.

Suzanne: It’s not looking good, is it? I also bough t this because I thought everything could be assembled using Allen wrenches,  but it looks like we’ll actually need a hammer, screwdriver, and maybe a dr ill.

Armand: Well, let’s see what we can do. If we don’t  have the right tools or parts, I have a solution.

Suzanne: What?

Armand: Duct tape.

[end of dialogue]

Armand begins our dialogue by asking Suzanne, “Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?” A  “nightstand” (nightstand) – one word – is a small table that you put next to your bed, usually to put a lamp, a clock, and perhaps a glass of water on. A nightstan d usually also has what we call “drawers” – little boxes that pull out from the table that you can put things in and then slide back into the table.

Armand is asking Suzanne if she knew before she bou ght it “that this nightstand required assembly.” “Assembly” (assembly) is the no un form of the verb “to assemble” (assemble). “To assemble” means to put so mething together – to take individual pieces and to put them together to make something else. Nowadays it’s popular for some stores to sell furniture (thi ngs you put in your house such as tables, chairs, and perhaps nightstands) “unassembl ed” – that is, they’re not put together. You have to basically build or put the pi ece of furniture together yourself.

One popular store here in the U.S. and in many othe r countries is IKEA, a Swedish company. You can buy furniture, but usually  you have to assemble it yourself. And boy, if you’ve ever assembled somethi ng from IKEA, you know it’s not as easy as it looks. It’s not as easy as it app ears. Anyway, Armand is not very happy, I think, with Suzanne, because he has t o assemble this nightstand.

Suzanne says, “The box said” (the cardboard contain er that it came in is called a box) “that it required simple assembly.” “Simple as sembly” would be not very complicated – maybe three or four pieces, say. She continues, “I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.” The company thi nks it’s simple, but you don’t think it’s simple. Armand says, “You can say that a gain.” That expression “You can say that again” is when someone says something that you agree with and you want to emphasize that you really agree with th at person.

Armand says, “These instructions aren’t in English.  There are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and we seem to be missing parts.” So, the instructions – the information that tells you how t o assemble the furniture – aren’t in English for this particular nightstand, accordin g to Armand. He also says there are “no diagrams showing how the parts fit together .” A “diagram” (diagram) is a

drawing that shows you how something works or how s omething should be put together.

“To fit together” means to be placed next to each o ther and joined so that they are connected. If you are assembling a table, the l egs would fit together with the table top. They would be connected to each other. H owever, Armand says that they “seem to be missing parts.” A “part” (part) he re is a piece – in this case, a piece of the nightstand. “I also question the quali ty,” Armand says. “To question” here means to doubt, or to have doubts about someth ing.

Armand says, “It’s mainly made of particleboard and  plywood.” “Particleboard” is a cheap, inexpensive material made by compressing, or putting together, many smaller pieces of wood. Sometimes companies sell fu rniture made of particleboard because it’s cheaper. Another cheap f orm of wood is called “plywood” (plywood). Plywood is a wooden board made  from layers of wood that are glued together – they’re stuck together. Plywoo d is usually very thin.

Some people use plywood on the walls. They put the plywood up, up on the walls. This was very popular in the 1960s, in the 1 970s. Instead of painting your wall or putting wallpaper on it, you could put piec es of wood on it called plywood. My house where I grew up had plywood in several of the rooms because my father didn’t want to paint the rooms every couple of years. So, we had this brown plywood on the walls. It was quite normal dur ing the 1970s, or at least it was in the neighborhood where I grew up.

Armand asks Suzanne if perhaps they should “return”  this nightstand, meaning bring it back to the store and get their money back . Suzanne says, “No, let’s just keep it and do the best we can.” Armand says, “That ’s hard to do when there seems to be a design flaw with the drawers.” A “des ign (design) flaw (flaw)” is a mistake in the way that something was conceived or created. It’s a mistake in the basic idea behind, in this case, the nightstand. Ar mand says there’s a design flaw with the drawers of the nightstand. “The pieces don ’t fit together as they should,” he says.

“These nails are also bent and these screws look de fective,” says Armand. “Nails” (nails) are straight long pieces of metal w ith pointed ends that you use to put two things together. I say they’re long, but I mean really they’re perhaps between a quarter of an inch and an inch or two inc hes. “Nails” are used usually to put together pieces of wood, although you can us e a nail to connect or to join two other kinds of material as well. Armand says th at the nails that came with this nightstand are “bent” (bent). “Bent” here means not  straight. Another word we would use is “crooked” (crooked).

 Armand also says, “These screws look defective.” A “screw” (screw) here means a long piece of metal, about the size of a nail, th at has a spiral pattern around it. A screw is not pounded in with a hammer as you woul d a nail. A screw is put into a piece of wood or a piece of metal using something  called a “screwdriver.” It turns in order to go into the material. You don’t h it it. You turn it with a screwdriver. “Defective” (defective) means it doesn ’t work properly. It has a problem.

Suzanne says, “It’s not looking good, is it?” meani ng it doesn’t look like this nightstand is going to be one that they want to kee p. She says, “I also bought this because I thought everything could be assembled usi ng Allen wrenches.” An “Allen wrench” (wrench) is a small tool that is in the shape of the letter L. It’s a metal tool that has a six-sided shape at the end of  it, what we call a “hexagon,” and it’s used to turn special kinds of screws that require this special kind of wrench. The screws themselves have a hole that is s ix-sided.

Suzanne says, “It looks like we actually need a ham mer, screwdriver, and maybe a drill. A “hammer” (hammer) is a heavy tool that y ou use to pound nails into a piece of wood or other material. A “screwdriver” is  a long piece of metal that is used to twist or turn screws so that the screw goes  into the material. A “drill” (drill) is an electric tool that is often used inst ead of a screwdriver to put material into a piece of wood or metal.

Armand says, “Well, let’s see what we can do. If we  don’t have the right tools or parts, I have a solution.” Suzanne says, “What?” Ar mand says, “Duct tape.” “Duct tape” (duct tape) is a very strong, thick tap e that is usually grey in color and nowadays is used to connect two different things to gether that perhaps are broken or that you don’t have another way of connec ting or keeping together.

People use duct tape nowadays all the time to cover  a hole in something or to fix something that has broken. It’s a very strong tape that can be quite useful when something breaks or when you don’t have a way of bi nding two things together with normal tape.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Armand: Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?

Suzanne: The box said that it required simple assem bly. I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.

Armand: You can say that again. These instructions aren’t in English, there are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and  we seem to be missing parts. I also question the quality. It’s mainly mad e of particleboard and plywood. Do you think we should return it?

# Bidding on Online Auctions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,118 – Bidding on Online Auctions.

This episode is a dialogue between Jermaine and Bet hany about buying things online. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine: Wait! You shouldn’t bid on that auction r ight now. Wait until the last minute.

Bethany: This auction has a buy-it-now price of $25  and free shipping.

Jermaine: Don’t pay the buy-it-now price. The minim um bid on this item is $10 and the current bid is only $12.50. There’s no rese rve, so if you wait to bid, you may snag it for a much lower price than $25.

Bethany: Okay, I guess I can wait, but why can’t I place a bid of $15 right now?

Jermaine: First of all, the bidding on this auction  goes up by increments of 50 cents, so the next bid would be $13. You could plac e a maximum bid of $15, but someone might outbid you at any time.

Bethany: But couldn’t that happen anyway? Even if I  wait until the last minute someone could sneak in and bid a higher price.

Jermaine: You mean they could snipe you? They could , but not if you snipe them back. It’s all in the timing.

Bethany: You seem to know a lot about online auctio ns.

Jermaine: That item you’re bidding on, guess who li sted it?

 [end of dialogue]

Jermaine says to Bethany, “Wait!” meaning “Stop – d on’t do what you are about to do.” He says, “You shouldn’t” – you should not –  “bid on that auction right now. Wait until the last minute.” “To bid” (bid) is to s ay how much you are willing to pay for something, usually in a situation where there i s more than one person interested in buying whatever it is you’re interest ed in buying. Normally we bid at an event called an “auction” (auction).

An “auction” is where either someone in person (sta nding in front of you) or online is selling something, and a number of differ ent people are interested in buying it. Each person says how much he or she is w illing to pay for it. When you say how much you want to pay for something – when y ou are, in effect, offering to buy something – that’s called a “bid.”

So you’re not just saying, “Oh, I would pay $50.” You are saying, “I will pay,” because if your bid is accepted – if you, what we w ould call, “win the auction” – then you have to pay $50 to buy whatever it is you bid on. “To bid on” means to give a price that you are willing to pay for a cert ain object, to make an offer on a item. We use the preposition “on” after the verb “t o bid” to describe the item that you want. “I bid on a car.” “I bid on a house.” “I bid $30.” If you’re just giving the actual price that you are offering or willing to pa y, then there is no preposition “on” after the verb.

Anyway, back to the story. Jermaine says to Bethany , “You shouldn’t bid on that auction right now. Wait until the last minute.” Now , Bethany is bidding on an online auction. “Online” means, of course, on the I nternet. One online auction website is “eBay” (eBay). Jermaine says that Bethan y should “wait until the last minute,” meaning wait until the auction is just abo ut to end.

Bethany says, “This auction has a buy-it-now price of $25 and free shipping.” On some websites, such as eBay, you don’t have to bid against other people for certain items. Some sellers, people who are selling  things, will say, “Well, here’s a price that I will take and give it to you right n ow. I won’t worry about taking any bids.” That’s called the “buy-it-now” price. Pretty  logical, right? “Free shipping” means that the seller won’t add an additional cost on to the price of the item to pay for the shipping – the process of mailing somet hing to you.

Now, not everything that you buy is shipped; someti mes you buy things that are “virtual” (virtual). Virtual items are things that you download or you access on your computer. So this item, this auction, has a “b uy-it-now price of $25.” (I say

“this auction” – I mean this auction for an item of  $25.) Jermaine, however, says, “Don’t pay the buy-it-now price. The minimum bid on  this item is $10 and the current bid is only $12.50.”

What happens when you put an item into an online au ction site such as eBay (and I’m using eBay because I’m familiar with it, a nd it’s popular here in the U.S.), you are given the option of putting a minimu m bid. That means you say, “This is the least amount of money I will accept.” You’re hoping for more, but you won’t take any less than this amount. That is your “minimum (minimum) bid.” “Minimum” means the least. The opposite would be “m aximum” (maximum), but nobody has a maximum bid. Sellers will take however  much money you want to give them.

Jermaine says that the minimum bid on this item is $10. What he’s saying is that the buy-it-now price is $25, and so far the highest  bid is only $12.50. So maybe you can get it cheaper, Jermaine is saying, if you bid on it rather than paying the buy-it-now price. Why would you buy it now rather t han bid on it? Well it may be because you want the item right away. You don’t wan t to wait, and some of these auctions last three or even six or seven days. I’m not sure exactly how many days the typical eBay auction lasts, but usually it ’s more than a couple of days.

Jermaine continues, “There’s no reserve, so if you wait to bid, you may snag it for a much lower price.” The minimum bid, I mentioned e arlier, is the least amount of money that you will accept for an item. However, yo u actually can put into the auction system what’s called a “reserve” (reserve).  The “reserve” is your secret, if you will, minimum bid. So if you say to someone, “T he minimum bid is $10,” that doesn’t mean that if they bid $10 you will say yes.  You could also put a “reserve.”

Now, you don’t tell people what the reserve is, but  the reserve is the minimum price you will actually accept. It’s a little confu sing. The “minimum bid” is what you tell people on the website is the least amount of money that you can bid. That doesn’t mean if you bid the minimum bid you wi ll get the item, because you could also have a “reserve,” which is a higher pric e that you will have to get in order to agree to sell the item.

You can tell on these websites often whether someon e has a reserve or not. If the person has no reserve, then the minimum bid is,  in effect, the reserve. It’s the minimum price the seller will accept. Jermaine says  that Bethany could “snag” (snag) the item for a lower price. “To snag” someth ing is to buy it at a very low price – to get something cheap, usually due to some  sort of luck. Bethany says, “Okay, I guess I can wait, but why can’t I place a bid of $15 right now?” “To place a bid” means the same as “to bid.”

 Jermaine says, “First of all, the bidding on this a uction goes up by increments of 50 cents.” “Increments” (increments) are intervals,  small increases in the value of something. You can’t, for example, bid on some item s $10.05. You in many cases have to bid only in 50-cent or one-dollar inc rements, meaning the next highest bid has to be 50 cents above the previous b id. So the next bid after $12.50 (if you’re still awake out there) is $13. “You could place a maximum bid,” Jermaine continues, “of $15, but someone might outb id you at any time.”

The maximum bid is your secret price, the amount th at you will pay – the most that you will pay, I should say – for an item. So, I put into the website the maximum amount I will pay. Now, why would I do this ? Well, because people may come on later when I’m sleeping and bid more th an what my bid was. The auction site will automatically add a bid for me up  to my maximum bid. The verb we use when someone bids more than you and ultimate ly gets the item is “outbid” (outbid). “I was outbid by this person,” o r “This person outbid me.”

Bethany says, “But couldn’t that happen anyway? Eve n if I wait until the last minute” – meaning right before the auction ends – “ someone could sneak in and bid a higher price.” “To sneak (sneak) in” means to  do something secretly in a hidden and unnoticed way – when you don’t want to b e seen. Bethany is complaining that someone could bid higher than her right at the very last minute, right when the auction is about to end.

Jeremy says, “You mean they could snipe you?” To sn eak in at the last minute in an auction has a special verb, and that verb is “to  snipe” (snipe). I’m not sure if this is a verb that was invented for the Internet a ge, but it is the verb that is used by people on online auction sites. “To snipe” means  to get the highest bid immediately before the auction ends – sometimes jus t seconds before the auction ends.

Jeremy says “They could,” meaning someone could sni pe you, “but not if you snipe them back,” meaning not if you get in before them with a higher bid. “It’s all in the timing,” Jermaine says. “Timing” (timing) is  when you should do certain things, especially as part of a plan. We often talk  about comedians having good timing or bad timing. It has to do with how long th ey wait before they tell the next part of the joke.

Bethany says to Jermaine, “You seem to know a lot a bout online auctions.” Jermaine says, “That item your bidding on, guess wh o listed it?” “To list” (list) something on an auction site is to put it on the we bsite to sell – to upload information or put information into the website so that people can then later bid

on your item. Jermaine is saying that the item that  Bethany is bidding on is one that he himself listed. That’s why he says, “Guess who listed it?” The implication here is that Jermaine listed the item.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine: Wait! You shouldn’t bid on that auction r ight now. Wait until the last minute.

Bethany: This auction has a buy-it-now price of $25  and free shipping.

Jermaine: Don’t pay the buy-it-now price. The minim um bid on this item is $10 and the current bid is only $12.50. There’s no rese rve, so if you wait to bid, you may snag it for a much lower price than $25.

Bethany: Okay, I guess I can wait, but why can’t I place a bid of $15 right now?

Jermaine: First of all, the bidding on this auction  goes up by increments of 50 cents, so the next bid would be $13. You could plac e a maximum bid of $15, but someone might outbid you at any time.

Bethany: But couldn’t that happen anyway? Even if I  wait until the last minute someone could sneak in and bid a higher price.

Jermaine: You mean they could snipe you? They could , but not if you snipe them back. It’s all in the timing.

# Methods for Quitting Smoking

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,119 – Methods for Quitting Smoking.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,119. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Special Courses in Business and Daily English. On this epis ode of ESL Podcast, we’re going to talk about someone who is trying to quit s moking – to stop smoking cigarettes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lisa: This is it. I’m quitting smoking for good.

Michael: Good for you. Are you going cold turkey?

Lisa: No, I tried that, but it didn’t work. I crave d cigarettes too much.

Michael: How about nicotine gum? Have you tried tha t?

Lisa: Yes, but I didn’t like the side effects. It i rritated my throat.

Michael: That’s too bad. I suppose you’ve tried nic otine patches, too?

Lisa: Yes, I have. I became addicted to the patches  and couldn’t wean myself off of them. I just traded one addiction for another.

Michael: And electronic cigarettes?

Lisa: They only made me want to smoke a real cigare tte. They were no help at all.

Michael: So, what now?

Lisa: I’m going to try hypnosis. I hear that it wor ks for some people.

Michael: And if that doesn’t work?

Lisa: The last resort is acupuncture. Some people s ay that’s effective for quitting smoking.

Michael: If you say so. Sometimes the cure is truly  worse than the disease!

[end of dialogue]

Lisa begins our dialogue by saying, “This is it. I’ m quitting smoking for good.” “To quit smoking” means to stop smoking cigarettes and never smoke them again. “For good” is an expression we use to mean forever,  permanently, from now on. “My girlfriend and I have broken up for good.” We’r e not ever going to get back together. Michael says to Lisa, “Good for you” afte r she tells him she is going to quit smoking, or stop smoking. “Good for you,” whic h is another way of congratulating someone, saying that they have done something good.

He says, “Are you going cold turkey?” The phrase “t o go cold turkey” (turkey) means to quit something immediately – not to use a little less today and perhaps a little less the day after that until you finally stop, but rather to stop immediately without trying to reduce your use before you stop u sing it. Lisa says, “No, I tried that but it didn’t work.” She tried going cold turk ey but it didn’t work.

You may be wondering why it’s called “cold turkey.”  No one knows exactly for sure. The original meaning of the expression was to  speak plainly – to not try to use big words or complicated sentences, but to spea k the truth in a simple way. So perhaps the idea of quitting something immediate ly, without any other sorts of devices or approaches. But in any case, nowadays “t o go cold turkey” means to stop doing some sort of bad habit, like smoking, im mediately.

Lisa says she is not going to go cold turkey. She s ays, “I craved cigarettes too much,” referring to the last time she tried to stop  smoking that way. “To crave” (crave) something is to have a very strong desire t o eat it or drink it or have it. Usually we crave things that are physical pleasures  – like for example, the pleasure of eating or drinking certain kinds of dri nk.

Michael says, “How about nicotine gum?” Michael is giving Lisa a suggestion – perhaps she should try “nicotine (nicotine) gum (gu m).” “Gum” is a substance you put in your mouth to chew. Nicotine gum is a specia l kind of gum that has certain chemicals – nicotine – that are found in cigarettes , and it allows you to get a little bit of nicotine without actually having to smoke.

Michael asks if Lisa has tried nicotine gum. She sa ys, “Yes, but I don’t like the side effects.” A “side effect” is some unwanted con sequence of using a particular

medicine or drug. Sometimes when you take a drug to  help your body heal or feel better, it can cause other problems in your bo dy. It might cause you a headache or to have an upset stomach. These are sid e effects of some drugs. It may make you sleepy.

Lisa says the side effect of nicotine gum for her w as that it “irritated” her throat. “To irritate” (irritate) here means to cause a part  of your body to become scratchy or red or uncomfortable. If something irritates you r throat, it causes a strange, somewhat painful feeling in your throat. The verb “ to irritate” can also mean to make someone else mad. So I guess you could think of it as, in this sense, the nicotine gun making her throat mad, maybe. Your “th roat” (throat) is the part of the body inside of your neck. We breathe and eat an d drink using our throat, normally.

Michael says, “That’s too bad.” He’s saying it’s un fortunate that the nicotine gum irritates Lisa’s throat. He says, “I suppose you’ve  tried nicotine patches, too?” A “nicotine patch” (patch) is like a sticker that you  put on your body that delivers medicine into your body. A “nicotine patch” would d eliver nicotine chemicals into your body, similar to a nicotine gum. Once again, t he purpose is to get the nicotine into your body to satisfy its cravings wit hout actually smoking the cigarette.

Lisa says, “Yes, I have.” She has tried the nicotin e patches. She says, however, “I became addicted to the patches and couldn’t wean  myself off of them.” “To become addicted” (addicted) to something is to have  a strong desire or need for a particular substance, or even experience. It’s su ch a strong desire that it has other negative effects on your life. Lisa says she became addicted to the nicotine patch, which of course was supposed to help her sto p smoking, help her stop being addicted to cigarettes.

However, Lisa says she couldn’t wean herself off of  them. “To wean (wean) yourself off of” something is to gradually use some  substance less and less until finally you don’t use it at all. It’s to reduce the  amount that you have or that you do slowly, in order to eventually stop doing it or having it altogether. Lisa says, “I just traded one addiction for another.” “To trade” means to give one thing and to get another thing back. In this case, she stopped s moking, but then she became addicted to the nicotine patch.

Michael gives another suggestion to Lisa, “And elec tronic cigarettes?” “Electronic cigarettes,” sometimes called e-cigarettes, are bas ically pen-shaped devices. They look sort of like a cigarette. The devices, the electronic cigarettes, turn

nicotine into a gas that you then put into your bod y, but it doesn’t have the same harmful effects of smoking – at least, that’s the t heory.

Lisa says, “They only made me want to smoke a real cigarette.” She said that smoking an electronic cigarette made her want to sm oke a real cigarette. I’m not sure if that’s always true. Some people say it’s the opposite. But in any case, that is what happened to Lisa. She says, “They were no h elp at all.” Michael then asks, “So, what now?” meaning “What are you going to do now?”

Lisa says, “I’m going to try hypnosis.” “Hypnosis” (hypnosis) is a technique in which a person appears to be asleep, but can still hear and answer questions. Some people use hypnosis to help change their behav ior, to stop doing something that they want to stop doing, like in thi s case, smoking cigarettes. I’ve never actually been “hypnotized.” That’s the verb w e would use. I have never been under hypnosis. I’m not sure if it would work with me, but some people say it works.

Lisa says, “I hear that it,” meaning hypnosis, “wor ks for some people.” Michael says, “And if that doesn’t work?” He’s asking what Lisa’s going to do if hypnosis does not help her quit smoking. Lisa responds, “The  last resort is acupuncture.” A “last (last) resort (resort)” is the last option that you have when everything else has failed. Usually it’s something that you don’t r eally want to do.

If you’re having an argument with your girlfriend, you might try to talk to her. You might try to give her a gift. You might try being n ice to her. But as a last resort, you can always break up with her. You can always en d your relationship. That’s not something you want to do, but if you have to, y ou could. It’s the last option for action. For Lisa, the last resort is “acupuncture” (acupuncture). “Acupuncture” is a treatment involving putting small sharp pieces of  metal called “needles” in your skin.

Some people say that you can use acupuncture to red uce pain, or to in this case help you quit smoking. I actually had a good friend  that I used to teach with, a German teacher, who quit smoking, I suppose, 10 yea rs or so before I had met her. She says that she used acupuncture. She went t o an acupuncturist and the person put some sort of needle into her ear, and sh e said from that day on, she didn’t want to smoke another cigarette. Well, maybe  it was for some other reason, I don’t know, but that’s what she told me.

Michael seems a little skeptical about acupuncture.  He doesn’t seem to think it is going to work. That’s why he says, “If you say so.”  That expression “if you say so” is used when you don’t really believe what the other person is saying, but you

don’t want to argue about it either. Michael says, “Sometimes the cure is truly worse than the disease.” A “cure” (cure) is somethi ng that helps you get better, to get better physically, to get healthier. A “disease ” (disease) is something that hurts your body.

The expression “The cure is worse than the disease”  means that the solution that you have to get better is going to actually be wors e for you than the thing that you started with. So, if your friend hurts her hand  and you say to her, “Oh, well, I can just cut your hand off,” your friend might say,  “Well, the cure is worse than the disease.” Yes, my hand will stop hurting, but t hen I won’t have a hand.

So you don’t want the thing that you are doing to f ix a problem to make it worse, or to make the situation worse. Michael thinks that  putting needles into your body is worse than the actual disease. In this case, he’ s referring to Lisa’s habit of smoking, even though that isn’t technically a disea se.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lisa: This is it. I’m quitting smoking for good.

Michael: Good for you. Are you going cold turkey?

Lisa: No, I tried that, but it didn’t work. I crave d cigarettes too much.

Michael: How about nicotine gum? Have you tried tha t?

Lisa: Yes, but I didn’t like the side effects. It i rritated my throat.

Michael: That’s too bad. I suppose you’ve tried nic otine patches, too?

Lisa: Yes, I have. I became addicted to the patches  and couldn’t wean myself off of them. I just traded one addiction for another.

Michael: And electronic cigarettes?

Lisa: They only made me want to smoke a real cigare tte. They were no help at all.

Michael: So, what now?

 Lisa: I’m going to try hypnosis. I hear that it wor ks for some people.

Michael: And if that doesn’t work?

Lisa: The last resort is acupuncture. Some people s ay that’s effective for quitting smoking.

Michael: If you say so. Sometimes the cure is truly  worse than the disease!

# Breaching a Contract

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,120 – Breaching a Contract.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,120. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com, or download a Learning Guide for this episode. While you’re there, you can take a look at  our ESL Podcast Special Courses in Business and Daily English. And we have an ESL Podcast Blog you can check out as well.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Sandra and Antonin about breaching or breaking a contract, an official  agreement between two people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: I don’t know what to do. Our contractor ins talled the wrong equipment and now we’re having major problems. I’ve tried con tacting her, but she’s dodging my calls. The trouble is I’ve already paid her in full.

Antonin: Well, that’s a breach of contract. Your on ly recourse might be to take her to court.

Sandra: I’d hate to do that. I’d rather settle this  out of court.

Antonin: I don’t blame you, but if she’s hiding out  or has washed her hands of this whole situation, suing her might be the only way to  compel her to fix the problem.

Sandra: We’ve already suffered major damage as a re sult of her mistakes.

Antonin: Then that’s all the more reason to see you r attorney. You’ll need to go to court to collect damages.

Sandra: Aren’t you an attorney? Couldn’t you help u s?

Antonin: I’m a divorce attorney. I can only help yo u if you’re married to your contractor.

[end of dialogue]

I want to start this episode by apologizing a littl e bit for my voice today. It seems to be a little “hoarse” (hoarse). When your voice i s “hoarse,” you sound like this. You sound as though perhaps you’ve been using your voice too much. Maybe screaming at the television, as I was doing last ni ght when the Dodgers were playing – my favorite baseball team, of course.

Anyway, this episode is not about voices or basebal l. It’s about breaching a contract. A “contract” (contract) is a legal agreem ent between two people or two organizations – we usually use the term “parties” ( parties). This isn’t the kind of party where you go drinking and dancing. The term “ party” in legal English, if you will, refers to two people or groups that are part of some sort of official contract or agreement.

Sandra begins by saying, “I don’t know what to do. Our contractor installed the wrong equipment and now we’re having major problems .” Your “contractor” (contractor) is a person who you have a contract wi th, but who specifically works on construction projects. Building a house, or perh aps putting in a new bathroom, putting on a new roof – these would all be projects  that a contractor would work on.

The contractor “installed the wrong equipment,” acc ording to Sandra. “To install” (install) means to take a piece of equipment, in th is case, and make sure that it is working properly, connecting it to the other parts of whatever it is it is being connected to. So, for example, if you buy a new sto ve for cooking, the contractor would install your stove, would put it in the right  place, connect the gas to it or the electricity that it needed, and so forth.

We use this verb “to install” also when we’re talki ng about software – computer programs that you put on your computer or your iPho ne, Android phone, tablet, whatever it is you have. Sandra says, “I’ve tried c ontacting her” – “her” being the contractor – “but she’s dodging my calls.” There ar en’t a lot of female contractors even today, but Sandra apparently found one. She tr ied contacting her, but the contractor is “dodging my calls.” “To dodge” (dodge ) means to avoid someone or something, to find a way not to deal with someone.

The contractor is dodging her calls. She’s not answ ering her phone or returning her calls. Sandra says, “The trouble is I’ve alread y paid her in full.” “To pay someone in full” (full) means to give them 100 perc ent of the money you owe them. Sometimes, with contractors who work at your house, you give them, say,

 percent before they start working and then the r est of it when they finish the job. Well, Sandra has already paid this contractor “in full” – 100 percent.

Antonin says, “Well, that’s a breach of contract.” A “breach” (breach) here means a breaking of – when someone doesn’t follow the con tract. The legal expression would be a “breach of contract.” He says, “Your onl y recourse might be to take her to court.” A “recourse” (recourse) is something  you do in a difficult or challenging situation, but it isn’t really somethin g you want to do. It isn’t your first choice.

“Recourse” is another word you will mostly hear in some sort of legal discussion or read about in something that is talking about le gal issues. A “recourse” is something that you can do in order to try to get ou t of a situation. “To take someone to court” (court) means to go to the govern ment and complain in the hopes of getting your money back. To take someone t o court is “to sue” (sue) them – to go to a judge and say, “This person broke  the contract” – breached the contract – “and I want my money back.”

Sandra says, “I’d hate to do that.” She doesn’t wan t to do that. “I’d rather settle this out of court.” “To settle” (settle) something means to solve some problem, to take care of some difficult situation. “Out of cour t” means without going to the government, without going to the judge and asking h im to take care of the situation. “To settle something out of court” means  to take care of it on your own, without involving the government at all.

Antonin says, “I don’t blame you.” “To blame” (blam e) someone is to say that they did something wrong, to say that they are resp onsible for some problem. However, when someone says, “I don’t blame you,” he ’s saying I understand why you’re doing what you’re doing, even though I don’t  completely agree with it. Antonin says, “I don’t blame you, but if she’s hidi ng out or has washed her hands of this whole situation, suing her might be the onl y way to compel her to fix the problem.”

Lots of expressions in that sentence – let’s start with “she’s hiding out.” “To hide (hide) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that really means the same as “to hide.” It means to stay away from other people and not allow yourself to be found. Usually we use this phrasal verb when we’re talking  about someone who has done something wrong and doesn’t want the police or  anyone else finding him.

“To wash your hands of something” means to say that  you are not going to get involved or you are not accepting responsibility for a situation. Those of you familiar with the Christian Bible will remember the  famous scene of Pontius Pilate

washing his hands of the situation involving Jesus.  Well, that’s probably one of the origins – if not the origin – of this expressio n “to wash your hands of” something. It means to indicate that you’re not going to have anything to do with it. You’re not going to get involved in this situat ion.

Antonin says that suing the contractor “might be the only way to compel her to fix the problem.” We already mentioned the verb “to sue ,” which is to take someone to court. “To compel” (compel) someone means to mak e someone do something. To say here, “You have to do it now.” Sandra says, “We’ve already suffered major damage as a result of her mistakes.” She’s sa ying that they’ve already had a lot of problems, that they have actually had dama ge done to their house.

Antonin says, “Then that’s all the more reason to s ee your attorney.” The expression “all the more reason” is a little unusua l, but you will hear that in English or read it. It means an even better reason or motivation for doing something – when you give someone a reason to do so mething and then you want to give them an additional reason. Usually it’ s something the other person has said that you agree would be another good reaso n for doing something. You would say, “All the more reason to do it.”

For example, if your friend wants to ask a girl out  on a date, – ask her to go to dinner with him – you might say to him, “Well, she’ s very beautiful. You should ask her out.” And your friend says to you, “And I h eard she just broke up with her boyfriend.” You might say, “Well, all the more reas on to ask her out, now that she doesn’t have a boyfriend anymore.”

It’s a little dangerous asking them out if they hav e boyfriends. Be careful about that, guys. I know.

Anyway, Antonin says, “all the more reason to see y our attorney” (attorney). Your “attorney” is your lawyer, the person who has studi ed law and represents people and then takes all of your money. Antonin says, “Yo u’ll need to go to court to collect damages.” “To collect damages” means to get  money back from someone who has hurt you, or has done something wrong, or i n this case has “breached a contract.”

Sandra says, “Aren’t you an attorney. Couldn’t you help us?” Antonin says, “I’m a divorce attorney.” Attorneys often specialize in on e kind of law. Antonin says he doesn’t do this kind of law – the kind that Sandra would need. Instead, he’s a “divorce (divorce) attorney.” A “divorce” is a lega l end to your marriage. He helps people get divorced, we would say. So he’s not goin g to be a lot of help in this situation.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: I don’t know what to do. Our contractor ins talled the wrong equipment and now we’re having major problems. I’ve tried con tacting her, but she’s dodging my calls. The trouble is I’ve already paid her in full.

Antonin: Well, that’s a breach of contract. Your on ly recourse might be to take her to court.

Sandra: I’d hate to do that. I’d rather settle this  out of court.

Antonin: I don’t blame you, but if she’s hiding out  or has washed her hands of this whole situation, suing her might be the only way to  compel her to fix the problem.

Sandra: We’ve already suffered major damage as a re sult of her mistakes.

Antonin: Then that’s all the more reason to see you r attorney. You’ll need to go to court to collect damages.

Sandra: Aren’t you an attorney? Couldn’t you help u s?

Antonin: I’m a divorce attorney. I can only help yo u if you’re married to your contractor.

# Outdoor Sun Protection

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,121 – Outdoor Sun Protection.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,121. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Are you on Facebook? Hey, so am I. Go to facebook.c om/eslpod and like our page. You can also, of course, go to our website at  ESLPod.com and download other excellent courses in English that we offer.

This episode is a dialogue between June and Wally a bout making sure you protect your skin when you are outside and the sun is shining. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

June: Wait! You forgot your sun hat.

Wally: I’m not wearing that hat. It looks ridiculou s on me.

June: It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays. You’re  too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t want to get another s unburn.

Wally: I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine.

June: This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need  that, too.

Wally: All right. Anything else?

June: Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.

Wally: Okay, I’m leaving now. I’m surprised you did n’t get me some protective clothing. My arms and legs are exposed.

June: I’m glad you reminded me. Here’s a sun cape. It’s made of a breathable fabric. Make sure you wear it every minute you’re o utside. Promise?

Wally: [sigh]

[end of dialogue]

Here comes the sun Here comes the sun, and I said It’s alright . . .

Oh, sorry. On this episode, we listen to June and W ally talking about the fascinating subject of sun protection. Well, it’s n ot fascinating. It’s not really that interesting, but it is important and so we’re going  to talk about it. June says to Wally, “Wait, you forgot your sun hat.” A “sun hat”  is a large hat that sits on your head – where all hats go - but has what we call a l arge “brim” (brim). That’s the part of the hat that sticks straight out, and in th is case would help protect your face from the sun so that you don’t get the sun com ing down directly on your face, if you will.

Wally says, “I’m not wearing that hat. It looks rid iculous on me.” Wally means it looks funny. It looks stupid. It looks weird. June,  however, says, “It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays.” The “rays” (rays) of the sun are the lines of light, I guess we could call them, that come from the sun. June says,  “You’re too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t wan t to get another sunburn.” We talk about people’s skin being “fair” when it is, l ike my skin, very white and gets sunburned very easily.

“Sunburn” (sunburn) is when you are out in the sun too much and your skin turns red, and it can be very painful. June is telling Wa lly that he’s too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. In other word s, his skin is too light. It’s too white. He will get sunburned unless he has some pro tection. The word “outdoors” (outdoors) – one word – refers to the opposite of b eing inside. You are either indoors or outdoors. You’re either in a building or  a house, or you’re outside of a building or a house. I guess you could be in a car,  too.

Wally is “too fair to be outdoors for long without protection,” June says. “Protection” here would be something that prevents you from getting hurt – in this case, something that prevents you from getting a su nburn. Wally says, “I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine.” “Sunscreen” (suns creen) – one word – is a cream, lotion, or spray that you apply to your skin  that has special chemicals that will protect your skin, will prevent the skin from getting sunburned even if you are outside in the sun.

Now, sunscreens have different ratings depending on  how strong they are, how much protection they provide. This rating system is  called the “SPF” – the “Sun Protection Factor,” or indicator. The highest, or o ne of the highest, SPF numbers

you can get is 100. Someone like me, who has very f air skin, has to use a very high SPF sunscreen. June is worried more than just about Wally’s skin. She’s also worried about his lips, which can get sunburne d as well.

That’s why she says, “This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need that, too.” “ChapStick” (chapstick) is actually the name of a k ind of lip covering, or lip “balm” (balm), to protect your lips from getting dry, or i n this case, from getting sunburned. However, just like the word “Kleenex,” w hich is also the name of a kind of tissue, the word “ChapStick” is now often u sed to refer to any kind of lip balm – the way in some countries people talk about a “coca” when they are referring to any kind of soft drink.

Wally says, “All right. Anything else?” June says, “Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviole t rays.” “Sunglasses” are special glasses that have dark lenses, dark pieces of glass or plastic that cover your eyes to make sure that you can see more easily  when it is very sunny out and also that protect your eyes – at least, some su nglasses do. The sun has different kinds of light, different kinds of rays. One of them is “ultraviolet rays.” Ultraviolet rays or “ultraviolet light” is a kind of light that you can’t see – at least, human beings can’t see – but it can damage or hurt your skin and your eyes.

Wally says, “Okay, I’m leaving now.” He’s not very happy that June, who we guess is his mother, is telling him to do all of th ese things. He just wants to leave. He makes a little joke. He says, “I’m surprised you  didn’t get me some protective clothing.” “Protective clothing” would be special c lothing to protect you from the light of the sun. Wally says, “My arms and legs are  exposed.” “To be exposed” (exposed) means not to be protected or hidden or co vered.

June, however, responds, “I’m glad you reminded me.  Here’s a sun cape.” A “cape” (cape) is a large piece of fabric that you p ut around your neck and you tie it to your neck. It covers your shoulders. You can think of the famous superhero, Superman. Superman has a cape that he wears, or at least I’m told he wears it. So, June has gotten Wally this special cape, which of course would look ridiculous, especially on a man, unless you’re Supe rman.

June also says the cape is “made of breathable fabr ic.” “Fabric” (fabric) refers to the material that clothing is made out of. “Breatha ble (breathable) fabric,” would be fabric that allows air to pass through easily so  that you don’t sweat or get too hot. June wants Wally to wear this cape. She says, “Make sure you wear it every minute you’re outside. Promise?” The verb “to promi se” (promise) means to agree that you will do something – to say that you will do it, and if you don’t do it, you will accept some sort of consequence.

 When June says, “Promise?” she means, “Do you promi se to do these things?” Wally doesn’t respond. He just sighs. He goes [sigh ], which of course means he’s frustrated or angry with his mother.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

June: Wait! You forgot your sun hat.

Wally: I’m not wearing that hat. It looks ridiculou s on me.

June: It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays. You’re  too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t want to get another s unburn.

Wally: I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine.

June: This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need  that, too.

Wally: All right. Anything else?

June: Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.

Wally: Okay, I’m leaving now. I’m surprised you did n’t get me some protective clothing. My arms and legs are exposed.

June: I’m glad you reminded me. Here’s a sun cape. It’s made of a breathable fabric. Make sure you wear it every minute you’re o utside. Promise?

Wally: [sigh]

# Making Peace

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,122 – Making Peace.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,122. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Like us on Faceboo k at facebook.com/eslpod, and follow us on Twitter at @eslpod, of course.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e about two people trying to make peace – two countries trying to stop the disag reements between them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vladimir: We need a ceasefire. The violence is esca lating and we need to put a stop to this.

Hilary: I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce?

Vladimir: They’re as embattled as we are. They may welcome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.

Hilary: I hate to think what their conditions will be for an armistice. This war has dragged on for so long.

Vladimir: I suspect they feel the same as we do. If  we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they’ll respond in kind.

Hilary: Do you really think so? We won’t come off a s weak?

Vladimir: I don’t think so. We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that.

Hilary: If you say so. All right, let’s do it. This  war with our neighbors is getting old. Do you want to bring them this fruitcake or sh ould I?

Vladimir: I’ll take it, but first I’ll make sure th eir ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up. I don’t want to become a casualty while bringing them this peace offering!

 [end of dialogue]

Vladimir begins our dialogue by saying to Hilary, “ We need a ceasefire.” A “ceasefire” (ceasefire) is an agreement between two  countries, two nations, or two groups to stop fighting against each other temp orarily, for a little time. Sometimes there’s a ceasefire in order to try to en d the war between two countries or two groups. Sometimes the ceasefire is  for other reasons, but in any case, a ceasefire is when each side, each group, ce ases to fire on the other.

That’s where we get the noun “ceasefire” – from the  verb “to cease” (cease), which means to stop, and “to fire” (fire) which mea ns to shoot a bullet at someone else from a gun. At least, that’s what it n ormally means in the context of a war. Vladimir says, “We need a cease fire. The vi olence is escalating and we need to put a stop to this.” “Violence” is physical  behavior that is meant to hurt or even kill people, or to damage property, to damage things.

“To escalate” (escalate) means to quickly or sudden ly increase something in size, value, or even importance. On the Internet no wadays, when you have a problem and you contact the company, if the first p erson you contact isn’t able to help you, sometimes that person will “escalate” you r problem to a supervisor, to one of his or her bosses. So, we use the verb “to e scalate” to mean to either increase something in size, or to increase the impo rtance or to raise the importance of something. In some sort of battle, a conflict or war, “to escalate” would mean to increase the violence.

And that’s what Vladimir wants to avoid. He wants t o put a stop to the violence. “To put a stop to” something means to end it. Hilar y says, “I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce?” A “truce”  (truce) is an agreement between two people, two groups, or two or more coun tries to stop fighting each other. It’s sort of like a ceasefire. A truce, thou gh, is usually a signed agreement between two groups or two people, even – though nor mally we use it when we’re talking about two countries fighting each other.

Your “enemy” is the person you’re fighting against.  It’s the opposite of your friend. Not your friend on Facebook – that’s a diff erent thing. Vladimir says that their enemies (and notice that Vladimir and Hilary are “on the same side” – they’re with the same group) “are as embattled as w e are.” “To be embattled” (embattled) means to be involved in a war or prepar ed for a war. The word comes from the noun “battle” (battle) which is a fi ght between two sides – two disagreeing groups or two countries that are fighti ng each other.

Vladimir says, “They,” meaning the enemy, “may welc ome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.” A “suspension” (suspension) here means a period of time when you stop doing som ething. Here it would be a suspension of “hostilities” (hostilities). “Hostili ties” are angry, possibly violent actions against your enemy. Vladimir says that we can suspend the hostilities – we can have a “suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.”

A “treaty” (treaty) is a written, formal agreement between two or more countries that are in some sort of war or fighting between or  among the countries. So, a “peace treaty” would be a treaty that leads to peac e. After the two great World Wars of the twentieth century, there were peace tre aties among the countries who were fighting. Hilary says, “I hate to think wh at their conditions will be for an armistice.”

A “condition” is something that you have to agree t o when you sign an agreement. Often in business English we’ll talk abo ut “terms and conditions.” “Terms” refers to the meaning of things in the agre ement, the definition of certain words or phrases in an agreement. “Conditions” are the things that you have to do in order to carry out or in order to be part of the agreement.

An “armistice” (armistice) is the same as a peace t reaty or a truce. It’s an agreement to stop fighting. For many years in the U nited States, November 11th was celebrated as Armistice Day, in honor of the en d of the fighting in World War I. We changed the name – now we call it “Veterans D ay.” A “veteran” is a man or a woman who has fought in a war. Hilary says, “This  war has dragged on for so long.” “So long” here means very long. “To drag (dr ag) on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to last a very long time.

Vladimir says, “I suspect they feel the same as we do. If we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they will respond in kind.” A “con ciliatory (conciliatory) gesture (gesture)” is an attempt to make someone feel less angry, to calm someone down, to do something nice for someone with whom yo u have some disagreement or argument. Vladimir thinks that if t hey do that, if they make a conciliatory gesture, their enemies will respond in  kind. “In kind” here means in the same way.

Hilary says, “Do you really think so? Won’t we come  off as weak?” The expression “to come off as” something means to appe ar in a particular way, to be thought of or perceived in a certain way. Usually, but not always, I think we use this expression when the something that you come of f as is a negative quality. Here it would be coming off as being “weak” (weak),  meaning not strong. That’s

what Hilary is afraid of – that by making a concili atory gesture, they will come off as weak.

But Vladimir disagrees, “I don’t think so,” he says . “We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that.” Hilary says, “If you say so.” We use that expression “if you say so” usually when we don’t agree with the ot her person, but we don’t want to continue arguing about it. She then says, “All r ight, let’s do it. This war with our neighbors is getting old.” For something “to get ol d,” in this sense, means to become tiring, to no longer be interesting.

We learn at this point in the dialogue that we’re n ot talking about two different countries. We’re talking about two different famili es or households that live next to each other. Hilary says, “Do you want to bring t hem this fruitcake or should I?” Hilary is suggesting that they give a little gift t o their neighbors as a conciliatory gesture. One popular gift of food during the Christ mas holidays in the United States is, or used to be, fruitcake. It’s not actua lly a cake. It’s more like a thick bread.

My mother used to make fruitcake every year so that  we had something to give our teachers. I don’t think they liked it, particul arly. Some people don’t like fruitcake. I love fruitcake because I grew up eatin g it, I guess. Anyway, Vladimir says, “I’ll take it,” meaning I will take the fruit cake to our neighbors, “but first I’ll make sure their ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up.”

Now we learn the problem between these two neighbor s. The neighbors have a dog who is “mean” – that is, who is not very nice. The dog is also a “barking dog.” “To bark” (bark) is to make a sound like a dog, som ething like [barks]. Well, the barking dog of the neighbors is waking Vladimir up at night. He says he wants to make sure this dog is “tied up,” meaning there’s so me sort of rope around the dog so the dog won’t be able to attack him.

He says, “I don’t want to become a casualty while b ringing them this peace offering.” A “casualty” (casualty) is a person who was hurt or injured or killed in a war. Here, it means a person who is negatively affe cted by something – in this case, by the dog who might bite him. A “peace offer ing” (offering) is a gift or something you give another person with whom you had  a disagreement. It’s a way of trying to make a conciliatory gesture, a way  of trying to make peace with the other person.

In the words of John Lennon, “All we are saying, is  give peace a chance.” (You knew I was going to sing that, right?)

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vladimir: We need a ceasefire. The violence is esca lating and we need to put a stop to this.

Hilary: I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce?

Vladimir: They’re as embattled as we are. They may welcome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.

Hilary: I hate to think what their conditions will be for an armistice. This war has dragged on for so long.

Vladimir: I suspect they feel the same as we do. If  we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they’ll respond in kind.

Hilary: Do you really think so? We won’t come off a s weak?

Vladimir: I don’t think so. We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that.

Hilary: If you say so. All right, let’s do it. This  war with our neighbors is getting old. Do you want to bring them this fruitcake or sh ould I?

Vladimir: I’ll take it, but first I’ll make sure th eir ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up. I don’t want to become a casualty while bringing them this peace offering!

# Describing Pleasant Scents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,123 – Describing Pleasant Scents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,123. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  Special ESL Podcast Courses in Business and Daily English, and read our  ESL Podcast Blog each week. On this episode, we’re going to listen to a d ialogue between Kitty and Pepe about smells – about the way that things smell , the pleasant scents. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kitty: Oh, smell that. Isn’t that delectable?

Pepe: Yes, it’s pleasant.

Kitty: Pleasant? It’s heavenly. It has a nice fruit y scent, not too sweet.

Pepe: If you say so. I don’t want to buy anything t hat has a strong perfume smell. I’m a guy.

Kitty: I know, but you want to exude a sexy scent t hat captivates the opposite sex, right?

Pepe: I’m not sure about that. I just want to smell  fresh and clean.

Kitty: All right, how about this one?

Pepe: Uh, it smells musky.

Kitty: Musky is good. Musky is sexy.

Pepe: Not to me. Let’s stick with something basic. I’m buying this one.

Kitty: But that one smells like detergent!

Pepe: Yes, because that’s what I’m buying – deterge nt for my clothes. I don’t need any fancy scents on my clothes.

Kitty: Have it your way, but you’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.

Pepe: I’ll pass up that chance, thank you very much . If I follow your advice and buy this perfume-smelling detergent, women will def initely get the wrong idea about me!

[end of dialogue]

Kitty begins our dialogue by saying to Pepe, “Oh, s mell that.” “To smell,” of course, means to breathe air into your nose so you can get the flavor of something or the “scent” (scent) of something. The scent of something is the way it smells, especially if it smells good. We often t alk about, say, perfume for a woman as having a certain scent. Kitty says, “The s mell is delectable” (delectable). “Delectable” is another word for “del icious” – something that has a very good taste.

Pepe says, “Yes, it’s pleasant” (pleasant). “Pleasa nt” means nice. It means comfortable, but it isn’t a very strong compliment.  It isn’t a very strong idea. If you say something is pleasant, you mean it’s okay – it’ s nice, but it’s not great. That’s why Kitty is surprised. She says, “Pleasant? It’s h eavenly.” “Heavenly” refers to something that is perfect, something that is really  good.

She says, “It has a nice fruity scent, not too swee t.” “Fruity” (fruity) refers to the tastes and smells of fruit. Kitty is describing som ething as having a “fruity scent, not too sweet.” We usually think of fruit as being sweet, as having certain sugars in it that make it sweet. Pepe says, “If you say so .” We’ve heard this expression before. When someone says, “If you say so,” he’s re ally saying, “I don’t agree with you, but I’m not going to argue with you, eith er.”

Pepe says, “I don’t want to buy anything that has a  strong perfume smell.” “Perfume” (perfume) is a kind of scented liquid tha t a woman sprays on her body to make her smell good. Men don’t normally wear per fume, or at least they don’t call it perfume. The word “perfume” in English only  refers to the liquid that a woman would put on her body. Pepe says he doesn’t want anything that smells like perfume. “I’m a guy,” he says – I’m a man.

Kitty says, “I know, but you want to exude a sexy s cent that captivates the opposite sex.” “To exude” (exude) means to convey o r display. It’s for something

to be sent out from your body. You could say that a  certain person “exudes confidence.” It’s almost as though the confidence w ere a scent that was coming out of the person’s body. The idea is that it’s ver y obvious. If you exude confidence, you are a very confident person. You lo ok confident. Well, here we’re not talking about confidence, we’re talking about a  “sexy scent.” “Sexy” (sexy) refers to things that people consider sexually attr active.

Kitty wants Pepe to have a “sexy scent that captiva tes the opposite sex.” “To captivate” (captivate) means to get someone’s atten tion so that he or she can’t concentrate on anything else. You may see a beautif ul woman and find her beauty captivating. You can’t focus on anything els e. Of course, I’m referring to your wife or girlfriend. Kitty is trying to get Pep e to captivate the opposite sex. The term “opposite sex” refers to, for a woman, a m an, and for a man, a woman.

Pepe is a little doubtful. He says, “I’m not sure a bout that. I just want to smell fresh and clean.” “To smell fresh” (fresh) means the same as to smell new or clean – not dirty in this case. Kitty says, “All ri ght, how about this one?” Pepe says, “Uh, it smells musky” (musky). “Musky” means having the scent of a male animal. Some people think it’s a pleasant smell, so me people don’t. Kitty thinks it is. She says, “Musky is good. Musky is sexy.” It’s how a man should smell, according to Kitty.

Pepe says, however, “Not to me,” meaning it isn’t g ood for me. “Let’s stick with something basic.” “To stick with” something means t o concentrate or focus on – to not try other things. He says, “I’m buying this one.” Kitty, however, says, “But that one smells like detergent!” “Detergent” (deter gent) is soap that you use to wash either clothing or dishes. Pepe says, “Yes, be cause that’s what I’m buying – detergent for my clothes.” Now we learn what Pepe  is actually buying at the store. He’s buying detergent to wash his clothes.

He adds, “I don’t need any fancy scents on my cloth es,” meaning he doesn’t need his clothes to smell of something. Kitty says,  “Have it your way.” That’s an expression we use to indicate that the other person  should just do what he or she wants, but that you would do something different. You are expressing disagreement with the other person, but telling the  other person to go ahead and do what he or she wants to do.

There was actually a commercial when I was growing up for one of the big hamburger restaurants – not McDonald’s, but Burger King. Burger King had advertisements that tried to emphasize that if you went to Burger King you could get your hamburger made however you wanted it.

Have it your way, have it your way at Burger King.

I remember that. That was from, like, the 1970s. Ca n you believe that? Anyway that’s how effective advertising can be, you see. You get that song in your head and you can’t get rid of it, right? Even after 40 y ears.

Well, back to the story. Pepe doesn’t want to buy t he detergent that Kitty likes. Kitty says to him, “You’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.” “To miss out on” something is not to have t he opportunity to do something, especially because you’ve made a certain  decision. If you’re going to miss out on the party, you’re going to not have fun  at the party with everyone else because you’ve decided not to go. You’re going  to miss out. You’re going to lose the opportunity to do something good or positi ve.

Kitty thinks that Pepe will miss out on the chance,  the opportunity, to lure women. “To lure” (lure) means to bring someone closer to y ou by offering the person something attractive or rewarding. It could also be  used for an animal. “To lure an animal” would be to get an animal to come close to you, perhaps because you want to capture the animal. When we’re talking abou t humans, we often use this verb when we’re describing making yourself attracti ve to another romantic partner or to someone who you would like to be your  romantic partner.

Pepe, however, says, “I’ll pass up that chance.” “T o pass up” something, or “to pass something up,” means to decide not to do somet hing or to have something. He says, “If I follow your advice and buy this perf ume-smelling detergent, women will definitely get the wrong idea about me.” He’s saying that women will think something different about him than what, I guess, K itty thinks women will think about him. It’s confusing. I know.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kitty: Oh, smell that. Isn’t that delectable?

Pepe: Yes, it’s pleasant.

Kitty: Pleasant? It’s heavenly. It has a nice fruit y scent, not too sweet.

Pepe: If you say so. I don’t want to buy anything t hat has a strong perfume smell. I’m a guy.

Kitty: I know, but you want to exude a sexy scent t hat captivates the opposite sex, right?

Pepe: I’m not sure about that. I just want to smell  fresh and clean.

Kitty: All right, how about this one?

Pepe: Uh, it smells musky.

Kitty: Musky is good. Musky is sexy.

Pepe: Not to me. Let’s stick with something basic. I’m buying this one.

Kitty: But that one smells like detergent!

Pepe: Yes, because that’s what I’m buying – deterge nt for my clothes. I don’t need any fancy scents on my clothes.

Kitty: Have it your way, but you’re missing out on a chance to lure women with your scent.

Pepe: I’ll pass up that chance, thank you very much . If I follow your advice and buy this perfume-smelling detergent, women will def initely get the wrong idea about me!

# Hiding Money Offshore

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,124 – Hiding Money Offshore.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,124. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com and check out our S pecial Courses in Business and Daily English in our ESL Podcast Store .

This episode is a dialogue between Sabrina and Luis  about hiding your money so the government doesn’t find it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sabrina: Wait! Don’t deposit that money into our re gular bank account. I’ll take care of it.

Luis: Okay, but why?

Sabrina: I’ve come up with a way for us to avoid pa ying so much in taxes each year. I’ve opened an offshore account in the Crook Islands. We can funnel our money into that account and it’ll be untraceable.

Luis: But that’s tax evasion.

Sabrina: The banks in the Crook Islands have ways of covering up the paper trail so no one will be the wiser.

Luis: That doesn’t make it legal.

Sabrina: They haven’t caught us yet.

Luis: You mean you’ve already started putting money  into that account?

Sabrina: I’ve been depositing money into it for nea rly a year.

Luis: And when were you going to tell me?

Sabrina: I’m telling you now. Trust me. These tax h avens are very popular with the rich. We’re just taking a page from their book on how to save money.

Luis: We’re going to get caught. We should come cle an now.

Sabrina: That’s why I didn’t tell you before! I kne w you’d make a fuss about it.

Luis: And you were right. We need to quietly close the account and bring the money back.

Sabrina: Then we’ll have to pay taxes on it and may be even a penalty, more than we would’ve had to pay in taxes originally.

Luis: Right, and that’s called poetic justice.

[end of dialogue]

Sabrina says to Luis, “Wait! Don’t deposit that money into our regular bank account. I’ll take care of it.” “To deposit” (depos it) money into a bank account means to put money into your account – to give the bank money that the bank will keep for you until you need it. A “bank accoun t” (account) is basically an agreement or arrangement that you have with the ban k, where you can give them money and they will hold it for you, or at lea st give it back to you when you want it.

The bank doesn’t actually keep all the money people  give it. It, of course, lends the money to other people; it gives loans to people  and then makes money on your money. Well, in our dialogue, Sabrina doesn’t want Luis to deposit a certain amount of money into their regular or normal bank a ccount. Luis is confused. He says, “Okay, but why?” Sabrina says, “I’ve come up with a way,” meaning I have found or invented a way, “for us to avoid paying so  much in taxes each year.”

“Taxes” (taxes) is the money you pay to the governm ent. Usually it’s some percentage of your income – how much you make, how much money you earn each year. California, for example, has some of the  highest taxes because not only does the national government make you pay taxe s but most states also make you pay taxes. So, if you live in California, you pay relatively high taxes. Anyway, enough complaining about California.

Sabrina says, “I’ve opened an offshore account in t he Crook Islands.” An “offshore (offshore) account” is one that is in ano ther country, not the country you live in. It is possible to put your money in banks in other countries so that the

government doesn’t know how much money you really h ave. Well, that’s what Sabrina’s idea is. She’s actually opened an offshor e account in a fictional, imaginary place called the “Crook Islands.” The wor d “crook” (crook) is used in English to mean a thief, someone who steals somethi ng. So it’s a little joke here in our dialogue that Sabrina has put her money in a  bank in the Crook Islands.

Sabrina continues, “We can funnel our money into th at account and it’ll be untraceable.” “To funnel” (funnel) money is to send  something to one place or one person even when it comes from different places . You could take the money that you make, plus your wife makes, plus your frie nds make and you could funnel it into a single account. You would put it a ll into one account. A “funnel” (funnel) as a noun is something you use to pour liq uid into a container so that all the liquid goes into it. It’s like a cone, basicall y, if you remember your high school geometry.

Sabrina says that putting the money into this offsh ore account will make it “untraceable.” “Traceable” (traceable) means you ca n figure out where something comes from. “Untraceable” would mean that  you could not figure out where something came from. Well, if your money is “ untraceable,” it means the government can’t find it, can’t figure out what hap pened to it. Luis objects. He’s not sure this is a good idea. He says, “That’s a ta x evasion.” “Tax evasion” (evasion) is illegally trying to avoid paying taxes  to the government – by hiding your money, for example.

Don’t confuse tax evasion with “tax avoidance” (avo idance). “Tax avoidance” is when you legally try to pay the minimum amount of t axes possible. “Tax evasion” is when you illegally try to do the same thing. Sab rina says, “The banks in the Crook Islands have ways of covering up the paper tr ail so no one will be the wiser.” The phrasal verb “to cover up” means to hid e something so that it cannot be seen, especially something illegal – to make sur e that no one discovers illegal activities.

One of the problems very common in American politic s is that politicians will do something wrong – something dumb, but something tha t is not illegal. However, because they don’t want anyone to know about it, th ey try to cover it up, and often that is illegal, especially if the government  starts asking questions and you lie to the government. Well, the lying is illegal, and that is often what is a problem for some American politicians. Anyway, enough of Am erica’s problems. Back to our dialogue.

Sabrina says that these banks in the Crook Islands have ways of covering up the “paper trail” (trail). The term “paper trail” refer s to documents and other written

evidence that shows where someone has been and what  that person has done. Nowadays we don’t use paper as much. I guess you co uld call it the “electronic trail,” but we still call it the “paper trail.” It means evidence of things that you have done that, say, the police can discover and determi ne what exactly you did.

Sabrina says these banks cover up the paper trail “ so no one will be the wiser” (wiser). “To be wise” (wise) means to be smart, to be knowledgeable. “No one will be the wiser” is a phrase meaning no one will find out what happened. No one will be able to discover the truth. Luis says, “That doesn’t make it legal.” Sabrina says, “They,” meaning the government, “have n’t caught us yet.” Luis says, “You mean you’ve already started putting mone y into that account?”

Sabrina responds, “I’ve been depositing money into it for nearly a year.” Luis says, “And when were you going to tell me?” So, Lui s says this plan that Sabrina has is illegal. But Sabrina says, “Well, they haven ’t caught us yet,” meaning they haven’t found out what we have been doing. Luis is surprised that Sabrina has already started putting money into this illegal acc ount, and he asks, “When were you going to tell me?”

Sabrina says, “I’m telling you now. Trust me. These  tax havens are very popular with the rich.” A “tax haven” (haven) is a place wh ere you can put your money, a country where you can put your money and you don’t have to pay taxes on it, or you pay very little in tax. Sabrina says, “We are j ust taking a page from their book on how to save money.” The expression “to take a pa ge from someone’s book” means to study what other people have done and do t he same thing – to copy what someone else is doing.

Luis says, “We’re going to get caught.” “To get cau ght” means to have someone find out about something that you did wrong. Luis s ays, “We should come clean now.” “To come clean” means to admit what you did w rong, to say that you have done something illegal or wrong, to tell someone el se. Sabrina says, “That’s why I didn’t tell you before. I knew you’d make a fuss about it.” “To make a fuss” (fuss) is to complain about something or to become angry about something. It’s to not react calmly, to get all excited about somet hing in a bad way.

Luis says, “And you were right,” meaning yes, I am making a fuss about this; I am getting angry and complaining about it. He says,  “We need to quietly close the account and bring the money back,” meaning take  the money out of the bank in the Crook Islands and bring it back to the Unite d States. Sabrina says, however, “Then we’ll have to pay taxes on it and ma ybe even a penalty, more than we would have had to pay in taxes originally.”

Sabrina is complaining that if they bring this mone y back to the United States, they may have to pay taxes on it plus what’s called  a “penalty” (penalty). A penalty is a punishment for breaking a rule or a la w. Sabrina complains this amount of money they will have to pay will be more than what they would have had to pay in taxes originally if they had not trie d to hide their money.

Luis says, “Right,” meaning that’s correct, “and th at’s called poetic justice.” The phrase “poetic (poetic) justice” refers to a negati ve consequence, a bad result that happens from something you do that is an appro priate punishment for your bad actions. So in this case, the couple – Sabrina and Luis – may have to pay more in taxes by bringing the money back than they would have had to pay if they had just paid their taxes legally here in the United States. Luis calls that “poetic justice” because they deserve it. It’s a de served outcome, an appropriate punishment for what they did wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sabrina: Wait! Don’t deposit that money into our re gular bank account. I’ll take care of it.

Luis: Okay, but why?

Sabrina: I’ve come up with a way for us to avoid pa ying so much in taxes each year. I’ve opened an offshore account in the Crook Islands. We can funnel our money into that account and it’ll be untraceable.

Luis: But that’s tax evasion.

# Serving Alcoholic Drinks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,125 – Serving Alcoholic Drinks.

This episode is a dialogue between Bethany and Nath an about giving someone something alcoholic to drink. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bethany: Where is everybody?

Nathan: While you were in the bathroom, the other g uys left.

Bethany: In that case, I should go, too. It’s getti ng late.

Nathan: The night is young. Let me get you a refill .

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t have another drink.  I had a neat drink after dinner and I’m still feeling the effects. I’m a lightweigh t and I’m not normally a drinker.

Nathan: What’s the harm? Have one for the road. I’l l serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon. It’s my specialty. I cou ld also mix you a cocktail, if you prefer. Consider it a nightcap.

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t.

Nathan: All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand.

Bethany: No, it’s late, I’m tired, and I have to go .

Nathan: Don’t rush off. You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for being a spoilsport, would you?

 Bethany: I prefer that to the alternative!

[end of dialogue]

Bethany starts the dialogue by saying, “Where is ev erybody?” Nathan replies, “While you were in the bathroom, the other guys lef t” – the other people who were here. Remember that the word “guy” (guy) in Am erican English can mean a man – a male – but it can also just mean a group of  men and women, or boys and girls, I suppose. Bethany says, “In that case, I should go, too. It’s getting late.” Bethany is saying that she should go home be cause it is getting late and everyone else has left also.

But Nathan doesn’t want her to go. He says, “The ni ght is young.” That expression “The night is young” is used when you do n’t want to go home after going to a party or doing something else. It’s used  to encourage someone else to stay out later with you, to perhaps go to a bar or go dancing. “The night is young” – that means it’s early in the evening. We wouldn’t  say this during the day, of course. It would have to be after, say, six o’clock  p.m.

Bethany wants to go home, but Nathan wants her to s tay. He says, “Let me get you a refill.” The verb “to refill” (refill) means to put more liquid in someone’s glass – in this case, to serve someone another alco holic drink. The noun “refill” refers to that liquid which goes into your glass. B ethany says, “No, I really shouldn’t have another drink. I had a neat drink af ter dinner and I’m still feeling the effects.”

This phrase or term “a neat (neat) drink” is one us ed mostly by what we would call “bartenders” – people who work behind a bar se rving you alcohol in a bar or a pub. A “neat drink” is a drink that is only made of one kind of alcohol. It’s not mixed with anything. It’s not mixed with water or j uice or ice or anything else. So, for example, if you wanted just whisky, you could g et the bartender to give you a small glass of whisky. If it were a “neat drink,” it wouldn’t have any ice in it.

Now, I don’t go to bars very much anymore, and to b e honest, I had never heard of this term “neat drink” before today. There’s a s imilar term that I think most Americans would be familiar with, which is “straigh t up.” A drink served “straight up” is also one in which there is no ice or other l iquids. However, the bartender makes the drink cold first by putting ice into it a nd then taking it out, basically. So, that’s the difference between a “neat drink” and a drink “straight up.”

Bethany says she had a neat drink after dinner and she’s still “feeling the effects.” She says, “I’m a lightweight and I’m not normally a drinker.” If someone says they’re a “lightweight” (lightweight) – one wo rd – he means he can’t drink very much alcohol without it affecting him, that ev en a little bit of alcohol will make him a little dizzy or will get him, what we wo uld call, “drunk” (drunk), which is when you drink in so much alcohol you begin to l ose your ability to function normally.

Bethany says she is a lightweight and “not normally  a drinker” – that is, a person who drinks a lot of alcohol, such as beer or wine o r whiskey or vodka or whatever one likes to drink. Nathan says, “What’s the harm?”  What bad could happen from doing it? He says, “Have one for the road.” The exp ression “one for the road” refers to one last drink before you leave. That’s n ot, of course, a very good idea – to be drinking if you are going to have to drive af terwards. I guess if you’re taking a taxi, it’s okay.

Nathan wants to give Bethany “one for the road.” He  says, “I’ll serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon.” Remember, w e said “straight up” means that the drink has just one kind of alcohol, but is  made cold first by putting ice in it and then taking the ice out. I’m not quite sure why  you would have a drink straight up with a twist of lemon; if there were a twist of lemon, it wouldn’t be a drink straight up, I don’t think. But then again, I  don’t drink very much.

Well, what is a “twist (twist) of lemon”? A twist of lemon is a small amount of the fruit – lemon – that is squeezed into the drink. Of ten they will put the little piece of lemon – a little, what we would call, “slice” (slic e) of lemon – into the drink after it has been squeezed into the drink. Nathan says, “It’ s my specialty.” Your “specialty” is what you are very good at doing.

He continues, “I could also mix you a cocktail if y ou prefer.” A “cocktail” (cocktail) is a drink that contains two or more ingredients. I t could be two different kinds of alcohol. It could be alcohol and water, or alcohol and juice, or alcohol and soda. “To mix” means to combine these two ingredients tog ether – the two kinds of alcohol or the two kinds of liquid that are in the drink.

Nathan says, “Consider it a nightcap.” A “nightcap”  (nightcap) is an alcoholic drink that you drink right before going to bed to h elp you fall asleep. Bethany says, “No, I really shouldn’t.” This is a very poli te way of telling someone that you don’t want to do what that person wants you to do. Bethany doesn’t want to have another drink. Nathan keeps insisting. So Bethany s ays, “No, I really shouldn’t.”

Nathan finally says, “All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand.” “To top off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to put more liquid into your glass of the same type when you haven’t finished drinking what’s alre ady in your glass. So, for example, if you have a cocktail of, I don’t know, w hiskey and soda. Someone says, “Let me top off your drink.” The person is of fering to put more whisky and soda into your glass until your glass is full again .

Bethany however, says, “No, it’s late. I’m tired an d I have to go.” So, she’s very direct now with Nathan, telling Nathan no, she does n’t want to have another drink. But Nathan says, “Don’t rush off.” “To rush (rush) off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to leave suddenly or to leave in a hur ry, to leave quickly. Nathan says, “You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for be ing a spoilsport, would you? A “reputation” here refers to how other people percei ve you, what you are known for. You can have a good reputation or you can have  a bad reputation.

A “spoilsport” (spoilsport) – one word – is a perso n who ruins other people’s fun, who behaves in a way that makes something less enjo yable than it should be. If you’re at a party and everyone wants to play a game  and you say, “Ah, no, I don’t want to play,” someone may call you a “spoilsport.”  You are spoiling or ruining the game or the situation for everyone else. Nathan  is telling Bethany that if she leaves now, she’ll get the reputation for being a s poilsport.

Bethany, however, says, “I prefer that to the alter native.” An “alternative” (alternative) is another possibility, another optio n, another thing you can do if one thing doesn’t work or is not successful. Here what Bethany means is that she would rather have the reputation for being a spoils port than being the kind of person who keeps drinking as the night goes on – at  least, I think that’s what she means.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bethany: Where is everybody?

Nathan: While you were in the bathroom, the other g uys left.

Bethany: In that case, I should go, too. It’s getti ng late.

Nathan: The night is young. Let me get you a refill .

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t have another drink.  I had a neat drink after dinner and I’m still feeling the effects. I’m a lightweigh t and I’m not normally a drinker.

Nathan: What’s the harm? Have one for the road. I’l l serve this one straight up and with a twist of lemon. It’s my specialty. I cou ld also mix you a cocktail, if you prefer. Consider it a nightcap.

Bethany: No, I really shouldn’t.

Nathan: All right, I’ll just top off that drink in your hand.

Bethany: No, it’s late, I’m tired, and I have to go .

Nathan: Don’t rush off. You wouldn’t want to get a reputation for being a spoilsport, would you?

Bethany: I prefer that to the alternative!

# Using a Pawnshop

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,126 – Using a Pawnshop.

This is English as a Second Language podcast episod e 1,126. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. (I don’t know. N ot enough coffee this morning. Sorry.)

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. You can become a member of ESL Podcast when you do that. This episode is a dialogue about using a pawnshop – a store where you can bring your old items and get money for them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jamaica: I need to raise some cash right away. I’m thinking of hocking a few things. You’ve used the pawnshop down the street be fore, right?

Nolan: Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job. I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one.

Jamaica: Is the place legit?

Nolan: It seemed to be. I have no complaints.

Jamaica: That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?

Nolan: It’s pretty simple. You bring the pawnbroker  something that’s worth money to use as collateral and then you get a loan for a fraction of its value. Then, you have 90 days to repay the loan, plus interest and f ees.

Jamaica: How do I redeem my item?

Nolan: You just show them your pawn ticket.

Jamaica: That sounds pretty simple. What if I can’t  repay the money by the deadline?

Nolan: Then you forfeit your item. The pawnshop tri es to sell it to recoup the money they lent you.

Jamaica: Okay, I’m going to do it. I’m going to paw n my collection.

Nolan: Your collection of what?

Jamaica: Action figures. I have the entire collecti on of ESL Podcast action figures. There’s Jeff, Lucy, Warren, Jessica, Adria no, Pao, LeeAnn, Alison . . .

Nolan: I said something worth money, remember?

[end of dialogue]

Jamaica says to Nolan, “I need to raise some cash r ight away.” “To raise (raise) cash,” or “to raise money,” means to get money for some specific purpose. Certain organizations, for example, try to raise mo ney to support the goals and activities of the organization. If a person, an ind ividual, says that she wants to raise cash or needs “to raise some cash right away, ” as Jamaica says, usually she means that she needs money for some specific re ason.

Jamaica says, “I’m thinking of hocking a few things .” The verb “to hock” (hock) means to leave something usually at a place called a “pawn (pawn) shop” in exchange for money. Basically what you are doing is  giving the pawnshop, say, a ring or a computer or something valuable in exchang e for money that the pawnshop gives to you. Now, usually a pawnshop will  keep what you give them for a certain number of days or weeks, and if you d on’t come back and buy it back – give them money to get your item back – well , the pawnshop will then sell it to someone else.

Pawnshops are popular still in the United States in  some neighborhoods, especially poorer neighborhoods where people often need to get money and so they try to sell – or we would even use the verb “p awn” – their items. The verb “to pawn” means the same is the verb “to hock.” Jamaica  says, “You’ve used the pawnshop down the street before, right?” Nolan says , “Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job.” People don’t usually use a paw nshop unless they really need money badly. They don’t want to get rid of their va luable things, but they don’t have a choice sometimes.

Nolan says, “I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one” – that is, a new job. Many people use pawnshop s basically as a way of getting a loan for something they need money for ri ght now. Then they try to get money together to buy whatever it is that they gave  to the pawnshop back. Nolan says he needed a “short-term loan,” meaning money t hat you give someone for

only a short period of time. It might be a month. I t might be two months. It might be a year.

“To tide someone over” means to help someone throug h a difficult situation. If someone says, “I need $100 to tide me over until to morrow,” the person is telling you that he needs $100 in order to pay his bills an d expenses until tomorrow. If you’re lucky, you’ll get your money back tomorrow.

Nolan says he needed a short-term loan to tide him over until he could find a new job. Jamaica says, “Is the place legit?” The word “ legit” (legit) is short for an informal way of saying “legitimate” (legitimate).”L egitimate” means real, something that is not fake, something that is what it says it is.

Nolan says, “It seemed to be. I have no complaints. ” A “complaint” (complaint) is a statement that you are dissatisfied, disappointed , or unhappy with something. If someone says, “I have no complaints,” the person me ans that he was happy (with, in this case, the pawnshop). Jamaica says, “ That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?” “To go about” means to do . “How would I pawn something?” is what Jamaica is asking here.

Nolan says, “It’s pretty simple,” meaning it’s very  simple. “You bring the pawnbroker something that’s worth money to use as c ollateral, and then you get a loan for a fraction of its value.” A “pawnbroker”  (pawnbroker) is a person who owns a pawnshop. Nolan says, “You give the pawnbrok er something that’s worth money” – something that has value, maybe an old rin g or a phone or a computer. That thing, that item, is used as collateral. “Coll ateral” (collateral) is something that you give someone in order to get a loan. It’s something that we would say “secures” the loan.

For example, if you want to buy a car, and you want  to get a loan for the car, a bank may ask you for collateral. They may ask you, in other words, for something that’s worth money, so in case you don’t pay the lo an back, they can get their money back. Now, the car itself may serve as collat eral. For example, when you buy a house, when you get a loan to buy the house, the house itself is your collateral. If you don’t pay the loan back, the ban k will take your house. So, collateral is something worth something that allows  you to get a loan.

In a pawnshop, whatever you bring to the pawnbroker  is your collateral, and the pawnbroker will then give you money as a loan. But the pawnbroker won’t give you 100 percent of what the item is worth. The pawn broker will only give you “a fraction of its value.” A “fraction” (fraction) is a term from mathematics that refers to a part of something, a portion of something. One -half, one-third, one-

hundredth – those are all “fractions,” percentages of the whole amount. “Value” (value) is what something is worth, how much money it is worth.

Nolan says, “Then, you have 90 days to repay the lo an, plus interest and fees.” “To repay (repay) a loan” means to give the person who gave you the loan the money back. You’re giving him the money that he gav e you. Now, when you go to a pawnbroker, you have to give the money that the pawn broker gave you plus “interest,” which is basically the price of the loa n. It may be 1 percent, it maybe 10 percent.

Jamaica says, “How do I redeem my item?” “To redeem ” (redeem) in this case means to get something back that you originally own ed. At a pawnshop, it means to get back what you gave the pawnbroker in order t o get the loan. Nolan says, “You just show them your pawn ticket.” When you giv e something to a pawnbroker, the pawnbroker will give you a little p iece of paper called a “ticket” that usually has a number on it, and you bring that  back and the pawnbroker can find your item in order to give it back to you – af ter, of course, you’ve paid the pawnbroker the money that he lent you.

Jamaica says, “That sounds pretty simple. What if I  can’t repay the money by the deadline?” That is, what if 90 days goes by and you  don’t have money to get your item back? Nolan says, “Then you forfeit your item. ” “To forfeit” (forfeit) means to lose something, especially as a punishment for fail ing to do something. In this case, it means you no longer own the item that you gave to the pawnbroker. You can no longer get it back, at least not by just pay ing the loan amount.

Nolan says, “The pawnshop tries to sell it to recou p the money they lent you.” So, if you give the pawnshop your wedding ring in order  to get a short-term loan, and you are not able to pay the loan back, the pawnshop  will sell your wedding ring to someone else. Maybe your wife will buy it. Who know s?

Nolan says the pawnshop sells things “to recoup” th eir money. “To recoup” (recoup) means to recover something, to get somethi ng back that was lost. In this case, the pawnshop needs to get back the money  that they lent you that you did not pay them back. Jamaica says, “Okay, I’m going to do it. I’m going to pawn my collection.” A “collection” is a set of objects that are related to each other. Some people like to collect coins. Some people like  to collect dolls. Some people like to collect old magazines.

What does Jamaica collect? Action figures. “Action figures” are little toys that are in the shape of a person or some character. Often, in movies for children, the movie studio – the company that makes the movie – w ill sell little toys, little action

figures, and you can move the little arms and the l ittle legs, and of course your children are going to want to buy them because they  saw the movie.

Jamaica collects action figures of ESL Podcast char acters. She says, “There’s Jeff, Lucy, Warren, Jessica, Adriano, Pao, LeeAnn, Alison . . .” In other words, Jamaica has, apparently, action figures of those of  us who work on ESL Podcast. I didn’t even know these existed, but I guess they do, because it’s in the dialogue. Jamaica wants to sell these things – or p awn these things, rather – to the pawnshop.

But Nolan interrupts her and says, “I said somethin g worth money, remember?” Nolan is I think making a joke here. He’s saying th at action figures from ESL Podcast would not be worth any money, and the pawnb roker wouldn’t give you any money if you tried to hock or pawn them at his pawnshop. Well, I think they’d be worth a lot of money. Don’t you?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Jamaica: I need to raise some cash right away. I’m thinking of hocking a few things. You’ve used the pawnshop down the street be fore, right?

Nolan: Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job. I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one.

Jamaica: Is the place legit?

Nolan: It seemed to be. I have no complaints.

Jamaica: That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?

Jamaica: How do I redeem my item?

Jamaica: That sounds pretty simple. What if I can’t  repay the money by the deadline?

 Nolan: Then you forfeit your item. The pawnshop tri es to sell it to recoup the money they lent you.

# Paying for College

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,127 – Paying for College.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,127. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store. While you’re there, you can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Blog. If you’re on Facebook, you can like us on Facebook. Go to facebook.com/esl pod.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Chris and Marcella about getting enough money to go to college. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chris: Which colleges are you applying to?

Marcella: None. I can’t afford to go to college. Ev en if I lived at home, tuition, fees, and books are just too expensive.

Chris: You could apply for financial aid.

Marcella: I don’t want to get a bunch of loans and be in debt for the next 10 to 20 years. It’s not worth it.

Chris: Loans aren’t so bad, especially ones that are federally subsidized. Apart from that, you could get need-based grants or work- study. Put all of that together and college can be affordable.

Marcella: I don’t want to go into debt of any kind.

Chris: You could go to a community college and tran sfer to a four-year university after two years. Community college tuition is much lower.

Marcella: But who has the time? I have to work full -time to pay my bills.

Chris: Then think about a program that has a servic e commitment.

Marcella: What do you mean?

 Chris: There are teaching, military, or community s ervice programs that will forgive or pay off your loans if you work for the o rganization for a few years after graduating.

Marcella: And be an indentured servant? No, thank y ou!

Chris: Okay, but most good jobs nowadays require a college degree.

Marcella: Not if you really have talent.

Chris: Talent?

Marcella: Yeah, haven’t you seen me mime? That’s my  ticket to a great career.

Chris: I’m happy to hear you have such a practical plan mapped out for your future.

[end of dialogue]

Chris asks Marcella, “Which colleges are you applyi ng to?” Which colleges are you trying to get into, are sending applications to ? Marcella says, “None. I can’t afford to go to college.” Marcella says she “can’t afford to go to college,” meaning she doesn’t have any money. She says, “Even if I li ved at home, tuition fees and books are just too expensive.” “Tuition” (tuition) is the money that you pay to a school, including a college or university, to be a student there. It’s the money you pay for your classes.

Usually, American universities charge a certain amo unt of money for a full-time student, which allows that student to take anywhere  between three and five classes. Of course, you want to take as many classe s as possible to get the most from your money. Not all colleges work that way. So me colleges will charge you for each class you take, so it doesn’t really make a difference, but that’s the idea of “tuition.” It’s money you pay to a school so tha t you can be a student there.

Chris says, “You could apply for financial aid.” “F inancial aid” (aid) is money that is either given to a student by the college, an org anization, or the government, or money that is loaned to a student by a bank or the government to pay for the costs of being a student. That would include tuitio n, living expenses, books, and so forth. The national or federal government has a financial aid program that it uses to give money to students all over the country .

Each state also typically has a financial aid progr am, so a student may be getting money from the federal government as well as the st ate government. And of course, individual universities also will sometimes  give students money, although most of the financial aid comes from either the fed eral or the state government, either in the form of what we call “grants” (grants ) or loans. A “grant” is money the government gives you and you don’t have to pay it back. It’s like a gift.

Marcella says, “I don’t want to get a bunch of loan s and be in debt for the next 10 to 20 years. It’s not worth it.” A “loan” (loan) is , you probably know, money that someone gives you temporarily, with the idea that y ou will give that money back to the person. “To be in debt” (debt) – notice the “b” is silent – means to owe money to other people or to a bank. “To be in debt”  means that you have to pay money back to people. It means that you have loans,  that is. Marcella says she does not want to be in debt for the next 10 to 20 y ears. She says, “It’s not worth it” – it’s not something that I think is a good ide a for my future.

Chris says, however, “Loans aren’t so bad,” meaning  it’s not that bad for you to get a loan, “especially,” he continues, “ones that are federally subsidized.” “To be subsidized” (subsidized) means to receive financial  support from some other organization, especially from the government. In “f ederally subsidized loans,” the government pays some of the interest on the loan. “ Interest” on a loan is money you pay to borrow the money. It’s like the price of  the loan. The “federally subsidized loans” are loans for which the U.S. nati onal, or federal, government will pay a certain amount of the interest on it.

Chris says, “Apart from that,” meaning separate fro m that, “you could get need- based grants or work-study.” Something that is “nee d (need) – based (based)” is something that depends upon how much money you make  or have. A “need- based grant” is money that the government gives you  based upon how poor you are.

“Work-study” is a special program that, again, the government often pays for, where you work on the campus of the university or c ollege. You work when you are a student for the college, doing things like cl eaning and working in the library and helping out in the offices. That would be a wor k-study situation, and that’s a kind of financial aid. They only give those jobs to  the students who need them.

Chris says, “Put all of that together,” meaning com bine all of those things, “and college can be affordable.” Something that is “affo rdable” (affordable) is something that is not too expensive. It doesn’t cos t too much money. You can pay for it. You have enough money for it. Marcella says, “I don’t want to go into debt of any kind.” Marcella doesn’t want to have an y loans is what she’s saying.

 Chris says, “You could go to a community college an d transfer to a four-year university after two years. Community college tuiti on is much lower.” A “community college” – what we used to call a “junio r college” in most states – is a college that usually has only two years of schoolin g available. Many times community colleges will offer what’s called an “AA”  or an “Associate of Arts” degree or an “AS” – an “Associate of Science” degre e. These are usually for specific kinds of jobs or things that don’t require  a four-year university degree, a bachelor’s degree.

Sometimes people will study at community colleges to do all of their general education requirements before transferring or movin g from the community college to a four-year college or university where they get their bachelor’s degree. This is very common in California because t he tuition at community colleges is cheaper than the tuition at four-year u niversities, or universities that give bachelor’s degrees.

It’s quite common here in Los Angeles, for example,  for international students to come over and study at a community college such as Santa Monica College, which is close to where I live, and then after two years, after taking their general classes and improving their English, they transfer to either USC (University of Southern California) or UCLA (the University of Cal ifornia, Los Angeles) or another university here in California.

When I say they take “general education classes,” I  mean that they take classes that most universities require they take – English classes, math classes, usually some sort of science and history classes – classes that are usually required by most universities in order to graduate with a four- year degree.

Marcella says, “But who has the time? I have to wor k full-time to pay my bills.” Chris says, “Then think about a program that has a service commitment.” A “service commitment” is an agreement or a contract where you agree to work at a certain kind of job when you finish your educatio n, and by agreeing to do that, the government or an organization will give you mon ey.

This is common, for example, for teachers, because there are many schools, especially in cities like Los Angeles, that need te achers. The government may give you money to become a teacher, but you have to  agree to work for one of the schools for a certain number of years. If you d on’t, then you have to pay the money back to the government as a loan.

I got my teaching license back in Minnesota many ye ars ago on one of these service commitment grants. Although I didn’t actual ly work long enough in the schools to meet the agreement, so I had to pay some  of it back as a loan. But that’s not the point of the story. The point of the  story is that you can sometimes get money by signing one of these service agreement s for certain kinds of jobs.

There aren’t very many jobs that the government wil l do this for you. Sometimes it does it for doctors. They will pay the loans of doctors who agree to work in certain parts of the country that need doctors. Mar cella says, “What do you mean?” And then Chris explains. “There are teaching , military, or community service programs that will forgive or pay off your loans if you work for the organization for a few years after graduating.” Chr is mentions the military. The U.S. military will also give you money to go to col lege if you agree, of course, to go into the military for a certain number of years after.

The verb “to forgive a loan” refers to not requirin g you to pay the loan back. So, if the government gives you a loan and forgives the lo an, the government is saying you don’t have to give us the money that we gave yo u for the loan. “To pay off a loan” is to actually pay usually a bank that has lo aned you the money, the money that you owe. But Marcella doesn’t like this idea, either. She says, “And be an indentured servant? No, thank you!” An “indentured servant” was a person who signs an agreement to work for another person witho ut getting paid for a certain amount of time.

We don’t have indentured servants anymore. It’s not  legal in the United States to have an indentured servant. It was something that w as more popular in the nineteenth century and before. Wealthy families, for example, would pay immigrants to come and work on their farms or at th eir houses, and these workers would have to work for those people for a c ertain amount of time in order to, in effect, pay off the loan that the rich famil y gave the immigrants in order to come to the United States.

Chris says, “Okay, but most jobs nowadays require a  college degree.” A “degree” is a document saying that you have completed certai n requirements at the university. Marcella says, “Not if you really have talent.” She’s saying that not all jobs require a college degree if you have talent. C hris says, “Talent?” Marcella says, “Yeah, haven’t you seen me mime?” “To mime” ( mime) is to use your body and your face and your hands to show some action wi thout actually saying anything. Marcella thinks she has a talent for mimi ng.

She says, “That’s my ticket to a great career.” You r “ticket” here refers to your path to success, the way that you’re going to make a lot of money. Chris says,

 “I’m happy to hear you have such a practical plan m apped out for your future.” “To map out” something is to plan it, to know what all the details are of the plan that you are going to carry out. We use this expres sion not just in talking about using physical map to find out how to get from one place in the city to another, but more generally to refer to someone making detai led plans about his or her future.

Chris, of course, is being a little sarcastic here.  He’s making a joke. He doesn’t think that trying to become a professional mime is a very good plan for Marcella.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chris: Which colleges are you applying to?

Marcella: None. I can’t afford to go to college. Ev en if I lived at home, tuition, fees, and books are just too expensive.

Chris: You could apply for financial aid.

# Store Promotions and Giveaways

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,128 – Store Promotions and Giveaways.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,128. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast – and if you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains a complete transcript of everything we say.

This episode is a dialogue between Sonia and Paul a bout store promotions – things that stores give away in order to get custom ers. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: What is all this?

Paul: These are entry forms and materials for our n ew store promotions and giveaways.

Sonia: What prizes can people win?

Paul: There are different kinds, because we’re runn ing several promotions at once. We have scratch-off cards to win instant priz es, including t-shirts.

Sonia: Those t-shirts are really nice. I’d like one  of those.

Paul: We also have a collect-and-win game. People c ollect codes printed on our products. When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spend in our store.

Sonia: Wow, that’s great. I’d like a gift certifica te.

Paul: We also have a sweepstake. Enter to win one of three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car!

Sonia: Wow, I definitely want one of those.

Paul: Do you know what you can do to win?

 Sonia: No, what?

Paul: Quit your job. The rules say that employees a nd their families are not eligible.

Sonia: I don’t suppose I can find a way around that .

Paul: Not unless you’re considering divorcing your husband or disowning your children.

[end of dialogue]

Sonia begins our dialogue by asking Paul, “What is all this?” Notice, she says “all this” instead of just “this.” We would use that wor d “all” when someone has a lot of things and you are referring to a group of items , a group of things. Paul answers, “These are entry forms and the materials f or our new store promotions and giveaways.” Paul has more than one thing. He ha s several items.

He has “entry forms.” An “entry (entry) form” is a piece of paper, usually, that you put your name and address on in order to participat e in some sort of contest or competition. Stores sometimes will have a contest in which they will “give away” – that is, they will give as a gift for free – something for people  who give the store their names and addresses. We have a very similar concept on the Internet. Companies will give you something for free in exchange for your em ail address.

Well, Paul is getting some entry forms and material s for their new store promotions and giveaways. A “giveaway” is when you give something to people for free, usually something that isn’t very expensi ve. It doesn’t cost a lot of money. A “promotion” is when you lower the price of  something you are selling in order to get more people to buy it. It’s basically a sale where you cut or lower the price of something so more people will buy it.

Sonia says, “What prizes can people win?” A “prize”  (prize) is something that you win, usually in some contest or competition. Many s tates in the United States, including California, have what’s called a “lottery .” You buy a ticket, a piece of paper, for a dollar or two dollars, and you have a chance to win millions of dollars. The money that you win would be called the  “prize money.”

Sonia wants to know what prizes people can win. Pau l says, “There are different kinds,” meaning there are different kinds of prizes , “because we’re running

several promotions at once.” Notice he uses the ver b “to run” – “We’re running many,” or several, “promotions at once,” at the sam e time. You could say, “We are having different promotions,” but the verb “to run” is more often the case the one that we would use with this noun “promotions.”

Paul then explains the games, the contests they’re going to have. He says, “We have scratch-off cards to win instant prizes, inclu ding t-shirts.” A “scratch (scratch) – off (off) card” is a piece of paper tha t has numbers on it usually, but the numbers are covered, and in order to find out w hat the numbers are, you have to use your finger or a small coin to rub off – or “scratch off” – the material that is covering the number. This is how you find o ut if you have won a prize – if you have the right numbers.

“Instant” means immediately, right away. “Scratch-o ff cards” (they’re also called “scratchers”) are used for contests in which you wi n money or you win a prize immediately. You get your prize right after you scr atch off what’s covering up the numbers to see if you win. Sonia says, “Those t-shi rts are really nice. I’d like one of those.” Paul says, “We also have a collect-and-w in game.” A “collect-and-win game” is one in which you go around getting codes o r numbers from different packages, and once you have a certain number of the m, you can submit them or turn them in for a prize.

The most common collect-and-win promotion that I re member, growing up anyway, was bottle caps. Coca-Cola and other sodas often came in glass bottles, and on the top of the bottle would be a covering – what we would call a “cap” (cap). Sometimes stores would have a promotion in w hich if you brought in, say, 25 or 50 of these caps, you would get a prize. That ’s an example of a “collect- and-win.” You go out and collect something, and the n you win a prize for turning in all of those things to the company, to the store .

This of course encourages you to go out and buy mor e things that would have these numbers. That’s how the company sells more of  these things. Paul continues, “People collect codes printed on our pro ducts.” A “code” (code) is a series of letters and/or numbers that are used for some specific purpose. In this case, the company puts these codes on things that it sells, and you can collect them in order to get a prize.

I just thought of another collect-and-win promotion  that uses codes: Starbucks, the coffee company, sells coffee in the stores. You  can buy their coffee to make Starbucks coffee at home. When you buy a package of  their coffee, often it has a little sticker on it, a little piece of paper, the back of which has a code on it. And if

you enter that code into the website, Starbucks wil l give you a free coffee if you enter enough of the codes into their website. I do this all the time, actually.

Paul continues, “When they,” meaning the customers – “When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spe nd in our store.” A “gift certificate” is a piece of paper that a company giv es you that is worth a certain amount of money. Nowadays you don’t really see gift  certificates so often – usually what you get is what’s called a “gift card. ” The card has an electronic code on it, sort of like a credit card, that you ca n then use at a store just as if you were using money. There is “money on the card,” we might say.

Sonia says, “Wow that’s great. I’d like a gift cert ificate.” Paul continues, “We also have a sweepstake.” A “sweepstake” – more often use d in the plural, “sweepstakes” – is a promotion in which people fill  out a form and give it to the company and then the company picks a winner. It’s b asically what we would call a “lottery” (lottery). Paul says, “Enter to win one  of three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car!” Paul is sa ying that the prizes for the sweepstake are a television, a vacation in Hawaii, and a new car.

Sonia says, “Wow, I definitely want one of those.” Paul says, “Do you know what you can do to win?” Sonia says, “No, what?” Paul sa ys jokingly, “Quit your job. The rules say that employees and their families are  not eligible.” The “rules,” or the regulations, say that “employees” – people who work for the company – “and their families are not eligible.” “To be eligible” (eligible) means that you have the qualifications to do something. You are allowed to participate in something.

Well, Paul is saying that employees and their famil ies are not eligible. In other words, if you work for the company, you can’t enter  these games and win prizes. Sonia says, “I don’t suppose I can find a way aroun d that.” The expression “to find a way around” something means to figure out a way of not having to do something, of not having to follow the rules. We so metimes say, “There’s no way around it,” meaning there’s no way to avoid it. For  example, paying taxes in the United States if you work at a job – there’s no way  around it. The government won’t allow you to do it.

Sonia says, “I don’t suppose,” meaning I don’t thin k, “I can find a way around that.” Paul says, “Not unless you’re considering di vorcing your husband or disowning your children.” We now understand that Pa ul and Sonia are married. That’s why Paul again says jokingly that the only w ay Sonia would be eligible would to no longer be his wife, to divorce him. “To  divorce” (divorce) in this case means to end a marriage. In order for Sonia not to be a member of Paul’s family, she would have to divorce him.

 She might also have to disown her children.” “To di sown” (disown) means to no longer have a relationship with someone, especially  your children. If a father disowns his children, he’s saying to his children, “I don’t want anything to do with you anymore.” This is a verb we often use when some one dies – a parent dies and doesn’t leave his or her children any money. If  you disown your children, when you die, your “will,” your legal document that  says what happens to your things when you die, says that your children won’t get any money.

Fortunately, my parents never disowned me, but sinc e there are ten other siblings in my family – I have ten brothers and sis ters – I probably won’t get very much money anyway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: What is all this?

Paul: These are entry forms and materials for our n ew store promotions and giveaways.

Sonia: What prizes can people win?

Paul: There are different kinds, because we’re runn ing several promotions at once. We have scratch-off cards to win instant priz es, including t-shirts.

Sonia: Those t-shirts are really nice. I’d like one  of those.

Paul: We also have a collect-and-win game. People c ollect codes printed on our products. When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spend in our store.

Sonia: Wow, that’s great. I’d like a gift certifica te.

Paul: We also have a sweepstake. Enter to win one of three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car!

Sonia: Wow, I definitely want one of those.

Paul: Do you know what you can do to win?

 Sonia: No, what?

Paul: Quit your job. The rules say that employees a nd their families are not eligible.

Sonia: I don’t suppose I can find a way around that .

Paul: Not unless you’re considering divorcing your husband or disowning your children.

# Experiencing Virtual Reality

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,129 – Experiencing Virtual Reality.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,129. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This is an episode about experiencing virtual reali ty. What is virtual reality? We’ll find out in this episode. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tatiana: Why are you wearing those funny goggles?

Moustafa: I’m trying out a new kind of virtual real ity.

Tatiana: You mean like flight simulators?

Moustafa: This is much more sophisticated. This sys tem creates a complete sensory experience. I can see, hear, feel, and near ly taste this 3-D simulation.

Tatiana: I don’t see how it can do that.

Moustafa: With the help of these goggles and headph ones, this computer program re-creates what it’s like to actually be in  a particular place, at a particular time. It even allows me to interact with different people and things.

Tatiana: I can see how that would be useful for gam ing, but . . .

Moustafa: It’s not only for gaming. It’s useful for  a host of other things, including relaxation. For instance, right now I’m experiencin g what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.

Tatiana: If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.

 Moustafa: Yes, but with virtual reality, I may neve r have to get out of this chair again. Now isn’t that progress?

[end of dialogue]

Tatiana asks Moustafa, “Why are you wearing those f unny goggles?” The word “funny” here means odd, strange, or unusual. We als o use the word “funny” when something makes us laugh, but here it’s used to mea n weird or strange. “Goggles” (goggles) are things that you wear over y our eyes like eyeglasses to protect them. The difference between regular eyegla sses and goggles is that goggles have protection on the side so that your ey es are completely protected or surrounded by the glass (or usually it’s plastic  that goggles are made out of). Sometimes there’s a combination of rubber and plast ic for goggles.

Moustafa says, “I’m trying out a new kind of virtua l reality.” “To try out” is a two- word phrasal verb that here means to test something , to do something for the first time, especially when you are trying to deter mine whether you like it or not and or whether you want to buy it or not. “To try o ut” can also mean to try to become a member of a team. That use of the phrasal verb is more common in schools. You can “try out” for the basketball team – you can try to become a member of the basketball team. But here, “to try ou t” means to test something.

“Virtual reality” is a computer-made or computer-ge nerated experience. Usually it involves you wearing a special device that looks li ke goggles that you put on your head, and it seems as though you are in a different  place or experiencing something that is not real. That’s the meaning of t he word “virtual” (virtual) in this phrase or term. Tatiana says, “You mean like flight  simulators?” A “flight (flight) simulator (simulator)” is a machine that is used to  teach people how to fly an airplane. You’re not actually in the airplane, but you’re in a special machine that makes it seem as if you were in an airplane.

Flight simulators, I guess, are a kind of virtual r eality, but the virtual reality that people talk about nowadays usually involves somethi ng more sophisticated, and often with just something over your eyes, or perhap s something in your ears and over your eyes. Moustafa says, “This is much more s ophisticated.” The word “sophisticated” (sophisticated) means here advanced  – more complex with more technology. He says, “This system creates a complet e sensory experience.”

The word “sensory” (sensory) relates to the five se nses: taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. Those are called the “five senses” (sens es). Then of course there is the “sixth sense,” which is talking to dead people.  (You have to see the movie to

understand what I mean by that.) Moustafa continues , “I can see, hear, feel, and nearly taste this 3-D simulation.” Well, I doubt he  can feel anything although it’s possible.

A “3-D simulation” is “three-dimensional” – “three- dimensional” refers to height, length, and width. Of course, it only seems as if it were 3-D. The real world is 3- D. But when you watch a movie – even a movie with v irtual reality goggles – it isn’t actually in three dimensions. It just seems a s if it were. A “simulation” is a situation where you’re making something seem as if it were real even though it isn’t. Tatiana is confused. She says, “I don’t see how it can do that.”

Moustafa replies, “With the help of these goggles a nd headphones, this computer program re-creates what it’s like to actually be in  a particular place, at a particular time.” “Headphones” are things you put over your ea rs in order to hear music or some other sound that has been recorded. The verb “ to recreate” (recreate) means to copy how something happened or how somethi ng was done to give someone a similar experience.

What Moustafa is saying here is that there is a com puter program that allows you to re-create what it’s like to be in a particular p lace and a particular time. Once again, it’s really like watching a movie that makes  it seem as though you are there in the action – and that’s what a 3-D movie t ries to do. Moustafa continues, “It even allows me to interact with different peopl e and things.” “To interact” means to talk to or to communicate with another per son.

Tatiana says, “I can see how that would be useful f or gaming, but . . .” “Gaming” (gaming) means playing video games, something that is very popular nowadays among many people, but not me. I grew up in the lat e ’70s, early ’80s, and video games were just getting started at that time and I never really got that interested in them, but I know they are very popular among mil lions of people, just not me. Well, Tatiana thinks this virtual reality machine w ould be useful for gaming, but she doesn’t seem to think it would be useful for an ything else.

Moustafa disagrees, “It’s not only for gaming,” he says. “It’s useful for a host of other things, including relaxation.” A “host (host)  of” something is a large number of something. Moustafa is saying that virtual-reali ty goggles can be used for many different things, including “relaxation” – the  act of becoming calm. “For instance,” Moustafa says, “right now,” meaning at t his time, “I’m experiencing what it’s like to be outdoors with the sun shining and the birds chirping.”

“To be outdoors” (outdoors) means to be outside, no t in a house or a building. The sun “shines” (shines) from the sky. “To shine” means for a light to be

produced. The sound that birds make is sometimes de scribed using the verb “to chirp” (chirp). We talk about birds “chirping.” In fact there’s a bird chirping outside of my window right now. So, Moustafa is saying that  he can experience things such as being outside in the sunshine with the bird s chirping. Tatiana says, “If you open the door, you’ll see that the sun is shini ng and the birds are chirping” – meaning in the real world.

Moustafa says, “Yes, but with virtual reality I may  never have to get out of this chair again.” He’s saying that he will never have t o get out of his chair to stand up and leave his house. He says, “Now, isn’t that prog ress?” “Progress” (progress) is an improvement over time, often used when we’re talking about technology, although I’m not sure if everything that technology  has brought us has resulted in progress.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tatiana: Why are you wearing those funny goggles?

Moustafa: I’m trying out a new kind of virtual real ity.

Tatiana: You mean like flight simulators?

Moustafa: This is much more sophisticated. This sys tem creates a complete sensory experience. I can see, hear, feel, and near ly taste this 3-D simulation.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,130 – Eating Breakfast Foods.

This episode is a dialogue between Emil and Tammy a bout things you might eat for breakfast. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emil: Look at this breakfast buffet. Wow, I’ve died  and gone to heaven!

Tammy: I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fruit, a nd a bagel.

Emil: What?! How can you pass up this amazing buffe t? I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.

Tammy: I don’t normally eat a big breakfast. If I’m  still hungry after this, I’ll have some pancakes.

Emil: Pancakes! I’m going to have some pancakes whe n I’m done with this first round, plus some waffles and French toast.

Tammy: Well, more power to you. I can’t imagine any one eating more than what’s already on your plate.

Emil: I’ve only just begun. After the pancakes, waf fles, and French toast, I think I’ll have an omelet and some biscuits and gravy. I might even have room for one or two of those doughnuts.

Tammy: You’re not serious.

Emil: I’m dead serious.

Tammy: You sound like you’re planning on staying he re all morning.

Emil: That’s right. Do you want to meet me back her e for the lunch buffet?

[end of dialogue]

Emil says to Tammy at the beginning of our dialogue , “Look at this breakfast buffet.” “Breakfast,” you probably know, is a meal that you eat in the morning. It’s the first meal of the day. If you look up the word,  you can see why we use it. The word “fast” (fast) means quick, but it can also mea n not to eat food. So “break/fast” would be to break – or end – your fast . And of course, when you’re sleeping, you’re not eating, so when you wake up, y ou have in a sense been fasting.

A “buffet” (buffet) is a meal in a restaurant where  you can take as much food as you want. Usually the restaurant will have a number  of different dishes, a number of different kinds of food, and you can take your p late and put as much food as you want onto your plate to eat. These sometimes are called “all-you-can-eat” buffets, because typically you can eat as much as y ou want.

Emil is telling Tammy to look at the breakfast buff et where they are. He says, “Wow, I’ve died and gone to heaven!” That expressio n, “I’ve died (died) and gone to heaven,” means that you are very happy, as if yo u were to die and then go up to heaven and be happy forever and ever. So, when s omeone says, “I’ve died and gone to heaven,” he means “I’m extremely happy.  This is the best possible situation.” Usually we say this when we are given o r have the opportunity to do something – or in this case, eat something that you  really love.

Tammy says, “I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fr uit, and a bagel.” “Cereal” (cereal) is very popular as an American breakfast. There are lots of different varieties of cereal. Usually cereal comes in small little pieces that you put into a bowl and put milk into, and then you eat the cereal  with a spoon. It’s a very common breakfast because it’s easy to make. You don ’t have to cook anything.

Tammy says she’s going to “grab,” or take, “some ce real, fruit, and a bagel.” A “bagel” (bagel) is a round piece of chewy bread. It  sort of looks like a doughnut because there’s a hole in the middle. However, it i s hard – that is, it’s not soft like a doughnut. It’s what we would call “chewy” (chewy)  bread because you have to move your mouth up and down several times in order to chew it. Bagels are usually served with something on top of them. You p ut on something like cream cheese.

Emil says, “What? How can you pass up this amazing buffet?” Emil is surprised that Tammy just wants to have a little bit of food,  because of course when you have a buffet, you can eat as much as you want. So,  Emil doesn’t understand why Tammy would just want cereal, fruit, and a bage l. He says, “How can you pass up this amazing buffet?” The phrasal verb “to pass up” means to decide not to do something, not to have something.

Emil says, “I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled  eggs, and hash browns.” “Bacon” is meat from a pig, that is very fatty. It has a lot of fat in it. It’s cut into very thin strips, or slices, that usually you cook in a pan. It’s really good. I love bacon myself. “Scrambled eggs” is a way of preparin g eggs. You take two eggs that are raw, that are not cooked, and you blend th em together. You could also take three eggs or however many eggs you want. You blend the eggs together, and then you put them in a frying pan to cook them.  That’s called “scrambled (scrambled) eggs.”

“Hash (hash) browns” are basically potatoes that yo u chop up and cook in a frying pan. Hash browns are usually served at break fast along with eggs and bacon. It’s basically a potato dish that you eat for breakfast. Tammy says, “I don’t normally eat a big breakfast. If I’m still hungry a fter this,” meaning after she eats her cereal, fruit, and bagel, “I’ll have some panca kes.” “Pancakes” (pancakes) are flat cakes made of flour that are cooked in a h ot frying pan.

Emil says, “Pancakes! I’m going to have some pancak es when I’m done with this first round, plus some waffles and French toast.” T he word “round” (round) here refers to one of many different events, or differen t parts of an event. In the sport of boxing, where two people get up and basically hi t each other, we have “rounds” – those are parts of the competition. Usua lly there are a number of different rounds, each of which are a couple of min utes long.

Emil is referring to the number of times he’s going  to go up to the buffet and get more food. He calls these “rounds.” He’s going to h ave waffles and French toast. A “waffle” (waffle) is a square piece of basically sweet bread that usually is served with butter and a liquid kind of sugar calle d “syrup.” It’s also very popular for breakfast in the United States.

“French toast” is a breakfast item made by taking a  piece of toast and putting the toast into a mixture of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and s ometimes vanilla. You take a piece of bread and you put it into this mixture and  then you heat up the bread on both sides in a hot pan. That’s called “French toas t,” although I don’t know if it’s French or not. Tammy says, “Well, more power to you .” “More power to” someone is a phrase we use to express our good wish es and perhaps admiration

toward another person. You’re basically saying, “We ll, good for you. That’s just great.”

Tammy says, “I can’t imagine anyone eating more tha n what’s already on your plate.” Tammy is surprised that Emil is going to wa nt even more food than what he already has. Emil says, however, “I’ve only just  begun,” meaning I’m just getting started eating breakfast. “After the pancak es, waffles, and French toast, I think I’ll have an omelet and some biscuits and gra vy. I might even have room for one or two of those doughnuts.”

An “omelet” (omelet) is a breakfast food made from eggs that are mixed usually with some other ingredient. It could be vegetables;  it could be meat; it could be cheese, or some combination of those three. You mix  the eggs together, usually with milk, and you put that mixture into a hot pan and the eggs begin to cook. Then you put the other ingredients, the other thing s you want in your omelet, on top and you fold the omelet over so it looks like a  half-circle or semicircle.

“Biscuits” (biscuits) are round rolls, a kind of br ead. “Gravy” (gravy) is a thick, usually meat-based sauce – a thick liquid that is m ade from some kind of meat. In some places, especially in the southern United S tates, having “biscuits and gravy” is popular for breakfast.

Finally, Emil says he may also have some doughnuts.  A “doughnut” (doughnut) is a round piece of sweet bread that has a hole in the  middle. But unlike a bagel, which looks like a doughnut, it is fried and covere d usually in some sort of sugar coating or frosting. Doughnuts are also very popula r with some people for breakfast. American cities have lots of what are ca lled “doughnut shops” – places where you can go and buy all different kinds of dou ghnuts. I’m really getting hungry right now talking about all this food.

Tammy says to Emil, “You’re not serious.” She doesn ’t really believe that Emil is going to eat all this food. Emil says, however, “I’ m dead serious.” When someone says he is “dead (dead) serious,” he means he’s ver y serious. He’s not joking. Usually we use this expression when someone doesn’t  believe we are being serious. If you say to your co-worker, “You’re not really going to leave the office right now and go to the beach, are you?” Your co-wo rker might say, “I’m dead serious,” meaning “Yes, I’m not joking. That’s real ly what I’m going to do.”

Tammy says, “You sound like you’re planning on stay ing here all morning,” meaning you’re going to stay at the restaurant all morning and eat. Emil says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “Do you wan t to meet me back here for the lunch buffet?” Emil suggests that Tammy come back l ater in the afternoon so that

she can join him for another buffet, for lunch. Buf fets are very popular for lunch as well as for breakfast – perhaps even more popula r for lunch.

There are, here in Los Angeles, restaurants that se rve Indian food. There are lots of Indian buffets. There are lots of Chinese buffet s, where you can go and get all sorts of Chinese food and eat as much as you want. These are “all-you-can-eat” buffets. Maybe this is one reason why Americans, on  average, are so overweight. They go to all of these all-you-can-eat  buffets all the time.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Emil: Look at this breakfast buffet. Wow, I’ve died  and gone to heaven!

Tammy: I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fruit, a nd a bagel.

Emil: What?! How can you pass up this amazing buffe t? I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.

# Visiting an Archaeological Site

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,131 – Visiting an Archaeological Site.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,131. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and download the Learning Guide for this episode. What’s in the Learning Guide? It has a complete transcript of  everything I say and a whole lot more.

This episode is a dialogue between Lillian and Bruc e about going to an archaeological site – a place where we find out wha t people were like many, many years ago before we had Wikipedia. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Lillian: Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.

Bruce: You can’t do that. That might be an artifact  of some kind. It belongs to this archaeological site.

Lillian: It’s just a rock. No one will miss it.

Bruce: That’s not the point. Everything here should  be preserved. That’s the point of doing a careful excavation. Everything should be  recorded and nothing should be lost.

Lillian: Take it easy. It’s not like I’m defacing a nything. And if they’re trying to preserve this site, why are they doing this dig? Wo uldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?

Bruce: The point is to learn more about the peoples  of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.

Lillian: In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to distu rb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.

Bruce: Some people would agree with you, but that’s  the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human history. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could be a fossil.

Lillian: Do you really think so?

Bruce: You never know. You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire civilization.

Lillian: Wow, if I take it, I could preserve it for  posterity.

Bruce: What happened to leaving things undisturbed?

Lillian: That’s before I realized I could go down i n history for my own discovery!

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is all about visiting, or going to, a n archaeological site. “Archaeological” (archaeological) is the study of h uman history by looking at what people many years ago left behind, things we usuall y find in the ground. To understand what life was like a thousand years ago or five thousand years ago, we dig into the ground. We make a hole or remove gr ound so we can see what is still there from these old civilizations.

The study of archaeology is the study of these old civilizations, the way people lived many years ago. Specifically, “archaeology” d eals with looking at what remains physically – what we can find, as I said be fore, usually buried in the ground. Lillian begins our dialogue by saying to Br uce, “Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.” A “souvenir” (souven ir) is something you bring home from a place that you have visited.

Now of course, when you go to an archaeological sit e, you can’t bring a souvenir home. That’s usually not allowed. And that’s what B ruce tells Lillian. “You can’t do that. That might be an artifact of some kind.” A n “artifact” (artifact) is a word that we use to describe anything that was made by h uman beings many years ago and then is found. So, archaeological sites, or  areas where we are digging into the ground, find things, physical things that we call “artifacts.” Bruce says, “It belongs to this archaeological site.” The word “sit e” (site) just means place or location – where something is done.

Lillian says, however, “It’s just a rock. No one wi ll miss it,” meaning no one will even know it’s gone. Bruce says, however, “That’s n ot the point.” “That’s not the

point” means you don’t understand or you’re giving a reason that is not relevant here. He says, “Everything here should be preserved .” “To preserve” (preserve) means to take care of something so that it is saved  for the future. You take care of the condition of the object. The verb is “to pre serve.” The noun is “preservation.”

Bruce says, “That’s the point of,” or that’s the re ason for, “doing a careful excavation.” An “excavation” (excavation) is also s ometimes called a “dig” (dig). An “excavation” is a place where you dig into the g round. You remove the dirt and the rocks in order to see what’s underneath the m. You will normally only hear or read this word “excavation” relating to arc haeological sites. Bruce says, “Everything should be recorded and nothing should b e lost.” “To record” something here means to write it down, or perhaps t o take a film of it.

Lillian says, “Take it easy,” meaning “Don’t get ex cited, Bruce.” “It’s not like I’m defacing anything,” she says. “To deface”(deface) s omething is to change the way something looks, usually by painting on it or p erhaps scratching it. If someone puts a sign up on a wall, for example, and you don’t like what the sign says, you could, say, take some paint and put a big  X on it. That would be “defacing” the sign. By the way, that’s usually ill egal – when you deface someone else’s property – so you should probably not do tha t.

Lillian continues, “And if they’re trying to preser ve this site, why are they doing this dig?” “Dig,” remember, means “excavation.” “Wo uldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?” The phrase “frozen (froze n) in time” means not changing anything, or perhaps a situation that has been the same for many, many years. If you don’t dig it up, Lillian says, it will remain t he same as it was before. Of course, the difficult part of archaeology is diggin g things up without ruining them.

Bruce says, “The point” – once again, the reason – “is to learn more about the peoples of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.” “Ancient” (ancient) means very old, usually thousands of years old. “Ci vilization” refers to a society or group of people who live together with similar c ustoms, similar laws, and similar practices. The point of archaeology is to l earn about the peoples of ancient civilizations who lived in what we call “pr ehistory.” “Prehistory” (prehistory) is the period of time before human bei ngs began to write, before they began to record things so that they could be read l ater on.

Lillian says, “In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to  disturb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.” “To disturb” (disturb) can mean to bother or to interrupt someone. Here, it me ans to change something in a negative way. The word “burial” (burial) refers to putting a dead body into the

ground. A “mound” (mound) is basically a pile of di rt, an area that is higher than the ground or earth around it.

A “burial mound” is a place where someone is buried . Instead of digging in the ground and putting the body in the ground, in a hol e, you put dirt or earth over the body. Burial mounds were very common in many di fferent civilizations, including the Native American civilizations in the area where I grew up in Minnesota, where you can still see burial mounds fr om the ancient American- Indian civilizations.

“Tombs” (tombs) are also places where you put a dea d body, except usually it’s an area or a room instead of underground in a hole or in a burial mound. You can think of the ancient tombs in Egypt. These are plac es where you bury someone above the ground in a room or in a large area. Lill ian is saying that they should not be digging into these burial mounds and tombs.

She says, “They were never meant to be desecrated l ike this.” “To desecrate” (desecrate) means to treat something with disrespec t, especially something that you consider holy – something that has religious va lue or religious significance. Bruce continues, “Some people would agree with you,  but that’s the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human his tory. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could  be a fossil.” A “fossil” (fossil) is a rock that contains the image of an animal or a pl ant that died many years ago.

Lillian says, “Do you really think so?” meaning do you really think this could be a fossil? Bruce says, “You never know” – you can neve r be sure. “You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire c ivilization.” Bruce means you could be holding in your hand right now a very impo rtant piece of information that would help us understand this civilization. Lillian  says, “Wow. If I take it, I could preserve it for posterity.” “Posterity” (posterity)  refers to future generations – people who have not even been born yet.

Lillian is still thinking of taking this rock with her. Bruce asks her, “What happened to leaving things undisturbed?” meaning “W hy did you change your mind about leaving things undisturbed, because now you’re talking about taking this rock with you.” Lillian says, “That’s before I  realized I could go down in history for my own discovery!”

The expression “to go down in history” means to be remembered for a particular accomplishment or to be remembered in a certain way . It could be a good way. It could be a bad way. Adolf Hitler will go down in hi story as being a very evil man a man who was responsible for killing millions of peo ple. Gandhi in India will be

remembered, or go down in history, for helping esta blish the independence of his country. I will go down in history as being one of the great singing podcasters of the twenty-first century. Hey, don’t laugh.

Lillian wants to go down in history for her own dis covery. “Discovery” comes from the verb “to discover” (discover), which means to l earn something about something else for the first time, before anyone el se has learned it. You could discover a cure for a disease – you could find the answer to help people get over their sickness. That would be a discovery.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lillian: Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.

Bruce: You can’t do that. That might be an artifact  of some kind. It belongs to this archaeological site.

Lillian: It’s just a rock. No one will miss it.

Bruce: That’s not the point. Everything here should  be preserved. That’s the point of doing a careful excavation. Everything should be  recorded and nothing should be lost.

Lillian: Take it easy. It’s not like I’m defacing a nything. And if they’re trying to preserve this site, why are they doing this dig? Wo uldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?

Bruce: The point is to learn more about the peoples  of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.

Lillian: In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to distu rb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.

Bruce: Some people would agree with you, but that’s  the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human history. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could be a fossil.

Lillian: Do you really think so?

 Bruce: You never know. You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire civilization.

Lillian: Wow, if I take it, I could preserve it for  posterity.

Bruce: What happened to leaving things undisturbed?

Lillian: That’s before I realized I could go down i n history for my own discovery!

# Defending Your Ideas at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,132 – Defending Your Ideas at Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,132. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this epis ode. Are you on Facebook? So are we. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

In this episode, we’re going to talk about defendin g your ideas, or giving reasons for your ideas, when you’re at work. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Monica: That’s why I don’t think it’s doable. We sh ould consider other ideas. . . .

That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis.  She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is to  not get defensive. . . .

Kazuya: I appreciate your feedback. I understand your reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I beli eve will address your concerns. . . .

I knew Monica would attack my ideas, so I had come prepared. . . .

Monica: That’s all very impressive, but I still thi nk we need to consider other options. . . .

Unfortunately, when Monica digs in her heels, I kno w that the only thing to do is to placate her. That plus a delaying tactic usually  works. . . .

Kazuya: Your comments have given me a lot to think about. We’re running short on time and we want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it next week. . . .

Luckily, I know something else about Monica: She ha s a short attention span. By next week, she’ll be on to her next victim!

[end of dialogue]

We hear in this episode the voices of two different  people at work. In addition, we hear comments from one of those people – Kazuya. the story begins with Monica saying, “That’s why I don’t think it’s doabl e. We should consider other ideas.” Now, Monica is talking to Kazuya, and Kazuy a is going to talk to us, if you will, directly about the way that Monica is talking  to him.

Monica says that something that she and Kazuya are talking about is not doable. “Doable” (doable) comes from combining two words – “able” and “do.” Something that is “doable” is something that you can or are a ble to do. Another word we might use here is “feasible” (feasible). Something that is doable is something that can be done, something that is not too difficult.

Monica is telling Kazuya that whatever idea he has is not doable. Then we hear Kazuya giving his commentary, his view of what Moni ca is saying. He says, “That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis.” A “ nemesis” (nemesis) is an enemy. It’s someone whom you can’t beat or win agai nst, someone who creates problems for you. Kazuya is probably using this wor d somewhat jokingly. Normally we don’t describe people at work as our en emies, but that’s how Kazuya is describing Monica.

He says, “She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is not to get defensive.” “To criticize” someone is to  say that his idea has problems, or the things that he is doing are wrong or perhaps  simply not good enough, not of a high enough quality. Kazuya says that Monica a lways criticizes his ideas. She says his ideas aren’t good enough.

Kazuya says that he’s learned that “the best defens e is not to get defensive.” “Defense” (defense) are things you do to protect yo urself or to stop someone who is competing against you from winning. If you t hink of, say, a football game – an American football game – one side has the ball. They’re the offense. The other side is trying to stop them from moving down the field. They’re the defense.

Most sports that have teams have offense and defens e, or at least the teams are playing offense or defense during different parts of the game.

Kazuya says, “The best defense is not to get defens ive.” “To get defensive” (defensive) is to be worried about someone else cri ticizing you and to try to explain why something isn’t your fault. Someone who  is defensive often thinks that other people are criticizing him, and so he sa ys things to make sure that people don’t think something is his fault.

Kazuya says to Monica, “I appreciate your feedback. ” “Feedback” (feedback) is information that someone or something gives you to tell you how well you are doing something or whether other people like it. If  you write an essay at school, or a long paper, and you give it to the professor, the professor may give you feedback on your paper. Notice we use the prepositi on “on” – you get feedback “on” something. The professor may say, “Oh, that wa s a great paper,” or he might say, “That was a terrible paper.” That’s usua lly what happened to me.

Kazuya continues, “I understand your reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I believe will addres s your concerns.” The word “reservation” is used when you have an appointment at a certain restaurant or when you are going to stay in a certain hotel, but we also use the word “reservation” to mean “hesitation” – reasons for no t wanting to do something. If someone says, “I have reservations about going on t his trip,” she means, “I have doubts about it” – there are reasons why I don’t th ink it’s a good idea.

Kazuya says he understands Monica’s reservations. “ But,” he says, “let me show you these figures I’ve worked up.” The word “figure s” (figures) here means numbers, calculations. You added or subtracted or m ultiplied something and it gives you some information that’s important. “To wo rk up” something or “to work something up” is a phrasal verb meaning to create o r develop something. It could also mean to calculate some figures, as is the case  in our story here. “To work something up” usually means to present what we call  a “first draft” (draft) of something.

If you are working on the design of a website, you may work up some examples to show your client, your customer, so that that pe rson can look at it and give you feedback on it. You see? It all works together. Kaz uya says that the figures that he’s worked up will address Monica’s concerns. “To address (address) someone’s concerns” means to discuss or handle some thing, to take care of the particular problem. So, in this case, Kazuya will s how Monica something that Monica can look at and see that Kazuya’s idea is a good one.

Kazuya then says to us, not to Monica, “I knew Moni ca would attack my ideas, so I had come prepared.” Monica says, “That’s all very  impressive, but I still think we need to consider other options.” Monica is saying t hat what Kazuya did is very interesting, even something that is very good, but she still thinks that the company or the group needs to think about other pos sibilities other than what Kazuya said. That’s why Kazuya says to us, “Unfortu nately, when Monica digs in her heels, I know the only thing to do is to placat e her.”

The expression “to dig in your heels” (heels) means  to become very stubborn, to refuse to change your opinion or decision even thou gh other people want you to. The “heel” is the bottom back part of a shoe, and “ to dig” means to create a little hole in the ground. You can imagine someone who dig s in his heels outside – say, in the ground. He would be trying to prevent s omeone from moving him from his position. That’s where we get this expression “ to dig in your heels.” Once again, it means to become very stubborn and refuse to change your opinion or decision. That’s how Kazuya describes Monica.

He says when this happens, when she digs in her hee ls, “the only thing to do is to placate her.” “To placate” (placate) means to ma ke another person feel less angry or less mad by addressing his needs or addres sing his concerns even though you think it really shouldn’t be necessary. If you come home late from work and you didn’t call your wife, you may need to  placate her because she will be very angry at you. You need to say things that w ill make her less angry at you, and if you don’t know what to say, well, you probab ly won’t be married for very long.

Kazuya says that placating Monica is a good idea. “ Plus,” he says, “a delaying tactic usually works.” “To delay” (delay) something  is to not do it when you planned on doing it – to do it at a later time, to postpone it. We might also say a “tactic” (tactic) is a strategy, an approach, the w ay you do something. So, a “delaying tactic” is something you do to make somet hing happen later than when you had planned on doing it or than when it should have been done. Kazuya is going to use a delaying tactic which we learn about  in the next sentence.

He says to Monica, “Your comments have given me a l ot to think about. We’re running short on time.” “To run short on time” mean s that you don’t have very much time left in a meeting, for example. He says, “We want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it nex t week.” Kazuya is suggesting that they stop talking about this topic right now –  Kazuya’s ideas – and go on to something else so they can talk about it again the following week. That’s a delaying tactic. He’s making things last longer tha n they would have otherwise because he thinks that will help in getting his ide as approved by Monica.

 Then Kazuya says at the end, “Luckily,” fortunately , “I know something about Monica. She has a short attention span.” Your “atte ntion span” (span) is how long you can concentrate on one topic, how long you can focus on something without thinking about anything else. If you have a short a ttention span, you can’t focus on something for very long. We could say you have a  long attention span, though usually the phrase you will hear most often is “sho rt attention span.”

Kazuya concludes, “By next week, she’ll be on to he r next victim.” A “victim” (victim) is a person who suffers from some problem or action. It’s a person who’s been hurt by something or someone. We can talk abou t “victims of crime” – people who have been hurt or injured in some way by  another person. Someone may have stolen something from him or even killed h im. We would call someone who has been killed a “murder victim.”

Well, we’re not talking about murder here – what Ka zuya is saying is that by waiting till next week to talk about his ideas with  Monica, Monica will have forgotten about this idea and will have gone “on to ,” or put her focus or attention on, someone else in the office she doesn’t like or doesn’t agree with. That’s what Kazuya means by “her next victim” – someone else in  the office that she can attack or criticize.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue (or the story) at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Monica: That’s why I don’t think it’s doable. We sh ould consider other ideas. . . .

That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis.  She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is to  not get defensive. . . .

Kazuya: I appreciate your feedback. I understand your reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I beli eve will address your concerns. . . .

 Monica: That’s all very impressive, but I still thi nk we need to consider other options. . . .

Kazuya: Your comments have given me a lot to think about. We’re running short on time and we want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it next week. . . .

Luckily, I know something else about Monica: She ha s a short attention span. By next week, she’ll be on to her next victim!

# Getting Immunizations Required by Schools

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,133 – Getting Immunizations Required by Schools.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,133. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our Special Cou rses in Business and Daily English. You can also like us on Facebook at facebo ok.com/eslpod. And why not follow us on Twitter – at @eslpod, of course.

This episode is something about immunizations. What  are immunizations? Well, you’ll have to listen and find out, won’t you? Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jonas: Hi, Jenny. Are you getting your kids ready f or school, too?

Jenny: Yes, as you can see, we’re buying lots of sc hool supplies.

Jonas: Did you get the school letter reminding pare nts to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school? I know  that your youngest is starting school this year.

Jenny: Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getting an exemption. I’m not sure vaccines are safe, and I don’t want to take a chanc e with her health.

Jonas: The immunizations required by the school are  standard – measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other  children have had.

Jenny: But when I looked at the list, there were a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting!

Jonas: The ones you mentioned are standard, too. Do n’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our kids h ad been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.

Jenny: I’ve read somewhere that vaccines might be d angerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their future.

Jonas: That’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.

Jenny: Why’s that?

Jonas: Because your children won’t be getting an ed ucation. The school is barring any children who don’t get immunized from a ttending school.

Jenny: I call that irresponsible!

Jonas: That’s exactly the word that came to my mind .

[end of dialogue]

Jonas begins by saying to Jenny, “Hi, Jenny. Are yo u getting your kids ready for school, too?” I suppose Jonas means here getting your kids prepared to go to school. Schools in the United States usually start their classes in the fall – in late August, early September. Jenny says, “Yes, as you can see, we’re buying a lot of school supplies.” “School supplies” would be things  like pencils, notebooks, erasers, pens – that sort of thing.

Jonas says, “Did you get the school letter remindin g parents to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school?” “Immu nization” (immunization) means giving the body the ability to protect itself  from a certain disease, either because it has already had that disease, or more li kely because it has received what’s called a “vaccine.” A “vaccine” (vaccine) is  a medicine that is put into your body that allows your body to fight a particular di sease. Usually the idea is that the vaccine will prevent you from getting that dise ase.

Another way to look at this is that the vaccine is the medicine that is put in your body to prevent you from getting certain diseases. “Immunization” is what happens to your body because of the vaccine. So it’ s what happens after you get the vaccine. Your body then has an immunity against  a certain disease. However, sometimes people use these two words inter changeably. They talk about getting immunizations. What they really mean is they’re getting vaccines so that their body will have an immunity, an abilit y to protect itself against a certain disease or diseases.

Okay, where were we? Jonah says, “Did you get the s chool letter reminding parents to submit” – to give to the school – “proof ” – or evidence – “of immunization before the first day of school?” Most schools in the United States require that the parents get their children vaccina ted – that is, given these

vaccines – against certain common diseases. Jonas s ays, “I know that your youngest is starting school this year.” He means Je nny’s youngest child.

Jenny says, “Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getti ng an exemption.” An “exemption” (exemption) is permission not to follow  a certain rule or law because of some sort of special circumstance. Jenny says, “ I’m not sure vaccines are safe and I don’t want to take a chance with her health.”  We’ve already explained what vaccines are. There are a small number of parents i n the U.S. in recent years who have been concerned that the vaccines themselve s are somehow not safe, that getting the vaccine might be worse than gettin g the disease.

Now, almost every doctor will tell you that this is n’t true, but some parents don’t listen to the doctors, and so what happens is they try to get their children into the schools without being vaccinated by getting an exem ption. Jonas says, “The immunizations required by the school are standard –  measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other children have had.” When we say something is “standard,” we mean in this case it’s normal. It ’s ordinary. It’s nothing unusual, nothing special.

Jonas then lists the diseases that are typically co vered by the vaccinations that schools require. He begins with “measles” (measles) . “Measles” is a disease that produces a small red spot on the skin. We would cal l it a “rash” (rash). It also tends to give the person who has it a “fever” (feve r). A fever is when your body’s temperature is higher than it should be.

Another disease that children are vaccinated agains t is “mumps” (mumps). Mumps is a disease that causes a, what we would cal l “swelling” – a sudden growth – in the neck area. “Chicken pox” (pox) is a  disease that, like measles, produces red spots on the skin. It’s very common am ong young children. I had chicken pox, I remember, when I was growing up as a  child.

Now, the reason that we give these vaccines to chil dren is most of these diseases are what are called “communicable,” which is to say that you can get them from other people. Of course, we don’t want the children giving other children these diseases. That’s why we have the vac cines. Another disease mentioned by Jonas is “polio” (polio) “Polio” can b e a very serious disease that causes paralysis – that is, the inability to move y our arms and legs and possibly other parts of your body.

Jenny isn’t so sure that she wants to have her daug hter getting these vaccines. She says, “But when I looked at the list, there wer e a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting?” Jenny

mentions three other diseases that children might b e vaccinated against. “Diphtheria” (diphtheria) is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to swallow. It often causes what we would call a “sore  (sore) throat.” If you have a sore throat, it’s difficult for you to swallow. “Di phtheria” often results in a fever as well.

“Hepatitis” (hepatitis) is a disease that can damag e your liver. Your liver is a very important organ or part of your body. The third dis ease Jenny mentions is “rubella” (rubella). “Rubella,” when I was growing up, was called “German measles.” It’s a disease that also produces a red r ash or spot or area on your skin and produces a fever, much like measles does.

Jonas says, “The ones you mentioned are standard, t oo. Don’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our ki ds had been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.” An “outbreak” (outbreak ) is a sudden increase in a disease, or at least in the number of people, I sho uld say, who have the disease. There could be an outbreak of the flu – of influenz a – where many different people are getting the disease.

Jonas mentions another disease, “whopping (whooping ) cough (cough).” “To cough” is to do this [coughs]. “Whooping cough” is a disease that produces very strong coughs with a very loud, high-pitched noise.  “High-pitched” would be [voice changes] something like this. And “low-pitch ed” would be [voice changes] something like this. I’m not sure exactly how whoop ing cough sounds. I’ve never had it or don’t know anyone who has had it.

Interestingly, we use the word “whoop” (whoop) info rmally in American English to mean a couple of different things. It can mean to d efeat or beat someone in a competition. There’s a somewhat vulgar expression t hat people use, “to whoop someone’s ***,” and the word begins with an “a” and  ends with an “s” and it’s only three letters long. You can probably guess what tha t means.

Anyway, back to the story. Jenny says, “I’ve read s omewhere that vaccines might be dangerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their  future.” “To jeopardize” (jeopardize) something or someone means to put some thing or someone in danger, in a dangerous situation. Jenny doesn’t wan t to put her children in danger by getting these vaccines. Jonas says, “That ’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.” “To opt o ut of” something means to decide not to do something, to not participate in s omething that you would normally be expected or even required to do.

Jonas says if Jenny doesn’t get her children vaccin ated, she would be putting them at risk. She would be jeopardizing their futur e, their health. Jenny says, “Why’s that?” Jonas says, “Because your children wo n’t be getting an education. The school is barring any children who don’t get im munized from attending school.” The school is barring children from attend ing school who don’t get immunized.

What does it mean “to bar” (bar) someone from somet hing? It means to prevent someone from being able to do something or from bei ng able to go somewhere. This is the verb “to bar.” It’s not related in mean ing to the noun “bar,” which is a place you go and have an alcoholic drink – what I’l l be doing right after I finish this recording. Well, no. I’m just kidding. It’s on ly 11 o’clock in the morning, a little early for me for going to a bar.

Jenny says, “I call that irresponsible!” The school  is not going to allow children who don’t get these vaccines to study in the school , to attend school. Jenny thinks that’s irresponsible. “Irresponsible” means “not responsible.” It means not doing the things that you should do. Jenny thinks it’s irresponsible of the school to bar children from attending because they haven’t  been vaccinated.

But Jonas thinks the exact opposite. He says, “That ’s exactly the word that came to my mind,” meaning that’s the same word that I th ought of when I thought about what you’re doing, Jenny, by not getting your child ren immunized.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jonas: Hi, Jenny. Are you getting your kids ready f or school, too?

Jenny: Yes, as you can see, we’re buying lots of sc hool supplies.

Jonas: Did you get the school letter reminding pare nts to submit proof of immunization before the first day of school? I know  that your youngest is starting school this year.

Jenny: Yes, she is, but I’m thinking of getting an exemption. I’m not sure vaccines are safe and I don’t want to take a chance  with her health.

Jonas: The immunizations required by the school are  standard – measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio – all vaccines your other  children have had.

 Jenny: But when I looked at the list, there were a few I didn’t recognize – diphtheria, hepatitis, and rubella. Who knows what our kids are getting!

Jonas: The ones you mentioned are standard, too. Do n’t you remember the outbreak of whooping cough last year? If our kids h ad been immunized, they wouldn’t have gotten sick.

Jenny: I’ve read somewhere that vaccines might be d angerous. I just don’t want to jeopardize their future.

Jonas: That’s precisely what you’d be doing if you opted out of immunizations.

Jenny: Why’s that?

Jonas: Because your children won’t be getting an ed ucation. The school is barring any children who don’t get immunized from a ttending school.

Jenny: I call that irresponsible!

Jonas: That’s exactly the word that came to my mind .

# Describing Position and Location Within a Group

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,134 – Describing the Position and Location within a Group.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,134. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com to become a member of ESL Podcast.  When you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this episode and al l of our current episodes. This episode is a dialogue about describing where y ou are in a group of people. Sounds simple. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Selena: Don’t look now, but a big group of mothers are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.

Justin: What?! I meant it as a joke. I didn’t mean anything by it.

Selena: You’ll have to tell that to Sally. She’s at  the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.

Justin: Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confronted b y anyone but those three.

Selena: They’re not the only ones. They’re backed b y a group of at least 15 parents.

Justin: Maybe some of those on the periphery are ju st spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.

Selena: Don’t count on it. They look determined.

Justin: Who are those in the back?

Selena: Those bringing up the rear? I think those a re a few fathers with a message of their own.

Justin: What should I do now?

Selena: Start by waving a white flag.

 Justin: And then?

Selena: Try a sincere apology, with a healthy dose of groveling.

[end of dialogue]

Our somewhat mysterious dialogue begins with Selena  saying to Justin, “Don’t Look now.” The expression “Don’t look now” is used to warn someone that something bad is happening, or that an unwanted per son is walking toward you or is nearby. “Don’t look now, but I think that’s y our mother-in-law in the car,” speaking of unwanted people. Well, Selena is warnin g Justin not about a mother- in-law, but “a big group of mothers.”

She says, “Don’t look now, but a big group of mothe rs are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.” “To give someon e a piece of your mind” means to clearly state your opinion or tell your opinion to someone, usually in anger or with some frustration toward the other person. “I’m  going to give him a piece of my mind” – I’m going to tell him what I think, and I’m going to do it in anger.

Justin says, “What? I meant it as a joke.” We’re no t sure exactly what Justin did that has made these mothers angry at him. That’s wh y it’s something of a mystery, this dialogue. Justin then says, “I didn’t  mean anything by it.” When someone says they “didn’t mean anything by it,” he means he didn’t want to hurt or offend other people by what he has said or what he has done.

After you realize that you’ve done something that s omeone else may consider hurtful, insulting, or harmful, you might say, “Wel l, I didn’t mean anything by it,” meaning you didn’t intend or mean to cause any harm . Of course, some people say that they didn’t mean anything by whatever they  said even though they really did mean to be mean.

You could say to someone for example, “Oh, that’s a  beautiful dress. Are you pregnant?” Well, if the woman isn’t pregnant but ju st is a little overweight, you might be in trouble and you could say, “Oh, I didn’ t mean anything by it,” even though perhaps you meant to be insulting to the wom an. (Something I don’t recommend, whether she’s pregnant or not.)

Selena says, “You’ll have to tell that to Sally. Sh e’s at the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.” Selena is des cribing where the different women are in this group. She begins by saying that “Sally is at the head (head) of the group.” “To be at the head” of something mea ns to be in front, or it could

also mean to be the leader of a group. “Who’s at the head of the company?” That would mean “Who is the leader of the company?”

In the dialogue, I think Selena is referring to whe re Sally is in the group. She’s the first person. She’s at the front of, or at the head of, the group. Sally is “flanked” (flanked) by Maria and Veronica. “To be f lanked” by someone means to have someone on each side of yourself – to have som eone on your left and to have someone on your right. You are flanked by two people.

Justin says, “Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confro nted by anyone but those three.” “To be confronted” by someone is to have so meone approach you and begin an argument or begin to fight with you. If yo u are confronted by your boss, your boss is going to stop you, perhaps, in the hal lway and argue with you or perhaps ask why you did something wrong. The idea of a “confrontation,” which is the noun that comes from the verb “to confront” is related to an angry situation. It means someone is angry about something, perhaps even wants to fight you over something.

Selena says, “They’re not the only ones. They’re ba cked by a group of at least 15 parents.” “To be backed” (backed) by” someone here I believe means to be followed by someone. There is a group of people tha t are right behind the three women who are in front. “To be backed by” can also mean to be supported by, even financially supported by, a group or a person.  Here in Hollywood, when someone says that he is backing a movie, he means h e is supporting the movie. “The movie is being backed by him.”

Here, it appears these three women are backed by a group of 15 parents. Justin says, “Maybe some of those on the periphery are jus t spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.” The “periphery ” (periphery) is the outside part of something, or what we might call the “edge” (edg e) of something. It’s not the main part. It’s not the center part of something. W e could talk about suburbs being on the “periphery” of the city. They’re outsi de of the city, on the edge of the city.

A “spectator” (spectator) is someone who watches so mething, who observes something, but does not participate in the activity . If you go to a professional sports game – a soccer game or a baseball game or a n American football game – you’re not actually going down and playing in the  game. You are a spectator. You’re watching it. You’re observing it. There’s ac tually a very well-known, famous magazine in Great Britain called The Spectat or , which I read every week on my iPad. You don’t even have to wait for it to a rrive from London by mail.

Anyway, Justin says that maybe some of the people o n the periphery of this group of parents are just spectators. They’re waiti ng to see what the rest of the group will do. Selena says, however, “Don’t count o n it.” The phrase “Don’t count (count) on it” is used to express doubt that someth ing will happen. “To count on” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to rel y on something or depend on something.

Justin thinks that some of the people approaching h im are just spectators. But Selena says, “Don’t count on it,” meaning you shoul dn’t rely on that fact. Don’t be so sure. She says, “They look determined.” “To be d etermined” means to be committed, to not hesitate or not to be undecided. Justin says, “Who are those in the back?” meaning at the very end of this line of people.

Selena says, “Those bringing up the rear?” “To brin g up the rear” is an expression in English that means to be the last per son, or perhaps in this case the last group of people, in a line of people. This  person or this group is following everyone else. Selena says, “I think those are a fe w fathers with a message of their own.” “A message of their own” means that the se fathers probably are also angry at Justin.

Justin says, “What should I do now?” Selena says, “ Start by waving a white flag.” “To wave (wave) a white flag,” literally means to t ake a piece of white fabric and move it back and forth in the air. The idea is that  you are showing that you do not want to fight anymore. It could also mean that you are surrendering. You are telling the other person or the other group of peop le you are fighting that you don’t want to fight anymore because they have won.

Justin then says, “And then?” meaning, “Then what s hould I do?” Selena says, “Try a sincere apology with a healthy dose of grove ling.” A “sincere (sincere) apology (apology)” is an honest statement that expr esses your regret. It’s when you tell someone that you are sorry and that you fe el badly about whatever it is you did wrong. Selena advises Justin to try a since re apology with these parents and a “healthy dose (dose) of groveling.”

A “healthy dose” of something is a large amount of something. We use the word “dose” normally when we’re talking about medicine. You are given, say, pills by your doctor for some illness. The doctor will tell you what the “dose” is – how many pills you should take each day. A “healthy dos e” of something, however, just means a lot of something. The word “healthy” h ere means a lot of.

“To grovel” (grovel) means to apologize for your bad behavior toward a certain person and to tell the person how great they are. “ To grovel” means to try to

make the person like you by both apologizing and by  telling the person how wonderful he or she is. That’s what Selena recommen ds to Justin – “a healthy dose of groveling.” “Groveling” is the noun form of  the verb “to grovel.” We never find out why these parents are so angry at Justin, but clearly he did something very, very wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Selena: Don’t look now, but a big group of mothers are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.

Justin: What?! I meant it as a joke. I didn’t mean anything by it.

Selena: You’ll have to tell that to Sally. She’s at  the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.

Justin: Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confronted b y anyone but those three.

Selena: They’re not the only ones. They’re backed b y a group of at least 15 parents.

Justin: Maybe some of those on the periphery are ju st spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.

Selena: Don’t count on it. They look determined.

Justin: Who are those in the back?

Selena: Those bringing up the rear? I think those a re a few fathers with a message of their own.

Justin: What should I do now?

Selena: Start by waving a white flag.

Justin: And then?

Selena: Try a sincere apology, with a healthy dose of groveling.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,135 – Having Hearing Problems.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Bernadette and Claude about someone who has difficulty hearing. Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bernadette: Why are you mumbling?

Claude: I’m not. I said, “What’s wrong with your he aring?”

Bernadette: Nothing is wrong with my hearing. You j ust need to speak up.

Claude: I’m practically shouting. You need to see a  doctor about your hearing loss.

Bernadette: I’m not hard of hearing. It’s probably just a buildup of earwax.

Claude: This is more serious than earwax. Do you he ar ringing in your ears?

Bernadette: Not more than usual.

Claude: Meaning you usually hear ringing sounds?

Bernadette: Sure, who doesn’t?

Claude: Uh, normal people. Have you been asking peo ple to repeat themselves? Are you having trouble hearing people when there’s a lot of background noise?

Bernadette: Maybe.

 Claude: It might be something as simple as an infec tion, but it could be more serious, like damage to your eardrum or inner ear i f you can’t hear sounds at low decibels.

Bernadette: I am not getting a hearing aid.

Claude: Would you prefer people to yell?

Bernadette: What?! Smell? You think I smell? Well, that’s just rude!

[end of dialogue]

Bernadette asks Claude, “Why are you mumbling?” “To  mumble” (mumble) means to speak in a low, soft, difficult-to-underst and voice. When someone mumbles, they go [mumbles]. It’s something that you r teenage son and daughter might do, especially if you’re asking them question s and they don’t really want to tell you the truth. They might mumble so they make it difficult for you to understand them. It’s sort of an insulting thing to  tell someone that he is mumbling. It means the person doesn’t know how to s peak properly or doesn’t want to speak properly.

Claude says, “I’m not. I said, ‘What’s wrong with y our hearing?’” Your “hearing” (hearing) is your ability to understand sounds – the ability to use your ears to hear other things, other people. We talk about the five senses that a human has. The other four are sight, which involves your eyes;  taste, which involves your tongue; touch, which involves most of the outside of your body, we could say; and smell, which involves your nose.

Now the joke here is that Claude was asking Bernade tte what was wrong with her hearing and she couldn’t hear him. Bernadette s ays, “Nothing is wrong with my hearing. You just need to speak up.” “To speak u p” is a two-word phrasal verb that can mean a couple of different things. He re it means to speak more loudly, to raise or increase the volume of your voi ce. “To speak up” can also mean to make your opinion known, especially when pe rhaps you disagree with the decision of your boss or someone in charge.

We sometimes talk about “speaking up for other peop le.” That means we are voicing our objections, we are telling other people  our opinions about things in order to try to protect or help someone else. In ou r dialogue, however, “to speak up” just means to speak more loudly. Claude respond s, “I’m practically shouting.”

The word “practically” here means almost or nearly.  “To shout” (shout) means to speak in a very loud voice, to “yell” (yell), we mi ght say.

Claude says, “You need to see a doctor about your h earing loss.” “Hearing loss” is when you start to lose your ability to hear peop le clearly and accurately. This, of course, is something that often comes as you get  older. Claude says that Bernadette should see a doctor about her hearing lo ss, but Bernadette responds, “I’m not hard of hearing.” “To be hard of hearing” means not to be able to hear very well. It may at times also be used to describe  someone who cannot hear at all.

If you can’t hear anything at all, you are what we would call “deaf” (deaf). That’s the traditional term. More recently, people have ta lked about the “hearing impaired” (impaired). Some people consider “hearing  impaired” to be a more polite way to talk about people with hearing proble ms.

Bernadette says she’s not hard of hearing. She says , “It’s probably just a buildup of earwax.” “Earwax” (wax) is a substance that is p roduced in your ears to keep germs out of your body. It’s a brown- or yellow-col ored substance. A “buildup” (buildup) – one word – is an increase in the amount  of something, often something that increases little by little over a lo ng period of time. Now, if you have a buildup of earwax, that might prevent you fr om hearing properly.

What Bernadette is saying is that she isn’t hard of  hearing. She just has a buildup of earwax that if she were to clear out, or clean o ut, would allow her to hear just fine. Claude disagrees. “This is more serious than earwax,” he says. “Do you hear ringing in your ears?” “To hear ringing (ringi ng) in your ears” is to have sort of a light, echoing noise that shouldn’t really be there. That could be a sign of hearing problems. When Claude asks her, “Do you hea r ringing in your ears?” Bernadette says, “Not more than usual.”

Claude says, “Meaning you usually hear ringing soun ds?” Bernadette responds, “Sure, who doesn’t?” Claude says, “Uh, normal peopl e.” Claude is asking Bernadette if she hears these ringing sounds. Berna dette says well yes, of course, but assumes that everyone has these ringing  sounds. Claude tells her no, they don’t. Then he asks her, “Have you been as king people to repeat themselves?” “To repeat yourself” means to say agai n what you had just said. “To repeat yourself” means – just kidding.

Claude then says, “Are you having trouble hearing p eople when there is a lot of background noise?” “Background noise” is noise that  can be heard but isn’t really what you’re focusing on. It’s not the noise that yo u want to hear. It’s all the other

noise or sound that might be present in that partic ular environment. Bernadette says, “Maybe,” meaning perhaps she does have proble ms hearing other people if there’s a lot of noise in the room, a lot of backgr ound noise.

Claude then says, “It might be something as simple as an infection, but it could be more serious like damage to your eardrum or inne r ear.” An “infection” (infection) is a medical condition where bacteria g ets inside of your body and makes you sick. Your “eardrum” (eardrum) is a part of your inner ear – the part of your ear that’s inside of your body that moves – or  we would say “vibrates” – when it is hit by sound waves, and this allows you to interpret and understand the sounds. It allows your brain to understand the soun ds.

Claude says there may be damage to Bernadette’s ear drum or inner ear that causes her not to be able to hear sounds at low dec ibels. A “decibel” (decibel) is a measure of how loud something is. “Low decibels” would be sounds that are not very loud at all. Bernadette then says, “I am n ot getting a hearing aid” (aid). A “hearing aid” is a small electronic device that you  put inside your ear to help you hear better.

As people get older, sometimes they need hearing ai ds, although many people don’t want a hearing aid. They don’t want people to  see, in effect, that they cannot hear very well, probably because it reminds them that they are old. Claude says, “Would you prefer people to yell?” “To  yell” means to talk very loudly, to shout. Bernadette says, “What?! Smell? You think I smell? Well, that’s just rude!” Claude asked Bernadette if she preferre d people to yell, but Bernadette didn’t hear him correctly. She thought C laude said the word “smell” (smell).

The verb “to smell” in this case means to have a ce rtain odor – an unpleasant smell, an unpleasant odor. If you go to the gym and  you work out, you run – well, you’re probably going to smell a little. Your body has sweated, and sometimes that’s not the most pleasant smell. It’s insulting,  of course, to tell someone that he or she smells. The other verb we might use for this  situation is “to stink” (stink).

Bernadette is surprised that Claude would insult he r in this way – that’s why she says, “You think I smell? Well, that’s just rude!” She’s saying that Claude is being “rude” (rude) to her. “To be rude” to someone means  to be mean to them, not to be very nice to them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Bernadette: Why are you mumbling?

Claude: I’m not. I said, “What’s wrong with your he aring?”

Bernadette: Nothing is wrong with my hearing. You j ust need to speak up.

Claude: I’m practically shouting. You need to see a  doctor about your hearing loss.

Bernadette: I’m not hard of hearing. It’s probably just a buildup of earwax.

This episode is a dialogue between Oliver and Alena  about missing a deadline. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Oliver: I’ve just had to tell a client that I’m run ning behind and I won’t make the deadline.

Alena: How did she take it?

Oliver: Not so well, at first. I knew she wouldn’t be happy, so I’ve been in a dilemma for days: Should I tell her now that I’m go ing to miss the deadline, or wait until the deadline had passed.

Alena: For what it’s worth, I think you did the rig ht thing. It gives her advance notice in case it affects other parts of her projec t.

Oliver: That’s what I thought, too. I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.

Alena: Did she take you up on it?

Oliver: No, she said that giving me a three-day ext ension wouldn’t set her back, but if it dragged on for longer than that, it would  put her in an awkward spot, and she would let me know.

Alena: I’m glad you came to an understanding. So yo u’ll have it done by the new deadline, right?

 Oliver: Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, fo od, or bathroom breaks for the next week.

Alena: That’s very dedicated of you, though potenti ally messy.

[end of dialogue]

Oliver begins our dialogue by saying, “I’ve just ha d to tell a client that I’m running behind and I won’t make the deadline.” A “client” ( client) is a person you work for, usually a person for whom you do some sort of servi ce. It’s sometimes used the same way we use the word “customer,” although “cust omer” usually means that the person is buying something from you, some physi cal object – a book, or a car, or a computer.

Oliver tells his client that he’s “running behind.”  The phrasal verb “to run behind” (behind) means to be late, to have something take l onger than planned so that you will probably not finish it when you are suppos ed to finish it. “I’m running behind” means I’m late. “To make the deadline” (dea dline) means to complete something when you are supposed to complete it, to complete it on time. A “deadline” is a time or a day by which you have to finish something. Here in the United States, everyone has to pay their taxes by t he 15th of April. The personal tax deadline is April 15th.

Alena says, “How did she,” meaning Oliver’s client,  “take it?” The expression here “to take it” means to accept something, to rea ct to some news, some information – usually bad information, although not  always. Someone may say, “Well my boss fired his secretary.” He fired the pe rson who was working for him. You might ask, “Well, how did he take it?” How did he react? “What was his emotional state?” you might say. Alena asks how Oli ver’s client took the information or the notification that he wasn’t goin g to make his deadline.

Oliver says, “Not so well, at first,” meaning right  after he told her. “I knew she wouldn’t be happy,” he continues, “so I’ve been in a dilemma for days.” A “dilemma” (dilemma) is a situation where you don’t know what to do. It’s a difficult or confusing situation that makes it hard or tough for you to make a decision. Often, we use this when we have two different possi ble solutions and we can’t decide which solution is better.

Oliver then tells us what the two possible solution s to his dilemma were. He says, “Should I tell her now that I’m going to miss the d eadline, or wait until the deadline has passed.” “To miss (miss) the deadline”  means to not make the

deadline. It’s the opposite of “making the deadline .” “To miss the deadline” means that you don’t complete what you are supposed  to complete on time.

Oliver’s dilemma was deciding if he should tell his  client that he wasn’t going to make the deadline – that he was going to in fact mi ss the deadline – or just wait until the deadline had passed, meaning after the de adline. Alena answers, “For what it’s worth, I think you did the right thing.” The expression “For what it’s worth” (worth) is used when we’re giving someone in formation that we hope will be helpful but often it isn’t, or perhaps you’re ju st unsure if it will be helpful or not. Alena says that she thinks Oliver did the right thi ng.

She says, “It gives her advance notice in case it a ffects other parts of her project.” “Notice” (notice) is information you give  someone about some situation. “Advance notice” would be information before the ev ent occurs. If you are going to leave at five o’clock this afternoon, you may say to your boss, “I want to give you advance notice that I’m leaving at five o’clock  today instead of my normal time at six o’clock.” If you wait until five o’cloc k to tell your boss, you are not giving advance notice, and your boss might not be v ery happy with you.

Oliver says, “That’s what I thought, too.” In other  words, yes – it was good to give her advance notice. “I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.” “To make up for” something is a very useful phrasal verb in English. It means to do something that corrects a p roblem or a mistake that you have made. It may also be used as a way of apologiz ing for a mistake that you made.

Let’s say you were supposed to take your wife out t o dinner tonight, and you can’t because you have to work late at the office. You may call your wife and say, “I’m sorry, I can’t go to dinner tonight, but I wil l make up for it by taking you to a movie tomorrow night.” I’m not sure if your wife wi ll agree that taking her to a movie makes up for going out to dinner, but that co uld be a way to use that expression. Oliver says he offered to make up for t he “inconvenience the delay (delay) would cause.” A “delay” is when something h appens later than it should, later than it was scheduled to happen.

Alena says, “Did she take you up on it?” “To take s omeone up on” something is another very useful phrase. It means to accept anot her person’s offer to do something. If someone says, “If you need a ride to the airport tomorrow, just let me know,” you could call the person later and say, “I’d like to take you up on your offer to take me to the airport.” In other words, y ou’re agreeing to let that person help you. Alena asks if Oliver’s client took him up  on his offer to make up for the

inconvenience. Oliver says, “No, she said that givi ng me a three-day extension wouldn’t set her back.”

An “extension” (extension) here means additional ti me to complete a task. If you are late on a project you are supposed to be comple ting, you might go to your boss and say, “I need an extension” – I need more t ime. Oliver’s client tells him that giving him a three-day extension would not “se t her back.” “To set (set) someone back” means to create a delay for someone e lse, to make someone else be behind schedule. You could also say, “This problem set us back” or “set me back.” It caused me to no longer be able to meet  the deadlines I was hoping to meet.

Oliver’s client told him, however, that if this del ay “dragged on” for longer than three days, “it would put her in an awkward spot.” “To drag (drag) on” is a phrasal verb meaning to last for a longer time than anticip ated – to go at a very slow pace, a very slow speed. If the delay dragged on for longer than three days, Oliver’s client said it would put her in an “awkwar d (awkward) spot (spot).” A “spot” here means a situation. An “awkward spot” wo uld be a difficult or uncomfortable situation.

Alena says, “I’m glad you came to an understanding. ” This is a very common phrase in business, “to come to an understanding.” “To come to an understanding” means to reach an agreement, to agre e on something. “My brothers and sisters came to an understanding about  what we should do with my parents’ house.” We came to an understanding. We ca me to an agreement.

Alena continues, “So you’ll have it done by the new  deadline, right?” Oliver says, “Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, food, or bathroom breaks for the next week. “To do without” something is not to do someth ing, especially when normally you would consider it a necessary thing to  do. “To do without sleep” means that you are not going to go to sleep. You’re  going to, in this case, continue working. Sleep is normally considered nece ssary, so to do without it is considered a sacrifice, a difficult thing to do.

Doing without food would also be very difficult if you did it for a week. Oliver obviously doesn’t really mean he’s going to do with out food for a week. Alena says, “That’s very dedicated of you,” and “potentia lly messy.” “Dedicated” (dedicated) means committed or devoted, wanting to do a particular thing. “I’m very dedicated to working out in the afternoon, to exercising every afternoon, which I do on a treadmill.” I’m dedicated to that. I am committed to it.

Alena says that Oliver is dedicated. He’s dedicated  to completing this task for his client, though his idea of doing without bathroom b reaks is “potentially,” or possibly, “messy.” “Messy” (messy) is unorganized o r dirty. Of course, bathroom breaks would mean going to the bathroom, and you ce rtainly do not want to do without that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oliver: I’ve just had to tell a client that I’m run ning behind and I won’t make the deadline.

Alena: How did she take it?

Oliver: Not so well, at first. I knew she wouldn’t be happy, so I’ve been in a dilemma for days: Should I tell her now that I’m go ing to miss the deadline, or wait until the deadline had passed.

Alena: For what it’s worth, I think you did the rig ht thing. It gives her advance notice in case it affects other parts of her projec t.

Oliver: That’s what I thought, too. I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.

Alena: Did she take you up on it?

Oliver: No, she said that giving me a three-day ext ension wouldn’t set her back, but if it dragged on for longer than that, it would  put her in an awkward spot, and she would let me know.

Alena: I’m glad you came to an understanding. So yo u’ll have it done by the new deadline, right?

Oliver: Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, fo od, or bathroom breaks for the next week.

Alena: That’s very dedicated of you, though potenti ally messy.

[end of dialogue]

 Our scriptwriter never misses a deadline. She’s too  organized for that. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Using Battery Power

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,137 – Using Battery Power.

This is English as a Second Language podcast episod e 1,137. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Luisa and Allesa ndro about using battery power for your electronic devices. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Luisa: The battery on my computer is almost out of juice.

Allesandro: Did you bring a spare?

Luisa: It’s a rechargeable battery, so instead of r eplacing it, I need to plug it in, but there are no outlets in here.

Allesandro: I don’t see one either.

Luisa: Forget it. I’ll just finish watching the mov ie on my phone. Oh no, my phone battery is running low, too. It’s a high-capacity b attery and is supposed to discharge slowly, giving me a full day of power. I don’t know what’s wrong with it.

Allesandro: Do you want to borrow my radio? At leas t you can listen to music for a while.

Luisa: A radio? You mean an old-fashioned radio?

Allesandro: Yeah, it uses disposable batteries and I brought plenty.

Luisa: No, thanks. I don’t think a radio will do me  any good. Maybe there’s an emergency generator around here. I just need enough  electricity to finish watching my movie.

 Allesandro: I don’t think that will do you any good , and plus, the emergency generator is supposed to be used for emergencies an d only in the event of a power failure.

Luisa: Exactly! What can be more of an emergency th an not knowing how a movie ends?

[end of dialogue]

Luisa kicks things off – that is, starts things – i n our dialogue by saying, “The battery on my computer is almost out of juice.” You r “battery” is what stores energy that you use for an electronic device. Your cell phone, your tablet, most laptop computers have batteries in them so you can use them without plugging in directly to the electrical outlet in the wall. “To be out of juice” (juice) means that your battery no longer has any power, any energy.

The word “juice” is also used, of course, for a liq uid that you drink, made from usually some sort of fruit. Think of orange juice o r apple juice or pineapple juice (although pineapple juice isn’t very popular). This  juice, however, has nothing to do with something you drink. It has to do with the power, energy remaining in your battery. (Please don’t email me and tell me th at power and energy are not the same thing. I understand that, but in conversat ional English we use those two words interchangeably often, one for the other.)

Allesandro says, “Did you bring a spare?” A “spare”  (spare) is an additional item or an additional thing that you can use as a replac ement for something else if it stops working. So, here the word “spare” really mea ns “spare battery,” an extra battery. We also, in our cars, carry a “spare tire, ” which some people often refer to simply as “the spare.” “The spare” is the extra tire or wheel you have in your car in case you have a problem with one of your tir es. We call it a “spare tire” for your car even though the tire goes around the wheel . We probably should call it a “spare wheel.” But we don’t. We usually just say a “spare tire.”

Anyway, we’re not talking about cars here, Jeff. Ge t back to the story.

Allesandro asks Luisa if she brought a spare – that  is, spare battery. Luisa says, “It’s a rechargeable battery, so instead of replaci ng it, I need to plug it in, but there are no outlets here.” There are basically two  kinds of batteries. There are batteries that you use once and then you throw away , and there are batteries that you can recharge. “To charge” (charge) something me ans to add power to it, in a

sense. So, “rechargeable” (rechargeable) is a batte ry that you can use more than once. You can add power or energy to it again so th at you can use it again.

Luisa says that she has a rechargeable battery, so instead of replacing it – that is, instead of throwing it out and putting a new ba ttery in – she needs to plug the battery in. “To plug something in” means to connect  it to a source of electricity so that it will work. If you have a television, usuall y you have to plug it in. You have to connect the television to some form of, or sourc e of, electricity.

Luisa is saying that she wants to plug her battery in so she can recharge it. “But,” she says, “there are no outlets here.” An “outlet” (outlet) is a small set of holes in the wall into which you plug something in. We may a lso call it a “power outlet” or an “electrical outlet.” One of the problems of trav eling to another country is that sometimes their outlets are different than the outl ets you have in your own country. So, you have to buy what’s called an “adap ter.” Luisa says she cannot find any outlets wherever she is there in this dial ogue.

Allesandro says, “I don’t see one either.” Luisa th en says, “Forget it. I’ll just finish watching the movie on my phone.” So apparently Luis a was watching a movie on her computer, and now she’s going to watch it on he r phone. Then she says, “Oh no, my phone battery is running low, too.” “To run (run) low (low)” means to have very little of something left – “to be running out of” something, we may also say. “I’m running low on coffee” means I don’t have very  much coffee left. “I’m running low on battery power” means my battery is almost ou t of juice.

Luisa says, “The battery is a high-capacity battery  and is supposed to discharge slowly, giving me a full day of power.” “Capacity” (capacity) refers to how much something can contain, or how big or sometimes how powerful something is. A “high-capacity battery” would be a battery that, on e presumes, you could use for a long time. Luisa says, “The battery is supposed t o discharge slowly.” “To discharge” (discharge) is the opposite of “to charg e.” So, if “to charge” is to add electrical power to a battery, “to discharge” would  be to take that away. When you use a battery, you are slowly discharging it.

Luisa thought that her high-capacity battery would give her a full day of power, a full day of use, of energy. “I don’t know what’s wr ong with it,” she says. Allesandro then asks, “Do you want to borrow my rad io?” A “radio” (radio), for those too young to remember, is a device that recei ves what are called “radio frequency waves” and uses them to produce sound. Al lesandro says, “At least you can listen to music for a while.” Luisa says, “ A radio? You mean an old- fashioned radio?” “Old-fashioned” here means someth ing that no one uses anymore.

 Allesandro says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “It uses disp osable batteries and I brought plenty.” “Disposable” (disposable) is the o pposite of “rechargeable.” A “disposable battery” is one of those batteries that  you use once and then you throw it away. A paper napkin is disposable. Once y ou use it, you can’t wash it. You just have to throw it away. Allesandro says he brought “plenty” (plenty). Here, he means plenty of batteries. “Plenty” is a l ot of something. “We have plenty of food,” meaning we have enough food for ev eryone.

Luisa says, “No, thanks. I don’t think a radio will  do me any good,” meaning it won’t help me. “Maybe there’s an emergency generato r around here.” An “emergency generator” (generator) is a machine that  produces energy when the regular supply of electricity that you get to your house or your office building doesn’t work. In some parts of the world, emergency  generators are very common because the electrical system perhaps is not  very reliable.

Some people have emergency generators in case there  is, well, an emergency – a situation that may cause the electricity to no lo nger work. Here in Southern California, it’s probably a good idea to have an em ergency generator in case we have an earthquake, where the earth begins to move and bad things can happen. Do I have an emergency generator? Of course  not, because I do not plan ahead very well, kind of like Luisa.

Luisa says, “Maybe there’s an emergency generator a round here. I just need enough electricity to finish watching my movie.” the word “electricity” here is used to mean something similar to “power” and “ener gy.” Allesandro says, “I don’t think that will do you any good,” meaning I d on’t think that will help you.

“And plus,” Allesandro says, meaning in addition, “ the emergency generator is supposed to be used for emergencies and only in the  event of a power failure.” A “power failure” (failure) is when, as I mentioned e arlier, you don’t have any electrical power coming to your house or your build ing. A “failure” is when something stops working the way it should. Allesand ro says that an emergency generator is supposed to be used “only in the event  of a power failure.” “In the event (event) of” something means if something happ ens or in case something happens.

Luisa says, “Exactly,” meaning that’s exactly what I mean. “What can be more of an emergency than not knowing how a movie ends?” Lu isa thinks that not knowing how the movie ends is an emergency, and the refore she needs an emergency generator. I suppose if you have young ch ildren and you are entertaining them by having them watch a movie on a  tablet such as an iPad and

your battery dies, it might be considered an emerge ncy because your young children may be very upset they don’t know how the movie ends.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Luisa: The battery on my computer is almost out of juice.

Allesandro: Did you bring a spare?

Luisa: It’s a rechargeable battery, so instead of r eplacing it, I need to plug it in, but there are no outlets in here.

Allesandro: I don’t see one either.

Luisa: Forget it. I’ll just finish watching the mov ie on my phone. Oh no, my phone battery is running low, too. It’s a high-capacity b attery and is supposed to discharge slowly, giving me a full day of power. I don’t know what’s wrong with it.

Allesandro: Do you want to borrow my radio? At leas t you can listen to music for a while.

Luisa: A radio? You mean an old-fashioned radio?

Allesandro: Yeah, it uses disposable batteries and I brought plenty.

Luisa: No, thanks. I don’t think a radio will do me  any good. Maybe there’s an emergency generator around here. I just need enough  electricity to finish watching my movie.

Allesandro: I don’t think that will do you any good , and plus, the emergency generator is supposed to be used for emergencies an d only in the event of a power failure.

Luisa: Exactly! What can be more of an emergency th an not knowing how a movie ends?

# Dating Nice Guys and Bad Boys

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,138 – Dating Nice Guys and Bad Boys.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,138. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, oh yeah, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

It gives you a complete transcrip t of everything we say, plus a complete glossary with all of the key terms, defini tions, sample sentences, and more.

This episode is a dialogue between Jack and Alison about dating nice guys and bad boys. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jack: I’ve had it. I’m going to start treating wome n like dirt. I’d get more dates.

Alison: What brought this on?

Jack: I got dumped again by a woman who thinks I’m too nice – too nice! She says she wants to be with someone who’s more assert ive and unpredictable. She didn’t say it in so many words, but that means she thinks I’m a wimp and I’m boring.

Alison: My guess is she wants a bad boy. A lot of w omen go through that phase. We want excitement and drama, the thrill of the cha se.

Jack: You mean they choose to be with selfish, irre sponsible jerks because it’s exciting?

Alison: I hate to say it, but it’s true. But I’m te lling you, this phase doesn’t last in most women. When we want to settle down, that’s whe n we look for the nice guys.

Jack: You mean I have to wait until then to get a n ice girlfriend?

Alison: No, I simply mean that until then, nice guy s finish last.

 Jack: Well, I’m not willing to wait.

Alison: Where are you going?

Jack: I’m going to work on my swagger and my sneer.

[end of dialogue]

Jack says to Alison, “I’ve had it.” When someone sa ys, “I’ve had it,” he means he no longer wants to continue in this situation. He i s frustrated or tired of something and will no longer continue doing what he has been doing. Jack says, “I’ve had it. I’m going to start treating women like dirt. I’d ge t more dates.” “To treat women like dirt” (dirt) means to treat them very poorly a nd rudely, with very little respect. It’s an odd thing to say. How would treating women badly get you more women interested in you? Jack will explain in a minute.

Alison asks him, “What brought this on?” The questi on “What brought this on?” is used when you are surprised by what another person has said or done, and you want to understand what caused him or her to do wha t he or she did. “What brought this on?” is usually used when someone does  something or says something that surprises us, something for which we  don’t understand the reason.

Jack says, “I got dumped again by a woman who think s I’m too nice.” “To get dumped” (dumped) is to be told by your boyfriend or  girlfriend that the relationship you have is now over. “To get dumped” means the other person says, “You know what, I don’t want to go out with y ou anymore. I don’t want to be in a romantic relationship with you anymore.” Jack says he got dumped again by a woman who thinks he’s too nice. The woman, accord ing to Jack, says that she “wants to be with someone who’s more assertive and unpredictable.”

“Assertive” (assertive) is used to describe someone  who has a lot of confidence – someone who isn’t shy, someone who does what he wan ts and gets what he wants. “Unpredictable” is the opposite of “predicta ble” (predictable). “To be predictable” means to do things that someone expect s you to do. “To be unpredictable” means to do things that other people  don’t think you will do, or don’t expect you to do. Jack says this woman who ju st dumped him wants to be with someone who’s more assertive and unpredictable .

Well, actually, we find out the woman didn’t actual ly say that. Jack says, “She didn’t say it in so many words.” The expression “in  so many words” is used to

mean “in those exact words,” “in that exact way.” S o, if you tell your boss, “Well, John isn’t coming in today. He says that he went ou t drinking last night and now he feels sick,” your boss may ask you, “What? Is th at what he said?” And you say, “Well, not in so many words,” meaning he didn’ t actually say that, but that’s what you think he meant. You’re not a very nice fri end to John, are you, if you say that to your boss? But back to our story.

Jack says that this now ex-girlfriend of his didn’t  say exactly that she wants someone who’s more assertive and unpredictable, “bu t that means she thinks I’m a wimp and I’m boring.” Jack is saying that the fac t that this woman said that he was “too nice” means that she thinks Jack is a wimp  and that he is boring. A “wimp” (wimp) is a person who is scared, who is not  strong, who perhaps is a coward. Jack is saying that the woman is telling hi m that he is a wimp.

Alison says, “My guess is that she,” this now ex-gi rlfriend of Jack, “wants a bad boy. A lot of women go through that phase.” A “bad (bad) boy” is a young man, typically (or boy, teenager) who does things that a re against the rules, who perhaps even breaks laws, because that makes him se em brave, daring, cool, popular, and attractive to at least some girls.

“To be a bad boy” means to be the young man who doe s things that are dangerous, and there are, of course, many girls who  are attracted to that sort of boy or man. I should say a little bit about the exp ression “bad boy.” It may refer not to someone who is a teenager or a boy, but to s omeone who is in fact over 18 years old, someone who we would normally call a “man.” The term “bad boy” does not mean the same as the term “bad guy.” I’ll explain that in a few minutes. Let’s go back to the dialogue, though.

Alison says that this now ex-girlfriend of Jack wan ts a bad boy. She says, “A lot of women go through that phase” (phase). A “phase” is what we would also describe as a “stage” in the development of a perso n, or it could be the stage in the development of a project. It’s a period of time , in other words, when certain things happen. What Alison is saying is that some g irls and women go through a phase, or a period in their life, when they want no t a nice guy, but a bad boy – someone who is a little, perhaps, dangerous.

Alison explains, “We want excitement and drama, the  thrill of the chase.” The expression “the thrill (thrill) of the chase (chase )” means the excitement of trying to get something that is challenging or difficult. Alison is describing what almost certainly is a very common feature in many cultures , of girls and women being attracted to men who seem very strong and sometimes  even a little dangerous.

Jack says, “You mean they choose to be with selfish , irresponsible jerks because it’s exciting?” Jack is describing these bad boys n ot as being exciting, but rather as being “selfish, irresponsible jerks.” “To be sel fish” (selfish) means to only think about your needs and your desires – not to care abo ut anyone else, including in this case, your girlfriend.

“To be a jerk” (jerk) means to be a person who beha ves badly, who is annoying to other people. The term “jerk” is an insult. You definitely don’t want to call anyone a “jerk,” unless perhaps you want to start a  fight. “Irresponsible” (irresponsible) is the opposite of, of course, “res ponsible.” Someone who is “irresponsible” is someone who is not reliable, som eone who doesn’t do what he’s supposed to do. Jack is describing these young  men that women seem to be attracted to as being “selfish, irresponsible je rks.”

Alison says, “Well, yes, actually.” Women are attra cted to these guys, these men, even though they are selfish and irresponsible, bec ause it is exciting. Alison says, “But I’m telling you, this phase doesn’t last  in most women.” In other words, most women get out of this phase at some point and no longer want to date bad boys.

She says, “When we want to settle down, that’s when  we look for the nice guys.” “To settle (settle) down” is a two-word phrasal ver b meaning to have a more predictable, steady life. Traditionally that means getting married, buying a home, and having children, starting a family. That’s usua lly what we mean by this phrasal verb “to settle down.” If you are asked by your father or mother, “When are you going to settle down?” you are being asked when are you going to get married, buy a house, have children, and so forth.

Alison says that when women want to settle down, th en they stop dating bad boys and look for the nice guys. A “nice guy” is a young man who is nice, responsible, treats other people with respect. The term “nice guys” is opposite to the term “bad boys.” Now, it’s a little confusing, because we don’t say “bad guys” to mean the opposite of “nice guys.” A “bad guy” is  someone who is truly evil, someone who is perhaps a criminal, someone who want s to hurt us. Similarly, a “good boy” is not the opposite of a bad boy. A “goo d boy” is someone who obeys the rules, who always does what he is told.

So, there are two sets of opposites here. One is “b ad boy/nice guy.” The other is “good guys/bad guys.” A “bad guy” is, for example i n a movie, the person who tries to kill other people or to hurt someone. The opposite of a “bad guy” is a “good guy.” The “good guy” is the hero, the person who does things right, the person who is the honest, trustworthy person. We of ten use “good guy” and “bad

guy” when we’re talking about movies. So Alison say s to Jack that when women are ready to settle down, they look for the nice gu ys, not the bad boys.

Jack says, “You mean I have to wait until then to g et a nice girlfriend?” Alison says, “No, I simply mean that until then, nice guys  finish last.” This expression “nice guys finish last” means really that good, res ponsible men normally don’t have success in romantic relationships, especially when they are young. Now, this changes, as Alison says, when women decide the y want to have a family. That depends on the culture and the people involved , of course.

Is there an age at which American women stop lookin g for bad boys and start wanting to settle down? I don’t know. People are ge tting married much later, much older than they used to. I would say maybe whe n I was growing up, around the ages of, say, 22 through 25, women stopped look ing for bad boys and started looking for nice guys – at least, that’s the way it  worked for me. Anyway, Jack says, “Well, I’m not willing to wait.” Alison says,  “Where are you going?”

Jack says, “I’m going to work on my swagger and my sneer.” “Swagger” (swagger) describes here a very confident powerful way that a man walks. If you have a certain swagger, you walk in a certain way t hat makes you look powerful and strong. A “sneer” (sneer) is a mean smile, usua lly on only one side of your mouth. You might sneer at someone you think is not as good as you if you want to show contempt of that person, if you want to ind icate that you don’t think that person is at perhaps the same level as you are. It’ s not a very nice thing, to sneer.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jack: I’ve had it. I’m going to start treating wome n like dirt. I’d get more dates.

Alison: What brought this on?

Jack: I got dumped again by a woman who thinks I’m too nice – too nice! She says she wants to be with someone who’s more assert ive and unpredictable. She didn’t say it in so many words, but that means she thinks I’m a wimp and I’m boring.

Alison: My guess is she wants a bad boy. A lot of w omen go through that phase. We want excitement and drama, the thrill of the cha se.

 Jack: You mean they choose to be with selfish, irre sponsible jerks because it’s exciting?

Alison: I hate to say it, but it’s true. But I’m te lling you, this phase doesn’t last in most women. When we want to settle down, that’s whe n we look for the nice guys.

Jack: You mean I have to wait until then to get a n ice girlfriend?

Alison: No, I simply mean that until then, nice guy s finish last.

Jack: Well, I’m not willing to wait.

Alison: Where are you going?

Jack: I’m going to work on my swagger and my sneer.

# Major Historical Periods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,139 – Major Historical Periods.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,139. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Take a look at our Special Courses in Business and Daily English as well as our ESL Podcast Blog. You can like us on Facebook at fa cebook.com/eslpod and follow us on Twitter at @eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue between Livy and Nichola s about the vocabulary we use in English to describe important periods or tim es in history. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Livy: Tell me again why we’re here on a Saturday af ternoon.

Nicholas: You’re going to love this museum. It has artifacts and exhibits from all the major periods in history, from prehistoric days  to the present.

Livy: Hmm, fascinating.

Nicholas: It is, isn’t it? We follow the timeline of human history from one room to the next. See? This room is devoted to ancient hist ory and ancient civilizations.

Livy: Is there a gift shop?

Nicholas: Sure, there’s one on the way out, but let  me show you a few things in this room. It’s all about the Middle Ages. Check th is out. Doesn’t it blow your mind?

Livy: Yeah, wow, great. Actually, it’s all kind of dull. Isn’t there something more exciting to see?

Nicholas: You want excitement? Then let’s skip ahea d to the rooms on the Renaissance. Look at this!

Livy: This is all great, but I’ve seen enough. Let’ s keep going.

Nicholas: We’re rushing past the best exhibits, but  if you want to keep going, I guess we can do that. These next rooms are devoted to more recent history, the Industrial Revolution and pre- and post-World War y ears.

Livy: Is there anything else?

Nicholas: You mean you’re done looking at over 3,00 0 years of historical exhibits? This is one of the best museums in the wo rld. I could spend all weekend here.

Livy: That’s because you’re a history buff. Hey, th at room is about the Information Age. Do you think I can check my email in there?

Nicholas: [sigh]

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Livy asking Nicholas a que stion – actually, it’s what we would call a command: Livy says, “Tell me again why  we’re here on a Saturday afternoon.” I should point out here that “Livy” is sometimes used as a short form of the girl’s name “Olivia,” although it would normally not be spelled this way. For those of you who know about Roman history, you’ll k now that there was a Roman historian by the name of “Livy.” But our Livy  is a woman, and she asks Nicholas to explain why, on a Saturday afternoon, t hey are at a museum.

Livy, it appears, would rather be somewhere else. N icholas says, “You’re going to love this museum.” A “museum” is a building that  teaches about art or historical objects, things of importance. Nicholas says, “It has artifacts and exhibits from all the major periods in history, fro m prehistoric days to the present.” An “artifact” (artifact) is an object tha t has been made or used by a human being, a person, usually many years ago.

An “exhibit” (exhibit) is a display of related obje cts in a museum. Art museums, for example, will often have exhibits of one artist , where they will bring paintings or sculptures from that artist from different museu ms altogether. You could have a Picasso exhibit, or a Turner exhibit, or a Jackso n Pollock exhibit. The museum that Livy and Nicholas are at appears to be a museu m of history. It has exhibits from all the major periods or times in history, fro m prehistoric days to the present.

“Prehistoric” (prehistoric) means relating to perio ds of time before humans knew how to write, or before a given civilization develo ped a writing system. The prefix “pre” means “before.” So, “prehistory” is before hu man beings were writing things

down, in effect. Livy doesn’t seem too interested. She says, “Hmm, fascinating.” Notice, even though she says “fascinating,” it’s cl ear that she doesn’t find it fascinating or interesting at all. But Nicholas doe sn’t seem to realize that Livy isn’t too excited. He says, “It is, isn’t it?”

He continues, “We follow the timeline of human hist ory from one room to the next.” A “timeline” (timeline) – one word – is the order in which events occurred. Usually, a timeline is literally a line on a piece of paper, or perhaps on a wall, that shows different years and the events that happened during those years, or whatever the period of time is. Nicholas says, “Thi s room is devoted to ancient history and ancient civilizations.” To say somethin g is “devoted (devoted) to” something means it is intended for a particular top ic. It is about a certain thing.

Now, we can use “devoted to” also in the sense of s omeone who is in love with or is very loyal to a single person or group of peo ple. You may remember the movie Grease , from the 1970s, where Olivia Newton John sang the  song “Hopelessly Devoted to You.” [singing] “Hopelessly devoted to you.” Of course, she was hopelessly devoted to the character played by John Travolta. But we’re not talking about Olivia Newton John or John Travol ta, we’re talking about a museum where there is a room devoted to ancient his tory.

In this sentence, it means that the entire room is all about this one topic. The topic is “ancient (ancient) history.” “Ancient hist ory,” at least in the Western world and Western civilization, means the period of time usually from the very earliest recorded history up to about, say, 300 or 400 A.D. “A.D.” refers to the years roughly after the birth of Jesus Christ, the founde r of the Christian religion. Years before that time are referred to in English as “B.C .,” meaning “Before Christ” – before Jesus Christ was born.

Now, more recently, historians have changed that te rminology a little. They refer to what we used to call “A.D.” as “C.E.” – meaning “Common Era” – and “B.C.” has become “B.C.E.” – “Before the Common Era.” You will see that, however, mostly in history books, in recent history books. I n most places, people will still use the A.D./B.C. designations. The word “civilizat ion” refers to an organized society in a certain place during a certain period.  We could talk about “Mayan civilization” – the people who lived on the Yucatan  Peninsula and in Central America during a certain period of time.

Livy isn’t interested in any of this. She says, “Is  there a gift shop?” Many museums have a little store where you can buy thing s, often photographs or other little pieces of artwork related to the museu m. Nicholas says, “Sure,” meaning yes, “there is one on the way out,” meaning  as we exit the museum.

“But,” he says, “let me show you a few things in th is room. It’s all about the Middle Ages.”

The “Middle Ages” is a period in European history f rom approximately 1100 to 1450 A.D., although traditionally the Middle Ages r efers to a much longer period, I think. When I was going to school, we would speak  of the time between the fall of the Roman Empire in the late 400s A.D. up throug h the fall of Constantinople in the 1450s. It depends on which book you read in terms of the definition of Middle Ages.

Nicholas says, “Check this out,” meaning look at th is, pay attention to this. “Doesn’t it blow your mind?” The expression “to blo w (blow) your mind (mind)” is one that we use to mean very interesting, very exci ting, very impressive. It’s an informal expression, “to blow your mind,” perhaps a  little dated. I’m not sure people use it as much anymore, but you will still h ear it. Livy says, “Yeah, wow, great.” Again, she’s not really interested. She say s, “Actually it’s all kind of dull” (dull). “Dull” means boring, uninteresting. “Isn’t there something more exciting to see?” she asks.

Nicholas says, “You want excitement? Then let’s ski p ahead” – let’s move ahead – “to the rooms on the Renaissance. Look at this!” The “Renaissance” (Renaissance) – and the word is capitalized, just a s are the words “Middle” and “Ages” – is a period of time in European history an d culture that usually is dated between the 1300s and the 1600s A.D.

Nicholas thinks it’s exciting but Livy doesn’t. She  says, “This is all great, but I’ve seen enough. Let’s keep going.” Nicholas objects. H e says, “We’re rushing past the best exhibits.” “To rush past” means to move qu ickly by something without taking time to look at it closely. But Nicholas und erstands that his wife or girlfriend, we’re not sure what Livy is, is kind of  bored. So he says, “I guess we can do that” – I guess we can rush past these thing s.

“These next rooms are devoted to more recent histor y, the Industrial Revolution and pre- and post-World War years.” The “Industrial  Revolution,” again capitalized, is a period of time when science and t echnology improved very quickly, usually dated from the late 1700s to, say,  the middle of the nineteenth century. Nicholas also refers to “pre- and post-Wor ld War years,” although it doesn’t say if he means World War I or World War II . But in either case, “pre” means “before” and “post” (post) means “after.”

Livy says, “Is there anything else?” Nicholas respo nds, “You mean you’re done looking at over 3,000 years of historical exhibits?  This is one of the best

museums in the world. I could spend all weekend her e.” Livy says, “That’s because you’re a history buff.” A “buff” (buff) is a fan of some hobby or some topic, someone who really enjoys a certain topican d learning all about it. Livy describes Nicholas as a “history buff” – someone wh o is interested and likes to learn about history.

Then Livy says, “Hey, that room is about the Inform ation Age. Do you think I can check my email in there?” The “Information Age” is a term that would describe our current period of history, when there has been a rapid growth and change in the economy based on computers and easy access to i nformation. We live, in other words, in the Information Age. Livy, however,  interprets this to mean a place where she can check her email on a computer, something that is probably not possible in the museum’s exhibit on the informa tion age.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Livy: Tell me again why we’re here on a Saturday af ternoon.

Nicholas: You’re going to love this museum. It has artifacts and exhibits from all the major periods in history, from prehistoric days  to the present.

Livy: Hmm, fascinating.

Nicholas: It is, isn’t it? We follow the timeline of human history from one room to the next. See? This room is devoted to ancient hist ory and ancient civilizations.

Livy: Is there a gift shop?

Nicholas: Sure, there’s one on the way out, but let  me show you a few things in this room. It’s all about the Middle Ages. Check th is out. Doesn’t it blow your mind?

Livy: Yeah, wow, great. Actually, it’s all kind of dull. Isn’t there something more exciting to see?

Nicholas: You want excitement? Then let’s skip ahea d to the rooms on the Renaissance. Look at this!

Livy: This is all great, but I’ve seen enough. Let’ s keep going.

 Nicholas: We’re rushing past the best exhibits, but  if you want to keep going, I guess we can do that. These next rooms are devoted to more recent history, the Industrial Revolution and pre- and post-World War y ears.

Livy: Is there anything else?

Nicholas: You mean you’re done looking at over 3,00 0 years of historical exhibits? This is one of the best museums in the wo rld. I could spend all weekend here.

Livy: That’s because you’re a history buff. Hey, th at room is about the Information Age. Do you think I can check my email in there?

Nicholas: [sigh]

[end of dialogue]

If in the future there’s ever a museum of podcastin g, I’m sure that there will be an exhibit about our very own scriptwriter, the wonder ful Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Dealing With a Language Barrier

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,140 – Dealing With a Language Barrier.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,140. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains a complete transcript of everything we say in this lesson. This episode is called “Dealing With” (or handling, taking care of) “a Lan guage Barrier” – when two people can’t understand each other. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Carol: Send another memo to the Gibberese office. I  think we have our wires crossed again.

Art: Don’t you think it would be better to call the  office and speak to someone there? You might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly.

Carol: I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have an yone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.

Art: Which means there’s no one who could translate  our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier.

Carol: That’s right. And plus, leaving a paper trai l is better.

Art: You mean in case we have to cover our asses.

Carol: I wouldn’t put it like that, but breakdowns in communication are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their s ource.

Art: Right. Okay, I’ll draft a memo and pass it by you before I send it, okay?

Carol: Sounds good.

Art: What I don’t understand is why we don’t simply  hire people for this office who are fluent in Gibberish.

Carol: Do you know anyone who speaks Gibberish?

Art: Plenty!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is entitled “Dealing With a Language B arrier.” “To deal (deal) with” something means to take care of something or to han dle a situation that might be difficult. This dialogue is about dealing with a “l anguage barrier” (barrier). A “barrier” is normally something that separates two people or two groups of people. A barrier might also separate two different  substances that you don’t want to mix together. A “language barrier” usually refers to when two people speak different languages and can’t communicate wit h each other.

Carol begins by saying, “Send another memo to the G ibberese office. I think we have our wires crossed.” A “memo” (memo) is a short  business document, usually just one or two pages, that has information  about a specific topic. Usually a memo is sent to people in your organization or wi thin your company. “Memo” is actually short for a longer word, “memorandum.”

Carol says, “Send another memo to the Gibberese off ice.” We’re guessing that the “Gibberese office” is another office, perhaps i n a different country. Carol says, “I think we have our wires crossed again.” the expression “to have your wires (wires) crossed” means to have a misunderstan ding – when two people or two groups of people don’t understand each other be cause one person didn’t communicate the message very clearly or the other p erson misinterpreted or misunderstood the message.

Art says, “Don’t you think it would be better to ca ll the office and speak to someone there?” Art doesn’t think it’s a good idea just to send a memo, which is – well, in the old days – a piece of paper, but now adays more typically a Word document or a PDF document, I suppose. Art says, “You might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly.”

The expression “to get to the bottom (bottom) of” s omething is a very common one in English. It means to investigate and find the real reason for something or to understand the cause of something. Often we use this expression when we’re trying to understand the reason for a problem or the cause of some problem. When there is a disaster that the government is inv olved in, sometimes officials

for the government will say, “We’re going to get to  the bottom of this” – we’re going to really find out what caused this. Of cours e, they never do, but that’s what they say.

Art says that if Carol calls the Gibberese office t hat they might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly. A “misunderstanding” as a noun means a confusion, something that wasn’t under stood correctly. Carol says, “I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have an yone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.” “Gibberish” here is used as  a real language, but it’s really a joke in the dialogue because the word “gibberish” ( gibberish) means meaningless words – words that you can’t understand, that don’t  have any meaning.

When people don’t have an answer for something or t hey want to confuse you, they might start using real words, but in such a wa y that the words don’t really convey any meaning – they don’t communicate any mes sage. They are using these words just to confuse you. Carol says, “I don ’t speak Gibberish,” which here is a real language, “and we don’t have anyone bilingual in the office.” “To be bilingual” (bilingual) means to be able to speak tw o languages.

There’s an old joke: What do you call someone who can speak three languages? The answer is “trilingual.” What do you call someon e who can speak two languages? The answer is “bilingual.” What do you c all someone who can speak only one language? The answer is “an American.” Wel l, the actual answer would be someone who is “monolingual” (monolingual). But back to our dialogue . . .

Carol says that she doesn’t have anyone in the offi ce “to act as,” or to be, “an interpreter” (interpreter). An “interpreter” is som eone who translates spoken language. “To translate” means to take the meaning of the words in one language, of course, and put them in another langua ge. A “translator” (translator) is a person who does that translation in writing. A n interpreter is someone who translates spoken language.

It’s a difference that is not always observed – tha t people speaking and writing in English don’t always follow – but technically, an i nterpreter is someone who translates spoken language. A translator is someone  who translates written language. Art says, “Which means there is no one wh o could translate our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier .” Here, Art uses the verb “to translate” to mean to take the words in one lan guage in written form and put them in another language.

Carol says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct.  “And plus,” she says, “leaving a paper trail is better.” A “paper trail” (trail) is when you have written documents

that you can show someone to prove what happened or  to demonstrate what happened. A paper trail is very useful if you think  you may be, in the future, investigated or if you need to show what happened i n a certain business transaction or business deal. A paper trail usually  would include keeping paper documents or electronic documents – emails, for exa mple – that show what happened during a certain situation.

For example, if someone hits your car and you need to contact your insurance company, you are going to want to have a paper trai l of all the things the insurance company sends you, all the things the oth er driver sends you. You need to keep all of that in case there’s a problem in the future. Carol says, “A paper trail is better than just calling someone on the telephone.” Art says, “You mean in case we have to cover our asses?” “To cover  (cover) your ass” means to protect yourself from blame, to protect yourself fr om future accusations that you did something wrong.

This expression is not one that you would want to u se unless you knew the person fairly well. It’s an informal and vulgar exp ression – I wouldn’t normally use this expression, myself. I don’t like using bad wor ds in English, but this is an expression that in fact you would probably hear in an office among people who knew each other well. A lot of people use an abbrev iation instead of the actual expression which is “CYA,” which means “Cover Your A” – and then of course the rest of the word. It’s not an expression I woul d recommend you using. We include it here so you can understand what it actua lly means.

Continuing on, then, Carol says, “I wouldn’t put it  like that,” meaning I wouldn’t express it like that, “but breakdowns in communicat ion are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their source.” A  “breakdown (breakdown) in communication” is when two people or two groups of people misunderstand each other – when the message that one group is trying t o communicate to the other is not understood correctly.

Something that is “inevitable” (inevitable) is some thing that you cannot avoid, something that will happen even if you don’t want it to happen or even if you try to prevent it from happening. Death is inevitable. You are all going to die, just like I am. It’s something you can’t avoid. There. Isn’t that a happy thought? Don’t you feel better now? You’re going to die.

Anyway, Carol says, “It’s always helpful to be able  to trace (trace) their source.” “To trace” means to follow the path or development of something. In this case, really it means to identify the source, to find out  where the breakdown in communication took place. That’s why Carol thinks it’s better to leave a paper

trail. You can see when there is a miscommunication , where that happened. If you just talk to someone on the telephone, unless y ou are recording the conversation, you can’t figure out where the proble m was, perhaps.

Art says, “Right. Okay, I’ll draft a memo and pass it by you before I send it, okay?” “To draft” (draft) something is to write the  first version of something, especially something you plan on changing or revisi ng in the future. Art is going to draft a memo and “pass it by” Carol. “To pass so mething by” someone means to give it to someone so that that person can look at it and perhaps approve it – say it’s okay – or revise it, change it so that it’ s better.

Carol says, “Sounds good,” which is an informal way  of saying yes, okay, that’s a good idea: “Sounds good.” Art says, “What I don’t u nderstand is why we don’t simply hire people for this office who are fluent i n Gibberish.” “To be fluent” (fluent) in a language means to be able to speak the language easily and smoothly like a native speaker, like someone who gr ew up speaking the language. Carol says, “Do you know anyone who speak s Gibberish?” Art responds, “Plenty” (plenty). “Plenty” means a lot o r many – more than what we need.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carol: Send another memo to the Gibberese office. I  think we have our wires crossed again.

Art: Don’t you think it would be better to call the  office and speak to someone there? You might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly.

Carol: I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have an yone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.

Art: Which means there’s no one who could translate  our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier.

Carol: That’s right. And plus, leaving a paper trai l is better.

Art: You mean in case we have to cover our asses.

 Carol: I wouldn’t put it like that, but breakdowns in communication are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their s ource.

Carol: Sounds good.

Art: What I don’t understand is why we don’t simply  hire people for this office who are fluent in Gibberish.

Carol: Do you know anyone who speaks Gibberish?

Art: Plenty!

# Proofreading a Document

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,141 – Proofreading a Document.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,141. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. But first you have to become a member of ESL Podcast, and why not ? When you become a member, you get access to all of our current Learni ng Guides for all of our current episodes.

This episode is a dialogue about proofreading a doc ument – going through something you write to make sure that there aren’t any mistakes in it. Well, let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russell: Hey, LeeAnn, you were an English major, ri ght?

LeeAnn: Yes.

Russell: Could you proofread this for me?

LeeAnn: I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for structure?

Russell: For everything.

LeeAnn: So you’re asking me to fact-check all of the facts and figures and to parse each line to find any spelling, grammar, or p unctuation errors.

Russell: That’s right. I used the spell-check on it , but some typos may have slipped through. I wouldn’t be surprised if it were  riddled with other errors, too.

LeeAnn: Right. What about the formatting?

Russell: Check that, too. You can edit out the erro rs as you go along.

LeeAnn: You want me to proofread and  edit it?

Russell: Sure, if you don’t mind.

LeeAnn: You do realize that this is a 400-page docu ment, right?

Russell: Is there a problem?

[end of dialogue]

Russell begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey LeeAnn,  you were an English major, right?” An “English major” is someone who majored i n, or specialized in, a certain topic in college. I was a Spanish and history major . Those were the areas that I studied in-depth when I went to college, when I was  at the university. Usually we talk about “major” when we’re talking about someone ’s undergraduate degree, someone’s bachelor’s degree. So, if someone says, “ I was a psychology major,” he means he studied psychology in college. That was  the area that he specialized in.

LeeAnn answers Russell’s question by saying, “Yes,”  meaning yes, I was an English major. Russell says, “Could you proofread t his for me?” “To proofread” (proofread) a document means to look at it to make sure there are no errors, or to find the errors so that someone else can fix the m. LeeAnn says, “I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for struc ture?”

“Content” here refers to the ideas and the words us ed to present information. “Structure” (structure) refers to how the document is organized. “Content” usually refers to the message that you are trying to commun icate, the ideas of your document. “Structure” refers to how the document is  organized. Russell says, “For everything,” meaning for both content and stru cture. LeeAnn then says, “So, you are asking me to fact-check all of the facts an d figures and to parse each line for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.”

“To fact-check” means to make sure that everything that you say in a document is true, to research whether the things that you say are in fact correct. So, for example, if I’m talking about the history of the Un ited States and I’m giving certain information about the presidents, someone w ho is fact-checking my article would have to go back and make sure that wh at I say about each president is correct – that I have their names corr ect, and the dates of birth correct, and so forth.

“Facts and figures” (figures) is an expression mean ing the information that you present in a document, often including numbers. “Fi gures” is another word for numbers, such as statistics in a table or a graph. So, “facts and figures” means

the specific details, including numbers and other s tatistical information, that might be in your document. LeeAnn mentions “parsing each line to find any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.”

The verb “to parse” (parse) here means to analyze s omething by taking a whole and breaking it down into its parts. Normally “to p arse” is used to mean to analyze a sentence into its different syntactical f unctions: this is a verb, this is a noun, and so forth. But here, LeeAnn is using it in  a more general way to mean to look at something and examine each of its parts. the parts here would be the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of this document .

“Spelling,” of course, refers to making sure that t he letters you use are in the correct order and are the correct letters. English spelling can be very difficult for someone who doesn’t read a lot. The word “to,” for example, could be spelled (to), (too), or (two), depending on which meaning y ou are trying to communicate.

“Grammar” (grammar) is something you’re probably al ready familiar with – it’s the structure of language, the rules that are typically  followed when using a language. “Punctuation” refers to the use of period s, commas, apostrophes, colons, and other marks that you see in the written  form of a language that help you understand it better.

Russell says, “That’s right. I used the spell-check  on it, but some typos may have slipped through.” “Spell-check” is a function that is found in many word processing programs, including Microsoft Word, that  helps you identify words that were spelled incorrectly. A “typo” (typo) is a word  that was misspelled or a word that has some mistake in it that was accidental. It  wasn’t because the person writing it didn’t know the correct way of, say, spe lling the word, but rather that he accidentally put down the wrong letters and therefo re created a word that was misspelled.

“To slip (slip) through” means to not be noticed, e specially something that is an error, a mistake. Sometimes there are errors that s lip through our editors – mistakes that we don’t find, we don’t notice. We wo uld use the verb “catch.” “We didn’t catch the mistakes. We didn’t catch the erro rs.” Russell says, “I wouldn’t be surprised if it were riddled with other errors, too .” If something is “riddled (riddled) with” something, it has a lot of that something tha t you don’t want. If something is “riddled with errors,” it is full of errors. It has  lots of mistakes in it.

LeeAnn says, “Right. What about formatting?” “Forma tting” (formatting) refers to the way that something is arranged on the page. If you are creating a document in a word processing program like Word, you have to  select the font – the way

that the letters look – the size of the letters, an d so forth. This is all part of the formatting. Russell says, “Check that too,” meaning  yes, look at the formatting when you proofread the paper.

He then says, “You can edit out the errors as you g o along.” “To edit (edit) out” something means to identify them and remove them – in this case, to find the mistakes and correct them. LeeAnn then says, “You want me to proofread and edit it?” Russell says, “Sure, if you don’t mind.” “If you don’t mind” means if that’s okay with you.

LeeAnn says, “You do realize that this is a 400-pag e document, right?” The word “document” that I have been using throughout my exp lanation here means written materials that have information about somet hing. A document is anything that contains information that is written either in  electronic form or in paper form. Notice that LeeAnn says, “You do realize.” “Sometim es we add the verb “do” even though we could just say “you realize.” The “d o” gives emphasis to the verb. It gives emphasis to the idea.

For example, if your friend says to you, “I’m going  to ask that girl sitting at the next table for her telephone number,” and you know this girl already has a boyfriend, you could say, “You do know that she has  a boyfriend, right?” You could’ve just said, “You know she has a boyfriend, right?” But the use of the verb “do” there is to emphasize – to put stress, if you will, on the meaning of the verb. LeeAnn then says, “You do realize that this is a 40 0-page document, right?

Russell then says, “Is there a problem?” “Is there a problem?” means “Is there something wrong with that?” Of course, Russell is a sking LeeAnn to do a lot of work, and we’re not sure if Russell is actually going to pay LeeAnn anything to do that work. It doesn’t sound like it from the dialog ue. If I were LeeAnn, I’d probably say no.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Russell: Hey, LeeAnn, you were an English major, ri ght?

LeeAnn: Yes.

Russell: Could you proofread this for me?

LeeAnn: I don’t know. Do you want me to proof it for content or for structure?

 Russell: For everything.

LeeAnn: So you’re asking me to fact-check all of the facts and figures and to parse each line to find any spelling, grammar, or p unctuation errors.

LeeAnn: You do realize that this is a 400-page docu ment, right?

Russell: Is there a problem?

Our dialogues are not riddled with errors in Englis h, we hope, because they’re written by the greatest scriptwriter on the Interne t – our very own Dr. Lucy Tse.



# A Boating Accident

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,142 – A Boating Accident.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Liset and Mark talking about being in the water on a boat and having, unfo rtunately, an accident. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Liset: I should never have gotten on this boat. We’ re going to sink. I know it!

Mark: Calm down. The water is a little rough today,  but there’s nothing to worry about. You have your life jacket on, right?

Liset: Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat.  We need to start bailing right now!

Mark: Don’t be ridiculous. That’s just a little sea  spray. Sit down and relax.

Liset: Look out! There’s another boat over there!

Mark: It’s just passing by. We might feel its wake,  but we’re not going to capsize. I promise you that.

Liset: How long do you think we can survive adrift on the water?

Mark: We are not going to sink. I’m telling you.

Liset: I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an is land. I hope to see my family again someday.

Mark: All right, we’ll return to the shore. It’s cl ear that you’re not enjoying this.

Liset: I didn’t know we’d be sailing in the middle of a squall.

Mark: There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all. I’ m sorry I didn’t wait for a completely calm day to take you out on your first b oat ride.

Liset: My first and last!

[end of dialogue]

Liset says to Mark, “I should never have gotten on this boat.” Liset is regretting getting on this boat. She wishes she had not gotten  on the boat. A “boat” (boat) is a form of transportation that floats in the water. A big boat is called a “ship” (ship). Be careful how you pronounce that. Liset sa ys, “We’re going to sink.” “To sink” (sink) as a verb means for something that is floating on top of the water to go to the bottom of the water. So, if a boat “sinks ,” the boat goes to the bottom of the water – maybe the bottom of the ocean or the bo ttom of the lake. Of course, you don’t want your boat to sink.

Liset says, “I know it!” meaning I know it’s going to sink. Mark tells her, “Calm down,” meaning don’t get excited, don’t get anxious . “The water is a little rough today, but there’s nothing to worry about,” he says . To describe the water as “a little rough” (rough) means not calm, with a lot of  sudden the movements. The word “rough” as an adjective often means the opposi te of “smooth.” Here, it means the opposite of “calm.” The water is moving a round a lot, and of course that would mean the boat is moving around a lot as well.

Mark says, “You have your life jacket on, right?” A  “life jacket” (jacket) is like a piece of clothing that you wear, except it allows y ou to “float” (float) in the water, meaning you won’t sink. “To float” is the opposite of “to sink.” A life jacket usually looks like a vest. It has a very bright color. It g oes around the upper part of your body, just as you would have a regular jacket that you might wear out when it’s cold out.

Liset doesn’t seem to be paying attention to Mark, however. She says, “Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat.” “To splash”  (splash) means for liquid to rise up and hit against something, usually resultin g in several small drops of liquid – in this case, drops of water. What’s happe ning is that the water is hitting

the side of the boat, or the sides of the boat, and  perhaps is coming inside of the boat a little bit.

Liset is very afraid. She says, “We need to start b ailing right now!” “To bail” (bail) here means to use some containers, such as a bucket  or a pail, to scoop or to gather the water and throw it out of the boat so th at the boat doesn’t sink. If water begins to come into the boat, you may have to “bail ” the water out of the boat. You may need to take something to get the water out  of your boat so that your boat doesn’t sink.

Mark says, “Don’t be ridiculous” – don’t be silly. “That’s just a little sea spray.” “Sea (sea) spray (spray)” is when you get a little bit of ocean or sea water that comes into the boat after it splashes against the s ides of the boat. If you’ve ever taken a boat out onto the ocean or to the sea, you probably have experienced sea spray if you stand near the edge of the boat cl ose to the water. Sea spray, then, is just water that you may feel on your face or on your body that comes off of the sea or the ocean (the two words mean the sam e thing, “sea” and “ocean”) while you are in a boat.

Mark tells Liset to “sit down and relax,” but Liset  isn’t going to relax. She says, “Look out! There’s another boat over there!” The ex pression “look out” is usually used to warn someone that something is going to hit  him, or perhaps he is going to accidentally hit something or someone else. Lise t is worried that the boat that she is in is going to hit another boat that is near by or close. Mark says, however, “It’s just passing by,” meaning it’s just travellin g past us, travelling by us. It’s not going to hit us.

He continues, “We might feel its wake, but we’re no t going to capsize.” When a boat travels through water, whether it’s on a lake or on an ocean, often, especially if it’s a big boat, there are waves that  are produced by the boat itself – water that goes off either side of the boat that tr avels through the water, or looks like it’s traveling through the water. These are wh at we call “waves” (waves). Well, when you have a large boat, the large boat co uld produce waves. It could have a “wake” that might cause problems for the boa ts around it, the smaller boats around it. That’s what Liset is worried about .

Mark says, however, that the boat that they are in is not going to “capsize” because of the waves caused by the other boat. “To capsize” (capsize) means for a boat to turn over in the water so that the to p of the boat is actually in the water and the bottom of the boat is out of the wate r. Of course, that’s not the way you want the boat to be. What Mark is saying is tha t the wake of this larger boat

will not “capsize,” will not turn the boat that the y are in upside down. He says, “I promise you that.”

Liset says, “How long do you think we can survive a drift in the water?” “To be adrift” (adrift) means that you are floating in the  water – your boat is floating in the water, but you don’t have any way of moving on your own. You don’t have a motor or any other way of controlling or powering y our boat. Mark doesn’t answer the question directly. He just says, “We are not go ing to sink. I’m telling you.”

The phrase “I’m telling you” is when you are emphas izing something to someone who doesn’t believe you. The person doubts you, and  so you are trying to make sure that the person understands that what you are saying is true. Liset continues, “I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an island.” “To be marooned” (marooned) means to be abandoned and trap ped on an island without any way of leaving it. This doesn’t happen very often nowadays with modern communication and other ways of finding peop le, but it could still happen.

You saw that Tom Hanks movie, perhaps a few years b ack, which I really hated. I hated that movie. I can’t go into it right now bu t I didn’t like it. I think it was called something like Castaway . In English it was called Castaway . A “castaway” (castaway) is a person who is marooned on an island . What I hated about the movie, in case you’re interested, is that at the en d of the movie . . . Oh well, I better not tell you in case you haven’t seen it. I hated the ending of the movie. Let me be very clear about that.

Anyway, we’re talking about a boating accident here , and Liset is wondering how long they’ll be marooned on an island. She says, “I  hope to see my family again someday.” Mark says, “All right, we’ll return to the shore.” It’s clear that Liset and Mark are not going to be marooned on an island and that Liset is just exaggerating, imagining problems.

The “shore” (shore) is the area of land that is dir ectly next to an ocean, a lake, or another what we would call a “large body of water.”  We might also use the word “coast” (coast) here. The United States has two coa sts. It has the West Coast (that’s where I live) on the Pacific Ocean and the East Coast, which is on the Atlantic Ocean. I’m not counting Hawaii and Alaska here, which are also of course on the Pacific Ocean, or have coasts on the Pacific Ocean.

The word “shore” usually refers to either a smaller  section or part of the coast of an ocean or to the area of land for a lake. We don’ t normally talk about the coasts of a lake. You could, however, for a very la rge lake, such as the Great

Lakes of North America – Lake Superior, Lake Michig an, and so on. I guess when I hear the word “coast,” I usually think of an  ocean, and when I hear the word “shore,” I think of a lake, although as I say,  we could use “shore” also to refer to perhaps a smaller part of the coast of an ocean or a sea.

Mark says they’re going to return to the shore beca use it’s clear Liset isn’t enjoying the boat ride. Liset says,” I didn’t know we’d be sailing” – going out into the water – “in the middle of a squall” (squall). A  squall is a very strong windstorm over the ocean that can be very dangerous. Mark say s, “There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all.” A “breeze” (breeze) is a gentle  wind, a wind that is not very strong. A squall would be a huge storm. A breeze is  usually something you consider very pleasant. It’s a small movement of ai r, a very light wind.

Mark says, “I’m sorry I didn’t wait for a completel y calm day to take you out on your first boat ride.” A “calm (calm) day” would be  one in which there is no movement of the water or no wind. Liset, however, s ays that she doesn’t really want to go on another boat ride. She says, “My firs t and last!” meaning this will be the last time that she goes out on a boat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Liset: I should never have gotten on this boat. We’ re going to sink. I know it!

Mark: Calm down. The water is a little rough today,  but there’s nothing to worry about. You have your life jacket on, right?

Liset: Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat.  We need to start bailing right now!

Mark: Don’t be ridiculous. That’s just a little sea  spray. Sit down and relax.

Liset: Look out! There’s another boat over there!

Mark: It’s just passing by. We might feel its wake,  but we’re not going to capsize. I promise you that.

Liset: How long do you think we can survive adrift on the water?

Mark: We are not going to sink. I’m telling you.

 Liset: I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an is land. I hope to see my family again someday.

Mark: All right, we’ll return to the shore. It’s cl ear that you’re not enjoying this.

Liset: I didn’t know we’d be sailing in the middle of a squall.

Mark: There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all. I’ m sorry I didn’t wait for a completely calm day to take you out on your first b oat ride.

Liset: My first and last!

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Alonso and Virginia about fixing or repairing an appliance – a machine in your house that does some work for you, such as a dishwasher or a clothes dry er. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Virginia: Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

Alonso: Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that dry er yourself. We need to call in an authorized repairman or repairwoman.

Virginia: Do you have any idea what they’ll charge?

Alonso: All right, then I’ll call a handyman and se e if he knows anything about fixing dryers.

Virginia: If he doesn’t, he might make matters wors e. I think it’s just a matter of clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.

Alonso: Yes, but which one? We should just upgrade to a newer model.

Virginia: This dryer does not need to be replaced. It’s not that old.

Alonso: But it’s been on the fritz on and off for a  year.

Virginia: I don’t want to throw out a perfectly goo d appliance just because of a minor problem.

Alonso: Well, this “minor problem” is the reason I had to walk to work in damp clothes this morning.

Virginia: That wasn’t so bad, was it?

Alonso: In the middle of winter?! You try walking w ith icicles in the most uncomfortable places!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Repairing an Appliance.” An  “appliance” (appliance) is any machine, powered usually by electricity, that perfo rms tasks in the home, such as a dishwasher, a washing machine, a toaster, a coffe e maker – all of these could be called “appliances.” Our dialogue begins with Vi rginia asking Alonso, “Hand me that screwdriver, will you?” “To hand” someone s omething means to give it to the person, to put it in the person’s hand.

Virginia asks for a “screwdriver,” which is a speci al tool used for putting in and taking out small metal pieces called “screws” (scre ws). A “screw” is used usually to connect two pieces of material, such as two piec es of wood in a chair. Alonso says, “Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that drye r yourself.” “To fix” (fix) means the same as to repair. When something is broken, when s omething isn’t working properly, you may try to repair it, to fix it. Virg inia is trying to fix a “dryer” (dryer) which is an appliance you use to dry wet clothing.

Alonso says, “We need to call in an authorized repa irman or repairwoman.” “To call in” is a phrasal verb meaning to get someone t o come to your house or your business, usually to fix something or to help you w ith something. An “authorized (authorized) person” is someone who has official pe rmission to do something. For example, if you own an Apple computer, you can take it to a person or a store to get it fixed. The person might be “authori zed by Apple,” meaning Apple has said, “Yes, this person knows how to fix our co mputers.”

Some companies have authorized repair places – or r epair “shops,” we might call them – that you can use to bring your broken applia nce or broken machine and get it fixed. Alonso thinks they should call an aut horized repairman. A “repairman” is a person who fixes something. Now, m ore recently we have started to use “repairman” to refer only to a male human being who fixes things. That’s why Alonso says a “repairman or a repairwoma n.” I suppose we might also say a “repairperson,” meaning you’re not sure if it’s a man or a woman.

Virginia says, “Do you have any idea what they’ll c harge?” “To charge” (charge) here means to request an amount of money in order to do something. If you go to get your car fixed, the mechanic – the person who f ixes your car – will charge you something for doing it. He will say, “You have to pay me a thousand dollars.” That’s what he is charging you.

Virginia asks Alonso, “Do you have any idea what th ey’ll,” meaning the repair people, “charge?” This particular question, “Do you  have any idea,” is usually used when you are angry or perhaps surprised that a nother person thinks something that you think is clearly wrong, or doesn ’t have the information that the person should have. If your wife says, “I think we should drive from New York City to Los Angeles for our vacation,” you might sa y, “Do you have any idea how long it will take to drive from New York to Los Ang eles?” You’re surprised that your wife is suggesting this.

Anyway, Alonso says, “All right, then I’ll call a h andyman and see if he knows anything about fixing dryers.” A “handyman” (handym an) is a person whose job it is to fix things, usually someone who isn’t an expe rt or doesn’t have formal training in doing the kinds of things that he does.  But sometimes a handyman will, in fact, have some education. Usually handyme n don’t have licenses or official permissions to do things, but they know ho w to do them.

Many people, instead of going out and, say, getting  an electrician to fix a problem in their home with the electricity, will hire a han dyman – someone who doesn’t have the same education and training but may know h ow to fix smaller problems that you have in your house. Virginia says, “If he doesn’t,” meaning if he doesn’t know anything about fixing dryers, “he might make m atters worse.” The phrase “to make matters (matters) worse” means to make a b ad situation even worse, to make a problem bigger than it is right now.

Virginia says, “I think it’s just a matter of,” mea ning it only requires, “clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.” A “clog” (clog ) is when you have something blocking the flow of water through a pipe. If your kitchen sink is “clogged,” the water won’t go down into the pipes. The pipe is clo gged. There’s something blocking it, and sometimes you need to do something  to get that clog removed. You may need to pour some sort of chemical into the  pipe. I don’t know, I’m not a plumber. I’m not a person who fixes things like clo gged pipes.

Virginia thinks the problem with this dryer is a cl og, which is kind of unusual since dryers don’t normally have clogs. They don’t usuall y use water, although I suppose you could have a clog in a pipe connected t o a dryer that goes to the

outside. You know, sometimes clothes dryers have a pipe that goes to the roof or goes to the outside wall. There might be a clog in that, I suppose.

Virginia also thinks the problem might be a “worn ( worn) component (component).” A worn component would be a piece of something that has been used so much that it’s no longer doing what it’s su pposed to be doing. You can think of your tires on your car being worn. They ha ve been used so much that they no longer are able to do what they are suppose d to do. You have to get them replaced. Alonso says, “Yes, but which one?” m eaning which part, which component is worn.

He then says, “We should just upgrade to a newer mo del.” “To upgrade” (upgrade) means to buy a newer version of something . So if you own, say, an iPhone 4, you might want to upgrade to an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 6. You might want to buy the newer “model” (model). The model is  the version of a product. The iPhone 4, 5, and 6 are three different models of the iPhone.

Virginia says, “This dryer does not need to be repl aced.” “To replace” something means to bring something in to do what the machine is doing now – basically, to get a different machine. She says, “It’s not that o ld,” meaning it’s not very old. Alonso says, “But it’s been on the fritz on and off  for a year.” “To be on the fritz” (fritz) means not to be working reliably, not to be  working correctly. It’s an informal expression, “to be on the fritz.” You don’ t hear it as much anymore, but you can still use it.

If something is happening “on and off,” it isn’t ha ppening all the time. If you describe your relationship with a girlfriend as bei ng “on and off,” that means that sometimes she is your girlfriend and sometimes you break up and are not going out together, and then perhaps later she becomes your girlfriend again. It’s “on and off.” Why? I don’t know. She’s not my girlfrien d.

Virginia says, “I don’t want to throw out” – that i s, I don’t want to get rid of – “a perfectly good appliance just because of a minor,” or not very important, “problem.” “Perfectly good” means there’s nothing w rong with it. It’s good enough. It works. Alonso says, “Well, this minor pr oblem is the reason I had to walk to work in damp clothes this morning.” “Damp” (damp) means slightly wet or a little moist. Alonso is saying that he had to wal k to work in “damp clothes” because the clothes dryer wasn’t working.

Virginia asks, however, “That wasn’t so bad, was it ?” meaning that isn’t really that bad. What are you complaining about? Alonso sa ys, however, “In the middle of winter?! You try walking with icicles in the mos t uncomfortable places!” We

learn that Alonso had to walk to work in damp cloth es in the middle of winter, and of course if it’s in the middle of winter and you h ave water, sometimes icicles form. An “icicle” (icicle) is a long pointed piece of ice, usually formed when water is dripping from a high surface such as a roof or t he branch of a tree.

Now of course, in the case of Alonso, he probably d idn’t actually have icicles on his clothing. He’s just telling Virginia that he do esn’t want to walk to work in damp clothing in the wintertime when it’s cold out, and I can understand that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Virginia: Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

Alonso: Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that dry er yourself. We need to call in an authorized repairman or repairwoman.

Virginia: Do you have any idea what they’ll charge?

Alonso: All right, then I’ll call a handyman and se e if he knows anything about fixing dryers.

Virginia: If he doesn’t, he might make matters wors e. I think it’s just a matter of clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.

# Being Assertive and Meek

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,144 – Being Assertive and Meek.

In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Victor and Maura about someone who is assertive, someone who gives h is or her opinion with great confidence, and someone who is meek – someone  who is not very strong or perhaps likes to keep quiet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: We need to take the bull by the horns. In t he meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more hemming and ha wing.

Maura: You’re right. We need to tell them what we r eally think and be done with it.

Victor: Definitely. We’ve been conciliatory long en ough. Today, we need to be insistent without being too pushy.

Maura: Being unassuming and deferential has its pla ce, but not if we seem meek. We need to be assertive without being too in- your-face.

Victor: You’re absolutely right. One of us has to s peak up.

Maura: Yes, one of us has to be bold. They’ll have to take us seriously this time.

Victor: Okay, ready?

Maura: Sure, I have your back.

Victor: Huh? I thought you were going to do the tal king.

 Maura: Uh, I thought you were.

Victor: Maybe we should wait for the next meeting t o take them on.

Maura: I totally agree. It’ll give us a little time  to work up to it.

Victor: Exactly!

[end of dialogue]

Victor begins our dialogue by saying, “We need to t ake the bull by the horns.” “To take the bull (bull) by the horns (horns)” means to  deal directly with something that is very difficult without hesitating, without delaying – to do it right now. A “bull” is an animal, a male animal whose opposite i s the “cow,” the female animal of that particular kind of animal. A bull has “horn s” – things that stick out of its head. Bulls are known, at least in the popular imag ination, of being very difficult to control, of being dangerous. So, to take a bull by its horns would be a very dangerous thing to do. You could get hurt.

This expression, then, “to take the bull by the hor ns” means to try to take care of something that is very difficult or challenging. Vi ctor says, “In the meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more he mming and hawing.” The expression “to give it to someone straight” means t o tell someone the truth in a very simple and direct way. We might say in a “stra ightforward” way. “I’m going to give it to you straight.” I’m going to tell you the  truth even though it might hurt you, even though it might be difficult for you to a ccept.

The expression “hemming (hemming) and hawing (hawin g)” is a somewhat unusual one. “To hem and haw” means to speak indire ctly. It’s the opposite, in a way, of giving it to someone straight. “To hem and haw” is to speak very indirectly or, I think more commonly, not to make a  decision – to go back and forth, to keep talking about something without actu ally coming to a decision. Someone who doesn’t want to make a decision or want s more time to make a decision might hem and haw.

Well, Victor is saying that they’re not going to he m and haw. They’re going to “give it to them straight,” whoever they are. Maura  says, “You’re right,” meaning you’re correct. “We need to tell them what we reall y think and be done with it.” The expression “to be done with it” means to finish  something and leave nothing undone, to make sure that you’ve completely finishe d whatever it is that you’re doing.

 Often we use this expression when the thing to be d one is perhaps somewhat painful, or something you don’t really want to do. If you’re going to break up with your girlfriend or your boyfriend, some people say it’s better just to tell them directly and “be done with it.” Don’t wait or give hints over a period of weeks that maybe you’re not happy in your relationship and so forth. Some people would say, “Just do it and be done with it.”

Victor agrees with Maura. He says, “Definitely. We’ ve been conciliatory long enough.” “To be conciliatory” (conciliatory) means to try to find a peaceful resolution to a problem, especially when one or bot h people who disagree about something are angry or upset. “To be conciliatory” means to try to end a conflict or a disagreement in such a way that the other pers on or the other group of people isn’t angry or upset. If you have a disagree ment with your wife or your husband, you might try to be conciliatory later on.  You might try to say nice things to them so that he or she is no longer angry. This isn’t always easy, of course. It depends what you said.

Victor says, “Today, we need to be insistent withou t being too pushy.” “To be insistent” (insistent) means to be demanding, to no t accept no for an answer. Someone who is insistent continues to try to win the argument or get what he wants. Someone who is “pushy” (pushy) is someone wh o is insistent but in a very forceful way, someone who tries to make other peopl e do what he wants. “Pushy” is always a negative way of describing some one. You can be insistent without being pushy. “To be pushy” means to go too far, to be too forceful.

Maura agrees. She says, “Being unassuming and defer ential has its place, but not if we seem meek.” “To be on unassuming” (unassu ming) means to be modest, not to want other people to pay attention t o you, not to consider yourself the best person in the room, not to be arrogant. So meone who is unassuming is humble is modest. Maura says, “Being unassuming and  deferential has its place.”

“To be deferential” (deferential) means to be very respectful of people who are more powerful, or perhaps who are older, but so muc h so that you let them make all the decisions. “To be deferential” means usuall y to be too respectful of people, to let other people do everything or make all of the important decisions. I should add that being deferential isn’t always a bad thing , although it’s often used in a negative sense nowadays, perhaps because we all wan t to get our own way. No one wants to be deferential anymore.

Maura says, however, that being deferential “has it s place,” meaning sometimes it’s okay. “But,” she continues, “not if we seem me ek” (meek). “To be meek” here means to do what other people want you to do usuall y, to be humble. “To be meek,” however, can mean simply to be quiet and gen tle. It doesn’t have to be a bad thing, but Maura uses it here in a negative way , perhaps because we’re talking about something related to business, where people often think that being meek is the same as being “weak” (weak).

Maura says, “We need to be assertive without being too in-your-face.” “To be assertive” (assertive) means to be forceful and con fident, but still in a respectful way. “To be assertive” is not to be pushy. “To be a ssertive” means to show confidence to get what you want, to be someone who is willing to say what he wants and insist upon it.

Maura thinks they should be assertive without being  “too in-your-face.” “To be in- your-face” means to be confrontational, to be argum entative – to argue with someone, to directly challenge someone in order to win an argument or to get what you want. It’s similar to being pushy, but it refers specifically to someone who confronts another person – who argues with anot her person or says things to another person that would make him angry.

Victor agrees. He says, “You’re absolutely right. O ne of us has to speak up.” “To speak up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to giv e your opinion, especially when in the past you’ve been quiet. “To speak up” m eans to actually voice or tell someone what you’re thinking. Maura agrees. She say s, “Yes, one of us has to be bold.” “To be bold” (bold) here means to be dire ct, to be forceful, to be brave – not to be shy, not to be meek. She says, “They’ll h ave to take us seriously this time.”

Victor says, “Okay, ready?” Maura says, “Sure, I ha ve your back.” “To have someone’s back” (back) means to support someone who  is taking action. You’re not the person taking the action, but you’re helpin g that person. You’re supporting that person. Maura thinks that Victor is  going to be the one to speak up. Victor obviously thought Maura was going to be the one to speak up because he says, “Huh? I thought you were going to do the t alking,” meaning you were the one who was going to actually speak. Maura says , “I thought you were.”

Victor says, “Maybe we should wait for the next mee ting to take them on.” “To take someone on” means to start an argument or a di sagreement with someone, to confront someone. Maura says, “I totally agree,”  meaning “I completely agree.” “It’ll give us time to work up to it.” “To work up to” something is a phrasal verb meaning to slowly prepare for something so that you  are ready for it.

 So, after all this discussion about how they were g oing to give it to them straight, how they were going to be insistent, and so forth, it turns out that neither Maura nor Victor really wanted to be the one to speak up,  to do the talking. This of course is a common problem. People are very brave u ntil it comes to the point where they actually have to do something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: We need to take the bull by the horns. In t he meeting today, we’re going to give it to them straight, no more hemming and ha wing.

Maura: You’re right. We need to tell them what we r eally think and be done with it.

Victor: Definitely. We’ve been conciliatory long en ough. Today, we need to be insistent without being too pushy.

This episode is a dialogue about cooking. Hmm, make s me hungry. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gisela: That smells wonderful!

Danny: This is my family’s recipe. The secret is in  the combination of seasonings we use.

Gisela: I can see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.

Danny: To get a bold flavor, we use a lot of aromat ic seeds, barks, and roots.

Gisela: How much do you put in of each one?

Danny: Precise measurements aren’t really necessary . I put in a pinch of this and a dash of that. I add them to taste.

Gisela: So getting the recipe wouldn’t do me any go od, huh?

Danny: I’m afraid not. I learned how to make this i n my mother’s kitchen.

Gisela: Would you teach me if I volunteered to be y our apprentice, doing all of your prep work?

Danny: That depends.

Gisela: On what?

Danny: On how quick you are with this potato peeler .

[end of dialogue]

Gisela says to Danny, “That smells wonderful! Danny  replies, “This is my family’s recipe.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written in structions about how to make a particular kind of food. Danny says, “The secret” –  that is, the secret to the success of this recipe – “is in the combination of seasonings we use.” “Seasonings” (seasonings) refers to things you put in food to give them a certain flavor.

There are lots of different things that could be co nsidered “seasonings.” Gisela tells us a little bit about those. She says, “I can  see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.” The most common kinds of seasonings are, in fact, “herbs and spices .” That’s why the title of this episode is “Using Herbs and Spices in Cooking.”

“Herbs” (herbs) – notice that in American English, the “H” is silent; you don’t pronounce it – are leaves or other green parts of a  plant that are used for seasoning food, to give food a certain flavor. You can also use herbs, or at least some people do, to make tea or even to make a kind of medicine, something to help you if you are sick. There are two different k inds of herbs. There are “dried herbs” and “fresh herbs.” Something that is “dried”  is something that has been, we would say “dehydrated,” meaning all the water ha s been removed from it.

“Fresh herbs,” then, would be plants or parts of pl ants that still have some water in them, that still look and feel like they did whe n they were in the ground growing. Dried herbs are herbs that don’t have any water in them and that you can put in a jar, in a container and use many weeks  or months later. Herbs always come from the leafy or green parts of a plan t. Some examples of herbs include oregano, thyme, basil, parsley, and rosemar y. Those are all common herbs used in cooking.

Another kind of seasoning for food is what is calle d a “spice” (spice). “Spices” also come from plants, but they come from the non-g reen and non-leafy part of the plant. In other words, any other part of the pl ant that isn’t the leaf or the green part and is used for seasoning is called a “spice.”  Examples of spices include cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and pepper. Tho se are all common spices. Spices are usually used after they are dried. That’ s the most common way of using spices in cooking.

 Gisela notes that Danny has “30 different dried and  fresh herbs and spices on this counter.” A “counter” (counter) in a kitchen i s a flat surface, a flat place where you can put your bowls and your ingredients f or your food. Danny says, “To get a bold flavor, we use lots of aromatic seed s, barks, and roots.” “Bold” (bold) means strong or forceful. If we have a “bold  flavor” (flavor), we have a taste that is very strong, a flavor that is very st rong.

Danny says they use a lot of “aromatic (aromatic) s eeds (seeds), barks (barks), and roots (roots).” “Aromatic” refers to something that has a very strong scent, a very strong but nice smell. The “seed” of a plant i s the small part that carries the necessary information in order to have a new plant come to life, a new plant to grow. That’s how plants typically reproduce themsel ves. Humans reproduce themselves in a slightly different way. I will not explain that to you here.

The term “bark” is usually associated with a tree –  the outermost layer of a tree. Something like a hard skin that goes around a tree.  That’s “bark.” “Roots” are the parts of the plants that are underneath the ground,  typically. “Roots,” “barks,” and “seeds” are all ways of getting spices – places in a plant, if you will, where spices come from. Gisela says, “How much do you put in eac h one?” How much of these seasonings, I’m guessing. Danny says, “Precis e measurements aren’t really necessary.”

Something that is “precise” (precise) is something that is exact – one tablespoon, one teaspoon, one ounce. Those are precise measures  of something. Danny says, however, that precise measurements aren’t nec essary. He says, “I put a pinch of this and a dash of that.” A “pinch” (pinch ) of something means a small amount of something. You’ll sometimes see that in a  recipe. It’ll say “a pinch of salt.” That means just a little bit of salt. Simila rly, you will see the word “dash” (dash) of some ingredient. “Dash” here also means a  small amount.

Usually, it refers to a small amount of something t hat is in a container, what we would call a “shaker” (shaker). If you have salt an d pepper in your kitchen, they are probably in what we would call, in English, “sh akers” – small containers that have holes on the top of them. A “dash of salt” wou ld be to take the salt shaker and maybe move it once over the food. A “pinch of s alt” would be to take some salt in your fingers and put it into the food. Ofte n, it can mean the same amount of salt. It’s just a different way of describing the manner or way in which you put the seasoning into the food.

Danny says, “I add them,” meaning the seasonings, “ to taste.” “To add something to taste” means to put it in and then to taste the food to see how it tastes and to

determine whether you need more of that ingredient.  Gisela says, “So getting the recipe wouldn’t do me any good, huh?” Danny says, “ I’m afraid not. Gisela is asking if she can get a copy of the recipe and then  cook the food herself. Danny says no, really, you can’t because he does so much to taste. You would have to know what the taste is in order to make this recipe  correctly. He says he learned how to make it “in his mother’s kitchen.”

Gisela says, “Would you teach me if I volunteered t o be your apprentice, doing all of your prep work?” An “apprentice” (apprentice) is  someone usually who is studying some sort of career, some sort of technica l career or trade – learning how to do it by watching someone else. There are ma ny different kinds of jobs were you learn most of what you need to know by bei ng an apprentice. Plumbing, carpentry, and in some ways being a chef are all things that are learned best by being an apprentice, by working wit h an expert – someone who already knows what he’s doing.

That’s what Gisela wants to do. She wants to “volun teer” – that is, not be paid – to be Danny’s apprentice. She’ll do all of his “pre p (prep) work.” “Prep” stands for “preparation. “Prep work” in a kitchen is doing all  the things that you have to do to get the ingredients ready. It may involve chopping up or slicing vegetables, getting meat or other kinds of protein prepared. Th ese are things you do before you put them all together in order to make the dish  that you are making, the food that you are making.

Danny answers Gisela’s question by saying, “That de pends.” Gisela says, “On what?” meaning what does it depend on? Danny says, “On how quick you are with this potato peeler.” Danny says he will give G isela a job if she’s good at using a potato peeler. A “potato peeler” (peeler) i s a small tool, almost like a knife, that is used to remove the skin from a potat o. A “potato” is a kind of plant that is usually white inside and is cooked in water  or using some sort of heat in order to make the inside of the plant soft in order  to eat it.

Potatoes can be eaten with or without the covering that goes around the potato. We call that covering the “skin” (skin), just like you have skin on your body. “Peeling potatoes,” means taking the skin off of the potato. It is often considered a very dull and uninteresting job. When I was growi ng up, I would often peel potatoes for my mother. I come from an Irish-American family. Potatoes are a popular dish with Irish Americans because they were  popular (and still are) in Ireland, so it’s no surprise they continue to be po pular with Irish families living in the United States.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Gisela: That smells wonderful!

Danny: This is my family’s recipe. The secret is in  the combination of seasonings we use.

Gisela: I can see that. You must have 30 different dried and fresh herbs and spices on this counter.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,146 – Negotiating with a Street Vendor.

This episode is a dialogue between Sean and Patrice  about trying to buy something from a person who sells things – not in a  store but on the street. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sean: Just look at the quality of that. You won’t f ind a finer one anywhere.

Patrice: It’s nice, but it’s more than I want to sp end.

Sean: Okay, just for you, I’ll knock off 10 percent . What do you say?

Patrice: I think it’s still too pricey. I think I’l l pass.

Sean: Wait! Don’t be so hasty. What you have there is a one-of-a-kind item. You don’t want to pass up something this special.

Patrice: I’ll think about it . . .

Sean: How about if I throw in a second one for the same price, a two-for-one offer?

Patrice: I thought you said this was one of a kind.

Sean: Did I? I meant to say that there aren’t many out there like it. I just happen to have two. How about it?

Patrice: I think I’ll shop around first.

Sean: This offer is only good right now, so don’t w alk away.

Patrice: Like I said, I’ll think about it . . .

Sean: All right. Name your price. Make me a reasona ble offer and I’ll let you have it.

Patrice: How about 30 percent off?

Sean: That’s highway robbery! I’m just a street ven dor trying to make a living here.

Patrice: Take it or leave it.

Sean: All right, you have a deal. You drive a hard bargain. You wouldn’t be looking for a job, would you?

[end of dialogue]

Sean says to Patrice, “Just look at the quality of that.” The use of the word “just” here is mostly for emphasis. It could be a good thi ng or a bad thing. When Sean says, “Just look at the quality of that,” he means it is something of very high quality. He wants Patrice to pay attention to it. H e says, “You won’t find a finer” – that is, better – “one anywhere.”

Patrice says, “It’s nice, but it’s more than I want  to spend.” “To spend” (spend) means to use your money to buy something. Sean says , “Okay, just for you” – meaning not for any other customer, but just for yo u – “I’ll knock off 10 percent.” I should mention that sometimes people who are sellin g things will use that expression, “just for you,” to make you feel specia l, of course, to make you think that you are the only one that this vendor, this pe rson selling something, would give a discount to.

Sean says he’ll “knock (knock) off 10 percent.” “To  knock off” is a phrasal verb that here means to lower the price of something. Se an is going to lower the price, or “knock off,” 10 percent. “What do you say?” Sean  asks Patrice what her reaction is. That’s what he means by, “What do you say?” Really, he’s asking, “Will you buy it at that price?” Patrice, however, responds, “I think it’s still too pricey.” When you say something is “pricey” (pricey ), you mean it’s expensive. It costs too much.

 Then she says, “I think I’ll pass.” “To pass” here means not to do something – to decide against, in this case, buying something. Wha t Patrice is doing here, of course, is telling the vendor, the person selling t he product, that she doesn’t want it. Sean says, however, “Wait! Don’t be so hasty.” “To be hasty” (hasty) means to do something without thinking about it carefully, to do something quickly. He says, “What you have there is a one-of-a-kind item. ” “One-of-a-kind” (kind) means unique, different from everything else.

Sean, of course, is trying to convince Patrice to b uy this thing. She doesn’t seem interested, so he’s trying to give her reasons to b uy it. He says, “You don’t want to pass up something this special.” “To pass up” is  a two-word phrasal verb which here means something similar as “to pass.” It  means to decide not to do something that is available or that is being offere d to you – in this case, not to buy the thing that the vendor is selling. We’re not  sure exactly what that thing is.

Patrice says, “I’ll think about it.” Usually when p eople say, “I’ll think about it,” especially if they’re at a store, it usually means,  “No, I don’t really want it.” But you’re being nice. You’re being polite. It’s someth ing people will often say to a person who is selling something when they don’t rea lly want to buy it. Sean knows this, and so he then says, “How about if” – m eaning what if – “I throw in a second one for the same price, a two-for-one offer? ”

“To throw (throw) in” something is to add something  without charging something extra to the person. So, if you go to the store to buy a new suit which usually includes a jacket and a pair of pants, the store mi ght “throw in” a tie. It may say, “Well, if you buy this suit, we’ll give you a tie f or free.” That’s basically what they’re saying. Sean is saying that he can “throw i n a second one,” meaning another one of what it is that Patrice is looking a t to buy for the same price – a “two-for-one offer.” “Two-for-one” means that you o nly pay the price of one thing, but you get two of that thing.

Patrice says, “I thought you said this was one of a  kind?” Patrice doesn’t understand and neither do we. How you could have tw o things that are one of a kind? That doesn’t make any sense. If it’s “one of a kind,” there’s only one of it in the whole world. Sean, knowing that of course he wa s lying, says, “Did I?” meaning “Did I say that?” “I meant to say,” what I really should have said, “that there aren’t many out there like it,” meaning there  aren’t very many of them. “I just happen to have two. How about it?”

“I just happen to” means almost by chance, or fortu nately. “How about it?” is Sean’s way of asking whether Patrice is now interes ted in buying the product.

Patrice says, “I think I’ll shop around first.” Tha t’s another thing a person will say when she’s not really interested in buying somethin g from a shop owner or a salesperson. “To shop around” simply means to go to  other stores and look for things you want to buy.

Sean says, “This offer is only good right now, so d on’t walk away.” When Sean says the offer is “only good right now,” he means h e can only give Patrice this price right now. If she comes back tomorrow, he won ’t be able to give her that low price. Sean tells Patrice not to “walk away,” m eaning don’t literally walk away from him to go to, say, another store, because if s he does, she won’t be able to get this good price. Patrice says, “Like I said, I’ ll think about it.” Sean says, “All right. Name your price.”

The expression “name (name) your price” means you t ell me how much you want to pay for it. You could actually use this phrase “ name your price” in a situation like this one where the person is asking you how mu ch you would pay for something, or in a situation where you need to be p aid a certain amount of money to do something. For example, your friend mig ht ask you to drive him 100 miles tomorrow to go to a certain place, and you sa y, “Well, I’m not sure.” Your friend may say, “Name your price,” meaning how much  money do I have to give you to drive me to this place tomorrow.

Sean says to Patrice, “Make me,” meaning give me, “ a reasonable offer and I’ll let you have it.” A “reasonable offer” is a fair pr ice, a fair amount of money. Patrice says, “How about 30 percent off?” She’s ask ing for a discount of 30 percent. Sean says, however, “That’s highway robber y!” The expression “highway (highway) robbery (robbery)” refers to a s ituation where one person is getting very little money for what he’s selling. “R obbery” means to steal something from someone.

Sean says, “I’m just a street vendor.” A “street ve ndor” is a person who sells things on the street without a store, a permanent p lace to sell things. He says, “I’m just a street vendor trying to make a living h ere.” “To make a living” means to earn or to get enough money to pay for your expense s – your food, your housing, and so forth. Sean is saying that Patrice is asking  for too low of a price.

Patrice says, however, “Take it or leave it.” That phrase, “take it or leave it,” is used when you are telling the person that this is y our final offer. This is the only thing that you will accept. If you don’t want it, I ’m going away. “Take it,” meaning accept my offer, “or leave it” – that is, I’m going  to walk away and we are ending our negotiations, our discussions over the price of  this object. Sean says, “All right, you have a deal,” meaning, “Okay, yes. I wil l sell it to you.”

 Then he says, “You drive a hard bargain” (bargain).  “To drive a hard bargain” means to be very good at getting what you want in a  negotiation. Someone who drives a hard bargain is someone who gets a very lo w price for something by negotiating very well. Sean then says, “You wouldn’ t be looking for a job, would you?”

What Sean means is that he thinks Patrice would mak e a good employee. She would make a good saleswoman, and perhaps maybe she  would be interested in working with Sean selling whatever it is Sean sells . We’re still not sure exactly what Sean is selling here, but whatever it is, we k now that Patrice got a 30 percent discount off of it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sean: Just look at the quality of that. You won’t f ind a finer one anywhere.

Patrice: It’s nice, but it’s more than I want to sp end.

Sean: Okay, just for you, I’ll knock off 10 percent . What do you say?

Patrice: I think it’s still too pricey. I think I’l l pass.

Sean: Wait! Don’t be so hasty. What you have there is a one-of-a-kind item. You don’t want to pass up something this special.

Patrice: I’ll think about it . . .

Sean: How about if I throw in a second one for the same price, a two-for-one offer?

Patrice: I thought you said this was one of a kind.

Sean: Did I? I meant to say that there aren’t many out there like it. I just happen to have two. How about it?

Patrice: I think I’ll shop around first.

Sean: All right. Name your price. Make me a reasona ble offer and I’ll let you have it.

Patrice: How about 30 percent off?

Sean: That’s highway robbery! I’m just a street ven dor trying to make a living here.

Patrice: Take it or leave it.

Sean: All right, you have a deal. You drive a hard bargain. You wouldn’t be looking for a job, would you?

# Types of Students in School

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,147 – Types of Students in School.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,147. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESLPod Spec ial Courses in Business and Daily English. You can also like us on Facebook  at Facebook.com/eslpod. And follow us on Twitter at @eslpod, of course.

In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Cheech and Boo about types of students in the school – the names t hat we give different kinds of students in a school, especially a high school. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cheech: Is this your old yearbook?

Boo: Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my closet.

Cheech: Look at your picture! You look like you wer e an honor roll student.

Boo: Don’t be fooled. I was just an average student , not the valedictorian, but not a dropout either.

Cheech: Who is that? She’s very pretty.

Boo: That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything. She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.

Cheech: So she was a nerd.

Boo: No, not at all. She was also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body president.

Cheech: Wow, she must have been popular.

Boo: She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up. She got alon g with everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders. She was frie nds with geeks and goths, too. Everybody liked her.

Cheech: Where is she now? Do you still keep in touc h?

Boo: Yes, of course. She’s doing very well and is v ery successful.

Cheech: And single?

Boo: Yeah, but you’re not her type.

Cheech: And what type is that?

Boo: You? Definitely a druggie.

[end of dialogue]

Cheech begins our dialogue by asking Boo, “Is this your old yearbook?” A “yearbook” (yearbook) – one word – is a book publis hed at the end of a school year, usually for a high school, that has photograp hs of all the students and teachers in the school, as well as photos and perha ps stories about the athletic teams, the clubs, and other activities at the schoo l. Most American high schools have a yearbook that students can buy. When I was i n high school, I was the editor of my school yearbook, meaning I was the per son responsible for picking the photographs and helping write the descriptions in the yearbook.

True story: I actually wrote something in the yearb ook at the very end of the book that the teachers – especially the leader of the sc hool, the principal – didn’t like, and so before the book was given to the rest of the  students, they went through and cut out that piece of paper (half a piece of pa per, actually) and then gave the books out so all the books were missing a half a pi ece of paper, a half a page at the end of the book. Well that’s a long story. We’l l talk about that some other time.

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Cheech asks Boo, “Is that your old yearbook?” Boo says, “Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my c loset.” Cheech says, “Look at your picture! You look like you were an honor roll student.” The “honor (honor) roll (roll)” is a list of the best students in the school – or to be more precise, the students who got the best grades that quarter, or s emester, or perhaps even year. Sometimes the schools will put up a list of t he students with the best grades. The idea, of course, is to try to encourage  students to get better grades.

 Cheech says that Boo looks like she was an honor ro ll student, perhaps because she looks intelligent. I don’t know. Boo says, “Don ’t to be fooled,” meaning don’t think that just because I looked smart, I was smart . She says, “I was just an average student” – that is, not a great student, no t a bad student. She says that she was “not the valedictorian, but not a dropout e ither.” The “valedictorian” (valedictorian) is the best student in a given scho ol.

The valedictorian is the student that has the highe st grades, the best grades, throughout their entire time at that school. Usuall y at the graduation ceremony, when the school celebrates the end of the schooling  of a certain group of students who are graduating from the school, there is a recognition of the valedictorian, and sometimes the valedictorian gets  to give a little speech at the graduation ceremony. So, the valedictorian is the b est student in the school. At the other end, we have someone who is a “dropout” ( dropout). A dropout is a person who doesn’t complete their schooling.

In the United States, in many states you only have to go to school until you’re 16 years old. After that, if you don’t want to go to s chool anymore – to high school, that is – you can drop out. You will be a “dropout”  – someone who doesn’t complete his schooling, his education. Of course, y ou can also go to college and then be a dropout, but we don’t normally talk about  college dropouts. Usually when we talk about a “dropout,” we’re referring to a high school dropout.

Cheech says, “Who is that? She’s very pretty.” Boo says, “That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything . She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.” A “GPA” is a grade point average. Basically, it’s the number that is calculated from all of your grad es. Traditionally, high schools give a certain number of points to a grade. So the grade of A is four points, the grade of B is three points, the grade of C is two p oints, and so forth. You take all of the grades and then you come up with an average grade. We call that the “grade point average,” or more commonly, simply the  “GPA.”

Boo is telling us that her friend Marlene had a hig h GPA, which means she was a very good student, and “took every available AP cla ss.” “To take a class” means to be a student in that class, to study that subjec t. “AP” refers to “Advanced Placement.” Advanced Placement or AP courses are sp ecial high school courses that at the end of the year have special exams. If you score very well on these exams, you can get college credit. Many universitie s will give you a certain number of credits if you get a high score on these exams.

These exams of course cost money, and most students  who take the exams don’t get a high enough score to get credit. But of  course the company, the private company that gives the exam still gets your  money. So, it’s a great way for the company to make a lot of money. Not such a great way for students to get college credit. In any case, the Advanced Placement  courses in a high school are considered the most difficult, often the ones that are hardest to get a good grade in. My high school didn’t have any AP courses, prob ably because we weren’t smart enough to be in those kinds of classes.

Cheech responds to Boo’s description of Marlene by saying, “So she was a nerd.” A “nerd” (nerd) is a smart person but one wh o doesn’t seem to be able to get along with other people or, perhaps more correc tly, is a little socially awkward. A nerd is a person who can get good grades  but doesn’t seem to be very good at talking to other people or relating to  other people. Boo says, “No, not at all,” meaning Marlene was not a nerd. “She w as also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body preside nt.”

A “jock” (jock) is an informal term for an athlete,  especially a student who likes to play sports, although it doesn’t necessarily have t o be a student. “Student clubs” are groups or organizations that usually the school  itself organizes and are for students who have different interests. There might be a photography club or a writing club. These clubs usually have meetings aft er school or outside of the regular student classes. To be the “student body pr esident” means to be the elected leader of all the students. The “student bo dy” refers to the entire group of students, all of the students in the school.

It’s common in American high schools for the school  to have an election where all the students vote for a president, and often vi ce president, of the entire school. Now, this is a little different from a simi lar term, “class president.” Each level in a high school (that is, in a typical high school), a ninth grade, tenth grade, eleventh grade, and twelfth grade – those are the f our levels. Each of those levels also elects leader called a “class president .”

In addition, there is what’s called a “student gove rnment,” sometimes called a “student council.” That is the group that organizes  events for the school. So, the “student body president” is, in a sense, the presid ent of the student council, the leader of the student council. But everyone votes o n who will be the student body president. And in addition, each class – each level , each grade – also has a president. So, there are lots of presidents in Amer ican high schools it would seem. Was I ever student body president or even stu dent class president? Absolutely not.

Cheech says, “Wow, she,” meaning Marlene, “must hav e been popular” – that is, she must have been well liked. Boo says, “She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up.” The term “stuck (stuck) – up (up)” means arrogant, someone who thinks he or she is better than everyone else. It’s the kind of term that you would hear in a high school. You don’t hear people use that term ve ry much in an adult conversation, but I suppose you could use it. Boo s ays that Marlene “got along with” – was friendly with – “everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders.”

Boo means that Marlene was friendly and was able to  get along with everyone, not just the people who you might expect a popular student to get along with – the football players and the cheerleaders. A “cheer leader” (cheerleader) is someone who, well, cheers or encourages people at a  sporting event, typically, to yell and to support the athletic team that’s pla ying. In an American high school, boys on the football team and girls on the cheerlea ding squad, or the team of cheerleaders, are usually the most popular students  in the school. Was I a football player or a cheerleader? Of course not.

Boo says, “She was friends with geeks and goths, to o.” A “geek” (geek) is similar to a nerd. It’s a very smart person who knows a lot  about especially scientific or technical topics, but might not be the most sociabl e person. A “goth” (goth) is a person who enjoys wearing black clothing (often lea ther, chains) and listens to a certain kind of music. Was I a goth? I would have t o say no. Besides, there weren’t any goths in the school I went to. I must h ave gone to school before that became popular.

Cheech says, “Where is she now,” meaning where is M arlene now? Where does she live? “Do you still keep in touch?” – that is, are you still in communication? Do you still talk to each other? Boo says, “Yes, of  course. She’s doing very well and is very successful.” Cheech then asks, “And sin gle?” meaning is she not married or not involved in a romantic relationship?

Boo says, “Yeah, but you’re not her type,” meaning you’re not the kind of man she would be interested in. Cheech says, “And what type is that?” Here, Cheech is asking what type, what kind of person Boo thinks  that he is, not what kind of person Marlene is interested in. Boo says, “You? De finitely a druggie.” A “druggie” (druggie) is a person who consumes illega l drugs. Was I a druggie when I was in school? No, not really. We didn’t hav e any drugs when I was in school. In fact, I’m so old there weren’t any drugs  when I was in school. Yeah, it’s true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Cheech: Is this your old yearbook?

Boo: Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my closet.

Cheech: Look at your picture! You look like you wer e an honor roll student.

Boo: Don’t be fooled. I was just an average student , not the valedictorian, but not a dropout either.

Cheech: Who is that? She’s very pretty.

Boo: That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything. She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.

Cheech: So she was a nerd.

Boo: No, not at all. She was also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body president.

Cheech: Wow, she must have been popular.

Boo: She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up. She got alon g with everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders. She was frie nds with geeks and goths, too. Everybody liked her.

Cheech: Where is she now? Do you still keep in touc h?

Boo: Yes, of course. She’s doing very well and is v ery successful.

Cheech: And single?

Boo: Yeah, but you’re not her type.

Cheech: And what type is that?

Boo: You? Definitely a druggie.

This episode is a dialogue between Mona and Leonard o about the way we describe people’s faces. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: How is the portrait coming along?

Leonardo: I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.

Mona: This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist. If you do a good job with this portrait, you may get other commissions.

Leonardo: It’s all the same to me. I paint them as I see them.

Mona: Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A p ortrait has to be flattering, doesn’t it?

Leonardo: You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked noses, and double chins? No way. That’s what makes each face distinct ive.

Mona: Maybe that isn’t the best way to think about it. Everybody has an image of themselves in their mind’s eye. You would just be c apturing that image.

Leonardo: I’m an artist, not a psychologist. If the y have squinty eyes, ears that stick out, a weak chin, or thin lips, that’s what I ’m going to paint.

Mona: But this sketch shows a really prominent fore head and a receding hairline. Maybe you could just . . .

Leonardo: No! I have to be true to my art. I’m not compromising.

 Mona: [sigh] I was just hoping you could finally ma ke enough money to move off of my couch!

[end of dialogue]

Mona begins by asking Leonardo, “How is the portrai t coming along?” A “portrait” (portrait) is a formal painting – or nowadays, phot ograph – of a person. It could be either one. Normally a portrait is of the person ’s upper body – his head, neck, shoulders, perhaps his chest. Many governments have  official portraits of their leaders, for example. A famous person might want a portrait of himself or herself. Mona asks how the portrait is “coming along,” meani ng how is it going.

Usually when you ask someone how something is “comi ng along,” you are implying that the person has started it already, an d you want to know how much progress he’s made. Leonardo says, “I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.” A “sketch” (sketch) is a simple drawing that is made, often when you are preparing to paint something – paint a portrait  or a picture. Sometimes people like to sketch just to get ideas for their p ieces of art, for their paintings. Leonardo is “done with” – that is, he has completed  – the sketches for the portrait.

Mona says, “This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist.” A “commission” here refers to a request for an artist  to do something, usually in exchange for money. A rich person may commission a portrait of his family, or of his wife, or of himself. Sometimes governments will  give money to artists; they will commission a piece of art – a painting or perh aps a piece of music. Mona says, “This commission is quite a godsend” (godsend ). A “godsend” is something that is very fortunate, something that seems to com e from heaven, something that is very beneficial for you.

Mona says, “If you do a good job with this portrait , you may get other commissions.” Leonardo says, “It’s all the same to me.” He doesn’t seem to care if he gets other commissions. He says, “I paint the m as I see them.” Mona says, “Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A portra it has to be flattering, doesn’t it?” Mona is saying that Leonardo needs to paint the portrait of whomever he’s painting so that the person looks beautiful, that t he person looks good. That’s what we mean by the word “flattering” (flattering).  Something that is “flattering” makes someone feel good, or important, or in this c ase, attractive.

The verb “to flatter” means to tell someone how goo d they look or how important they are – “to pay someone a compliment,” we might also say. Mona says, “A portrait has to be flattering.” It has to make the person look good. Leonardo says, “You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked no ses, and double chins? No way.” “To downplay” means to act as if something  were smaller or less important than it actually is. Another verb here wo uld be “to de-emphasize” the importance of something. “To downplay the importanc e” of something is to act as though it isn’t very important.

Leonardo then lists, or gives us a list of, the fea tures or things that you might see in a person’s face that are not very attractive. Th ese include “bulging eyes,” “hooked noses,” and “double chins.” A “bulging (bul ging) eye (eye)” is an eye that sticks out from the surface of the face and it appe ars to be larger than it should be. Some people have very bulging eyes, very big ey es. The eyes seem too big for the face. A “hooked (hooked) nose” is a nose th at seems to have a bend or a curve in the upper half of it.

“Double chins” are chins that are fat. Your “chin” (chin) is the bottom part of your face, below your mouth. If you have a “double chin, ” you may have some extra fat in your face that makes it look as though you h ave a second chin below your regular chin, I guess you could say. Leonardo doesn ’t believe in downplaying these features, these things that are part of one’s  face, or could be part of one’s face. He says, “That’s what makes each face distinc tive” (distinctive). “Distinctive” means different, unique.

Mona says, “Maybe that isn’t the best way to think about it. Everybody has an image of themselves in their mind’s eye.” What Mona  is saying is that each person has an image or a way that he sees himself, a way that he imagines himself or she imagines herself. Your “mind’s (mind ’s) eye” is the way that you think about something, the way you imagine somethin g. Mona says, “You would just be capturing that image.” She’s saying that the purpose of the portrait is to try to get the image that the person has of himself  in his own mind.

Leonardo, however, says, “I’m an artist, not a psyc hologist. If they have squinty eyes, ears that stick out, a weak chin, or thin lip s, that’s what I’m going to paint.” Once again, Leonardo gives us a list of facial feat ures – that is, things that you notice about a person’s face. These include “squint y (squinty) eyes.” “Squinty eyes” are eyes that are partially closed. It almost  looks as though the person may be falling asleep.

If your ears “stick out,” your ears go out or exten d out from your head farther than what would be normal. Some people say President Oba ma has ears that stick

out, that go out away from his head farther than yo u might normally expect ears to go. I don’t know if that’s true or not. In gener al, the phrasal verb “to stick out” means to extend outward from the surface of somethi ng.

We also use that phrasal verb to refer to something  or someone who is very noticeable, often in a bad way. If you go to the be ach dressed in a suit and a tie, you will “stick out” because everyone else will be different – everyone else will be dressed differently than you are dressed. That’s an other meaning of the phrasal verb “to stick out.” Leonardo also mentions someone  having a “weak (weak) chin.” A “weak chin” is a chin that you almost don’ t notice, a chin that doesn’t seem to be very distinctive, almost as though it’s part of your neck or that you don’t have a chin.

Leonardo says he’s going to paint people how they l ook. He’s not going to try to hide these somewhat unattractive facial features. M ona says, “But this sketch shows a really prominent forehead and a receding ha irline.” Your “forehead” (forehead) is the top of your head above your eyes and below where most people have hair. A “prominent (prominent) forehead” is a forehead that doesn’t have very much hair covering it, or perhaps is a forehea d that is bigger than you would normally expect.

Your “hairline” (hairline) is the line that is form ed by your hair – where your hair ends, if you will, at the top of your head. Now, so me, particularly men, as they get older have what’s called a “receding (receding) hai rline.” “Receding” comes from the verb “to recede,” which means to draw back or t o go back. A receding hairline is when you start losing your hair so that you don’ t have a lot of hair at the front of your head.

Some of us have receding hairlines and have decided  to simply get rid of all of our hair so you don’t notice it. I know someone lik e that. Mona is once again pointing out to Leonardo that there are some facial  features in his portrait that the person who commissioned the portrait might not be v ery happy about. Leonardo, however, says, “No! I have to be true to my art.” “ To be true to” something means to defend it or to be loyal to it, not to do anythi ng that would hurt it.

There was an old song by the Beach Boys called “Be True to Your School,” meaning, I suppose, that you were supposed to be lo yal to your school. In particular, I think the song was about a person’s h igh school. “To be true to your school” would be to support it, not to say bad thin gs about it. I don’t know if I can be true to my high school. But certainly, some peop le feel great loyalty to the schools that they attended, that they were students  in.

Leonardo was talking about being true to his art. H e says, “I’m not compromising.” “To compromise” means to not do what  you want to do – to perhaps change things in order to get along with so meone else, or in this case, to make the person who commissioned the portrait happy . Mona is disappointed. She says, “I was just hoping you could finally make  enough money to move off of my couch.” Your “couch” (couch) is your sofa. It’s a large piece of furniture, usually in your living room, where two or more peop le can sit.

Mona is complaining that Leonardo is apparently sle eping on her couch, meaning he doesn’t have a place to stay. He doesn’t have hi s own apartment, so he’s staying with her temporarily. Of course, one of the  reasons he doesn’t have his own apartment is that he doesn’t have enough money to go and get his own place to live. Mona is hoping that he can be a succ essful artist so that he can make money and stop sleeping on her couch.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: How is the portrait coming along?

Leonardo: I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.

Mona: This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist. If you do a good job with this portrait, you may get other commissions.

Leonardo: It’s all the same to me. I paint them as I see them.

Mona: Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A p ortrait has to be flattering, doesn’t it?

Leonardo: You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked noses, and double chins? No way. That’s what makes each face distinct ive.

This episode is a dialogue between Thomas and Eugen ia about waiting to make an important decision. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Thomas: You’ve hemmed and hawed for weeks. It’s tim e to make a decision.

Eugenia: I know, but I need to sleep on it. This is  a very big decision.

Thomas: You’ve dragged your feet for far too long. Are you having second thoughts?

Eugenia: No, no second thoughts. I just want to be absolutely sure I’m making the right choice. I’m on the fence between two opti ons. We’ll have to live with this decision for years.

Thomas: I thought you’d already made a tentative de cision days ago.

Eugenia: No, no, no. In my mind, the jury is still out.

Thomas: You can’t leave everyone hanging.

Eugenia: I know that, but how can I choose if I’m n ot 100 percent positive about either option.

Thomas: I understand that, but it’s now down to the  wire. You’ve got to bite the bullet and decide.

Eugenia: I know. If only I had a few more days to t hink about it . . .

Thomas: Too late. They’re here.

Eugenia: The painters are here?

Thomas: Yes. So will this be a blue or green house?

Eugenia: How about stripes?

[end of dialogue]

Thomas says to Eugenia, “You’ve hemmed and hawed for weeks.” This somewhat unusual expression, “to hem (hem) and haw (haw),” means to be undecided about making a decision – in fact, to ref use to make a decision or to provide an answer because you’re still thinking abo ut it. You’re still considering your options. Usually when we say someone is “hemmi ng and hawing,” we mean he is being indecisive. He is not making up his min d, and we consider that a bad thing. It’s a criticism of that person.

Thomas says, “It’s time to make a decision.” Eugeni a says, “I know, but I need to sleep on it.” When someone says he’s going to “slee p on it,” or if someone tells you to “sleep on it,” he means to think about somet hing and make a decision tomorrow – to go to bed, if you will, and perhaps t hink about it. I think the idea here is that sometimes if we wait and allow our min d, unconsciously perhaps, to process information or to give our brain time to th ink about something, we will make a better decision. Eugenia says, “This is a ve ry big decision.”

Thomas says, “You’ve dragged your feet for far too long.” “To drag your feet” means to do something very slowly. It means not to do something when you’re supposed to do it, to take much longer than you sho uld take. Thomas says, “Are you having second thoughts?” The term “second thoug hts” means doubts about your decision or doubts that will make you change y our mind about a decision you’ve already made. Eugenia says, “No, no second t houghts. I just want to be absolutely sure I’m making the right choice.” “To b e absolutely sure” about something means you don’t have any doubts. You know  that this is correct. You’re certain that you are right.

Eugenia says, “I’m on the fence between two options .” “To be on the fence” (fence) means to be undecided, to not be sure which  of two options you want. A “fence,” of course, is something that you put up ar ound your property or around something that you don’t want someone to get into, or a place you don’t want

someone to enter. At my house, for example, there i s a fence between all of my neighbors. Interestingly enough, I didn’t put up the fences, so I guess my neighbors don’t want me in their yard more than I d on’t want them in my yard or property.

Anyway, Eugenia is “on the fence between two option s,” or choices. She says, “We’ll have to live with this decision for years.” When someone says, “We have to live with this,” he means we have to be able to tolerate this, or we have to be in this situation. We’re not going to be able to ch ange it. There’s nothing we can do about it.

Thomas says, “I thought you’d already made a tentat ive decision days ago.” “Tentative” (tentative) means not final – temporary . Something that is tentative is something that you’re not certain about. You are sa ying yes to something, but you could change your mind in the future. That’s so mething that is “tentative.” Eugenia says, “No, no, no.” She didn’t make even a tentative decision days ago.

“In my mind,” she says, “the jury is still out.” Th is expression, “the jury (jury) is still out (out),” is used when you mean something is not yet decided, when a decision hasn’t been made either by you, or by perhaps a gro up of people. A “jury” is a group of usually 12 people who decide whether someo ne is guilty or innocent of a crime in a court. “To be out” means to be still t hinking about it. That’s the expression we use when a jury hasn’t yet made its d ecision. We say the jury is still out. The phrase has become more commonly used  to mean any decision that has not yet been made or to refer to a decision tha t has not yet been made.

Thomas says, “You can’t leave everyone hanging.” “T o leave (leave) someone hanging” means not to let someone know the final de cision about something, to make someone wait to find out something important t hat that person wants to know. If you ask a girl to marry you and she says, “Well, let me think about that. Let me sleep on it. I’ll tell you tomorrow,” she is  leaving you hanging. She is not telling you her decision. She’s waiting to give you  her decision, and you are anxious to get her decision. You want to know.

Eugenia says, “I know that,” meaning I know I’m lea ving everyone hanging, “but how can I choose if I’m not 100 percent positive ab out either option.” The word “positive” (positive) here means sure, convinced, p ersuaded that you are correct about something. Thomas says, “I understand that, b ut it’s now down to the wire (wire).” When we say something is “down to the wire ,” we mean it is right before a deadline. There’s no additional time left to make  a decision or to do something.

If you say something is going right down to the wir e, you mean that it isn’t going to be completed until right before the final moment , right before a deadline. Thomas says to Eugenia, “You’ve got to bite the bul let and decide.” The expression “to bite (bite) the bullet (bullet)” mea ns to do something that is very challenging, or very difficult, or perhaps even ver y dangerous, but it’s something you have to do. It might be something that is as si mple as making a difficult decision.

If you’ve asked your girlfriend to marry you and sh e doesn’t really want to, it will be difficult perhaps for her to tell you. But she h as to bite the bullet and tell you. She has to do this difficult, challenging thing bec ause it’s necessary. You need to know. You don’t want to be left hanging. Thomas is telling Eugenia that she has to bite the bullet. Eugenia says, “I know. If only I had a few more days to think about it.”

Thomas says, “Too late. They’re here,” meaning some one has arrived, perhaps someone related to the decision that Eugenia is sup posed to make – and in fact, that’s exactly what is happening here. Eugenia says , “The painters are here?” “Painters” are people who put paint on your house, either on the inside or the outside of your house. Now we know this decision th at Eugenia is supposed to make is related to painting her house. Thomas says,  “Yes. So will this be a blue or green house?” Eugenia needs to decide if the pai nters are going to paint the house blue or green.

Eugenia says, “How about stripes?” “Stripes” (strip es) are parallel lines of different colors. You can think of the animal the z ebra as having stripes, black and white lines on its body. You can have stripes o n a shirt where there’s a line of black and a line of white, or a line of blue and  a line of, I don’t know, grey. What Eugenia is suggesting is that, because she can ’t decide if she wants to paint her house blue or green, she’s going to have blue and green stripes – lines that go up and down the wall, or from side to side,  perhaps.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Thomas: You’ve hemmed and hawed for weeks. It’s tim e to make a decision.

Eugenia: I know, but I need to sleep on it. This is  a very big decision.

Thomas: You’ve dragged your feet for far too long. Are you having second thoughts?

This episode is a dialogue between Lila and George about not talking about certain things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lila: Why aren’t you dating? I have so many friends  who would love to go out with you.

George: Let’s change the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.

Lila: But really, you’re not getting any younger an d . . .

George: Moving on! Have you seen any good movies la tely?

Lila: Listen, all of your friends are settling down  and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely . . .

George: That reminds me, didn’t you say that you we re going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home?

Lila: Forget about my dog. You remember Rachel, don ’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend and she’d be perfect for you.

George: Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother? Wasn ’t she in the hospital?

Lila: If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina? S he has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.

George: And now for something completely different . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?

Lila: I don’t really want to talk about my weight.

George: But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right? I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.

Lila: Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want  to talk about my diet . . .

George: You need to cut out sweets if you want to l ose weight. Are you eating too many sweets?

Lila: That’s none of your business!

George: My sentiments exactly!

[end of dialogue]

Lila begins by asking George, “Why aren’t you datin g?” “To date” (date) means to be involved in a romantic relationship but not yet married – so, to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Lila wants to know why Geo rge isn’t dating. “I have so many friends who would love to go out with you,” Li la says. “To go out with” means to go on a romantic date with someone.

Notice the word “date,” as a noun, means a romantic  evening or afternoon with someone, spending time with someone, going to a mov ie or going to dinner. Those could be “dates.” You might consider a date a  romantic appointment – an appointment with someone who you are romantically i nterested in. “To go out with” someone means to be dating someone. It could also mean simply to go out on a date with someone.

George says, “Let’s change the subject.” “To change  the subject” (subject) means to stop talking about one thing and begin tal king about something else, especially when you don’t want to talk about the fi rst topic. If someone starts talking to you about his financial problems or his health problems and you don’t want to hear about it anymore, you may say, “Well, let’s change the subject.” You have to be careful, of course. You could insult som eone. You could be rude to someone by saying that out loud. You might just wan t to change the subject on your own without actually announcing that.

But George does announce it. He says, “Let’s change  the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.” Lila says, “B ut really, you are not getting any younger and . . .” That expression “you’re not gett ing any younger” would be used in a case where the person is telling someone that he or she may soon be too old to do something, especially in the case of one’s love life. You may say that to someone who you think is getting too old to  get married.

You may also say it about, for example, doing a lot  of traveling. If you think that your health will be bad as you get older – and usua lly it is – you might say, “Well we’re not getting any younger. Let’s take that trip  walking across Europe from Spain to Poland.” I don’t know – whatever thing tha t would involve your health that might not be possible in the future. Lila says , “You’re not getting any younger” to George.

George, however, is trying to change the subject. H e says, “Moving on . . .” “Moving on” is a phrase to indicate that you want t o stop talking about this topic and to talk about something else. George says, “Hav e you seen any good movies lately?” He’s trying to change the topic of conversation by talking about movies. But Lila doesn’t want to change the topic.

She says, “Listen, all of my friends are settling d own and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely.” “To settle (settle)  down” is a two-word phrasal verb that usually means to get married, to find a home, and to start a family. That would normally be the definition of “to settle down .” If a father says to his son, “You need to settle down,” the father is usually re ferring to the fact that the son needs to get married, to buy a house, and to start a family – or at the very least, to move out of his house.

Lila says that she doesn’t want George “to go throu gh life” – that is, to live the rest of his life – “alone and lonely.” “To be alone ” (alone) is to be by yourself, without anyone else. “To be lonely” means to feel s ad because you are by yourself or don’t have any close personal relations hips.

You can be “alone” without being lonely. You can be  by yourself in your house, for example, and not be lonely. You can be “lonely”  and not be alone. If you are with someone but you don’t feel close to that perso n, you could still feel lonely even though you’re not alone, at least in the physi cal sense. There’s someone else with you. Lila is afraid George will be alone and lonely.

George again tries to change the conversation, or t he topic of the conversation. He says, “That reminds me, didn’t you say that you were going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home ?” “That reminds me” is a

phrase we use, once again, to suddenly change topic s. Although it could be that you have suddenly thought of something – you’ve bee n reminded of something that you want to tell the other person. Here, howev er, it’s used by George to try to change the subject of the conversation again.

He asks Leila question about her dog. Again, Lila i sn’t interested in changing the topic. She says, “Forget about my dog. You remember  Rachel, don’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend.” “To break up wit h” someone is to end a romantic relationship with someone. Usually we use that when we’re talking about ending a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, n ot a marriage. If you are ending your marriage, you would probably say you’re gettin g divorced or separated. Lila thinks that her friend Rachel would be perfect for George.

George says, “Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother ? Wasn’t she in the hospital?” Notice again George is trying to change the subject. “Speaking of” is an expression we used to introduce a topic that is related to what the other person said but isn’t exactly the same. You may be talking about, say, going to Paris for a vacation, and someone may have just rea d a book about Paris. He could say to you, “Speaking of Paris, I just read t his wonderful book about Paris.”

George tries to change the subject and talk about R achel’s mother. Lila says, “If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina?” “Type” (t ype) here means the kind of person to whom you are romantically attracted, the kind of person in whom you are interested in. “What about Amina?” Lila says. “ She has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.” The expression “leg man” is an i nformal one referring to a man who might be attracted to women who have long, beau tiful legs.

George says, “And now for something completely diff erent . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?” Here, George is getting impatient with Lila. He’s starting to get perhaps even a litt le angry. However, he uses the phrase “And now for something completely different”  to change the topic of conversation, but also to perhaps make a little jok e.

This expression, “And now for something completely different,” was made famous by a group of comedians from Great Britain c alled Monty Python. Monty Python was a group of comedians back in the 1970s a nd ’80s, and one of the famous phrases in their show in order to move from one part of the show to another was, “And now for something completely diff erent.” It was always something very funny that followed. Here George is not saying anything funny, but he is using that expression as a way of changin g the topic.

He asks Lila a somewhat personal question: “How is your diet coming along?” A “diet” (diet) refers to the kind of food you eat. N ormally we use the word when someone is trying to lose weight. They’re trying to  eat certain kinds of food in order to not be as heavy as they are right now, to weigh less. George asks Lila how her diet “is coming along,” meaning is she bein g successful, is she losing any weight? Leila says, “I don’t really want to tal k about my weight.” Lila considers that a personal topic, just as George con siders his love life a personal topic.

That’s why George is asking the question. He’s trying to get Lila to understand that this topic is personal and he doesn’t want to talk about it. But George then continues in order to get Lila perhaps a little ang ry and perhaps to get back at Lila – to do something bad to her because he feels she did something bad to him by continually asking questions about his love life . George says, “But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right?  I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.” “To shed (shed) pounds” means to lose weight.

Lila now is the one who tries to change the subject . She says, “Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want to talk about my diet.”  “Anyway” is a word that’s very popular in American English. You will hear it a lot  in daily conversation, and it is said usually to change the topic or to talk about s omething new. It’s important to listen to how the word is said. If it’s said at the  beginning of a sentence in the way that Lila says it, “Anyway . . .” (“Anyway . . .”),  usually that means the person wants to change the topic or is now going to talk a bout something different.

George says, “You need to cut out sweets if you wan t to lose weight.” “To cut out” something means to stop using it or stop doing  it – in this case, to stop eating it. That’s true, of course. If you want to l ose weight, it’s a good idea to cut out sweets, to cut out things with a lot of sugar i n them. George says, “Are you eating too many sweets?” “Sweets” refers to anythin g that has a lot of sugar, like candy.

Lila says, “That’s none of your business.” That exp ression, “That’s none of your business,” is used usually in anger when someone is  asking you about something that doesn’t concern them or that you thi nk is too personal to talk about. Lila is now angry at George, and George did this of course on purpose, trying to show Lila how her questions about his lov e life were also too personal to talk about. Lila says, “That’s none of your busines s.”

George says, “My sentiments exactly.” The expressio n “my sentiments (sentiments) exactly” is a phrase used to show that  you agree completely with the other person. You agree completely with what the other person has said.

 George agrees with Lila that asking about her weigh t is none of his business, because he wants Lila now to understand that asking  about his love life is none of her business.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lila: Why aren’t you dating? I have so many friends  who would love to go out with you.

George: Let’s change the subject. Talking about my love life isn’t very interesting.

Lila: But really, you’re not getting any younger an d . . .

George: Moving on! Have you seen any good movies la tely?

Lila: Listen, all of your friends are settling down  and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely . . .

George: That reminds me, didn’t you say that you we re going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home?

Lila: Forget about my dog. You remember Rachel, don ’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend and she’d be perfect for you.

George: Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother? Wasn ’t she in the hospital?

Lila: If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina? S he has great legs and I know you’re a leg man.

George: And now for something completely different . . . How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet?

Lila: I don’t really want to talk about my weight.

George: But I think you’re having trouble shedding those pounds, right? I have lots of suggestions on what you can do.

Lila: Anyway, as I said before, I don’t really want  to talk about my diet . . .

 George: You need to cut out sweets if you want to l ose weight. Are you eating too many sweets?

Lila: That’s none of your business!

George: My sentiments exactly!

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Giancarlo and Alana about someone who works out on the street performin g in order to get money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giancarlo: Whoa, where are you going? I thought we were going to hang out.

Alana: I’m going to work.

Giancarlo: Work? I didn’t know you got a job.

Alana: I’m busking on Main Street.

Giancarlo: You mean you’re panhandling? That’s not working.

Alana: I’m not panhandling. I’m working for tips. I  perform, try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.

Giancarlo: Can you really make money that way?

Alana: You’d be surprised. I got the idea from Dani elle and her friends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines. A fr iend of theirs juggles and does acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.

Giancarlo: And they do all this on the street? Don’ t they get hassled by the cops?

Alana: The cops occasionally tell them to move alon g or tell the crowd to disperse, but if they’re respectful and nobody comp lains, they get left alone. Hey wait, where are you going?

Giancarlo: I’m going with you. I want to give this street performing a try.

Alana: What can you do?

Giancarlo: I’m a man of many talents.

Alana: Are you?

Giancarlo: Don’t look so surprised!

[end of dialogue]

Giancarlo begins our dialogue by using a common wor d in informal English, “Whoa.” “Whoa,” usually spelled (whoa), is a way of  stopping someone or of expressing surprise about something. It’s an old ex pression that we usually associate with someone riding on a horse and wantin g to stop the horse. Someone might say, “Whoa.” Well, nowadays we use it  not to stop horses, but sometimes to stop people from saying something or g oing somewhere. That’s what Giancarlo is doing.

He says, “Whoa, where are you going? I thought we w ere going to hang out.” “To hang (hang) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that me ans to spend time with another person, usually in a lazy sort of way. You may go over to your friend’s house and, I don’t know, have a glass of wine, or a  beer, or a cup of tea, and just relax and talk. You’re going to hang out. “To hang out” usually implies that you’re not going to do anything in particular, anything sp ecial. You’re just going to sort of talk and spend time enjoying yourselves without any specific plans to do anything.

Alana says, however, “I’m going to work.” Giancarlo  says, “Work? I didn’t know you got a job.” Alana says, “I’m busking on Main St reet.” “To busk” (busk) means to play music on a sidewalk or in another public pl ace in the hopes that people will give you money for playing music. We’ve all se en people busking on a city street before or in a subway area or perhaps in a p ark. People play guitars or other musical instruments. Sometimes they sing in t he hopes that people will give them money.

Giancarlo says, “You mean you’re panhandling? That’ s not working.” “To panhandle” (panhandle) means to ask people for mone y, especially if you are sitting on a sidewalk or standing on the side of a road. Another verb meaning the same thing is “to beg” (beg). “To panhandle,” howev er, means specifically to beg in the street or in a public area.

Now, normally we don’t consider people who are busk ing, who are actually doing something like playing music, to be panhandling. “T o panhandle” usually means you’re just asking someone for money. You’re not do ing anything to get the person to give you money – other than, I suppose, a sking in a nice way. You can see panhandlers in Los Angeles very easily by simpl y driving to any of the poorer areas of the city.

Alana says, “I’m not panhandling. I’m working for t ips.” A “tip” (tip) is money that you normally give someone to thank him or her for g ood service or for a job well done. Normally in the United States we tip at a res taurant. We tip the server – the waitress or the waiter. We also tip at the hotel if  someone takes our bags in. We may tip a taxi driver. Americans like to tip a lot more than people in other countries, and in fact, when Americans go to anothe r country, people are sometimes surprised to see them tipping at places t hat the people who live in those countries don’t normally tip.

Alana says she’s just “working for tips,” meaning s he’s just working for people giving her money because she’s doing a good job. “I  perform,” she says, “try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.” “To draw (dra w) a crowd (crowd)” means to attract many people to hear or to see something,  to do something that people will want to come and hear or see. It could be a go od thing. It could be a bad thing. Normally, “to draw a crowd” means to get peo ple to pay attention to you because, perhaps, you’re performing.

“To pass the hat” means to take a hat, the kind of thing you wear on your head, and turn it over and ask people to put money in it.  It’s a common way that street performers try to get people to give them money. Th ey perform and then they take perhaps a hat, or sometimes it’s just a small bowl, and they give it to people and ask them to put money in it. Giancarlo says, “C an you really make money that way?” Alana says, “You’d be surprised,” meanin g “Yes, even though you may not think so.”

She says, “I got the idea from Danielle and her fri ends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines.” “Street theatre” is, just as it sounds, a group of people who perform small parts of a play or small d ramatic performances on a public street – once again, in the hopes usually of  getting tips, of getting people

to give them money. A “comedy routine” (routine) is  when someone stands up and tells jokes or does something funny to get peop le to laugh. Comedy routines usually involve one person telling jokes and making  people laugh.

Alana continues, “A friend of theirs juggles and do es acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.” Alana is mentioning other popul ar forms of street performance – the things that street performers do.  One of them is “to juggle” (juggle). “To juggle” here means to keep several ba lls or other small items in the air by throwing them up into the air and, of course , catching them with your hands and then throwing them up in the air again.

In everyday English, we sometimes use the verb “to juggle” to mean to move things around, especially on your calendar, on your  schedule. Someone may say, “I need to juggle my calendar in order to find  time to meet with you.” I need to rearrange things. I need to move appointments on  my calendar, on my schedule. But the other meaning of the verb “to jug gle” – the, I guess you could say, “original meaning” – is to throw balls up into  the air. I have a nephew who is a very good juggler. Unfortunately, it’s hard to ma ke money juggling. I think he works at a grocery store now.

“To do acrobatics” (acrobatics) means to move your body in unusual ways, often using ropes and swings that are suspended in the ai r. Now, I’m not sure how you would do acrobatics as a street performer. Normally , we associate acrobatics with something like a circus. A “circus” (circus) i s a performance for a large group of people that usually includes tricks with animals  and doing things such as acrobatics where someone walks on a wire that is hi gh up in the air. “Magic tricks” refer to any action that is surprising and entertaining. People often do magic tricks with cards, for example, or they appea r to make things disappear suddenly.

Giancarlo then asks, “And they do all of this on the street? Don’t they get hassled by the cops?” “To get hassled” (hassled) is to get bothered by. The verb “to hassle” means to create problems or trouble for som eone. The “cops” (cops) refers to the police. “Cop” is an informal term for  a police officer – a policeman or a policewoman. Giancarlo wants to know if the stree t performers get “hassled” or bothered by the police.

Alana says, “The cops occasionally tell them to mov e along or tell the crowd to disperse.” “To move along” means to keep walking, t o continue moving in a particular direction. “To disperse” (disperse) mean s to separate and to go in different directions. If a police officer disperses  a crowd, the officer is getting

people to no longer stand together, but to each go in a different direction so that there’s no longer a group of people in a single pla ce.

Alana says, however, if the street performers are “ respectful and nobody complains, they get left alone.” “To be left alone”  means not to be bothered by other people, to be allowed to do what you want to do. Alana then says, “Hey wait, where are you going?” Giancarlo says, “I’m go ing with you. I want to give this street performing a try.” Alana says, “What ca n you do?” Giancarlo says, “I’m a man of many talents.”

The expression “I’m a man of many talents” (talents ) would describe a person who is good at doing many different things. Giancar lo thinks that he has some talent, some ability that he can use to be a street  performer. Alana is surprised. She’s asks, “Are you?” meaning are you really a per son of many talents? Giancarlo says, “Don’t look so surprised,” meaning she shouldn’t be surprised that he has all of these different talents. Of cour se he does. Giancarlo think he’s very talented, apparently.

I have to say I’ve never worked as a street perform er, although you can see street performers here in Los Angeles, even though Los Angeles is famous for people not walking on the streets. They take their cars, of course. Maybe I could try to teach English on the streets of Los Angeles and people will give me tips for that. I should try it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Giancarlo: Whoa, where are you going? I thought we were going to hang out.

Alana: I’m going to work.

Giancarlo: Work? I didn’t know you got a job.

Alana: I’m busking on Main Street.

Giancarlo: You mean you’re panhandling? That’s not working.

Alana: I’m not panhandling. I’m working for tips. I  perform, try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.

Giancarlo: Can you really make money that way?

 Alana: You’d be surprised. I got the idea from Dani elle and her friends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines. A fr iend of theirs juggles and does acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.

Giancarlo: I’m going with you. I want to give this street performing a try.

Alana: What can you do?

Giancarlo: I’m a man of many talents.

Alana: Are you?

Giancarlo: Don’t look so surprised!

# Collecting Debt

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,152 – Collecting Debt.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Ken and Marjorie about getting money back from someone you lent it t o. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ken: Look at this list of customers who still owe u s money. How is this business supposed to survive if we keep extending credit?

Marjorie: We started doing it because some of our b est customers didn’t have ready cash. They’re good for it.

Ken: I know they’ll eventually pay their outstandin g debt, but what are we supposed to do in the meantime? We need that cash t o buy stock.

Marjorie: We can call in the debt and set a deadlin e for repayment. We can give those who are really hard up an extension on a case -by-case basis.

Ken: What if they still don’t pay? We’d have to tur n it over to a collection agency. We’d only get 40 cents on the dollar, but we’ll hav e to close our doors if we don’t collect.

Marjorie: Using a collection agency would be a last  resort. I’ll call each of our major debtors and have a talk with them. I’m sure t hey’ll come through.

Ken: I hope you’re right or we will be the ones ask ing for credit!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Collecting Debt” (debt) – n otice the “b” is silent when we pronounce the word. “Debt” is money that you owe so meone else, money that someone else who gave you to use temporarily, but t hat you have to give back to that person. “To collect debt” means to get the money back from someone who doesn’t want to pay you back or perhaps is slow in paying you back.

Ken begins our dialogue by saying, “Look at this li st of customers who still owe us money.” “To owe” (owe) someone is to be expected  – and in fact, required – to pay someone something or to do something for som eone else. If you owe someone money, you have to give that money back to someone. The idea usually with “owe” is that the other person has don e something for you or, in the case of a debt, given you money.

Ken continues, “How is this business supposed to su rvive if we keep extending credit?” “To extend (extend) credit (credit)” means  to allow someone to buy something now and pay for it later. You’re probably  familiar with the term “credit card.” A “credit card” is an account – an agreement , basically – you have with a bank or a, what we would call, “financial instituti on” that allows you to buy things now and pay for them later. Individual stores can a lso extend credit to their customers. They can allow you to buy things and the n pay for it later.

This store that Ken and Marjorie have extends credi t to its customers, but many of the customers still owe them money. Marjorie say s, “We started doing it” – that is, extending credit – “because some of our best cu stomers didn’t have ready cash.” “Ready (ready) cash (cash)” is money that yo u can spend right now. If a business has ready cash, it can go out and buy some thing and pay for it right away. It has money available. If a business doesn’t  have ready cash, well, then it doesn’t have the money in its bank account to buy t he things it needs to buy.

Marjorie says that the best customers are “good for  it.” The expression “to be good for it” means to be trustworthy, to be reliabl e – most importantly, to be able to pay back money that you owe. If someone says to you, “Give me $10. I’m good for it,” that person is saying to you, “I will  pay you back later. I am a responsible person. I have enough money. I just don ’t have that money with me right now.” That’s sometimes true and sometimes isn ’t. If you’ve ever lent – that is, given – money to someone with the expectation t hat person will give it back to you, you probably know that isn’t always the case w hen someone says he’s good for it. He isn’t always good for it.

Anyway, Ken continues, “I know they’ll eventually” – in time, in the future – “pay their outstanding debt, but what are we supposed to  do in the meantime?” “Outstanding (outstanding) debt” is money that hasn ’t been paid on time. It’s debt

that you owe someone that is, we could say, “overdu e.” It’s late. “In the meantime” means while we are waiting for the people  to pay us back. Ken is asking what he and Marjorie and their business shou ld do while they are waiting for these customers to pay the money they owe back to the business.

Ken explains, “We need that cash,” that money, “to buy stock.” “Stock” (stock) here probably means the things that the store buys.  “Stock” can also refer to partial ownership you have in a company, something you would buy on what we call a “stock market.” But here, “stock” refers to physical goods – things that a store sells. Marjorie says, “We can call in the deb t and set a deadline for payment.” “To call in a debt” means to demand that the person who owes you money pay you immediately or as soon as possible. U sually, “calling in a debt” means requiring someone to pay money before the sch eduled time or before you had originally agreed to have them pay it.

When you borrow a large amount of money from someon e, often you pay that money back in payments, or installments. So, if you  borrow a thousand dollars, you may pay 100 dollars this month, 100 dollars nex t month, 100 dollars a month after that, and so forth. If, however, you miss one  of those payments, you’re late in paying the monthly payment, a bank or a store ma y call in your debt. They may require you to pay it all back now because you missed a payment, or they may set a deadline for repayment. A “deadline” is a  date by which you have to do something.

“Repayment of a debt” means giving all of the money  back to the person who loaned you the money. Marjorie says, “We can give t hose who are really hard up an extension on a case-by-case-basis.” If someone i s “hard up,” that person is in a difficult situation, especially a financial situa tion. Someone who doesn’t have a lot of money, who perhaps lost his job, might be “h ard up,” meaning he doesn’t have very much money. An “extension” (extension) is  additional time – in this case, to pay back your loan.

Sometimes a bank or a business, instead of calling in your debt, will give you more time to pay it. They will give you an extensio n. Marjorie says that she and Ken can do this with their customers on a “case-by- case basis.” A “case-by-case basis” would mean looking at the details of each pe rson or each situation and making a decision on that information, not on just one rule for everyone. Doing anything “case by case” means you don’t apply one r ule or one regulation to everyone. You look at the individual circumstances of each person. Ken says, “What if they still don’t pay? We’d have to turn it  over to a collection agency.”

If someone doesn’t pay you your money, especially i f you’re a business, you may go to another company who will try to get that mone y back for you. That company is called a “collection agency” (agency). N ow, the problem with a collection agency is that the collection agency wil l only give you part of the money that they collect back to you because, of cou rse, the collection agency has to make money. Ken says that they will only get  “40 cents on the dollar.” That means the collection agency will only give the m back 40 percent of every dollar that they get back from the person who owes the company money.

Ken says, “We’ll have to close our doors if we don’ t collect.” The expression “to close your doors” here means to close your business , to go out of business. Marjorie says, “Using a collection agency would be a last resort” (resort). A “last resort” is a choice or option that is the least fav orable, the one that you least want to do, but if you don’t have any other choice, any other option, then you will do that. For example, maybe you’ve lost your job and y ou don’t have any money, and you own a car. You don’t want to sell your car,  but as a last resort – if you really need money to, say, buy food – you may sell your car. That’s an example of a “last resort.”

Marjorie continues, “I’ll call each of our major de btors and have a talk with them.” “Debtors” (debtors) are people who owe you money, p eople who have the debt that they have to pay back to you. Marjorie says, “ I’m sure they’ll,” meaning these debtors, “they’ll come through.” The phrasal verb “ to come through” means to eventually do what you promise to do, to eventually  do what you are expected to do. It means to perform as you are expected to perf orm.

Ken says, “I hope you’re right or we will be the on es asking for credit,” meaning if these debtors don’t come through, Marjorie and Ken will have to go out asking for credit from the businesses they buy things from.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ken: Look at this list of customers who still owe u s money. How is this business supposed to survive if we keep extending credit?

Marjorie: We started doing it because some of our b est customers didn’t have ready cash. They’re good for it.

Ken: I know they’ll eventually pay their outstandin g debt, but what are we supposed to do in the meantime? We need that cash t o buy stock.

 Marjorie: We can call in the debt and set a deadlin e for repayment. We can give those who are really hard up an extension on a case -by-case basis.

Ken: What if they still don’t pay? We’d have to tur n it over to a collection agency. We’d only get 40 cents on the dollar, but we’ll hav e to close our doors if we don’t collect.

Marjorie: Using a collection agency would be a last  resort. I’ll call each of our major debtors and have a talk with them. I’m sure t hey’ll come through.

Ken: I hope you’re right or we will the be ones ask ing for credit!

[start of dialogue]

Marc: Who was that?

Carla: It was your mother – again. She wanted to gi ve me another piece of unsolicited advice about housekeeping. She’s called  five times this week already.

Marc: She’s just trying to be helpful.

Carla: I wish she’d do it without being so critical . I feel like she enjoys finding fault with everything I do.

Marc: She’s a little overeager to help, that’s all.  Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support. She isn’t li ke your mother.

Carla: What do you mean?

Marc: What do I mean?! She’s constantly giving me a dvice on how to be a better husband.

Carla: Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be the best it can be.

Marc: I know, but your mother has a really sharp to ngue and she doesn’t hold back. She butts in whenever I’m trying to do someth ing to tell me how to do it better.

Carla: Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help.

Marc: With her constant sarcastic comments?

Carla: That’s just her sense of humor. She doesn’t mean anything by it. She likes you.

Marc: She has a strange way of showing it.

Carla: All of this talk about mothers-in-law is get ting our blood up. At this rate, we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve received so far.

Marc: Which was?

Carla: Don’t go to bed angry.

Marc: Who’s angry?

[end of dialogue]

Marc begins our dialogue by saying to Carla, “Who w as that?” Carla says, “It was your mother – again.” Apparently, the two of them h ad been talking on the phone. Carla continues, “She wanted to give me another pie ce of unsolicited advice about housekeeping.” Notice the somewhat interestin g phrase – well, interesting to me – “piece (piece) of advice (advice).”

“Advice” is guidance or suggestions that you give s omeone on how to do something. We don’t use the plural of advice. We do n’t say “advices,” but we do say “pieces of advice,” or sometimes “some advice.”  Someone may to you, “Let me give you a piece of advice” – let me give you a suggestion. Here, Carla is talking about “unsolicited advice.” “Unsolicited” c omes from the verb “to solicit” (solicit) which means to ask someone for something.

Someone who comes to your house, knocks on your doo r, and asks for money for some political cause or some other reason is “s oliciting” money from you. You can also “solicit advice.” You can ask other people  to give you suggestions. However, when you don’t ask someone for advice and he gives it to you anyway, that’s what we would call “unsolicited (unsolicited ) advice” – unasked-for advice.

 Most people don’t want unsolicited advice, but appa rently Carla’s mother-in-law likes to give it. The term “mother-in-law” refers n ot to your biological or legal mother, but to the mother of your wife or husband. Carla is getting unsolicited advice from her mother-in-law, from Marc’s (her hus band’s) mother. What is it about? It’s about “housekeeping” (housekeeping) – a ll one word. “Housekeeping” refers to the things you do to keep your house clea n and organized.

There’s a popular magazine called Good Housekeeping . It is a magazine all about keeping your house clean and orderly – and, I  suppose, cooking. I don’t know. I’ve never read it before. It’s a magazine th at traditionally has been very popular among women, especially women who are at ho me cleaning up their houses. That’s changed somewhat over the years. Men  now, I’m told, help in cleaning the house more than they used to. I’m not sure how much that’s really true in most marriages, but there you go.

Carla says, “She’s called five times this week alre ady.” Marc says, “She’s just trying to be helpful.” Carla says, “I wish she’d do  it without being so critical.” “To be critical” (critical) here means to tell someone what she is doing wrong in a negative way. As an adjective, “critical” has a cou ple of different uses. But here, it just means to point out to or to let someone know a bout something he is doing wrong, but in a negative way.

Carla says, “I feel like she,” meaning her mother-i n-law, “enjoys finding fault with everything I do.” “To find fault” (fault) with some one means to identify or to point out problems with something – to find what’s wrong with the situation or the way someone is acting. Marc says, “She’s a little overe ager to help, that’s all.” “To be overeager” (overeager) is to be too enthusiastic ab out something, to be too interested in doing something. The word “eager” des cribes someone who wants to do something. “To be overeager” means to want to  do it a little bit too much.

Marc says that his mother is just overeager to help  poor Carla. He continues, “Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support.” “To be interfering” (interfering) means to become involved  in something that isn’t really your business, to want to get involved in or give a dvice about something that isn’t something you should be concerned with – that “isn’ t your business,” we would say. Marc is saying his mother is not interfering. She just wants to give Carla support. “Support” (support) just means here assist ance or help.

Then Marc says something really interesting. He say s that his mother isn’t like Carla’s mother. Well, now, of course, Carla isn’t g oing to be very happy. Carla says, “What do you mean?” Marc says, “What do I mea n?” He can’t believe that

Carla doesn’t understand what he’s talking about. T hen he goes on to describe what Carla’s mother is like.

He says, “She’s constantly giving me advice on how to be a better husband.” “Constantly” means frequently and repeatedly, conti nuously without stopping, or simply all the time. Marc thinks that his mother-in -law – that is, Carla’s mother – is always giving him advice on how to be a better h usband. Carla says, “Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be t he best it can be.” So now Carla is defending her own mother, saying, “Oh no, my mother isn’t that bad.” Marc says, “I know, but your mother has a really sh arp tongue and she doesn’t hold back.”

“To have a sharp (sharp) tongue” means to be very h onest with someone, but in a way that is very critical, in a way that can ofte n be very mean. “To have a sharp tongue” usually means to be very direct with someon e, but in a way that can seem hurtful, can hurt another person’s feelings. “ To hold back” is a phrasal verb meaning not to do something that you might want to do or you might want to say. “Not to hold back” means that you say what you want . You don’t worry about hurting someone else’s feelings.

Marc describes Carla’s mother as someone who “doesn ’t hold back.” “She butts in whenever I’m trying to do to something to tell m e how to do it better,” says Marc. “To butt (butt) in” is an interesting two-wor d phrasal verb, meaning to interfere. It’s an informal expression, however. “P lease don’t butt in” means “Please don’t interfere.” Please don’t get involved  in this situation, or perhaps simply in this conversation.

It’s a somewhat rude thing to say to someone. You w ouldn’t tell your boss not to butt in. You might tell a friend or a family member  not to butt in. It is, however, a criticism of the person who is doing the interferin g. Carla says, “Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help.” So now Carla is  defending her mother, comparing her to Marc’s mother. Marc says, “With he r constant sarcastic comments?”

“To be sarcastic” (sarcastic) means to use words th at have the opposite meaning of what you are really trying to say in a way that is supposed to be funny. So, for example, someone comes in and they’re very cold and  they want you to turn up the heat. You might say, “Wow, pretty hot out there , huh?” You’re saying something to be funny. You’re saying that it’s hot out there when you know of course it’s actually very cold out there. That’s be ing sarcastic.

Carla says her mother is not sarcastic. She says, “ That’s just her sense of humor,” meaning that’s just her way of being funny.  “She doesn’t mean anything by it.” If you say someone “doesn’t mean (mean) any thing by it,” you mean that the person isn’t trying to be hurtful, isn’t trying  to be mean, isn’t trying to hurt your feelings. Usually we use this phrase when someone s ays something that is hurtful to someone else and you are saying that the  person didn’t have that intention, didn’t have that desire to hurt you.

Carla says that her mother likes Marc. Marc says, “ She has a strange way of showing it.” That expression – he or she “has a str ange way of showing it” – means that you think the person’s actions aren’t ma tching the person’s intentions or desires, or perhaps you’re saying that you don’t  really believe the person doesn’t mean it. You think the person was trying to  be cruel or mean.

If you see someone, for example, I don’t know, alwa ys kicking cats, and that person says, “Oh, actually I love cats,” you might say, “Well you have a strange way of showing it.” If you really love cats, that i s, you wouldn’t kick them all the time. Marc says his mother-in-law has a strange way  of showing that she likes him, because she’s always criticizing him. Carla th en says, “All of this talk about mothers-in-law is getting our blood up.”

“Mothers-in-law” is the plural of “mother-in-law.” You might think you would add the “s” at the end of this term – you might think t he plural would be “mother-in- laws” – and in fact, in conversational English many  people probably would say that, including native speakers. But technically, t he plural of “mother-in-law” is “mothers-in-law.” You put the “s” after the word “m other,” not after the word “law.” Carla says, “All this talk about,” meaning this con versation that we’re having about, “mothers-in-law is getting our blood up.” “T o get your blood up” means to become upset or angry about something.

Carla says, “At this rate,” meaning if we continue doing this, “we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve rece ived so far.” Carla says if we continue talking about our mothers-in-law, we won’t  be able to follow another piece of advice, another suggestion, that we’ve rec eived about married life. Marc says, “Which was?” meaning, “What was that piece of  advice? What was that suggestion?” Carla says, “Don’t go to bed angry.”

This is an old piece of advice for people who are m arried. “Don’t go to bed angry” means resolve your fight or find a solution to the problem you’re having before you go to sleep, otherwise you’ll continue thinking  about it and most likely continue the argument the next day. This is usually  good advice, I think. Sometimes there are problems, of course, that are s mall and that, if you go to

 sleep and wake up the next day, you’ve forgotten ab out or you realize they are no longer very important – certainly not worth figh ting about.

However, there are some problems that you are proba bly best advised to resolve before going to sleep. Here I am giving you advice about your marriage. Well, I have been married for, oh, what, 18 years. So, here  in Los Angeles that’s considered a really long time. I mean, most people here in Los Angeles, especially celebrities, they marry for like, what, five years? three years? two years? – something like that

Back to our dialogue, Carla says, “Don’t go to bed angry.” That’s the piece of advice. Marc says, “Who’s angry?” Perhaps Marc is s aying here that he doesn’t think he has gotten angry over this, or perhaps he’ s agreeing with Carla. He’s saying, “Yeah, I’m not angry if you’re not angry. L et’s forget about it.

Now listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

# Visiting Historic Sites

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,154 – Visiting Historical Sites.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,154. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com, and become a member of this wonde rful podcast. Well, I think it’s wonderful, anyway. When you become a mem ber, you can download our Learning Guide which includes a complete transc ript of everything I say. It also includes a map of where you can find gold here  in California. Yes, it does. Go to our website for more information.

In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mary and Will about going to historical sites. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mary: I think we should call it a day.

Will: I think we still have time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation  and restoration.

Mary: It’s not another old castle, is it?

Will: It’s not any old castle. This one dates back to the 1300s. If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for the last guided tour with a docent w ho’s knowledgeable. And I hope we have time to visit the archives, too.

Mary: Oh no, not the archives.

Will: I wonder if they’re doing reenactments to com memorate any major historical events during our time here?

Mary: If we visit this castle today, we’re not comi ng back. There is a lot to see in this city other than old castles and monuments.

Will: Like what?

Mary: Like art museums and stores. It would also be  nice to relax a little while on vacation.

Will: But what’s art and shopping when you’re in on e of the most ancient cities in the world? And there’s no time to relax. We only ha ve four days here. We have to make the most of it. Hey, where are you going?

Mary: I think it’s time to split up. You go see you r castle and I’ll explore on my own.

Will: But you won’t get the full benefits of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world.

Mary: I think I’ll survive.

[end of dialogue]

Mary begins by saying to Will, “I think we should c all it a day.” The expression “to call it a day” means to stop doing something for th at day, possibly to start again tomorrow. If you’re working late at your office, so meone may say, “Well, it’s time to go home. Let’s call it a day,” meaning let’s say  this is the end. We’re not going to continue working today.

Mary and Will aren’t working, however. They’re out visiting important historic sites. A “site” (site) is a place of interest. A “h istoric (historic) site” is a site that is of importance, of historical importance.

There is a difference between “historic” and “histo rical” (historical). “Historical” is anything from the past. “Historic” is an adjective that describes something that’s very important, that is important in history. Somet hing could be both historic and historical. In fact, most sites, most places that y ou visit that are considered historic are almost by definition historical as wel l. They’re old places.

So, for example, if you go to a famous building tha t was built many years ago, you could call that a “historic site.” You could al so call it a “historical site.” However, many cities have “historical places” – pla ces that are old but aren’t important, that aren’t significant in history, and so they’re not historic sites. It’s a little confusing even to native speakers.

Back to our story, Will says, “I think we still hav e time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation and restoration.” “Preservation” (preservation) is when  you try to keep something in

good condition, something that is old and valuable.  “Restoration” (restoration) is when you take something that has been damaged, that  needs to be fixed, and make it better.

“Preservation” means to keep something in its curre nt condition. “Restoration” means to fix something and make it better. Many old  buildings first need to be “restored” and then “preserved.” Mary says, “It’s n ot another old castle, is it?” A “castle” (castle) is a large building, usually made  of stone, where kings and queens live, or used to live. Many countries, espec ially in Europe, have castles where kings and queens live or used to live many ye ars ago.

It doesn’t sound like Mary wants to go to another c astle. Will says, “It’s not any old castle,” meaning it is a castle but it’s a spec ial one. “This one,” he says, “dates back to the 1300s.” “To date back to” means to have its origins or beginnings in a certain year or period – to be of a  certain age. This castle was built, then, in the 1300s, presumably the 1300s A.D ., or roughly 700, 800 years ago.

Will says, “If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for the last guided tour with a docent who’s knowledgeable.” A “guided tour” is a tour tha t you take of a place or a building led by what we would call a “tour guide,” a person who knows about that place. A “docent” (docent) is a person who works us ually in a museum who knows a lot about the things in that museum. Someti mes there are docents who lead tours, who guide people through a museum on a guided tour, explaining what everything means.

Will says, “I hope we have time to visit the archiv es, too.” “Archives” (archives) usually are large collections of important document s and sometimes small objects. Here in the United States, we have somethi ng called the “National Archives.” It’s a place in Washington D.C., a build ing that has many old important documents and papers. Mary, however, clearly doesn’ t want to go to see the archives. She says, “Oh no, not the archives.” She’ s saying she doesn’t want to go there.

Will says, “I wonder if they’re doing reenactments to commemorate any major historical events during our time here.” A “reenact ment” (reenactment) is a presentation in which people act out something that  happened long ago. Usually this is some historical event that you want to teac h other people about or you want to understand more yourself. You’ll dress up p erhaps in the clothing that people might have worn many years ago and reenact c ertain famous events. This is quite popular in certain areas.

I’m not really someone who loves the whole idea of reenactments, but people do like them. They can certainly teach us about the wa y things were perhaps many years ago. People like to reenact old battles. Peop le like to reenact other famous historical events. It’s sort of like putting on a p lay, but you are acting out or trying to recreate the actions of people many years ago.

“To commemorate” (commemorate) means to remember an d honor someone or something in a special way. Reenactments can commem orate some important events, some historical events. Once again we see t hat word “historical,” meaning old. The word “major” here means very impor tant. Will, then, is wondering if the people at this particular castle w ill be doing any reenactments to commemorate some major historical event while Mary and Will are visiting.

Mary says, “If we visit this castle today, we’re no t coming back. There’s a lot to see in this city other than old castles and monumen ts.” Mary is saying that if they go to this castle today, they are not going to retu rn later in their trip because she wants to see other things. She thinks there is more  to see than “castles and monuments” (monuments).

A “monument” is some object that was built to remem ber and honor important people or events. If you go to the capital of the U nited States – Washington, D.C. – you will see many monuments to important people a nd to important events. Monuments are sometimes built to honor people who h ave died in a war, for example, or to remember certain important events in  a country’s history.

Will says, “Like what?” He’s asking Mary, “What oth er important things are there to see in this city other than castles and monument s?” Mary says, “Like” – or “such as” – “art museums and stores.” “Art museums”  (museums) are places where you of course can see famous pieces of art – paintings and sculptures and that sort of thing. Mary says, “It would also be ni ce to relax a little while on vacation.” Many people go on vacation to see things , but they perhaps don’t relax very much. They don’t just sit and read or talk.

Will says, “But what’s art and shopping when you’re  in one of the most ancient cities in the world?” “Ancient” (ancient) means ver y old. Will is saying that museums and shopping are not very important compare d to the other historical things that you can see in this city. He continues,  “And there’s no time to relax. We only have four days here. We have to make the mo st of it.” “To make the most of” something means to take full advantage of it, to use something the most you can.

Will says, “Hey, where are you going?” Mary says, “ I think it’s time to split up.” “To split (split) up” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to separate – for two people to stop doing something together. Normally w hen we use the verb “to split up” talking about a married couple, we’re talking a bout two people who are no longer going to be together in their marriage – or you could talk about a boyfriend and a girlfriend splitting up.

However, we can also use this when we are traveling , or we are going to a place and each person wants to go to a different part of that place. We could split up. One of us could go shopping and another could go to  monuments, and then we could meet back again later at our hotel. That’s the kind of “splitting up” Mary is talking about, I think. Mary says, “You go see your  castle and I’ll explore on my own.” “To explore” (explore) means to move around a  place without any clear plan, just to see what you will discover, what you will find new.

Will says, “But you won’t be getting the full benef its of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world.” Mary says, “I think I ’ll survive.” She’s not really concerned about it. She says, “I think I’ll survive ,” meaning it’s okay, it’s not that important to me – I’m going to be okay even if I do n’t visit all of the things that you want to visit. Now see, I am a lot like Will. I  like to go and see everything when I go on a vacation, and my wife is a little bi t more like Mary. She’d rather relax more.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mary: I think we should call it a day.

Will: I think we still have time to visit one more historic site and this one is amazing. They’ve done a great job with preservation  and restoration.

Mary: It’s not another old castle, is it?

Will: It’s not any old castle. This one dates back to the 1300s. If we’re lucky, we’ll be in time for the last guided tour with a docent w ho’s knowledgeable. And I hope we have time to visit the archives, too.

Will: But you won’t get the full benefits of being in one of the most ancient cities in the world.

Mary: I think I’ll survive.

Before I call it a day, I want to thank our wonderf ul scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Getting an Online Degree

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,155 – Getting an Online Degree.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,155. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. Why? Well, so you can download the Learning Guide for th is episode. The Learning Guide contains a complete transcript of everything we say, in addition to a complete list of the vocabulary words and a culture  note related to this episode’s topic.

The topic of this episode is getting an online degr ee – getting a college degree from a college on the Internet. Sounds cool. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos: So where are you planning on attending coll ege?

Torrie: I’ve picked Harford University.

Carlos: The only Harford University I’ve heard of i s a degree mill.

Torrie: I’m sure it’s not the same one. The Harford  University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is. The bes t part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus. I can do al l of my coursework online.

Carlos: You want to attend an online university? Th ere are some legitimate ones that offer good distance education, but many have l ow admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education.

Torrie: Not Harford. It’s a good degree-granting in stitution, and they even give you credit for relevant life experience. I won’t ne ed to take very many courses to graduate.

Carlos: That sounds pretty fishy to me.

Torrie: Don’t worry. My transcript and degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional university, without nearly as mu ch work.

 Carlos: That should tell you something. How is thei r job placement rate?

Torrie: I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be a s competitive as any other college graduate.

Carlos: If you say so. What are you doing right now ?

Torrie: I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered relevant life experience. Cool, huh?

Carlos: Yeah, cool.

[end of dialogue]

Carlos says to Torrie, “So where are you planning o n attending college?” “To attend (attend) college” means to be a student at a  college, to go to a university. Torrie says, “I’ve picked Harford University.” “To pick” (pick) means to select, to choose. Carlos says, “The only Harford University I ’ve heard of is a degree mill.” A “degree” (degree) is what you get after you compl ete a course of study at a university. If you study for four years, you usuall y get a bachelor’s degree.

A “degree mill” (mill), however, is actually a busi ness that sells degrees, basically. It looks like a college or university on  the Internet, or in the newspaper, but really it just gives out degrees – pieces of pa per – without you having to do very much. Torrie says, “I’m sure it’s not the same  one.” She’s sure that the Harford University she’s going to study at isn’t a degree mill.

She says, “The Harford University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is.” For a university to be “accredited” (a ccredited) means that some professional organization, some professional associ ation, has examined the college and determined that it meets certain standa rds. Who runs this organization? Well, the colleges that accredit them selves. It’s an interesting system. Anyway, in the United States, most people t ry to get a degree from an accredited university because it’s recognized, righ tly or wrongly, as having a certain level of quality.

Torrie says, “The best part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus.” A “campus” (campus) is the land and the  buildings that a college or university has. Some colleges have more than one ca mpus. They have buildings and land in different parts of the city, or even a state or country. Torrie says that she will not have to “attend,” or go to, “classes o n campus.” She says, “I can do

all of my coursework online.” “Coursework” (coursew ork) – one word – here just means classes, the classes that you are taking. Car los says, “You want to attend an online university?”

An “online university” is a university that offers all or most of its classes over the Internet. This isn’t really a new idea, in the sens e that colleges and universities and schools sometimes offered classes before the In ternet using what we would call “correspondence courses.” They would mail thin gs to you and you would read the books and take the tests and then mail the m back to the university. So, the idea of getting an education without actually g oing to a school building or going on campus isn’t completely new.

Carlos says, “There are some legitimate ones,” mean ing legitimate online universities, “that offer good distance education, but many have low admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education.”  “Legitimate” (legitimate) means real or not false, not fake – “valid,” we mig ht say. A “legitimate university” is one that does what a university is supposed to d o.

“Distance education” is a general term that refers to any kind of education or coursework that is done without you going to a scho ol’s campus. Distance education could involve video education – having vi deo courses, or even seeing a lecture by a professor over the Internet on live video. It could include sending things in the mail. It could include going to a web site. All of these are kinds of distance education. Carlos warns, however, that man y of these online universities have low admissions standards.

“Admissions standards” refers to the requirements t hat you have to have in order to get into a college, university, or school. To ha ve “low admissions standards” means it’s not very difficult to get into the schoo l. Again, people associate the difficulty of getting into a college with the quali ty of that college. I don’t think that’s always the case, but that’s what people think, just  like people think accredited universities are somehow better than unaccredited u niversities. That might be true in general, but it isn’t always true. Anyway, I’m giving my own opinions here. Let’s get back to the story.

Torrie says that Harford it is not one of these uni versities that has low admissions standards. She says, “It’s a good degree-granting i nstitution.” “Degree-granting institutions” are ones that, well, give you a degre e, such as a bachelor’s degree or some other kind of degree. Torrie says, “They ev en give you credit for relevant life experience.”

There are two kinds of classes you can take at a un iversity or college. One is a “credit (credit) class.” The other is a “non-credit  class.” A “credit class” is a class that counts towards, or is included in, the total n umber of classes that you need to take in order to graduate. Most universities ass ign, or give, classes a certain number of credits. You need a certain number of cre dits then to graduate. You could take a class that gives you five credits – us ually that’s a class that meets more or has more class time and is more work than a  class that is only three credits.

To graduate from a university or college in the Uni ted States usually requires I think around 180 credits or so, more or less. The n umber is arbitrary in a way, but the university needs a way of determining how m uch education you are getting, and it needs some sort of standard to dete rmine how much is enough to get a degree. A “non-credit class” is a class that you take but doesn’t count toward your degree – that is, the university won’t include those credits when it counts up the number that you need to graduate, to get a degree.

Torrie says that Harford University gives you credi t for “relevant (relevant) life experience.” “Relevant” means it’s related to or is  significant for some particular purpose or topic. Some colleges and universities wi ll look at your experience – say, if you worked in business for many years – and  give you a certain number of credits for that experience so you don’t have to ta ke classes about things that you already know about.

Now, most colleges and universities don’t do very m uch of this, but there are some that will give you credit for relevant life ex perience if it is connected to the content of a certain class. Torrie says, “I won’t n eed to take very many courses” (or classes) “to graduate,” to finish. Carlos says,  “That sounds pretty fishy (fishy) to me.” Something that is “fishy” is something that  is suspicious, something that doesn’t seem right, something that may be dishonest , even.

Torrie says, however, “Don’t worry. My transcript a nd degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional uni versity, without nearly as much work.” Your “transcript” (transcript) is an officia l list of the classes or courses that you took and the grades that you received in a coll ege or university – or any school, really. “To be indistinguishable,” (indisti nguishable) means to be unable to tell the difference between two different things . “To be indistinguishable” means that you can’t tell the difference. You can’t  say this one is from here and this one is from there.

What Torrie is saying here is that her transcript a nd degree will be the same, or will look the same, as any traditional university’s  transcript and degree, but she

won’t have to do very much work. Carlos then says, “That should tell you something.” That expression, “that should tell you something,” means you should realize that there’s a problem here. You should rea lize that there’s something wrong.

He then asks, “How is their job placement rate?” “J ob placement” refers to getting a job once you finish your degree. So, Carl os is asking how good is this college at getting its graduates, the people who fi nish studying there, a job when they’re done – when they’re done with their educati on. Torrie says, “I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be as competitive as any o ther college graduate.” “To be competitive” (competitive) here means to have the s ame qualifications as someone from a different college.

The word “competitive” can also refer to someone wh o likes to win, who likes to beat other people in games and contests. Here, howe ver, it really just means that you have the same talent or you have the same quali fications as someone else so that you will have as good a chance as another p erson of getting a job. A “graduate” (graduate) is a person who has finished his or her education and has, we would say, “earned (earned) a degree.” You can b e a high school graduate. You can be a college graduate.

Carlos says, “If you say so.” That expression, depe nding on how it’s said, usually indicates that the person doesn’t really believe yo u. “Well, if you say so” – that means I don’t think you’re right, but I’m not going  to argue with you. Carlos continues, “What are you doing right now?” Torrie s ays, “I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered r elevant life experience. Cool, huh?”

So, Torrie says that she’s playing a video game, an d at this online university she’s going to, they will give her credit for that life experience. She’ll get college credit for playing video games. Torrie says, “Cool,  huh?” She thinks it’s okay. She thinks it’s wonderful. Carlos says, “Yeah, cool ,” but he says it in such a way to mean, “Well, unfortunately that means that you r eally are going to a college that is a degree mill” – that this university isn’t  really legitimate.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos: So where are you planning on attending coll ege?

Torrie: I’ve picked Harford University.

 Carlos: The only Harford University I’ve heard of i s a degree mill.

Torrie: I’m sure it’s not the same one. The Harford  University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is. The bes t part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus. I can do al l of my coursework online.

Carlos: You want to attend an online university? Th ere are some legitimate ones that offer good distance education, but many have l ow admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education.

Torrie: Not Harford. It’s a good degree-granting in stitution, and they even give you credit for relevant life experience. I won’t ne ed to take very many courses to graduate.

Carlos: That sounds pretty fishy to me.

Torrie: Don’t worry. My transcript and degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional university, without nearly as mu ch work.

Carlos: That should tell you something. How is thei r job placement rate?

Torrie: I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be a s competitive as any other college graduate.

Carlos: If you say so. What are you doing right now ?

Torrie: I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered relevant life experience. Cool, huh?

Carlos: Yeah, cool.

This episode is a dialogue between Kathy Lee and Ra shed about a factory, a place where things are made, that is not safe. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kathy Lee: You won’t find any problems in your insp ection of our factory.

Rashed: I’m glad to hear that. Where do these stair s lead?

Kathy Lee: It’s just a level for storage. You don’t  need to see that.

Rashed: I need to inspect every part of this factor y. Please step aside.

Kathy Lee: If you insist.

Rashed: You have people working on this floor and it’s not structurally sound, and certainly not intended for heavy manufacturing.  This attic was never meant for industrial use.

Kathy Lee: It’s only temporary . . .

Rashed: There are no fire escapes, fire extinguishe rs, or emergency exits.

Kathy Lee: Well, I . . .

Rashed: None of the workers are wearing protective clothing and I see signs of child labor.

Kathy Lee: No, no, no, I wouldn’t hire anyone under age.

Rashed: I am ordering an immediate shutdown of this  factory due to flagrant violations of building code and labor laws.

Kathy Lee: But you can’t do that! We have orders to  fill.

Rashed: Not when this building is in danger of immi nent collapse.

[end of dialogue]

Kathy Lee begins our dialogue by saying to Rashed, “You won’t find any problems in your inspection of our factory.” Kathy Lee, we understand from the dialogue, is the owner of a “factory” (factory). A factory is usually a place where things are made, physical things are produced. You might have a factory that makes shirts or chairs or automobiles.

An “inspection” (inspection) is when someone comes into a place and looks very carefully to make sure that all of the rules and la ws are being followed. “Inspection” comes from the verb “to inspect,” whic h means to look at something closely, carefully. Rashed says, “I’m glad to hear that,” meaning I’m glad that I will not find any problems in my inspection.

He then asks, “Where do these stairs lead?” We use the verb “lead” (lead) when we are referring to where the stairs end up, where they go. If you ask, “Where does this road lead to?” you’re asking the place to  which the road goes. In this case, Rashed is asking about the stairs: “Where do these stairs lead?” He could have said, “Where do these stairs lead to?” meaning  “Where do they go? What happens if you go up them – where will you be?”

Kathy Lee says, “It’s just a level for storage,” me aning the stairs go up to a floor or level in the building that is used to keep thing s. “Storage” (storage) refers to keeping things that you are going to use later. Kat hy Lee says, “You don’t need to see that.” Rashed says, “I need to inspect every  part of this factory.” Rashed wants to see this place where the stairs lead to.

He then tells Kathy Lee, “Please step aside.” The p hrasal verb “to step aside” means to move out of the way of someone. If you are  standing in front of something or someone and that person wants to get a t that thing, wants to look

at it, and you are in his way, the person may say t o you, “Please step aside” – please move your body so I can go through this area  or see what you are standing in front of.

Kathy Lee responds to Rashed, “If you insist.” The expression “If you insist” means if you say you absolutely have to, or if you are demanding me to do this. Rashed says, “You have people working on this floor  and it’s not structurally sound, and certainly not intended for heavy manufac turing.”

Rashed, we’re guessing, walks up the stairs and see s this level, this floor, and comments that it’s “not structurally sound.” “Struc turally” refers to the building being built in a certain way, constructed or made i n a certain way. “Structurally sound” refers to a building or a house that is buil t well, that is constructed so that it is safe, that is made so that it won’t fall down . If your house is structurally sound, it won’t fall down easily. It is built for n ormal use. It’s safe. Rashed, however, says that Kathy Lee’s factory is not struc turally sound.

The floor that Rashed is on is “not intended for he avy manufacturing.” “Manufacturing” comes from the verb “to manufacture ” (manufacture). “To manufacture” means to make something – again, to ma ke something physical, like a chair or a computer or a piece of clothing. “Manufacturing,” then, refers to the process of making something. “Heavy (heavy) man ufacturing” is making something that is very large, such as perhaps a car , or it could also refer to a large machine that is used to make something, and t he machine itself might be heavy and therefore require a building that is stro ng enough to hold it.

Rashed says, “This attic was never meant for indust rial use.” Rashed and Kathy Lee are apparently in the attic of this building. A n “attic” (attic) is an area just below the roof of a building that is not normally u sed for anything, or perhaps is used only for storage, but in Kathy Lee’s factory it’s being used to make things. That’s why Rashed says, “This attic was never meant  for,” or designed for, “industrial use” – that is, to be used to make thin gs, to be used as part of a factory.

Kathy Lee insists, however, that “It’s only tempora ry,” meaning she’s only using this part of the building for a short period of tim e. Rashed then goes on to explain why this part of her factory is not safe. He says, “There are no fire escapes, fire extinguishers, or emergency exits.” Let’s start wit h that last term, “emergency exits.” An “exit” is a way to get out of the room o r a building. An “emergency exit” is a door or window you use to escape a building th at perhaps has a fire inside of it. It’s a way of getting out of a building or a ho use quickly.

A “fire escape” is a way of getting out of a buildi ng very quickly in case of a fire. Usually we associate fire escapes with ladders that  go on the outside of a building, or metal stairs that are on the outside of a building that you use in order to get out of the building quickly if there’s a fir e.

A “fire extinguisher” (extinguisher) is a small dev ice you use to put out a fire. The phrasal verb “to put out” means, in this case, to s top the fire. “Extinguisher” comes from the verb “to extinguish,” which means ex actly the same thing – to put out a fire, to stop a fire from burning. If you hav e a fire at your house or in the building where you’re working, the firefighters wil l come and try to extinguish the fire. They’ll try to stop the fire from burning, wh ich is basically to get rid of the fire, if you will.

Rashed tells Kathy Lee why this area is not safe. S he says, “Well, I . . .” she’s trying to come up with a reason or an excuse. Rashe d continues to give reasons why Kathy Lee’s factory isn’t safe. He says, “None of the workers are wearing protective clothing and I see signs of child labor. ”

“Protective clothing” is clothing that would preven t you from getting injured. Firefighters wear protective clothing that is meant  to protect them from the heat of a fire. In some factories, the workers have to w ear protective clothing if they are, for example, dealing with chemicals that might  hurt them.

“Child labor” refers to using children, usually def ined in the United States as those under the age of 16, as workers. With some ex ceptions, it’s illegal to have someone work for your, especially in a factory, if they are under a certain age – 16 or 18, depending on the kind of work they are do ing.

Kathy Lee says, “No, no, no, I wouldn’t hire anyone  underage.” “Underage” (underage) means someone who is not old enough lega lly to do a certain activity. So, for drinking alcohol in the United States, “und erage” means under the age of 21. For working at most jobs, “underage” would mean  under the age of 16. Kathy Lee says she would not hire, or employ, anyone unde rage.

Rashed says, “I am ordering an immediate shutdown of this factory due to flagrant violations of building code and labor laws .” Rashed, who we guess works for the government and has the power to inspect fac tories, says he is “ordering an immediate shutdown.” A “shutdown” (shutdown) – o ne word – is when a business stops operating, when a business closes, e specially in the case of the government telling the business it hast to close.

A “flagrant (flagrant) violation” is a violation or  breaking of the law or rule that is obvious, that anyone can see. Rashed says Kathy Lee ’s factory has “flagrant violations of building code and labor laws.” The “b uilding code” (code) refers to the rules that governments have for the way that a house or a building must be built in order to make it safe. “Labor laws” refer to laws that regulate who can work and for how many hours and under what conditio ns.

Kathy Lee says, “But you can’t do that! We have ord ers to fill.” Kathy Lee is telling the inspector that he cannot shut down her factory because the factory has orders to fill. “Orders” refer to requests that com e from people who want to buy things from the factory. “To fill (fill) an order” means to give a company or a person what that company or person requested – to s ell the person what the person wants to buy.

Rashed says that Kathy Lee cannot fill these orders  as long as the building, the factory, “is in danger of imminent collapse.” Somet hing that is “imminent” (imminent) is something that will happen very soon.  Usually we use this adjective when we’re talking about something that is bad or d angerous that is about to happen. A “collapse” (collapse) of the building is when a building falls down or a house crashes down because of some structural probl em or perhaps because of some other accident or maybe even an earthquake.

We have lots of earthquakes here in Southern Califo rnia, where the ground moves. Well, that can cause buildings to collapse. The building basically falls down. Rashed is saying that Kathy Lee’s factory “is  in danger of imminent collapse,” meaning it might fall down quite soon, a nd that’s why Rashed wants to close the factory.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kathy Lee: You won’t find any problems in your insp ection of our factory.

Rashed: I’m glad to hear that. Where do these stair s lead?

Kathy Lee: It’s just a level for storage. You don’t  need to see that.

Rashed: I need to inspect every part of this factor y. Please step aside.

Kathy Lee: If you insist.

Kathy Lee: But you can’t do that! We have orders to  fill.

Rashed: Not when this building is in danger of immi nent collapse.

All of our dialogues are structurally sound – or at  least grammatically sound, we hope – thanks to the wonderful work of our wonderfu l scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Venus and Milo about describing people who don’t have any clothes on. Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Venus: Kids, cover your eyes! Don’t look at that. I  didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you bring us here?

Milo: I brought you here to see this celebration of  the beauty of the human form.

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on  that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on d isplay for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked!

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate t he artists’ creations?

Venus: I’m not one of those people who go to nude b eaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibited. This is  shameful!

Milo: This isn’t a nude beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.

Venus: I don’t call this art. I call it pornography . I’m taking my kids out of here. Oh my God, there are full frontals wherever you look! Kids, keep your eyes covered. We’re leaving.

Milo: All right, but I was just trying to open your  kids’ eyes to art.

 Venus: You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!

[end of dialogue]

Venus begins our dialogue by saying to her children , “Kids, cover your eyes.” The expression “to cover your eyes” means to put your hands in front of your eyes so that you don’t see something bad. If you’re  watching a movie and there’s a very violent scene, a part with a lot of violence , and you know that your husband or wife doesn’t like that kind of violence,  you may say, “Cover your eyes,” meaning don’t look at the screen, or put you r hands in front of your eyes so that you don’t see this.

Venus is telling her children to cover their eyes. “Don’t look at that,” she says. “I didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you  bring us here?” “Nudity” (nudity) comes from the word “nude” (nude). “To be nude” means not to have any clothing on. We might also say “to be naked” (naked ) – without clothing. Venus is asking Milo why he brought them to this place. We l ater learn it’s a museum that has nudity.

Milo says, “I brought you here to see this celebrat ion of the beauty of the human form.” The “human form” means the shape and appeara nce of the human body. Venus, however, doesn’t think this is a good thing.  She says, “This is obscene.” “Obscene” (obscene) is something that is considered  very vulgar or inappropriate, usually something related to nudity or sexual activity. Something that is obscene is considered to be unacceptable by  the social standards of the community or of the culture.

Certain things might be considered obscene in one c ulture or in one historical period that are not considered obscene in a differe nt one. Venus, however, thinks that the nudity she is seeing is obscene. She says,  “Look at the bare breasts on that one and the one over there is topless.” “Breas ts” (breasts) are two things that women have on their chest, in the top front of  their body, that are used to among other things feed children, young babies. “Ba re (bare) breasts” are breasts that are not covered with any kind of cloth ing.

“Topless” (topless) refers usually to a woman, but it could be a man who doesn’t have a shirt on, who doesn’t have anything that is covering the top part of his or her body. If a woman is “topless,” then you will se e her “bare breasts.” A great deal of Western art, especially during the Renaissa nce period in Europe, features the human body that is naked. Similarly, you find a rt from the ancient world –

ancient Greece and Rome – where the human body was shown without any clothing.

Venus doesn’t like this. She then says, “That man’s  private parts are on display for everyone to see.” Venus is, we think, pointing at a statue. It’s not a real man. It’s a statue of a man, a representation of a man. She points out that the man’s “private parts are on display.” A person’s “private  parts” are those parts of the body that we normally cover with clothing.

For both a man and a woman, that would include the parts around your waist – that is, where your legs meet the lower part of you r body. For a woman, “private parts” usually also include her breasts. These are things that are typically covered with clothing in most Western countries, an d certainly in most places in the United States. To have something “on display” ( display) is to have something so that everyone can see it. It’s in a place where everyone can see it. Venus is saying that this statue is showing a man’s private parts so that everyone can see them.

“Most of these,” Venus continues, “are butt naked.”  Your “butt” (butt) is your rear, what you sit on. It’s a somewhat informal word, but  a perfectly good word to use in any circumstance. In more formal English, we mig ht refer to it as a person’s “behind” (behind), or if you want to be really soph isticated, you might use a word that comes from the French, your “derriere.” My fat her would sometimes use that word instead of “butt,” but most people say “but.” Notice there are two “t”s in this “butt.”

“Butt naked” refers to someone who doesn’t have any  clothes on, and so you can see the persons butt. It’s usually a general term, however, to refer to someone who doesn’t have clothes on any part of his body. M ilo says, “Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate the artist’s creations?” “ To see past” (past) something means to ignore or not be bothered by some negative  part of an experience or something that you’re reading or looking at in orde r to appreciate or enjoy the better things, the good things, the good qualities of something.

Venus says, “I’m not one of those people who go to nude beaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibite d. This is shameful!” Let’s start with the term “nude beaches.” A “beach” (beach) is an area next to an ocean or possibly a lake that people go and sit on in order to get a suntan. A “nude beach” is a beach where you can sit without wearing any cl othing. This is not very common in the U.S. There are, I guess, places like this. I myself have never been to one, but a nude beach would be a beach where it isn’t illegal to be naked.

Normally, if you walk around a town or a city witho ut any clothes on, you might get arrested for not having any clothes on, but on a “nude beach” usually you are safe to do that. In other words, it’s not against t he law to be nude in public as it is in most places in the U.S. Venus says she’s “not on e of those people,” meaning she’s not the kind of person who goes to nude beach es and runs around in her birthday suit. “To run around” means simply to walk  around, I think, in this case, or to move around.

Your “birthday suit” refers to you not wearing any clothing. When we say someone has their “birthday suit” (suit) on, we mea n the person doesn’t have any clothing on, just as the day that you were born was , when you came out of your mother’s body without any clothing on. You didn’t h ave any clothing on when you were born, and so we call that condition of not hav ing any clothes on your “birthday suit.” A “suit” normally is, of course, a  set of clothing that you have on – pants and a shirt, for example, perhaps even a tie if you’re a man.

Venus says she doesn’t run around in her birthday s uit “uninhibited” (uninhibited). “To be inhibited” means to not want to reveal yourself or to be shy, to be unwilling to do certain things, perhaps because you’re embarr assed by them or you don’t think they’re appropriate. The opposite of that is “to be uninhibited.” To be uninhibited means not to be embarrassed by anything , just to do whatever you want, not to think that it’s inappropriate – most i mportantly, not to care about what other people think of your actions.

Venus thinks that these nude statues, this art that  she’s seeing is “shameful” (shameful). Something that is “shameful” is somethi ng that causes you feelings of embarrassment – when you think that it’s wrong, when you think that it’s inappropriate. Milo says, however, “This isn’t a nu de beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.”

It occurs to me now that perhaps Venus is a teacher  rather than a parent, but in any case, Milo is telling her that she and the chil dren are in the museum in order to appreciate great art, some of the best art in hi story. Venus says, “I don’t call this art. I call it pornography.” “Pornography” (po rnography) refers to images that are intended to sexually excite the person who sees  them or watches them. A shorter form of the word “pornography” is “porn” (p orn). Venus thinks this art that shows the naked or nude human form is pornography.

She says, “I’m taking my kids out of here.” “Oh my God,” she says, “there are full frontals wherever you look.” “Full (full) frontals (frontals)” refers to the fronts of people’s bodies which are naked, basically people w ho don’t have any clothes

on. The term “frontal” comes from another expressio n, “frontal nudity,” which describes seeing the front of someone’s body withou t any clothing on.

Milo says, “All right, but I was just trying to ope n your kids’ eyes to art.” “To open someone’s eyes to” something means to get him to un derstand or appreciate something he hasn’t seen or understood before. Venu s says, “You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!” “To slam” (slam) something means to close something, but with a lot of force. If you “slam the door,” you close it using a lot of force so that it makes a lo ud noise. Venus is saying that she’s closing her children’s eyes because she doesn ’t want them to see what she thinks is pornographic.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Venus: Kids, cover your eyes! Don’t look at that. I  didn’t know there would be nudity here. Why did you bring us here?

Milo: I brought you here to see this celebration of  the beauty of the human form.

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on  that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on d isplay for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked!

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate t he artists’ creations?

Venus: I’m not one of those people who go to nude b eaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibited. This is  shameful!

Milo: This isn’t a nude beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history.

Venus: I don’t call this art. I call it pornography . I’m taking my kids out of here. Oh my God, there are full frontals wherever you look! Kids, keep your eyes covered. We’re leaving.

Milo: All right, but I was just trying to open your  kids’ eyes to art.

Venus: You’ve opened their eyes all right, and I’m slamming them shut!

[end of dialogue]

 There’s nothing obscene, we hope, with any of our d ialogues. Thanks to our wonderful dialogue writer – our scriptwriter, Dr. L ucy Tse – for her wonderful work.

This episode is a dialogue between Boris and Kay ab out being in cold weather and complaining about it – telling people what you don’t like about it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exe rcise you’ll get all winter.

Kay: My face hurts and I can’t stop shivering.

Boris: If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up.

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my core body temperatur e dipping. I feel hypothermia coming on.

Boris: Don’t be silly. You’re dressed in layers, wi th fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from the cold. The worst you’re going to get are dry skin and cracked lips.

Kay: Then why do I feel pins and needles in my hand s and numbness in my feet?

Boris: Maybe you’re just getting used to the cold. You’ll feel warmer in a minute.

Kay: But what if they’re signs of frostbite? I thin k I’ll turn back before I freeze.

Boris: And miss out on these awe-inspiring winter v iews?

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a blazing fire!

 [end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Boris telling Kay, “Come  on, keep climbing!” “To climb” (climb) means to go up, usually a hill or a mountain. Boris says, “This is the best exercise you’ll get all winter.” Boris is telling Kay that climbing – whatever it is they’re climbing, a hill or a rock o r a mountain – is going to be good exercise. Kay says, “My face hurts and I can’t stop  shivering.”

Kay says her “face hurts.” It’s painful probably be cause it’s so cold out. She says she “can’t stop shivering.” “To shiver” (shiver) me ans to have your body move – or we would say “shake” (shake) – uncontrollably be cause you’re so cold. If you’re really, really cold, sometimes your arms wil l start moving, your body will start moving, because you are so cold. That’s calle d “to shiver.”

Boris says, “If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up .” “To pick up the pace” (pace) is an expression meaning to increase your speed, es pecially when you are talking about walking – to walk more quickly. Boris  is telling Kay that if she moves more quickly, she will warm up. She won’t be as col d. “To warm up” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to become warmer.

Kay doesn’t believe it. She says, “I doubt it,” mea ning I don’t think so. “I can feel my core body temperature dipping.” Your “core (core ) body temperature” refers to how warm or cold the center of your body is. You ’re not talking about how cold your arms and legs are, but rather the middle part of your body, what we might call your “torso” (torso). “To dip” (dip) means to go down. So, if your core body temperature is “dipping,” the temperature is decrea sing. We might also say it’s “dropping.”

Kay says, “I feel hypothermia coming on.” “Hypother mia” (hypothermia) is when your body is too cold. It gets so cold that you cou ld even die. It’s a condition of the body having too low of a temperature. “To come on” here is another way of saying it is beginning to happen. Kay says she feel s “hypothermia coming on.” Boris says, “Don’t be silly,” meaning you’re wrong;  you’re exaggerating; you’re not being rational.

He says, “You’re dressed in layers with fabric that  wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from the cold.” If you  are “dressed in layers” (layers), you have different pieces of clothing on,  one over the other, so that you keep warmer. If you live in a cold area, you know t hat a good way of keeping warm is to put different pieces of clothing on your  body – one shirt, and then

another shirt over that, and then a sweater over th at. This is called “dressing in layers.” A “layer” is a different section of someth ing, one on top of another.

“To wick (wick) moisture (moisture)” means for a pi ece of clothing to take the wetness – that’s what “moisture” is – from your ski n and move it away from your skin in order to keep your skin dry. It’s not a ver y common expression, “to wick moisture.” I don’t think I’ve ever used it before i n my life, but it is the technical way of describing what clothing can do to keep your  skin warm. Certain kinds of clothing, certain kinds of “fabric” (fabric) – the material from which clothing is made – can help remove the moisture from your skin,  preventing you from getting even colder.

“To insulate” (insulate) something is to prevent so mething from getting too hot or too cold. In many houses in the United States, ther e is insulation in the walls. It’s a material that helps the house retain or keep the heat inside. In houses in the northern part of the United States this is very com mon, to have your house insulated. Well, your body can also be insulated in  such a way that the warmth of your body, the heat of your body, doesn’t escape an d therefore make you cold.

That’s what Boris means when he says that the cloth ing that Kay is wearing is “insulating” her body from the cold. It’s also keep ing the cold air out so that the body doesn’t become cold. “The worst you’re going t o get,” Boris explains, “are dry skin and cracked lips.” “Dry skin” is when your  skin doesn’t have enough moisture, that can sometimes cause you to have itch y skin – where you want to scratch your skin because it is so dry. It can also  cause what is called “peeling” (peeling), where the outer layer of your skin begin s to come off.

“Cracked (cracked) lips (lips)” is when your lips, which are the two things that are the outer part of your mouth, become so dry that th ey have little tears in them. The skin might even begin to “bleed” (bleed), which  is when blood comes out. To have “cracked lips” is to have lips that are so dry  that the skin begins to crack. It begins to open up, and that’s what causes the bleed ing and can also be quite painful. If you live in a cold area, you often have  to put something on your lips so that they don’t become too dry. The thing you put o n your lips to prevent them from becoming too dry is called “lip balm” (balm).

Anyway, Boris is telling Kay that her situation is not going to become serious in terms of getting too cold. Kay says, “Then why do I  feel pins and needles in my hands and numbness in my feet?” The expression “pin s (pins) and needles (needles)” refers to a sensation or a feeling that part of your skin is perhaps being pierced or stuck with a pin or a needle. A “p in” is a small, thin piece of metal that can be used for a number of different pu rposes. The important thing to

know is that both “pins” and “needles” have sharp p oints that, if you were to put it against your skin, would hurt.

Kay is describing a feeling of pain that she is get ting on her skin – or if not pain, at least a weird feeling on her skin because she’s getting cold. She also describes “numbness” (numbness) in her feet. If you  are “numb” in some part of your body, you are unable to feel any heat, cold, o r touch to that part of your body, typically. We would say you “lack any sensati on” in that part of your body; your body isn’t able to feel the things it would no rmally feel, such as heat and cold.

If you go to the dentist, the dentist will usually put something into your mouth. The dentist will inject something with a needle int o your mouth in order to make part of your mouth “numb” (numb) so that you won’t feel the dentist doing his or her work. Kay thinks that she has numbness in her f eet due to the cold. Boris says, “Maybe you’re just getting used to the cold,”  meaning maybe you just need a little more time and your body will adapt to the cold. “You’ll feel warmer in a minute,” he says.

Kay responds, “But what if they’re signs of frostbi te?” She’s worried that this numbness, for example, is a sign of a very serious medical condition called “frostbite” (frostbite). “Frostbite” is a medical c ondition where part of your skin begins to die, in effect, because it’s too cold. It  can be very dangerous. Kay says, “I think I’ll turn back before I freeze.” “To turn back” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means to return to the place you left, to  go back to where you came from.

Kay wants to go back to where she came from before she freezes. “To freeze” (freeze) means for a liquid to become a solid. Howe ver, Kay isn’t referring to the more scientific definition of freeze. She just mean s getting very, very cold. You may walk into a room that is very cold and say, “It ’s freezing in here.” You don’t mean it’s actually below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, whi ch is the freezing point for water. You mean it’s really, really cold, and that’ s what Kay means here.

Boris says, “And miss out on these awe-inspiring wi nter views?” He’s saying that if Kay returns, she will “miss out” – that is, she will not be able to benefit from or appreciate these “awe-inspiring winter views.” A “v iew” (view) refers to something you can see, usually something that’s nice to look at. If you have a hotel room near the ocean, you may have an ocean view. You may  be able to see the ocean from your window, the window of your hotel room.

Boris is saying to Kay that if she returns back hom e, or back to wherever she came from, she will miss out on some “awe-inspiring  (awe-inspiring) winter views.” Something that is “awe-inspiring” is someth ing that is very beautiful, something that is very powerful that affects you in  a good way. “Awe-inspiring” could be used to describe a view. It could be used to describe a piece of art or a piece of music, even.

Kay says, “I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a bl azing fire.” “Blazing” (blazing) means burning brightly and warmly. If you have a fi re that you make from, say, several pieces of wood, and the fire is large or st rong, it might be described as being “blazing” – burning brightly and creating a l ot of heat so that if you stand near it, you will become warm. Kay says she would r ather be in front of a fire than in front of the “awe-inspiring winter views” t hat Boris wants her to see. I think if I were Kay, I would do the same thing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exe rcise you’ll get all winter.

Kay: My face hurts and I can’t stop shivering.

Boris: If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up.

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my core body temperatur e dipping. I feel hypothermia coming on.

Boris: Don’t be silly. You’re dressed in layers, wi th fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from the cold. The worst you’re going to get are dry skin and cracked lips.

Kay: Then why do I feel pins and needles in my hand s and numbness in my feet?

Kay: But what if they’re signs of frostbite? I thin k I’ll turn back before I freeze.

Boris: And miss out on these awe-inspiring winter v iews?

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a blazing fire!

I think the dialogues written by our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse, are awe-inspiring sometimes. Thanks, Lucy, for your wonderful work.

This episode is a dialogue between Vera and Wang ab out how we describe the way the clothing fits – how it looks and feels on y ou. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vera: How do these pants look on me?

Wang: Uh, aren’t they a little too tight? They look  like they’re cutting off circulation in your legs.

Vera: They’re a little snug, but they show off my c urves, don’t they?

Wang: I suggest going up a size. Something a little  less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.

Vera: I’m not going for comfort. I’m going for styl e.

Wang: Here, try these pants. They’re looser and off er more room.

Vera: These don’t show my shape at all. They’re not  in the least flattering.

Wang: But you can move in them without busting a se am.

Vera: You’re missing the point. I want to look good  in these pants no matter what.

Wang: Spoken like a true slave to fashion!

[end of dialogue]

 Vera asks her friend Wang, “How do these pants look  on me?” Vera wants to know how a pair of pants look on her, meaning do th ey look good, do they make her look fat, and so on. Wang says, “Uh, aren’t the y a little too tight?” If we say a pair of pants or a shirt is “tight” (tight), we mea n it’s a little too small for you. It fits against your skin so much so that it looks small on  you.

Wang says, “They look like they’re cutting off circ ulation in your legs.” Wang is telling Vera that the pants she has on look like th ey’re “cutting off circulation” in her legs. “To cut off circulation” means not to all ow blood to flow or go freely into a certain part of your body. Wang is saying that th ese pants are so tight on Vera’s legs that the blood isn’t able to go there c orrectly. He probably doesn’t mean that literally, but he’s trying to emphasize t o Vera that they’re too small for her.

Vera doesn’t agree exactly. She say, “They’re a lit tle snug, but they show off my curves, don’t they?” If something is “snug” (snug),  it’s a little too small – perhaps not so small that you can’t wear it, but a little t ight. Vera recognizes that the pants are a little too small for her, but she says they’r e just a little snug. However, she likes them because they “show off her curves.” “To show something off” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to reveal, to let other p eople see easily.

Your “curves” (curves) are, in this case, the parts  of one’s body, especially a woman’s body, that seem to go out from the straight  line of a body – so basically, a woman’s rear end, her butt, and her breasts. Thos e would be her “curves.” Vera wants “to show off” her curves – to let other people see them more easily. Wang says, “I suggest going up a size.” “To go up a  size” (size) means to use or try a piece of clothing that is a little bigger, th at is one size bigger.

In the United States, as in most countries, clothin g is given a number. That number is related to how big a piece of clothing is . This can be very confusing because different countries use different numbering  systems for shoes, for pants, for shirts, and so forth. That’s why if you’re goin g to a different country and you want to buy some clothes, it’s usually a good idea to try them on first. “To try a piece of clothing on” means to put it on your body and see if you like it.

Wang suggests that Vera go up a size in the pants, meaning she try a pair of pants that is a little bigger. He says, “Something a little less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.” Something that is “formfitti ng” is something that is a little snug, perhaps even a little tight on someone – that  fits against his or her skin with very little extra room in between the piece of  clothing and the skin.

Vera says, “I’m not going for comfort. I’m going for style.” The phrasal verb “to go for” something here means to try to have or do some thing, to have a particular goal or intention. If someone says, “I’m going for comfort,” he means that’s what he wants from this piece of clothing. He wants it t o be comfortable. Vera isn’t going for comfort. She’s going for style – that is,  she wants the piece of clothing to look good on her.

Wang says, “Here, try these pants. They’re looser a nd offer more room.” For a pair of pants to be “looser” (looser) means that it  is a little bigger and not as tight as something else. It has more room, that is to say , between the actual cloth or fabric of the pair of pants and your skin. Wang say s that these pants he is asking Vera to try on, “offer more room.” “Room” here mean s space. A piece of clothing that offers more room means you can move around in it more easily.

Vera says, “These don’t show my shape at all.” Vera  is concerned that the pants Wang suggests to her won’t let people see the shape  of her body, and that’s what she wants in order to be stylish. She says, “T hey’re not in the least flattering.” Something that is “flattering” (flatte ring) is something that makes one appear more beautiful or more attractive. The verb “to flatter” means to say something to someone in order for that person to li ke you – to say something complimentary about him or her, to say something ni ce about him or her.

If you say to a woman, “You look very beautiful tod ay,” you perhaps are trying to flatter her. You’re trying to say something nice to  her so that she will think that you are nice or that you like her, perhaps. “Flatte ring” can be used to describe a piece of clothing that looks good on someone – that  makes that person look more attractive or more beautiful. So, you can see the connection between the verb “to flatter” and the adjective “flattering.”

Vera says that the pair of pants that Wang gave her  are “not in the least flattering,” or are not flattering in the least. Wh en we say something is “not flattering in the least” or “not in the least of an ything,” we mean not at all, not even a little bit. If someone says, “Are you hungry ?” and you say, “I’m not hungry in the least” (or “I’m not in the least hungry”), y ou mean that you aren’t even a little bit hungry. You are completely without hunge r.

If you are asked, “Are you concerned that your son isn’t doing well in school?” You might say, “Oh I’m not in the least concerned a bout my son.” Actually, you probably wouldn’t say that. You would be concerned about your son if he isn’t doing well in school, or your daughter, but “to be not in the least” something means that you don’t have that quality even in a sm all amount.

Am I worried that the Dodgers are not going to win the World Championship of baseball, what we call the World Series (which of c ourse is not the world championship but the championship of the U.S.), I w ould say, “No, I’m not in the least worried.” I know that they are going to win t he World Series this year. Depending on when you listen to this episode, you m ay see that I was right or wrong.

Back to our story – Vera says that the pair of pant s are “not in the least flattering.” Wang says, “But you can move in them w ithout busting a seam.” “To bust” (bust) means to break something open. A “seam ” (seam) is where two parts of a piece of clothing come together. A seam is usu ally “sewn” (sewn) with a machine nowadays, although in the old days, it was done by hand. You would attach two pieces of fabric, two pieces of material , together in order to make a piece of clothing. The line where those two pieces of material come together is called the “seam.”

“To bust a seam” would mean basically to wear a pie ce of clothing that is so small that if you moved in it, you would rip it or bust the seam. There’s another expression, “to be bursting at the seams.” “To be b ursting at the seams” means that you are so excited about something that you ca n barely contain yourself – that you are really excited. “I’m bursting at the s eams to tell you some news that I have, some good news.”

But here, Wang is using the expression “busting a s eam” to mean that the clothing is so tight on Vera that she won’t be able  to move in it without basically ripping the clothing, making the seams come apart. Vera says, “You’re missing the point,” meaning you don’t understand why I’m bu ying these pants. “I want to look good in these pants no matter what.”

The expression “no matter (matter) what” means rega rdless of what might happen, even if the consequences are bad, I still want to do this. “I want to go to the opera tonight no matter what” – even if I have to pay a thousand dollars, even if I have to walk to the Disney Concert Hall in dow ntown Los Angeles. I want to go no matter what.

When someone says they want to do something “no mat ter what,” he or she means it doesn’t matter what the consequences will be, what the bad effects might be – he or she wants to do this thing. Wang s ays, “Spoken like a true slave to fashion.” The phrase “spoken like” is used to us ually make fun of someone or to characterize someone’s personality or attitude. It’s used to say that this person is typical of a certain kind of person. Let me give  you another example.

If I say to you, “I need to go to the grocery store . It’s only two blocks away, but I’m going to drive in my car. I’m not going to walk .” You might say to me, “Spoken like a true resident of Los Angeles” – an “Angeleno ,” we call ourselves. “Spoken like a true Angeleno.” That means that’s exactly the way someone from Los Angeles thinks – that even if I have to go two bloc ks, I’m going to use my car rather than walk there.

Now this isn’t exactly true for me. I would walk to  a store two blocks away. Three blocks? Meh, I would probably drive. It’s embarrass ing, but I will tell you a story. There’s a big shopping center about a mile from my house, and on one end of the center is a grocery store, and on the other end  of the center is a pharmacy, a drugstore, and the two stores are about maybe a blo ck from each other.

Once, when I was feeling really lazy, I drove to the grocery store, parked in front of the grocery store, got my food, got into my car,  drove to the other end of the parking lot, walked in the pharmacy, bought my drug s, and came out. Instead of walking down to the pharmacy, buying my drugs, and then walking back to my car parked in front of the grocery store, I drove b etween the two stores. Now that’s a terrible thing to do, really, but that’s w hat people do in Los Angeles, and I am a terrible person. I keep telling you that. You don’t believe me. Now you know it’s true.

Anyway, let’s finish our story here. Wang says to V era, “Spoken like a true slave to fashion.” The expression a “slave (slave) to fas hion (fashion)” refers to a person who is always concerned that what he or she is wearing is the latest look, the latest clothing, the most current fashion – wha t everyone else is wearing nowadays. That would be someone who is a “slave to fashion.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vera: How do these pants look on me?

Wang: Uh, aren’t they a little too tight? They look  like they’re cutting off circulation in your legs.

Vera: They’re a little snug, but they show off my c urves, don’t they?

Wang: I suggest going up a size. Something a little  less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.

 Vera: I’m not going for comfort. I’m going for styl e.

Wang: Here, try these pants. They’re looser and off er more room.

Vera: These don’t show my shape at all. They’re not  in the least flattering.

Wang: But you can move in them without busting a se am.

Vera: You’re missing the point. I want to look good  in these pants no matter what.

Wang: Spoken like a true slave to fashion!

This episode is a dialogue between Tanya and James about making mistakes at work and getting in trouble. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tania: What time is your meeting with Ted?

James: It’s at 3:00. Why?

Tania: You don’t seem worried. If I were being accu sed of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.

James: It was a minor offense. I’m sure I’ll just g et a slap on the wrist.

Tania: I heard about it and it didn’t sound that mi nor.

James: People blow things out of proportion. It’s n ot like I’ll be up for dismissal or anything.

Tania: I hope not, but you might get a written repr imand placed in your personnel file. That could affect your chances for a raise or  promotion.

James: I don’t have much of a chance of getting eit her one, quite frankly, so why sweat it? I’ll deal with whatever punishment I get.

Tania: I’m glad that’s your attitude.

James: What I say is: Don’t do the crime if you can ’t do the time!

[end of dialogue]

Tanya begins by asking James a question: “What time  is your meeting with Ted?” James says, “It’s at 3:00. Why?” Tanya says, “You don’t seem worried.” You don’t seem concerned. “If I were being accused of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.” Tanya says th at if she were “accused of misconduct,” she’d be “on edge.”

“To be accused” (accused) means that someone has sa id that you have done something wrong or perhaps even something illegal. If someone accuses you of stealing something, that person is saying that you stole something. You did something, in this case, wrong and possibly illegal .

James is being accused of misconduct. “Misconduct” (misconduct) is breaking the rules, doing something wrong. “Misconduct” is a  more formal term for doing something wrong or behaving in such a way that your  company or organization thinks that you need some sort of punishment. Usual ly that’s what it means. The word “conduct” simply means behavior. It could be g ood behavior or bad behavior. “Misconduct” is always bad behavior or po or behavior, or breaking the rules and regulations.

Tanya says that James is “up for disciplinary actio n.” “To be up for” something means to be considered for something. It could be a  good thing or it could be a bad thing. If someone says, “I’m up for a promotion ” (promotion), meaning getting a better job in your company, that’s a good thing. “To be up for disciplinary action,” however, is certainly a bad thing. “Discip linary” (disciplinary) comes from the word “discipline.” “To discipline” someone is t o punish someone, to do something bad to someone who has done something wro ng.

A parent may discipline his child for doing somethi ng wrong by, oh, I don’t know, sending the child to his room or telling the child he has to sit in the corner and not play with the other kids for 10 minutes or five min utes. If your child does something wrong, you may say to the child, “You’re not going to get any dessert tonight, or any sweets tonight. That’s my way of di sciplining you.” “Disciplinary,” then, refers to some sort of punishment.

“Disciplinary action” would be something the, in th is case, company will do to you for breaking the rules. Tanya says that James is “u p for disciplinary action.” If she

were in that condition or that situation, she would  be “on edge.” “To be on edge” (edge) means to be worried about something, to be n ervous about something. You could also be on edge if you were perhaps uneas y. You’re not sure what’s going to happen. “I’m waiting to get the results of  my exam. I’m on edge.” I’m uneasy.

James, however, doesn’t seem to be worried. He says , “It was a minor (minor) offense (offense).” Something that is “minor” is no t important, not significant – “small,” we might say. The opposite of “minor” is “ major” (major). Of course, “minor” and “major” are also musical terms. But her e they refer to the importance or significance of something. An “offense” is a vio lation, when someone breaks a rule or breaks a law. James says that whatever he d id was a “minor offense.”

He says, “I’m sure I’ll just get a slap on the wris t.” A “slap (slap) on the wrist (wrist)” is a very mild, almost insignificant punis hment. It’s when you don’t get disciplined very much. It’s when the punishment you  get doesn’t seem very significant or very serious. If you kill someone, i f you murder someone, and then the police tell you, “Well, you’re only going to ha ve to pay a $10 fine for that,” that would be a slap on the wrist. That’s not normally g oing to happen in most places.

Your “wrist” (wrist) is part of your body. It’s whe re your hand meets the rest of your arm. A “slap” (slap) is a hit. “To slap” usual ly means to take your hand and hit someone on his or her face, but “slap” could al so mean a very light or not very painful hit with your hand. A “slap on the wrist,” then, would not be a very painful experience, and therefore not a very significant pu nishment. I’m not saying that you should slap anyone hard in order to discipline them. It’s an old expression that means a very, what we might describe as, “mild ” or even “minor” punishment.

Tanya says, “I heard about it,” meaning I heard abo ut what you did, James. “And it didn’t sound that minor.” Noticed the use of the  word “that” here to mean “very.” It didn’t sound very minor, meaning it didn’t seem to her that whatever James did was a minor offense. James continues, however: “Peo ple blow things out of proportion.” The expression “to blow (blow) things out of proportion (proportion)” means to treat a situation or to consider a situati on as if it were much more important and serious than it actually is.

If you come home and your wife asks you if you brou ght the groceries home – the food – home from the store and you say, “Oh no,  I forgot.” If then your wife takes out a gun and shoots you, that would probably  be blowing things out of proportion. Your wife is getting more angry then sh e really should. So, “Honey,

I’m sorry I forgot the groceries today – don’t shoo t me.” That’s blowing things out of proportion.

James says that his situation has been blown out of  proportion, apparently. He says, “It’s not like I’d be up for dismissal or any thing.” James is saying that he’s not going to be dismissed. “To be up for dismissal”  (dismissal) means that you are going to be fired. You are going to lose your j ob. That’s the meaning of the verb, in this case, “to dismiss.” Tanya says, “I ho pe not, but you might get a written reprimand placed in your personnel file.” A  “reprimand” (reprimand) is a written notification that you did something wrong. Usually a reprimand says something about what will happen if you do that sam e thing again.

So, a “written reprimand” would be something that a  company would put in your “personnel file.” “Personnel” (personnel) – notice there are two “n”s in “personnel” – refers to people who work for an organization. your “personnel file” (file) would be information about you that, at least in some com panies, is still kept in a physical thing, called a “file” or a “folder,” in w hich you put pieces of paper that are related to each other. Nowadays, of course, the  word “file” usually refers to an electronic file, a document.

Tanya reminds James that this written reprimand tha t would be put or placed in his personnel file could affect his chances “for a raise or promotion.” A “raise” (raise) is when you get more money for the work you  do at your company. A “promotion,” as we mentioned previously, is when yo u get a better job at your company.

James says, “I don’t have much of a chance of getti ng either one, quite frankly.” The expression “quite (quite) frankly (frankly)” me ans I’m telling you this in a very honest way; I’m telling you in a very direct way. W hen someone uses the phrase “quite frankly,” he’s saying, “I’m being honest wit h you.” I’m being 100 percent honest with you even though it might be embarrassin g or even though it might perhaps anger you. In this case, though, James is s aying that quite honestly, “quite frankly,” he doesn’t think he’s going to get  a raise or a promotion, “so why sweat it?”

“To sweat (sweat) it” means to be very nervous or w orried about something. If someone says, “Don’t sweat it,” he’s saying don’t w orry about it. It’s no big deal. James says, “I’ll deal with whatever punishment I g et.” A “punishment” is, of course, something done to you when you do something  wrong. It’s a negative consequence of your actions, we might say. Tanya sa ys, “I’m glad that’s your attitude,” meaning I’m glad that that is your viewp oint – the way you think about things.

 James ends the dialogue by saying, “What I say is,”  meaning my opinion is, “Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.” That ’s an old expression: “Don’t do,” or commit, “the crime” – that is, don’t break the l aw – “if you can’t do the time.” “To do the time” here means to take the punishment,  usually to be placed in a jail, to be put in a prison. If someone says he’s “ doing time,” that person means he’s in prison. Or if a person said, “Yeah, I did t ime back in the 1980s,” she’s telling you she was in prison back in the 1980s.

“Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time. Don’t  do it.” That was a song. Actually, it was from a television show called Bere tta . “Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time” was part of the theme song, the song that they would play at the beginning of the show. I believe it was written  by the great Sammy Davis Jr. Interestingly, the actor who played the character B eretta in the TV show himself was accused of murder. He, however, was not found g uilty, though many people said that he did do the crime. He just didn’t do the time. Who knows?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tania: What time is your meeting with Ted?

James: It’s at 3:00. Why?

Tania: You don’t seem worried. If I were being accu sed of misconduct and up for disciplinary action, I’d be on edge.

James: It was a minor offense. I’m sure I’ll just g et a slap on the wrist.

Tania: I heard about it and it didn’t sound that mi nor.

James: People blow things out of proportion. It’s n ot like I’ll be up for dismissal or anything.

Tania: I hope not, but you might get a written repr imand placed in your personnel file. That could affect your chances for a raise or  promotion.

James: I don’t have much of a chance of getting eit her one, quite frankly, so why sweat it? I’ll deal with whatever punishment I get.

Tania: I’m glad that’s your attitude.

 James: What I say is: Don’t do the crime if you can ’t do the time!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,161 – Travelling by Light Rail.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Jean and Gordon about using a light rail train. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jean: Look out!

Gordon: Don’t worry. That’s just a light rail train . The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.

Jean: Phew! For a second there I thought we were go ing to collide with it.

Gordon: Didn’t you see the operator seated at the f ront of the train? She watches out for other drivers.

Jean: I didn’t know they have operators. I thought they were automatic.

Gordon: No, they’re not like some forms of rapid tr ansit.

Jean: I see now that they ride on tracks and are po wered by overhead electric lines.

Gordon: That’s right.

Jean: I’d like to give light rail a try.

Gordon: Really? Well, there’s no time like the pres ent. I’ll take you to the nearest stop. There’s the platform over there.

 Jean: But I thought you agreed to give me a ride in to the city.

Gordon: And deprive you of a new travel experience?  Never!

[end of dialogue]

Jean begins our dialogue by yelling to Gordon, spea king very loudly to Gordon, “Look out!” “Look out” is an expression we use to t ell someone they need to be careful – to warn someone that something perhaps bad is about to happen to them. In particular, something is about to hit them  or they are about to accidentally hit something and injure or hurt thems elves. Another way of saying “Look out!” is “Watch out!”

If you were standing next to a bookcase, a large pi ece of furniture that holds books, and the bookcase was about to fall on you, s omeone might yell, “Look out!” or “Watch out!” The person is warning you to look around and notice the danger that might affect you, and of course, to do something about it – to get out of the way, in this case. Gordon says to Jean, “Don ’t worry. That’s just a light rail train.” It appears that Gordon and Jean are driving  and Jean is telling Gordon, who is the person driving, to look out. Why? Becaus e apparently the car is near a light rail train.

A “light rail train” is a train that usually goes i nside of a city, from one part of a city to another. It might also go from two different cit ies. Light rail trains are not trains that go for long distances like, say, between Los A ngeles and New York City or between Paris and London. A light rail train  would  be a smaller train that’s usually used for what we might call “commuting.” He re in Southern California, we have a light rail train that goes from different su burbs of Los Angeles into the downtown area.

Gordon says, “The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.” “Street traffic” refers to cars, trucks, and other vehicles that travel on the streets and roads. Buses, motorcycles, vans – these are all  examples of vehicles that use the streets. In some cities, the light rail tra in goes on the same street as the cars travel. In many cases, however, the light rail  train is on a different part of the street. The cars aren’t driving exactly on the same  part of the street as the light rail train, except perhaps when the street crosses another street.

Jean says, “Phew!” This is a word that we use to ex press relief, or perhaps when we’re really tired, we might go “Phew!” People pron ounce it differently, I think. It’s spelled (phew). Jean continues, “For a second there ,” meaning for a very brief

moment or brief time, “I thought we were going to c ollide with it.” “To collide (collide) with” something means to run into somethi ng. “The two cars collided with each other.” They hit each other. They ran int o each other.

Gordon says, “Didn’t you see the operator seated at  the front of the train? She watches out for other drivers.” The “operator” (ope rator) is the person who, in this case, drives a large vehicle or a train. The operat or of the train could also be called the “conductor.” The word “operator” is a mo re general term to describe a person who operates or controls a vehicle or machin e. “Conductor” specifically refers to the operator, if you will, of a train.

Gordon says the operator of this train “watches out  for other drivers.” “To watch out for” something means to look for possible probl ems so that you can avoid them. Someone may say to you, “If you visit Los Ang eles, watch out for crazy drivers” – people who don’t know how to drive and c ould cause an accident. I mentioned earlier that you can use “Watch out!” in some of the same situations as you would use “Look out!” You might also say “lo ok out for” in similar situations as you would use “to watch out for.” “Lo ok out for the dangerous drivers in Los Angeles, especially me.”

Jean says, “I didn’t know they have operators. I th ought they were automatic.” Something that is “automatic” (automatic) is someth ing that is controlled by a machine – often nowadays by a computer – not a “rea l live human being,” we might say. Jean is surprised that the train has the  actual human being operating it, running it, conducting it. Gordon says, “No, th ey’re not like some forms of rapid transit.”

“Transit” (transit) refers to moving something or a  group of people from one place to another. “Rapid” (rapid) means fast or quick. So , “rapid transit” refers to something that can move people from one place to an other quickly. Usually “rapid transit” is a kind of public transportation.  “Public transportation” refers to transportation or modes of transportation that anyo ne can use as long as he pays money. This would include buses, subways, light rai l trains, and so forth.

Jean says, “I see now that they” – meaning the trai ns, the light rail trains – “ride on tracks and are powered by overhead electric line s.” The “tracks” (tracks) of a train are the long metal pieces that the train sits  on and moves across. “To be powered by” something means to get the energy in or der to operate. Something that is powered by gasoline is something that gets its energy from some form of gasoline, usually gasoline that goes into a motor o r an engine.

The trains are powered by “overhead electric lines. ” Something that is “overhead” (overhead) is something that is above you, somethin g that is literally “over your head.” “Electric lines” are cables or long thin pie ces of metal that carry electricity. “Overhead electric lines” would be cables or lines that go above the train but that are connected to the train and allow the train to m ove. The electric lines carry electricity that power the train, that give it ener gy to move.

Gordon says, “That’s right,” meaning yes, Jean is c orrect. Jean says, “I’d like to give light rail a try.” “To give something a try” ( try) means to do something, usually something you have not done before. Gordon says, “Really? Well, there’s no time like the present.” The expression “There’s no time like the present” means that we should do something right away. We sh ouldn’t wait and do it later. He says, “I’ll take you to the nearest stop. There’ s a platform over there.”

A “stop” (stop) here refers to a station, or a plac e where a train or a bus regularly stops to let the people on the train or bus off and  to allow different people to come on. In most cities, there are “bus stops” ever y couple of blocks where the bus stops to allow you to get on and off. A “platfo rm” (platform) is a place where you get on a train. Specifically, “platforms” are u sed for trains, typically. We don’t talk about a “bus platform.” A “platform” is an are a that is usually above ground and higher than the ground around it. It allows you  to get on and off a train.

Jean says, “But I thought you agreed to give me a r ide into the city.” Jean is wondering why Gordon is telling her to get out of t he car and get on one of these light rail trains when he promised to give Jean a r ide into the city. Jean and Gordon are obviously not in the city but are going in that direction.

Gordon says, “And deprive you of a new travel exper ience? Never!” “To deprive” (deprive) someone of something is to not allow some one to have something or do something. Gordon doesn’t want to deprive, or pr event, Jean from having this new travel experience. We’re not so sure if Jean he rself wants that new travel experience right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jean: Look out!

Gordon: Don’t worry. That’s just a light rail train . The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.

Jean: Phew! For a second there I thought we were go ing to collide with it.

Gordon: Didn’t you see the operator seated at the f ront of the train? She watches out for other drivers.

# Staying in an Inexpensive Hotel

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,162 – Staying in an Inexpensive Hotel.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,162. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Oh, yeah.

This episode is a dialogue between Suzanna and Kenj i about staying in a hotel that doesn’t cost very much. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleaba g motel in the seedy part of town?

Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommo dations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Reme mber?

Suzanna: I remember, but I didn’t bargain for somep lace as run-down as this. Look at the peeling wallpaper and moldy bathroom.

Kenji: It’s pretty bad, isn’t it? Look on the brigh t side. At least it’s not rat-infested.

Suzanna: That’s small comfort. Well, I think I’ll t ake a short nap before we go out for dinner. Uh!

Kenji: What’s the matter?

Suzanna: This comforter is filthy. I doubt housekee ping has changed it in months!

Kenji: Let’s get out of here and go get a drink. Th at should cheer us up.

Suzanna: Good idea. If I have more than one, maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.

 Kenji: Given the state of this room, we might need an entire pitcher!

[end of dialogue]

Suzanna begins our dialogue by asking Kenji, “Remin d me why we’re staying in this fleabag motel in the seedy part of town?” When  someone begins a question with “Remind me why” or “Remind me,” usually the pe rson is not very happy with the situation, or perhaps confused about something – something he doesn’t understand. For example, if you go to a movie and it’s a really bad movie, a movie recommended by your friend, you may say to your friend, “Remind me why we’re watching this stupid movie?” You’re criti cizing, of course, your friend’s choice.

That’s what Suzanna is doing here. She’s in effect criticizing Kenji for having them stay in this “fleabag motel.” A “motel” (motel ) is like a hotel but it’s usually smaller and less expensive. The “m,” I believe, ori ginally comes from “motor,” meaning it was a hotel that was designed for people  who were and are traveling by car. Usually a motel has doors that face out or that look out onto the parking lot where the cars are.

The term “fleabag” (fleabag) describes a hotel or p erhaps another temporary housing place that is dirty, old, and usually falli ng apart, often with not very clean living conditions. The rooms aren’t clean. The hote l itself isn’t very clean. The word “fleabag” comes from “flea” (flea). A flea is a small animal that you usually associate with dogs, for example, or other small an imals. Technically, a “flea” is a small insect that feeds off of the blood of another  animal. If your dog has fleas, your dog will often scratch at the fleas or the fle a bites.

“Fleabag,” then, would describe a very dirty, not v ery nice hotel or motel. Suzanne is wondering why they are staying “in this fleabag motel in the seedy (seedy) part of town.” The word “seedy” refers to a n area, perhaps even a person who is somewhat suspicious, possibly even criminal.  It could also describe a place that is dirty or disgusting or unsafe. If you  say, “That’s a seedy character,” you mean that’s a person whom you can’t really trus t, a person who might even be a criminal.

To describe a hotel as “seedy” would usually indica te that it’s not a very clean hotel, possibly even a hotel that is used for crimi nal activity, including prostitution. Kenji says, “We agreed that we would skimp on the a ccommodations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out . Remember?” “To skimp (skimp) on” something is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to spend a very small

amount on something – much less than most people wo uld normally spend – in order to save money, although you could also skimp on something because you don’t want very much of it.

There’s an adjective “skimpy” (skimpy) which descri bes someone who isn’t wearing very much clothing. If a woman is wearing a  “skimpy outfit” (outfit), she’s not wearing very much clothing. A “bikini,” for exa mple, might be described as being skimpy. But here, the phrasal verb “to skimp on” means not spending very much money. Kenji says that he and Suzanna agreed t hey would not spend very much money on accommodations. “Accommodations” (acc ommodations) refers to a place where you stay when you are traveling, s uch as a hotel.

Another word for “accommodations” is “lodging” (lod ging). Although, you don’t hear that word as much anymore unless you’re talkin g about your expenses for your company. If you travel, your company might ask  you to give them receipts for your lodging, for your accommodations, basicall y for your hotel room. Kenji says the agreement that he and Suzanna had was “to skimp on accommodations” so they could spend more money on “ eating out” – that is, on eating in a restaurant.

Suzanna says she remembers this, “But,” she says, “ I didn’t bargain for someplace as run-down as this.” If someone says, “I  didn’t bargain (bargain) for “something, she means she didn’t anticipate or inte nd to do something. Usually when you say, “I didn’t bargain for this,” you mean  you are surprised in a negative way because you didn’t expect this or you didn’t think you agreed to do this.

“To be run-down” means to be in very poor condition  – to be very old, to be perhaps falling apart. You could describe a buildin g as being “run-down.” “This apartment building is run-down.” It’s not taken care of very well. There are things that are broken. It might be a little dirty. That w ould all be part of this description of being “run-down.”

Suzanna says, “Look at the peeling wallpaper and mo ldy bathroom.” “Wallpaper” is paper, that usually has a certain color or decor ation, that you put up on a wall instead of painting it. That’s why the term “wallpa per” makes so much sense. It’s paper that you put on the wall. If wallpaper isn’t put down properly, or if it’s very old, it will start to “peel” (peel). The verb “to p eel” here means for the wallpaper to begin to come off the wall, especially from the top  of the wall.

“To peel” can also mean to remove the outer layer of something. You could peel a potato. You could take the outer layer, what we w ould call the “skin” (skin) of

the potato, off. So, “peeling wallpaper” is wallpap er that is falling off. A “moldy (moldy) bathroom” is one in which there is fungus –  something that is caused usually by moisture. You don’t want mold in your ba throom. It can cause a lot of problems, including health problems.

Kenji said, “It’s pretty bad isn’t it,” meaning thi s motel is pretty bad. “Look on the bright side,” he says. This expression “to look on the bright (bright) side” is used when you are asking someone to find something good or positive in a bad situation. It’s another way of saying “be optimisti c,” “be positive,” “look for the good things here.” He says, “At least it’s not rat- infested.”

The positive thing that Kenji points out about this  motel is that it doesn’t have rats – small little animals that you don’t really want t o see in your house or hotel room. The term “rat-infested” (infested) just means  full of rats, or lots of rats. Suzanna says, “That’s small comfort,” meaning it’s a good thing but not very much.

“Well,” she says, “I think I’ll take a short nap” –  a short time to sleep – “before we go out for dinner.” “Uh!” she says. Kenji says, “Wh at’s the matter?” meaning what’s wrong. Suzanna says, “This comforter is filt hy.” A “comforter” (comforter) is a thick, warm blanket that you put on a bed. If something is “filthy” (filthy) it’s very dirty, it’s very unclean.

Suzanna continues, “I doubt housekeeping has change d it in months!” In a hotel or a motel, there usually is a group of people who go around cleaning the rooms, usually every day. That group of people is called, collectively, “housekeeping” (housekeeping). These are the people – I’ll have to  say, in most hotels in the United States, usually women – who go around and cl ean the rooms or who are supposed to clean the rooms. Suzanne is complaining  that the comforter probably has not been “changed” or cleaned in many months.

Kenji says, “Let’s get out of here and go get a dri nk,” meaning an alcoholic drink. “That should cheer us up,” he says. “To cheer someo ne up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make you happy. Suzanna say s, “Good idea,” meaning yes, that is a good idea. “If I have more than one, ” meaning more than one drink, “maybe I won’t care so much where we’re staying.”

Kenji says, “Given the state of this room, we might  need an entire pitcher.” “Given” here means considering or in reference to. “The state of this room” refers to the condition of this room. Kenji is saying, the n, that because of how bad this room is, “we might need an entire pitcher” (pitcher ). A “pitcher” is a large container. Here Kenji is referring to a large pitch er of beer, I’m guessing.

 Kenji is saying that because the room is in such bad condition, he and Suzanna might need to drink a whole pitcher of beer in orde r to feel better, in order to be cheered up enough so that they can continue staying  in this fleabag motel.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanna: Remind me why we’re staying in this fleaba g motel in the seedy part of town?

Kenji: We agreed that we would skimp on the accommo dations so we could spend more money on activities and eating out. Reme mber?

# Types of Religious Leaders

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,163 – Types of Religious Leaders.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,163. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Mary and Alexei about types of religious leaders. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mary: I feel like an idiot!

Alexei: Why? What happened?

Mary: I just called the bishop over there “Pope.”

Alexei: That’s not so bad. You gave him a promotion . At least you didn’t call him “Rabbi.”

Mary: Don’t laugh! When I agreed to work at this in terfaith conference, I didn’t know I’d need a crash course in identifying religio us leaders from their dress.

Alexei: It can’t be that hard. That man over there is clearly a cardinal, and the woman next to him is probably a minister by the loo k of her clerical collar.

Mary: What about the man in robes over there?

Alexei: He’s probably a lama or a guru. He’s defini tely not an imam, but I’m not entirely sure how I would address him.

Mary: See what I mean? I keep saying the wrong thin g.

Alexei: These religious leaders don’t expect laypeo ple like you and me to know as much as they do about religious dress.

Mary: That’s what you think! I called that man over  there “Preacher” and he gave me a dirty look.

Alexei: No wonder. He’s the caterer.

[end of dialogue]

Mary begins our dialogue by saying, “I feel like an  idiot!” An “idiot” (idiot) is a person who isn’t very smart, who is not very intell igent. Alexei says, “Why? What happened?” Mary says, “I just called the bishop ove r there ‘Pope.’” Our dialogue is about types or names of religious leaders. Mary mentions two names, “bishop” (bishop) and “pope” (pope).

A “bishop” is a senior leader, we might say, in a C hristian church. There are different Christian “congregations,” we might call them, or groups that use this term “bishop” for their leaders. The Catholic Churc h, or the Roman Catholic Church, uses this term “bishop” for its leaders.

The Catholic Church also has another term – as do s ome other Christian churches, but it’s usually associated with the Cath olic Church – and that is “pope.” The “pope” is the leader of the Catholic Ch urch who lives in Vatican City, which is located inside the country of Italy. There  are, I should add, a few other Christian churches which also use the term “pope.”

In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope is himself a  bishop, but is considered the highest leader of the church. Alexei says, “Tha t’s not so bad. You gave him a promotion.” A “promotion” is when you get a better job in a company. Alexei is making a little joke here. He’s saying that by call ing this bishop the “pope,” he’s giving the bishop, in essence, a more important job  than he already has.

Alexei says. “At least you didn’t call him ‘Rabbi.’ ” A “rabbi” (rabbi) is a leader of a Jewish synagogue. A “rabbi” may also be a religious  scholar of the religion of Judaism. Mary says, “Don’t laugh. When I agreed to work at this interfaith conference, I didn’t know I’d need a crash course i n identifying religious leaders from their dress.” An “interfaith (interfaith) conf erence,” or meeting, would be something involving two or more religions, especial ly groups or meetings that involve different religious leaders talking about i ssues and ideas that they may have in common or that they may differ about.

Mary says that she didn’t know she’d need a “crash course.” A “crash (crash) course” is a very short, usually what we might desc ribe as “intense,” period of studying about something or learning about somethin g, usually because you need to know something right away in order to do so mething or to perform some action.

For example, if you get a new computer and the comp uter has software that you have never used before and you have to use it tomor row to do something, you may decide to take a “crash course” in how to use it. You may decide to spend many hours tonight studying on how to use this part icular software. That would be an example of a “crash course” – when you have t o learn something very quickly.

“Religious leaders” refer to leaders of particular religions. “Religions” are systems of belief that usually talk about the meaning of li fe and the origins of life. I think most people know what religion is. Mary says that s he didn’t know she needed to take a crash course on identifying, or figuring out , religious leaders from their dress. “From their dress” means how they are dresse d. She means that she doesn’t know how to identify religious leaders just  looking at the way they are dressed because different religious leaders often d ress differently.

Alexei said, “It can’t be that hard,” meaning it is n’t really that difficult. “That man over there,” he says, “is clearly a cardinal, and t he woman next to him is probably a minister by the look of her clerical collar.” A “ cardinal” (cardinal) is a religious leader, once again in the Catholic Church. A cardin al usually dresses somewhat differently than another kind of religious leader, a bishop. In fact, most cardinals, though not all, are bishops themselves. Cardinals a re religious leaders in the Catholic Church that, among other things, participa te in electing the next pope, or leader of the Catholic Church.

A “minister” (minister) is a leader of a Christian church. It could be any kind of Christian church, not necessarily a Catholic church . It could be a Baptist church or a Presbyterian church or any one of a variety of  Christian groups. In some Christian groups or churches, ministers wear what’s  called a “clerical collar.” The word “clerical” (clerical) comes from the word “cle ric.” A “cleric” is a religious leader.

“Collar” (collar) here refers to something worn aro und the neck. The word “collar” usually refers to jewelry or something worn around a person’s neck. You can think of your dog having a collar – that’s somethin g the goes around the dog’s neck that usually you connect something to in order  to control the dog – a long rope or a long piece of material called a “leash” ( leash).

 Well, we’re not talking about dog collars here. We’ re talking about religious collars, which are usually pieces of white material  – stiff, thick, white material that goes around the neck of a religious leader, a Chris tian religious leader. Many ministers often wear a black shirt with this white collar that goes around the neck. Mary says, “What about that man in robes over there ?” A “robe” (robe) is something you wear over your body, that is very lon g. It’s almost like a very large dress. It could be worn by a man or a woman.

Alexei says that the man that Mary is pointing at i s probably a lama or a guru. A “lama” (lama) is a Tibetan or Buddhist monk, or a t itle for a religious leader of Buddhism. You can think perhaps of the Dalai Lama, from Tibet. A “guru” (guru) is a spiritual teacher usually associated with Hind uism or Buddhism, or possibly a leader in the “Sikh” (Sikh) religion. Alexei says t he man that Mary is pointing at is probably a lama or a guru.

He says, “He’s definitely not an imam, but I’m not entirely sure how I would address him.” An “imam” (imam) is a Muslim religiou s leader, a leader of a group that believes in Islam (Islam). Alexei says he’s “n ot entirely sure,” meaning he’s not exactly sure, “how I would address him.” “To ad dress” (address) someone is to speak to someone in a particular way, especially  using some sort of title, some sort of name for that person.

For example, if you meet the president of the Unite d States, you would probably say, “It’s nice to meet you, Mr. President.” That’s  how we would address the president of the United States. If you were talking  to the pope of the Catholic Church, you would say, “Your Holiness” or “Holy Fat her.” Those are terms of address – how you would talk to that person when yo u first talk to that person. If you are in a courtroom and you are talking to a jud ge, the proper form of address is probably “Your Honor” (honor). That’s how you wo uld address, or talk to, that person.

Alexei is not sure how to address some of the relig ious leaders. Mary says, “See what I mean? I keep saying the wrong thing.” Alexei  says, “These religious leaders don’t expect laypeople like you and me to k now as much as they do about religious dress.” A “lay (lay) person” is som eone who is not a religious leader or who doesn’t have a position of religious leadership within a church or religious group.

Another term for “laypeople” would be “laymen,” alt hough it’s become more popular now to say “laypeople,” but it means the sa me thing usually, unless someone is distinguishing between a man and a woman , in which case you may

say “layman” or “laywoman.” Alexei is basically tel ling Mary not to worry too much – that these religious leaders don’t expect he r to know who’s who, if you will, by their religious dress.

Mary says, “That’s what you think.” The expression “That’s what you think” is usually used to show that you disagree with what the other person says. Usually you say this right before you’re going to present a n example of why you think the other person is wrong, and that’s exactly what Mary  does. She disagrees with Alexei. She says, “That’s what you think.” And then  she gives her example of why Alexei is wrong. She says, “I called that man o ver there ‘Preacher’ and he gave me a dirty look.”

The term “preacher” (preacher) is another religious  title that could be applied to the lots of different people, not just a leader of a religious community or a Christian church, though there are many Christian c hurches who use “preacher” in the same way that other religious groups use “mi nister.” Mary says she just called someone “preacher” and that person gave her a “dirty look.” “To give someone a dirty look” means to look at them as if y ou were angry, to show that you didn’t like what that person said.

Alexei says, “No wonder,” meaning “Well, that’s not  surprising.” The person that Mary was talking to is the “caterer.” The “caterer”  (caterer) is the person whose job it is to prepare and serve food at a meeting or  event. Mary called the caterer, who of course is not a religious leader in any sens e, a “preacher,” and that’s why the caterer gave her a dirty look.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mary: I feel like an idiot!

Alexei: Why? What happened?

Mary: I just called the bishop over there “Pope.”

Alexei: That’s not so bad. You gave him a promotion . At least you didn’t call him “Rabbi.”

Mary: Don’t laugh! When I agreed to work at this in terfaith conference, I didn’t know I’d need a crash course in identifying religio us leaders from their dress.

 Alexei: It can’t be that hard. That man over there is clearly a cardinal, and the woman next to him is probably a minister by the loo k of her clerical collar.

Mary: What about the man in robes over there?

Alexei: He’s probably a lama or a guru. He’s defini tely not an imam, but I’m not entirely sure how I would address him.

Mary: See what I mean? I keep saying the wrong thin g.

Alexei: These religious leaders don’t expect laypeo ple like you and me to know as much as they do about religious dress.

Mary: That’s what you think! I called that man over  there “Preacher” and he gave me a dirty look.

Alexei: No wonder. He’s the caterer.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,164 – Making Office Renovations.

This episode is a dialogue between Alice and Dilber t about making changes, physical changes, to an office. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alice: I can’t hear you over that hammering. When a re these renovations going to be done?

Dilbert: They’re already two weeks past the schedul ed completion date and I can only guess at the cost overruns.

Alice: It feels like they’re never going to finish.

Dilbert: I know. When the renovations were announce d, I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.

Alice: Me, too.

Dilbert: The upgrades sounded good – new lighting f ixtures, flooring, and sound- deadening walls and ceilings.

Alice: I was looking forward to an updated look wit h new built-ins. This old furniture shows lots of wear and tear.

Dilbert: Yeah, now all I want is to be rid of all t his dust. Who can work with this racket?

 Alice: Heh? What did you say? Did you say you can’t  hack it? Me, neither!

[end of dialogue]

Alice says to Dilbert, “I can’t hear you over that hammering.” “To be able to hear someone over” (over) something means to be able to hear someone despite noise that is in the background that you are also h earing. “Hammering” (hammering) comes from the verb “to hammer.” “To ha mmer” means to take an object – called, interestingly enough, a “hammer” –  and hit another object, usually a small piece of metal called a “nail” (nai l).

We use a hammer to put nails into wood or other sur faces, other materials. “Hammering” is the sound that you get when you use a hammer. We often use hammers when we’re putting something together or bu ilding something. When Alice says she can’t hear Dilbert “over that hammer ing,” she means the hammering is so loud she cannot hear Dilbert talkin g.

She says, “When are these renovations going to be d one?” When are they going to be finished? “Renovations” (renovations) are cha nges to the appearance of a room or a building, usually changes that require ta king a wall down, or perhaps putting a new wall up, changing the floors – these are examples of renovations that might take place inside of a building or a roo m.

Dilbert says, “They’re already two weeks past the s cheduled completion date.” “They” in this case are the people who are making t he renovations. These people are “already two weeks past the scheduled completio n date.” The “completion date” would be the date when something is supposed to be finished, when something is supposed to be completed.

Dilbert says, “I can only guess at the cost overrun s.” “To guess at” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to estimate the amoun t or size of something based upon the information that you have. When Dilb ert says he can “only guess at the cost overruns,” he means he estimates or exp ects that the price of this delay in completing the project is going to be high . It’s going to be great.

“Cost overruns” (overruns) refer to the amount of m oney you have to spend, the expenses of a project, that are more than what you anticipated, more than what was planned. If you have ever done any renovations on your house or apartment, you know that usually they end up costing more than  what you expected or what the person doing the renovations told you they woul d cost.

Alice says, “It feels like they’re never going to f inish.” Dilbert responds, “I know. When the renovations were announced” – that is, whe n they were told that they were going to have these renovations – “I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.” “To reconfigure” ( reconfigure) something means to design it in a way that is new – to, we may say,  “redesign” it or “reorganize” something.

The offices were Dilbert works are being “reconfigu red for better use,” meaning they’re changing things around so that the office i s more efficient, perhaps. Alice says she was happy to hear the offices were going t o be reconfigured also. That’s why she says, “Me, too.” “Me, too” is an inf ormal way of saying “I agree” or “I also believe that.” Dilbert says, “The upgrades sounded good.” “Upgrades” (upgrades) are improvements in something – in this case, improvements in the office and the way that the office is configured.

Dilbert says that some of these upgrades include “n ew lighting fixtures and sound-deadening walls and ceilings.” “Lighting fixt ures” (fixtures) simply refers to the lamps and bulbs that are attached to the walls and the ceilings that are part of the room. A “fixture” is something usually that is permanently attached to a wall or a ceiling. A “ceiling” (ceiling) is the top  of a room. A room has a “floor” (floor) on the bottom, “walls” on the side, and a “ ceiling” on top.

Dilbert says the lighting fixtures were going to be  changed or upgraded, as was the flooring. The “flooring” refers of course to the kind of surface that is on the floor. Some rooms, such as the room I’m standing in  now, have wooden flooring. Some rooms have carpet as flooring. Dilbert says the upgrades also include “sound-deadening walls and ceilings.” Something tha t is “sound-deadening” (deadening) is something that reduces the amount of  noise in a room, usually by making the room quieter.

Alice says, “I was looking forward to the updated l ook with new built-ins.” “Updated” means more modern – something that is imp roved, something that is better. “Built -ins” are shelves, cabinets, and oth er pieces of furniture that are permanently attached to the walls – that is, they a ren’t things you can move around.

For example, in some rooms there are “built-in cabi nets” – things that you use for storage, things that you use to put things into. A built-in cabinet would be an example of a “built-in” – something that is put in to a room that is usually permanently attached to the ceiling or the floor or  the wall or all three.

Alice says, “This old furniture shows lots of wear and tear.” “To show” here means that you can see it. It is easily noticed. “W ear (wear) and tear (tear)” is an expression referring to the damage that occurs slow ly over time as things get used. So, if you have, for example, a chair in your  room, an old chair that has been there many years, it probably shows a little “ wear and tear” – that is, you can see that it’s old; perhaps it’s changed its col or or there are parts of the chair that need repairing.

Dilbert says, “Yeah, now all I want is to be rid of  all this dust.” To be rid (rid) of” something means to no longer have something, to be free of something that is bothering you or that you don’t like. In this case,  Dilbert doesn’t like all of the “dust” (dust). “Dust” usually refers to very small pieces of dirt or other particles, I guess we would call them, that collect on the floor  or on a piece of furniture.

If you go away from your house for a couple of mont hs and you return, there will probably be dust on the tables. You can put your ha nd on the table and move your fingers across the table, and when you lift your hand up, it will have dust on it – those little small pieces of dirt that collect  on, say, a piece of furniture. When you build something, or when you renovate something , there is also a lot of dust when they take down the walls or remove the ceiling s. Dust will also be present in those situations.

Dilbert then says, “Who can work with this racket?”  “Racket” (racket) here refers to a lot of noise, especially constant noise – nois e caused, for example, by construction or renovation. A mother might say to h er son, “Turn down your radio. I don’t want to hear all of that racket.” the mother is referring to probably her son’s music, which to her sounds just like nois e or racket.

As a noun, “racket” can also be used to describe wh at you use to play certain sporting games such as tennis and badminton. Those sports also use “rackets” – things that you hold in your hand to hit the ball o r the object that is used in the game. I think in badminton, in English we call it a  “birdie” (birdie). Well, that’s what we called it when we were kids. I think the te chnical name is something like “shuttlecock.” You don’t need to know that, unless you play badminton, of course.

It’s so loud, however, that Alice can’t hear Dilber t. She says, “Heh? What did you say? Did you say you can’t hack it? Me, neither!” “ To not be able to hack” (hack) something means you’re unable to do something. Dilb ert actually says the word “racket,” but Alice thinks he’s saying something el se. Because of all the noise, she can’t hear him properly. She thinks he said tha t he “can’t hack it,” meaning he can’t work. He can’t do anything because of all of this noise. He’s unable to perform his job.

 She agrees with him, even though that’s not what he  said. She says, “Me, neither!” meaning “I can’t either.” Once again, not ice that this is an informal way of saying “I don’t either” in English. We’ll often say, in normal conversation, “Me, neither,” even though your grammar book may say tha t that’s not correct.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alice: I can’t hear you over that hammering. When a re these renovations going to be done?

Dilbert: They’re already two weeks past the schedul ed completion date and I can only guess at the cost overruns.

Alice: It feels like they’re never going to finish.

Dilbert: I know. When the renovations were announce d, I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.

This episode is a dialogue between Akim and Wendy a bout eating food that is spicy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Akim: Oh, this is so good! Why are your eyes wateri ng?

Wendy: It’s so spicy! When you invited me over for curry, I didn’t know it’d be so hot.

Akim: This is mild or maybe medium. I make another version of this that’s much hotter. In fact, I like mine with some extra pepper s and some hot sauce. Do you want any?

Wendy: Are you kidding me?! The roof of my mouth is  on fire.

Akim: You must have very sensitive taste buds. This  has a little kick to it and it’s pungent and zesty, but it’s not too spicy.

Wendy: You must have no taste buds at all if you th ink this is mild. My mouth needs to cool down from all that heat. I need more water – now!

Akim: All right, but you don’t want to fill up on w ater. I’ve made a special dessert.

Wendy: Is that supposed to be mild, too?

Akim: No, that really is spicy!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about eating spicy food. The adject ive “spicy” (spicy) refers to a very strong flavor in your mouth that feels like your mouth is on fire, that your mouth is burning. When you eat spicy food, you migh t have to immediately drink some water because it’s as if your mouth were on fi re. Of course, it isn’t actually on fire, but that’s the meaning of this adjective “ spicy” when describing food.

Akim says, “Oh, this is so good!” Then he asks Wend y, “Why are your eyes watering?” If your eyes “water,” your eyes begin to  fill with what we call “tears” (tears), which is basically fluid that is in your e ye that is more than what your eye needs, and of course if there’s more fluid there, t hen the fluid – the tears come out of your eyes and go down your face. Usually peo ple have their eyes water when they are sad, when they are in pain, or as in the case of our dialogue, perhaps when the food is very spicy.

Wendy says, “It’s so spicy,” referring to the food.  “When you invited me over for curry, I didn’t know it’d be so hot.” “Curry” (curr y) is a dish usually associated with India, in which you cook meat and or vegetables in a spicy sauce. There are other kinds of curry as well. There’s Japanese curr y, which I really like. I also like Indian curry, just to be fair. However, here it app ears that Wendy and Akim are eating Indian curry.

Wendy was “invited over” by Akim, meaning Akim said , “Come to my house and we will eat a meal.” Curry can also be one of those  foods that is very hot because of the, what we would call, “spices” (spices). The word “spicy” of course comes from the word “spice.” We usually describe spicy fo od as being “hot.” The word “hot” can be used to describe food in two different  ways.

A food or a dish is “hot” when it is physically at a high temperature. The opposite of “hot” in that case would be “cold.” So, food can  be hot. Food can be cold. Here, however, “hot” means very spicy. The opposite  of “spicy food” is not “cold,” but “mild” (mild). So, we have “hot” and “cold” foo d, referring to temperature. We have “hot” and “mild” food, referring to the spicin ess of the food.

Akim says, “This is mild or maybe medium.” In betwe en “hot” and “mild” food, in terms of spiciness, is “medium” (medium). “Medium s picy” is a little spicy but not too spicy. Of course, that really depends on your t aste for food whether you think something is “mild” or “medium.”

Lots of other kinds of dishes can be spicy. Mexican  food, for example, can often be spicy. So can food from Thailand and many other countries. I know there are

many different types of food out there. I could spe nd all day mentioning the different kinds of food, but today we’re using as a n example Indian curry as being “hot,” “mild,” or “medium.”

Akim says, “I make another dish of this” – that is,  of curry – “that’s much hotter. In fact, I like mine,” meaning my curry, “with some ex tra peppers and some hot sauce.” “Peppers” (peppers) are vegetables that can  often make food very spicy, especially the seeds inside of the peppers. Peppers  come in different colors, and many peppers aren’t spicy at all, but some of them can be very spicy. Akim also mentions “hot sauce.” Hot sauce is a liquid that so me people put on their food that is usually made from spicy peppers.

Akim says, “Do you want any?” meaning any extra pep pers and hot sauce. Wendy says, “Are you kidding me?” That expression “ Are you kidding me?” when said in a certain way, means “Are you joking with m e? Are you crazy?” In other words, it’s said in disbelief – you can’t believe t he person is actually telling you what he’s telling you. In this case, Wendy can’t be lieve Akim actually thinks she wants her food to be even spicier.

She says, “The roof of my mouth is on fire.” The “r oof (roof) of your mouth” is the top part of your mouth, the part above your tongue.  You have a roof on your house, of course – that’s the top of your house. the roof of your mouth is the top of your mouth. “To be on fire” can mean to be actua lly burning with a flame, but here it just means to have a burning feeling or sen sation because the food is so spicy.

There’s another meaning of the expression “on fire”  that’s a little more recent in terms of its use. “To be on fire” can also mean to be doing something very well, to really be excelling or performing in a way that is the best that you can do, perhaps the best that anyone around you is doing.

For example, if you’re a basketball player and you’ re scoring a lot of points in a single game, we might describe you as being “on fir e,” meaning you’re doing really, really well. We could also say that you’re “hot.” In baseball, a “hot hitter” is someone who’s getting a lot of hits, especially in a short period of time. There is also the song you might have heard by Alicia Keys a  few years ago: “This girl is on fire.” Well, she sang it a little better than I did. I’m not really on fire when it comes to my singing right now.

Back to the dialogue. Akim says, “You must have ver y sensitive taste buds.” “Taste buds” (buds) are those points on your tongue  and in the inside of your mouth that can sense the taste of food. We call tho se “taste buds.” Akim says,

“This,” meaning this curry, “has a little kick to it.” When we describe food as having “a little kick (kick) to it,” we mean it’s a  little bit spicy. It’s not very spicy.

Akim says, “The food is pungent and zesty, but it’s  not too spicy.” “Pungent” (pungent) means having a very strong smell or taste . “Zesty” (zesty) usually refers to food that has a slightly spicy flavor. It ’s mild but it’s a little bit spicy. Wendy says, jokingly perhaps, to Akim, “You must ha ve no taste buds at all if you think this is mild. My mouth needs to cool down  from all that heat. I need more water – now!” Wendy says that Akim must not ha ve any taste buds if he doesn’t think this food is spicy.

She says, “My mouth needs to cool down from all tha t heat.” “To cool down” means to lower the temperature of something. Here it just means to feel less of the burning sensation. “Heat” (heat), again, means here something that is caused by very spicy food. People often drink water after they eat spicy food thinking that that will cool down their mouth and make the sensat ion of the burning disappear. I’m not sure if that actually happens, but people d o it. I heard somewhere that if you put salt in your mouth, that will help with the  burning sensation. I don’t know. Don’t ask me. I’m not an expert.

Anyway Akim tells Wendy not to “fill up on water” b ecause he’s made a special dessert. “To fill up on” something means to eat or drink a lot of something, so much so that you’re no longer hungry. If you are go ing to someone’s house for dinner and you have, say, a bag of Macadamia nuts ( which are my favorite kind of nuts, by the way, in case anyone’s looking for a  Christmas present to buy me), you don’t want to eat all of your bag of nuts. You don’t want to fill up on the macadamia nuts, because then you won’t be hungry for the dinner that you are going to go and eat, or are supposed to eat.

Akim says, “I’ve made a special dessert” (dessert).  A “dessert” is usually, in the United States anyway, a sweet food that is served a t the end of a meal. Wendy says, “Is that supposed to be mild, too?” She wants  to know if the dessert is going to be mild. Akim says, “No, that’s really spi cy.” Akim, of course, thinks his curry is mild, so if the dessert is supposed to be spicy, well then it will be really spicy for Wendy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Akim: Oh, this is so good! Why are your eyes wateri ng?

Wendy: It’s so spicy! When you invited me over for curry, I didn’t know it’d be so hot.

Akim: This is mild or maybe medium. I make another version of this that’s much hotter. In fact, I like mine with some extra pepper s and some hot sauce. Do you want any?

Wendy: Are you kidding me?! The roof of my mouth is  on fire.

Akim: You must have very sensitive taste buds. This  has a little kick to it and it’s pungent and zesty, but it’s not too spicy.

Wendy: You must have no taste buds at all if you th ink this is mild. My mouth needs to cool down from all that heat. I need more water – now!

Akim: All right, but you don’t want to fill up on w ater. I’ve made a special dessert.

Wendy: Is that supposed to be mild, too?

Akim: No, that really is spicy!

# Discussing Philosophy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,166 – Discussing Philosophy.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a very de ep discussion between Rene and Francis discussing philosophy. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Rene: Why are you sitting here just staring into sp ace?

Francis: I’m pondering life.

Rene: That sounds profound.

Francis: I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint. I’m not sure I really exist. Maybe my entire life is an illusion a nd there’s no such thing as reality.

Rene: Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?

Francis: I’m better now that I’ve made some decisio ns about my epistemological outlook on life. I’m allowing reason and logic to g uide me.

Rene: That’s great, but you still seem a little dis tracted.

Francis: That’s because I’m wrestling with some maj or questions about ethics and morality. It’s not easy always trying to do the  right thing.

Rene: I can understand that, but could you get me .  . .

Francis: But then I think that perhaps the only thi ng that matters in life are esthetics, and I should devote my life to creating beauty.

 Rene: That’s a nice idea, but have you given any th ought to how you’d pay the rent? You could start by getting me a cup of coffee .

Francis: Ah, I see you’re a realist. Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?

[end of dialogue]

Rene asks Francis, “Why are you sitting here just s taring in to space?” “To stare” (stare) means to look at something for a long time.  “To stare into space” usually means to “daydream” – to sit in a single spot and t hink about something. You are looking at something but you’re not really focusing  on anything. You are instead thinking about something else. You are thinking per haps about a problem, or you’re dreaming of something good, perhaps of somet hing bad.

When you think of something and imagine something a nd you’re not sleeping, we call that “daydreaming.” “Staring into space” is ba sically the same as daydreaming. It’s thinking, perhaps deeply, about s omething, not paying attention to what’s going on around you. Francis says, “I’m p ondering life.” “To ponder” (ponder) means to think about something very seriou sly. We might say “to consider something deeply.”

Rene says, “That sounds profound.” Something that i s “profound” (profound) is something with a lot of meaning or significance or importance. Another adjective we might use simply is one that I’ve already used, which is “deep.” “To be profound” is “to be deep” – to be serious, to have something very perhaps insightful in your comments or in your thinking. Fr ancis says, “I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint.” A “standpoint ” (standpoint) is a perspective, a particular way of thinking about something. It mi ght also be considered a point of view or an outlook.

“Metaphysical” (metaphysical) refers to the efforts  to understand the nature of the world, to understand the larger meaning of our exis tence. “Metaphysics” is considered a “branch” (branch) or type of philosoph y. It usually deals with subjects such as being and knowing and existence – “fundamental concepts,” you might say, in philosophy. Aristotle is most fam ous for his metaphysics. A “metaphysical standpoint,” then, if it means anythi ng, I guess would be contemplating or thinking about your existence and your being.

Francis says, “I’m not really sure I really exist.”  “To exist” means to be real, to be actual, not to be imaginary. He says, “Maybe my ent ire life is an illusion and

there’s no such thing as reality.” An “illusion” (i llusion) is something that you see but isn’t real. It doesn’t actually exist. “Reality ” (reality) is that which really does exist – things that are not imaginary or not fake.

I don’t want to get into long philosophical discuss ions with you about reality and existence. I’m giving you the general meanings of t hese terms as they might be used in normal conversation, less than perhaps in a  philosophical discussion, even though this dialogue is entitled “Discussing P hilosophy.” Rene says, “Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?” She’s askin g if perhaps Francis is feeling sick or ill.

Francis says, “I’m better now that I’ve made some d ecisions about my epistemological outlook on life.” “Epistemological”  comes from the term “epistemology” (epistemology). “Epistemology” is an other one of those areas of study in philosophy. “Epistemology” has to do with the study of knowledge and how we know things, or how we get to know things. H ow is it that we know what is true? How is it that we know what we know? Those  are questions that epistemology might try to answer. “Epistemological outlook,” then, would be the way that you view how knowledge is acquired, I gues s.

Francis says, “I’m allowing reason and logic to gui de me.” “Reason” (reason) refers to the mind’s ability to think, to understan d, to form conclusions. “Logic” (logic), in general conversation, usually refers to  a clear, organized way of thinking about something. Logic is another one of t hose areas of philosophy. In some ways, logic is the set of tools that philosoph ers use to understand things. Logic refers to how arguments are constructed, how you put together an argument in order to reach a conclusion.

Francis says he’s going to allow reason and logic t o guide him, which seems fair enough, reasonable enough. Rene says, “That’s great , but you still seem a little distracted.” Someone who is “distracted” (distracte d) is unable to focus on something, often because he is thinking about somet hing else instead of what perhaps he should be thinking about. Francis respon ds that he’s distracted because he’s “wrestling with some major questions a bout ethics and morality.”

The phrasal verb “to wrestle (wrestle) with” someth ing means to debate or to think very seriously about a problem, a problem tha t you’re finding difficult perhaps to solve or to come to a conclusion about. “I’m wrestling with the choice I have to make about what I’m going to eat for dinner .” I’m not sure. I’m going back and forth. I’m debating. Should I have chicken? Sho uld I have vegetables? I’m wrestling with my decision. Well, not really. I’m g oing to have chicken and vegetables. But that’s the meaning of the phrasal v erb “to wrestle with.”

 Francis is “wrestling with some major,” or importan t, “questions.” These are questions about “ethics” (ethics) and “morality” (m orality). These two terms are often used in a similar way in conversational Engli sh. I’m no philosopher. I’m not going to try to give you exact definitions. “Morali ty,” however, I would generally tend to use to describe certain principles of what is right and what is wrong. Sometimes those principles, or laws, or rules, or s tandards are taken from a religious point of view, sometimes not.

“Ethics” relates to the application of those moral principles to perhaps specific situations, determining whether you should do somet hing or not do something. However, having said that, ethics could also refer to those same moral principles that people use to determine whether something is r ight or wrong, just or unjust.

In modern American English, my guess is that many p eople would associate morality with a religious point of view and ethics with, not necessarily an areligious point of view, but one that may not be b ased on a religious belief system. But that’s a very general way of defining it that not everyone may agree with. This is philosophy, after all. People disagre e about things like this.

Francis says, “It’s not always easy trying to do the right thing.” Rene says, “I can understand that but could you get me . . .” And the n Francis interrupts her and continues, “But then I think that perhaps the only thing that matters in life,” that’s important in life, “are esthetics and I should devo te my life to creating beauty.” Francis says perhaps the only thing important in li fe, that matters in life, are “esthetics” (esthetics). “Esthetics” refers to the study of beauty, of appreciating beauty in other things and in other people. Francis  thinks he should devote his life to creating beauty.

Rene says, “That’s a nice idea, but have you given any thought” – that is, have you thought about – “Have you given any thought to how you’d pay the rent?” meaning if you spend your life creating beauty, wil l you make enough money to afford to pay your rent? Rene says, “You could star t by getting me a cup of coffee.” Now we realize that Francis is actually wo rking at a coffee shop, maybe Starbucks, and Rene is one of his customers who wan ts a cup of coffee.

Francis says, “Ah, I see you’re a realist.” And the n he asks, “Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?” A “real ist” (realist) is a person who, I suppose in this case, accepts things as they are, o ne who uses logic to understand the way the world works. Francis then as ks Rene if she wants her “usual,” meaning the coffee drink she usually gets,  or if she wants to hear the “specials” – the special drinks that the coffee sho p is offering today.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rene: Why are you sitting here just staring into sp ace?

Francis: I’m pondering life.

Rene: That sounds profound.

Francis: I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint. I’m not sure I really exist. Maybe my entire life is an illusion a nd there’s no such thing as reality.

Rene: Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?

Francis: I’m better now that I’ve made some decisio ns about my epistemological outlook on life. I’m allowing reason and logic to g uide me.

Rene: That’s great, but you still seem a little dis tracted.

Francis: That’s because I’m wrestling with some maj or questions about ethics and morality. It’s not easy always trying to do the  right thing.

Rene: I can understand that, but could you get me .  . .

Francis: But then I think that perhaps the only thi ng that matters in life are esthetics, and I should devote my life to creating beauty.

Rene: That’s a nice idea, but have you given any th ought to how you’d pay the rent? You could start by getting me a cup of coffee .

Francis: Ah, I see you’re a realist. Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?

This episode is a dialogue between Nancy and Yasman i about what order you were born in your family – what number you were amo ng your brothers and sisters – and if that’s really important. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Isn’t this a great time of year? Families ge t together over the holidays.

Yasmani: Maybe it’s nice for some families, but I d read my family get-togethers.

Nancy: How come?

Yasmani: I have a big family and there has always b een a lot of sibling rivalry.

Nancy: I’m sure that was true when you were growing  up, but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you?

Yasmani: Not us. The firstborn still thinks he’s in  charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family  is still rebellious.

Nancy: That’s true in a lot of families.

Yasmani: Yes, but when we get together, we compete to show up the others. We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s rather pathetic, act ually.

Nancy: How do your parents handle all that?

Yasmani: They’ve always left us to our own devices.  We just fight it out amongst ourselves.

Nancy: So, there’s no loving bond between the sibli ngs.

Yasmani: Oh, we love each other, but we compete wit h other, too. It’s complicated.

Nancy: Then I should be glad to be an only child?

Yasmani: That’s right. Count your blessings!

[end of dialogue]

Nancy says to Yasmani, “Isn’t this a great time of year? Families get together over the holidays.” The “holidays” in the United St ates is a term we use to refer to November and December, when there are two major hol idays in the U.S. – or three major holidays in the U.S. – Thanksgiving at the end of November, and then Hanukkah, and Christmas in December.

Yasmani says, “Maybe it’s nice for some families, b ut I dread my family get- togethers.” “To dread” (dread) means to be worried about something, to not want something to happen. “To dread” is the opposite of “to look forward to.” If you “look forward to” something, you want something to happen. You desire something to happen. “To dread” is the opposite. “T o dread” is to be afraid that something will happen or worried about something th at might happen.

A “get-together” is a informal gathering of people,  usually for some social reason – a birthday party, a Christmas celebration, or sim ply time for people to come together and relax, talk, and have a good time. The  noun “get-together” comes from the phrasal verb “to get together.” Yasmani dr eads his family get-togethers. Nancy asks, “How come?” “How come” is another way of saying, “Why?”

Yasmani responds, “I have a big family and there ha s always been a lot of sibling rivalry.” Your “siblings” (siblings) are your broth ers and sisters. “Sibling” is a general term for brothers and sisters. It’s not tha t common in conversational English. Normally someone will refer to his brother s or his sisters, or say simply, “my brothers and sisters.” But if you want a single  term for that, it would be “sibling.” Your “siblings” are your brothers and si sters. When you say “sibling,” you’re not specifying if it’s a brother or a sister .

Yasmani says there has always been a lot of “siblin g rivalry.” “Rivalry” (rivalry) refers to competition. We talk about rivalry betwee n two sports teams. There is a rivalry between the San Francisco Giants baseball t eam and the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. When those two teams play, t here’s a lot of emotion involved in the crowd and among the players because  they have always played each other and tried to be the best team, tried to beat the other team. Yasmani says there is rivalry among his siblings, his broth ers and sisters.

Nancy says, “I’m sure that was true when you were g rowing up,” meaning I’m sure that there was sibling rivalry when you were y ounger, “but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you?” “To grow out of” something  means because you’re older, to no longer do something or like something or have  something.

When I was in high school, sometimes, though not ve ry often, I liked to play video games. But eventually I grew out of it. When I got to college, it no longer interested me anymore. I “grew out of” playing vide o games. Usually we use the expression “to grow out of” something when we’re re ferring to an activity that we associate with children or teenagers or younger peo ple.

Nancy is saying that surely Yasmani and his sibling s have grown out of all of this rivalry they had when they were children. Yasmani s ays, however, no. He says, “Not us,” meaning no, we have not. “The firstborn s till thinks he’s in charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family is still rebellious.” The “firstborn” is, unsurprisingly, the oldest child – the first child to be born in a family.

“The firstborn still thinks he’s in charge,” Yasman i says. “To be in charge” (charge) means to be in a position of authority or control – to be the person who’s, in effect, the boss, the one who is responsi ble for telling other people what to do. The “middle children” would refer to the chi ldren in a family that has at least three children, who are neither the oldest no r the youngest.

So, in a family of four children, there is an oldes t child, the youngest child, and then the two other children would be, I guess, the middle children. In my family, where there are 11 children, there are nine middle children, although in my family, we divide our family into the oldest four, the youngest four, and the middle three.

I, of course, am in the youngest four, and in fact am the “baby” of the family. The “baby” of the family doesn’t refer to someone who i s actually still under two years of age, but rather to the youngest child in the fam ily. It’s often said, however, as a way of indicating that perhaps that youngest child has certain privileges or that

he’s treated somehow differently – more special, pe rhaps – than the other children. This was never the case for me, of course .

Yasmani mentions how the middle children in his fam ily “act up” to get attention. “To act up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to b ehave in certain ways, to behave badly so that someone will pay attention to you or will notice you. The baby of the family in Yasmani’s family is “rebellio us” (rebellious). “Rebellious” comes from the verb “to rebel” (rebel). “To rebel” means to resist someone else’s authority – to refuse to do what someone else says you should do, especially someone else in power. Nancy says, “That’s true in a lot of families.”

Yasmani says, “Yes, but when we get together,” when  my family comes together and is in the same room at the same time, “we compe te to show up the others.” “To show up” someone is a – say it with me – two-wo rd phrasal verb meaning to do or say something to show that you are better tha n another person, you are superior to another person. So, if your son comes h ome from school and says, “I got a B on my test,” and your daughter says, “Well I got an A on my test,” your daughter may be trying to show up your son – to dem onstrate that she is superior to your son.

Yasmani says, “We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s ra ther pathetic, actually.” Yasmani says he and his siblings “brag” (brag). “To  brag” means to say something about yourself that makes you look better  than everyone else or to say something that you have done that is wonderful that will make other people think that you are wonderful or successful. There a re, of course, always people who like to brag, who like to talk about how wonder ful they are. Some people think all Americans like to brag. I think that migh t have a little bit of truth in it.

“To nitpick” (nitpick) means to criticize other peo ple for very small mistakes or faults or errors. To say something is “pathetic” (p athetic) in this case means that it’s so bad you almost feel sorry for the people th at they are so, perhaps, insecure or mean or miserable that they have to act  that way. Sometimes we use this adjective “pathetic” to mean “inadequate” in s uch a way that it’s almost laughable or you almost feel sorry for the person.

If someone tries to throw a ball 50 feet and the ba ll only goes 10 feet because the person doesn’t know how to throw a ball, you mi ght say, “Well, that was pathetic.” That was really so terrible you almost f eel sorry for the person. Nancy asks, “How do your parents handle all that?” meanin g how do your parents react, how do they view or take care of the situation?

Yasmani says, “They’ve always left us to our own de vices.” “To leave someone to his own devices” (devices) means to let someone do something without interfering, without doing anything to influence hi s actions or decisions. Often this expression is used when someone does something that  you don’t think is a good idea, or when someone shows bad judgment or makes a  bad decision.

You might say, for example, “Children, when left to  their own devices, will watch television all day instead of studying for school.”  We’re saying there that if we don’t do anything to influence them or to control t hem perhaps, children will make bad decisions. I’m not saying that’s true, but that ’s one possible use of that expression, and it is typically used when you’re de scribing a situation in which someone doesn’t make a very good decision.

Yasmani says, We just fight it out amongst ourselve s,” meaning we just fight and our parents don’t do anything about it. Nancy says,  “So there’s no loving bond between the siblings.” A “bond” (bond) here would m ean a close relationship or connection between people. Yasmani says, “Oh, we lo ve each other, but we compete with each other, too. It’s complicated,” he  says, meaning it’s a situation that’s difficult to explain, perhaps.

Nancy says, “Then I should be glad to be an only ch ild?” If you are an “only child,” you are the only child that your parents ha d. You do not have any brothers and sisters. You have no siblings. Yasmani agrees w ith Nancy. He says yes, you should be glad you are an only child. “Count your b lessings!” he says. The expression “to count your blessings” (blessings) me ans to be grateful for, or appreciative of, the good things that you have.

Now, interestingly enough, I don’t think anyone who  comes from a larger family would actually say what Yasmani says. I’ve never me t anyone who comes from a family of more than three or four children who thin ks that it would have been better had his family only had one child. But of co urse, I’m the youngest of eleven, so maybe I’m thinking if my parents only ha d one child, it wouldn’t have been me.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Isn’t this a great time of year? Families ge t together over the holidays.

Yasmani: Maybe it’s nice for some families, but I d read my family get-togethers.

 Nancy: How come?

Yasmani: I have a big family and there has always b een a lot of sibling rivalry.

Nancy: I’m sure that was true when you were growing  up, but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you?

Yasmani: Not us. The firstborn still thinks he’s in  charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family  is still rebellious.

Nancy: That’s true in a lot of families.

Yasmani: Yes, but when we get together, we compete to show up the others. We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s rather pathetic, act ually.

Nancy: How do your parents handle all that?

Yasmani: Oh, we love each other, but we compete wit h other, too. It’s complicated.

Nancy: Then I should be glad to be an only child?

Yasmani: That’s right. Count your blessings!

This episode is a dialogue between Barbara and Sean  about reading a contract – a legal document, a legal agreement – very carefull y. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Barbara: Just sign on the dotted line and be done w ith it.

Sean: Didn’t your parents ever teach you to read ev ery document carefully before you sign it?

Barbara: Not when the contract is boilerplate. All of the terms are standard.

Sean: No, they’re not. Did you notice in the fine p rint that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for additional charges ?

Barbara: Really? No, I guess I missed that.

Sean: If you had gone through this document with a fine-tooth comb as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for  the other side to end the contract at any time.

Barbara: I guess I overlooked those.

Sean: And there are contingencies for problems on t heir end, but not on ours.

Barbara: Wow, I didn’t realize they were trying to screw us. Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.

 Sean: Relax. This is par for the course with this k ind of contract. They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to f ind them. We just have to be vigilant, that’s all.

Barbara: Do you think this is going to take much lo nger? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.

Sean: It’ll take as long as it takes. What do you t hink that cot is for?

[end of dialogue]

Barbara says to Sean, “Just sign on the dotted line  and be done with it.” Barbara is telling Sean to sign his name – to put his signa ture on some sort of contract, some sort of an agreement. A “contract” (contract) is an agreement between two or more people or two or more groups. It usually is  used to refer to something that is, what we would say, “legally binding” (bind ing), meaning that you are required by law to do what you say you’re going to do in the contract, and if you don’t, you could be punished.

Barbra is telling Sean to “sign on the dotted (dott ed) line.” It used to be, in many written contracts, that there was a line on which y ou put your signature. Now, there’s still a line on most contracts, but it was more common I guess, in the old days, to make it a “dotted line,” meaning it wasn’t  an uninterrupted line that you would draw with a pencil – rather, it was basically  a series of short lines or small points which we would call “dots.” And these little  dots were on the paper in the form of a line, and you would put your name on that  line. “To sign on the dotted line,” then, means to sign the contract.

Sean says, “Didn’t your parents ever teach you to r ead every document carefully before you sign it?” Sean is surprised that Barbara  wants him to sign this contract without reading it carefully. Barbara says, “Not wh en the contract is boilerplate.” “Boilerplate” (boilerplate) – one word – is languag e that is used in some document that is very common, that is used in many different documents of this sort.

Nowadays we would say you basically “copy and paste ” the text – that is, it is text that is used in all the contracts or in all the doc uments of this sort, and therefore the idea is that you don’t really have to read it e very time. Once you read it, you don’t need to read it again because it’s going to b e the same in the next contract or the next document.

Barbara continues, “All of the terms are standard.”  The “terms” (terms) of a contract are the things that the contract says you have to do or the other person has to do. They are requirements of the agreement. “To be standard” means that they are usual – there’s nothing different about th em that you wouldn’t normally expect in a contract of this type. Of course, we’re  not exactly sure yet what the contract is. Sean says, “No, they’re not,” meaning the terms are not standard. They’re not the usual ones you would expect.

He then asks, “Did you notice” – did you see – “in the fine print that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for addit ional charges?” The “fine (fine) print (print)” of a document or an agreement  is the specifics of an agreement that often, in certain legal contracts, a ctually appear in a smaller font size – in a smaller size. The word “fine” here refe rs to the size of the letters, the “print,” in the contract.

In some contracts, there are some words that are wr itten larger than others. The words that are written in the smaller print, or the  fine print, often contain very important details about the contract that many peop le don’t read. The “fine print” can also refer in general to the specifics or the d etails of any agreement, even if they are not actually written in smaller font sizes . Sean says that if the agreement is “canceled” – that is, if it is ended before it i s supposed to end – “we’re on the hook for additional charges.”

The expression “to be on the hook” (hook) means you  are responsible, usually financially responsible, for something. If there is  something in the agreement that says that if you cancel the agreement, you have to pay a “fine” – that is you have to pay the other person some money – that’s an exam ple of being on the hook for something. It’s usually some term in the agreem ent that requires you to pay something if certain things happen, such as the agr eement being “cancelled.”

Barbara is surprised. She says, “Really? I guess I missed that,” meaning I didn’t see that. Sean continues, “If you had gone through this document” – that is, if you had read this document – “with a fine-tooth com b as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for the other side  to end the contract at any time.” The expression “to go through something with  a fine (fine) – tooth (tooth) comb” means to look at something very carefully, to  make sure you don’t miss anything. Notice once again the use of the word “fi ne” here to mean “small.”

A “comb” is something you would normally use on you r hair to keep it straight. A man would use a comb to make sure that his hair is flat against his head. I don’t use a comb anymore since I don’t have any hair. If I did, however, I might use a “fine-tooth comb.” The “teeth” of a comb, like the teeth in your mouth, are things

that extend down from the top. A comb has a number of different little pieces of plastic – or whatever the comb is made of – that are used in order to make the comb work to go through your hair.

So, a “fine-tooth comb” would be a comb that has ma ny small, close together, usually, “teeth” that are used to put the hair back  into place. Anyway, here the expression just means to look at something very car efully. A “loophole” (loophole) is something in a law or in an agreement  such as a contract that is not very clear and that could be used to benefit one si de or the other.

In this case, Sean is saying that there are “loopho les” in the contract so that the other party or the other group of people who are si gning the contract can end it at any time. The word “party” (party), when we’re talk ing about a contract, can refer to a single person or to a group of people.

Barbara again says, “I guess I overlooked those.” “ To overlook” (overlook) here means not to understand the importance of something  or simply not to have seen something because you didn’t look carefully. Sean t hen says, “And there are contingencies for problems on their end, but not on  ours.” A “contingency” (contingency) in a contract is something that says what will happen in the future under certain conditions.

So, for example, a contract might have a “contingen cy” that says that if you are unable to pay the money that you owe in this contra ct, you may have to pay an additional fine, an additional amount of money, to the other party in the contract. There are “contingencies” in this contract that Sea n and Barbara are talking about that will help the other side, the other part y in the contract. That’s what Sean means by “problems on their end, but not on ou rs.”

Barbara says, “Wow, I didn’t realize they,” meaning  the other people in the contract, “were trying to screw (screw) us.” “To sc rew” someone is a vulgar term that I wouldn’t normally recommend you use, but it means to be very unfair to someone, to try to “cheat” (cheat) another person, to do something that wouldn’t be very nice. A better way of saying this, a more p olite way, would be “to take advantage of us,” or “to try” perhaps even “to chea t us.”

Barbara says, “Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.” Sean says, however, “Relax,” meaning don’t worry. “This is par for the course with this kind of contract.” For something “to be par (par) for the c ourse (course)” means for something to be normal, something to be common or s tandard, something to be expected. It’s actually a term from the game of gol f.

“Par” is the normal score, the standard score, that  you would expect on a given hole in golf. Golf is normally a game that is divid ed up into basically 18 parts. Each part of the game requires you to hit a ball in to a hole. What is “par for the course” is what is the normal score that people wou ld get for this particular golf course. Every golf course is a little different. So me are easier, some are harder.

Anyway, back to the story. We use the term “par for  the course” simply to mean standard, normal, usual. Sean continues, “They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to find them. We just have to be v igilant, that’s all.” “To sneak (sneak) in” something means to try to get something  in a, in this case, contract without the other person noticing – to try to do it  in secret.

Sean says that he and Barbara have to be “vigilant”  (vigilant). “To be vigilant” means to be very careful about something, to be awa re of what is happening, to be looking out for problems or even danger. It mean s in a sense to stay awake, to be aware of what is going on – in this case, to be very careful in looking at the contract.

Barbara says, “Do you think this is going to take m uch longer? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.” So now w e understand that Barbara and Sean are in the same building as the other pers on or people who are part of this contract, and that they are waiting in the oth er room “to finalize” (finalize) the agreement. “To finalize” means to finish or complet e something.

Sean says, however, “It’ll take as long as it takes .” That expression, “It will take as long as it takes,” means that you, in a way, don ’t have any control over the time, or I’m going to take as long as I need to do this right. It’s that second meaning that Sean I think is trying to convey here.  He’s saying he’s going to take his time. He’s going to look at this closely even i f it takes a long time. “It’ll take as long as it takes.”

Sean says, “What do you think that cot is for?” A “ cot” (cot) is a portable folding bed. It’s what you might use, for example, if you g o camping. It’s what might be used, for example, in the military, when you have l ots of different people in a single place and you don’t have beds for everyone. You may have these portable beds called “cots.”

I once slept on a cot for about six months when I d idn’t have a place to stay when I was a younger man, in my twenties. That’s a long story – I’ll tell you that some other time. Sean is sort of making a joke, or maybe  not. He’s saying that they’re going to be there so long they may have to sleep in  that room, and that’s what

 the cot is for, because it’s going to take a long t ime for Sean to finish looking at this contract.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Barbara: Just sign on the dotted line and be done w ith it.

Sean: Didn’t your parents ever teach you to read ev ery document carefully before you sign it?

Barbara: Not when the contract is boilerplate. All of the terms are standard.

Sean: No, they’re not. Did you notice in the fine p rint that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for additional charges ?

Barbara: Really? No, I guess I missed that.

Sean: If you had gone through this document with a fine-tooth comb as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for  the other side to end the contract at any time.

Barbara: I guess I overlooked those.

Sean: And there are contingencies for problems on t heir end, but not on ours.

Barbara: Wow, I didn’t realize they were trying to screw us. Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.

Sean: Relax. This is par for the course with this k ind of contract. They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to f ind them. We just have to be vigilant, that’s all.

Barbara: Do you think this is going to take much lo nger? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.

Sean: It’ll take as long as it takes. What do you t hink that cot is for?

# Being Talkative and Reserved

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,169 – Being Talkative and Reserved.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  1,169. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about someone who talk too much, an d someone who doesn’t talk enough. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.

Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?

Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft- spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No on e could get a word in edgewise with her.

Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than tryin g to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.

Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.

Artem: Ooh, that’s a little harsh.

Marcia: Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the bl athering, gossipy type.

Artem: I wonder . . .

Marcia: What?

 Artem: I wonder what they’re saying about us.

[end of dialogue]

Marcia begins by saying, “Phew! I thought they’d ne ver leave,” meaning they stayed a very long time. Marcia is referring to two  guests that they had over, two women from work, I think. Artem says, “I enjoyed th eir company, didn’t you?” “Company” (company) here means something different than you may expect. “Company” means the time that you spend with other people. That’s what it means here – the presence of another person.

If someone says, “I’m very bad company,” he means I ’m not a good person to be with; I’m not a good person to spend time with. It’ s a very different meaning than the one you may be thinking of normally, which woul d refer to a business. But here, “company” means the presence of another perso n. Marcia says, “Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft-spoken, and on the  shy side.” So, there were two women who were visiting them. One of them is Jessie .

Marcia thinks Jessie is “fine,” meaning okay. She d escribes her as being “a little reserved” (reserved). “To be reserved” means to be quiet, not to talk a lot, but also not to share your opinions – not to tell other  people what you are thinking or feeling. Jessie is also described as being “soft (s oft) – spoken (spoken).” A person who is “soft-spoken” doesn’t speak very loud ly. Sometimes it’s hard to hear what they’re saying. I have never been called “soft-spoken.” I wonder why.

Jessie is soft-spoken and “on the shy (shy) side.” “To be shy” means to be perhaps uncomfortable being around other people or talking to other people. We might use the adjective “timid” (timid) to describe  a person who is shy. “On the shy side” (side) means that she’s a little bit shy,  maybe not all that much. Marcia describes the other woman, Kelly, as being someone who “talked our ear off.”

She says, “Kelly, on the other hand” – meaning in c omparison to, or in addition to – “talked our ear off.” “To talk someone’s ear off”  means to talk a lot, to talk too much. “No one could get a word in edgewise with her ,” Marcia says. “To get a word in edgewise” (edgewise) means that you are alm ost unable to talk because the other person is talking so much. “To get a word  in edgewise” would mean to give your opinion, or simply to say something, to s omeone who is talking so much, it’s very difficult to get a chance to talk.

Artem, however, says that he thinks Kelly’s anecdot es were funny. An “anecdote” (anecdote) is a funny, or humorous, story about som ething that really happened.

It’s not the same as a joke. A “joke” is often some thing that is imaginary, that never took place. An anecdote is a story that is fu nny but that did take place. Artem describes Kelly as being “a little long-winde d.” A person who is a “long (long) – winded (winded)” is a person who talks too  much, who talks too long, so long that you begin to get a little bored by the pe rson.

Artem says, “I enjoyed talking to her,” meaning Kel ly, “more than trying to make conversation with Jessie” (the other woman). “To ma ke conversation” with someone is to try to talk to a person. Americans, i n some parts of the country, often make conversation with strangers – people who m they’ve never met before.

That doesn’t happen very often in Los Angeles or Ne w York. In fact, if you try to make conversation with someone – say, at a grocery store or waiting for a bus – the person might think you’re a little weird, might  even try to get away from you because that’s not what people do in big cities in the U.S., but in smaller towns and in certain areas in the United States, it’s ver y common for people “to make conversation,” even with people they don’t know ver y well.

Artem had difficulty making conversation with Jessi e. That’s because, in Artem’s words, “she is so closemouthed and guarded that it”  – making conversation – “was like pulling teeth.” “To be closemouthed” mean s to not be willing to speak. It’s similar to being shy. But it refers specifical ly to someone who doesn’t like talking.

“To be guarded” (guarded) means that you are carefu l and cautious, usually because you don’t want to tell someone something yo u don’t want them to know, a secret. Someone who is very guarded is someone wh o doesn’t tell you what he’s thinking, perhaps because he doesn’t want to t ell you something that he thinks is a secret or wants to keep a secret. That’ s why Artem found talking to Jessie “like pulling teeth.” This is a common expre ssion, “like pulling (pulling) teeth.”

Something that is “like pulling teeth” is something  that is very difficult to do, something that is very challenging, often because t he other person doesn’t cooperate. The other person you’re trying to do thi s with doesn’t do what you want them to do, especially when it comes to talkin g. “Getting an answer from our lawyer that we could actually understand was li ke pulling teeth.” Our lawyer was always using these long words, these legal term s we didn’t understand. Or, “Trying to get my brother to answer a question is l ike pulling teeth.” It’s very difficult.

Marcia says, “I’d rather talk to someone who is a l ittle reticent than a loudmouth.” “To be reticent” (reticent) means to be unwilling t o share your opinion, to be unwilling to talk about a certain topic – perhaps b ecause you don’t want to, perhaps because you don’t think the other person ne eds to know.

A “loudmouth” (loudmouth) – one word – is, as you m ight guess, a person who always talks very loudly and often too much, someon e who perhaps tries to impress other people by bragging, by saying how goo d he is. A loudmouth is, in general, a person who we consider somewhat “obnoxio us” – that is, not a very likeable person. Marcia prefers to talk to someone who is a little reticent than someone who’s a loudmouth.

Artem says, “Ooh, that’s a little harsh.” “To be ha rsh” (harsh) means to be a little mean, a little cruel, too unkind. Marcia says, “May be you’re right, but I don’t like the blathering, gossipy type.” “To blather” (blathe r) means to use a lot of words but not really to say anything. Someone who “blathe rs” is someone who maybe doesn’t know what they want to say but keeps talkin g anyway, or isn’t very intelligent and therefore simply talks without real ly thinking about it before he opens his mouth. So, “blathering” would be a person  who is like that, who blathers.

“Gossipy” (gossipy) refers to someone who enjoys ta lking about other people and mentioning things that may or may not be true. “Gos sip” is something that people talk about, often things that are bad about the oth er person that may be true or may not be true. Many magazines and newspapers publ ish gossip – things that may be true, but they may not, too. Another word for these things is “rumors” (rumors) – information that people tell other peopl e even though they aren’t sure that the information is correct.

Marcia doesn’t like the “blathering, gossipy type,”  meaning that kind of person. Artem says, “I wonder . . .” Marcia says, “What?” “ I wonder what they’re saying about us.” Artem is wondering what their friends Je ssie and Kelly might be saying about Artem and Marcia. The answer is probably noth ing. People often think that other people are more interested in their lives tha n they really are, and we’re guessing their friends from work aren’t really all that interested in Marcia, Artem, and their particular relationship.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marcia: Phew! I thought they’d never leave.

 Artem: I enjoyed their company, didn’t you?

Marcia: Jessie is fine, a little reserved and soft- spoken, and on the shy side. Kelly, on the other hand, talked our ear off. No on e could get a word in edgewise with her.

Artem: I thought Kelly’s anecdotes were funny. She was a little long-winded, I’ll admit, but I enjoyed talking to her more than tryin g to make conversation with Jessie. She is so closemouthed and guarded that it was like pulling teeth.

Marcia: I’d rather talk to someone who is a little reticent than a loudmouth.

Artem: Ooh, that’s a little harsh.

Marcia: Maybe you’re right, but I don’t like the bl athering, gossipy type.

Artem: I wonder . . .

Marcia: What?

Artem: I wonder what they’re saying about us.

[end of dialogue]

There’s nothing blathering about our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. She always knows what she’s saying and how to say it.

# Naming Children

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,170 – Naming Children.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,170. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this epis ode. Go to our website for more details – that is, for more information.

This episode is a dialogue about the names that you  give your children, and perhaps a few that you don’t want to give your chil dren. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: So, here is my shortlist.

Albert: A shortlist for what?

Celeste: Baby names.

Albert: We have months to decide. Don’t you think w e should wait?

Celeste: No, I want to be prepared. Here, take a lo ok. See what you think.

Albert: Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekie l? He’ll be teased by every kid in school.

Celeste: It’s a family name. I was trying to appeas e my parents. They’ve been suggesting a lot of family names. We could call him  by a nickname, maybe “Zeke.”

Albert: I’m not naming my child Ezekiel. His name w ould be Ezekiel Eckleman. That’s a mouthful. I also want to steer clear of al literative names. I’ve never liked them.

Celeste: Okay, are there any names you like on my l ist?

Albert: Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.

 Celeste: Why not? I thought we’d name the baby afte r my grandfather. Alan is a nice first name and Phillip is a nice middle name.

Albert: His initials would be “A.P.E.” – ape! He wo uld never live that down.

Celeste: How about “Mikol”?

Albert: You mean an alternate spelling for “Michael ”? People don’t know how to pronounce a name with an odd spelling.

Celeste: Well, are there any names you do like?

Albert: Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.

Celeste: As you say, we have months to decide. Let’ s keep an open mind.

Albert: Humph!

[end of dialogue]

Celeste begins our dialogue by saying to Albert, “S o, here is my shortlist.” A “shortlist” (shortlist) is a list of possibilities,  usually a list of names for something that has been selected from a longer list. So, let’ s say that you are going to hire someone for your company – you’re going to find a n ew employee – and you interview 10 people. You then decide that three of these people might be good employees. Those three people then are on your “sho rtlist.” The shortlist is the final list of possibilities from which you make a s election, from which you pick what you want.

In this case, it’s a shortlist of names that Celest e and Albert are going to give their child. Albert asks, however, “A shortlist for  what?” He doesn’t know what Celeste is talking about, which is very common amon g husbands, I should add. Celeste says, “Baby names.” Albert says, “We have t he months to decide,” meaning we don’t have to decide this right now. “Do n’t you think we should wait?” he asks. Celeste says, “No, I want to be pre pared.” I want to be ready. “Here, take a look,” she says, meaning look at it. “See what you think,” she adds.

Albert immediately doesn’t like one of the names on  this shortlist. He says, “Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekiel?” “To  name a child” is to give the child a name. The verb “to name” means to give some one a certain name. “Name” can be a noun and a verb. Albert doesn’t see m to like the name Ezekiel.

He says, “He’ll be teased by every kid in school.” The “he” here is the baby. “To be teased” (teased) means to be made fun of.

The verb “to tease” means to make fun of someone – to do something or say something that will make other people laugh at a pe rson, or perhaps will make the other person not feel very good about himself. That’s often the result of teasing. “To tease,” however is usually a verb that  means not to be mean to someone, but simply to have fun with someone by mak ing a joke about that person. Children often tease other children – make fun of other children – if a child is different in some way, perhaps. Albert is worried that his child will be teased by the other children because of his name.

It’s not uncommon for children to tease other child ren by making fun of their names. That happened in my family all the time. My name is “Jeffrey Lawrence,” and if you put the initials – the first letters of those two words together – you get “J. L.” Well, “J. L.,” if you say it fast, sounds l ike the word “jail” (jail). So, my brothers and sisters would tease me by saying, “Jai l. You’re going to go to jail.” You know, stupid things like that. Don’t worry, I’m  – I’m over it. It no longer bothers me. The psychological counseling has taken care of it.

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Celeste says, “It’s a  family name,” meaning Ezekiel is a name that other people in Celeste’s fa mily have had. People often name their children using names from their family –  that their grandfather had or that some other relative or member of the family ha s had. Celeste says, “I was trying to appease my parents.” “To appease” (appeas e) normally means to try to make someone happy who is otherwise upset or angry – to do something that will stop the person from being angry.

Celeste perhaps thinks that her parents will be ang ry if she doesn’t name her child after one of the members of Celeste’s family.  “To name after” means to give someone the same name as someone else. For example,  my brother Frank, or Francis, was named after my grandfather, who also h ad the name Francis. “To be named after” means to give someone the same name  as someone else. It could be someone in your family. It could be someon e famous, someone that perhaps your parents like – an actor or a poet or t he postman, the guy who delivers your mail. Who knows?

Celeste says she was trying to appease her parents by giving the baby the family name of Ezekiel. She says, “They’ve been suggesting  a lot of family names.” “They” here means her parents. “We could call him b y a nickname, maybe ‘Zeke.’” A “nickname” (nickname) is an informal nam e that you use instead of your full name. Sometimes it’s a shorter version of  your full name. Someone

whose name is Christopher might be called “Chris” f or short, or Jeffrey might be called “Jeff.”

Nicknames can also be unrelated to your name. When I was in grade school, I was one of the shortest kids in my class, and so I was called “Shorty” (Shorty). I was also one of the dumbest kids in my class, so th ey could have called me something a lot worse, believe me. Celeste is sugge sting that even though “Ezekiel” might not be a name that Albert likes, th ey could call the baby “Zeke” as a nickname, which sounds a lot better to them.

Albert, however, says, “I’m not naming my child Eze kiel. His name would be Ezekiel Eckleman.” Obviously, Albert and Celeste’s last name is Eckleman. “That’s a mouthful,” Albert says. When someone says  something is a “mouthful” (mouthful), he means it’s a lot of things to say or  it’s difficult to say. If a word is very long or difficult to say, something like “anti disestablishmentarianism” – no, I won’t explain what that is – that’s a “mouthful.” I t’s difficult to say.

Albert says, “I also want to steer clear of alliter ative names.” “To steer (steer) clear (clear) of” something means to avoid doing so mething or not to go near something. If you and your friend don’t agree about  politics, you may “steer clear of politics” when you talk to each other. You avoid  that topic. Albert wants to steer clear of “alliterative” (alliterative) names.  “Alliterative” refers to words that begin with the same letter or sound.

So, “Jeff Johnson” is alliterative because both wor ds begin with J – the “J” sound. “Ezekiel Eckleman” is alliterative because both wor ds begin with the same sound. Celeste says, “Okay, are there any names you  like on my list?” Albert says, “Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.” He selec ts another name, actually a first name and a middle name, that he doesn’t like.

Celeste says, “Why not? I thought we’d name the bab y after my grandfather.” Again, “to name after” means to give him the same n ame as another person. “Alan is a nice first name and Philip is a nice mid dle name.” My first name, as I mentioned, is Jeffrey, legally. That’s the name tha t I have on my official documents. My middle name is Lawrence. Not everyone  in the United States has a middle name, a second name. Many people just have  a first name and a last name. But I still think most people have middle nam es.

Celeste wants to give their baby the middle name of  Phillip. But Albert says that if they give their child the name Alan Phillip, “his i nitials would be A.P.E. – ‘ape.’” “Initials” are the first letters of words. I mentio ned how my initials of my first two names are J. L. Well, the child, if he’s given the name of Alan Phillip would have

the initials A.P.E., which spells out the word “ape .” “Ape” is an animal similar to a monkey, and perhaps not something that you would wa nt to be called.

In fact, Albert says that the baby, the child, “wou ld never live that down.” “To never live something down” means that people will n ever forget about something that was bad or embarrassing about you. Celeste the n suggests a different name, which is “Mikol” (Mikol). This is not the nor mal way of spelling “Michael,” and Albert, I think for good reason, doesn’t like t hat idea either. He says, “You mean an alternate spelling for ‘Michael?’” “Alterna te (alternate) spelling” would be a different way of spelling a name.

My name, “Jeffrey,” can also be spelled (Geoffrey),  in addition to (Jeffrey), which is the way I spell it. Albert says, “People don’t k now how to pronounce a name with an odd (odd) spelling.” “Odd” means unusual or  unexpected. And it’s usually used to describe something that’s unusual in a bad way. Nowadays you see many odd spellings of names in English, I suppose. Parents want to be different. They want their child to be unique, to be unlike an yone else, or maybe the parents were just drinking very heavily when they d ecided on the name. That’s my personal theory.

Anyway, let’s finish our dialogue. Celeste says, “W ell, are there any names you do like?” Albert says, “Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.” If a boy has the same name as his father – the same first, middl e, and last names as his father – usually we add the word “junior” at the en d of the name so that you can tell the difference or you know the difference betw een the father and the son.

My father’s name was Patrick Dean McQuillan. He nam ed one of my brothers Patrick Dean McQuillan, and so my brother’s name is  Patrick Dean McQuillan Junior. When this happens, the father will often ad d the word “senior” to his name. So my father became Patrick Dean McQuillan Se nior. Now, you may be thinking what happens if my brother names his male child, his boy, Patrick Dean McQuillan? Well, he becomes Patrick Dean McQuillan III. And in fact, I have a nephew named Patrick Dean McQuillan III.

What happens if the Patrick Dean McQuillan III name s his child Patrick Dean McQuillan? Well, he would become Patrick Dean McQui llan IV, and so on. Now, my nephew did not name his child Patrick Dean McQui llan IV. Strangely, he did name him Patrick McQuillan, but the middle name is different. His middle name is Truman, which is a very unusual name. It’s actually  the last name, you may know, of one of our American presidents, Harry Trum an. He was named after Harry Truman – that is to say, his middle name.

 There is a tradition in the United States of giving  someone a middle name that is normally a last name when you are naming them after  someone. One of the most famous Americans of the late nineteenth, early twen tieth centuries was George Washington Carver. George Washington, of course, wa s the first president of the United States. George Washington Carver’s middle na me was Washington, just as my great nephew’s middle name is Truman.

Okay, I know, the dialogue – let’s finish. “Albert Eckleman Junior,” Albert says, “has a nice ring (ring) to it.” When you say someth ing “has a nice ring to it,” you mean it sounds nice. It sounds pleasant. It sounds good to you. Celeste, however, isn’t very happy with Albert’s solution he re of naming the baby boy after himself. Celeste says, “As you say, we have months to decide. Let’s keep an open mind.” “To keep an open mind” means to not mak e a decision yet. Albert isn’t very happy with that. He says “Humph!” He’s n ot happy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue – finally – at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: So, here is my shortlist.

Albert: A shortlist for what?

Celeste: Baby names.

Albert: We have months to decide. Don’t you think w e should wait?

Celeste: No, I want to be prepared. Here, take a lo ok. See what you think.

Albert: Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekie l? He’ll be teased by every kid in school.

Celeste: It’s a family name. I was trying to appeas e my parents. They’ve been suggesting a lot of family names. We could call him  by a nickname, maybe “Zeke.”

Albert: I’m not naming my child Ezekiel. His name w ould be Ezekiel Eckleman. That’s a mouthful. I also want to steer clear of al literative names. I’ve never liked them.

Celeste: Okay, are there any names you like on my l ist?

 Albert: Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.

Celeste: Why not? I thought we’d name the baby afte r my grandfather. Alan is a nice first name and Phillip is a nice middle name.

Albert: His initials would be “A.P.E.” – ape! He wo uld never live that down.

Celeste: How about “Mikol”?

Albert: You mean an alternate spelling for “Michael ”? People don’t know how to pronounce a name with an odd spelling.

Celeste: Well, are there any names you do like?

Albert: Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.

Celeste: As you say, we have months to decide. Let’ s keep an open mind.

Albert: Humph!

# Cancelling a Service

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,171 – Cancelling a Service.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e about someone who no longer wants a certain kind of service. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Diana: You’ve reached customer service for Bully Se rvices. How may I help you today?

Phillip: I’d like to cancel my service.

Diana: Why do you want to cancel?

Phillip: I’m switching to another company with chea per services. I’m no longer under contract, so there should be no early-termina tion penalties.

Diana: Let’s take a look at your account. I’m sure we can make you an offer so you won’t want to discontinue service.

Phillip: I’ve made up my mind. I just want to cance l.

Diana: As a customer service rep, it’s my job to fi nd a way to retain you as a valued customer. Please bear with me, sir.

Phillip: Really, I’m not interested in any offers y ou can make. No high-pressure tactics are going to work with me, so please just c ancel my service.

Diana: Please, sir, be reasonable. I’m trying to wo rk with you so you won’t miss out on our great deals. If you sign a new two-year contract or set up auto-pay, I can offer you . . .

Phillip: I’m not interested. I want to cancel – now !

Diana: Just let me tell you about these three plans  that are available to you at a lower price. I know that deep down you don’t really  want to cancel your service.

Phillip: I do want to cancel my service and I want to do it right now!

Diana: Sir, please! You’re being a little pushy.

Phillip: I’m being a little pushy?!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Cancelling a Service.” A “s ervice” is anything that someone does for you – in this dialogue, what a bus iness does for you. You can buy a service or you can buy a product from a compa ny. A “product” is a thing that you buy. A “service” is something that someone  does for you. For example, we talk about “phone service.” The telephone compan y provides you with the service. It does something for you. It connects you r telephone to other people’s telephones. You could also have “television service ,” “cable TV service,” where a company provides television stations to your TV so you can watch them.

Today, we’re talking about cancelling a service, me aning to decide to stop getting a certain service. The dialogue begins with Diana s aying to Phillip, “You’ve reached customer service for Bully Services. How ma y I help you?” Diana works for this company, oddly called the Bully Services. She is part of the “customer service” department.

The “customer” is the person who buys something fro m a company. “Customer service” is the part of the company that takes care  of problems that a customer may have. That’s the service that customer service provides. Phillip says to Diana, “I want to cancel my service.” “To cancel” ( cancel) is to end something, especially a service like, well, whatever it is tha t Bully Services provides Phillip.

Diana says, “Why do you want to cancel?” Phillip sa ys, “I’m switching to another company with cheaper services.” “To switch (switch)  to” something or someone means to stop using one person or one company and u se another person or company instead. You could switch products as well.  I used to drink Starbucks

coffee, and now I drink Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. I’m switching the kind of coffee I drink. I’m switching to Dunkin’ Donuts. Dunkin’ Don uts is a company that makes donuts, but also coffee.

Well, in this example, Phillip is switching to anot her company that provides cheaper or less expensive services. “I’m no longer under contract so there should be no early-termination penalties,” he says.  “To be under contract” means that you have signed a legal agreement called a “co ntract” (contract) and you are required, with this contract, to do something for a  certain amount of time.

For example, if you buy a phone in the United State s, it’s quite common for some companies to give you a discounted price, a cheaper  price, if you also sign a two- year contract with that phone company. During those  two years, you must pay your bills. You must get your telephone service fro m that company. That’s called being “under contract.” After the end of two years,  you are no longer under contract. That’s what Phillip is referring to here.  Although we’re not sure this is about phone service.

He says, “I’m no longer under contract so there sho uld be no early-termination penalties.” The word “termination” comes from the v erb “to terminate,” which means to end. You may remember the famous movie cal led Terminator . Well, a “terminator” is a person who terminate someone’s li fe, ends someone’s life. Here, we’re talking about “termination” as a noun in the expression, or term, “early termination.” “Early termination” means you end you r contract. You cancel your contract before it’s over.

Now, when you do that – say, for telephone service – you usually have to pay the company a “penalty” (penalty). A penalty is some so rt of fee, some amount of money you have to pay because you ended the contrac t early. So, an “early- termination penalty” is money you have to pay the c ompany for canceling or terminating your contract before the end of the con tract period.

Why do you have to pay a penalty? Well, because you  no longer are going to be paying the company what you said you would pay unde r the contract. So, the company wants to get at least some money back, and it does that by putting a penalty into the contract itself. You agree to pay a penalty if you terminate the contract or cancel the contract early. Diana says, “Let’s take a look at your account.” An “account” (account) here refers to a l ist or record of all the interactions or transactions between you and the co mpany. It’s going to be something the company has in its computers.

Diana says, “I’m sure we can make you an offer so y ou won’t want to discontinue service.” When you try to cancel your telephone ser vice or your cable television service, sometimes the company will try to persuade  you not to do it. Diana says, “I’m sure we can make you an offer,” meaning we can  give something to you, “so that you won’t want to discontinue (discontinue) se rvice.” “To discontinue” means the same as to cancel or to terminate service.

However, Phillip says, “I’ve made up my mind. I jus t want to cancel.” “To make up your mind” means to decide, especially after you  have given a lot of thought to something, after you’ve thought about something for  a long time. Diana says, “As a customer service rep” – (rep), meaning “represent ative” – “it’s my job to find a way to retain you as a valued customer.” “To retain ” (retain) here means to keep or to continue to have you as a customer.

She then says, “Please bear with me, sir.” “To bear  (bear) with” someone means to be patient with someone, especially if someone i s taking a long time to do something. Phillip is not interested in being patie nt. He says, “Really, I’m not interested in any offers you can make. No high-pres sure tactics are going to work with me, so please just cancel my service.” “High-p ressure tactics” would be things that a company does or a salesperson does th at make it difficult for you to say no.

A “high-pressure tactic” would include things that may sort of force you to do something because of the way the person is talking to you or because of what the person is trying to give you. If you go to a st ore and the salesperson comes up to you and is trying to give you things and says , “Here’s a free sample. Try this. Oh, no, you should try this,” the person is a lmost trying to force you to buy something. That might be considered an example of a  high-pressure tactic in sales.

But Diana says, “Please, sir, be reasonable.” “To b e reasonable” (reasonable) means to be logical, to be rational, or to be fair.  She says, “I’m trying to work with you so you won’t miss out on our great deals. If yo u sign a new two-year contract or set up auto-pay, I can offer you . . .” And then  Phillip says, “I’m not interested. I want to cancel – now!”

“Auto-pay” is when a company automatically takes mo ney out of your bank each month or each year for the bill, for the money you owe that company for whatever service the company is providing. That’s called “au to-pay.” “Auto” (auto) comes from the word “automatic.” It happens every month o r every six months or every year without you having to do anything extra. Diana  says, “Just let me tell you about these three plans that are available to you a t a lower price.”

 She’s still trying to get Phillip to continue his s ervice with this company. She says, “I know that deep down you don’t really want to cancel your service.” The expression “deep (deep) down” means your true emoti ons, refers to your deepest feelings, your real desires. Perhaps there are thin gs that you don’t say or don’t talk about, but deep down you really believe or you  really feel. You may say to someone you’re happy, but deep down you’re sad. “De ep down” refers to your true feelings or your true thoughts or your true de sires.

Phillip says, “I do want to cancel my service and I  want to do it right now” – that is, immediately. Diana says, “Sir, please! You’re b eing a little pushy.” “To be pushy” (pushy) means to be overly demanding, to ins ist that you get your way, that you get what you want. It’s a negative way of describing someone.

Now of course, Phillip here thinks that Diana is be ing pushy by trying to get him to renew or to continue his service with this compa ny instead of simply canceling his service, which is what he requested. That’s why  at the end of the dialogue, he’s surprised. He says, “I’m being a little pushy? !” He says it as though it were a question, but really he’s showing that he is surpri sed that Diana is saying this to him because she is the one who’s being pushy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Diana: You’ve reached customer service for Bully Se rvices. How may I help you today?

Phillip: I’d like to cancel my service.

Diana: Why do you want to cancel?

Phillip: I’m switching to another company with chea per services. I’m no longer under contract, so there should be no early-termina tion penalties.

Diana: Let’s take a look at your account. I’m sure we can make you an offer so you won’t want to discontinue service.

Phillip: I’ve made up my mind. I just want to cance l.

Diana: As a customer service rep, it’s my job to fi nd a way to retain you as a valued customer. Please bear with me, sir.

 Phillip: Really, I’m not interested in any offers y ou can make. No high-pressure tactics are going to work with me, so please just c ancel my service.

Diana: Please, sir, be reasonable. I’m trying to wo rk with you so you won’t miss out on our great deals. If you sign a new two-year contract or set up auto-pay, I can offer you . . .

Phillip: I’m not interested. I want to cancel – now !

Diana: Just let me tell you about these three plans  that are available to you at a lower price. I know that deep down you don’t really  want to cancel your service.

Phillip: I do want to cancel my service and I want to do it right now!

Diana: Sir, please! You’re being a little pushy.

Phillip: I’m being a little pushy?!

# Booking Space for Business Events

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,172 – Booking Space for Business Events.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,172. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is going to talk about getting a room,  a space, for having a meeting – a business event. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, we have to find meeting rooms a nd a banquet hall for the annual sales meeting and luncheon. Do you have any ideas?

Nicole: We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done i n past years, or we can try the convention center.

Roberto: The company has grown so much in the past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need. The convention cent er sounds like a better option.

Nicole: The advantage of the hotel is that it has i n-house catering and waitstaff for the luncheon.

Roberto: Yes, but we can bring in outside catering,  which would give us more food options. The large convention center rooms wil l also allow us to configure the space the way we want it.

Nicole: But the hotel meeting rooms have built-in A /V. I’m not sure that’s available at the convention center.

Roberto: All right, I think we should visit both ve nues and book after we’ve met with the event managers. Agreed?

Nicole: Agreed. And we’ll need to sample the cateri ng options, right?

Roberto: Of course. What are expense accounts for?

[end of dialogue]

Roberto begins our dialogue by saying to Nicole, “A ll right, we have to find meeting rooms and a banquet hall for the annual sal es meeting and luncheon.” A “meeting room” is a large room – usually at a hotel  or perhaps at a place called a “convention center,” which we’ll talk about in a mi nute – in which you can have a meeting. Meeting rooms are often used by organizati ons and companies that don’t have their own space to have a room, or when you have too many people for your own offices.

A “banquet” (banquet) is a large meal for many peop le. A “banquet hall” (hall) is a large room in which you can have your meals. Now, w hat’s the difference between a “banquet hall” and a “meeting room?” Well , a meeting room isn’t really designed for eating in, whereas a banquet hall is. You could have a banquet hall at a large restaurant or a banquet room at a large restaurant. The word “hall” (hall) refers to a very large space, a very large r oom, one that might have five hundred people or a thousand people in it.

A “luncheon” (luncheon) is a formal lunch, usually for a large number of people. So, Roberto is looking for a place that has meeting  rooms, and perhaps also a banquet hall “for the annual” – that is, every year  – “sales meeting and luncheon.” “Do you have any ideas?” he asks Nicole.  Nicole says, “We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done in past years.”

“To hold (hold) an event” means to have a large mee ting or a large event in a certain place. “We’re going to hold our wedding rec eption in a hotel.” We’re going to have it in a hotel. A “wedding reception” is a p arty that you have after the wedding. Many large hotels have meeting rooms and b anquet halls in which you can have your meetings and banquets. Nicole suggest s going to a hotel or trying a convention center.

The word “convention” (convention) here refers to a  large meeting about some topic in which everyone who goes to the meeting is interested in. A convention usually has many meetings about the same topic. A “ convention center” is a large building that is built just for conventions. Many large cities in the U.S. have convention centers. Los Angeles has a convention ce nter. These convention centers are often so large you could have several c onventions at the same time because they have so much room in them.

 Roberto says, “The company has grown so much in the  past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need.” “Capacity” (ca pacity) here refers to the number of people that you could put in a room or in  a building. If you have a very large convention or large meeting, you need rooms t hat have a very large capacity. Roberto suggests that a convention center  is a better option, a better idea.

Nicole says, however, that “the advantage of the ho tel is that it has in-house catering and waitstaff for the luncheon.” The expre ssion “in-house” refers to something that is done within the same business. So , for example, a large company might have an “in-house legal department.” They don’t go to lawyers who work for themselves or for another company. The y have their own lawyers.

Hotels often have “in-house catering” (catering). “ Catering” refers to preparing and serving food at a lunch or a dinner, say. “In-h ouse catering,” then, refers to the ability of a hotel to provide the food without having to go to a restaurant or to another business in order to provide that service. A hotel also often has its own “waitstaff” (waitstaff). “Waitstaff” refers to wait ers and waitresses – people who bring you the food or who take your orders at a res taurant.

Roberto says, “Yes, but we can bring in outside cat ering.” Nicole is talking about the advantages of a hotel having in-house catering and waitstaff. Roberto is talking about using a convention center. But when y ou use a convention center, usually you have to get another company outside of the convention center to bring the food in and serve it. That’s what he mean s by “outside catering” – outside the convention center, people who don’t wor k for the convention center, in effect.

Roberto says that if they do that, if they use outs ide catering, they will have “more food options,” more choices. “The large conve ntion center rooms will also allow us to configure the space the way we want it, ” Roberto says. “To configure” (configure) means to arrange something in a particu lar way or in a certain way so that it does what you want it to do. You could conf igure your phone so that it doesn’t ring after a certain time at night. You can  configure a room so that it will have enough chairs and tables for everyone in your meeting.

Roberto thinks that the convention centers will hav e large rooms that will allow the company to configure the space – the area, the room – the way it wants it. Nicole, however, says that “hotel meeting rooms hav e built-in A/V.” “A/V” refers to “audiovisual.” It refers to the kind of equipmen t that you would use to make a presentation to a large group of people. It might r efer to the sound system,

including microphones and speakers. It might refer to a screen on which you can put information or project images – all of that wou ld be included in A/V.

Convention centers often provide A/V services, but not all of the rooms may have the A/V. They may have to bring audiovisual equipme nt in, in order to do what you want to do. Hotel meeting rooms nowadays in man y cases have built-in A/V. “Built (built) – in (in)” refers to equipment that is permanently in the room. It’s there all the time. You don’t have to bring it in f rom another room. Nicole says, “I’m not sure that built-in A/V is available at the  convention center.”

Roberto then says, “All right,” (he likes to say “a ll right” – this is the second time he’s said it) “I think we should visit both venues and book after we’ve met with the event managers. Agreed?” A “venue” (venue) is a  place where a certain event happens. It’s just another term for a place, but usually it refers to a place for a specific event. So, a bar could be a venue for a small musical group to play music, or a large stadium could be a venue for a mu sical group to play its music.

Anything, really, can be a venue as long as an even t can take place there. “To book” (book) is the same as “to reserve.” It means to say, “Yes, we’re going to use this space,” or this venue. Usually, it require s signing a contract with the hotel or the convention center and then giving them  a certain percentage of the money in order for them to hold or to keep the spac e for you. That’s the meaning of the verb “to book.” It’s the same as “to reserve .” You can book a hotel room, for example, for your trip.

An “event manager” is a person at a hotel or conven tion center whose job it is to help you make the reservation and to take care of a ll of the planning details that are required for you to hold your event. Roberto is  suggesting that he and Nicole go and visit these venues, these places, talk to the event managers, and then book a space. Nicole says, “Agreed. And we’ll need to sample the catering options, right?” “To sample” (sample) means to try something before you buy it.

Many times when you go to a hotel, especially for a  wedding reception, the hotel will give you samples of the food that you can tast e so you can decide whether you like it or not. To be honest, this doesn’t happ en all that often with meeting rooms at a hotel or a convention center. I’ve booke d many conferences and meetings at hotels and convention centers and I’ve never sampled the food, but in the dialogue, Roberto and Nicole are going to be  able to do that.

Nicole says that she and Roberto will need to sampl e the catering options. They’ll need to try the food to make sure they like it. Rob erto says, “Of course. What are expense accounts for?” An “expense (expense) accoun t” is an amount of money

that a company gives an employee to do things that are necessary for the company, that are outside of the company offices, t ypically. So, if the company is sending you on a trip, you will get money from the company to pay for that trip. That’s part of your expense account.

I guess in this case Nicole and Roberto are going t o be traveling to the hotel or to the convention center, and the expense account will  pay for the travel to these places. The samples, however, are usually provided free by the catering departments of a hotel or a caterer that might serv ice a convention center, so I don’t think that’s what they’re referring to here. It must be the travel that they will have to undergo, or take, in order to get to these venues.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, we have to find meeting rooms a nd a banquet hall for the annual sales meeting and luncheon. Do you have any ideas?

Nicole: We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done i n past years or we can try the convention center.

Roberto: The company has grown so much in the past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need. The convention cent er sounds like a better option.

# Flying on a Budget Airline

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,173 – Flying on a Budget Airline.

In this episode, we’re going to talk about flying i n an airplane that doesn’t cost very much money. There are some good things about t hat and, well, some not- so-good things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: It’s amazing that we were able to get these airline tickets so cheaply.

Federica: It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawre nce City for a fun weekend. Let’s check in using this kiosk.

Anton: Hmm, this is asking me to pay $50 to bring a  piece of luggage aboard. I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restrict ions.

Federica: I didn’t realize it either.

Anton: And we have to pay another fee to reserve a seat. I didn’t know that the default was open seating.

Federica: Me, neither.

Anton: Did you know that we’re not flying directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?

Federica: Oh, no!

Anton: And there are other hidden fees for what the y consider add-ons, things we would normally get for free on other airlines, like  a soda, snack, blanket, and in- flight entertainment?

Federica: No, that’s news to me.

Anton: Here’s the kicker. We’re not flying into Law rence City Airport but to a remote airport 60 miles away. We’ll pay a lot for g round transportation to our hotel. Should we get a refund and forget about the trip?

Federica: Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed.

Anton: I should have known flying on a budget airli ne would be like this. It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?

Federica: No, this airline has turned nickel-and-di ming into an art form!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue is called “Flying on a Budget (budget)  Airline.” Something that is “budget” is something that is cheap. So, this is an  airline – a company that uses airplanes to fly you from one place to another – th at doesn’t cost very much money. Well, we find out in our dialogue that that isn’t always a good thing. Anton begins by saying, “It’s amazing that we were able t o get these airline tickets so cheaply.” Federica says, “It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawrence City for a fun weekend.” I’m not sure where Lawrence City is exact ly, but it sounds like it’s a great place.

Federica says, “Let’s check in using this kiosk.” “ To check in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to report for your flight or reservati on – letting the company or someone know that you are ready to go or that you a re going to be using this particular service. If you fly, “checking in” usual ly can be done either on your computer 24 hours before you fly or at the airport.  It’s telling the airline that you are there and you are going to be taking this fligh t. Well, it doesn’t exactly say that you’re there if you check in online, but it sa ys you will be there and you will be going on the airplane.

You can also check in at a hotel if you have a rese rvation. You call the hotel and tell them you want a room. Then when you arrive at the hotel, you can check in. You can say, “Yes, I’m here. Please give me my key. ” A “kiosk” (kiosk) is a small

structure that could just provide information, but at an airport is used to check in. You are able to give the computer the information a bout your flight, and usually the kiosk machine can give you your boarding pass, which is a piece of paper you need to get onto the airplane.

Federica suggests to Anton that they check in using  the kiosk. Now, it is still possible in most American airports to check in talk ing to a real live human being rather than using a machine like a kiosk. Anton say s, “Hmm, this,” meaning the kiosk, “is asking me to pay $50 to bring a piece of  luggage aboard.”

A piece of luggage is something like a suitcase or a briefcase. “Aboard” means on the airplane with you. You can either take your luggage with you as you get on the airplane, or you can give it to the airline and they will put it down on the bottom of the airplane and then you pick it up agai n when you arrive. That’s called “checking your luggage.” Anton says that thi s particular airline is going to charge him $50 dollars to bring a piece of luggage aboard.

“I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restr ictions,” Anton says. “Baggage” (baggage) is another word for “luggage.” “Restrictions” are rules and limitations, usually, that prevent you from doing c ertain things. In this case, the baggage restrictions for the airline say that if yo u want to bring a piece of luggage aboard, you have to pay $50, which is an awful lot of money. Federica says, “I didn’t realize it either.”

Anton continues, “And we have to pay another fee” –  that is, more money – “to reserve a seat.” “To reserve” means to make arrange ments to do something in advance. “To reserve a seat on an airplane” means t o select your seat so that when you get on the airplane, that seat is already yours – no one else can sit there. Anton says, “I didn’t know that the default was open seating.” The “default” (default) of something is the normal way that this works or the normal way that something happens.

In this case, the normal way that things happen on the airplane is “open seating.” Open seating is a system where there are no seats t hat are reserved, or we might also say “assigned (assigned) to someone.” Ev eryone just gets on the airplane and the first person who gets on gets to p ick the best seat, and so forth. No one has a reserved or assigned seat. Federica, a gain, didn’t realize this either.

Then Anton asks, “Did you know that we’re not flyin g directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?” “To fly directly”  somewhere means to go from one city to another without stopping at a third cit y to get there. For example, if

you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City, y ou can fly directly, meaning your plane will go up in the air in Los Angeles and  come down in New York City. You could also have what are called “stopovers,” or  simply “stops.” These would be places where you stop in between where you’re co ming from and where you want to end up.

So you might make a stop in Denver, or in Minneapol is, or in Detroit, or in a number of other cities in between Los Angeles and N ew York. “To fly directly,” then, means that you don’t make any stops. You don’ t have what are called “layovers” (layovers). Federica wasn’t aware of thi s either. She didn’t know they were going to be making two stops in order to get t o Lawrence City.

Anton says, “And there are other hidden fees for wh at they consider add-ons.” A “hidden (hidden) fee” is money you have to pay that  you didn’t realize you had to pay, usually because the company doesn’t tell you d irectly. An “add-on” would be something additional or something that the company considers additional – things that are not included in, in this case, your  airline ticket.

Anton gives a list of some of these add-ons that he  and Federica will have to pay extra for – things that normally you get free on an  airplane such as soda, snacks, a blanket, and in-flight entertainment. “In-flight”  means while you are flying, while you are traveling. “In-flight entertainment” would be things such as TV shows, music, perhaps movies that the airline would in man y cases give you for free, although many U.S. airlines no longer do this. Fede rica was also ignorant of this. She says, “No, that’s news to me,” meaning “No, I d idn’t know that either.”

Then Anton says, “Here’s the kicker.” A “kicker” (k icker) is an unexpected piece of news, an unpleasant piece of information – somet hing that you didn’t expect. Anton says, “We’re not flying into Lawrence City Ai rport, but to a remote airport 60 miles away.” A “remote (remote) airport” would b e an airport that is at a great distance from the place where you plan on visiting.

“We’ll pay a lot for ground transportation to our h otel,” Anton says. “Ground transportation” refers to the way or the means of t ransportation you use to get from the airport to your, say, hotel. This could in clude taxis, buses, trams, shuttles, subways, and so forth – anything that goe s from the airport to where you want to go such as a hotel. Now that Anton know s about all these additional costs, he asks Federica, “Should we get a refund an d forget about the trip?”

A “refund” is when a company gives you your money b ack for something you’ve already paid for. Federica says, “Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed,” meaning the airline wi ll not give you your money

back if you cancel, if you decide not to go on your  trip. Anton says, “I should have known flying on a budget airline would be like this . It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?”

The expression “I should have known” means had I be en more intelligent, or had I thought about it more, I would have realized that  this was the case – that, in this case, budget airlines are not always a good deal, m eaning they’re not always cheap, because they have all these additional fees and expenses.

Federica says, “No, this airline has turned nickel- and-diming into an art form!” A “nickel” (nickel) in U.S. English refers to a five- cent coin – a coin worth five pennies, basically. A “dime” is a coin worth ten ce nts. The verb “to nickel-and- dime” means to charge people lots of little fees, s mall fees for all sorts of things. You don’t say, “Well, the price is this much and in cludes everything.” Instead, you give the person a low price, but then you charge th em for everything that the person may normally expect to be free.

This is what airlines do nowadays, at least in the U.S. It used to be that you got a free meal on an airplane when you flew from one cit y to another in the U.S. Nowadays, you have to pay for it. That’s an example  of what some people would consider nickel-and-diming you – to charge you for every little thing.

Frederica says the airline “has turned nickel-and-d iming into an art form.” “To turn it into” something means to make it into somet hing. An “art form” here refers to anything that requires creativity. Federica is j oking here. She doesn’t mean that the airline is actually doing something artist ic when it charges you for all of these small services and products. “To turn somethi ng into an art form” here means simply that the airline has become very creat ive in taking your money.

Now, let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: It’s amazing that we were able to get these airline tickets so cheaply.

Federica: It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawre nce City for a fun weekend. Let’s check in using this kiosk.

Anton: Hmm, this is asking me to pay $50 to bring a  piece of luggage aboard. I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restrict ions.

Federica: I didn’t realize it either.

 Anton: And we have to pay another fee to reserve a seat. I didn’t know that the default was open seating.

Federica: Me, neither.

Anton: Did you know that we’re not flying directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?

Federica: Oh, no!

Anton: And there are other hidden fees for what the y consider add-ons, things we would normally get for free on other airlines, like  a soda, snack, blanket, and in- flight entertainment?

Federica: No, that’s news to me.

Anton: Here’s the kicker. We’re not flying into Law rence City Airport but to a remote airport 60 miles away. We’ll pay a lot for g round transportation to our hotel. Should we get a refund and forget about the trip?

Federica: Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed.

Anton: I should have known flying on a budget airli ne would be like this. It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?

Federica: No, this airline has turned nickel-and-di ming into an art form!

This episode is a dialogue between Amelia and Victo r about how we describe the quality of video, such as what you watch on televis ion or perhaps on your computer. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amelia: I wish we had hired a professional videogra pher to film it instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.

Victor: This video isn’t so bad. The production qua lity isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.

Amelia: It’s not bad if you like your video out of focus. There are no transitions between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At bes t, it looks like a rough cut.

Victor: It is a little rough, I admit.

Amelia: There are problems with the audio, too. The re are sections of dead air when the audio cuts out. And when there is audio, t he volume isn’t uniform.

Victor: That’s true, too, I guess . . .

Amelia: And the handheld camera footage is so shaky  that I feel ill watching it.

Victor: Lenny was just having a good time, getting into the spirit of it.

Amelia: Is that why he got close-up shots of all of  the pretty women and none of the other guests?

Victor: Well, you know Lenny. He’ll do better next time.

 Amelia: Next time?! How many times do you plan to g et married?

[end of dialogue]

Amelia begins our dialogue by saying, “I wish we ha d hired a professional videographer to film it instead of asking your frie nd Lenny to do it.” Amelia mentions a “professional videographer” (videographe r). A videographer is a person whose job it is to make movies of certain sp ecial events – to film special events such as birthdays, but more typically someth ing such as a wedding, which is what we’re talking about in this dialogue.

Amelia and Victor asked Victor’s friend Lenny to fi lm their wedding instead of getting someone who was a professional – someone wh o knew what he was doing, basically. Notice, “videographer” is like the word “photographer.” A photographer is someone who takes photos, what we w ould now call “stills” or “still photos.” A videographer is someone who makes  or films video.

Victor says, “This video isn’t so bad,” meaning it’ s not as bad as Amelia says it is. “The production quality isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.” “Production quality” refers to how professional a video looks, whether it looks like it was done by someone who knew what he was doing. Victor think s his friend Lenny did a pretty good job, which means not the best job, but not a terrible job either.

Amelia doesn’t agree. She says, “It’s not bad if yo u like your video out of focus.” “Out of focus” means the same as “blurry” (blurry).  Something that is “blurry” or “out of focus” is something that you can’t see clea rly because the lens was not adjusted properly – the part of the camera that is responsible for making sure that the image is clear. The video is “out of focus .”

Amelia adds, “There are no transitions between scen es and the lighting is terrible.” A “scene” (scene) in a video is one part  or section of a video that is about the same topic or that is showing the same ar ea or people. A “transition” (transition) in a video is how you move or change f rom one scene to another. Sometimes in videos, the video will seem to move fr om right to left or top to bottom, or sometimes it will seem as though one sce ne magically fades away or goes away slowly and another one comes in slowly. T hese are called “transitions.”

Amelia says that their video doesn’t have any trans itions. In addition, the “lighting” (lighting) is terrible, meaning that you  can’t see properly. You can’t see things because there isn’t enough light or perhaps there’s too much light. “At

best,” Amelia says,” it looks like a rough cut. The  term “rough cut” (cut) refers to the first draft or the first attempt at editing a v ideo.

If someone makes a video of, say, a wedding, he may  sit down at his computer and put different parts of the wedding footage, or the things that he filmed, together, but it isn’t perfect yet. It’s only his f irst attempt to try to put the different parts of the wedding video together so that it look s good. That first attempt would be a “rough cut.” The opposite of a “rough cut” wou ld be a “final cut.” This is when you’re all done – when you finish doing all the editing on the video.

Victor says, “It is a little rough, I admit.” “Roug h” (rough) here means not perfect, still something that you’re working on. Amelia says , “There are problems with the audio, too.” The “audio” also has problems. The aud io is the sound, of course, of the video. “There are sections of dead air when the  audio cuts out.” “Dead air” (air) is when there is no sound, either on a radio or on a television program or in a video. This is when there is no sound, usually by  accident. There should be sound but there isn’t any.

To say the audio “cuts out” means that it stops sud denly. You are listening to some audio and then suddenly . . . and then you don ’t know what happened. That’s what we mean by the audio “cutting out.” “To  cut out” can also be used in other circumstances meaning simply to stop somethin g. “I’m going to cut out pizza and hot dogs from my diet.” I’m going to stop  eating them completely.

Amelia says, “And when there is audio, the volume i sn’t uniform.” The “volume” (volume) is how loud something is. “To be uniform” (uniform) here means to be constant or the same. If the volume isn’t uniform, sometimes it’s really loud and sometimes it’s what we would call really “soft.” Yo u can barely hear it. Victor says, “That’s true, too, I guess.”

Amelia isn’t finished with her problems, her compla ints. “And the handheld camera footage is so shaky that I feel ill watching  it.” “Handheld” (handheld) means, of course, that you are holding something in  your hand, such as a camera. “Footage” (footage) refers to part of a rec ording, part of the video. So, “handheld camera footage” would be part of the vide o that the person who was the videographer filmed not by using a special inst rument called a “tripod” to keep the camera still and steady, but rather by usi ng his hand and walking around with the video camera in his hand.

When you use a handheld camera, sometimes the foota ge is “shaky” (shaky). “Shaky” means that it’s not steady. It looks like t he camera is moving back and forth all the time, and so it’s hard to watch the v ideo because everything keeps

moving up and down and from side to side. Lenny, ac cording to Victor, “was just having a good time, getting into the spirit of it.”  “To get into the spirit” (spirit) of something means to get involved or interested in so mething in such a way that you are excited about it.

Amelia says, “Is that why he got close-up shots of all the pretty women and none of the other guests?” A “close-up shot” (shot) is w hen you bring the camera very close to someone’s, usually, face so that you can s ee them very, what we would say, “close-up” – very near. The term “close-up” us ed as a noun refers to when the camera is right next to a person’s face. You ca n see the face very clearly. Apparently Lenny has a close-up of all the pretty w omen at the wedding and nobody else.

Victor says, “Well, you know Lenny. He’ll do better  next time.” Amelia says, “Next time?! How many times do you plan to get married?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Amelia: I wish we had hired a professional videogra pher to film it instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.

Victor: This video isn’t so bad. The production qua lity isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.

Amelia: It’s not bad if you like your video out of focus. There are no transitions between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At bes t, it looks like a rough cut.

Take a look on our website for more information.

This dialogue is all about getting a fresh start – beginning your life anew. Well, let’s get started ourselves.

[start of dialogue]

Nico: I’ve moving to Atlanta. I want a fresh start.

Celia: This is a surprise. I thought you were going  to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.

Nico: There are too many reminders here. I want a c lean slate. What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminations.

Celia: I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beating your self up over what’s happened, but are you sure moving away will help you move on?

Nico: The world is my oyster now, isn’t it? I can l ive anywhere I want to and do anything I want to.

Celia: I guess so, but are you sure you want to upr oot and leave town?

Nico: I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m  going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town.

Celia: I guess a new town is a good place to start a new life, and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a dif ficult divorce.

Nico: I’ve sworn off women. The only female I want in my life right now is my dog, Fifi!

[end of dialogue]

We’re getting a fresh start on this episode – a new  opportunity to do things differently. Nico in the dialogue says he’s moving to Atlanta. Atlanta is a city in the state of Georgia, in the southeast part of the U.S. Nico says he wants “a fresh start.” Celia is surprised. In fact, she says, “Thi s is a surprise. I thought you were going to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.”

“To stick it out” means to continue to do something  even though it is difficult, even though it may be challenging. “To put the past  behind you” means to no longer worry about what happened before. It can als o mean, sometimes, to no longer do the bad things that you used to do. “To p ut the past behind you” means to focus on the future or on what you’re doing righ t now and no longer worry about what you did before. Celia thought that Nico was going to put the past behind him and stay here, wherever “here” is in our  dialogue.

But Nico says, “There are too many reminders here.”  A “reminder” (reminder) is something that makes you remember something. It cou ld be something you have to do now, or could be something that you did once many years ago or anytime in your past. That second meaning is what Nico is u sing here when he says, “There are too many reminders here.” He means there  are too many things that make him remember bad things that happened to him.

He says, “I want a clean slate” (slate). A “slate” is a kind of writing surface, something you write on. A “clean slate” would be a new starting point. It’s basically the same as a “fresh start.” “To have a c lean slate” means that you don’t worry about anything in the past. A clean sla te means you don’t worry about or don’t consider anything that has already b een done. Nico says, “What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminati ons.”

The expression “what’s done is done” is a somewhat unusual one, but basically it says, “I’m not going to worry about what has happen ed in the past because I can’t change it.” Although Shakespeare wasn’t the f irst person to use this expression, people often associate it with him beca use he uses it in his play, Macbeth . Lady Macbeth says, “What’s done is done,” and lat er she adds, “What’s done cannot be undone.” “To undo” something  would be to reverse something that has happened. And of course, you can ’t go back and change the past – what’s done is done.

Nico says he’s tired of “blame” (blame) and “recrim inations” (recriminations). “Blame” is the responsibility for doing something w rong. We usually use the expression “take the blame.” “I will take the blame ” means I will take responsibility; I will take the consequences of wha t has gone wrong here. “Recriminations” refer to what we call “accusations .” “To accuse” (accuse) someone is to say that someone did something wrong.  “Accusation” is the noun form, from the verb “to accuse.”

“Recriminations” are accusations that Person A make s against Person B after Person B has already made an accusation against Per son A. So for example, you say that I did something wrong, and I say, “Wel l, you did something wrong.” You see, I am accusing you of something after you h ave already accused me of doing something wrong.

Celia says, “I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beatin g yourself up over what’s happened.” “To beat yourself up” over something mea ns to criticize yourself too much – to be, we might say, “overly critical.” To b e unable to forgive yourself is to beat yourself up over something. Celia says, “Are y ou sure moving away will help you move on?” “To move on” means to no longer think  about something that has happened, something bad that has happened, and to p lan for the future.

Nico says, “The world is my oyster now, isn’t it?” The expression, “The world is my oyster” (oyster) means that you can do whatever you want. You have freedom, perhaps money, or other things that will a llow you to do whatever you want. Nico says, “I can live anywhere I want to and  do anything I want to.”

Celia says, “I guess so, but are you sure you want to uproot and leave town?” “To uproot” means to move yourself from one place t o a completely different place. We sometimes use that verb when you are not only moving, but you are breaking off your relationships from the place wher e you live now and going to a completely new place where you don’t know anyone.

Nico says, “I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town.” “To reinvent yourself ” would mean to change yourself significantly – to change your personality , perhaps, or to start acting in a way that is completely different from the way you a cted in the past. “To start over” means to begin again. It’s similar to having a fresh start. Nico says, “I might as well do it in a new town.” The phrase “might (mi ght) as well” is used to show that two different ideas are equal and there’s no r eally good reason to select one over the other. It doesn’t really matter.

For example, it’s four o’clock in the afternoon and  you’re working on a project, but in order to work more on the project, you need to talk to your boss. Your boss isn’t in the office, so you say, “Well, I might as well go home because I can’t do anything on this project until I talk to my boss.” Of course, if you’re supposed to stay at your work until five o’clock, your boss mig ht not be very happy that you left, but in your mind there wasn’t any advantage f or you to stay at your office because you couldn’t continue working on the projec t. So you chose another option, which was to go home.

Nico says he might as well start over in a new town . It won’t matter. Celia says, “I guess a new town is a good place to start a new lif e, and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a difficult divo rce.” “To bounce (bounce) back” from something means to recover from somethin g, to get your happiness back, or to perhaps get your physical health back. We could talk about someone “bouncing back” from an illness – getting healthy a gain, getting stronger again.

Nico says, “I’ve sworn off women.” “To swear (swear ) off” means to promise not to do something again. “I am swearing off drinking beer.” I’m never going to drink beer again. I’m promising never to drink beer again . That’s “to swear off” something. In this case, Nico is swearing off women . He’s not going to get involved romantically with another woman.

Nico says, “The only female I want in my life right  now is my dog, Fifi.” A “female” (female) is the opposite of a “male” (male). “Male”  and “female” are sexes. The human race has a “male” and a “female.” Many animal s – most animals, I would think – have male and female members. If you don’t know the difference between males and females, I’m not really the person to tel l you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nico: I’ve moving to Atlanta. I want a fresh start.

Celia: This is a surprise. I thought you were going  to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.

Nico: There are too many reminders here. I want a c lean slate. What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminations.

Celia: I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beating your self up over what’s happened, but are you sure moving away will help you move on?

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Gloria and Sam about getting a better job at your company. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Gloria: Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He to ok a job with another company.

Sam: I’m not surprised. He came up against the glas s ceiling and he decided to jump ship.

Gloria: Really? I didn’t know he was bucking for pr omotion.

Sam: He’s been trying to become a manager for three  years, but other people have been promoted over him or they’ve hired from o utside the company.

Gloria: I didn’t know that. I was aware of the wage  disparities within the company and the gender pay gap within each department, but this is news to me.

Sam: Haven’t you noticed that people who take exten ded leave to have children or try for some type of work-life balance are passe d over for plum assignments, raises, and promotions? There are definite limits t o advancement.

Gloria: I thought it was just favoritism on the par t of the bosses. Their friends got promoted and other people didn’t.

Sam: That’s certainly true, but that’s only part of  the story.

Gloria: Why are we still working for a company with  such unfair policies?

Sam: Speak for yourself. I’m giving notice today.

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Limits to Advancement  at Work.” “Advancement” would be getting a higher level or going to a highe r level – in this case, getting a better job at the company where you work. Gloria be gins by saying to Sam, “Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He took a job wit h another company.” Sam says, “I’m not surprised. He came up against the gl ass ceiling and he decided to jump ship.” The term “glass ceiling” (ceiling) refe rs to a limit on how far you can go in your career, in your job, for reasons that ha ve nothing to do with how good you are at your job.

In other words, it’s a limit that is unfair and imp osed by or placed by someone else, perhaps the rules of the company or the cultu re of the company. The term was originally used to refer to the idea that women  and some racial and ethnic minorities were not able to get better jobs because  of some sort of discrimination against them. The “ceiling” of a room is the top of  the room. A room has a floor, a ceiling, and typically four walls.

A “glass ceiling,” if you can imagine such a thing,  would be one that you couldn’t see if you looked up because it’s made of glass – u nless, I guess, the glass was dirty. But anyway, the idea is that you wouldn’t no tice it. It wouldn’t be something you could see, but if you actually went up to the t op of the room, you would hit the glass ceiling and wouldn’t be able to go any hi gher, any farther up. And that’s, you can see, the metaphor here for what mig ht limit you in a company that discriminated against you for some reason related t o your sex or your race or some other reason.

Sam says that Manuel “came up against the glass cei ling,” meaning apparently he had been discriminated against, “and he decided to jump ship.” “To jump ship” (ship) is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to quit y our job or to leave an organization and to go to another job with another company or organization. You could also use this phrasal verb when you leave or quit some job or organization even if you don’t have another job. I guess I’ve he ard it used more often in a case where someone has moved to a different company , say.

Gloria is surprised to hear that Manuel was having these problems. She says, “I didn’t know he was bucking for promotion.” “To buck  (buck) for promotion” or “to buck for a promotion” is to work hard to try to get  a better job within your company. Sam says, “He’s been trying to become a ma nager for three years, but

other people have been promoted over him.” “To be p romoted” (promoted) means to get a better job within a company. The ver b is “to promote.”

Sam thinks that other people have been promoted ove r Manuel, meaning instead of Manuel getting the job, other people have gotten  a job that Manuel wanted or the company has hired from outside their own compan y, finding someone from another company. Gloria says, “I didn’t know that.”  Then she says, “I was aware of the wage disparities within the company.” “Wage”  (wage) refers to how much you make per hour. A “disparity” (disparity) is a d ifference between two things or two people or two groups of people.

“Wage disparities” would refer to differences in ho w people are paid. The idea here, however, is that not only are people paid dif ferently, but once again, they’re being paid differently for some reason that doesn’t  seem fair, that might be discriminatory. Apparently, that’s what’s happening  at this company where Sam and Gloria work. Gloria says she was aware of this,  this case of wage disparities, “and the gender pay gap within each department.” A “gender pay gap” would be differences in how men and women are paid.

The word “gender” (gender) has changed meaning over  the years. We used to use “gender” in talking just about languages such a s French or Italian or Spanish, where the nouns have gender – feminine and masculin e. However, more recently, the word “gender” has come to replace the  word “sex” to refer to men and women. So, instead of talking about “sex discri mination,” people talk about “gender discrimination.”

There’s another political idea behind the change in  the use of the word “gender,” which has to do with whether something called “gend er” is the same as something called “sex” – biological sex – but I won ’t go into that discussion here. For us, the important thing to know is that “gender  pay gap” refers to differences in the way men and women are paid at a company base d on whether they are men or women. That’s the idea. The word “gap” (gap)  is a difference between two things – in this case, between the amount of mo ney you’re getting paid by the company.

Gloria says she was aware of the wage disparities w ithin the company and the gender pay gap within each department or part of the company, “but this is news to me” – that is, it’s news that Manuel was trying to get a job and that he was not successful. Then Sam adds, “Haven’t you noticed tha t people who take extended leave to have children or try some type of work-lif e balance are passed over for plum assignments, raises, and promotions? There are  definite limits to advancement,” Sam says.

 The word “extended” (extended) means long, or longe r than normal. A “leave” (leave) is a period of time when you leave your job  but you are planning on coming back. You may leave for a month or two month s or maybe even longer, but the idea is that you’re not quitting your job –  you’re going to come back and work for the company. You may be paid during your l eave, or it may be an “unpaid leave,” where you don’t get any money from your company but you get your job back when your leave is over.

So, an “extended leave” would be when you stop work ing for your company, usually for several months. People may take an exte nded leave when they have children. A woman may take what is called a “matern ity leave” – that is, when she has her baby, she may decide not to work for th ree months or six months or perhaps longer, and then go back to work. Fathers a re also sometimes given leave in companies. We would call that a “paternity  leave,” I guess. But you may take an extended leave for some other reason.

According to Sam, people who take extended leave to  have children, “or try for some type of work-life balance are passed over for plum assignments.” A “work- life balance” is when you try to usually not work a s hard so that you can enjoy your life more. It relates to the attempt by some p eople to have a good family life as well as a good work life.

He says, “People who take extended leaves for work- life balance are passed over for plum assignments.” “To be passed over” mea ns that you are not given something but the next person is. Manuel apparently  has been taking extended leave and is surprised that he’s being passed over for “plum assignments.” A “plum (plum) assignment” is a very good assignment,  a very good job. Anything that is “plum” is good or attractive. “Plum” is als o a kind of fruit, of course, but here it means a very good job, a very good assignme nt in the company.

These people who take these extended leaves are als o being passed over for raises. A “raise” (raise) is when you get more mone y for doing the same amount of work. “There are definite limits to advancement, ” Sam complains, and I should think there should be, if you’re taking extended le aves and then expecting to get paid the same as people who don’t get extended leav es, but maybe I’m crazy.

Gloria says, “I thought it was just favoritism on t he part of the bosses.” “Favoritism” (favoritism) is when you like one kind  of person or one particular person for reasons that don’t seem fair, that have nothing to do with that person’s qualifications. Gloria thought the reason some peop le were getting raises and

promotions was because the bosses were promoting an d giving raises to their friends.

Sam says, “Well, that’s certainly true, but that’s only part of the story,” meaning that’s not the only reason this has been happening.  Gloria complains, “Why are we still working for a company with such unfair pol icies?” “Unfair” is not fair, not just, not treating everyone equally. A “policy” is the rules or the regulations that a company follows – the way that the company does bus iness. Gloria is wondering why she and Sam are still working for this apparent ly unfair company.

Sam says, “Speak for yourself,” meaning he’s not go ing to continue working for this company. “I’m giving notice today.” “To give n otice” means to tell your company that you are quitting, that you are no long er going to work there. I’m not sure if Gloria and Sam’s company will be all that d isappointed to see them leave. But there you go.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gloria: Did you hear that Manuel is quitting? He to ok a job with another company.

Sam: I’m not surprised. He came up against the glas s ceiling and he decided to jump ship.

Gloria: Really? I didn’t know he was bucking for pr omotion.

Gloria: I thought it was just favoritism on the par t of the bosses. Their friends got promoted and other people didn’t.

Sam: That’s certainly true, but that’s only part of  the story.

 Gloria: Why are we still working for a company with  such unfair policies?

Sam: Speak for yourself. I’m giving notice today.

This episode is a dialogue between Carla and Reuben  about being safe as you are walking down the street. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rueben: I never imagined walking our daughter to sc hool could be so dangerous.

Carla: What happened?

Rueben: We were walking on the sidewalk approaching  the intersection. The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we coul d cross the street. We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy  driving like a demon whips around the corner.

Carla: And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?

Rueben: No, he didn’t even slow down.

Carla: Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the othe r pedestrians?

Rueben: There are several big trees there, so it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.

Carla: Still, he should have stopped. Was anyone hu rt?

Rueben: No, we were able to get out of his way, but  he could have easily taken out five or six people!

Carla: That’s crazy. What we need are flashing cros swalk signs. Maybe that would get drivers’ attention.

Rueben: And maybe armor for our daughter, too?

[end of dialogue]

Reuben begins by saying, “I never imagined walking our daughter to school could be so dangerous.” “I never imagined” means it  had never occurred to me, or I had never thought. Reuben says walking their d aughter to school is “dangerous” (dangerous). “Dangerous” is unsafe – so mething that is risky, something that could hurt you or injure you or poss ibly even kill you. Carla asks, “What happened?”

Reuben says, “We,” meaning he and his daughter, “we re walking on the sidewalk approaching the intersection.” A “sidewalk” (sidewa lk) is a narrow area next to a street usually made of concrete, though it could be  made of asphalt or some other material, where people can walk safely so the y don’t get hit by the cars in the street. The sidewalks are not in the street, th ey’re next to the street. In most American cities, the sidewalks are actually a coupl e of inches higher than the street. Reuben says that he and his daughter a walk ing on the sidewalk approaching the “intersection” (intersection).

An intersection is where two or more streets cross each other, where they meet. “The crossing guard,” says Reuben, “was there to st op traffic so we could cross the street.” Many times, schools will have people c alled “crossing guards” who work at the intersections during the hours in which  children are walking to school or walking home from school in order to stop the ca rs so that the children can cross the street – go from one side of the street t o the other – safely. We call these people “crossing guards” (guard).

“Crossing” comes, of course, from the verb “to cros s,” which here means to go from one side of the street to the other. Here in L os Angeles, you’ll often see crossing guards, and they’re almost always adults w ho are paid to be there for a couple of hours every day, usually, in order to hel p the children cross the street.

When I was growing up, the older children worked as  crossing guards. They would take the children, the younger children, and walk with them, and they would have “flags” – pieces of plastic, I remember them being – on long poles that they would hold out and indicate to the cars t hat they should stop so that the children could walk across the street. This, of cou rse, was usually on corners or intersections where there was no traffic signal, no  electronic signal to stop cars.

 Anyway, the people in my school were called “police  patrols” (patrols). A “police patrol” was a sixth grade student who helped the yo unger students – usually grades one, two, and three – to get home safely fro m school. This was also in a neighborhood where most of the children walked to s chool. This isn’t always the case nowadays, especially in Los Angeles, where the  schools are farther away from children in many cases, and so they have to ta ke a bus. But when they do walk, there are often crossing guards at the corner s near the school so the children can get across the street safely.

Reuben says, “The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we could cross the street.” “Traffic” (traffic) here just refers to the cars that are moving down the street. Reuben continues, “We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy driving like a demon whips around the co rner.” A “crosswalk” (crosswalk) is an area on the street that has two w hite lines and there is room in between the white lines for people to walk. A cross walk is a place where you as a person walking on the street, especially a busy str eet, are supposed to cross.

Cars are supposed to stop if there is someone in the crosswalk. If there’s someone walking across the street in the crosswalk,  the cars are supposed to stop. Now, not all cars do stop, but the law in mos t places says that if you are in the crosswalk, walking across the street, the cars have to stop for you even if the crosswalk is not at an intersection, even if it’s i n the middle of a block, which sometimes happens if there are very long blocks – t hat is, long distances between intersections.

A “designated crosswalk” is just a crosswalk that h as been painted and often has a sign next to it that says “crosswalk” so that dri vers can see that there is a crosswalk there on the street. Reuben says he and h is daughter were “halfway through the designated crosswalk,” meaning they wer e in the middle of the street, “when a guy” – a driver – “driving like a d emon whipped around the corner.”

The word “demon” (demon) here refers technically to  some sort of evil person or evil spirit. Here it probably just means something like a crazy person or a person who wasn’t driving very carefully. “To whip” (whip)  here means to move very rapidly, so “to whip around the corner” means to tu rn the corner – to go from one street to the intersecting street, or the street th at crosses the street that you are on.

Carla says, “And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?” Some intersections have stop signs, which is usually a red sign that has white l etters that say – surprise,

surprise – “Stop.” Other intersections have traffic  lights. These are lights – red, yellow, and green – that indicate whether you shoul d stop or go. Of course, in most big cities, most intersections don’t have stop  signs or traffic lights. You’re just supposed to slow down at the intersections and  the first person to the intersection gets to go first.

Well, anyway, in this story, Carla is surprised tha t this driver didn’t stop at the stop sign, which of course the driver should have. That’s the law in most American cities. Reuben says, “No, he didn’t even s low down.” He didn’t even decrease his speed. Carla said, “Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the other pedestrians?” A “pedestrian” (pedestrian) is anothe r name for a person who is walking – someone who is not in a car or on a motor cycle but who is outside walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.

Reuben says, “There are several big trees there, so  it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.” A “corner” (corner) is another word for an intersection where two streets cross, two or more streets cross. A “blind (blind) corner” is a corner where, as you’re driving down one street, you canno t see the cars coming on the other street – perhaps there’s a building there, or  in this case, there are several big trees there. Because of the big trees, there is  “limited visibility” (visibility). “Visibility” means the ability to see.

So, if there is “limited visibility,” there is not an easy way for you to see, or it is difficult for you to see. Carla says, “Still, he sh ould have stopped. Was anyone hurt?” Reuben says, “No, we were able to get out of  his way.” “To get out of someone’s way” means to move in order to avoid bein g hit by another person – perhaps that person is walking or perhaps that pers on is driving a car, as was the case here in this dialogue.

Reuben says, “He could have easily taken out five o r six people!” The phrasal verb “to take out” can mean a lot of different thin gs. Here, it means to kill someone. If the car had “taken out” five or six peo ple, the car would have hit and killed five or six people. “To take out” can also m ean to go to a restaurant and pick up your food – we call that “takeout food” as a noun, and the verb would be “to take out.”

“To take out” can also mean simply to remove. We us ually use that phrasal verb in that sense, when we’re talking about the garbage  or trash in your house. “I have to take out the trash” (trash). That means I h ave to take the junk inside my house that I no longer want and bring it outside, u sually to put it in another container  – what we would call a “bin” (bin), a “t rash bin” – and then later take

the trash bin out to the street so that someone can  come and take the trash away. But here, “to take out” means to kill.

Carla says, “That’s crazy. What we need are flashin g crosswalk signs.” “Flashing” (flashing) is when a light turns on and off repeatedly – on and off, on and off, on and off. That would be “flashing.” “To flash” has some other interesting meanings, but we won’t talk about those  today. You can look at the Learning Guide for those. Carla says that they need  “flashing crosswalk signs” – that is, signs on the side of the road that not onl y indicate that there is a crosswalk on the street, but have lights flashing s o that you notice the signs. “Maybe that would get drivers’ attention,” she says .

Then Reuben jokes at the end, “And maybe armor for our daughter, too?” “Armor” (armor) is a word you don’t see a lot anymo re. It’s basically a heavy metal covering that is worn for protection. We asso ciate it with medieval days, of knights fighting in a battle, and they would have s pecial clothing that would protect them from swords and other arms that the ot her soldiers would try to injure them with.

That’s why we know Reuben is making a joke here. He ’s not actually suggesting that his daughter go out with metal clothing on so that she doesn’t get hurt, though here in Los Angeles, it might not be a bad i dea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rueben: I never imagined walking our daughter to sc hool could be so dangerous.

Carla: What happened?

Rueben: We were walking on the sidewalk approaching  the intersection. The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we coul d cross the street. We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy  driving like a demon whips around the corner.

Carla: And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?

Rueben: No, he didn’t even slow down.

Carla: Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the othe r pedestrians?

 Rueben: There are several big trees there, so it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.

Carla: Still, he should have stopped. Was anyone hu rt?

Rueben: No, we were able to get out of his way, but  he could have easily taken out five or six people!

Carla: That’s crazy. What we need are flashing cros swalk signs. Maybe that would get drivers’ attention.

Rueben: And maybe armor for our daughter, too?

# Using Profanity

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,178 – Using Profanity.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,178. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store while you’re there. We have some additional courses in Bu siness and Daily English I think you might be interested in. You can also like  us on Facebook. Go to facebook.com/eslpod. This episode is a dialogue bet ween Cameron and Dorothy about using bad language. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cameron: Oh, f***!

Dorothy: Watch your language. I don’t want the kids  to hear foul language.

Cameron: Sorry, I stubbed my toe. What’s the big de al? Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.

Dorothy: Not my kids, at least not yet. I don’t wan t them learning to swear before they learn to walk. I don’t want them to grow up to  be rude and offensive people.

Cameron: You can’t protect them from every damn thi ng people say.

Dorothy: Okay, that’s it. If you’re going to live h ere, we’ll need a swear jar.

Cameron: A what?!

Dorothy: A swear jar. For every swear word you say,  you’ll need to put a dollar into the jar. We’ll save the money for the kids’ ed ucation.

Cameron: What the f***?!

Dorothy: Hey, there will be no profanity of any kin d in this house. I don’t want you to be a bad influence on my children. Go ahead. Put  a dollar into that jar.

Cameron: I’m not putting a dollar into that jar.

 Dorothy: My house, my rules.

Cameron: Unbelievable!

[end of dialogue]

Cameron begins by saying, “Oh, f***!” Well, we don’ t actually hear the word that Cameron is about to use or was going to use, but it  begins with the letter F. And you probably already know, without me having to exp lain it to you, that a very bad word in English begins with the letter F and en ds with the letter K and is four letters long.

Dorothy says to Cameron, “Watch your language.” The  expression “to watch your language” means to be careful with your words – in particular, to be careful that you don’t say any bad words, any “profanity” (profa nity). “Profanity” would be a very bad word, what we might call “foul language” –  words that you do not want your children to hear, words that are considered “v ulgar” (vulgar). A vulgar word is a word that is a bad word, that is inappropriate  for most situations. Dorothy says, “Watch your language. I don’t want the kids” – the children – “to hear foul language” (once again, “foul language” meaning bad words).

Cameron says, “Sorry, I stubbed my toe.” Your “toe”  is on your foot. Your hand has fingers. Your feet have toes. “To stub (stub) y our toe” is to hit your toe accidentally against something hard. We have all do ne this. You’re walking around your house without any shoes on and you acci dentally hit your foot against the chair and stub your toe. Your toe hits the chair and it hurts a lot, and sometimes when we get hurt, we like to use foul lan guage to express our pain or to express the emotion we’re going through when we feel that pain. That’s what Cameron did. He stubbed his toe.

Cameron doesn’t understand why Dorothy is upset wit h him. He says, “What’s the big deal?” A “big deal” is something that is im portant, something that is very significant. So when he asks, “What’s the big deal, ” he’s saying, “Why do you think this is so important?” When someone says, “Wh at’s the big deal?” he’s really saying, “I don’t think this is important. Wh y do you?” Cameron says, “Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.” “To  curse” (curse) means to use bad words, to use foul language.

Dorothy says, “Not my kids, at least not yet.” She means she doesn’t apparently allow her kids to watch TV shows and movies that ha ve cursing in them, that have foul language in them. And that’s very difficu lt to do nowadays. Even

television in the United States has a lot of foul l anguage that you would not want your children to hear. Dorothy continues, “I don’t want them,” meaning her children, “learning to swear before they learn to w alk.” “To swear” (swear) means the same as “to curse.” It means to use foul langua ge, to use vulgarities, to use bad words, to use profanity.

I should point out that technically, or at least, o ne meaning of “to curse” would be to use the name of God or some higher authority whe n you are swearing – in particular, to perhaps ask God to do something bad to another person or even the situation in which you are in. The word “God” o ften gets connected with the word “damn” (damn) followed by the word “it” or a p erson. Someone who is frustrated, for example, might say, “God damn it.” I don’t like the term and I would not suggest you use that term. It is considered fou l language in polite conversation.

Dorothy says she doesn’t want her children “to lear n to swear before they learn to walk,” meaning her children are probably very yo ung since children learn to walk at a young age. “I don’t want them to grow up to be rude and offensive people.” “Rude” (rude) means not polite. Someone wh o is rude to you says something bad to you or isn’t very polite to you. “ Offensive” (offensive) is when you hurt another person’s feelings or when you insu lt someone. Cameron says, “You can’t protect them from every damn thing peopl e say.”

Remember, I said the word “damn” is sometimes used with the word “God,” but “damn” itself is also considered a foul word or a s wear word. Certainly my mother would never allow me to use that word in our house when I was growing up. It’s used as an adjective when you are frustrated or whe n you are angry at something. Again, it’s considered rude. It’s consid ered foul language and not the sort of thing you would use in public, and certainl y not the sort of thing you would want to use around children, although I’m sure some  parents do when they’re angry.

Dorothy doesn’t like it. She says, “Okay, that’s it . If you’re going to live here, we’ll need a swear jar.” A “swear jar” (jar) is a contain er that some people use in some families as a way of trying to punish people, child ren in a family, from using foul language. Every time you use a bad word, you have t o put money into the swear jar as a punishment. “Jars” are containers that are  usually made out of glass. When you buy certain kinds of food like, I don’t kn ow, jam or pickles or olives, they’re typically are sold in the stores in jars, i n glass containers.

Well, Dorothy is going to have Cameron put money in to a swear jar every time he uses a bad word. She explains this. She says, “For every swear word you say,

you’ll need to put a dollar into the jar. We’ll sav e the money for the kids’ education.” I’m not exactly sure what the relations hip is between Dorothy and Cameron; perhaps Cameron is some sort of relative w ho is staying with Dorothy, a brother or a cousin perhaps. Dorothy says the money in the swear jar will be used for their children’s education. Cameron is sho cked, surprised by this. So he almost swears again. He says, “What the f***?!”

Dorothy says, “Hey, there will be no profanity of a ny kind in this house. I don’t want you to be a bad influence on my children.” A “ bad influence” would be something or someone that causes another person to be worse. Parents often worry about their children’s friends because they d on’t want their children to have bad influences in their life – other children who m ay make their children worse perhaps than they already are. Movies, books, telev ision programs could also be considered bad influences, depending on their conte nts, of course.

Dorothy says, “Go ahead. Put a dollar into that jar .” Cameron says, “I’m not putting a dollar into that jar.” Dorothy then says something that many parents will say to their teenage children or adult children who  are living with them: “My house, my rules,” meaning I own this house, therefo re you must follow my rules, my regulations.

Cameron says, “Unbelievable!” The word here, “unbel ievable,” is used to express frustration about how surprised you are by somethin g because you think it is so unreasonable, because you think it is wrong. Nevert heless, it is Dorothy’s house, and so Cameron – if he wants to live there, whoever  he is – will have to follow her rules.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cameron: Oh, f***!

Dorothy: Watch your language. I don’t want the kids  to hear foul language.

Cameron: Sorry, I stubbed my toe. What’s the big de al? Kids hear all kinds of cursing on TV and in movies.

Dorothy: Not my kids, at least not yet. I don’t wan t them learning to swear before they learn to walk. I don’t want them to grow up to  be rude and offensive people.

Cameron: You can’t protect them from every damn thi ng people say.

This episode is a dialogue between Amy and Giorgio about understanding what is in the food you buy from a store. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Amy: Put a big bag of those potato chips in the bas ket.

Giorgio: Have you read the nutritional label on the se chips?

Amy: No, but look. This doesn’t have very much satu rated fat, trans fat, or sodium.

Giorgio: Look at the serving size. It’s three potat o chips. How often do you stop at three chips?

Amy: Okay, no potato chips. I’ll get this package of cookies. There aren’t many calories or carbohydrates in these, or much cholest erol or sugar either.

Giorgio: Look again. The serving size is one cookie . There are 40 cookies in each container.

Amy: Not everything has to be healthy and good for me.

Giorgio: No, but you have to get your protein and f iber from somewhere. If you look at the percent daily value on the things you’r e eating, you’re not getting the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your body needs.

Amy: This isn’t all I eat. I eat other things, too.

Giorgio: Like pizza, hamburgers, and fries?

Amy: I might not have the best diet, but I’m health y as a horse.

Giorgio: Maybe a horse ready to be put out to pastu re!

[end of dialogue]

Amy begins our dialogue by saying to Giorgio, “Put a big bag of those potato chips in the basket.” “Potato chips” are made, of c ourse, from potatoes. They usually have salt on them. They’re very thin and are typically fried. A “basket” here refers to a shopping basket. It’s a container that you put things into when you are shopping at a grocery store, at a store whe re you buy food. Giorgio says, “Have you read the nutritional label on these chips ?”

“Nutrition” (nutrition) refers to the kind of food you eat, and in particular, the quality of the food or the ingredients of the food – what’s in the food. “Nutritional labels” (labels) are found on most foods that you b uy in a grocery store or another store in the U.S. The government requires t hat the makers of the food put a label – that is, a small piece of paper or so mething that is on the outside of the food package (what the food comes in) – that in dicates what is in the food, in particular certain categories of ingredients or cer tain categories of nutrition. We’ll talk about those categories in a minute.

Amy says, “No” – she has not looked at or read the nutritional label. “But look,” she says, “This doesn’t have very much saturated fa t, trans fat, or sodium.” Amy is now looking at the label and telling Giorgio tha t these potato chips that she wants to buy don’t have very much “saturated (satur ated) fat.” Saturated fat, without going into a technical, scientific explanat ion, is usually fat that comes from animal products.

The word “saturated” refers to its chemical composi tion, how it is actually formed chemically. There are “saturated fats,” “mono satur ated fats,” “poly saturated fats,” and “trans fats.” If you want a definition f or all of those things, it’s best to look online. But a saturated fat is a fat that is s olid or would be solid at room temperature. There are some people who think satura ted fats are bad for you, other people who say it doesn’t really matter.

We’re not going to go into those arguments here, bu t many Americans have been told for many years that saturated fats are bad for them. That’s why Amy

says look, it doesn’t have any, or “very much,” sat urated fat. She says it doesn’t have very much “trans (trans) fat.” A trans fat is made usually from some sort of chemical process, and again, there are many people who think trans fat is very bad for your health. The third item Amy mentions is  “sodium” (sodium). Sodium is basically salt.

Giorgio says, however, “Look at the serving size.” The “serving (serving) size” is the amount of food that the people who make the foo d say would be typical for one person to eat. If you make the serving size ver y small, then it will look as though that the amount of, say, sodium or trans fat  is not very high. But oftentimes, the serving size on a package of food i s not very realistic, but the company makes it really small so that when you look  at the nutritional label, it doesn’t look as though there is a lot of, say, tran s fat or sodium in it.

Giorgio says the serving size for these potato chip s is three potato chips. “How often do you stop at three chips?” meaning “How oft en do you only eat three chips and not continue to eat more?” There was a fa mous advertisement for a potato chip company, and the ad said, “No one could  eat just one,” meaning if you ate one potato chip, you would want to eat more  – which of course is true for a lot of food such as potato chips. Amy says, “Okay , no potato chips,” meaning she won’t buy any potato chips.

She says, “I’ll get this package of cookies. There aren’t many calories or carbohydrates in these, or much cholesterol or suga r either.” Amy mentions a couple of other categories that are typically found  on a nutritional label. The one that you will almost always find is “calories” (cal ories). A “calorie” is technically a unit of heat energy, but most people think of a cal orie as how much energy you could get out of this particular kind of food. Most  men eat around 2,000 to 3,000 in the United States per day. The average American woman eats around 1,800 calories per day.

“Carbohydrates” are one of the three major kinds of  “nutrients,” we call them. There are “carbohydrates,” “fat,” and “protein.” Ca rbohydrates are basically foods that are or nutrients that are turned into sugar an d used for energy. A lot of the foods we eat have a combination of carbohydrates, p rotein, and fat in them. Amy also mentions “cholesterol” (cholesterol). Choleste rol is something that your body needs in order to function. Cholesterol can in cert ain cases be bad for you, at least too much of a certain kind of cholesterol in your body.

Once again, there is a relationship between the cho lesterol you eat and the cholesterol in your body, but it’s not the same thi ng. People sometimes confuse the two. Your body needs cholesterol. Cholesterol i s a good thing. But there are

debates about how much eating cholesterol may affec t your body’s or blood’s cholesterol levels. “Sugar” (sugar), you’re probabl y familiar with, is the kind of thing that makes food sweet.

Giorgio says, “Look again. The serving size is one cookie. There are 40 cookies in each container” – that is, in each package. Once  again Giorgio is pointing out that even though the nutritional label indicates th ere aren’t very many calories in this package of cookies, the serving size is only o ne. “Not everything has to be healthy and good for me,” Amy responds. Giorgio say s, “No, but you have to get your protein and fiber from somewhere.” “Protein” ( protein), we’ve already pointed out, is one of the three major types of nut rients – things that your body needs.

Your body needs protein for all sorts of things, in cluding building muscles. “Fiber” (fiber) is actually a kind of carbohydrate. It’s the part of typically a plant that is eaten but is difficult for your body to digest. We won’t go into all the technical definitions of the different kinds of fiber – “solu ble fiber,” “insoluble fiber,” and so forth – but fiber basically doesn’t get absorbed in to your body. You eat it and then it ends up eventually going out of your body in a w ay that I think you probably can guess.

“If you look at the percent daily value on the thin gs you’re eating,” Giorgio continues, “you’re not getting the nutrients, vitam ins, and minerals your body needs.” The U.S. government has decided, or has rec ommended, that everyone get a certain amount of these different kinds of nu trients and other food elements every day. And so when you look on a nutritional la bel in the United States, you will see something called the “percent daily value. ” That indicates how much of the recommended daily amount of that particular thi ng this food provides.

So, if a food says it provides 10 percent of the fi ber that you need, you would know then that you still have 90 percent to go with  the other food in order to get what the U.S. government thinks is the amount of fi ber you need every day. These “percent daily values” are not all that usefu l for many people since some people need more of things than other people. Our b odies are different. But the government wants to give you some idea of what you need every day from your food.

Giorgio says, “You’re not getting the nutrients (nu trients) your body needs.” “Nutrients” refers to carbohydrates, protein, and f at, as well as vitamins and minerals. “Vitamins” (vitamins) refers to a substan ce that is required for growth or survival but that is usually only needed in a small  amount. Once again, that’s not a very technical definition of a vitamin.

 “Minerals” (minerals) are what we call “inorganic s ubstances” – non-living things that are required, but once again are only needed i n very small amounts. Vitamins in English are typically given letters. Th ere’s vitamin A. There’s vitamin B. There might even be different types of different  vitamin letters – vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and so forth. Minerals are things like calcium, sodium, potassium , magnesium, that the body also uses.

Amy says, “This isn’t all I eat. I eat other things , too.” Giorgio says, “Like pizza, hamburgers, and fries?” Here, the word “fries” refe rs to French fries – potatoes that are cut up and put into oil. Amy says, “I migh t not have the best diet, but I’m healthy as a horse.” This expression, “healthy as a  horse,” is an old one meaning very healthy. Although I have to be honest, I’ve ne ver used it myself.

Giorgio says, “Maybe a horse ready to be put out to  pasture!” Giorgio then makes a joke about this expression. When a horse is old a nd can no longer be used for riding or racing, we may put that horse “out to pas ture” (pasture). “Pasture” is land that cattle or horses eat off of. It’s an area  on a farm where you can put the animals because they can eat what is growing out of  the ground.

“To put a horse out to pasture” means to retire the  horse, to no longer use the horse, to let the horse live the rest of its days –  live the rest of its life – just eating food and not doing anything. It’s another expressio n for “retiring” someone. Giorgio is making a joke here, saying that Amy isn’ t healthy as a horse unless she means an old horse, a sick horse – a horse that  is no longer healthy anymore, really.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Amy: Put a big bag of those potato chips in the bas ket.

Giorgio: Have you read the nutritional label on the se chips?

Amy: No, but look. This doesn’t have very much satu rated fat, trans fat, or sodium.

Giorgio: Look at the serving size. It’s three potat o chips. How often do you stop at three chips?

 Amy: Okay, no potato chips. I’ll get this package of cookies. There aren’t many calories or carbohydrates in these, or much cholest erol or sugar either.

Giorgio: Look again. The serving size is one cookie . There are 40 cookies in each container.

Amy: Not everything has to be healthy and good for me.

Giorgio: No, but you have to get your protein and f iber from somewhere. If you look at the percent daily value on the things you’r e eating, you’re not getting the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your body needs.

Amy: This isn’t all I eat. I eat other things, too.

Giorgio: Like pizza, hamburgers, and fries?

Amy: I might not have the best diet, but I’m health y as a horse.

Giorgio: Maybe a horse ready to be put out to pastu re!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,180 – Price Gouging.

This episode is a dialogue between Pedro and Elisa about companies that increase their prices suddenly. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pedro: Why are you changing the prices on all of th ose items in the store?

Elisa: Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane comin g. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.

Pedro: I know that, but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.

Elisa: There’s nothing wrong with taking advantage of a spike in demand during emergency situations. We’re in business to make mon ey.

Pedro: That’s price gouging and you know it. There are laws against that. And plus, we shouldn’t be exploiting people’s fear.

Elisa: I’m not responsible for that hurricane and I  didn’t tell people to hoard. I’m not hiking prices so high that people can’t afford it. I’m just increasing them to discourage hoarding, that’s all.

Pedro: I don’t know. It still doesn’t feel right. I t feels like we’re profiteering.

Elisa: No, we’re not. We’re making a sound business  decision. Hey, where are you going with those?

Pedro: I’m putting some of these items in the back to reserve for people who can’t afford your new prices, the poorest and the m ost vulnerable in our community.

Elisa: You’re not suggesting we give those items aw ay!

Pedro: You’ll thank me later for helping you to ass uage your guilty conscience.

Elisa: Humph!

[end of dialogue]

Pedro begins by asking Elisa, “Why are you changing  the prices on all of those items in the store?” An “item” is simply a thing th at you sell in your store. Alisa says, “Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane comin g. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.”

A “hurricane” (hurricane) is a violent storm with w inds that move in a circle, in a circular motion. These are called “typhoons” in som e parts of the world. Basically, in the Atlantic Ocean, these storms are called “hur ricanes.” They’re the storms that typically affect the eastern and southern part  of the U.S. In certain parts of the Pacific Ocean and other oceans, they’re called “typhoons,” but it’s the same weather phenomenon.

“People will be stocking up,” Elisa says. “To stock  (stock) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to buy a lot of something and save it to use later. If there is a hurricane coming, it’s possible that the stores w ill then be closed, and so you will want to stock up – you will want to get a lot of things that you will need so that you can survive. We would call these things “basic (basic) necessities.” “Necessities” comes from the word “necessary.” It’s  referring to things that you actually need to live, such as food and water.

So, Elisa is raising the prices – changing the pric es on the items in her store because everyone is going to be coming and buying b asic necessities, and one of the features of what we call a “market economy” is that the price of something depends on both how much there is of it and how muc h people want it. And if there isn’t very much and a lot of people want it, the price goes up.

Elisa is expecting more people to want to buy thing s from her store, and so she’s raising the prices. Pedro says, “I know that,” mean ing I know there’s a hurricane coming, “but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.” The

phrasal verb “to jack (jack) up” means to increase very significantly in a very short amount of time. Pedro had never studied econo mics in school, it appears.

Elisa says, “There’s nothing wrong with taking adva ntage of a spike in demand during emergency situations. We’re in business to make money.” A “spike” (spike) here refers to a sudden increase in somethi ng or in the amount of something. The “spike” Elisa’s referring to is a “s pike in demand” (demand). As I just mentioned, there are two things that determine  price, basically. “Demand” is the amount that people want something. “Supply” (su pply) is how much of something there is.

People adjust their priorities – people decide what ’s important to them – in part by what they buy. If something is very important to  you, then you may not buy certain things in order to have money to buy other things – things that might have a higher price. That’s one of the things that price  does. It communicates information to you about how much something is avai lable and how much other people want it, and allows you to make decisions ba sed on that information.

Elisa says that she is “taking advantage of,” meani ng she’s trying to get a benefit from, the increase in demand or spike in demand dur ing this emergency situation – the hurricane. “We’re in business to make money,”  she says. That’s the reason that she has her business. Pedro says, “That’s pric e gouging and you know it.” “Price gouging” (gouging) is not so much an economi c concept as it is a moral determination or an ethical judgment on people who do in fact raise their prices suddenly when someone needs something and wants it very badly during an emergency situation.

“To gouge” someone is to be unfair in the price tha t you charge that person. “Price gouging” is the idea that if you raise your prices significantly for something that someone wants and needs very badly – if you ra ise it significantly and quickly, I think is the idea here – then you may be  accused by some people of “price gouging” – of being unfair to people because  you have raised your prices significantly.

Pedro says, “There are laws against that.” I’m not sure if that’s true in most places in the U.S. Perhaps it is. No doubt in some places that might be true, or in other countries that might be true. “And plus” – me aning in addition – Pedro says, “we shouldn’t be exploiting people’s fear.” “To exp loit” (exploit) means to take advantage of someone or something in an unfair way,  to hurt another person in some way that involves the advantage that you have over that person.

Pedro thinks that raising the prices would be “expl oiting people’s fear.” I’m not sure why it exploits people’s fear, but that’s what  Pedro thinks. Elisa says, “I’m not responsible for that hurricane and I didn’t tel l people to hoard” (hoard). “To hoard” – very important you pronounce the last cons onant there, the D – means to buy a very large number of things, more than wha t you actually need or more than what you could even use.

Sometimes people use this verb when they have some sort of psychological problem – when they collect all sorts of things in their house and their house doesn’t have any more room anymore because they’re hoarding certain things. But in this situation, “to hoard” means to buy more  than what you are really going to use, just because you perhaps are afraid that yo u will no longer have enough. You will “run out,” to use the phrasal verb. So, El isa says she’s not telling people to hoard.

She says, “I’m not hiking prices so high that peopl e can’t afford it.” “To hike” (hike) a price means to increase it dramatically. S he says she’s increasing her prices, but not so high that people can’t afford it , meaning that no one could actually buy it. That would be stupid for her to do  economically, of course, because if she raises the price so high that no one  can buy it then she won’t make any money. “I’m just increasing them,” meaning  her prices, “to discourage hoarding, that’s all.” “To discourage” (discourage)  means to make other people not want to do something.

Elisa is saying that she’s increasing her prices so  people don’t hoard and presumably there will be more of these basic necess ities for other people. I’m not sure if that’s exactly her reason and neither is Pe dro. He says, “I don’t know. It still doesn’t feel right,” meaning it doesn’t seem correct. It doesn’t seem like it is ethical. “It feels like we’re profiteering.” “Profi teering” (profiteering) means to make an unfair profit.

Usually the idea here is that you’re making a large  amount of money, but you’re hurting other people while doing it. We only think this typically of other people or other companies that raise their prices suddenly. I f we’re benefiting from it, well, we don’t normally consider ourselves to be profitee ring. Elisa says, “No, we’re not,” meaning we’re not profiteering. “We’re making  a sound business decision.” The word “sound” here refers not to noise or someth ing that you can hear, but rational, logical, well thought out. “It’s a sound decision.” It’s a good, reasonable decision.

“Hey, we’re you going with those?” Elisa says. Pedr o responds, “I’m putting some of these items in the back,” meaning in the back of  the store, “to reserve for

people who can’t afford your new prices.” “To reser ve” (reserve) here means to save something that you are going to use at a later  time. Pedro says, “the poorest and most vulnerable in our community” are g oing to be the ones he’s going to give or sell these items to – “vulnerable”  (vulnerable) means easily hurt or damaged – people who, according to Pedro, won’t have enough money to buy these basic necessities.

Elisa says, “You’re not suggesting we give those it ems away!” “To give something away” means to let other people have it f or free, to not charge them any money. Pedro says, “You’ll thank me later for h elping you to assuage your guilty conscience.” “To assuage” (assuage) means to  reduce, to make less intense. Something may “assuage” your fears, may ma ke you less afraid. In this case, Pedro wants to assuage Elisa’s “guilty consci ence” (conscience). Your “conscience” is what tells you whether something is  right or wrong. If you are guilty, you’ve done something wrong.

So, a “guilty conscience” is the idea you have that  you’ve done something wrong. And that’s what Pedro thinks Elisa is doing by rais ing the prices on basic necessities. So, he’s going to give some of the thi ngs the store sells to people who he considers poor and vulnerable so that Elisa won’t feel so bad in the future when she will no doubt regret having raised the pri ces. That’s why he says, “You’ll thank me later” – when you realize what you  are doing – “for helping you assuage your guilty conscience.” Elisa, of course, isn’t very happy with Pedro for doing this.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pedro: Why are you changing the prices on all of th ose items in the store?

Elisa: Haven’t you heard? There’s a hurricane comin g. People will be stocking up on basic necessities.

Pedro: I know that, but that still doesn’t explain why you’ve decided to jack up prices.

This episode is a dialogue between Eileen and Dex a bout someone who was popular a long time ago who wants to be popular aga in. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Eileen: What are you doing with all that band equip ment?

Dex: The guys in the band are planning a reunion. I t’s time for our comeback. It will be the stuff of legends!

Eileen: Aren’t you afraid of being called has-beens  after all these years?

Dex: Bite your tongue. There is a groundswell of su pport for this reunion and we’re not going to disappoint the fans.

Eileen: Groundswell? Are you referring to that loca l news article about one-hit wonders asking, “Where are they now?”

Dex: There was a lot of good response to my quote a bout our possible reunion. After a 20-year hiatus, I think fans are ready for more music from us. It should lead to a tour.

Eileen: Resurrecting your music career might be har der than you guys think.

Dex: Stop being such a killjoy. This reunion could lead to an entire new generation of fans.

Eileen: Or you could become the laughingstock of the music world.

 Dex: Okay, that’s enough. You’re officially out of the band.

Eileen: I didn’t know I was in the band.

Dex: I had considered making you a backup singer, b ut I can’t deal with your negativity.

Eileen: Oh, poor me. I’ll never find stardom.

Dex: You’ve had your chance!

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Making a Comeback” (c omeback). A “comeback” is usually when a famous person, someone in sports or entertainment, becomes popular after many years of no longer being popular . So, they’re popular, and then they’re not popular, and then they become popu lar again. Some old actors and singers try to make a comeback. They try to bec ome popular again after 10, 15, or 20 years of not being popular. You see this a lot in music, and that’s the topic of today’s dialogue.

Eileen says to Dex, “What are you doing with all th at band equipment?” “Band” (band) is a group of musicians who perform together . Guitars, drums, speakers – those are things that might be part of the “band eq uipment” that Eileen is talking about. Dex says, “The guys,” meaning probably the m en in the band, “are planning a reunion.” A “reunion” (reunion) is an ev ent that is for people who used to be related in some way to get back together agai n and have a party or have some sort of celebration.

The members of Dex’s band are planning a reunion. H e says, “It’s time for our comeback. It will be the stuff of legends!” The exp ressions “stuff (stuff) of legends (legends)” means that it is going to be very famous , something that is well known, something that will be popular, that many pe ople will be talking about. Eileen says, “Aren’t you afraid of being called has -beens after all these years?”

The term “has (has) – been (been)” refers to someon e who used to be popular and successful but is no longer popular, but this p erson continues to talk about it. You can find lots of has-been actors here in Los An geles. The term “has-been” is definitely an insulting one. It is used to refer to  someone who isn’t famous anymore but was once famous. It could also refer to  someone who was once good at something but is no longer good at that thi ng.

 Dex responds to Eileen, “Bite your tongue.” This ex pression “to bite (bite) your tongue (tongue)” means be silent, be quiet, don’t s ay what you want to say right now. “There is a groundswell of support for this re union,” Dex says, “and we’re not going to disappoint the fans.” A “groundswell” (groundswell) is an increase in something, especially in public opinion – when peop le start liking something. Usually this happens very quickly.

A “fan” (fan) is someone who likes a particular per son or thing. It could be a celebrity. It could be a movie. It could be a sport s team. It could be even a particular kind of food. “I’m a fan of shrimp.” Tha t means I really like shrimp. Or “I’m a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.” I really li ke that baseball team. Eileen, however, doubts that Dex is correct about this grou ndswell. She says, “Groundswell? Are you referring to that local news article about one-hit wonders asking, ‘Where Are They Now?’”

A “one-hit wonder” (wonder) is a person or a group that had one popular song and then nothing else. The person or group only had  one popular song that everybody knows and everybody can sing, but that wa s it. That was the only hit, the only success they had. That’s a “one-hit wonder .” Eileen says there was an article in the newspaper – or perhaps the Internet website – about one-hit wonders, asking what these people or what these gro ups are doing now. Dex says, “There was a lot of good response to my quote  about our possible reunion.”

So apparently Dex was interviewed for this article,  and there is something that he said in the article. That’s what he means by “my qu ote” (quote). “After a 20-year hiatus, I think fans are ready for more music from us.” A “hiatus” (hiatus) is a break, a pause, often a very long pause, in some ac tivity – in this case, a 20-year break. “It should lead to a tour,” Dex says. He’s r eferring to this reunion concert that they are planning on giving. A “tour” (tour) i s when a musician or a band travels from city to city giving performances.

Eileen says, “Resurrecting your music career might be harder than you guys think.” “To resurrect” (resurrect) refers to bringi ng something or someone back to life. More generally, it means to try to make somet hing popular that was once popular in the past but is no longer so. Dex says, “Stop being such a killjoy.” A “killjoy” (killjoy) is a person who makes it diffic ult for other people to enjoy something, who makes it difficult for other people to have fun, perhaps by making negative comments.

Eileen doubts that Dex and his band will be able to  make a comeback, but Dex says, “Stop being such a killjoy. This reunion coul d lead to an entire new

generation of fans,” meaning a whole new group of y ounger people who will like their music. Eileen says, “Or you could become the laughingstock of the music world.” A “laughingstock” (laughingstock) – one wor d – is a person that other people make fun of, that other people laugh at, usu ally because that person is doing something embarrassing or stupid that other p eople laugh at.

Eileen thinks that Dex and his band will be “the la ughingstock of the music world,” meaning everyone else who is involved in ma king and selling music. Dex says, “Okay, that’s enough. You’re officially out of the band,” meaning you will not be a member of the band. Eileen says, “I didn’t  know I was in the band.” Dex responds, “I had considered making you a backup sin ger, but I can’t deal with your negativity.”

A “backup singer” is someone who provides help for the lead or main singer in a band. You still see this in some musical groups. Th ere will usually be two people, maybe more, who are standing in the back who are al so singing the song, helping the main singer of the song – the person we  would call the “lead (lead) singer” of the band.

Dex says he had considered making Eileen a backup s inger, but he can’t deal with her “negativity” (negativity). “Negativity” is  the same as being pessimistic – having negative thoughts and feelings about somethi ng or talking in a negative way: always criticizing, always complaining, or alw ays seeing the bad side of things. Eileen somewhat jokingly says, “Oh, poor me . I’ll never find stardom.” “Stardom” (stardom) refers to having your name and your work known by lots of different people – being a star, being famous.

Dex, however, says to her, “You’ve had your chance. ” “You’ve had your chance” is a phrase we use to tell someone that he or she h as lost a good opportunity by not taking advantage of it during a certain period of time. Eileen doesn’t really feel sorry. She doesn’t really think she was going to be a star. But Dex is mad at her and says, “Well you’ve had your chance,” meanin g you could have been famous, but because of your negativity, you won’t.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Eileen: What are you doing with all that band equip ment?

Dex: The guys in the band are planning a reunion. I t’s time for our comeback. It will be the stuff of legends!

# Finding a Parking Space

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,182 – Finding a Parking Space.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,182. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com to become a member of ESL Podcast.  You can also find us on Facebook. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue abo ut trying to find a place to park your car. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alan: We have to find a parking space. Let’s drive around the block one more time. Did you say that the restaurant we’re going t o has no off-street parking at all?

Sasha: None. When I called the restaurant earlier t oday, I was told they have ample street parking.

Alan: Obviously not on a Saturday night. Look, ther e’s a space!

Sasha: No, look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone.

Alan: This is impossible. We’ve driven along this s treet four times and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters. I’d b e willing to plug the meter all evening if we could just find a space.

Sasha: I have an idea. Pull into that red zone.

Alan: Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that?

Sasha: This is my grandfather’s handicapped placard . I borrowed it. We can park here with this.

Alan: I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parkin g ticket or worse, and we really shouldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anywa y.

 Sasha: Do you know how many strings I had to pull t o get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town? Come on, let’s go. Why are you checking your wallet? Dinner is my treat.

Alan: I just want to make sure I have enough cash f or a taxi when your car gets towed!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Alan saying to Sasha, “We have to find a parking space. ” A “parking space” is a small area, a place  in which you can park your car. If you drive down the street, usually there are spaces along the street where you can park a car. Alan is looking for a parking s pace. He suggests to Sasha that they “drive around the block one more time.”

A “block” (block) here refers to a square or rectan gle of land that is surrounded by four streets. So, in a typical city, some of the  streets go north to south, others go east to west, and you can find “blocks” that are  in between the streets. The blocks are where the houses and buildings are. You drive your car on the street, of course. They’re going to drive around the block in order to find a parking space.

Alan says, “Did you say that the restaurant we’re g oing to has no off-street parking at all?” “Off-street parking” is parking th at is in a garage or in what we would call a “parking lot” – an area of land specia lly designated to park cars on. There is “street parking” where you park your car o n the side of the road or street, and then there is “off-street parking” wher e you park it in a parking lot or a parking garage. Sasha says, “None,” meaning the res taurant doesn’t have any off-street parking.

“When I called the restaurant earlier today,” she s ays, “I was told they have ample street parking.” “Ample” (ample) means more t han enough, or plenty. Streets are “public,” which means anyone can park t heir car there. So, even if a restaurant says they have a lot of street parking a round them, they can’t reserve that parking – they can’t say, “Well, no one else can park there but our customers.” And so this is the problem that Sasha a nd Alan are having. They are trying to find a place on the street to park near t he restaurant and there doesn’t appear to be any.

Alan says, “Obviously not on a Saturday night,” mea ning the restaurant obviously does not have an ample parking, especially on a bus y night like Saturday. Then

he says, “Look, there’s a space!” He thinks he sees  a place for him to park. Sasha says, “No, look at the curb.” The “curb” (cur b) is a raised concrete border, really, that is on the side of the street. It separ ates the street from the rest of the land, the sidewalk, or the area next to the street that is part of the block. Sasha says, “Look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone.”

Sometimes there will be paint on the curb to tell y ou if you can park there or not. A “loading (loading) zone (zone)” is an area where you can park only for a few minutes in order to take something out of your car or to put something into your car. A “loading zone,” then, would be an area usual ly indicated by yellow paint on the curb, where you can only park for a short amoun t of time. A “red zone” is an area with the curb painted red, where you cannot pa rk at all. Those are areas where if you do park, the police will come and give  you a ticket – give you a fine – or perhaps even remove your car.

Sasha says that there is not a place for them to pa rk on the street, that the place that Alan sees is actually a loading zone and a red  zone. Alan says, “This is impossible. We’ve driven along this street four tim es and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters.” A “meter” (mete r) here refers to a parking meter, where you can park in a certain place but yo u have to pay a certain amount of money for every fifteen or thirty minutes  that you park there. Alan says, “I’d be willing to plug the meter all evening  if we could just find a space.”

“To plug (plug) the meter,” or “to plug the parking  meter,” means to put coins into the parking meters. Nowadays, many parking meters t ake credit cards, but we probably would still use the same expression, “to p lug the meter” – to put coins into the parking meter. Sasha says, “I have an idea . Pull into the red zone.” “To pull into” means to park your car. She’s telling Al an to park the car in the red zone – which, remember, is a place where you’re not  supposed to park. Alan says, “Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that?”

Sasha says, “This is my grandfather’s handicapped p lacard. I borrowed it. We can park here with this.” “Handicapped” (handicappe d) refers to someone who has some sort of physical problem –maybe they have problems walking or they have some other issue that makes them unable to wal k or to move as easily as most people. A “placard” (placard) is a little sign  that you either put in the front part of your car near your window or you hang it fr om what we call your “rear view mirror,” which is the mirror in your car that allows you to see what’s going on behind you.

If you are handicapped, the government will give yo u a special placard, a special card that you can put into your car that will allow  you to park in special places. Usually we call these “handicapped spaces” or “hand icapped parking.” They will also allow you in some cities to park at a parking meter and not pay. However, they never allow you to park in a red zone, but Sas ha somehow thinks that if she uses this handicapped placard of her grandfather, s he can park there. Another thing about a handicapped placard – you are not all owed to use it if you are not handicapped.

But of course, Sasha is using it anyway. Alan says,  “I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parking ticket or worse, and we really sho uldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anyway.” Alan knows that this  is not the right thing to do. He knows also, or at least he should know, that par king in a red zone even with a handicapped placard will get you a parking ticket –  a penalty for parking there. Usually the police will leave a little piece of pap er on your car telling you that you are now going to have to pay a “fine,” an amount of  money as a punishment for parking there.

Sasha says, “Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town?” The expression “to  pull some strings” means to use your power or your influence in order to get so mething done that other people wouldn’t be able to get done. If you want to  get tickets to a concert, and you know somebody who works where the concert is be ing held, you might ask that person for a favor to get you some tickets tha t other people would not be able to get. That would be “pulling some strings.”

Sasha pulled some strings to get a reservation at t he hottest restaurant in town. The word “hottest” here means most popular – the on e that everyone wants to go to right now. Sasha says, “Come on, let’s go. Why a re you checking your wallet?” meaning why are you looking at your wallet, or insi de of your wallet.

Sasha says, “Dinner is my treat.” To say something is your “treat” (treat) means you are going to pay for it. If I say, “I’m going t o invite you to dinner. It’s my treat,” that means I’m going to pay for your dinner. I’m no t, actually, but if you want to invite me to dinner and make it your treat, I’d be happy to go with you. Sasha is wondering why Alan is looking at his wallet since s he is going to pay for dinner. That’s what she means when she says, “Dinner is my treat.”

Alan says, however, “I just want to make sure I hav e enough cash,” enough money, “for a taxi when your car gets towed!” “To t ow” (tow) means to use a truck to take a car and remove it from where it is.  If you park your car in a place where it should not be, sometimes the local police will tow your car. They will get

a truck and they will remove your car, and then you  have to pay a lot of money to get your car back. I know. It’s happened to me. And  if you park in a red zone, even with a handicapped placard, you will also get towed.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alan: We have to find a parking space. Let’s drive around the block one more time. Did you say that the restaurant we’re going t o has no off-street parking at all?

Sasha: None. When I called the restaurant earlier t oday, I was told they have ample street parking.

Alan: Obviously not on a Saturday night. Look, ther e’s a space!

Sasha: No, look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone.

Alan: This is impossible. We’ve driven along this s treet four times and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters. I’d b e willing to plug the meter all evening if we could just find a space.

Sasha: I have an idea. Pull into that red zone.

Alan: Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that?

Sasha: This is my grandfather’s handicapped placard . I borrowed it. We can park here with this.

Alan: I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parkin g ticket or worse, and we really shouldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anywa y.

Sasha: Do you know how many strings I had to pull t o get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town? Come on, let’s go. Why are you checking your wallet? Dinner is my treat.

Alan: I just want to make sure I have enough cash f or a taxi when your car gets towed!

This episode is al l about air and water pollution. Sounds like fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julia: Stop poisoning us! Stop poisoning us!

Robert: Why are you picketing in front of this fact ory?

Julia: This factory is polluting our air and water.  They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemic als and waste.

Robert: But your entire family works here. Aren’t y ou concerned you’ll cause trouble for them and the other workers?

Julia: What’s more important is their health. The a ir quality in and out of this factory is at toxic levels and it’s endangering the ir health, not to mention what it’s doing to the ozone.

Robert: That’s terrible. Maybe I should help you pi cket.

Julia: Here’s a sign.

Robert: Okay, but maybe picketing is taking things a little too far.

Julia: No way! Did you know that runoff from the fa ctory has tainted the groundwater? Did you know that workers and people i n the community are breathing in dangerous particulate matter?

Robert: I didn’t know that. Do you have proof of al l that?

 Julia: Of course I have proof. Environmental groups  have done independent tests.

Robert: Then it’s actually dangerous for me to be s tanding here talking to you and breathing in this toxic air.

Julia: That’s true and your willingness to help me picket is really commendable. Hey, where are you going?

[end of dialogue]

Julia begins our dialogue by shouting – she’s shout ing, saying in a very loud voice – “Stop poisoning us!” “ To poison” (poison) someone is to make someone sick or even kill them by exposing them or giving t hem some sort of dangerous chemicals. Robert asks Julia, “Why are you picketin g in front of this factory?” A “factory” (factory) is a place where things are mad e.“To picket” (picket) means to stand in front of a building, usually carrying sign s and shouting your disagreement about something that is going on insid e the building. Another verb we might use here is “to demonstrate.”

Julia says, “This factory is polluting our air and water.” “To pollute” (pollute) means to make the air, the water, and/or the land d irty and unsafe, usually because you’re using some sort of unhealthy or harm ful substance. We usually refer to polluting the “environment,” the world aro und us – the air, the land, the water that we have in our environment, in the area around us, in the place where we live.

Julia says, “They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemicals and waste.” “To contaminate” (c ontaminate) means to make something unsafe by mixing something in that d oesn’t belong there – something harmful. It’s often used to mean the same  as “to pollute.” Julia is complaining about the company contaminating the env ironment, the natural world, “with dangerous chemicals and waste.”

“Chemical” (chemical) here refers to some sort of s ubstance or material that has been prepared artificially by man, by human beings,  although the word “chemical” has a much broader definition. It could refer to things that you find in nature as well – in the human body, for example. “W aste” (waste) can mean garbage or trash. In general, it refers to things t hat you no longer are using anymore, or perhaps things that are produced when y ou are making something else that you can’t use and you want to get rid of.

 Robert says to Julia, “But your entire family works  here. Aren’t you concerned you’ll cause trouble for them and the other workers ?” Robert is concerned that Julia is picketing a place where her own family mem bers work. Julia is not. She says, “What’s more important is their health.” She’ s saying their health is more important than any harm that could come to them, an y trouble they could get into because she is there picketing.

“The air quality in and out of this factory is at t oxic levels and it’s endangering their health, not to mention what it’s doing to the  ozone.” “Air quality “refers to how clean the air is, if you want to think of it th at way. Big cities like Los Angeles often have poor air quality, although the air quali ty in Los Angeles has gotten a lot better in the past 25 years or so. Julia thinks  the air quality inside as well as outside of the factory is at “toxic levels.” “Toxic ” (toxic) means poisonous, something that could harm you or kill you, like lis tening to Britney Spears, for example –definitely toxic.

Julia says the air quality is endangering her famil y’s health – the ones that work there at the factory. “To endanger” (endanger) mean s to put someone in a situation where they could get harmed or to put som eone in a dangerous situation. Julia thinks that the factory is “endang ering” the health of her family members, “not to mention,” which here means in addi tion to, “what it’s doing to the ozone” (ozone).“Ozone” is a gas, but here Julia  is using “ozone “as a shorter form of “ozone layer,” which is gas that is high up  in the atmosphere.

There is a concern that certain chemicals that we u se here on Earth might damage the ozone layer, and that might cause us fur ther problems here on Earth. Robert says, “That’s terrible. Maybe I shoul d help you picket.” Julia says, “Here’s a sign” (sign).A “sign” is a thick piece of  paper or cardboard or metal that has words or images on it in order to communicate a  certain message. People picketing a company will often walk around with sig ns that are on sticks or pieces of metal, and they hold the signs up in the air so people can see them as they’re driving by or walking by.

Robert says, “Okay, but maybe picketing is taking t hings a little too far.” “To take something too far “means to go beyond the limit of what is acceptable or even what is a good idea in order to get what you want t o get. Julia disagrees. She says, “No way. Did you know that runoff from the fa ctory has tainted the groundwater?” “Runoff” (runoff) is water that drain s away from or flows away from an area of land or a building.

The water could have other chemicals in it – other things that may pollute the water. If the water then goes into a lake or a rive r or down into the ground, it could pollute other water – water that you use to d rink. That’s what Julia is concerned about here. She’s concerned about the “gr oundwater” (groundwater).Groundwater is water that is found fa r below the surface of the earth and that is sometimes used for drinking. Juli a is concerned that the water coming from the factory has “tainted the groundwate r.” “To taint” (taint)here means the same as “to contaminate.”

She says, “Did you know that workers and people in the community are breathing in dangerous particulate matter?” “Particulate (par ticulate) matter” are very small pieces of something. Robert says, “I didn’t know th at. Do you have proof of all that?” “Proof” (proof) is evidence – something that  demonstrates that something is true.

Julia says, “Of course I have proof. I read it on t he Internet.” No, she doesn’t say that. She says, “I have proof. Environmental groups  have done independent tests.” Something that is “independent” (independen t) is separate from the things around it. It’s not connected to the things around it or the organizations around it. Here I’m guessing that she means that these environ mental groups have done tests not in conjunction with, or perhaps even with , the approval of the company that is supposed to be polluting in our dialogue.

Don’t confuse the word “independent” with another t erm, “objective” (objective). “Objective “would refer to something that is just t he facts, that only has the factual information or evidence and isn’t trying to  give you a certain conclusion regardless of what the facts are.“Independent” just  means it was done by someone not in the company, in this case. That pers on may still have their own particular biases, of course.

Robert says, “Then it’s actually dangerous for me t o be standing here talking to you and breathing in this toxic air.” Robert realiz es that if what Julia says is true, he shouldn’t even be there talking to her because t he air is toxic. Julia says, “That’s true and your willingness to help me picket  is really commendable.” “Commendable” (commendable) means admirable or wort hy of praise – something that you would congratulate someone on be cause they are doing a good thing.

Julia is congratulating or thanking Robert for bein g there with her even though it’s dangerous. Then she realizes that Robert is not, in  fact, going to stay there. She says, “Hey, where are you going?”meaning of course that Robert is now walking away from Julia. He’s not going to stand there if h e is going to be in any danger.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Julia: Stop poisoning us! Stop poisoning us!

Robert: Why are you picketing in front of this fact ory?

Julia: This factory is polluting our air and water.  They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemic als and waste.

# Being Boastful

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,184 – Being Boastful.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,184. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. (Yes, that was t he “Star Spangled Banner” of the U.S.A.)

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. You won’t get any music there, but you will be able to download our Learning Guide that has a comp lete transcript of everything we say. We’re also on Facebook. Oh yeah, we are! Go  to facebook.com/eslpod and like us, because we like you.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a story about someone who is very boastful – who likes to talk about how great he is. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

My boss is a complete blowhard. He likes to boast a bout his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he gets. Unfortunatel y, I seem to be his favorite audience.

Boss: You won’t believe what I did over the weekend . I went mountain climbing and skydiving.

What I wanted to say was, “Uh, spare me!” But what I said instead was, “Oh, really? How exciting.” It doesn’t take much encoura gement to get him going.

Boss: And I found time to test-drive the new McQ sp orts car yesterday. I’m thinking of buying one.

Do I really look that gullible? I knew that the bos s didn’t have that kind of money, but I didn’t let it show on my face and simply said , “That’s a very impressive car.”

Boss: I have my eye on a luxury vacation condo by t he lake. Some lucky girl will get to stay there with me.

Now I knew he was blowing smoke, but what could I s ay? I just muttered, “Lucky girl,” and left it at that.

What was the point of all that, unless . . .

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Lucy saying, “My boss is a co mplete blowhard.” A “blowhard” (blowhard) is a person who likes to talk  about why he is so great, a person who likes to “brag” (brag). “To brag” means to talk about your accomplishments in such a way that you want to impr ess other people. You want other people to know how great you are. “He likes t o boast about his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he ge ts,” Lucy says.

Again, she’s talking about her boss who likes “to b oast” (boast). “To boast” means the same as “to brag.” “Accomplishments” (acc omplishments) are things that you have done, good things that you have done because you have worked hard or because of some skill you have. To graduate  from college is an accomplishment. It’s a good thing that you have don e because of your hard work and skill. The boss also likes to boast about his “ acquisitions” (acquisitions).

“Acquisitions” is just a fancy word for things that  you have bought and now own, or things that you have obtained – perhaps, someone  gave it to you – but usually an acquisition is something that you bought. We usu ally use this word in talking about businesses buying other businesses. The verb is “to acquire” (acquire). Interestingly, we also use this term in language de velopment, in talking about how people acquire languages – how they get new lan guages – and we use the noun “acquisition.” But here, we’re talking about a cquiring or getting things.

“Every chance he gets” is an expression that means whenever he has the opportunity – at every possible moment. This could refer to something that is good or bad. It could refer simply to how often you  like to go running. “I go running every chance I get,” meaning every opportun ity I can, I go out and I run, or “I like to eat Italian food every chance I get.”  I like to go to an Italian restaurant whenever I have the opportunity. Well, Lucy’s boss “likes to boast about his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he ge ts.”

She continues, “Unfortunately, I seem to be his fav orite audience.” An “audience” (audience) is someone who is listening to you or wa tching you. Usually we use the word “audience” to refer to a group of people a t a performance. It might be going to a play, or it could also refer to people w atching a movie in a movie theater – we would call that the “audience” – or pe ople watching the same television program at home. In this case, it simply  means the people who are listening to the boss. Then we hear the boss speak (who sounds a lot like me even though I’m not Lucy’s boss).

 The boss says, “You won’t believe what I did over t he weekend.” The expression, “You won’t believe” is when you are about to tell s omeone something that is surprising. “I went mountain climbing and skydiving ,” the boss says. “Mountain climbing” (climbing) is when you go up the side of a mountain, usually holding on to the rocks that are part of the mountain in order  to pull yourself up. I’ve never been mountain climbing, but I did try rock climbing  once, which is similar except you go up the side of a rock, not a mountain.

I tried it for about, oh, 15 minutes. I was with a friend whom I was working with at the university, and her sister – her younger sister , who was very attractive – was visiting her from France, and so we went out to a r ock in the middle of the desert, actually out in what we call the “high desert” here  in Southern California, up by Yucca Valley. We tried to go rock climbing. The you nger sister – now this is before I was married, okay – the younger sister, sh e put on her equipment and she started climbing up, and I thought, “Well, if s he can do it I can do it.”

So I started to climb up the mountain, climb up the  rock, but here I thought, “Well, I have to be strong.” I have to, you know, impress the girl, right? Make her think that I’m a strong man who can climb rocks. And I ha d never gone rock climbing. The point of the story is, I was terrible at it and  I didn’t get more than, like, 10 feet and, well, she went back to France and I never got her telephone number. Let’s just put it that way.

Okay, back to the story. The boss went mountain cli mbing and skydiving. “Skydiving” (skydiving) is when you jump out of a p lane and fall down to the earth, but before you actually hit the earth, you o pen a parachute, which is something that catches the air and prevents you fro m killing yourself. And no, I never went skydiving. So, Lucy’s boss is boasting a bout the things he did this weekend.

She says – to herself, of course – “What I wanted t o say was, ‘Uh, spare me.’” The expression “spare me” means that you don’t want  to hear what the other person has to say. It’s a rude expression. You woul dn’t say it out loud to someone unless you were trying to insult them. We s ay it when someone is telling us something that we don’t believe or that we don’t want to hear.

Lucy continues, “But what I said instead” – instead  of “spare me” – “was, ‘Oh, really? How exciting.’ It doesn’t take much encoura gement to get him going.” “To get someone going” means to get another person to d o something that they like to do or that you want them to do. It means “to enc ourage” (encourage)

someone, to get them to do something. In this case,  it was getting the boss to talk more about himself.

He continues, “And I found time to test drive the n ew McQ sports car yesterday. I’m thinking of buying one.” “To test drive” a car means to go out to a “car dealer,” a business that sells cars, and drive a car to see if you like it or not. Lucy says, “Do I really look that gullible?” “To be gullible” (gullible) means that you are easy to fool. You are easy to trick. It’s easy to make y ou believe something that isn’t true.

Why does Lucy think that the boss thinks that she’s  gullible? Because, she explains, “I knew that the boss didn’t have that ki nd of money,” meaning he didn’t have enough money to buy a McQ sports car, which is  very expensive, you know. She says, “But I didn’t let it show on my fac e,” meaning I didn’t do something that would make him realize that I knew t hat he was lying.” Instead, she simply said, “That’s an impressive car.”

The boss continues, “I have my eye on a luxury vaca tion condo by the lake.” “To have your eye (eye) on” something means you are thi nking about buying something. You are interested in it and you’ve been  investigating it. Maybe you’ve been reading the reviews online about it and  thinking about what you would do if you bought it. The boss has his eye on a “luxury” – meaning a very expensive, a very nice – “vacation condo” (condo).

“Condo” is short for a “condominium.” It’s basicall y an apartment in a building, but you own it. Depending on where you live in the Unit ed States, the word “apartment” is usually just used for a place that y ou are renting. In some cities, perhaps, such as New York, you’ll talk about buying  an apartment. Here in Los Angeles, I think we would say “buying a condo” even  though it might be the exact same thing.

The boss says, “Some lucky girl will get to stay th ere with me.” Lucy then says to herself, “Now I knew he was blowing smoke.” “To blo w smoke” (smoke) is to exaggerate and perhaps to lie – to say something is  either bigger or better than it actually is, or simply not to tell the truth. “What  could I say,” she says, “I just muttered, ‘Lucky girl,’ and left it at that.” “To m utter” (mutter) means to say something quietly so that the other person doesn’t actually hear you. You say it to yourself even though you say it out loud.

Lucy obviously doesn’t think that any girl that wou ld be with her boss is lucky. So she’s being sarcastic when she says “Lucky girl.” S he says she “left it at that.” “To leave it at that” is a phrase we use to mean, “ I’m not going to say anything

else even though I could.” Even though there’s more  I could say, I’m going to stop talking about it right now. At the very end of  the story, she wonders why the boss is boasting to her like this.

Then she perhaps realizes. She says, “What was the point of all that? Unless . . .” The “point” (point) is the purpose, the meaning.  She’s beginning to realize that perhaps the boss is trying to get her interested in  him. Perhaps he is, we would say, “hitting on her.” “To hit on a woman” – or man  – means that you are trying to get the person interested in you. You are trying to  get that person to date you. You know, by going rock climbing with them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

My boss is a complete blowhard. He likes to boast a bout his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he gets. Unfortunatel y, I seem to be his favorite audience.

# Smuggling Across Borders

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,185 – Smuggling across Borders.

This episode is a dialogue between Harry and Christ ina about people who try to bring things or bring people into another country i llegally. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Christina: What is the holdup? There are cars backe d up for half a mile.

Harry: I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugg lers.

Christina: Do you really think so? I wonder if ther e could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.

Harry: It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband. I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.

Christina: Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.

Harry: Or they could be looking for people trying t o import exotic species without permission.

Christina: What kinds of exotic species?

Harry: Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be  brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.

 Christina: Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?

Harry: I doubt if they’re prohibited. Wait, you can ’t leave the car!

Christina: What if this is contraband and they catc h me with it?

Harry: They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way .

Christina: Are you sure?

Harry: Sure, I’m sure. They’d be much more interest ed in the bats I’m smuggling in my pants anyway.

Christina: What?!

[end of dialogue]

Christina says to Harry, “What is the holdup? There  are cars backed up for half a mile.” A “holdup” (holdup) is a source of delay, so mething that slows you down, something that puts you behind schedule. “There’s a  holdup in the front of the line because someone is having a problem with his c redit card.” So the line isn’t moving. Nothing is going forward. A “holdup” is a r eason for something that isn’t happening that should be happening.

I should mention, there’s a very different meaning of “holdup,” which is when people go into a store or a bank and try to get the  money from the store or bank with a gun or some other sort of weapon. That is, i f someone tries to steal money by going into the business, usually with some sort of weapon. It doesn’t even have to be a business. It could be a car or somewhe re else. Here, we’re just talking about a delay.

Christina says, “There are cars backed up for half a mile.” “To be backed (backed) up” means that you have a lot of cars that  are stopped or moving very slowly instead of going at the normal speed on that  particular road or freeway. There are backed-up cars on the freeways of Los Ang eles every day of the week. Harry says, “I bet the Border Patrol is looking for  smugglers.”

Now we understand that Christina and Harry appear t o be entering into another country. Maybe they went to Canada and are returnin g to the United States. Maybe they went to Mexico and are returning to the United States. The “border” (border) is the line that divides two countries. A “patrol” (patrol) is a group of

police officers, soldiers, or government officials who are usually there to prevent crime or to do some sort of inspection. In the U.S. , the Border Patrol is responsible for preventing people and things from c oming into the United States illegally.

If you drive from Canada or Mexico into the United States, you have to stop at the Border Patrol on the border or right inside of the United States, and you will be asked a bunch of questions and they may look ins ide of your car. This happened to me several times as I came back from Me xico. The Border Patrol is sometimes looking for “smugglers” (smugglers). A “s muggler” is a person who tries to bring things or bring people illegally int o another country.

Christina says, “Do you really think so? I wonder i f there could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.” A “drug mule” (mule) is a person who carries illegal drugs from one place to another usu ally by hiding those drugs somewhere on or even in his body. We won’t talk abo ut the places where the drugs may be hidden. “Illegal drugs” are drugs that  are against the law – chemical substances whose sale and or use is agains t the law. Examples would be heroin or cocaine in the United States.

Harry says, “It might be drugs, but it could be any  kind of contraband.” “Contraband” (contraband) is anything that is broug ht into a country illegally. It could be drugs. It could be guns. It could even be electronics or certain kinds of food or cigarettes – anything that is illegal to br ing into another country. Harry continues, “I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.”

“Gunrunning” (gunrunning) is bringing guns and othe r weapons into a country illegally. “Arms” (arms) refers to guns and other w eapons. “Trafficking” (trafficking) is buying and selling things that are  illegal to buy and sell. So “arms trafficking” would be illegally buying and selling guns and other weapons. Sometimes we, sadly, talk about “human trafficking”  – buying and selling of human beings. Such is the world we live in.

Christina says, “Maybe they’re looking for people t rying to sneak into this country without permission.” “To sneak (sneak) into” means to go into somewhere without being seen or observed, usually because you  don’t have permission to go into that place. But it could just be to go into  a place unobserved. Your teenage son may sneak into his room after midnight not wanting you to know that he didn’t get home by the time you told him to be h ome. In this case, we’re talking about people sneaking into a country – goin g into a country without permission and without being seen.

 Harry says, “Or they could be looking for people tr ying to import exotic species without permission.” “To import” (import) means to bring something into another country, usually to sell it in that country. “Speci es” (species) refers to a kind of plant or animal. “Exotic (exotic) species” refers t o species that are not normally found in a given area or a given country. They’re f rom another part of the world or another country. Christina then asks, “What kind s of exotic species?” Harry says, “Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be  brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.”

That’s not a very good definition by Harry of exoti c species. There are plants and animals that you’re not allowed to bring into a cou ntry that are not exotic, meaning that are found normally in that country, bu t for a variety of reasons you’re not allowed to bring them in. This, by the w ay, is also sometimes the case when you go from state to state in the United State s. Normally when you go from one state to another, there is no person there chec king to see if you have certain items that you are bringing into that state, but th ere are exceptions to that.

Here in California, if you drive into the state of California, you will be stopped by a California officer, a government official, who will  ask if you are bringing in certain kinds of plants or fruits. Because California has a  large agriculture industry – that is, it grows a lot of food – it has to be careful t hat you’re not bringing in certain diseases with your plants that would affect the pla nts here in California. Hawaii also has a similar system where they may check to make sure you’re not bringing in certain kinds of fruit or plants into the state of Hawaii when you arrive at the airport.

Harry also mentions animals coming into the country  that cannot be brought in “without quarantine” (quarantine). Certain animals can be brought into a country if they are allowed to spend time separated from ot her animals to make sure that they don’t have any illnesses or diseases. Christin a says, “Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?” “Herbs” are basically plants whose leaves are used to season or flavor food – things like parsley, sag e, rosemary, and thyme – just like the song. You remember? “Parsley, sage, rosema ry, and thyme.” Simon and Garfunkel, people. Look it up on YouTube.

Anyway, Harry says, “I doubt if they’re prohibited. ” If something is “prohibited” (prohibited), it is not allowed. It is forbidden. H arry then says to Christina, “Wait, you can’t leave the car!” Apparently Christina star ts to get out of the car, probably to get rid of her herb plants that she thinks are p rohibited. Christina says, “What if this,” meaning her herbs, “is contraband and they c atch me with it?” meaning they find her with it.

 Harry says, “They’ll confiscate it and send us on o ur way.” “To confiscate” (confiscate) is to take something from another pers on because you have the legal right to do so. A teacher may confiscate a st udent’s cell phone if he’s using the cell phone in class against the rules of the sc hool. The police may confiscate illegal guns or drugs if they find you with them. “ To send someone on his way” means to simply let someone leave without doing any thing to them, without stopping them – to release someone whom you could h ave kept but decided not to.

In this case, Harry is saying that the people at the border – who in this case would be the customs officials, I think – would con fiscate or take the illegal items but would not arrest them. They would let the peopl e go – in this case, let Christina go. Christina says, “Are you sure?” Harry  says, “Sure, I’m sure,” meaning yes, I’m sure. The officials, Harry says, w ould be much more interested in the bats he is smuggling in his pants.

A “bat” (bat) is a small flying mammal – kind of li ke a mouse with wings that flies at night. You know Batman? Well, Batman is based on  the animal called a “bat.” And apparently Harry has bats in his pants, which s ounds very painful, that he is trying to bring illegally into the country. He’s tr ying to smuggle them into the country. Christina apparently didn’t know that and is quite surprised at the end of the dialogue, as are all of us.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Christina: What is the holdup? There are cars backe d up for half a mile.

Harry: I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugg lers.

Christina: Do you really think so? I wonder if ther e could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.

Harry: It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband. I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.

Christina: Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.

 Harry: Or they could be looking for people trying t o import exotic species without permission.

Christina: What kinds of exotic species?

Harry: Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be  brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.

Christina: Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?

Harry: I doubt if they’re prohibited. Wait, you can ’t leave the car!

Christina: What if this is contraband and they catc h me with it?

Harry: They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way .

Christina: Are you sure?

Harry: Sure, I’m sure. They’d be much more interest ed in the bats I’m smuggling in my pants anyway.

Christina: What?!

# Being in a Severe Storm

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,186 – Being in a Severe Storm.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,186. Eleven hundred eighty-six. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, comi ng to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. You can download a  Learning Guide when you go to our website, for this episode and all of our recent episodes, that contains a complete transcript of everything I say.

This episode is a dialogue about being in a severe or serious storm. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shana: Hey, did you hear that? There’s a severe sto rm coming. Let’s hope for the best.

Aecio: Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of damag e. We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.

Shana: No, when I said I was hoping for the best, I  meant I’m hoping to catch it on film. The weather forecaster says that their rad ar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.

Aecio: Let me get this straight. You’re hoping for a big storm?

Shana: Yeah, I’m a storm chaser. I’ve captured lots  of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurricane or typhoon.

Aecio: You mean you actually chase after storms?

Shana: Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there f or a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.

Aecio: You understand that with big storms come str ong winds and floods, resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.

Shana: I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m just lo oking for a thrill.

 Aecio: Right, just a little harmless fun!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Shana asking Aecio, “Hey d id you hear that? There’s a severe storm coming.” Anything that is “severe” (se vere) is serious or, in this case, very strong. A “severe storm” (storm) would b e a serious weather event, often one that comes with strong winds and heavy ra in, although you could also have a “severe snowstorm,” where you get a lot of s now in a short period of time. Shana says, “Let’s hope for the best,” meaning let’ s hope things don’t get too bad.

Aecio says, “Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of  damage,” meaning I hope the storm doesn’t cause too much harm – doesn’t, for ex ample, cause any houses to fall down or any buildings to lose their roofs. He says, “We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.” “Afterma th” (aftermath) is what happens after something else, usually the bad things or neg ative consequences of something. The “aftermath of a storm” would be what  happens after there’s a big storm. “In the aftermath of the big storm, the pric e of gasoline went up because it wasn’t easy to get gasoline in that area.”

Shana says, “No, when I said I was hoping for the b est, I meant I’m hoping to catch it on film.” “To catch it” means to be able t o video the event or to use your camera to make a movie of it. She says, “The weathe r forecaster says that their radar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.” A “weather forecaster” (forecaster) is a person who tries to predict what the weather will be in the future, which is always a very difficult thing to do.

“Radar” (radar) is a technology that allows a machi ne to detect the speed of things that cannot be seen by your eyes or that can not easily be observed or noticed. In an airport, they use radar to keep trac k of all of the airplanes that are flying in out of the airport to make sure that they  don’t hit each other. Radar can also be used to see where the clouds are and where it is raining. The weather forecaster uses radar to try to figure out what the  weather will be in the near future.

In the dialogue, Shana says the weather forecaster’ s radar “has detected a big cyclone.” “To detect” (detect) means to see, notice , or observe something that would not otherwise be seen. The radar has detected  – or noticed or seen or indicated on its screen – “a big cyclone” (cyclone) . A “cyclone”is a kind of storm that has winds that go around in a circle. Usually we use this word “cyclone” to

refer to a “tropical storm” – a storm that is comin g off from the ocean onto the land.

When cyclone refers to a tropical storm, it’s usual ly called a “hurricane” if it is in the Atlantic Ocean and a “typhoon”(typhoon) if it i s in the Western Pacific or Indian Oceans. Aecio says, “Let me get this straigh t, you’re hoping for a big storm?” The expression “to get something straight” (straight) means to understand something completely. Usually we use thi s expression when someone is explaining something to you and perhaps at first you’re not really clear about what that person is saying, and so you want to repeat what the person is saying in your own words to make sure you  really understand it.

It may also be used when you are so surprised by so mething that someone is telling you that you can’t really believe it’s true , and so you’re repeating it or you’re summarizing it so that you’re sure you under stand it. In this case, Aecio is surprised that Shana actually wants there to be a b ig storm. That’s why he says, “Let me get this straight, you’re hoping for a big storm?” Shana says, “Yeah, I’m a storm chaser.”

Someone who “chases” (chases) someone is someone wh o goes after another person, who tries to catch another person. A “storm  chaser” (chaser) is a person who follows storms, usually to take videos of them or photographs of the storm. There are some people who like to chase “tornadoes”  (tornadoes). A “tornado” is a storm that has clouds that move quickly in a circ le, in what is called a “funnel” (funnel) which is a cone-like shape. You have torna does over land that are usually only going to last a certain amount of time . It’s not like a cyclone. A cyclone is a larger storm that can last for days.

Shana says she’s a storm chaser. She says, “I’ve ca ptured lots of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurr icane or typhoon.” Shana says that she has been able to make a video of tropical storms and even a small tornado, but never a “hurricane” (hurricane) or typ hoon. Remember, a “hurricane” is a cyclone that is in the Atlantic Ocean. A “typh oon” is a cyclone in the Indian or Pacific Oceans.

In the United States, we used to give hurricanes, s torms coming out of the Atlantic Ocean, names of women. But more recently, they’ve started giving men’s names to hurricanes as well because men want to be equal to women when it comes to storms, I guess. I don’t know. Typhoons are also given names, but there the system is much more complicated. It isn’t  just the name of a man or woman.

Back to our story, Aecio says, “You mean you actual ly chase after storms?” Shana says, “Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be t here for a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.” The “eye ” of a cyclone is the central part of the hurricane or a typhoon where the wind i s moving around you. You’re in the middle of where the wind is moving. Apparent ly, in the eye of a cyclone, it is “calm” (calm), meaning there aren’t any strong w inds.

Aecio says, “You understand that with big storms co me strong winds and floods resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.” Aecio is reminding Shana that these large storms cause a lot of proble ms. They have strong winds – that is, strong movement of air – and can also caus e “floods” (floods). A “flood” is when the water in a river goes on to the surroundin g land where it doesn’t normally go. This results in the “destruction (dest ruction) of homes.”

“Destruction” comes from the verb “to destroy” (des troy), which means to cause damage to something so that it no longer exists or it no longer has the same shape or form. If you destroy a home, you take the walls down so that the home is no longer standing. You can no longer use it. “C haos” (chaos) refers to confusion or disorder. These storms can cause “gene ral chaos,” meaning lots of problems in a certain area.

Shana says, “I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m j ust looking for a thrill.” A “thrill” (thrill) is a feeling of excitement. It’s something  that is pleasurable because perhaps it’s a little dangerous and you like a litt le danger. A thrill can simply be, however, something that is very exciting. It doesn’ t have to be dangerous. But the thrill that Shana is seeking is definitely a da ngerous one, not only to her but to other people.

That’s why Aecio at the end says, “Right, just a li ttle harmless fun!” Something that is “harmless” (harmless) is something that wil l not cause problems, something that will not cause harm. Aecio is being sarcastic here. He’s making a joke. He’s saying that these storms cause a lot of problems and that you shouldn’t hope for a big storm because the storm co uld cause destruction of houses and general chaos, which would not be a good  thing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shana: Hey, did you hear that? There’s a severe sto rm coming. Let’s hope for the best.

Aecio: Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of damag e. We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.

Shana: No, when I said I was hoping for the best, I  meant I’m hoping to catch it on film. The weather forecaster says that their rad ar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.

Aecio: Let me get this straight. You’re hoping for a big storm?

Shana: Yeah, I’m a storm chaser. I’ve captured lots  of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurricane or typhoon.

Aecio: You mean you actually chase after storms?

Shana: Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there f or a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.

Aecio: You understand that with big storms come str ong winds and floods, resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.

Shana: I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m just lo oking for a thrill.

# Visiting Churches, Mosques, and Temples

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,187 – Visiting Churches, Mosques, and Temples.

This episode is a dialogue between Cassius and Brit tany about visiting holy places – churches, mosques, and temples. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cassius: You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship.

Brittany: All right, if you say so. I don’t really want to go into this mosque or temple or whatever it is.

Cassius: Keep your voice down. Can’t you see that t here are people at the altar in prayer?

Brittany: I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk o ver to that building over there with the dome and steeple.

Cassius: That’s not a steeple. It’s a minaret, and that’s a mosque. You’re definitely not going in there dressed like that.

Brittany: Why not? I’m curious about other religion s. I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures.

Cassius: These are holy places. You can’t just barg e into a house of worship to satisfy your curiosity.

Brittany: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods. I’m very interested in the local culture.

Cassius: Would you like a tourist coming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer?

Brittany: I don’t belong to a church, but if I did,  I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look.

Cassius: Other members of your congregation might n ot feel that way, but do what you like. I’ll be right here ready to dust you  off when they give you the boot!

[end of dialogue]

Cassius begins our dialogue by saying to Brittany, “You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship.” T he phrasal verb “to cover up” means to cover some part of your body – to hide you r face or to hide your hair or perhaps to hide your arms and legs. Sometimes women  especially are asked to cover up when they enter a certain building that is  used for a religious purpose. A building used for religious purposes is often calle d a “house of worship” (worship).

A house of worship is a building where people come to pray. It is also used for religious ceremonies or religious celebrations. Bri ttany says, “All right, if you say so,” meaning if that’s what you’re telling me to do . “I don’t really want to go in to this mosque or temple or whatever it is.” She doesn ’t seem to be sure if the building is a “mosque” (mosque) or a “temple” (temp le). A “mosque” is a building where Muslims worship together, pray together. The verb “to worship” can mean to participate in a religious ceremony or a religio us event of some kind.

Muslims worship in a mosque. A “temple” (temple) is  used for describing a house of worship for Jews, though it could also be used f or Mormons. We talk about a “Mormon temple.” That’s the house of worship of tho se who believe in the religion of Mormonism. But more commonly, it’s used  to refer to a place where Jews worship, which is also called a “synagogue” (s ynagogue). Brittany is unsure whether she’s going into a mosque or a temple.

Cassius just says, “Keep your voice down.” That exp ression “keep your voice down” means don’t talk too loudly. “Can’t you see t hat there are people at the altar in prayer?” An “altar” (altar) is a kind of f urniture, I guess we could describe it, that is used in certain religious ceremonies or  sacrifices. In a Christian church, the altar would be in front of the building, typica lly. In some Christian churches, the altar looks like a big table, but in older chur ches, especially Catholic churches, the altar is up against the front wall of  the church.

Cassius talks about people at the altar “in prayer”  – that is, they are speaking to God, perhaps thanking God or praising God or asking  God for something. Brittany says, “I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk over to that building over there with the dome and steeple.” A “dome” (dome) is a ta ll, rounded top of a building. Sometimes churches and other houses of worship have  domes on top of them. But a dome can be on any kind of building. The U.S.  Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., is famous for its dome.

A “steeple” (steeple) is a tall tower, or what we m ight call a “spire” (spire) that is often used in Christian architecture – in buildings  that are built for Christian worship. Brittany points to something thinking that  it’s a dome and a steeple. But Cassius corrects her. He says, “That’s not a steepl e. It’s a minaret, and that a mosque.” A particular kind of tower associated with  a mosque is called a “minaret” (minaret). It’s a tall, narrow tower typi cally found with a mosque.

Cassius says, “You’re definitely not going in there  dressed like that.” It is likely that Brittany is not dressed appropriately to go in to this mosque. Brittany says, “Why not? I’m curious about other religions” – othe r organized systems of belief. “I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures.” “To take pictures” means to take photographs. Cassius says, “These are  holy (holy) places.” Something that is “holy” is something that is dedic ated to or connected to God or some supernatural power or being. “To be holy” mean s to be “sacred” (sacred).

The idea is that you would treat that with special respect. Cassius says, “You can’t just barge into a house of worship to satisfy  your curiosity.” “To barge (barge) into” somewhere is to enter a place suddenl y and loudly, often without permission to do so. If you barge into a meeting, y ou interrupt the meeting. You go in there making a bunch of noise and disturbing the people who are there already.

Cassius says, “You can’t just barge into a house of  worship” – that is, a temple, a mosque, or a church – “to satisfy your curiosity.” “To satisfy your curiosity” (curiosity) means to find the answers to your quest ions about something. “Curiosity” is wanting to know about something, wan ting to know the answer to some question. So, “satisfying your curiosity” is g etting the answer or trying to get the answer for your questions.

Brittany says, “I don’t think there’s anything wron g with me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods.” The word “God ” (God), when it is capitalized (when it has a large letter) usually re fers to a single, supernatural power – what we would call a “deity” (deity), which  comes from the Latin word

“dues,” meaning “God.” Sometimes you will see the w ord “God” written as a small (god), often with an “s” to make it plural so  it’s “gods.”

Christians, Jews, and Muslims usually refer to thei r God in the singular, with no “s” at the end and a capital “G,” but you could ref er to, say, “gods of other religions.” These gods may still be supernatural in  their own belief systems. We could talk about the gods of the Greeks and the Rom ans, for example, who were in Greek and Roman religion considered supernatural  but there was more than one of them. I’ve been using the word “supernatural ” (supernatural). “Supernatural” means beyond our human experience an d power, beyond our nature.

Brittany thinks she should be able to go into any p lace she wants “to observe local people,” as she calls them. She says, “I’m ve ry interested in the local culture.” “Local” here means of this particular are a or place. Cassius says, “Would you like a tourist” – someone visiting – “co ming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer?” “To  be in prayer,” or “to be at prayer,” means to be praying – to be involved in the act of speaking to or listening to God. Brittany says, “I don’t belong to  a church, but if I did, I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look.”

She means that even though she isn’t a member of a church, if she were a member of a church, she would welcome – she would b e happy to have – people come in and look. Cassius says, “Other members of y our congregation might not feel that way, but do what you like.” A “congregati on” (congregation) is a group of people who meet regularly at a particular house of worship to pray. Cassius says that if Brittany were a member of a church, the oth er people who go to that church, the “congregation,” might not agree with he r.

Cassius says, “I’ll be right here to dust you off w hen they give you the boot!” “To dust (dust) someone off” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning to help someone who has fallen down by literally brushing off the d irt or the dust on the person’s clothing that got there because of their fall. In a  more general way, in a more figurative way, we could say, “to dust someone off”  means to help someone back from a difficult situation or from a challenging si tuation – to help someone recover.

“To give someone the boot” (boot) means to force so meone to leave an organization or to leave a place. A “boot” is somet hing you wear on your feet. It’s a kind of heavy shoe. Literally, “to give someone t he boot” would be to kick them in their behind – in their rear, in their butt – to  get them to leave the building. But it’s used, again, more figuratively to refer to get ting rid of someone, to forcing

someone to leave a certain building or place. It co uld also refer to a company firing you, getting rid of you as an employee.

But here Cassius refers to the situation in which B rittany might find herself if she goes into a church, mosque, or temple without permi ssion. They may kick her out of the house of worship. At least, I think that’s w hat Cassius is saying. He might be referring to the hypothetical, the imaginary sit uation in which Brittany Becomes a member of a church and invites people to come in and the other members of the congregation disagree with her and k ick her out of that church. I’m not sure.

In any case, let’s listen to the dialogue now at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cassius: You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship.

Brittany: All right, if you say so. I don’t really want to go into this mosque or temple or whatever it is.

Cassius: Keep your voice down. Can’t you see that t here are people at the altar in prayer?

Brittany: I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk o ver to that building over there with the dome and steeple.

Cassius: That’s not a steeple. It’s a minaret, and that’s a mosque. You’re definitely not going in there dressed like that.

Brittany: Why not? I’m curious about other religion s. I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures.

Cassius: These are holy places. You can’t just barg e into a house of worship to satisfy your curiosity.

Brittany: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods. I’m very interested in the local culture.

Cassius: Would you like a tourist coming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer?

 Brittany: I don’t belong to a church, but if I did,  I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look.

Cassius: Other members of your congregation might n ot feel that way, but do what you like. I’ll be right here ready to dust you  off when they give you the boot!

This episode is a dialogue between James and Vicky about television ads for children. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

James: Look at that! It’s commercial after commerci al. It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids.

Vicky: They’re just doing their job, marketing to a  lucrative demographic.

James: But just look at what our kids are bombarded  with: toy commercials and junk food ads!

Vicky: Children’s television is no different from a ny other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life.

James: But don’t you think it’s wrong to manipulate  young viewers with these commercials? Aren’t they more susceptible to false advertising?

Vicky: Shh! That’s our company’s product commercial . It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?

James: Yeah, it’s grand, just grand.

[end of dialogue]

James begins our dialogue by saying to Vicky, “Look  at that! It’s commercial after commercial.” A “commercial” (commercial) is a comme rcial advertisement. The word “commercial” refers to making money in this ca se, or businesses. However,

we use the word “commercial” nowadays to mean the s ame as an “advertisement,” which is some sort of announcement  on television, radio, or nowadays YouTube that tries to get you to do someth ing or to buy something – usually to buy something.

James is talking about all of the commercials on te levision. He says, “It’s commercial after commercial,” meaning first there’s  one commercial, then there’s another one. He’s complaining about how many commer cials there are. He says, “It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids .” “Advertisers” are the people who pay for the commercials – the ads or advertisem ents. It could be a company – it usually is – but it could also be an organizat ion.

Advertisers, according to James, are “going after k ids.” “To go after” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to try to influence a par ticular group of people or to try to get your message to a particular group of pe ople. In this case, the group of people are “kids” (kids). “Kids” are children. Vick y says, “They’re just doing their job.” She’s referring to these advertisers. These a dvertisers are “just doing their job.” In other words, they’re not trying to do anyt hing bad. They’re just doing what they’re supposed to do.

And what exactly is their job? According to Vicky, it’s “marketing to a lucrative demographic.” “Marketing” (marketing) comes from the verb “to market” (market) which means to get people to know about your produc t or service, usually so that they will buy more of whatever it is you’re selling . “To market” isn’t exactly the same as “to advertise.” “Marketing” refers to anyth ing you do to get people to become aware of or to know about your product or se rvice. “Advertising” is one way that you can market your product or service.

Advertising refers usually to paying a television s tation or a website to put some sort of announcement – an “ad” – about your product  or service. So, advertising is one way of marketing your product to get people aware of your product. Vicky is talking about these companies “marketing to a lu crative demographic.” “Lucrative” (lucrative) means very profitable, some thing you can make a lot of money from. You might describe playing professional  sports, like professional baseball or professional soccer, as being “lucrativ e.” You can get a lot of money doing that.

A “demographic” (demographic) as a noun refers to a  section or group of people who have similar characteristics. It could be a gro up of women. It could be a group of children. It could be a group of people wh o are all learning English. Those are all examples of “demographics” – groups w ithin a larger population. Children are a “lucrative demographic” according to  Vicky, meaning that

companies can make a lot of money from them. Of cou rse, they’re really making the money from their parents.

James says, “But just look at what our kids are bom barded with: toy commercials and junk food ads.” “To bombard” (bombard) can mean  to drop bombs – explosive devices – on a certain area, but it’s use d more commonly nowadays to refer to the act of sending lots of different messa ges or images to a certain group of people over and over again – so many that this g roup can’t pay attention or think about anything else.

You might say, for example, that advertisers “bomba rd you with emails” to get you to buy things from them, or that you are “bomba rded with requests” from people at your company to help them with their proj ects. Notice we use the proposition “with.” You are “bombarded with” someth ing. Well, in this case we’re talking about children who are “bombarded with ads”  – advertisements – advertisements for toys and junk food.

“Toys” are objects designed to entertain and amuse children. “Junk (junk) food” refers to food that doesn’t have a lot of nutrition al value, that tastes good but usually isn’t very good for your body – things like  McDonald’s hamburgers, for example. Vicky responds, “Children’s television is no different from any other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life ,” she says. “Children’s television” refers, of course, to television progra ms or shows that are made for children.

“Programming” here refers to the kinds of TV shows or movies that are shown on a particular channel or a particular station on tel evision. “A fact of life” is something that you have to accept, something that i s very common and you can’t change. Usually we use this expression “a fact of l ife” when we are referring to something that isn’t very pleasant, isn’t very nice , but that you can’t avoid. If you live in Los Angeles, traffic – lots of cars on the road – is “a fact of life.” If you want to live here, you just have to understand that and put up with it. You have to tolerate it.

James says, “But don’t you think it’s wrong to mani pulate young viewers with these commercials?” “To manipulate” (manipulate) me ans to change or influence someone, but usually in a negative way by using som e sort of secret or hidden approach or tactic. If someone “manipulates” you, t hat person is trying to get you to do something, say something, or think something by, in a way, tricking you or not telling you that he’s trying to get you to chan ge your mind or to think in a certain way.

We don’t like to be manipulated by other people. We  don’t like other people to try to get us to say something or do something by a way  that isn’t honest, that isn’t open. James thinks that these advertisers are “mani pulating young viewers” (viewers). A “viewer” is a person that views or wat ches, in this case, television programs. If you are listening to the radio or to a  podcast, you are a “listener.” For a television program you would be a “viewer,” e ven though of course you’re also listening to the television program as well as  watching it or “viewing” it.

James asks, “Aren’t they,” meaning children, “more susceptible to false advertising?” “To be susceptible” (susceptible) mea ns to be easily influenced or affected by someone or something – influenced in su ch a way that something negative will happen, something bad will happen to you. James is worried that children are “susceptible to false advertising.” “F alse advertising” would be advertising that tells lies, which some people thin k refers to almost all advertising. But that’s not true, of course.

Vicky says, “Shh!” She’s telling James to be quiet.  “That’s our company’s product commercial. It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?” Now we understand, at the end of this dialogue, that Vicky works for a compan y that has advertisements for children on television. She says, “That’s our compa ny’s product (product) commercial.” The word “product” usually refers to a  physical object that you sell. Some companies sell products. Some companies sell s ervices. They don’t give you anything physical, but they do something for yo u.

James says at the end, “Yeah, it’s grand, just gran d.” The word “grand” (grand) usually means wonderful or great. But here, James i s being sarcastic. He’s using the word in one way to mean something the opposite.  He’s trying to make a joke by saying, “Oh yeah, it’s grand.” But the way he sa ys it indicates that he’s making a joke. He doesn’t like the idea, I guess, that Vic ky’s company advertises to children.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

James: Look at that! It’s commercial after commerci al. It’s terrible how advertisers are going after kids.

Vicky: They’re just doing their job, marketing to a  lucrative demographic.

James: But just look at what our kids are bombarded  with: toy commercials and junk food ads!

 Vicky: Children’s television is no different from a ny other type of programming. Commercials are a fact of life.

James: But don’t you think it’s wrong to manipulate  young viewers with these commercials? Aren’t they more susceptible to false advertising?

Vicky: Shh! That’s our company’s product commercial . It really gets your attention, doesn’t it?

James: Yeah, it’s grand, just grand.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogues on ESL Podcast are just grand – and I  say that not to be sarcastic, but to say that they really are wonderful. Thanks t o our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.

This episode is a dialogue between Nancy and Gerald o about sentencing a criminal – giving someone who has broken the law a punishment. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Hey, where have you been?

Geraldo: I’ve been in the other courtroom watching the sentencing of that murderer.

Nancy: Which murderer?

Geraldo: The one who failed to get the charges redu ced through a plea agreement. During the trial, her attorneys tried to  show that there were mitigating circumstances, but the judge didn’t buy it.

Nancy: Didn’t she commit two murders?

Geraldo: That’s right. The judge sentenced her to 3 5 years to life in prison for each crime.

Nancy: Will she serve them consecutively or concurr ently?

Geraldo: She’ll be serving them consecutively, so e ven with time off for good behavior, she’ll be spending the next 50 years or s o in prison.

Nancy: So her only hope now is an appeal, right?

 Geraldo: That’s right. I’ll be following this case for a long time to come.

Nancy: And getting lots of good copy.

Geraldo: Of course. What would we crime reporters d o without juicy murders?

[end of dialogue]

Nancy asks Geraldo, “Hey, where have you been?” Ger aldo says, “I’ve been in the other courtroom watching the sentencing of that  murderer.” A “courtroom” (courtroom) is a large room where what are called “ trials” (trials) and other legal procedures or processes take place. A “courtroom” i s a place typically where you will go if you commit a crime and the police find y ou and arrest you – you will have to appear in front of a “judge” (judge). A jud ge is a person who works for the government, who is in charge of, or who runs, legal  trials and processes that are involved in carrying out the law.

A “courtroom” is typically found in a place called a “courthouse” (courthouse). A courthouse isn’t an actual house that you live in, but is rather a building that is used for housing, if you will, courtrooms and judge s and lawyers who work for the government. Geraldo was in a courtroom “watching the sentencing of that murderer,” he says. “To sentence” (sentence) as a v erb means to give someone a punishment – usually for the government to assign  or give a punishment to someone who has done something wrong.

A “murderer” (murderer) is a person who murders – t hat is, kills someone unlawfully – someone who has broken the law by kill ing another person. Interestingly, just because you kill another person , you end another person’s life, doesn’t mean that you will be arrested. If the othe r person, for example, was trying to kill you and you were defending yourself,  we wouldn’t call you a “murderer” in that case, even though you did kill t he person who tried to kill you. Anyway, Nancy asks Geraldo, “Which murderer?” meani ng which murderer is he talking about.

Geraldo answers, “The one” – meaning the murderer –  “who failed to get the charges reduced through a plea agreement.” There are several expressions there we need to explain. Let’s start with the verb  “to fail to get” something.” “To fail (fail) to get” something means you don’t get s omething. You are not successful at obtaining something. The word “charge s” (charges) refers to the things that the government accuses you of. For exam ple, if you steal something,

you will be “charged” with a crime of theft. The “c harge” is what the government says you did wrong.

Now, sometimes you can commit a crime – you can bre ak the law – and the government will not accuse you of doing exactly wha t you did. They may charge you with a lesser crime, perhaps because they don’t  have evidence to prove that you committed the crime, the more serious crime tha t they could charge you with, or there may be some other reason why the governmen t decides it isn’t going to charge you with a more serious crime and charges yo u with a lesser crime.

So, the word “charge” can be used as a verb referri ng to when the government accuses you of something, as well as a noun referri ng to what it is that the government accused you of. I hope that makes sense.  In this case, Geraldo is talking about a murderer who “failed” – who wasn’t successful – “to get the charges reduced.” “To reduce” (reduce) can mean to make something smaller, to make something less than what it was. “To have your  charges reduced” means to have the government accuse you of a less serious  crime. Murder is a very serious crime.

The government may say, “Well, we’re not going to c harge you with murder. We’re going to charge you with something less serio us.” Now Geraldo is talking about a murderer who failed to get his charges redu ced – that is, the government did not reduce his charges. They did not say that h e committed a lesser crime. Many times the government will charge you with a le sser crime through a particular kind of agreement called a “plea (plea) agreement.”

The verb “to plea” is used to refer to what you say  to the government when the government accuses you of a crime. You can either s ay, “Yes, I did it,” or you can say, “No, I’m innocent.” Most people, of course , say they’re innocent. When the government charges you with something, you have  to say, “I am innocent” or “I am guilty.” That statement is your “plea.” It’s what you are saying in response to the government’s accusation or charge against yo u.

A “plea agreement,” then, is when usually you say t o the government, “Okay, I will say that I am guilty of this crime” – usually a crime that is less serious than the one that you actually committed. The government  does this often so that it doesn’t have to go through an entire trial. It does n’t have to prove that you are guilty. That can take a long time and be very expen sive. So instead, the government says, “Okay, we know you committed murde r, but instead of saying that you committed murder, you say that you committ ed a lesser crime, a less serious crime.”

For example, there’s a crime called “manslaughter” (manslaughter). “Manslaughter” is when you say that you killed some one but you didn’t mean to kill them or you didn’t do it on purpose. That woul d be an example of a plea agreement. Let’s continue with our story. Geraldo s ays, “During the trial, her attorneys tried to show that there were mitigating circumstances, but the judge didn’t buy it.” So I guess we’re talking about a wo man who murdered someone, not a man. I think I referred to this person as a m an earlier.

In any case, Geraldo refers to the “trial” (trial).  The trial is the series of meetings in a courtroom during which the government tries to  prove that you committed a crime, usually, and you try to convince the judge t hat you didn’t commit a crime. Often in U.S. trials, it’s not the judge who makes the final decision but the “jury” (jury). The jury is a group of people, usually 12 i n number, who decide if you are guilty or innocent of a crime.

However, many times the jury only decides if you are guilty or innocent. The “judge” – a man or a woman who works for the govern ment – decides how you will be punished, how you will be sentenced. In thi s case, during the trial the attorneys, the lawyers who work for this woman accu sed of murder, tried to show that there were “mitigating circumstances.”

“Mitigating (mitigating) circumstances” refer to si tuations that may make your crime less serious, or at least your guilt less ser ious. For example, you may be hungry and have no food and no job and no place to live, and because of this, you steal some food. Well, stealing food is a crime , but the judge might decide there were “mitigating circumstances” – things that , even though you did commit the crime, mean that you shouldn’t be punished as s everely or as heavily.

But in this case the judge didn’t agree, in the cas e of the murderer, that there were mitigating circumstances for her crime. “The j udge didn’t,” according to Geraldo, “buy it.” “To buy (buy) it” means to belie ve what someone said, to accept the truth of what someone has told you. Nanc y asks Geraldo, “Didn’t she commit two murders?” Geraldo says, “That’s right. T he judge sentenced her to 35 years to life in prison for each crime.” “35 yea rs to life” means the person has to go to jail, to prison, for at least 35 years, bu t maybe as long as the person lives – in other words, until the person dies.

Nancy says, “Will she serve them consecutively or c oncurrently?” Because the murderer committed two murders, the judge gave her two punishments. The punishment for each murder was 35 years to life. No w, the question Nancy asks is “Does the murderer have to serve these sentences ,” that is undergo these punishments, “consecutively (consecutively) or conc urrently (concurrently)?”

 “Consecutively” means one after the other, meaning first you serve 35 years for this murder, then you serve 35 years for the next m urder – in other words, 70 years in total. “Concurrently” means that you are d oing two things at the same time. So the two sentences of 35 years are served a t the same time, not one after the other. If you commit multiple crimes, you  may be sentenced to serve the punishments consecutively or concurrently. Obviousl y, if you serve them consecutively, you will be in prison for a lot long er than if you serve them concurrently.

Geraldo says, “She’ll be serving them consecutively ,” meaning one after the other, “so even with time off for good behavior, sh e’ll be spending the next 50 years or so in prison.” Okay, so what does all this  mean? Well, sometimes you are given a punishment, but if you don’t cause any problems in prison, you can be released from prison – you can be let out of pri son – a little earlier than you would have otherwise, if you had served, or stayed in prison for, the entire time of your punishment. This is called “getting time off f or good behavior.”

“Time off” means that the number of years that you have to spend in prison is reduced because you didn’t cause any problems, any more problems, when you were actually in prison. So, in this case the murde rer will have to spend at least 50 years in prison even if she behaves herself, eve n if she gets those 35-year sentences reduced due to good behavior.

Nancy says, “So her only hope now is an appeal, rig ht?” In the U.S. court system, even when the judge says that you did somet hing wrong and sentences you to prison, you can “appeal” the decision to a h igher court. You can only do that if you think that the judge made a mistake or that there was some problem with your trial. An “appeal” (appeal), then, is an attempt to get a higher court – a more powerful court, if you will – to decide that t here was something wrong with your original trial or that the judge made a mistak e. And this happens quite a bit. It happens quite often.

Geraldo says, “Yes, that’s right.” Her only hope no w – that is, her only hope not to spend the next 50 years in prison – is an appeal . Geraldo says, “I’ll be following this case for a long time to come,” meani ng for a long time. Nancy says, “And getting lots of good copy.” “Copy” (copy) here  refers to text that will be published or shared with readers. Usually we refer to “copy” when we’re talking about a news story. It’s the actual writing that yo u read when you read a newspaper. We also use the word “copy” when referri ng to writing in an advertisement or a commercial.

 Geraldo says, “Of course. What would we crime repor ters do without juicy murders?” A “crime reporter” is a journalist whose job it is to report on, or to tell people about, crimes. “Juicy” (juicy) here means ve ry interesting, but interesting because it is also scandalous. Something that is “s candalous” (scandalous) is something that will cause you to be upset or angry or shocked.

So, a “juicy murder” would be a murder that is surr ounded by circumstances that might also cause you to be shocked or upset – somet hing terrible happened. Of course, murder is terrible in and of itself – by it self it’s terrible – but it might be a murder that is connected to some sort of sex scanda l or some sort of crazy behavior – something that might happen, say, here i n Hollywood.

Now let’s listen to this dialogue, this time at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Hey, where have you been?

Geraldo: I’ve been in the other courtroom watching the sentencing of that murderer.

Nancy: Which murderer?

Geraldo: The one who failed to get the charges redu ced through a plea agreement. During the trial, her attorneys tried to  show that there were mitigating circumstances, but the judge didn’t buy it.

Nancy: Will she serve them consecutively or concurr ently?

Nancy: So her only hope now is an appeal, right?

Geraldo: That’s right. I’ll be following this case for a long time to come.

Nancy: And getting lots of good copy.

 Geraldo: Of course. What would we crime reporters d o without juicy murders?

The dialogue today is between Walt and Francesca ab out problems with your feet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Walt: What are you doing?

Francesca: I’m selecting and organizing my photos f or a presentation.

Walt: Oh, can I see? All of these photos are of fee t!

Francesca: Well, I am a podiatrist and I’m giving a  talk about foot conditions.

Walt: Ew, some of these are really disgusting!

Francesca: You’re looking at some of the most commo n foot conditions: blisters, corns, bunions, calluses, and athlete’s foot.

Walt: What is that?

Francesca: That’s an ingrown toenail and those are infected toenails.

Walt: I’m really glad I don’t have either one of th ose problems.

Francesca: You should be even happier you don’t hav e one of the more serious conditions such as fallen arches, a clubfoot, or ar thritis in your feet.

Walt: But I do have one problem. Let me take these shoes off and show you.

 Francesca: Pee-ew! I don’t even need to look at the m to know you have very bad foot odor.

Walt: What should I do?

Francesca: Get some new shoes, keep them dry, and c hange your socks every day.

Walt: Every day? You mean I have to own more than o ne pair?

[end of dialogue]

Walt asks Francesca, at the beginning of our dialog ue, “What are you doing?” Francesca says, “I’m selecting and organizing my ph otos for a presentation.” A “presentation” is when you give a little talk or sp eech to a group of people, giving them information about something. Often during a pr esentation, you will have something to show the audience – the people listeni ng to you.

In this case, Francesca is going to be showing them  some photos – some photographs, some pictures. Walt says, “Oh, can I s ee? All of these photos are of feet!” Your “feet,” of course, are what you walk on . Francesca says, “Well, I am a podiatrist and I’m giving a talk about foot conditi ons.” A “podiatrist” (podiatrist) is a foot doctor, a medical doctor who specializes in feet.

Walt says, “Ew, some of these are really disgusting .” Walt is looking at the photos and he thinks some of the photos are “disgus ting” (disgusting). Something that is “disgusting” makes you feel sick. Something  that is very unpleasant to look at might be described as “disgusting.” Walt begins actually by saying, “Ew,” which we would usually spell (ew). It’s a noise you  make to show that you are disgusted with something – that you find something very gross or unpleasant.

Francesca says, “You’re looking at some of the most  common foot conditions: blisters, corns, bunions, calluses, and athlete’s f oot.” Francesca explains that these photos Walt is looking at are of some very co mmon problems people have with their feet. The first problem is “blisters” (b listers).

A “blister” is a red-colored area of skin that is s ort of like a bubble. It is what we would call a “raised” area of skin. The bubble ofte n has a clear liquid in it that is caused usually by either heat – that is, if you bur n your skin you might get a blister – or by rubbing your skin against something . That may also cause a blister. Blisters are very common. Everyone gets bl isters. If you wear a pair of

shoes that are too tight, you might get blisters on  your feet because your skin is rubbing against the shoe.

“Corns” (corns) are small thick spots of dead skin,  especially on your feet. Once again, these are caused usually by pressure or rubb ing your feet against something. Many people have corns, little bits of d ead skin, on their feet. “Bunions” (bunions) are painful bumps that are foun d on your toe – your “big toe,” we would call it. Your hand has 10 fingers. Your fe et have 10 “toes” (toes). The biggest toe is the first one, and that is where you  would find a bunion. Bunions can be very painful.

“Calluses” (calluses) are large areas of hard, dead  skin that once again are often found on the bottom of your feet, although you coul d have calluses on your hands as well. If you work a lot with your hands, u se your hands a lot, you might eventually develop areas of hard, dead skin on your  hands. We would call those “calluses.” You could have calluses on your hands. You could have calluses on your feet.

Finally, there is a condition called “athlete’s foo t.” An “athlete” is someone who participates in sports or who does a lot of physica l activity such as running or swimming or playing football. All of those activiti es involve athletes – people who are physically fit. “Athlete’s foot,” however, is a ctually a kind of infection that grows on your feet. It’s what we would call a “fung al (fungal) infection,” often found between your toes or underneath your toenails .

Francesca, then, has photographs of all these diffe rent conditions. Walt then asks, “What is that?” He doesn’t understand one of the photos, or what is in one of the photos. Francesca explains, “That’s an ingro wn toenail and those are infected toenails.” A “toenail” (toenail) is the ha rd part at the end of your toes. You have fingernails at the end of your fingers.

Usually you have to cut or trim your fingernails be cause they grow and get too long. The same is true with your toenails. An “ingr own (ingrown) toenail” is a toenail that starts to grow into your foot and can be very painful. If something is “infected” (infected), it has some sort of bacteria  that causes it to be painful and perhaps turn red. “Infected” comes from the verb “t o infect” (infect) and is related to the noun “infection.” You can have an “infection ” in many different parts of your body, not just in your feet.

Walt says, “I’m really glad I don’t have either of those problems.” Francesca says, “You should be even happier you don’t have on e of the more serious conditions such as fallen arches, a clubfoot, or ar thritis in your feet.” Francesca

describes three other problems you could have with your feet. The first one is “fallen (fallen) arches (arches).”

The “arch” of your foot is that part between the fr ont and back of the foot on the side that goes up. It’s the part of your foot the d oesn’t touch the ground when you put your feet on the ground. If you have “fallen ar ches,” your arches do touch the ground and that can cause additional problems.

A “clubfoot” (clubfoot) is a condition that some pe ople are born with, in which one of the feet is twisted. It’s turned inward and prev ents the bottom of the foot from being placed flat on the ground. “Clubfoot” is a co ndition that nowadays is often corrected with surgery or other kinds of early trea tment with children.

“Arthritis” (arthritis) is something that can affec t your bones and different parts of your body. It is when the joints of your bone – whe re the bones connect together, where they come together – become swollen and often  painful. You can have arthritis in your feet. You could have arthritis in  your legs. You could have arthritis in your hands.

So, Francesca is describing these other, more serio us conditions that can affect one’s feet. Walt says, “But I do have one problem. Let me take these shoes off and show you.” So, Walt is taking his shoes off and  Francesca reacts to the smell that she notices. She say, “Pee-ew!” “Pee-ew” is a phrase that we use that means something smells very bad or unpleasant. She says, “I don’t even need to look at them” – meaning your feet – “to know you ha ve very bad foot odor.” “Odor” (odor) is smell, an unpleasant smell.

Walt says, “What should I do?” Francesca says, “Get  some new shoes, keep them dry,” meaning your shoes dry, “and change your  socks every day.” Doesn’t everyone change their socks every day? Walt says, “ Every day? You mean I have to own” – I have to have – “more than one pair ?” (more than one pair of socks). That is kind of weird, isn’t it, that Walt only has one pair of socks? I don’t think I’d want to be next to him when he took off h is shoes, either.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Walt: What are you doing?

Francesca: I’m selecting and organizing my photos f or a presentation.

Walt: Oh, can I see? All of these photos are of fee t!

Francesca: Well, I am a podiatrist and I’m giving a  talk about foot conditions.

Walt: Ew, some of these are really disgusting!

Francesca: You’re looking at some of the most commo n foot conditions: blisters, corns, bunions, calluses, and athlete’s foot.

Walt: What is that?

Francesca: That’s an ingrown toenail and those are infected toenails.

Walt: I’m really glad I don’t have either one of th ose problems.

Francesca: You should be even happier you don’t hav e one of the more serious conditions such as fallen arches, a clubfoot, or ar thritis in your feet.

Walt: But I do have one problem. Let me take these shoes off and show you.

This episode is a dialogue between Donald and Carla  about living on the fringes of society. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carla: Why do those teenagers have to dress like th at? Don’t they want to fit in?

Donald: Maybe they feel marginalized and they’re sh owing their feelings of alienation through their clothes.

Carla: That’s just a bunch of psychobabble. Nobody is treating them like second- class citizens. They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.

Donald: Maybe they don’t feel they have the same ac cess and privileges that other people do because of social class, religious beliefs, or other factors.

Carla: Nobody is shunning them. They choose to live  on the fringe of society. They need to stop making themselves conspicuous and  integrate into society.

Donald: What if they doubt they’d be accepted?

Carla: That’s ridiculous.

Donald: Would you want one of them as your neighbor ?

Carla: Well, I . . . well . . .

Donald: I think I’ve proved my point.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Living on the Fringes (frin ges) of Society.” The “fringes of society” refers to the people who are not accepted as normal members of the community, or who for a variety of reasons don’t fe el like they’re part of a country or a society – a group of people. Carla begins our dialogue by asking, “Why do those teenagers have to dress like that? Don’t they  want to fit in?” “To fit (fit) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be similar to the people around you, to be accepted by the people around you and feel comforta ble with others.

Donald says, “Maybe they feel marginalized and they ’re showing their feelings of alienation through their clothes,” or through their  clothing. “To be marginalized” (marginalized) is to be treated as though you were unimportant or not necessary for a given group. The verb “to marginalize” someon e means to treat them in a way that makes them feel unimportant. It’s a word m ostly used in politics and sociology more than in everyday conversation. “Alie nation” (alienation) is a feeling of not belonging or feeling part of a group .

Donald thinks that maybe these teenagers are dressi ng so differently from others because they don’t feel like they’re part of the gr oup. They have feelings of “alienation.” Notice that that word “alienation” ha s the word “alien” inside of it. “Alien” is what we might use to describe a person f rom another country, a foreigner. We might also describe a being from anot her planet, if such beings exist, as being “aliens.” E.T., from the movie of t he 1970s, was an alien. He was from another planet. My neighbor, I believe, is an alien. I think he’s from Mars. Yeah, seriously.

Anyway, Carla says to Donald, “That’s just a bunch of psychobabble.” “A bunch of” is an informal way of saying “a lot of.” “Psych obabble” (psychobabble) refers to terms or words that people use that come from ps ychology or psychotherapy, but that don’t really mean anything or that are not  used very accurately by non- psychologists. It’s what we might call a “derogator y term.” It’s an insulting term to describe the way someone is using language inaccura tely.

Carla says, “Nobody is treating them,” meaning thes e teenagers, “like second- class citizens.” “Second-class citizens” refers to people who are not perhaps respected or treated the way they should be. It mig ht also refer to a group of people who are discriminated against in a given soc iety or culture because of the way they look or because of who they are. But Carla  says these teenagers are not being treated like second-class citizens.

 She continues, “They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.” “To set yourself apart” means to do some thing or say something that makes you seem different from other people. “To mak e yourself an outcast” (outcast) is to make yourself so different from oth er people that other people don’t accept you, that other people reject you. An “outcast” is a person not accepted, or rejected, by people in a given communi ty or society.

Donald says, “Maybe they don’t feel they have the s ame access and privileges that other people do because of social class, relig ious beliefs, or other factors.” “Access” (access) is the ability to get something, is the ability to be able to obtain something. “Privilege” (privilege) refers to some a dvantage that you have over other people, often something that perhaps you don’ t earn but are given because of circumstances or situations that have nothing to  do with how smart you are or how hard you worked. That’s usually how the word is  used nowadays.

If someone talks about a person’s “privileges,” he’ s talking about things that person has that he didn’t have to work for, or perh aps didn’t have to earn. He got them just because of his parents or the place in wh ich he was born. Donald talks about social class and religious beliefs. “Social ( social) class” refers to the group of people you belong to based on how much money you  make.

In the United States, we sometimes talk about the “ upper class,” referring to rich people; the “middle class,” referring to people who  are neither rich nor poor; and the “lower class” or the “working class” – people w ho are usually poor. The term “social class” might refer not just perhaps to how much money you make, but also to the certain kinds of values or the certain kind of culture that people in your class or in your group might have.

“Religious beliefs” refer to the things that you be lieve in terms of God and the existence of a higher or supernatural being. People  around the world have different religious beliefs, and sometimes these re ligious beliefs may cause problems with those in the community who don’t share those beliefs. Carla says, however, “Nobody is shunning them.” “To shun” (shun ) someone is to reject or ignore someone. It might include even not talking t o the person or allowing the person into your house.

Carla continues, “They,” again referring to the tee nagers, “choose to live on the fringe of society.” We described what we mean by “t he fringes of society” earlier. “They need to stop making themselves conspicuous an d integrate into society.” “To be conspicuous” (conspicuous) is to be easily n oticed, to stand out, to be obvious. The teenagers, by dressing differently, are “conspicuous” – everyone

notices them. Carla says instead they should “integ rate (integrate) into society.” “To integrate” means to combine two things together  so that they become one unit or one group.

Donald says, “What if they doubt they’d be accepted ?” “To be accepted” means to be welcomed, to be appreciated as a member of a group. Carla says, “That’s ridiculous,” meaning that’s silly. Donald says, “Wo uld you want one of them as your neighbor?” In other words, he’s asking Carla i f she would accept one of these teenagers living next door to her, being her neighbor.

Carla doesn’t answer right away. She says, “Well, I  . . . well . . .” You can tell the answer is no. Donald then says, “I think I’ve prove d my point.” “To prove (prove) your point (point)” is to demonstrate that what you  just said is true, that what you just said is correct. “To prove your point” is to p rovide evidence that shows that what you are saying is true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carla: Why do those teenagers have to dress like th at? Don’t they want to fit in?

Donald: Maybe they feel marginalized and they’re sh owing their feelings of alienation through their clothes.

Carla: That’s just a bunch of psychobabble. Nobody is treating them like second- class citizens. They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.

Donald: Maybe they don’t feel they have the same ac cess and privileges that other people do because of social class, religious beliefs, or other factors.

Carla: Nobody is shunning them. They choose to live  on the fringe of society. They need to stop making themselves conspicuous and  integrate into society.

Donald: What if they doubt they’d be accepted?

Carla: That’s ridiculous.

Donald: Would you want one of them as your neighbor ?

Carla: Well, I . . . well . . .

 Donald: I think I’ve proved my point.

# Using a Property Management Company

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,192 – Using a Property Management Company.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,192. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. If you don’t, I’m going to sing the rest of this episode. So go there now. When you do, you can beco me a member of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this ep isode.

This episode is a dialogue about using a company to  help you run a property. Now, you might not own any property, but you will l earn some interesting vocabulary in this episode related to businesses an d renting. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: Hello, Fickle Property Management Company.

Frank: Hello, I own an office building on Broadway Boulevard and I’m interested in hiring a property management company.

Sonia: You’ve called the right place. We help you a dvertise your vacant units, show empty properties, and screen prospective tenan ts.

Frank: The building is partially occupied right now  and I want to be sure that any new tenants are financially sound.

Sonia: That’s why we require a rental application w ith financial details and check their credit history. We are very thorough.

Frank: Will you also draw up the rental agreement?

Sonia: Yes, we handle all of the rental details, in cluding the deposit and delivery of keys.

Frank: What if tenants have problems?

Sonia: We are on call 24/7 and will send out someon e from our maintenance department to deal with any problems.

 Frank: This sounds like what I’m looking for. What is your fee structure?

Sonia: Oh, our services are very reasonable.

Frank: When can you start?

Sonia: As soon as you sign an agreement with us.

Frank: Great. Can you email the agreement to me rig ht now? The building has some stopped-up toilets that need attention ASAP!

[end of dialogue]

Sonia says to Frank, “Hello, Fickle Property Manage ment Company.” She’s answering the phone, of course. The word “property”  (property) can refer to a piece of land or a piece of land that has a buildin g on it. A “property management company” is a company, a business, that takes care of buildings such as apartment buildings and office buildings.

A property management company would be responsible for getting the rent from the people who are in the building. It would be res ponsible for fixing any problems in the building. In the United States, if you rent an apartment in a large apartment building, it’s likely that the building i s run not by the people who own the building, but by another company – a property m anagement company.

Sonia works for the Fickle Property Management Comp any. This is sort of a joke. The word “fickle” (fickle) describes a person who c hanges his mind a lot, or who isn’t very loyal to one person or to an organizatio n. We might describe a fan, someone who likes a particular sports team, as bein g “fickle” if he only likes the team when the team wins. He doesn’t like the team w hen it loses. That would be a “fickle fan” – someone who changes their mind dep ending on the situation.

Frank says, “Hello, I own an office building on Bro adway Boulevard and I’m interested in hiring a property management company. ” The word “hire” here refers to signing a contract to have a business wor k for you. Sonia says, “You’ve called the right place. We help you advertise your vacant units, show empty properties, and screen prospective tenants.”

Sonia lists some of the things that a property mana gement company might do. This includes “advertising your vacant (vacant) uni ts.” The word “vacant” means empty, and is used to describe a building or a spac e within a building that is not

being rented, not being used. If you say, “We have a vacant house,” you mean you have a house that isn’t occupied, in which no o ne is living. It’s empty.

Sonia says her company will “advertise” – will let people know about – “vacant units.” The word “unit” (unit) here refers to a spa ce in a building. Sonia says her property management company, or the one she works f or, will “advertise vacant units” in a building. It will also “show (show) emp ty properties.” “To show” means to let people look at, to give people a tour of. “E mpty properties” refers to buildings or units within buildings that are empty.

Sonia also says her company will “screen prospectiv e tenants.” A “tenant” (tenant) is a person who rents either a space in a building, or an apartment in an apartment complex or apartment building. We would c all the person who is renting a “tenant.” So, if you rent your apartment,  you are a tenant. A “prospective (prospective) tenant” is someone who i s thinking about renting but hasn’t rented yet. A prospective tenant would be so meone who would come and look at, say, an apartment that you are renting, an d be interested in renting it but has not yet rented it.

“To screen” (screen) someone means to determine if this person is qualified – if this person is someone to whom you would want to re nt a unit, in this case. We use this verb “to screen” in a lot of different cir cumstances. For example, a business might “screen applications” or “screen app licants” – people who want to get a job. The company will look through all the di fferent applications and decide which people it wants to interview. That’s part of the “screening process,” we might say.

Frank says that his building is “partially occupied  right now.” “To be occupied” means that there are people there in the building, renting in the building or renting spaces in the building. “To be partially (p artially) occupied” means that there are some spaces or units that are rented and some that are empty. “Partially” means not completely. You may ask someo ne if he is finished with his project, and the person may respond, “I am partiall y finished.” That means I haven’t completely finished it. I’m 50 percent or 7 5 percent finished.

Frank says he wants to make sure that “any new tena nts are financially sound.” “To be financially sound” (sound) means to have eno ugh money to, in this case, pay your rent every month. Sonia says, “That’s why we require a rental application with financial details and check their credit history.” A “rental (rental) application” is a piece of paper that you put infor mation on about who you are and how much money you have and what kind of busine ss you want to run in the rented unit.

 “Financial details” would refer to your bank accoun ts or how much money you have, what kind of business you have, and how much money the business is worth. Your “credit (credit) history” is a list of all of the loans and debt that you have. “Debt” (debt) – notice we don’t pronounce the  “b” – is money you owe other people. So if you have a credit card, you hav e “credit card debt.” You have money that you owe the credit card company. Your “c redit history” would list all of your credit cards, for example, in addition to any other loans you have.

Frank says, “Will you also draw up a rental agreeme nt?” The phrasal verb “to draw (draw) up” means to write or create a document . Usually we use this phrasal verb when we’re talking about a legal docum ent such as a contract. You may talk about “drawing up a contract” to rent a pr operty. That contract is usually called a “rental agreement.” The word “agreement” i s another word for a contract.

Sonia says, “Yes, we handle,” meaning we take care of, “all of the rental details, including the deposit and delivery of keys.” A “dep osit” (deposit), sometimes called a “security deposit,” is money that you pay before you rent a home or an apartment or a unit in a commercial building that i s kept by the owner in case you do any damage to the building or the apartment.

A “deposit” is money that will be given back to you  when you are no longer renting the apartment or the building or the unit. So, in the United States, for example, if you want to rent an apartment, you usua lly have to give the person or the company you are renting from your first month’s  rent, your last month’s rent, and a security deposit. Some apartments will just r equire the first month’s rent and a security deposit.

How much is the security deposit? Often it’s the sa me as the amount you pay for one month’s worth of rent. So, if you’re renting a unit for a thousand dollars a month, your security deposit will probably be aroun d a thousand dollars. That’s money that the property management company or the p erson who is renting you the property will keep until you leave the apartmen t or leave the unit. Then, if you haven’t damaged anything inside of the unit, you wi ll get that money back.

However, if you did cause any damage, the owner or management company will use that deposit to fix whatever damage you did. In  fact, sometimes it’s called a “damage deposit.” The word “damage” (damage) means physical harm that you cause something, such as a hole in the wall or some  sort of paint on the floor that shouldn’t be there. Sonia says her property managem ent company takes care of the deposit and the “delivery of keys,” meaning the  company will give whoever is

renting the apartment the keys to the apartment or the unit. In this case, it’s an office inside of an office building.

Frank asks, “What if tenants have problems?” Sonia says, “We are on call 24/7.” “To be on call” means to be available. “24/7” means  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In other words, all the time. Sonia says that  they will send out someone from their “maintenance department to deal with,” o r take care of, “any problems.” “Maintenance” (maintenance) refers to ta king care of something so that it keeps working or fixing something if it’s b roken.

Frank says, “That sounds like what I’m looking for.  What is your fee structure?” Your “fee” (fee) is the amount of money you pay som eone, in this case, to do something. “Fee structure” (structure) refers to a list or a chart of all the different prices that you will have to pay depending on the d ifferent services or things you are asking the company to do for you. Sonia says, “ Oh, our services are very reasonable,” meaning they don’t cost very much.

Frank says, “When can you start?” Sonia says, “As s oon as you sign an agreement with us.” Frank says, “Great. Can you ema il the agreement to me right now? The building has some stopped-up toilets  that need attention ASAP!” Frank is saying that the building that he owns has some “stopped-up toilets” (toilets). A “toilet” is, of course, a place in a b athroom that you use to do what you must do in a bathroom. I think you understand what I mean, and I don’t mean showering.

If a toilet is “stopped-up,” it isn’t flushing prop erly. The water isn’t going down through the pipes properly. It “isn’t working prope rly,” we might say. “ASAP” means “as soon as possible.” Frank, in other words,  has a problem in the building that he owns, and he wants to get a proper ty management company to go and take care of it right away – ASAP.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: Hello, Fickle Property Management Company.

Frank: Hello, I own an office building on Broadway Boulevard and I’m interested in hiring a property management company.

Sonia: You’ve called the right place. We help you a dvertise your vacant units, show empty properties, and screen prospective tenan ts.

# Reducing Food Waste

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,193 – Reducing Food Waste.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,193. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Yeah.

This episode is a dialogue between Jon and Marta ab out not wasting your food. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jon: Wait! What are doing with that squishy tomato?

Marta: I’m tossing it. It’s no good anymore.

Jon: I’ll take it, and I’ll take that stale bread, too.

Marta: Stop! You can’t fish that out of the trash.

Jon: I’m trying to do my part to reduce food waste.  Tired vegetables are still okay to eat, as are bruised fruit.

Marta: Fine, but not once they’ve been discarded. S tay out of my trash.

Jon: What you are going to do with this graying mea t?

Marta: I was going to throw that out, too.

Jon: I’ll take it. I’m sure I can make something ed ible with it.

Marta: You can’t be serious. I’m all for doing my p art, but I draw the line at eating spoiled meat.

Jon: It’s not spoiled. It’s just beyond the peak of  freshness.

 Marta: Well, be my guest. You can have all of this food.

Jon: And to show my thanks, I’ll invite you over to  lunch tomorrow.

Marta: Thanks, but no thanks.

[end of dialogue]

Jon says to Marta, “Wait! What are you doing with t hat squishy tomato?” “Squishy” (squishy) is something that is soft, usua lly something that you can change the shape of easily by squeezing it or putti ng your hands around it. A “squishy tomato” would be a tomato that is no longe r hard or “firm” (firm), meaning when you pick it up, it would fall apart. B asically, Jon is asking Marta what she is doing with a tomato that seems to be sq uishy.

Marta says, “I’m tossing it. It’s no good anymore.”  “To toss” (toss) here means to throw away, to get rid of. Jon says, “I’ll take it,  and I’ll take that stale bread, too.” Jon wants Marta to give him this squishy tomato as well as some “stale (stale) bread.” Bread that is “stale” is no longer fresh. I t’s old and dried out. Often, it’s hard. Marta says, “Stop! You can’t fish that out of  the trash.” “To fish” (fish) something out of something else means to take somet hing out of a container where it is surrounded by other things.

So for example, if you open up a drawer that has lo ts of different things in it, you may “fish out” something. You may take something ou t that is mixed up with or in a pile of other things. In this case, Jon is trying  to fish something “out of the trash” (trash). “Trash” here refers to garbage or things t hat are being thrown away. Most people in their houses have a container, an object that they use to put trash into or to put garbage into – things that they are throw ing away, things that they are getting rid of.

Well, Jon is apparently trying to take some food ou t of a trash container, which sounds pretty awful, pretty disgusting. Jon says, h owever, that he’s trying to do his part to “reduce food waste.” “Food waste” (wast e) is food that is not eaten but instead thrown away when in fact it could still be used. Jon says that he’s trying “to reduce food waste.” He’s trying to make sure th at we don’t waste too much food. He says, “Tired vegetables are still okay to eat, as are bruised fruit.”

“Tired” (tired) usually means the same as sleepy – of not having a lot of energy. But “tired vegetables” would refer to older vegetab les that start to look like they aren’t very fresh, that you may not want to eat the m. But Jon says it’s okay to eat

tired vegetables – vegetables that are older. He al so says it’s okay to eat “bruised (bruised) fruit.” If fruit is “bruised,” it has small dark spots on the skin and is usually soft in those particular spots, those ar eas. If you have a banana that’s bruised, it will often be black because of the brui se, and it will be soft when you touch it.

Jon says it’s okay to eat bruised fruit. Marta says , “Fine, but not once they’ve been discarded.” She’s saying maybe it’s okay to ea t tired vegetables and bruised fruit, but not once they have been “discard ed” (discarded). “To discard” means to throw something away – to put something, i n this case, in the garbage container. She then tells Jon, “Stay out of my tras h,” meaning don’t go looking in my trash container and taking things out of it. “To  stay out of” someplace means not to go there or not to go in there.

Jon then asks her, “What are you going to do with t his graying meat?” “Graying” (graying) comes from the color “gray” (gray). Meat can turn gray when it gets old, and it’s usually a sign you don’t want to eat it. T hat’s why Marta says, “I was going to throw that out, too.” She was going to get  rid of the graying meat. But Jon says, “I’ll take it. I’m sure I can make someth ing edible with it.” “Edible” (edible) means able to be eaten, something you can eat without getting sick.

Jon thinks he can take this graying meat, this old meat, and make something out of it, cook something that would allow him to eat it. I’m not so sure. Neither is Marta. She says, “You can’t be serious,” meaning yo u must be joking. “I’m all for,” meaning I’m in favor of, “doing my part.” “To  do your part” means to help in a group effort or to do your fair share of the work.

If someone says, “I want to do my part,” that perso n wants to help the group do something. Not everything, but what that person thi nks would be his responsibility or his part of the work that needs t o be done. Marta wants to do her part to stop wasting food. But she says, “I draw the line at eating spoiled meat.” The expression “to draw (draw) the line” means to i ndicate that you will not do anything beyond a certain point. You are indicating  the limits of something. You are saying how much you will accept and what you wo n’t accept.

Notice she says, “I will draw the line at,” and the n she says, “eating spoiled meat.” What she’s saying here is that she’s not going to eat spoil meat. That’s the limit to what she will do in terms of stopping food waste. She won’t do that. She’s drawing the line at this particular action – eating “spoiled” (spoiled) meat. “Spoiled food” is food that you can no longer eat, usually because it is too old and has become what we would describe as “rotten” ( rotten). If food is “rotten,” it will make you sick if you eat it.

 Sometimes we use that adjective “rotten” when we’re  talking about a person who misbehaves, or who does things wrong or acts badly.  You may talk about a “rotten child” – a child who is always screaming an d causing problems and not being very nice. There was a famous punk rock star of the 1970s called Johnny Rotten. Well, here we’re not talking about rock sta rs. We’re talking about food that you should not eat, and Marta doesn’t want to eat food that is spoiled or rotten.

Jon (no relation, I think, to Johnny Rotten – meani ng I don’t think the two are brothers or anything) says, “It’s not spoiled. It’s  just beyond the peak of freshness.” “To be beyond (beyond)” means to be pas t something. The “peak” (peak) of something is the highest point. You can t hink of a mountain having a “peak.” It’s the highest point, the highest place o n a mountain. “Freshness” (freshness) is when food is at its best, when it is  best to eat. If something is “beyond the peak of freshness,” then, it is no long er the best time to eat it, but it’s still okay to eat it. That’s what Jon is saying.

Marta says, “Well, be my guest.” This is a very com mon expression in conversational English. “Be my guest” means go ahea d and do it. You are telling someone it’s okay for him to do something. Sometime s, however – often, in fact – we use it somewhat as a joke or use it “sarcastic ally,” meaning we don’t really mean it or we are saying that we don’t want to do s omething, but if you want to, then you can do it.

For example, let’s say your neighbor’s dog is barki ng. And you start yelling at the dog, and the dog, of course, being stupid as dogs a re, doesn’t do anything. And your wife says to you, “Why don’t you tell that dog  to be quiet?” And you say, “I’ve already tried.” She says, “Well, I’m going to  try.” And you say, “Okay, be my guest.” You’re telling her to go and try to get the  dog to be quiet, but you’re probably saying it in such a way as to indicate tha t you don’t think she will be very successful.

One thing you might try to do is to give the dog so me spoiled meat. That might eventually cause the dog to no longer bark. Just ki dding, of course. You shouldn’t do that. I am not recommending that to anyone. Plea se don’t email and tell me that I’m a rotten person. Anyway, Marta says, “Well , be my guest.” “You can have all of this food,” she says. Jon says, “And to show  my thanks” – to thank you – “I’ll invite you over to lunch tomorrow.” Jon is in viting Marta to come over to his house and have lunch. Marta says, “Thanks, but nothanks.”

If someone asks you to do something that you think is dangerous or perhaps is going to be unpleasant, and you want to indicate th at the person probably shouldn’t have even asked you to do this, you might  use this expression, “Thanks, but no thanks.” It means no, I really don’ t want to do that. You’re thanking the person, but you’re saying “no thanks,”  meaning no, I don’t want to.

Of course, Marta doesn’t want to go over to Jon’s h ouse and eat all of the food that Jon has taken from her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jon: Wait! What are doing with that squishy tomato?

Marta: I’m tossing it. It’s no good anymore.

Jon: I’ll take it, and I’ll take that stale bread, too.

Marta: Stop! You can’t fish that out of the trash.

Jon: I’m trying to do my part to reduce food waste.  Tired vegetables are still okay to eat, as are bruised fruit.

Marta: Fine, but not once they’ve been discarded. S tay out of my trash.

Jon: What you are going to do with this graying mea t?

Marta: I was going to throw that out, too.

Jon: I’ll take it. I’m sure I can make something ed ible with it.

Marta: You can’t be serious. I’m all for doing my p art, but I draw the line at eating spoiled meat.

Jon: It’s not spoiled. It’s just beyond the peak of  freshness.

Marta: Well, be my guest. You can have all of this food.

Jon: And to show my thanks, I’ll invite you over to  lunch tomorrow.

Marta: Thanks, but no thanks.

 [end of dialogue]

There’s nothing stale, bruised, or graying about ou r dialogues. They’re all at the peak of freshness thanks to our wonderful scriptwri ter, Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Using a Map Program

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,194 – Using a Map Program.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,194. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com to become a member of ESL Podcast and download the PDF Learning Guide for this episode. You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store with additional courses in Business and Daily  English.

This dialogue is about using a software program – a n application on a computer or a phone – related to a map. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Caroline: I just got an email from Sandra with her new address. I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is living in .

Bryce: Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map program.

Caroline: That will just tell us where she’s living  within the city, not what kind of neighborhood it is.

Bryce: Just wait. I can show you the street view of  her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.

Caroline: Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the buil ding look a little run-down?

Bryce: That’s what you get with high-resolution ima ges. You see every detail. You can navigate around and see a panoramic view of  her street.

Caroline: Oh, that doesn’t look very clean or safe.

Bryce: Let me show you an aerial view. The satellit e view will give you a better idea of the entire area.

Caroline: Is that an airport nearby and are those f actories? What will this other view show us?

Bryce: That provides real-time traffic information and allows for route planning. It looks like she lives on a highly congested street. Hey, where are you going?

Caroline: I’m going to visit our daughter. I want t o see for myself what kind of hovel she’s living in!

[end of dialogue]

Caroline begins our dialogue by saying, “I just got  an email from Sandra with her new address.” Your “address” (address) is informati on that allows someone to find you. Usually an “address” will have the name of the stre et on which you live, the number of your house or apartment building, the cit y where you live – here in the United States, the state in which you live – and so mething called a “zip (zip) code (code).” In some countries, it’s called a “postal c ode.” It’s a number that is assigned to the general area or neighborhood in whi ch you live. In some countries, the postal code is a combination of lett ers and numbers. In the United States, it’s just numbers. There are five digits in  a standard zip code.

So, Caroline has the address of Sandra, and we lear n that Sandra is her daughter – or I guess Carolyn and Bryce’s daughter – because she says, “I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is li ving in.” Bryce says, “Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map prog ram.” “To type (type) in” means to use what we call a “keyboard” (keyboard) to ente r information into a computer. A keyboard has the letters and numbers that you wou ld use to enter information into your computer. I say “letters,” of course, ref erring here to the English alphabet.

A “map program” would be any sort of application or  software program that would have a map associated with it and allow you to find  people on the map. On my phone, for example, I have a couple of different ma p “apps” or applications, including Google and Apple. Caroline says, “That wi ll just tell us where she’s living within the city, not what kind of neighborho od it is.” A “neighborhood” is in area of a city. Everyone lives in a neighborhood – an area or section of the city. Caroline is interested in finding out the kind of n eighborhood her daughter is living in – not just where it is, but is it a good neighborhood, is it a bad neighborhood, what kind of people live there, and s o forth.

Bryce says, “Just wait. I can show you the street v iew of her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.” On some map programs, including Google Maps, in many cities you can actually look at photo graphs of the different parts of the city – the buildings and houses in the city. Th at’s what “street view” allows

you to do. It’s an image of, or a photograph of, the street and the buildings on that street. It’s almost as if you were walking dow n the street. This is an amazing thing you can do. Some people don’t like the idea o f, say, Google going around and taking photographs of everyone’s house, but it can be convenient if you want to see what a house or building looks like.

Bryce says that is what he can do so that he and hi s wife, Caroline, can look at their daughter Sandra’s apartment. Caroline says, “ Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the building look a little run-down?” The t erm “run-down” means that it is not in very good condition, perhaps because it is old or has been used a lot. If we describe a building as being “run-down,” we’re sayi ng the building is old and perhaps even falling apart. Maybe some of the walls  aren’t painted and the ceilings – the top of the room – perhaps has holes in it. That would be a run- down building, or what we would describe as a “run- down building.”

You could describe yourself as being “run-down” if you’ve been working a lot recently, or perhaps have some sort of cold or flu.  You may “feel run-down,” like you are falling apart. The phrasal verb “to fall ap art,” usually refers to an object whose pieces are beginning to come apart. In other words, the object is breaking apart into smaller pieces. Caroline thinks the buil ding her daughter Sandra lives in looks a little run-down. Her husband, Bryce, say s, “That’s what you get with high-resolution images.” “High-resolution images” a re images that are very high quality. They allow you to see the small details of  an image.

In fact, that’s what Bryce says next. He says, “You  can see every detail” (detail). “Details” are small specific pieces of information about something. A detail on a photograph could be a small part of the image. “Det ails,” in general, refer to specific pieces of information. You could have deta ils about almost anything. I could give you the details of a story, the specific  things that happened in a story, or you could give someone the details of the meetin g you went to – all the things that happened in the meeting, the specific pieces of information.

Bryce says, “You can navigate around and see a pano ramic view of her street.” “To navigate” (navigate) means to move around or mo ve through something, especially if it is difficult. Here it refers to the ability to see different parts of the city or the, in this case, “street view.” You can –  on for example the Google map program, when it is available – actually move down the street and see the different houses along the street. In this case, the map program allows Bryce to see a “panoramic (panoramic) view” of her street. “ Panoramic” refers to a large, wide view of something.

Caroline says, “Oh, that doesn’t look very clean or  safe.” She’s referring to the area where her daughter lives – perhaps the streets  are dirty or the other buildings around her apartment are run-down as well . Bryce says, “Let me show you an aerial view.” “Aerial” (aerial) means from t he air. Again, many map programs will show you a satellite photo of an area , as if you were up in the sky looking down at it. Bryce mentions this in his next  sentence. He says, “The satellite (satellite) view will give you a better i dea of an entire area.” A “satellite” is a piece of equipment that goes around the earth, wa y up in space. It “orbits,” or goes around the earth, and some satellites can take  photographs of the earth.

Caroline says, “Is that an airport nearby and are t hose factories?” Caroline is now looking at the satellite or aerial photographs of t he neighborhood in which her daughter lives. She’s asking if there is an airport  nearby. She sees an airport on the photograph and she also sees some “factories” ( factories). A “factory” is a large building where things are “manufactured” – wh ere they’re made, where they’re produced. Normally you don’t find factories  next to nice or good neighborhoods because factories can be noisy or the y can have a lot of pollution associated with them. So, Caroline is concerned abo ut the quality of this neighborhood if it’s right near an airport and has factories in it.

Then she says, “What will this other view show us?”  She’s looking at the map program, probably pointing to some other feature on  the program. Bryce says, “That provides real-time traffic information and al lows for route planning.” On some map applications, you can find out what the tr affic is like – how many cars are on the street or freeway. “Real-time” means rig ht now – or more typically, within the last, say, five minutes. “Route” (route)  refers to how you go from one place to another. “Route planning” would allow you to figure out which streets or freeways you should take to get from one part of the city to another.

Bryce says, “It looks like she lives on a highly co ngested street.” If a street is “congested” (congested), there are a lot of cars on  it, a lot of traffic. It’s a very, what we would describe as, “busy” (busy) street. A “busy street” is a street that has a lot of cars going back and forth on it. Again , that is probably not the best place to live since it could be very noisy.

Bryce then asks Caroline, “Hey, where are you going ?” Caroline says, “I’m going to visit our daughter. I want to see for myself wha t kind of hovel she’s living in.” Caroline is going to, I guess, drive over to her da ughter’s house to see it for herself. She is worried that her daughter is living  in a “hovel” (hovel). A “hovel” is a small, old, dirty building. Usually it’s a very n egative way to describe someone’s house. Sandra, the daughter, lives in an apartment,  but we use the term “hovel” in general to describe a small, not very nice place  to live.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Caroline: I just got an email from Sandra with her new address. I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is living in .

Bryce: Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map program.

Caroline: That will just tell us where she’s living  within the city, not what kind of neighborhood it is.

Bryce: Just wait. I can show you the street view of  her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.

Caroline: Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the buil ding look a little run-down?

# Types of Allergies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,195 – Types of Allergies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,195. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guide contains a complete transcript of ev erything we say.

This episode is a dialogue about types of allergies  – a medical condition that you don’t want to have. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bert: Doctor, give it to me straight. Is my medical  condition serious?

Doctor: I suspect that your rashes and other sympto ms are the result of allergies.

Bert: Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of seri ous disease.

Doctor: Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give  you tests to see what you’re allergic to.

Bert: You mean I might have allergies to more than one thing?

Doctor: There are many kinds of allergies. Some peo ple have food allergies and have adverse reactions when they ingest or even com e near some types of food.

Bert: That sounds terrible. I hope I don’t have foo d allergies. I would have to restrict my diet.

Doctor: Other people have seasonal allergies to pol len from trees, grasses, and weeds.

Bert: That would mean I couldn’t do some types of o utdoor activities.

Doctor: Many people are allergic to pets, most comm only cat or dog dander.

Bert: Oh no, I’d have to get rid of my three cats o r dog!

 Doctor: You might also be allergic to dust mites, i nsect bites, or even mold spores in your home.

Bert: You mean I might have to move out of my house ?

Doctor: If mold is detected in your home, you might  need to move out temporarily while the mold is removed.

Bert: Are you sure I don’t have some kind of diseas e? I think I’d prefer that to allergies!

[end of dialogue]

Bert begins by saying to his doctor, “Doctor, give it to me straight.” The expression “Give it to me straight” (straight) mean s tell me directly without trying to make something sound better than it is, without hesitating. Usually we use this expression when you think the person is going to te ll you something bad or is going to give you bad news, especially bad news abo ut you – in this case, about your health.

So when Bert says, “Give it to me straight,” he mea ns tell me whatever the bad news is right away. Don’t try to make me feel good about it or change it in some way to make it seem less serious than it really is.  He then asks, “Is my medical condition serious?” Your “medical condition” is som ething that is causing you to be in poor health, something that is making you sic k or ill. The doctor says, “I suspect that your rashes and other symptoms are the  result of allergies.”

A “rash” (rash) is a red, bumpy area on your skin t hat is often itchy – one that causes you to want to take your fingers and move your fingers over that area of your skin. We would use the verb “to scratch” (scra tch). “To scratch your skin” is to take your fingers, the end of your fingers – you r “fingernails,” specifically – and move them back and forth over an area of your skin.

Bert has rashes on his skin. The doctor thinks thes e are a result of “allergies” (allergies). An “allergy” is a condition that cause s you to react badly when you are in the presence of some substance. For example,  if you have an allergy to, say, “dust” – small little pieces of dirt – you mig ht sneeze or your eyes might begin to water. If you have an allergy to a certain  kind of food, you may have difficulty breathing after you eat that food, or yo u might get rashes on your skin.

People have allergies to all sorts of substances. S ome people have allergies to peanuts or other kinds of food. Some people have al lergies to cats and dogs and other animals. The adjective that comes from allerg y is “allergic” (allergic). Someone may say, “I am allergic to cats” – that mea ns that person has an allergy to cats – or “I am allergic to my mother-in-law.” W henever my mother-in-law is here, I start to feel sick.

Bert says, “Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of serious disease.” A “disease” (disease) is an illness – something that makes you sick. Clearly, Bert doesn’t think that having an allergy to something is very s erious. But the doctor says, “Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give you te sts to see what you’re allergic to.” Notice again that expression, “allergic to.”

Bert says, “You mean I might have allergies to more  than one thing?” The doctor says, “There are many kinds of allergies. Some peop le have food allergies and have adverse reactions when they ingest or even com e near some types of food.” A “food allergy” is obviously an allergy tha t causes you to have a bad reaction – an “adverse reaction” – to certain kinds  of food. “Adverse” (adverse) means the same here as bad or harmful.

When some people eat shrimp or other kinds of shell fish, they may have difficulty breathing or they may get rashes on their skin. I h ave an allergy to seafood, to shrimp in particular, and if I eat shrimp, I get re d patches on my skin – rashes. The verb “to ingest” (ingest) means to eat or drink  something.

Bert says, “That sounds terrible. I hope I don’t ha ve food allergies. I would have to restrict my diet.” “To restrict (restrict) your diet (diet)” means to avoid certain kinds of food or to limit how much food you eat, es pecially in response to some sort of medical condition. If you are gaining too m uch weight and that is causing physical or health problems, you may have to restri ct your diet – avoid, say, bread and pasta and candies and cookies, or change how much you eat at every meal.

The doctor says, “Other people have seasonal allerg ies to pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds.” “Seasonal” (seasonal) refers t o the four seasons of the year – winter, spring, summer, and fall. “Seasonal allergies” are allergies that bother you only during certain times of the year. T hese are often related to “pollen” (pollen). Pollen is a small substance – a “powder,” we would call it – that is produced within the flower of a plant.

Pollen is part of a plant’s reproductive cycle. It’ s how the plant spreads, how you get new plants from that same plant. Well, pollen, when you breathe it in, can

cause problems for some people if you have an aller gy to that pollen. Pollen can come from trees. It can come from “grasses” – thing s that grow out of the ground that are tall and thin, or it can come from “weeds”  (weeds).

The word “weed” refers to a plant that you don’t wa nt. It isn’t so much a scientific classification as it is one that we use to refer to  certain kinds of plants that we don’t want versus the ones that we do. Weeds are al most always what we would call “wild (wild) plants.” They’re not plants that you put there. They are plants that are just in the area where you live and happen to g row up on your property or where you have other plants growing. We refer to th ese in the plural as “weeds.” One of them would be “a weed.”

Don’t confuse this with another kind of plant, whic h is “weed” without the article, definite or indefinite, in front of it. If you talk  about “weed” without saying “a weed” or “the weeds” or “weeds,” plural, you’re referring  to “marijuana.” It’s an informal term for marijuana. Someone says, “You want to smok e some weed?” That person is asking you if you want to smoke some mari juana. And if it’s not legal to, you should probably say no. But “weeds,” plural, or  “a weed” or “the weed” refers to a wild plant.

Bert says, “That would mean I couldn’t do some type s of outdoor activities” – that is, if you were allergic to certain kinds of pollen . The doctor says, “Many people are allergic to pets, most commonly cat or dog dand er.” “Dander” (dander) are small pieces of skin that come off of the skin of a  cat or dog. Bert says, “Oh no, I’d have to get rid of my three cats or dog!” Bert apparently has three cats and a dog. If he’s allergic to cats or dogs, he may have to get rid of the cats or dogs. Let’s hope it’s the cats.

The doctor says, “You might also be allergic to dus t mites, insect bites, or even mold spores in your home.” The doctor lists three o ther things that people are commonly allergic to. The first is “dust (dust) mit es (mites).” “Dust” is small pieces of dirt. A “mite” (mite) is a small little b ug that can live in your house, and some people are allergic to those bugs. An “insect”  (insect) is a small bug that often has wings on it. An “insect bite” (bite) is w hen that insect lands on your skin and tries to get into your skin. It bites your skin .

“Mold” (mold) here refers to a kind of fungus. Mold  can grow on cheese, for example. Mold can grow on the outside of a tree. Mold usually requires a warm, wet area. A “mold spore” (spore) is similar to poll en from a tree. It’s the part of a mold organism that can be used to spread to other a reas and produce more mold. Again, some people have an allergy to mold or  mold spores, and that can cause a problem. Bert says, “You mean I might have to move out of my house?”

Mold is sometimes found in people’s houses, especia lly in warm, damp areas such as a bathroom.

The doctor says, “If mold is detected in your home,  you might need to move out temporarily while the mold is removed.” “Detected” (detected) comes from the verb “to detect” (detect), which means “to find.” S o, if mold is “detected” in your home, mold has been found in your home. It’s presen t in your house. You need to remove the mold, and that sometimes requires you  to leave your house “temporarily,” for a short time, while they come in  and get rid of the mold.

Bert says, “Are you sure I don’t have some other ki nd of disease? I think I’d prefer that to allergies!” Bert is saying that he w ould prefer to have another kind of disease other than allergies.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bert: Doctor, give it to me straight. Is my medical  condition serious?

Doctor: I suspect that your rashes and other sympto ms are the result of allergies.

Bert: Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of seri ous disease.

Doctor: Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give  you tests to see what you’re allergic to.

# Checking Facts and Figures

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,196 – Checking Facts and Figures.

We also have additional courses in Business English and Daily En glish that I think you will enjoy. And like us on Facebook, if you haven’t alre ady. Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

This dialogue is about making sure you have your fa cts correct, as well as numbers, that are part of your report or whatever it is you are working on. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Takagi: Before we disseminate this report, I need y ou to fact-check it. I don’t want a repeat of what happened last year.

Ellie: What happened last year? I wasn’t working he re then.

Takagi: Last year’s report had a lot of small inacc uracies and a few major errors. We ended up having to issue a second version of the  report.

Ellie: Okay, but I thought it had already been sign ed off on by the department heads.

Takagi: It has, but those are the same department h eads who skimmed the report last year and didn’t catch all those problem s. I want you to go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

Ellie: What should I check?

Takagi: Everything. I want you to verify the facts and figures and to flag anything that is outright wrong or even a little suspect.

Ellie: Okay, I’ll do that, but this will take some time.

 Takagi: What are you doing this weekend?

Ellie: Nothing, now.

[end of dialogue]

Takagi begins our dialogue by saying to Ellie, “Bef ore we disseminate this report, I need you to fact-check it. I don’t want a repeat of what happened last year.” “To disseminate” (disseminate) means to distribute, to give to a number of different people, to share information or copies of something  with many different people. It’s a word you will hear sometimes in business Eng lish. It basically just means to give to a number of different people a piece of inf ormation, or in this case a report – a written document that describes or expla ins something.

“To fact-check” (fact-check) means to look at the s pecific information in a report, the details of something, to make sure that everyth ing is correct, that everything is accurate, that all of the information you are gi ving is true. The verb “to fact- check” has become popular in recent years, especial ly in some American newspapers and websites that report on politics. Wh en a politician says something, when someone involved in public life or policy says something, the newspapers or websites will try to make sure that w hat the person said is correct. They will “fact-check” it.

Unfortunately, most newspapers and websites have th eir own political biases, so to fact-check for them usually means to see if it a grees with their own political views, and if it doesn’t, they’ll find some reason to say that it was wrong. I don’t really rely very much on newspapers and websites th at “fact-check” what politicians say. I don’t normally think they are te lling the complete truth, but maybe that’s just me.

Takagi isn’t talking about politics. He’s talking a bout a report of information that he wants Ellie to fact-check, to look at carefully to make sure it is all correct. He says, “I don’t want a repeat of what happened last year.” A “repeat” would be when something happens again. In this case, it soun ds like something bad happened last year and Takagi doesn’t want that to happen again.

Ellie asks, “What happened last year? I wasn’t work ing here then. Takagi answers, “Last year’s report had a lot of small ina ccuracies and a few major errors.” “Inaccuracies” (inaccuracies) are things t hat are not correct, things that are wrong. “To be accurate” means to be correct. “T o be inaccurate” means to be not correct, or wrong. So, “inaccuracies” are thing s that are wrong. Takagi says

these were “small inaccuracies,” meaning not very i mportant. However, there were also some “major,” or important or big, “error s” (errors). An “error” is something that is wrong, a mistake.

Takagi says, “We ended up,” meaning we had to, as a  result – “We ended up having to issue a second version of the report.” “T o issue” (issue) here means to publish or to officially present something to a gro up of people. Takagi had to issue “a second version” (version). Let’s say I hav e a web page. The first time I put up the web page, I’m happy with it, but a week later, I decide I want to make some changes. So I go in and I change the website –  maybe I change the color or I add some photographs to the website. The origi nal web page is my “first version.” After I make the changes, that’s my “seco nd version.”

“Version,” then, refers to the form of something. You could write a report and then a month later decide you want to change the re port. So you make the changes and then you give the report to your boss a gain. You say, “This is the second version of this report.” “Version” is used a  lot in software, in computer applications. We talk about 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 – these a re different versions of a computer application or an app that has improvement s or changes to it. Takagi is talking about “issuing a second version of the repo rt” – an update, a report that has been changed and corrected.

Ellie says, “Okay, but I thought it had already bee n signed off on by the department heads.” “To sign (sign) off on” somethin g means to approve of something, to say something is okay. A “department”  (department) is a part or section or division inside of a company. A “departm ent head” (head) is the person who is the boss of that section or division of the company. Ellie is saying that she thought this report had already been appro ved by, signed off on by, the department heads.

Takagi says, “It has, but those are the same depart ment heads who skimmed the report last year and didn’t catch all those problem s.” Takagi is saying that yes, the department heads approved of this report, but t hey only “skimmed” the report last year. “To skim” (skim) means to read through s omething very quickly, not looking at every word in the report. Because the de partment heads only “skimmed” the report last year, the report had a bu nch of mistakes, a bunch of errors. That’s why they didn’t “catch” (catch) all those problems. “To catch” here means to find or identify a mistake or an error.

Takagi says, “I want you to go through it with a fi ne-tooth comb.” The expression “to go through something with a fine (fine) – tooth  (tooth) comb (comb)” means to look through something very carefully, to make sure  that everything is correct. A

“comb” is something you use to straighten your hair  or to put your hair back into place – hair on the top of your head, that is. We c all the little parts of a comb “teeth,” just like teeth in your mouth. “Fine-tooth  combs” are combs where the teeth are very close together. The idea, then, is t hat you are looking at very small issues, very small details, to make sure that every thing is correct.

Ellie says, “What should I check? Takagi says, “Eve rything. I want you to verify the facts and figures and to flag anything that is right wrong or even a little suspect.” “To verify” (verify) means to make sure t hat it is correct, to look at it closely and make sure it is true, make sure it is a ccurate. “Verify” comes from the Latin word “veritas” (veritas), meaning truth. Taka gi wants Ellie to verify the “facts” – that is, the information – and “figures” (figures). “Figures” refer to numbers.

The title of this episode, “Facts and Figures,” con tains an expression we often use in talking about information that has both word s and numbers to describe it. So, the “figures” here would be the numbers in the report. Takagi wants Ellie “to flag” (flag) anything that is outright wrong. “To f lag” means to draw attention to something. In this case, it probably means to mark it with a pen or a pencil so that Takagi can find that information easily when h e looks through the report. To flag something in general means to call attention t o it, to say, “Hey, look at this. There might be a problem with this.”

Something that is “outright (outright) wrong” is so mething that is obviously wrong, something that you don’t even have to go and invest igate. It is clearly wrong. Something that is a little “suspect” (suspect) is s omething that doesn’t seem right. It might be right. It might be wrong. You’re not ex actly sure, but it looks like it might be incorrect. If you say something “looks a l ittle suspect,” you’re saying it looks wrong but you’re not exactly sure.

Ellie says, “Okay, I’ll do that, but this will take  some time.” Takagi says, “What are you doing this weekend?” He, of course, is implying  that Ellie should work on this over the weekend. Ellie replies, “Nothing, now,” me aning, well, she won’t be able to do anything this weekend for fun on her own beca use now she’s going to be working on this report instead of relaxing as you s hould on the weekends.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Takagi: Before we disseminate this report, I need y ou to fact-check it. I don’t want a repeat of what happened last year.

 Ellie: What happened last year? I wasn’t working he re then.

Takagi: Last year’s report had a lot of small inacc uracies and a few major errors. We ended up having to issue a second version of the  report.

Ellie: Okay, but I thought it had already been sign ed off on by the department heads.

Takagi: It has, but those are the same department h eads who skimmed the report last year and didn’t catch all those problem s. I want you to go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

Ellie: What should I check?

Takagi: Everything. I want you to verify the facts and figures and to flag anything that is outright wrong or even a little suspect.

Ellie: Okay, I’ll do that, but this will take some time.

Takagi: What are you doing this weekend?

Ellie: Nothing, now.

# Reaching a Legal Settlement

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,197 – Reaching a Legal Settlement.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,197. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com, where there is no singing, but there is a Learning Guide for this episode that you can downlo ad right after you become a member of ESL Podcast. The Learning Guide contains a complete transcript of everything we say.

This episode is a dialogue between Nadia and Andre about legal problems. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nadia: I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don ’t want a long trial.

Andre: Relax. This case will never go to trial. For  disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.

Nadia: If we do go to court, the legal fees could s kyrocket. I couldn’t afford that.

Andre: If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.

Nadia: All right, but what if they don’t want to ad mit wrongdoing?

Andre: If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to . They’ll simply pay out.

Nadia: Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll b e able to talk freely about it.

Andre: Well, that might be a problem. Many settleme nts require confidentiality – from both parties.

Nadia: You mean if I settle, I can’t talk about it?

Andre: If there is a confidentiality clause, you’d be in breach of contract if you discussed the settlement.

Nadia: I didn’t know that. You mean I can’t talk ab out what they did to me without getting my day in court?

Andre: That’s the long and short of it.

Nadia: I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!

[end of dialogue]

Nadia begins by saying, “I’m not sure about this ci vil lawsuit.” There are two kinds of issues that involve the court system, the legal system, in the United States. One is “criminal” – that’s when you break a  law, such as one against stealing or a law against killing someone. That wou ld be a “criminal offense.” A “civil” (civil) issue is one where you do something  wrong to someone else and the other person tries to get, usually, money from you.

For example, I’m driving down the street and I acci dentally hit your car. You could try to get money from me. This would be what we would call a “civil action,” when you go to the government – to the court system , to the legal system – and try to get the government to force me to give you m oney. We would call this a “civil lawsuit” (lawsuit). A “lawsuit” is when I fi le a complaint, if you will, a legal case against you with the government to try to get you to pay me money for something you did wrong.

There are many different kinds of civil lawsuits in  the U.S. Most of them involve getting money from another person or another organi zation who did something wrong to you. Nadia says, “I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don’t want a long trial.” A “trial” (trial) refers to the time when y ou go in front of a judge in a court in order to decide if you are going to win your lawsui t or not. Andre says, “Relax. This case will never go to trial,” meaning you will  never have to go in front of a judge. “For disputes of this kind, neither party wa nts to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.”

A “dispute” (dispute) is a disagreement or an argum ent. The word “party” (party) here doesn’t refer to a celebration like a birthday  party, but rather to a person or an organization who is involved in a legal action –  in this case, a “civil lawsuit.” Andre says, “Neither party wants to fight it out in  court.” “To fight it out” means to continue arguing. “In court” means in a court room,  in a trial with a judge and lawyers and sometimes a “jury” (jury) – a group of people who decide who wins the case.

Andre says, “We almost always reach a settlement” ( settlement). A “settlement” is an agreement where you decide to give money to t he other person. Usually this happens without going in front of a judge. So I say, “I’m going to file a lawsuit against you.” I’m going to go to the court and ask the court to make you give me money. And you say, “Well, that’s not necessary. Le t’s just agree that I will give you some money right now.” That agreement is called  a “settlement.”

Nadia says, “If we do go to court,” meaning if we d o go in front of a judge, “the legal fees could skyrocket.” “Legal fees” (fees) re fers to money that you have to pay the lawyers and perhaps the court for having th is lawsuit. The verb “to skyrocket” (skyrocket) means to increase very quick ly, to increase dramatically. “The price of the house skyrocketed in the last yea r.” That means the price of the house went up very quickly in the past 12 months.

Nadia says that she’s afraid the legal fees could s kyrocket. “I couldn’t afford that,” she says, meaning “I would not have enough money for that.” Andre says, “If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too muc h about that.” Nadia says, “All right, but what if they don’t want to admit wr ongdoing?” “To admit” (admit) means to say that you did something wrong. “Wrongdo ing” (wrongdoing) – one word – refers to something that you did wrong, that  you did something wrong.

Andre says, “If we reach a settlement, they don’t n eed to,” meaning if we reach an agreement, they don’t have to say, “Yes, we made  a mistake.” He continues, “They’ll simply pay out.” “To pay (pay) out” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning to give someone a large amount of money, a lot of mone y, usually as part of some sort of settlement, some sort of agreement.

Nadia says, “Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll be able to talk freely about it.” “To talk freely” (freely) means to be able to tell anyone you want about something. In this case, it would mean to talk abou t perhaps what the other person did wrong to you. Andre says, “Well, that mi ght be a problem. Many settlements require confidentiality – from both par ties.” “Confidentiality” (confidentiality) refers to not talking about somet hing with anyone else. It refers to information that you cannot give to anyone else.

Many times when you work for a company, you have to  agree not to tell anyone outside of your company about what the company is d oing. That’s “confidentiality.” You have to not tell anyone the company secrets. Sometimes legal settlements require that you be quiet about t hat. You don’t tell anyone about what the other person or company did to you that ca used them to pay you money. So the agreement basically says, “You can’t tell anyone about what we

did.” That’s part of the agreement in which you wil l get money. I’ll give you money, but you can’t tell anyone about it.

That’s a “confidentiality agreement” – a promise no t to talk about something. This often requires that both parties to the agreement k eep quiet about what happened. “Parties” again means the people involved  or the organizations involved in the settlement. Nadia says, “You mean i f I settle, I can’t talk about it?” Notice the use of the verb there, “to settle.” “To settle” means to sign a settlement agreement.

Andre says, “If there is a confidentiality clause, you’d be in breach of contract if you discussed the settlement.” A “clause” (clause) refers to a section or a part of a legal agreement. If the settlement has a “confide ntiality clause,” a section that requires you not to talk about it, then if you did talk about it, you would be “in breach (breach) of contract.” A “contract” is an ag reement. The verb “to breach” means to break or violate.

A “breach of contract” is when someone violates the  contract, when someone doesn’t do what the contract or agreement says he’s  supposed to do. So, if there’s a “confidentiality clause” in the settlemen t and you talk about it, you are going to be “in breach of contract.” You, therefore , have broken the agreement, and usually when you break an agreement, when you d on’t follow an agreement, there are penalties that you have to pay. There are  things that you have to do as punishment.

Nadia says, “I didn’t know that. You mean I can’t t alk about what they did to me without getting my day in court?” “To get your day in court” means to actually go in front of a judge and talk about what happened as  part of a civil lawsuit. If you sign an agreement with someone, there is no court a ppearance. There is no day in court. You don’t go in front of a judge.

So what Nadia is asking is if it’s true that if she  signs this agreement, she won’t get to tell anyone about what this company or this organization did to her – that is, she won’t get her day in court to explain to the whole world what happened. Andre says, “That’s the long and short of it.” The expression “the long and short” of something means that is correct. That is an accu rate statement. We usually use this expression when we’re trying to give someo ne a short answer, or a summary of a longer story or a more complicated pie ce of information.

Someone may ask you, “Well, what happened yesterday ?” “Well,” you could say, “this person said this, and the other person said t hat, but the long and short of it is, we’re all going to lose our jobs.” “The long an d short” of something is a brief

statement of whatever that information is. You migh t say, “Well, why don’t you just say ‘the short of it?’” I don’t know, but that ’s not the expression. We say “the long and short of it,” even though it’s really just  the short version of some longer piece of information.

Nadia says, “I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!” The expression “justice (justice) is blind (blind)” is used to sho w that the law is fair, that the law doesn’t care about who you are. Nadia says that she  thinks “justice is blind,” meaning our legal system is fair, “only for the ric h” – only for people who have a lot of money.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nadia: I’m not sure about this civil lawsuit. I don ’t want a long trial.

Andre: Relax. This case will never go to trial. For  disputes of this kind, neither party wants to fight it out in court, so we almost always reach a settlement.

Nadia: If we do go to court, the legal fees could s kyrocket. I couldn’t afford that.

Andre: If we reach a settlement, you won’t have to worry too much about that.

Nadia: All right, but what if they don’t want to ad mit wrongdoing?

Andre: If we reach a settlement, they don’t need to . They’ll simply pay out.

Nadia: Even if they don’t admit it, at least I’ll b e able to talk freely about it.

Andre: That’s the long and short of it.

 Nadia: I guess justice is blind – but only for the rich!

# Failed Government Projects

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,198 – Failed Government Projects.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,198. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Mariana and Klau s about government projects that don’t seem to be very successful. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mariana: How long do you think it will be before the stadium is finished?

Klaus: Don’t hold your breath. The plan for the sta dium is fundamentally flawed, but the government rammed it down the throats of the voters.

Mariana: Do you really think the project is doomed?

Klaus: Haven’t you heard the reports of corruption and poor management? They’re cutting corners left and right. I wouldn’t be surprised if the stadium is being built with shoddy materials.

Mariana: Then the entire thing is a joke!

Klaus: Yes, and the joke is on us. Government offic ials are going through the motions, not caring about the results. All they care about is lining their pockets.

Mariana: I have heard about the cost overruns. Do y ou think the city will ever recoup the money spent on this project?

Klaus: Maybe a little, if we can sell the entire th ing as scrap metal!

[end of dialogue]

Mariana begins by asking, “How long do you think it  will be before the stadium is finished?” A “stadium” (stadium) is a large buildin g with many seats – many places to sit in it, usually – that is used for spo rting events or other large gatherings such as music concerts.

Most large cities in the U.S. and in most cities in  the world have stadiums that are used for playing sports. It may be a football stadi um in many parts of the world. Here in the U.S. there are baseball stadiums and fo otball stadiums. Some stadiums are used for playing more than one kind of  sport. Here in Los Angeles we have several large stadiums used for sporting ev ents and concerts – not only professional sporting events, but also ones for col lege sport teams.

Mariana is asking when the stadium is going to be f inished. Klaus says, “Don’t hold your breath.” The expression “Don’t hold (hold ) your breath (breath)” means don’t expect too much to happen very soon, or don’t  expect this to be completed anytime soon. We use this expression when we’re tel ling someone that they shouldn’t get too excited or they shouldn’t look fo rward to something too much because it is not likely it will happen anytime soo n.

The expression “to hold your breath” means to take air into your lungs and not to breathe out. We hold our breath when we, for exampl e, go under water. If you hold your breath for too long, of course, you could  eventually lose consciousness. You could, what we would say in Engl ish, “pass out.” “To pass out” means to become unconscious suddenly. That’s w hat would happen if you held your breath for too long. So the expression “D on’t hold your breath” means that you shouldn’t be waiting for something. If you  actually held your breath, you would probably pass out before anything good would happen.

Klaus says, “The plan for the stadium is fundamenta lly flawed, but the government rammed it down the throats of the voters .” To say something is “flawed” (flawed) means there is something wrong wi th it. It isn’t going to work properly. To say something is “fundamentally flawed ” means that the problems are so serious that you can’t fix it, that you migh t as well start again or get a new one. If you say that a plan is “fundamentally flawe d,” you’re saying that it’s so bad, it’s never going to work.

Klaus says that the plan for the stadium “is fundam entally flawed, but the government rammed it down the throats of the voters .” “To ram (ram)” something “down the throat” (throat) of someone or of a group  of people means to force someone or some group to do something that he or th ey didn’t really want to do. “To ram something down someone’s throat” is to say that they have to do it. They

don’t have any other choice. Even though it may loo k like they are saying yes to something, in fact they had no other option.

The “voters” are the people who vote in an election  in a democracy. So, “to ram something down the throats of the voters” is to tel l people voting they have no choice, they have to accept this. Sometimes we use this expression when you actually do have a choice. If you’re a voter, you can always vote no on something. But we use it when the government is usi ng some pressure or using some “tactic,” some strategy to make people do some thing that they don’t really want to do. They are persuading people to do someth ing by using arguments, perhaps, that aren’t completely honest.

Mariana says, “Do you really think the project is d oomed?” If something is “doomed” (doomed), it is expected to fail. It is so mething that will not work, will not be successful. If something or someone is “doom ed,” that thing or that person will not be successful – bad things will happen. Kl aus says, “Haven’t you heard the reports of corruption and poor management?” “Co rruption” (corruption) is when people in power, especially in the government,  do things that are dishonest, illegal, or unethical, often because the y are getting money illegally to do something. Corruption is a problem in all govern ments in every country in the world.

Klaus says, “They’re” – meaning the government – “T hey’re cutting corners left and right.” “To cut corners” (corners) means to not  do what you are supposed to do, in order to get something done more quickly. “T o cut corners” means to find a cheaper, faster way to do something, but in a way t hat lowers the quality of whatever it is you are doing. We usually use this e xpression “to cut corners” to mean to lower the cost of doing something to try to  save money, but often you’re saving money by doing something that you shouldn’t do or that might even be dangerous.

The expression “left and right” here means “in many  different places” or “in many different areas.” We put the two together – “to cut  corners left and right” – and we get an expression that means to try to save money i n many different parts of the project. Klaus says, “I wouldn’t be surprised if the stadium is being built with shoddy materials.” “Shoddy” (shoddy) is an adjective meaning of low qu ality – something that is poorly made, something that won’t last very long.

Mariana says, “Then the entire thing is a joke.” Wh en she says, “the entire thing is a joke” (joke), she doesn’t mean that it’s suppo sed to make you laugh. Here the word “joke” means that it wasn’t being done pro perly, and therefore is a

complete failure. Here the word “joke” is used in a n insulting way to describe some action or some plan or some project as being v ery poorly done and not worth taking seriously. Klaus says, “Yes, and the j oke is on us.” Here we see another meaning of the word “joke” in the expressio n, “The joke is on us.” “The joke is on us” means that someone has made us look stupid – someone has tricked us, someone has fooled us.

He says, “Government officials are going through the motions not caring about the results.” “To go through the motions” (motions)  means to do something but not with very much commitment – to do something wit hout trying very hard, to do something without being very enthusiastic about it.  “To go through the motions” means to do your job, to do what you’re supposed to  do, but not very well or not with very much dedication and interest. Klaus says,  “All they” – meaning the government officials, the people who work for the g overnment – “care about is lining their pockets.”

The expression “to line (line) one’s pockets (pocke ts)” means to do something in order to make a lot of money, usually to do it in a  corrupt way – illegally or unethically. It’s an expression we often use when we’re talking about corrupt government officials. They are getting money illega lly. They’re only doing what they are doing in order to make money. They are “li ning their pockets.” Your “pockets” are those things in your pants that you u se to put coins in or your keys in or your cellphone in. So, in effect they are put ting money into their own pockets and getting rich.

Mariana says, “I have heard about the cost overruns .” “Cost overruns” (overruns) refers to when a project costs more than you though t it would. You thought it would cost 100 million dollars and it ends up costi ng 500 million dollars. That’s a “cost overrun.” Most government projects have cost overruns. They say they’re only going to cost this amount of money, but then y ou find out it costs twice that much.

Mariana says, “Do you think the city will ever reco up the money spent on this project?” “To recoup (recoup) the money” means to g et the money back, to regain the money. What happens often in U.S. cities  is that the local government will help build the stadium. They will pay money to  build the stadium with the idea that eventually all the business that the stadium w ill bring will get that money back to them through taxes – that the city will, in  the end, make more money than it spent. Usually that’s not what happens.

Klaus says, “Maybe a little,” meaning maybe the cit y will get some of the money back that it spent to build this stadium. It will r ecoup some of the money. That will

happen, however, “only if we can sell the entire th ing as scrap metal.” “Scrap” (scrap) is something that is no longer used anymore  for what it was made to be used for. You could talk about “scraps of food” – f ood that you are not going to eat anymore or very small pieces of food. Some peop le feed their dog “scraps” from the table. The food that they are not eating, they give to the dog.

“Scrap metal” (metal) are small pieces of metal tha t are no longer being used and that are usually melted down and used for something  else. Klaus is saying the only way the city will make money or recoup some of  its money on this project is if they tear the stadium down and sell it as scrap metal.

Now, let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mariana: How long do you think it will be before the stadium is finished?

Klaus: Don’t hold your breath. The plan for the sta dium is fundamentally flawed, but the government rammed it down the throats of the voters.

Mariana: Do you really think the project is doomed?

Klaus: Haven’t you heard the reports of corruption and poor management? They’re cutting corners left and right. I wouldn’t be surprised if the stadium is being built with shoddy materials.

Mariana: Then the entire thing is a joke!

# Eating on the Run

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,199 – Eating on the Run.

This episode is a dialogue between Sam and Leticia about eating when you don’t have very much time. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sam: Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for l unch, this microwaved burrito?

Leticia: That’s all I have time for. It’s better th an just eating it out of the package, right?

Sam: That does not look appetizing. I see indigesti on in your future.

Leticia: It’s filling and that’s all I care about. I need to gulp down something before the meeting at 1:00.

Sam: Why don’t you brown bag it? Even if it’s somet hing premade, you won’t have to rely on instant food.

Leticia: Who has the time to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days. Normally, I munch on candy bars o r bags of chips and forgo lunch altogether.

Sam: That’s not very healthy.

Leticia: No, but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this. I have a stash in my desk. Do you want to take a look ?

Sam: That collection makes fast food look like haut e cuisine!

 [end of dialogue]

Sam says to Leticia, “Wait a second.” We sometimes say this in conversation, informally, when we are surprised by something or d on’t understand something and need to ask someone a question to clarify, to u nderstand better. Sam is apparently confused by something Leticia is doing.

He says, “Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for lunch, this microwaved burrito?” “Microwaved” means something is put into an oven called a “microwave” (microwave). “Microwave” is a verb in E nglish – “to microwave.” A “burrito” (burrito) is a food in the U.S. normally identified with Mexico, even though the burritos you get in the U.S. probably do n’t taste anything like the ones you would get in Mexico.

A “burrito” is a food made with a “tortilla,” which  is a flat, thin piece of dough, that is filled with beans, meat, rice, and cheese. Actua lly, if you go to most parts of Mexico, you won’t really find a burrito, at least i n traditional Mexican restaurants. They’re much more popular here in the U.S. You can buy frozen burritos at a grocery store in the U.S. You can take them home an d put them in a microwave to heat them up and eat them. I don’t, but some peo ple do. It’s an easy, quick thing that you can heat up and eat.

Leticia says, “That’s all I have time for,” meaning  she doesn’t have time to prepare any other kind of food. She says, “It’s bet ter than just eating it out of the package, right?” “To eat something out of the packa ge” (package) means to eat something without putting it on a plate first. To b uy something in some sort of container – plastic or cardboard, say – and eating it without putting it on a plate. Some people do that when they are in a hurry. They may eat food right out of the package.

Sam says, “That does not look appetizing.” “Appetiz ing” (appetizing) means it makes you want to eat something because it looks go od or it smells good. Sam says that this microwaved burrito “does not look ap petizing.” He says, instead, “I see indigestion in your future.” “Indigestion” (ind igestion) is pain or discomfort you feel in your stomach after you eat food that is n’t very good, or food that for some reason your body doesn’t like very much. Sam i s making a joke here. He says, “I see indigestion in your future,” meaning i f you eat that, you are going to get indigestion. You are going to get some sort of stomach pains or discomfort.

Leticia says, however, “It’s filling and that’s all  I care about.” If you describe food as being “filling” (filling), you mean that it make s you feel full and satisfied so that

you don’t need to eat anything else. Leticia says, “I need to gulp down something before the meeting at one o’clock.” “To gulp” (gulp ) usually means to drink something very quickly. “To gulp down” (down) is a two-word phrasal verb that means to drink or eat something very quickly.

Sam says, “Why don’t you brown bag it?” “To brown b ag” (bag) means to prepare your own lunch at home and bring it with yo u. Traditionally, at least when I was growing up, if you were going to bring your l unch to school or to your job, you would put it in a small paper bag that was brow n in color. Why brown? I don’t know. That’s just what was popular.

We now have a verb “to brown bag,” which means to bring your own lunch from home. When I was in school growing up, we had to br ing our lunch every day to school. The school did not serve lunch. You couldn’ t buy lunch at school. They didn’t give you anything to eat, and since you were  there from eight o’clock in the morning until three or four o’clock in the afternoo n, you had to bring your own food to eat. I had to “brown bag it” every day that  I went to school. I had to bring my own lunch.

Sam asks why Leticia doesn’t bring her own lunch. H e says, “Even if it’s something premade, you won’t have to rely on instan t food.” “Premade” (premade) means that it has already been prepared, usually before you buy it. So, you can buy, say, a salad in the store. We migh t say the salad is “premade.” It’s made for you. You don’t have to do anything. You just have to open up the package and eat it. This way, Sam says, “you won’t have to rely on instant (instant) food.”

“Instant food” is food that is prepared very quickl y, with very little time. A microwave burrito would be an example of instant fo od, I guess. There are also many kinds of soup that you can buy. You just have to add hot water to this little cup and you get a cup of soup. That would be “insta nt soup.” It is made almost instantly, very quickly. Leticia says, “Who has tim e to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days.” “Normally,” she says, “I munch on candy bars or bags of chips and forgo lunch alto gether.”

“To munch (munch) on” something is a two-word phras al verb meaning to eat a small amount of something, but not as part of your meal. If you are, for example, sitting at your desk at work and it’s ten o’clock i n the morning, it’s too early for lunch, but you’re hungry. So, you decide to munch o n some potato chips. You open a bag of potato chips and you eat one or two. You are munching on the bag of potato chips. Well, actually you’re munching on the potato chips. If you’re

eating the actual bag that the potato chips are in,  you should probably go and get some real food.

Leticia says she normally munches on candy bars or bags of chips and forgoes lunch altogether. “To forgo” (forgo) means to decid e not to do something that you would normally do. “To forgo a lunch” means not to eat lunch even though normally you would eat lunch. “Altogether” (altoget her) means completely or entirely. Sam says that forgoing lunch altogether i s “not very healthy.”

Leticia says, “No” – she agrees – “but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this.” “To be on the run” (run) here  means to be doing a lot of different things and going off in different places in a short amount of time. It can just mean to be extremely busy. Usually, though, I think we use this expression when you have to move from one place to another, ei ther within your building where you work or perhaps in the city where you liv e. You have to go to this appointment over here, and then you have another ap pointment in another part of the city, and so forth.

Leticia says, “I have a stash in my desk.” A “stash ” (stash) is a collection of something that you are storing to use in the future . However, usually a stash is put somewhere where other people can’t see it or pe rhaps find it. The word “stash” is often used when we are describing keepin g or storing something illegally, or perhaps for reasons that have to do w ith breaking the law. I have a stash of money that I stole from the bank buried in  my backyard. I’m just kidding. I don’t actually have a stash of money that I stole  from a bank buried in my backyard. It’s somewhere else.

Leticia has a stash of candy bars, I guess, in her desk somewhere – hidden in her desk so no one can find them. “Do you want to t ake a look?” We can guess now that Leticia is at her desk because she is now going to show Sam her stash of food. Sam then says, after looking at it, “That collection makes fast food look like haute cuisine!” “Fast food” is food that is pr epared very quickly that is often not very healthy. A McDonald’s hamburger would be a  good example of “fast food.” We talk about “fast food restaurants” – rest aurants that will give you food very quickly.

The term “haute (haute) cuisine (cuisine)” is origi nally a French one. It refers to high quality food, especially good, French-style fo od. The French, at least in the United States, have the reputation of having excell ent food, as they have that reputation in other countries as well throughout the world. There are actually quite a few French who live in the western part of Los Angeles, in the area where

I live, and there are some apparently excellent Fre nch restaurants here as well. Not as good as in Paris, of course.

Sam is making a joke here. He’s comparing the candy  bars and bags of chips that Leticia is showing him to fast food, saying, “ This is even worse than fast food.” In fact, fast food, compared to that, looks like haute cuisine. It’s much higher in quality than what you are eating, which i s worse than fast food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sam: Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for l unch, this microwaved burrito?

Leticia: That’s all I have time for. It’s better th an just eating it out of the package, right?

Sam: That does not look appetizing. I see indigesti on in your future.

Leticia: It’s filling and that’s all I care about. I need to gulp down something before the meeting at 1:00.

Sam: Why don’t you brown bag it? Even if it’s somet hing premade, you won’t have to rely on instant food.

Leticia: Who has the time to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days. Normally, I munch on candy bars o r bags of chips and forgo lunch altogether.

Sam: That’s not very healthy.

Leticia: No, but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this. I have a stash in my desk. Do you want to take a look ?

Sam: That collection makes fast food look like haut e cuisine!

# Learning a Skilled Trade

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,200 – Learning a Skilled Trade.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,200. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit ESLPod.com – and by “visit,” I mean go there,  of course. Take a look at our Learning Guide service we provide, where you can ge t a complete transcript of all of our current episodes by becoming a member of  ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialogue about learning a skilled  trade – that is, learning to do something with your hands and mind in order to make  money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeannine: What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?

Orlando: I’m going to trade school. My father was a  stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something different.

Jeannine: Like what?

Orlando: Maybe I’ll study to become an electrician or plumber. Those are skills that are always in demand.

Jeannine: Don’t they have long apprenticeships?

Orlando: Yes, but it’s better than training to be a  machinist or technician. It’s easier to open your own shop as an electrician or p lumber.

Jeannine: With your skills, you can always get a jo b as a carpenter.

Orlando: I think carpentry is a dying art. Most peo ple don’t get furniture or other things custom-made anymore.

Jeannine: You know, you could always take a complet ely different path, learning a completely different skilled trade.

Orlando: Like what?

 Jeannine: You could become a medical or dental tech nician or even get a cosmetology degree.

Orlando: Are you serious?! Would you want these han ds cutting your hair?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jeannine saying to Orlando , “What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?” “To gr aduate” means to complete some level of schooling – in this case, high school . Orlando says, “I’m going to a trade school.” A “trade” (trade) is one of the many  different jobs involving the use of your hands to either make something or to fix so mething. We’ll talk about several different examples of “trades” in a minute.

A “trade school” is a school that teaches you the t echnical skills and gives you the knowledge you need to perform certain kinds of jobs, often jobs that don’t require a four-year university or college degree. “ Trade schools” are sometimes called “vocational schools” – schools that teach yo u things that will allow you to get a job right away, but that don’t require a four -year education. Orlando says he’s going to a trade school.

“My father,” he says, “was a stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something di fferent.” One of the many trades you can study for and work in is a “mason” ( mason). A mason is a person who works with stone or brick and builds things out  of those materials. If you’re building a building that is made of stone or brick,  you may need a mason. Many buildings nowadays – most buildings nowadays – are not built out of stone or brick, but some still are, and if you are going to make a building or, say, a wall with bricks, you would want a mason to do that for you. That’s a particular trade.

Another example of a trade is a “mechanic” (mechani c). A “mechanic” is a person who repairs or fixes machines that are broken, espe cially cars and trucks and other vehicles. If you’re having problems with your  car, you will most likely take it to a mechanic – a “car mechanic” – who can fix the engine or whatever is wrong with your car.

It used to be as recently as twenty, thirty years a go that many people would fix their own cars. People would try to fix their own e ngines. But nowadays, that isn’t quite as popular, perhaps because car engines have become more complicated due to the computers in the cars. I remember, certa inly back in the 1980s, people trying to fix their own cars – my friends, for exam ple. I never tried to do that

because I don’t really know much about car engines.  But if you do know a lot about car engines, you could become a “mechanic.”

Orlando wants to try something different. Jeannine says, “Like what?” Orlando says, “Maybe I’ll study to be an electrician or a p lumber.” An “electrician” (electrician) is a person who works installing and maintaining electrical equipment. If you need to have electricity in a bui lding you would call an electrician, and that person would put the wires an d the necessary wires and equipment needed to have electricity.

A “plumber” (plumber) – notice that we don’t pronou nce the “b” in “plumber” – is the person who installs – that is, who puts in – an d maintains and repairs pipes and systems that move water in and out of a buildin g. A plumber would be needed if you wanted a bathroom or a kitchen. If yo u want to have a toilet or a shower in your bathroom, you would need to call a p lumber who would be able to put one in or fix it if there was a problem with it . All of my uncles were plumbers. My grandfather was a plumber. My great-grandfather was a plumber. I come from a whole family of plumbers.

In fact, if you go to my home city of St. Paul, Min nesota, and you drive down the street, you might see a car that says “McQuillan Pl umbing” on it. Those are my cousins. There’s been a “McQuillan Plumbing” busine ss in St. Paul, Minnesota since the nineteenth century. My father was the onl y member of his family, the only male member of his family, who did not become a plumber. He became a teacher, which is probably why I’m a teacher and no t a plumber. I think I would have made more money as a plumber, however.

In any case, Orlando is thinking of becoming an ele ctrician or a plumber. He says, “Those are skills that are always in demand.”  Something that is “in demand” (demand) is something that people want – in  this case, something people are willing to pay for. Since we’ll probably  always need bathrooms, we’ll probably always need plumbers. That’s why that is a  skill that is always “in demand.”

Jeannine says, “Don’t they have long apprenticeship s?” An “apprenticeship” (apprenticeship) is a period of time when someone i n a trade – such as electricians and plumbers – works for another perso n in order to learn how to do his specific job. If you want to become a plumber o r an electrician, you will study for a certain amount of time, but then you will wor k for a few years for someone else who will teach you what you really need to kno w.

The trades, such as electrician and plumber, requir e more than just time in a classroom learning from a teacher. You have to go o ut there and actually do it in order to learn it, and that’s why we have “apprenti ceships.” These are periods of time when the people who want to become electrician s and plumbers work for other electricians and plumbers who teach them all the things, or many of the things, they need to know.

Orlando says, “Yes” – meaning yes, these trades do have long apprenticeships – “but it’s better than training to be a machinist or  technician.” “To train” (train) is to get the skills in order to do something. The verb “ train” is a very general one used in many different situations. Usually it’s used whe n you are talking about a specific kind of task or job.

So, you can train to be a teacher. That’s a specifi c job, a specific skill or set of skills you need to learn. You can train to be a plu mber. You can train to be a secretary. You could train to be a computer program mer. All of these would be possible uses of the verb “to train.” “To train,” t hen, is to study and/or practice in order to learn how to do a specific thing. We also use the verb “to train” when you’re preparing for an athletic event. If you are going to run a marathon, you might “train” for the marathon – spend time prepari ng for it.

Orlando refers to “training to be a machinist or te chnician.” A “machinist” (machinist) is a person who operates a machine in a  factory. The term “technician” (technician) refers to anyone who has technical skills for doing this particular kind of job, usually a job that doesn’t require a lot of extra training. For example, there are “lab” or laboratory technicians.  Hospitals, for example, have “laboratory technicians” who work to determine what ’s in your blood. Those people aren’t doctors. They are, however, working w ith special machinery that requires technical skills.

Orlando says, “It’s easier to open your own shop as  an electrician or plumber.” The word “shop” here means business. Jeannine says,  “With your skills, you can always get a job as a carpenter.” A “carpenter” (ca rpenter) is a person who makes things out of wood. Orlando says, however, “I  think carpentry is a dying art.”

A “dying (dying) art (art)” is something that is be coming less and less common, that fewer people are interested in nowadays than, say, in the past. “Most people don’t get furniture or other things custom-made any more.” If something is “custom (custom) – made (made),” it is produced or made just for you. There’s only one of those. In British English there’s a won derful word, “bespoke” (bespoke), that describes basically the same idea.

 Jeannine says, “You know, you could always take a c ompletely different path, learning a completely different skilled trade.” A “ path” (path) is a way that you get from one place to another. In this case, Jeannine i s talking about how Orlando could do something completely different – not be a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician. He could learn a different “skilled tr ade” – that is, a different job similar to the jobs we’ve been talking about.

Orlando says, “Like what?” Jeannine says, “You coul d become a medical or dental technician or even get a cosmetology degree. ” A “dental (dental) technician” is a person who makes teeth – artificia l teeth, of course – and other things that are used by a dentist. Jeannine suggest s that Orlando could also get a “cosmetology (cosmetology) degree.” “Cosmetology”  refers to the business of making people’s hair, skin, and/or nails more attra ctive.

Orlando says, “Are you serious?! Would you want the se hands cutting your hair?” I’m not sure why, but Orlando apparently feels he w ouldn’t do a very good job cutting anyone’s hair.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jeannine: What are you going to do now that you’ve graduated from high school?

Orlando: I’m going to trade school. My father was a  stone and brick mason and my brother is a mechanic, but I think I’m going to try something different.

Jeannine: Like what?

Orlando: Maybe I’ll study to become an electrician or plumber. Those are skills that are always in demand.

Jeannine: Don’t they have long apprenticeships?

# Types of Non-alcoholic Drinks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,201 – Types of Non-Alcoholic Drinks.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,201. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to have a dialogue bet ween Asa and Elizabeth about drinking things that don’t have alcohol in th em. Sounds a little boring, but let’s get started anyway.

[start of dialogue]

Asa: What can I get you to drink?

Elizabeth: I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.

Asa: Are you sure you don’t want something else? I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonade, and fruit punch.

Elizabeth: No, thanks. I’m trying to cut back on my  sugar intake.

Asa: In that case, how about an energy drink, sport s drink, or bottled tea?

Elizabeth: No, really, I’m fine with water.

Asa: Ah, I bet you’d like some tea or coffee, right ?

Elizabeth: No, all I want is a glass of water.

Asa: Okay, do you want tap water or bottled water, flavored water or carbonated?

Elizabeth: Do you mean to tell me you have all of t hose drinks in your refrigerator?

Asa: It pays to own a beverage company.

 [end of dialogue]

Asa begins our dialogue by saying to Elizabeth, “What can I get you to drink?” Asa is offering to get something for Elizabeth to d rink. Elizabeth says, “I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.” Asa says, “Are you sure yo u don’t want something else?” He then lists, or gives a list of, the other things  he can get for Elizabeth.

He says, “I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonad e and fruit punch.” A “soft (soft) drink” is also called a “soda.” In some part s of the country it’s called “soda pop” (pop). Or if you’re from Minnesota, it’s calle d simply “pop.” Soft drinks are typically “carbonated beverages,” or things you dri nk. “Carbonated” just means it has little bubbles in it. Things like Coca-Cola and  7 Up are “soft drinks.”

Asa says he has soft drinks. He also has “orange ju ice,” which is obviously the liquid made by squeezing an orange. The word “juice ” (juice) usually refers to the liquid that you get from a fruit. Asa also has “lem onade” (lemonade). “Lemonade” is made with lemon juice, but you put a little bit of lemon juice into a lot of water. Lemon juice itself is a little strong to drink with out mixing it in with water, whereas orange juice can be drunk just as it is. In fact, y ou don’t want to mix orange juice in with water. It’s not strong enough.

Finally, Asa says he has “fruit punch” (punch). Fru it punch is made by mixing in the juices of several different types of fruit, oft en combined with sugar. Elizabeth says, “No, thanks. I’m trying to cut back on my sug ar intake.” “To cut back on” something is to reduce the amount of something, to have less of something. Someone may say, “I’m trying to cut back on coffee”  – that means he’s still drinking coffee but he’s trying to drink less coffe e than he did before.

Elizabeth is “cutting back on her sugar intake” (in take). “Intake” is the amount of something you eat or drink, usually. So, your “suga r intake” would be the amount of sugar that you eat or drink. Asa says, “In that case,” meaning since you are trying to cut back on your sugar intake, “how about  an energy drink, sports drink, or bottled tea?” Interestingly enough, all three of  these things can also have sugar in them.

Let’s start with the first one, which is “energy (e nergy) drink.” An energy drink is a drink that is supposed to, well, give you more ener gy so that you can get up and do something. These are drinks that often contain a  lot of caffeine, but they often also contain a lot of sugar.

“Sports drinks” are drinks designed for people who are exercising or participating in some sort of athletic event. A sports drink ofte n contains things that will help replace sodium, potassium, and other what are calle d “electrolytes” that you may lose by “sweating” – that is, when water comes out of your skin because you are working so hard at the physical activity.

“Bottled tea” is, well, just what it sounds like – tea that is put into a bottle and sold. It’s not the kind of tea that you make by boi ling hot water and mixing with tea leaves. Bottled tea is something you can buy in  a store and is usually drunk cold. Again, a lot of bottled tea also has sugar in  it.

Elizabeth says, “No, really. I’m fine with water.” To say you’re “fine with” something means you’re okay with this. You don’t ne ed anything else. Asa says, “Ah, I bet you’d like some tea or coffee, right?” “ I bet” means I’m guessing. “I bet you’d like some tea or coffee,” Asa says. Tea, of c ourse, is a hot drink made by placing hot water into a cup with tea leaves in it or another container that has tea leaves in it.

Coffee is a hot drink that was invented by God so t hat we would be able to function properly in the morning – we would be able  to get up and do our work properly in the morning. I have coffee every day. C offee is made from coffee beans which are crushed or ground up before hot wat er is poured through them.

Elizabeth says, “No, all I want is a glass of water .” Asa says, “Okay, do you want tap water or bottled water, flavored water or carbo nated?” Water that comes from your kitchen sink is called “tap (tap) water.” In o rder to get water out of the sink in your kitchen or in your bathroom, you have to turn the tap so that the water can come out of the pipe. You open the tap and you clos e the tap. “Tap water,” then, is water that you just get from whatever water syst em your house or building is connected to.

In most big cities in the United States, the city g overnment controls the water, and there are water pipes that go to every house. T hat’s “tap water.” Now, the water that is provided by the government sometimes isn’t very good in terms of the taste. So, some people prefer to get “bottled w ater” – water that you buy at a store that has been specially cleaned or filtered.

“Flavored water” is water that has some sort of add ed fruit or other vegetable flavor to it. This has become quite popular in the U.S. in the last few years, especially at certain cafes and restaurants. They w ill put fruit into the water. Like, oh, I don’t know, strawberries, for example, or veg etables such as cucumbers. They put that into the water and it tastes, well, l ike strawberries or cucumbers.

 I really don’t like flavored water, myself. I don’t  know why they do that. Perhaps because the tap water tastes so bad, instead of fil tering it or getting bottled water they put some sort of fruit or vegetable into it. P ersonally I think it’s disgusting, but some people like it. Asa is offering Elizabeth some flavored water or carbonated water. “Carbonated water” is water with dissolved “carbon dioxide” in it, which causes it to have little bubbles just lik e soda.

Elizabeth says, “Do you mean to tell me you have al l of those drinks in your refrigerator?” The question form “Do you mean to te ll me” is used when you don’t believe what the other person is saying and you wan t to make sure that you understand him correctly. That’s why Elizabeth uses  it here. She is surprised that Asa has all of these different kinds of drinks in h is refrigerator.

“Do you mean to tell me you have all of those drink s in your refrigerator?” she asks. He says, “It pays to own a beverage company.”  “Beverages” (beverages) are drinks. Any kind of drink can be called a “beve rage.” We find out that Asa “owns” – is the owner of – a company that makes the se different beverages. That’s why he says, “It pays (pays) to own a bevera ge company.”

“It pays to” means it is beneficial to or there are  advantages to doing or having something. This is actually a quite useful expressi on. “It pays to study before a test.” That means it will be to your benefit. It wi ll be advantageous for you to study before you go and take a test; or, “It pays t o prepare yourself for an interview.” It will be good for you. It will benefi t you if you do that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Asa: What can I get you to drink?

Elizabeth: I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.

Asa: Are you sure you don’t want something else? I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonade, and fruit punch.
