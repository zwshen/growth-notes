This episode is a dialogue between Seamus and Cathy  about getting married. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Seamus: What’s that?

Cathy: It’s a planning book for our wedding.

Seamus: We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.

Cathy: I know, but there are so many things to plan . We have to book the hall far in advance, you know, and once we set the date, we have to send out save-the- date notifications to our friends and family.

Seamus: I thought that the point of putting off the  wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us time to pl an – later.

Cathy: It is, but it’s never too early to start pla nning for a wedding. I’m meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the bal l rolling.

Seamus: A wedding coordinator?! We don’t need a wed ding coordinator. We can make all of the arrangements ourselves.

Cathy: You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception. There are caterers, photographers and videographers , entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the swans  and the doves), and . . .

Seamus: Are you serious?! You’re not planning a wed ding. You’re starting a circus!

Our dialogue begins with Seamus asking Cathy, “What 's that?” Cathy says, “It's a planning book for our wedding.” A “wedding” is when  two people get married. It's the ceremony in which two people get married. They promise, usually, to be with the other person until they die. Of course, a lot of them are lying because they don't stay with the person until they die, but that 's the idea anyway. That's what you are thinking when you get married, and you get married in a ceremony called your “wedding.”

Seamus says, “We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.” Seamus is saying that they are still 18 months away from the actual wedding. He's a little surprised, I think, that Cathy is already planning the wedding. Cathy says, “I know, but there are so many things to plan. We have  to book the hall far in advance.” “To book” means to reserve, to make a res ervation. The “hall” (hall) refers to the place where the wedding reception wil l take place.

The word “reception” means, basically, the party – the celebration that will happen after the wedding. We call that the “wedding  reception.” We do not call it the wedding party, because the “wedding party” refe rs to the people . . . the bride, the groom – the woman and man getting marrie d – and the other people who are in their wedding, who are their close frien ds or family members, typically. Cathy says that they have to book the hall “far in advance.” The phrase “far in advance” means long before something happens, well before the actual date that this event will take place. Cathy says they “have to book the hall far in advance.”

She also says, “Once we set the date, we have to se nd out save-the-date notifications to our friends and family.” “To set ( set) the date” means to select or determine the exact date that you are going to get married. “We're going to get married on June 23rd. That's the day we will get ma rried.” That is “setting the date.” You can set the date for any important event . You can set the date for the beginning of a new project in your company.

It's common in the United States, when two people d ecide to get married, to tell their friends and family as soon as they have set the date. They do this so that their friends and family can “save the date.” “To s ave a date” means to put it on your calendar and not plan anything else because yo u want to go to this event. “To save the date” means to leave that date free so  that you can attend, in this case, the wedding. A “notification” is either a let ter or an email or some way of communicating news to you. “Save-the-date notificat ions” are often sent out as little postcards, although nowadays I guess you wou ld send an email to tell

people the day that you are getting married so that  they will be able to save the date.

Seamus says, “I thought that the point of putting o ff the wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us tim e to plan – later.” Seamus is explaining why he's a little surprised that Cathy wants to start planning the wedding. He says, “I thought the point of putting o ff the wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off.” The “point” he re means the purpose, the reason for doing something. Seamus is saying that I  thought the reason we were putting off the wedding was to take the pressure of f. “To put off” something means to delay it, to decide you're going to do it at a later date.

“To take the pressure off” means to do something th at will make a situation less stressful, perhaps by making it at a later date so you have more time to do whatever it is that is causing you stress. Seamus a nd Cathy apparently decided that they would finish school – perhaps they are co llege students – before getting married. That's why they put off the wedding until after they finish school. This was done to take the pressure off of them – to make  the situation less stressful, so they don't have to worry about studying for scho ol and planning for their wedding.

Cathy says, “It is,” meaning that is the reason why  we put off the wedding, “but it's never too early to start planning for a weddin g.” Cathy says, “I'm meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the ball rol ling.” A “wedding coordinator” is a person whose job is to help other people plan their weddings. Some people hire a wedding coordinator to help them find out wh ich hall they should book, which caterer they should use. A “caterer” is a per son who provides the food for an event such as a wedding and so forth. I did not have a wedding coordinator. My wedding coordinator was my now wife.

However, some people who have more money may actual ly hire someone to help them plan their wedding. The word “coordinator ” comes from the verb “to coordinate,” which means to organize things – to ma ke sure that everything is working properly, that everyone is doing the right thing, the thing they're supposed to do. Cathy is meeting with the wedding c oordinator next week “to get the ball rolling.” The expression “to get the ball rolling” means to get something started, to make something begin to happen. We ofte n use that expression when we’re talking about a large project, for example.

Seamus says, “A wedding coordinator?!” He's very su rprised. “We don't need a wedding coordinator,” he says. “We can make all [of ] the arrangements ourselves.” “Arrangements” here means plans. Seamus  is saying that they don't

need a wedding coordinator. Cathy disagrees. She sa ys, “You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception.” “To  go into” something here means to be involved in something, to be a requirem ent for something else to happen.

“To pull off” something or “to pull something off” is a phrasal verb meaning to successfully implement or execute something – to ma ke something happen successfully. That's “to pull off.” We usually use that phrasal verb when it may be very complicated or difficult to be successful at d oing something. Cathy says that Seamus has no idea – doesn't know – how difficult it is to pull off a wedding and reception. He has no idea what goes into that plann ing.

Cathy says, “There are caterers, photographers and videographers, entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the s wans and the doves), and . . .” And here Seamus interrupts her. Let's go back and e xplain what she was talking about. She says there are caterers. A “caterer” is the person who makes the food, who prepares the food for the big event, as w e mentioned earlier.

A “photographer,” of course, would be someone who t akes photographs, pictures. A “videographer” would be someone who mak es a movie of your event. Nowadays, it's very popular for people to hire some one to make a little movie about their wedding. I never had this, but I got ma rried, I guess, before this became popular. “Entertainers” are people who sing or dance or do something to entertain or to keep people happy at a large event.

“Ice sculptors” are people who make little figures or statues out of ice. For some reason, at American weddings it’s very popular, at least in some places, for people to get a sculpture made out of ice, usually in the shape of some animal, and use that in the wedding reception. Usually it's  placed near the food. When my oldest brother got married – this was back in the early 1970s – he and his wife had someone make a swan, which is a kind of an imal. They hired an ice sculptor to make this figure out of ice.

“Animal trainers” are people who make animals behav e or make animals perform tricks, I suppose. “Swans,” we mentioned, refers to  a type of bird. “Doves” are another type of bird. Cathy is saying, I guess, tha t she wants to have actual animals at her wedding. That is not typical. That is not usual or normal. Having someone make an ice sculpture for you is not that u nusual, but certainly having animals at your wedding (other than perhaps your in -laws – the relatives of your spouse, of the person you are marrying) is not typi cal, is not common.

Seamus says, “Are you serious?! You're not planning  a wedding. You're starting a circus!” A “circus” (circus) is a kind of enterta inment. It's basically a large show that involves a lot of animals and animals doing tr icks, that sort of thing. Seamus is very surprised that Cathy is mentioning having a nimals at the wedding, and he should be surprised because that is a very strange thing. Maybe Seamus should think again about marrying Cathy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
