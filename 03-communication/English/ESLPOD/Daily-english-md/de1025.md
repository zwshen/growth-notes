This episode is a dialogue between Lorenzo and Pame la about something that a lot of people are talking about nowadays: Internet privacy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t post all of those photos on soc ial media sites.

Pamela: Why not? Only my friends and family are going to see them.

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t be so sure. And I wouldn’t post  all of that personal data either, or divulge personal information. You don’t know who may gain access to your page.

Pamela: There are privacy safeguards on this websit e. I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.

Lorenzo: Well, the people who run the website itsel f have access. They could track what you do and what you post, and extract da ta from your page to sell to third-party buyers.

Pamela: No, they can’t do that. I’d know if they we re doing that.

Lorenzo: How?

Pamela: Well . . .

Lorenzo: As I said, that’s happening as we speak. A nd those are the legitimate uses of your information. Hackers can gain access, too, with malicious intent. They can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.

Pamela: So, what should I do?

Lorenzo: Take down most of your posts and photos, a t least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.

Pamela: But that would mean no one would know anyth ing about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring page.

Lorenzo: It’s either risk being boring or risk an i nvasion of your privacy.

Pamela: Wow, what a dilemma!

[end of dialogue]

Lorenzo begins our dialogue by saying to Pamela, “I  wouldn’t post all of those photos on social media sites.” Notice, Lorenzo begi ns here with a conditional, “I wouldn’t” – I would not. The idea is, “If I were yo u, I would not do this.” It’s a way of giving someone advice. Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t  post” – that is, put up on a website, or upload – “all of those photos on social  media sites.”

“Social (social) media” refers to websites where pe ople share personal information, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedI n. Those are three popular social media sites now as we record this episode, a lthough that changes quite quickly on the Internet. Pamela says, “Why not? Onl y my friends and family are going to see them.” Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t be so  sure.” Once again he uses that “wouldn’t,” or “would not,” construction. He’s  saying, “If I were you, I wouldn’t be so sure.” It’s a way here of expressing doubt.

Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t post all of that personal  data either, or divulge personal information.” The word “data,” (data), which can al so be pronounced “DAY-ta,” is information; it’s information about something. “Per sonal data” would be information about your life – perhaps your birthday  or your government registration number, which here in the United State s is called your “social security number.” That’s personal data.

Strictly speaking, “data” is a plural noun, althoug h it is often used now as a singular noun. So, you should say “data are” instea d of “data is,” but the singular of data, which is “datum” (datum), is not used very  much anymore. So, we’ve sort

of lost that distinction between the singular and the plural. Lorenzo says that Pamela should not “divulge” personal information. “ To divulge” (divulge) means to share something private or secret with someone e lse – to tell someone something that you consider very personal or privat e.

Lorenzo says, “You don’t know who may gain access to your page.” “To gain (gain) access (access)” means to obtain the ability  to see something that would normally be hidden or secret. So, for example, your  email account is something that normally only you look at, but if you gave you r username and password to another person, that person could gain access to yo ur account and see all of your emails.

Pamela says, “There are privacy safeguards on this site.” “Privacy” (privacy) refers to things that are secret or hidden or priva te. The word “safeguard” (safeguard) refers to something that is supposed to  protect you or protect, in this case, information. “Privacy safeguards” would be th ings that protect your personal data, your personal information, so that no one else can see it.

Pamela says, “I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.” “To block”  (block) someone from doing something means to not allow someone to do somethin g – to prevent someone from doing something. Pamela says she can block any one from getting access to her website “so no one can see what I post without permission.” “Permission” (permission) is the right to have, see, or do somet hing. We might also use the word “authorization” or “consent” (consent).

Lorenzo says, “Well, the people who run the website  itself have access.” He’s telling Pamela that Facebook and Twitter and other social media websites can see your information – the people at the company, the people who own those websites, can see your personal information. Lorenz o says, “They could track what you do and what you post and extract data from  your page to sell to third- party buyers.” “To track” (track) means to observe something, usually over a long period of time – “to monitor,” we might also say to  express the same idea.

“To extract” (extract) something is to take somethi ng out of a larger body or to remove a part of something. If you’re going to extr act data, you are going to be taking pieces of information from a larger list of information or, in this case, from a website or web page. Of course, many websites tak e your information and use it in certain ways. The most common way would be to  sell that information to “third-party buyers.” “Third (third) – party (party )” refers to an organization or a person who is not part of, in this case, the compan y.

So, if Facebook takes your information and sells it  to another advertising company, the advertising company would be considere d a third party. The word “party” is not just a noun for a celebration like a  birthday party. It is also used in legal situations, or when we’re talking about the l aw, to refer to a person or company. There are two parties in any lawsuit. One party, one person or group, is trying to get money from another person or group . Those are the two parties involved.

Pamela says, “No, they can’t do that. I’d know if they were doing that.” Lorenzo asks, “How?” Pamela says, “Well . . .” In other wor ds, Pamela here is saying that if one of these websites takes her information, she  will know about it, but Lorenzo asks, “How?” How will you know? Then he continues, “As I said, that’s happening as we speak,” meaning right now, “and those are the  legitimate uses of your information.” “Legitimate” (legitimate) means real or allowed. Sometimes we use the word also to mean “not false” or “not fake.”

Lorenzo is saying that websites can already do this  with your information. Then he adds, “Hackers can gain access, too, with malici ous intent.” A “hacker” (hacker) is a person who uses their knowledge of co mputers to gain access to secret information on your web page or on your own computer. Hackers often have malicious intent. “Malicious” (malicious) mean s bad or evil. “Malicious intent” would be having plans to do bad things.

Lorenzo says, “They,” meaning the hackers, “can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.” Pamela then asks, “So , what should I do?” Lorenzo advises her to “take down most of your post s and photos, at least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.” “To take d own” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning in this case to delete or remove somet hing from a website.

Pamela says, “But that would mean no one would know  anything about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring pag e.” “Worse yet” is a phrase we used to emphasize that something is bad, especia lly as an example of something that is even worse than what you are talk ing about. So, if a bad thing is being described and then you want to talk about something that is even worse, you might use that expression to introduce the next  topic: “Worse yet . . .”

Pamela here is saying that if she removed all of he r posts and photos that she would have a very boring, or uninteresting, web pag e on this particular media site. Lorenzo says, “It’s either risk being boring or risk an invasion of your privacy.” Lorenzo is saying that Pamela has two cho ices: either she can have a boring page, or she can perhaps have her privacy in vaded.

An “invasion” (invasion) of your privacy is when yo ur personal information is obtained and/or used by other people, often for som ething that you would not want it used for. Many people think, for example, that if the government is listening to your cell phone conversations, that th at is an invasion of privacy. Not that any government would ever do that, right?

Pamela ends our dialogue by saying, “Wow, what a di lemma.” A “dilemma” (dilemma) is a difficult problem or situation where  the solution or the answer isn’t clear. You’re not sure what to do or how you should  make a decision about this problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Pamela: Why not? Only my friends and family are going to see them.
