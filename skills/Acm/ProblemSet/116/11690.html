<h1>Problem B - Money Matters</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Gunnar Kreitz -->


<p>
Our sad tale begins with a tight clique of friends. Together they went on a
trip to the picturesque country of Molvania. During their stay, various events
which are too horrible to mention occurred. The net result was that the last
evening of the trip ended with a momentous exchange of ``I never want to see
you again!''s. A quick calculation tells you it may have been said almost 50
million times!

<p>
Back home in Scandinavia, our group of ex-friends realize that they haven't
split the costs incurred during the trip evenly. Some people may be out
several thousand crowns. Settling the debts turns out to be a bit more
problematic than it ought to be, as many in the group no longer wish to speak
to one another, and even less to give each other money.

<p>
Naturally, you want to help out, so you ask each person to tell you how much
money she owes or is owed, and whom she is still friends with. Given this
information, you're sure you can figure out if it's possible for everyone to
get even, and with money only being given between persons who are still
friends.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<=20) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line contains two integers, <i>n</i> (<i>2 &le; n &le; 10000</i>), and <i>m</i> (<i>0 &le; m
&le; 50000</i>), the number of friends and the number of remaining friendships.
Then <i>n</i> lines follow, each containing an integer <i>o</i> (<i>-10000 &le; o
&le; 10000)</i> indicating how much each person owes (or is owed if <i>o &lt; 0</i>). The
sum of these values is zero. After this comes <i>m</i> lines giving the remaining
friendships, each line containing two integers <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> (<i>0 &le; x &lt; y &le;
n-1</i>) indicating that persons <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are still friends.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case your output should consist of a single line saying <tt>POSSIBLE</tt> or
<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.
