[start of dialogue]

Svetlana:  Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?

Quinn:  Sure, it’s not that big a deal.  I already p ut some supplies in my new backpack.

Svetlana:  Let’s see.  You have some folders, a three-rin g binder, and a pen.  Is that all you’re bringing to school?

Quinn:  I don’t have my books yet.  I’ll get those tomor row morning.  What else do I need?  I’m not in the second grade.  I don’t nee d things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.

Svetlana:  No, but you’re missing a lot of stuff.  I shou ld know.  You have a pen, but no pencils.  You have no erasers or highlighters.  You have a three-ring binder, but you don’t have any ruled paper or a noteb ook.

Quinn:  I don’t need all of that stuff on the first d ay!

Svetlana:  You want to be prepared, don’t you?  Where  are your index cards? Don’t you have a calculator?  You’ll need it for your ma th class.

Quinn:  Are you kidding me?!  If I carry all of that pl us my books, who will carry me to class?

 [end of dialogue]

Let me begin by explaining a little bit about the tit le for this episode, “Buying Back-to-School Supplies.”  We could just say, “Buying School Supplies.”  We say here “Back-to-School” to emphasize that these are child ren who went to school last year and are going to school again this year; they are what we might call “continuing students.”  Each August, all of the stores hav e Back-to-School sales, things that they are selling parents and students, things that they will need for school – new clothing for example, new school supplies, et c.

Our dialogue begins with Svetlana saying, “Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?”  “Junior high” is sometimes called “middle school.”  In the United States, we have most schools divided into “elementa ry,” which is grades one, two, three, four, five, and usually six.  We have “m iddle school,” which is typically grades seven and eight, or six, seven, and eight.   This used to be called, when I was in school, “junior high,” and in some places i t is.  Some people call it “middle school,” some people call it “junior high.”  the grades after that – 9, 10, 11, and 12 – are called “senior high.”  Every city in the  United States is a little different.  It sounds strange, but every city – every local a rea has its own school organization, but generally speaking, junior high is for  those children who are ages 12, 13, maybe 14.

Quinn says that he is ready; he says, “Sure, it’s not that b ig a deal,” meaning it’s not that important or it’s not that big of a change f or him to worry about.  He says, “I already put some supplies in my new backpack.”  “Supplie s” is a general word for things that you need to have to do something.  You  may need supplies to build a house; you’ll need supplies to run your office – you’ll need all sorts of things.  That general term is called “supplies,” thing s you use in order to accomplish another task.  A “backpack” (one word) is a thick cl oth bag; usually it has many pockets.  These are used by school children and by col lege students to carry their books and their school supplies.  They’re call ed a “backpack.”  You can also have a backpack if you are, for example, going camp ing.  You have a big bag, basically, on the back of your shoulders that you use for all of your clothing, your sleeping bag, and so forth.

Svetlana says, “Let’s see.  You have some folders, a three- ring binder, and a pen.”  A “folder” is a large piece of thick paper, like  cardboard, that is folded so that you can put papers inside of it.  A “three-ring b inder” is a large piece of plastic that looks like a book.  It has three metal rings – three circles – inside of it that you can use to put paper into, and hold paper.  I t’s called a “three-ring

 binder.”  A “pen,” you probably know, is a small tool we  use for writing.  Usually it has a liquid inside, which we call “ink” (ink).

Quinn says, “I don’t have my books yet.”  Svetlana asks him, “I s that all you’re bringing to school?” meaning are you bringing anything else, and Quinn answers, “I don’t have my books yet.  I’ll get those tomorrow morn ing.  What else do I need?”  He says, “I’m not in the second grade.”  Rememb er, he’s in junior high, so he’s in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade.  He says, “I do n’t need things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.”  These are three things t hat you might buy for a child in elementary school – a younger child.  “Glue” is a white or clear liquid that you use to make things stick together.  Children oft en use glue in making projects at school, making things – young children do.  A “ crayon” is a long piece of colored wax, basically.  It’s similar to a pen or a pen cil; it’s used by children to draw things on a piece of paper.  Finally, “construction paper” are large thick pieces of usually colored paper that children use for thin gs like their art projects at school; again, something you would find in an eleme ntary school for younger children.  The word “construction” has a couple of diff erent meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanatio ns.

Talking about crayons, there was, and still is, a maker of crayons here in the United States called Crayola (Crayola).  And this company made different sets of crayons: you had a very small set that had eight colors, the n you could get a 16- color set, and, I think, the biggest was a 64-color set.  Of course, all the children wanted to have the 64-color set; my parents just got me the eight-color set.  It’s something that I still think about, many years later!

Svetlana, whose name I’m sure I’m going to mispronounce at least once during this dialogue, says, “No (you don’t need those things), b ut you’re missing a lot of stuff (a lot of things).  I should know,” she says, meani ng I have the experience or the intelligence to know something.  “You have a pen,  but no pencils.”  A “pencil” is like a pen, except it uses something called “graphite”  instead of ink; usually it’s made of wood.  With a pencil, you can easily erase the ma rks that you make; you can get rid of them with something called an “eraser,” which is a small piece of rubber or plastic, often in the color pink here in the U.S., that’s used to remove the marks you make with your pencil.  Many pencils have an eraser on the opposite end, the end that you don’t use to write wit h.

So, Svetlana says that Quinn has no erasers or highlighter s.  A “highlighter” is a pen that has a very bright, very easy to see color, and you can take it and you can put this pen on a piece of paper to mark a certain se ction, to write over those words, but you can still see the words underneath the c olor.  The verb is “to highlight,” to put a line over the words so that peopl e will see them more easily.

 She continues, “You have a three-ring binder, but you d on’t have any ruled paper or a notebook.”  “Ruled paper” (ruled) is paper that has “horizontal” lines, from side to side, that indicate where you should write.  Rul ed paper is used in many – perhaps most schools to help children and adults to write more clearly.  A “notebook” is a small book of paper that you can write  on.  It’s blank; that is it doesn’t have anything on it other than the lines usually.   In a notebook, you can take a page out one at a time, and the rest of the p ages stay in the notebook.

Quinn say, “I don’t need all of that stuff on the first  day!”  His friend says, “You want to be prepared, don’t you?  Where are your inde x cards?”  An “index card” is a small piece of thick paper, usually three inches by five inches, and it has blue lines on it.  It’s white paper with blue lines that you  use to write down pieces of information on.  They’re useful in that you can organize  your index cards if you are taking notes on a particular subject.  This is what te achers always tell their students to do, although I never, myself, actually used ind ex cards that way, and I don’t know anyone who did.  Some students use index card s to try to memorize things, to study certain facts for example.  This is usually a pretty inefficient way of learning something for the long-term, but it will  help you pass the test.

She also says, “Don’t you have a calculator?”  A “calculator”  is a small electronic machine that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, does oth er mathematical operations.  “You’ll need it for your math class,” she sa ys.

Quinn says, “Are you kidding me?!” meaning “are you joking  with me?”  “If I carry all of that plus (or in addition to) my books, who will  carry me  to class?” suggesting that that’s too much, that it’s so heavy that he  won’t be able to carry it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Svetlana:  Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?

Quinn:  Sure, it’s not that big a deal.  I already p ut some supplies in my new backpack.

Quinn:  Are you kidding me?!  If I carry all of that pl us my books, who will carry me to class?
