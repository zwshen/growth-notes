Today’s podcast is going to be about someone moving  from one house or one apartment to another house or apartment. Let’s go! 

[start of dialogue] 

Edmundo: What are you doing? 

Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of  the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is fini shing his degree at the university. 

Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are yo u using a moving company? 

Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm  putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he gr aduates. 

Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your  mail?  

Ruth: Thanks for the offer. I've submitted a change -of-address form to the post office so I hope my mail will get forwarded automat ically. One thing I have to remember to do is to shut off the utilities: gas, e lectricity, and phone‚ but I'll have two more weeks to do that. 

Edmundo: Well, good luck in Vancouver. I don't envy  you. I hate moving. Let me know if you need any help with those boxes. 

Ruth: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

We’re talking about someone who needs to move from one house or apartment or one city to another city. In this dialogue, we b egin with Edmundo saying, “What are you doing?” And Ruth, his friend, says, “ Oh, I’m packing.” “I’m packing” (packing). “To pack” means to put things i n a box or in a suitcase – in a bag – so that you can take them somewhere else. If you are going on a trip, you pack a bag or a suitcase. If you are moving, you ha ve to pack everything in your house, put things in boxes and in bags to move them .  

So, Ruth says she’s packing because her “lease is u p” at the end of the month. A “lease” (lease) is a contract. It’s a legal agreeme nt when you rent an apartment or a house; you have to sign a contract. We call th at contract a “lease.” When you rent a house or an apartment or a car, anything  that you are going to use, you have this lease. So, you sign a lease. When the  lease is over, when your contract is over, we say that your “lease is up.” “ Your lease is up.” It’s just an idiom that we have. So, Ruth’s lease is up at the e nd of the month and we learnt that she is moving to Vancouver. 

Well, Edmundo says, “Wow” (wow) – is an expression of surprise or when something is really amazing to you. Unusually , you  might say, “Wow.” Edmundo says, “Wow, are you moving yourself or are you usin g a moving company?” Well, “to move yourself” would mean you would put everyth ing in your own car and drive there. To use a moving company is a company w ith a big truck that comes and people put your things into the truck and the t ruck drives to your new house – your new apartment - and they “unpack.” Notice th e opposite of pack is to “unpack” (unpack) – all one word. So, they take you r things and they put them into your new house. Actually, to unpack means to t ake things out of the boxes – just moving the boxes into your house – your new ho use is not the same as “unpacking,” technically. Although there are some c ompanies that if you pay them enough money, they’ll pack and unpack your hou se.  

Well, Ruth says that she is going to move herself. She’s doing it by herself and she’s renting a “U-Haul.” Well, “U-Haul” is the nam e of a company that rents trucks to individual people so they can use their b ig trucks for moving. It’s just one company, but it’s a very company  in the entire  United States. So, when someone says they’re renting a “U-Haul” – and I sho uld explain U-Haul is spelled (U) – the capital (U)-(HAUL). “To haul” (haul) is s imilar to move. The verb “to haul” means to move. So, “U-Haul” means you are goi ng to move. You are going to haul your things. So, someone says, “I’m renting  a U-Haul” – they mean a truck from the company called “U-Haul.”  

 Ruth says she’s putting some of her furniture, her chairs, her tables, her couch, – couch is the same as a sofa – in “storage.” When we  say, “I’m going to put something in storage” (storage) they mean that you are going to rent a place that will keep your things for however long you want the m to. You have to pay them. So, you have a little space where you can put all o f your things and there are many companies that have big buildings where you ca n rent a little part of the space – very popular in Los Angeles. And this is ca lled “storage.”  

So, she’s putting some of her things in storage and  when she moves back to whatever city she is in, she will then take it out of storage and be able to use it again. Edmundo offers to help Ruth. “Can I help?” h e says. “Do you need me to forward your mail?” “To forward” (forward) – as a v erb – “to forward” – means that something – you get a letter. It comes to you and you forward it to someone else. So, you mail it again to someone else. In the  United States, there is just one government – semi-government, partially government supported company that delivers regular mail – the United States Postal Se rvice. There are many private companies which will also deliver letters, packages , boxes – companies like Federal Express or, another very popular one is cal led “UPS” – United Postal Service. Those are private companies. But for your regular mail – for your bills, for the letters, normal letters, you use the govern ment sponsored United States Postal Service. People usually just call it the “po st-office.” Well, if you are going to move, you need to tell the post-office where you r new address is and they will forward your mail. So, instead of sending it to you r old address, they will send it to your new address – this is called “forwarding” y our mail. 

Ruth says to Edmundo, “Thanks for the offer,” meani ng thank you for asking me to help. She says, “I’ve submitted a change of addr ess form to the post office.” A “change of address form” (form) is just a little ca rd that says, “Hey, I’m moving. Please send my mail to this new address.” And if yo u are going to move in the United States, you usually have to send that card a t least a couple of weeks before. Some post offices, some places, it can be a  shorter time. But it’s safer to send it early. And then you tell them, “Beginning o n this day, I want my mail forwarded. “ Well, this is a change of address form  and she submitted (submitted) – means she gave, in this case, she sub mitted the form to the post- office – her local post-office – the post office wh ere she lives right now. And she, therefore, says that her mail will get forwarded au tomatically, so that she doesn’t have to do anything special.  

She says, “One thing I have to remember is to shut off the utilities.” “Utilities” (utilities) are the gas, the electricity, the water , your phone – these are all your utilities at a house or an apartment. “To shut off the utilities” means to turn off.  

But we use that special verb “to shut off” especial ly for gas, electricity and water. So, you shut off your utilities, you stop them. So,  you tell the gas company, “I’m leaving.” You tell the phone company, “I want you t o get rid of this number.” So, you cancel or shut off all of these different thing s and you have to do that before you move. 

Well, Edmundo wishes Ruth good luck in Vancouver. S he’s moving to the city of Vancouver in Canada. He says, “I don’t envy you. I hate moving.” “To envy” (envy) means the same as to be jealous. I want what  you have. You, for example, you buy a new car – a nice car. And I want  your car. I “envy you,” meaning I want to have what you have. But Edmundo s ays, “I don’t envy you,” meaning it’s not a very pleasant good thing to have  to move. But he tells her, “Let me know if you need any help.” “Let me know” means tell me if you need any help. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
