[start of dialogue]

Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?

Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and  this is a thriller.

Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless acti on movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.

Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you o n the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.

Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those al ready, too.

Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a li fe-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.

Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action m ovie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the ad renaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.

Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action  film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?

Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent f ight scene is over.

Claude begins the dialogue by saying, “Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?” An “action (action) movie” is a movie that has  usually a lot of fighting, a lot of car chases, often a lot of violence. Action movies have a hero – a good guy – and then one or more bad guys that the good guy, of  course, fights. Jean says, “Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this  is a thriller.” A “thriller” (thriller) is also an exciting movie, but instead of having a lot  of fights or violence, it involves a lot of surprise or even fear.

Now, sometimes there can be violence in a thriller as well, but a thriller would be a movie during which you are waiting to see what wi ll happen. You’re going to be surprised at what happens. In an action movie, you’ re often not surprised at what happens. You kind of know what’s going to happen – the good guy is going to win. But in a thriller, there’s more of what we wou ld call “suspense” (suspense) – when you don’t know what’s going to happen.

Claude says, “This definitely seems like a brainles s action movie to me.” “Brainless” means that it isn’t very smart. It isn’ t very intelligent. Your “brain” (brain), of course, is what’s in your head, or at l east what’s in most people’s heads. I’m not quite sure about my neighbor. “Brain less” (less) would be someone who didn’t have a brain, or not a very big brain. The term “brainless” is an insulting one to describe something you think is  stupid or not very intelligent. Claude says that this is “a brainless action movie”  that Jean is watching.

He says, “That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.” A “fight scene” (scene) is a part of a movie where,  of course, people are fighting. When we talk about “scenes” in a movie, we’re talki ng about different parts or sections of the movie with the same characters or p eople in the same place. Claude says, “This is the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film,” meaning we’ve only been watching the movie f or 15 minutes.

Jean says, “It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep  you on the edge of your seat.” When we say something keeps you “on the edge (edge)  of your seat,” we mean that there’s a lot of excitement, a lot of suspense , a lot of anticipation. Everyone is eager or very much interested in finding out wha t’s going to happen next. A thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you ’re sitting on a chair on the edge of your seat – “seat” is another word for chair – y ou are just about to get up or you are leaning forward towards the front of the ch air. If you’re relaxed, you would be sitting back against the back of the chair .

Jean says, “Of course it’ll have some fight scenes, ” meaning the movie will have some fight scenes even though it is a thriller. Cla ude doesn’t seem to agree with Jean. He says, “And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.” A “car

chase” (chase) is when one car tries to catch anoth er car, both of them usually going very fast. Action movies typically have lots of car chases in them. Claude is saying that this isn’t really a thriller because it  has all of the elements, or parts, of an action movie, such as car chases.

Jean disagrees. She says, “Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life- threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pu rsuit.” A “hero” (hero) is a good guy – the person, man or woman, who is the main cha racter of the movie and is the one that is going to beat, or defeat, the bad g uys. If you’re in a “life- threatening situation,” you’re in a situation where  you could die. And of course, in movies that is often the case.

The hero always fights against a “villain” (villain ). A villain is a bad guy in the movie, the opposite of the hero. Jean calls him “th e evil villain,” but villains are always evil. “Evil” just means bad. Jean says that this movie has “a hero in a life- threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pu rsuit.” The word “pursuit” (pursuit) comes from the verb “to pursue” (pursue). “To pursu e” means to run after or chase after someone – to try to catch someone who i s escaping from you or who is trying to get away from you.

“To pursue” can also mean simply to go on a certain  path to try to obtain some goal. We talk about students “pursuing” a degree in  history. They are trying to get a degree in history. Just like me. What do you do w ith a degree in history? Well, you become a podcaster. Anyway, back to the dialogu e. We have a villain in  hot pursuit. If you say someo ne is “in hot pursuit” of another person, the person is chasing someone very closely,  almost catching him or her. Claude says, “That sounds like a run-of-the-mill ac tion movie to me.” “Run-of-the- mill” is an expression that means ordinary – not ve ry interesting, not unusual. It’s usually used as a way of describing something that isn’t special in any way. It’s just like perhaps a thousand other types of that th ing. “This is a run-of-the-mill microphone.” It’s not a great microphone. It’s an a verage microphone. There’s nothing special about it.

Claude says, “This movie is full of visual effects and stunts.” “Visual” (visual) refers to something you can see. In movies, when we  talk about “visual effects” (effects), we’re talking about things that usually involve using computers or some sort of trick with the camera to make something loo k real when it isn’t, when it isn’t actually there.

“Special effects” are often used to show buildings blowing up or planes crashing to the ground, even though the people who made the movie didn’t actually blow up or destroy a building. They use often, computer software nowadays, or other

special tricks to make it look as though that were happening. “Stunts” (stunts) are dangerous actions that one of the characters in the  movie performs.

Here in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, there are p eople who are what are called “stuntmen” or “stuntwomen,” and they go in a nd do these dangerous actions so that the actor or actress doesn’t have t o. Some actors and actresses, however, like to do their own stunts, meaning they don’t like to have a stunt person doing the dangerous actions in the movie; th ey like to do their own stunts.

Claude says that this movie is “all about the adren aline rush.” When we talk about someone having an “adrenaline (adrenaline) ru sh (rush),” we’re talking about someone who has a sudden feeling of excitemen t, a sudden feeling of extra energy, often in response to stress or danger . Adrenaline is a chemical, a hormone in your body that is released when you are in a dangerous situation, often.

Claude says, “It’s not what I call a psychological thriller.” A “psychological thriller” is a thriller that focuses on the emotions, thought s, and ideas of the main character in order to create this suspense, this an xiety. Think of the movies of Alfred Hitchcock, the great English director of the  twentieth century. He created a lot of interesting psychological thrillers.

Jean says, “Maybe it,” meaning the movie, “straddle s the line between an action film and a thriller.” “To straddle (straddle) the l ine” means to have characteristics of two different things, so that you can’t really t ell what it is. Is it one thing or is it another thing? That’s what Jean is saying about thi s movie. It’s both a thriller and an action movie.

She asks Claude if the movie is good. Claude replie s, “I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.” We already know  what a fight scene is. If you describe a fight scene as “ultra-violent,” you mean  it is very violent. The term “ultra” (ultra) is sometimes added in front of a wo rd to mean it has a lot of something. It’s a way of saying it is very much thi s thing. So, if we say something is “ultra-violent,” we mean that it is really viole nt or very violent.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action  film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?

Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent f ight scene is over.

Our scripts don’t have a lot of ultra-violent fight  scenes in them, but we think they’re pretty interesting all the same. Thanks to Dr. Lucy Tse for writing them.
