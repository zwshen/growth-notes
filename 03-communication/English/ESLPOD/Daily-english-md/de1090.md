[start of dialogue]

Robert: These designs are really futuristic-looking .

Mara: I’m trying to be forward-thinking and imagine  what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.

Robert: You think that the world will be filled wit h space-age gadgets like these?

Mara: That’s the natural evolution of technology for the next 100 years, I think. We will continue to develop labor-saving devices, s impler ways of doing everyday tasks, and to improve artificial intellige nce.

Robert: I’m not sure I want to live in a world that  looks like that. It seems so cold and impersonal.

Mara: That’s only because most of us have a fear of  the unknown.

Robert: That’s me in a nutshell. I’d rather return to a simpler way of life with as little innovation and technology as possible.

Mara: Like modern sanitation and transportation?

Robert: Well, I want to go back in time with some t hings, but keep my conveniences.

Mara: So you want to pick and choose? That shouldn’ t be a problem when we figure out time travel.

Robert begins the dialogue by saying to Mara, “Thes e designs are really futuristic-looking.” The word “futuristic” (futuris tic) comes from the word “future,” meaning something that is not present or past in ti me. There’s really only one other possibility, and that would be something that  hasn’t yet happened, or the future. So “futuristic” means very forward-looking,  very modern – something that looks like, well, something from the future, even t hough that’s not technically possible.

Mara says, “I’m trying to be forward-thinking and i magine what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.” “To be forward-thinking” means to be thinking about the future, planning for the future. Robert says, “You think that the world will be filled with space-age gadgets like these?” “Gadgets” (gadg ets) are small machines or devices or tools that do something interesting, tha t do something different, some form of technology.

“Space-age” is a term you don’t hear as much now as  you did maybe in the 1960s and ’70s. “Space-age” refers to the period of  time when man is now able to go out into outer space – the area outside of ou r own world. So, “space-age” refers really to the modern era, or the modern peri od.

Mara says, “That’s the natural evolution of technol ogy for the next 100 years, I think.” “Technology” refers to the application of s cience in finding practical solutions to things, or simply the creativity of the person who makes a certain thing. “Technology” could refer to lots of differen t things, but basically to tools or things we use to accomplish something. Nowadays whe n you say “technology,” people usually think of computer technology.

“Evolution” is the process of change over a period of time, usually a long period of time. In biology, the “theory of evolution” is a ssociated with the British scientist of the nineteenth century, Charles Darwin. But here  we’re talking not about evolution of human beings, but technological evolut ion – the changing technology.

Mara continues, “We will continue to develop labor- saving devices to find simpler ways of doing everyday tasks and to improve artific ial intelligence.” A “labor (labor) – saving device” is some tool or device or machine that saves you work. “Labor-saving” refers to the time and energy you ne ed in order to accomplish something, to do something. So for example, email i n many ways is a labor- saving device. You don’t have to go to the post off ice and mail a letter. You can

just do it from your own home, or wherever you are if you have a phone with email.

Mara says also in the future, we will continue “to improve artificial intelligence.” “Artificial intelligence” is the idea that a comput er is able to use information in order to make decisions – to act as if it were like  a human being. I won’t get into the philosophical problems with that definition or that line of thinking, but usually, in computing, we’re talking about the ability of the computer to learn certain rules and apply those rules according to the programming of the computer.

Robert says, “I’m not sure I want to live in a worl d that looks like that. It seems so cold and impersonal.” Something that is “impersonal ” (impersonal) is something that you are not close to – something or some perso n that you don’t have a lot of feelings for or emotion towards. Robert is talking about a world that is “cold and impersonal.” He means a world in which there isn’t a lot of human feeling, perhaps even human interaction. That would be certa inly “impersonal.”

Mara says, “That’s only because most of us have a f ear of the unknown.” A “fear (fear) of the unknown” is when you are afraid of or  scared of things that you don’t understand, that you don’t know about. Now, of cour se, I think most of us have a fear of the unknown. It could be good. It could be bad. But if you don’t know what it is, you at the very least might want to be a lit tle cautious.

Mara is saying that the reason Robert doesn’t like Mara’s vision of the future is that he has a fear of the unknown. This is also a c ommon way of dismissing or countering someone’s argument – by saying that they  have some serious psychological problem. This is quite common in poli tics as well as in personal relations, but back to the story. Robert says, “Tha t’s me in a nutshell.” The expression “in a nutshell” (nutshell) means in a ve ry short form, in a very brief summary. Instead of giving someone a long explanati on, you give them just the essential facts or the essential information.

I read somewhere recently that this expression actu ally comes from a comment made by the Roman author Pliny the Elder about how he had heard that there was a copy of Homer’s great poems The Iliad  and The Odyssey  that were written so small, on such a small piece of paper, that they  could all be fit inside of a nutshell. That seems impossible to me, but that’s a t least one theory about where this expression “in a nutshell” comes from. It mean s in very precise terms, in the fewest number of words possible to express an idea.

Robert says, “I’d rather return to a simpler way of  life with as little innovation and technology as possible.” A “simpler way of life” wo uld be a less complicated way

of living, with less distractions. “Innovation” (in novation) refers to inventing new things or creating new technology. The verb is “to innovate.” “Novus” (novus) is the Latin word for “new” and that’s where we get th is term, ultimately, from. Robert wants a simpler way of life with as little i nnovation as possible.

Mara says, “Like modern sanitation and transportati on?” Mara is asking Robert if he wants to live in a world where you don’t even ha ve modern transportation like cars and airplanes, or modern “sanitation” (sanitat ion). “Sanitation” refers to cleanliness. We might also use the word “hygiene” ( hygiene). That would refer to your personal cleanliness – taking showers and brus hing your teeth, having bathrooms that operate in an efficient way. This is  all part of sanitation.

Roberts says, “Well, I want to go back in time with  some things, but keep my conveniences.” “To go back in time” would be imposs ible, of course. It means to return to an earlier time, before the time in which  you are now living. “Conveniences” refers to things that make your life  easier – things like, say, Google, or a car, or the ability to download podcas ts and listen to them on your way to work. These are all modern conveniences – in  some cases, quite recent conveniences.

Mara says, “So, you want to pick and choose?” meani ng you want to pick the things or select the things that you want to keep a nd those that you don’t. She says, “That shouldn’t be a problem when we figure o ut time travel.” “Time travel” is the idea that you are able to travel either forw ard or backwards in time. This is just a theoretical ability. I’m not sure if most sc ientists think it would ever be possible, but there are some that do.

There’s a popular British television show that’s be en on for years and years called Doctor Who . Doctor Who is a time traveler. He goes back and f orth in time in his little machine. I used to watch that show wh en I was in high school back in the 1970s. It’s a British sci-fi, or science fictio n show. But Mara of course is joking. She doesn’t think that we will figure out o r be able to understand time travel, at least not soon enough to benefit Robert.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
