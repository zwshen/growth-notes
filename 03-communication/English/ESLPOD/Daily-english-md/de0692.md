This episode is called “Recommending Someone for a Job.”  It’s a dialogue between Harry and Judy.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Harry:  I’ve put in a good word for you with my bos s.  He said to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.

Judy:  Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00.

Harry:  Not around 4:00.  You need to be there at 4 :00 sharp, got that?  I’m sticking my neck out for you by recommending you for this job, so don’t let me down.

Judy:  All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not like it’ s my idea to get a job at your store.  I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.  I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.

Harry:  You can’t afford to be choosy.  You need a job and you need it right now.

Judy:  I’m not in a hurry.  I want to find a job th at really suits my talents.

Harry:  I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch and mo oching off me.  By the time you find a job that suits your talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Harry saying, “I’ve put in  a good word for you with my boss.”  The expression “to put in a good word for ( someone)” means to say

something good about another person to a possible e mployer or someone who you are looking for a favor from or to get somethin g from.  More generally, it means to recommend someone for an opportunity or a position – “to put in a good word for someone.”  “I will put in a good word  for you with Dr. Lucy Tse, and maybe in our Café we’ll answer your question.”  “I’ll put in a good word for you.”  Harry says that his boss had to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.  “To stop by” is a phras al verb meaning to go somewhere for a short period of time.  “Tomorrow, I  will stop by your house and have a cup of coffee,” I won’t be there for hours a nd hours, just a short amount of time.  Harry’s boss is going to stop by the store –  we guess that Harry and Judy work in a store, or that at least Harry does – and the boss will “interview” Judy. He will have a formal meeting where he will ask que stions to see if she is a good person for this job.

Judy says, “Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00 .”  When someone says “around 4:00” they mean approximately; maybe a few minutes before, maybe a few minutes after.  Harry says, however, “Not aroun d 4:00.  You need to be here at 4:00 sharp, got that?”  “Sharp” is here used to mean exactly, precisely, at a specific time.  So when we’re talking about time, a nd you want to give someone an exact time, you might say, “I want you to leave at 8:45 sharp.”  That means exactly at 8:45, not before, not after.  Another wa y of saying this would be “on the dot.”  “I want you here by 8:00 on the dot.”  That’ s exactly at 8:00.

Harry says, “I’m sticking my neck out for you.”  “T o stick your neck out for (someone)” means to take a risk, to perhaps say som ething or do something that could hurt you but it could also help you or, in th is case, help someone else.  “I’m going to stick my neck out for my brother and say t hat he will be here at 8:00.”  If he isn’t here at 8:00 I might be in trouble, but I am going to take a risk; I’m going to stick my neck out for him.  In general, you can use the expression not for “him,” but for yourself; you can just say, “I’m going to stick my neck and say that the capital of Spain is Madrid.”  You’re saying I m ight be wrong; I’m taking a risk. If I’m wrong, I’m sure several thousand Spaniards w ill email me, so I’m sticking my neck out.  Actually, I’m pretty sure Madrid is t he capital of Spain!

So, Harry is sticking his neck out for Judy.  How i s he doing that?  By recommending her for the job.  “To recommend,” of c ourse, means to say something that someone should do or not do based on  or coming from your own opinions, knowledge, or experiences.  Harry is stic king his neck out for Judy by recommending her for the job.  “So,” he says, “don’ t let me down.”  “To let (someone) down,” or “to let down (someone),” is ano ther phrasal verb meaning to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s expect ations.

Judy says, “All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not lik e it’s my idea to get a job at your store.”  Notice that she introduces this sentence b y saying “It’s not like.”  That means that what you are saying is the opposite of w hat you think is true or you know to be true.  “It’s not like it’s my idea to ge t a job at your store” means it is not Judy’s idea to get a job at Harry’s store.  She  says, “I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.”  “To put your reputat ion on the line” means to put your reputation at risk, to do something or say som ething that might change the way people think about you.  “Reputation” is what o ther people think about you, their opinions of you.  Judy says that she didn’t a sk Harry to put his reputation on the line by recommending her.  She says, in fact, “ I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.”  “To be a good fit” (fit) means to be a good match, when something is comfortable or convenient, when two people or a per son and a situation seem to be matched for each other.  “I like big cities, so living in Los Angeles is a good fit for me,” meaning I will be comfortable or happy bec ause I like big cities, and Los Angeles is a big city.

Harry says to Judy, “You can’t afford to be choosy. ”  “To afford (afford) to do (something)” means to be able to do something becau se it does not present any problems for you.  It could also mean to have enoug h money to do something: “I can’t afford to go to Las Vegas this weekend; I don ’t have any money to lose.” “To afford to” can also mean something without mone y, and that’s the case in this example.  Harry says to Judy, “You can’t affor d to be choosy (choosy).”  “To be choosy” means to be willing to take or have only  the things that meet your very high standards or high expectations.  Another word for this is “picky” (picky). Someone who is “choosy” doesn’t take the first thin g they see, they wait until they get the best thing – the “best fit,” you could  say, for their situation.  Some men and women don’t get married as early as they us ed to nowadays; some people say that’s because they’re being too choosy – too picky, waiting for the perfect man or the perfect woman rather than someon e they could grow to love. That’s some people’s opinion; not mine necessarily.

Harry says that Judy can’t afford to be choosy.  “You need a job and you need it right now.”  Judy says, “I’m not in a hurry.  I wan t to find a job that really suits my talents.”  “To suit (suit) your talents” means to make good use of your strengths and interests, to be something that matches your qu alifications, what you are able to do.

Harry says, “I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch a nd mooching off me.”  Now we understand why Harry wants Judy to get a job.  J udy is staying at Harry’s apartment, and he says she is mooching off him.  “T o mooch (mooch) off (someone)” is an informal expression meaning to tak e things for free from another person, especially money, food, clothing, a nd not offering to pay them

anything.  Judy is mooching off Harry by staying at  his apartment and not paying any money.

He says, “By the time you find a job that suits you r talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!”  Harry is saying that Judy is taking a long time to find a job, and if she waits until she finds the pe rfect job, one that suits her talents, Harry will be in a nursing home.  A “nursi ng home” is a place where typically old people go because they have medical p roblems and they need a lot of extra care and help from doctors and nurses.  It ’s not a hospital; it’s a place where people live for a long time when they need ex tra help, especially medical help.  An “insane asylum” is also called a “mental institution.”  It’s a place where people who have mental problems or psychological pr oblems go; it’s where crazy people go, to put it another way.  There are lots of informal ways of talking about an insane asylum.  Harry is suggesting that he will  go crazy if he waits for Judy to find a job that suits her talents.  So, he is press uring her; he is trying to make her get a job so she can go somewhere else to live.  I don’t blame Harry!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Harry:  I’ve put in a good word for you with my bos s.  He said to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.

Judy:  Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00.

Harry:  Not around 4:00.  You need to be there at 4 :00 sharp, got that?  I’m sticking my neck out for you by recommending you for this job, so don’t let me down.

Judy:  All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not like it’ s my idea to get a job at your store.  I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.  I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.

Harry:  You can’t afford to be choosy.  You need a job and you need it right now.

Judy:  I’m not in a hurry.  I want to find a job th at really suits my talents.

Harry:  I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch and mo oching off me.  By the time you find a job that suits your talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!
