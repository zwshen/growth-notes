This dialogue is about trying to raise money – trying to get money – for some activity at your school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Valerie: What’s this?

A.J.: It’s a note from Rachel’s school. It’s about the next fundraiser.

Valerie: Oh no, not another one. What is it this ti me – a raffle, car wash, or spaghetti dinner?

A.J.: It’s none of those things. It’s a combination  bake sale and craft sale. Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and hand made items.

Valerie: This is crazy. Every month there’s somethi ng else. Last month, it was a candy sale. I had to hit up everybody at work, and that’s on the tail of raffle tickets the month before. It’s like this every year .

A.J.: I know. We already donated a lot of things to  the rummage sale last semester and gift certificates for the silent aucti on two months ago. With two kids in two different schools, I feel like we never get a breather.

Valerie: I know, and there’s more. Brian’s school is asking parents to buy a brick that will be part of a new school building and our names will be engraved on it.

A.J.: You’re kidding, right? One more fundraiser an d my name will get engraved, all right – on my tombstone!

Valerie begins our dialogue by saying to A.J., “Wha t’s this?” A.J. says, “It’s a note from Rachel’s school.” A “note” here means a piece of paper with information on it. Schools often send information back to parents,  or at least they used to, by giving the students pieces of paper that the studen ts would then deliver to the parents. Nowadays, I guess they could just email the information. A.J. says this note is “about the next fund raiser.” A “fundraiser ” (fundraiser) is an event organized by some organization to make money.

One of the things that surprises people about Ameri can schools when they come here is that even though our public schools are fre e, the schools often have activities, events, in order to make more money for  special programs for the students of the school. For example, if you have a football team or musical group that you want your students to participate in, the government may not give the school enough money for the school to organize that . So, the parents have fundraisers where they try to get money by doing a variety of different things.

Valerie talks about some of those things in her rep ly to A.J. She says, “Oh no, not another one,” meaning not another fund raiser. “What is it this time – a raffle, carwash, or spaghetti dinner?” Valerie lists three popular ways that schools and other organizations try to get money. A “raffle” (r affle) is basically a lottery. It’s an arrangement where people by tickets with the chance  of winning one or more prizes, such as money or an iPod or sometimes even a car. That’s a “raffle.”

A “car wash” is an event where a group of people, u sually students or young adults, get together and they wash people’s cars in  order to get money for their group. We used to do this when I was growing up. the school I went to would sometimes have car washes, where the students would  go and wash people’s cars for five dollars or seven dollars – I don’t re member how much – and they would give that money then to the group so that the  group would have money to do whatever it is they wanted to do.

“Spaghetti dinners” were also very popular when I w as growing up. Spaghetti dinners are when usually a group of students prepar es food for people to eat, and then people pay, of course, to get the spaghett i dinner. Spaghetti was popular because it was easy and somewhat inexpensiv e to make. A.J. says this fundraiser is not a raffle, not a car wash, or a sp aghetti dinner. He says, “It’s none of those things.” He says, “It’s a combination  bake sale and craft sale.” These are two other popular fundraisers that are us ed by schools. A “bake sale” is when different people bake cakes and cookies and  other sweets, and sell them.

 A “craft (craft) sale” is where people make things – not things you eat, but things like ornaments or decorations for your house. Peopl e make these things, and then the group sells them and keeps the money, of c ourse, from the sale. “Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and han dmade items,” according to A.J. “To donate” (donate) means to give to a per son or group without expecting anything back. When you donate money or d onate things to a group, you give them to the person or the group. A.J. is s aying that the parents are supposed to donate things for the bake sale and for  the craft sale.

Valerie says, “This is crazy,” meaning she doesn’t like this idea. “Every month there’s something else. Last month it was a candy s ale.” A “candy sale” is when a school or organization buys candy from a company and then sells that candy at a higher price. It of course keeps the difference b etween the money it spent to buy the candy and the money it got selling the cand y. Once again, this is something we did at our school when I was going to high school and grade school. We had candy sales every year where we had to go out and sell these chocolate candies by going around and asking people  to buy them.

Valerie says that she “had to hit up everybody at w ork.” “To hit up” is a phrasal verb which here means to ask someone for money – in  this case, to ask someone to buy the candy bars. Parents often help their children sell this candy by asking their friends at work to buy the candy. I ’ve done that many times in the places where I’ve worked.

Valerie says that these sales are “on the tail of r affle tickets the month before.” Something that is “on the tail (tail) of” something  means it comes immediately after that. Dogs and other animals have tails – lit tle parts of their bodies that go off the end of their body, the back of their body. That’s what “tail” means. It means the end of something. Valerie says, “It’s lik e this every year,” meaning every year they have all of these different fundrai sers.

A.J. says, “I know. We already donated a lot of thi ngs to the rummage sale last semester.” A “rummage (rummage) sale” is similar to  a “garage sale” or a “yard sale,” but is typically held by a group, usually in  a large auditorium or in a large area outside of, in this case, the school. A rummag e sale is when people donate things they no longer want any more, and the organi zation takes those things and sells them to other people. Usually it takes pl ace on one day, or over a two- day period. Many schools and other religious organi zations have rummage sales in order to make money for their group.

A.J. also says that he and Valerie donated gift cer tificates for the silent auction two months ago. A “gift certificate” is usually a p iece of paper you buy that allows you to spend a certain amount of money at a store. Nowadays, it’s much more common to have gift cards, which are like little cr edit cards but are used only for one particular store and have a certain amount of m oney on them. A “silent auction” (auction) is an event where people write their name on a list to show how much money they’re willing to pay for something .

An “auction” is normally when things are sold to the person that will give the highest price. There isn’t one set, or fixed, price . A “silent auction” is the same concept, except you don’t have somebody standing up  and trying to sell it in front of a group of people; rather, you have a list next to each thing that’s being sold, and you go around and you put down the price you’re  willing to pay. We would call that price, in an auction, your “bid” (bid).

A.J. says, “With two kids in two different schools,  I feel like we never get a breather.” A.J. and Valerie have two children, and they are attending, or going to, two different schools. Each school will have its ow n fundraisers. That means a lot of fundraisers for A.J. and Valerie. That’s what A. J. is talking about when he says, “I feel like we never get a breather” (breath er). A “breather” is a time to breathe, literally, but it means here a break, a pe riod of time when you can rest.

Valerie says, “I know, and there’s more. Brian’s sc hool is asking parents to buy a brick that will be part of a new school building an d our names will be engraved on it.” When an organization is building a new buildin g, they’ll often try to raise money for that building by selling bricks, and thes e are bricks that will go into the wall, that will have the person who gave the money’ s name on it. The name will be “engraved” (engraved) on the brick.

“To engrave” means to use a special tool that puts writing on typically a piece of metal, although we also use that verb when talking about putting words in stone or on a very hard surface like a brick. I actually used to work, when I was in high school and in college, at a place that did engravin g, so I would put people’s names on cups – on silver cups or on other signs th at they would put on their door, for example. That’s “engraving.”

Schools and other organizations try to raise money for new buildings by selling bricks for 500 dollars or a thousand dollars. You c an’t just bring a brick and give it to the school and say, “Well, here’s my brick.” You ’re not buying the brick, of course. You’re just donating money, and this is a w ay of recognizing your donation. A.J. says, “You’re kidding, right?” meani ng you’re joking, aren’t you? But, of course, Valerie is not joking.

 “One more fundraiser and my name will get engraved,  all right – on my tombstone!” Your “tombstone” (tombstone) is a large  stone that is placed above where you are buried when you die. We call that pla ce where they put your body a “grave” (grave). Traditionally, tombstones on gra ves have the person’s name, the year they were born and the year they died, som etimes the actual date of their birth and death, and possibly a short message .

A.J. is joking, of course. He’s saying that there a re so many fundraisers that they are going to kill him with all this extra work. Tha t’s why he says, “One more fundraiser” – meaning if I have to participate in o ne more fundraiser – “and my name will get engraved, all right – on my tombstone !” “All right” here means for sure, or definitely.

Of course, that could be another fundraiser. School s could sell tombstones, and you could have your name engraved on it and just le ave the date of your death blank. You wouldn’t fill that in until you actually  died. I’m just kidding, of course.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

“The Greatest Scriptwriter on the Internet” – that’ s what I think they should put on Lucy Tse’s tombstone one day (one day very, very fa r away, of course).
