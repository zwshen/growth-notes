[start of dialogue]

Eric:  Let’s get a move on or we’ll be late – again !

Carmen:  Hold your horses.  I’m on the verge of bei ng ready.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.

Eric:  A day?  I’d settle for a week.  Why is it th at every time we have someplace to be you’re always running late?

Carmen:  That’s because I march to the beat of a di fferent drummer.  Life isn’t about watching the clock; it’s about living in the moment.

Eric:  Okay, at this very moment, we’re late.

Carmen:  Just give me a couple of minutes more and I’ll be ready.  After all, none of our friends expect us to be punctual anymore.  T hey all know better.

Eric:  Yeah, and I should, too.  From now on, I’ll start getting ready when you say you’re all set.  Then I’ll just have minutes to wai t – not hours!

Eric starts off, or begins our dialogue by saying to Carmen, “Let’s get a move on or we’ll be late – again!”  “To get a move on” mean s to hurry, to rush, to do something quickly.  “We better get a move on or we will be late for dinner with our friends.”  Eric says to Carmen hurry up, basica lly.

Carmen says, “Hold your horses.”  “To hold your hor ses” is an old expression meaning to wait, to be patient, to stop rushing or hurrying another person, probably because horses, when they are scared espec ially, sometimes go very fast, you have to control them.  Well, Carmen is te lling Eric to hold his horses, meaning stop rushing her, stop trying to make her g o faster than she is.  She says, “I’m on the verge of being ready.”  “To be on  the verge (verge) of (something)” means almost, very soon, it’s just abo ut to happen.  Because “of” is a preposition the word that comes after it, if it’s  a verb, has to be changed into what’s called a gerund, making it the object of the  preposition as a noun.  So, you notice Carmen says, “I’m on the verge of being (bei ng) ready,” “being” is a gerund.  You could say, “I’m on the verge of going to the store.”  “I’m on the verge of winning this poker game,” or whatever.  “R ome wasn’t built in a day, you know,” Carmen says.  This is also an old expression : “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”  It means that if you are doing something imp ortant it takes time; it can take a long time, you can’t try to do it quickly.  The g reat City of Rome, with all of its wonderful buildings and architecture, wasn’t built in a day, meaning it took many years – hundreds of years to make it what it is.  W ell, that’s the expression, and that’s what Carmen is saying to Eric.  She’s doing something great by preparing herself, I guess.

Eric says, “A day?  I’d settle for a week.”  “To se ttle for” is an expression that means to accept something that isn’t exactly what y ou wanted, but is good enough “I settled for living in this apartment.”  I t isn’t my favorite place, but it’s good enough for me.  It will be satisfactory; not g reat, not terrible.  Eric is making a joke, saying that, in effect, he doesn’t want to build Rome in a day, he would take a week, that would be okay.  Eric says, “Why is it that every time we have someplace to be you’re always running late?”  “To r un late” means to be behind schedule, to do things too slowly so that you can’t  complete them when you are expected to complete them.

Carmen says, “That’s because I march to the beat of  a different drummer.”  This is another old expression: “To march to the beat (b eat) of a different drummer.” A “drummer” is someone who plays a drum, usually th ey have two sticks and they hit the drum.  The “beat” is the repeating str ess that appears – that you hear in the music.  It’s what you will often hear in a r ock band, for example, the drummer playing.  The drummer will be playing the s ame thing over and over again, repeating it.  That is often the beat for the song.  Carmen says, “I march (I walk) to the beat of a different drummer.”  What sh e’s saying is that I do things differently than other people, I don’t follow what everyone else does.  Drummers are often used especially in the military – or used  to be used – to keep everyone going forward at the same speed.  Carmen says, “Lif e isn’t about watching the clock; it’s about living in the moment.”  “To watch  the clock” means that you are

always aware of what time it is and you try to be p laces on time, on schedule, you’re not late.  You’re making sure that you arriv e or other people arrive on time. But that’s not what Carmen says life is about, that ’s not the purpose of life.  Life is about living in the moment.  “To live in the mom ent” means that you’re not thinking about or worrying about the past, you’re n ot worried about the future, you’re only thinking about what’s happening right n ow.  You want to experience the present completely and fully.  That’s to live in the moment, not to worry about the future or the past, but just about what you are  experiencing right now.

Eric says, “Okay, at this very moment, we’re late.”   “Very” has many uses in English.  Here, it is used for emphasis to mean exa ctly or precisely.  “I fell in love with my now-wife the very moment I saw her the firs t time.”  At that exact moment, I fell in love.  Doesn’t every woman want to hear that?  Eric says that at this very moment, right now, we’re late.

Carmen says, “Just give me a couple of minutes more  and I’ll be ready.”  “To give (someone) a couple of minutes” means to give them a little more time, not to try to rush them, not to try to make them go faster , not to continue asking them to go faster.  Carmen says, “After all, none of our fr iends expect us to be punctual anymore.  They all know better.”  She’s saying if y ou think about it, I mean in terms of what’s most important; that’s the meaning of the expression “after all.” “After all, none of our friends expect us to be pun ctual anymore.”  “To be punctual” (punctual) means to be on time, to arrive  when people are expecting you to arrive.  She says that their friends all kno w better.  The expression “to know better” means that you have enough experience of something or knowledge of something to know how it will actually  be, which is different than how it should be or how someone tells you it will b e.  So you might say, for example, “My sister-in-law said she would be here a t 5:30, but I know better. She won’t be here until six.”  “I know better,” I h ave experience; I have knowledge about when she normally arrives, and it’s  normally late.  I know better.

Eric says, “Yeah, and I should, too,” meaning I sho uld know better as well. “From now on, I’ll start getting ready when you say  you’re all set.”  “To be all set” means to be completely prepared, to be completely r eady, you don’t need any more time.  Eric says that when Carmen says that sh e’s all set, then he’ll start getting ready.  “Then,” he says, “I’ll just have mi nutes to wait – not hours!”  In other words, Eric is going to wait, in the future, until Carmen says she’s ready, and then he’ll get ready.  That way – in that manne r, he won’t have to wait hours for her to get ready, it will only be minutes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carmen:  Hold your horses.  I’m on the verge of bei ng ready.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.

She’s always punctual; she never runs late.  That’s  our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.
