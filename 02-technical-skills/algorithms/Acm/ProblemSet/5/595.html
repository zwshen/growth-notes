<P>
In western music the twelve notes used in musical notation are identified with the capital letters A 
through G, possibly followed by a sharp `#' or flat `b' character, and are arranged as shown below.  A 
slash is used to identify alternate notations of the same note.

<P>
<PRE>
C/B#   C#/Db   D   D#/Eb   E/Fb   F/E#   F#/Gb   G   G#/Ab   A   A#/Bb   B/Cb
</PRE>

<P>
Any two adjacent notes in the above list are separated by a <EM>semitone</EM>.  Any two notes that have exactly 
one note separating them in the above list are separated by a <EM>tone</EM>.  A <EM>major scale</EM> is composed of eight 
notes; it begins on one of the above notes and follows the progression tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-
tone-semitone from left to right in the list above, wrapping from B/Cb to C/B# when necessary.  For 
example, the major scales starting on C and Db, respectively, are made up of the following notes:

<P>
<PRE>
C   D   E  F   G   A   B  C
Db  Eb  F  Gb  Ab  Bb  C  Db
</PRE>

<P>
The following rules also apply to major scales:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The scale will contain each letter from A to G once and only once, with the exception of first letter 
of the scale which repeated as the last letter of the scale.
<DT>2.
<DD>The scale may not contain a combination of both flat and sharp notes.
</DL>

<P>
The note which begins a major scale is referred to as the key of the scale.  For example, the scales above 
are the scales for the major keys of C and Db, respectively.  Transposing notes from one scale to 
another is a simple matter of replacing a note in one scale with the note in the corresponding position of 
another scale.  For example, the note F in the major key of C would transpose to the note Gb in the 
major key of Db since both notes occupy the same position (fourth) in their respective scales.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The object of this problem is to write a program that will transpose notes from one major scale to 
another.  An input file will contain several lines, each of which contains a source key, target key, and list 
of one or more notes to be transposed.  An output file should be generated which indicates the 
transposed notes, as well as indicating major scales that are not valid and notes that are not valid in a 
given major scale.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
Each line of the input, except for the last, will contain two musical keys followed by a list of notes to be 
transposed from the major scale of the first key to the major scale of the second key.  Each list is 
terminated by a single asterisk character.  The final line of the input contains only a single asterisk.  All 
notes on a line and the terminating asterisk are delimited by a single space

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each input line which defines a transposition problem, several lines will be produced in the output 
file.  If the source and target keys are valid, then the first output line for each input line should read 
``<TT>Transposing from </TT><I>X</I> <TT>to </TT><I>Y</I><TT>:</TT>" where <I>X</I> is the source key and <I>Y</I> is the target key.  
<B>If either the source or 
target key is not valid</B>,  output one line which reads ``<TT>Key of </TT><I>X</I>(or <I>Y</I>) <TT>is not a valid major key</TT>", 
where <I>X</I>(or <I>Y</I>) is the key that is not valid.  If both the source and target key are not valid, report 
only the source key. The remainder of the input for that line is to be skipped.  

<P>
<BR>
For input lines which contain valid source and target keys, the first output line will be followed by one 
output line for each note to be transposed.  If the note is a valid note in the major scale of the source 
key then the output line should read ``<I>M</I><TT> transposes to </TT><I>N</I>" where <I>M</I> is the note in the source key and <I>N</I> 
is the corresponding note in the target key.  If the input note is not a valid note in the major scale of the 
source key then the output line should read ``<I>M</I><TT> is not a valid note in the </TT><I>X</I><TT> major scale</TT>" where <I>M</I> is the 
input note and <I>X</I> is the source key.  Observe that for either valid or non-valid notes the output line 
begins with precisely two spaces.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Print a blank line between the output data for each input line.  All output formatting 
rules described above must be observed precisely.
