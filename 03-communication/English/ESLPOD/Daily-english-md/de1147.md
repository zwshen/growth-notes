In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Cheech and Boo about types of students in the school – the names t hat we give different kinds of students in a school, especially a high school. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cheech: Is this your old yearbook?

Boo: Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my closet.

Cheech: Look at your picture! You look like you wer e an honor roll student.

Boo: Don’t be fooled. I was just an average student , not the valedictorian, but not a dropout either.

Cheech: Who is that? She’s very pretty.

Boo: That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything. She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.

Cheech: So she was a nerd.

Boo: No, not at all. She was also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body president.

Cheech: Wow, she must have been popular.

Boo: She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up. She got alon g with everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders. She was frie nds with geeks and goths, too. Everybody liked her.

Cheech: Where is she now? Do you still keep in touc h?

Boo: Yes, of course. She’s doing very well and is v ery successful.

Cheech: And single?

Boo: Yeah, but you’re not her type.

Cheech: And what type is that?

Boo: You? Definitely a druggie.

Cheech begins our dialogue by asking Boo, “Is this your old yearbook?” A “yearbook” (yearbook) – one word – is a book publis hed at the end of a school year, usually for a high school, that has photograp hs of all the students and teachers in the school, as well as photos and perha ps stories about the athletic teams, the clubs, and other activities at the schoo l. Most American high schools have a yearbook that students can buy. When I was i n high school, I was the editor of my school yearbook, meaning I was the per son responsible for picking the photographs and helping write the descriptions in the yearbook.

True story: I actually wrote something in the yearb ook at the very end of the book that the teachers – especially the leader of the sc hool, the principal – didn’t like, and so before the book was given to the rest of the  students, they went through and cut out that piece of paper (half a piece of pa per, actually) and then gave the books out so all the books were missing a half a pi ece of paper, a half a page at the end of the book. Well that’s a long story. We’l l talk about that some other time.

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Cheech asks Boo, “Is that your old yearbook?” Boo says, “Yeah, I found it while cleaning out my c loset.” Cheech says, “Look at your picture! You look like you were an honor roll student.” The “honor (honor) roll (roll)” is a list of the best students in the school – or to be more precise, the students who got the best grades that quarter, or s emester, or perhaps even year. Sometimes the schools will put up a list of t he students with the best grades. The idea, of course, is to try to encourage  students to get better grades.

 Cheech says that Boo looks like she was an honor ro ll student, perhaps because she looks intelligent. I don’t know. Boo says, “Don ’t to be fooled,” meaning don’t think that just because I looked smart, I was smart . She says, “I was just an average student” – that is, not a great student, no t a bad student. She says that she was “not the valedictorian, but not a dropout e ither.” The “valedictorian” (valedictorian) is the best student in a given scho ol.

The valedictorian is the student that has the highe st grades, the best grades, throughout their entire time at that school. Usuall y at the graduation ceremony, when the school celebrates the end of the schooling  of a certain group of students who are graduating from the school, there is a recognition of the valedictorian, and sometimes the valedictorian gets  to give a little speech at the graduation ceremony. So, the valedictorian is the b est student in the school. At the other end, we have someone who is a “dropout” ( dropout). A dropout is a person who doesn’t complete their schooling.

In the United States, in many states you only have to go to school until you’re 16 years old. After that, if you don’t want to go to s chool anymore – to high school, that is – you can drop out. You will be a “dropout”  – someone who doesn’t complete his schooling, his education. Of course, y ou can also go to college and then be a dropout, but we don’t normally talk about  college dropouts. Usually when we talk about a “dropout,” we’re referring to a high school dropout.

Cheech says, “Who is that? She’s very pretty.” Boo says, “That’s my friend Marlene. In high school, she was good at everything . She had a high GPA and took every available AP class.” A “GPA” is a grade point average. Basically, it’s the number that is calculated from all of your grad es. Traditionally, high schools give a certain number of points to a grade. So the grade of A is four points, the grade of B is three points, the grade of C is two p oints, and so forth. You take all of the grades and then you come up with an average grade. We call that the “grade point average,” or more commonly, simply the  “GPA.”

Boo is telling us that her friend Marlene had a hig h GPA, which means she was a very good student, and “took every available AP cla ss.” “To take a class” means to be a student in that class, to study that subjec t. “AP” refers to “Advanced Placement.” Advanced Placement or AP courses are sp ecial high school courses that at the end of the year have special exams. If you score very well on these exams, you can get college credit. Many universitie s will give you a certain number of credits if you get a high score on these exams.

These exams of course cost money, and most students  who take the exams don’t get a high enough score to get credit. But of  course the company, the private company that gives the exam still gets your  money. So, it’s a great way for the company to make a lot of money. Not such a great way for students to get college credit. In any case, the Advanced Placement  courses in a high school are considered the most difficult, often the ones that are hardest to get a good grade in. My high school didn’t have any AP courses, prob ably because we weren’t smart enough to be in those kinds of classes.

Cheech responds to Boo’s description of Marlene by saying, “So she was a nerd.” A “nerd” (nerd) is a smart person but one wh o doesn’t seem to be able to get along with other people or, perhaps more correc tly, is a little socially awkward. A nerd is a person who can get good grades  but doesn’t seem to be very good at talking to other people or relating to  other people. Boo says, “No, not at all,” meaning Marlene was not a nerd. “She w as also a jock, a member of lots of student clubs, and was student body preside nt.”

A “jock” (jock) is an informal term for an athlete,  especially a student who likes to play sports, although it doesn’t necessarily have t o be a student. “Student clubs” are groups or organizations that usually the school  itself organizes and are for students who have different interests. There might be a photography club or a writing club. These clubs usually have meetings aft er school or outside of the regular student classes. To be the “student body pr esident” means to be the elected leader of all the students. The “student bo dy” refers to the entire group of students, all of the students in the school.

It’s common in American high schools for the school  to have an election where all the students vote for a president, and often vi ce president, of the entire school. Now, this is a little different from a simi lar term, “class president.” Each level in a high school (that is, in a typical high school), a ninth grade, tenth grade, eleventh grade, and twelfth grade – those are the f our levels. Each of those levels also elects leader called a “class president .”

In addition, there is what’s called a “student gove rnment,” sometimes called a “student council.” That is the group that organizes  events for the school. So, the “student body president” is, in a sense, the presid ent of the student council, the leader of the student council. But everyone votes o n who will be the student body president. And in addition, each class – each level , each grade – also has a president. So, there are lots of presidents in Amer ican high schools it would seem. Was I ever student body president or even stu dent class president? Absolutely not.

Cheech says, “Wow, she,” meaning Marlene, “must hav e been popular” – that is, she must have been well liked. Boo says, “She was, but she wasn’t stuck-up.” The term “stuck (stuck) – up (up)” means arrogant, someone who thinks he or she is better than everyone else. It’s the kind of term that you would hear in a high school. You don’t hear people use that term ve ry much in an adult conversation, but I suppose you could use it. Boo s ays that Marlene “got along with” – was friendly with – “everybody, not just the football players and cheerleaders.”

Boo means that Marlene was friendly and was able to  get along with everyone, not just the people who you might expect a popular student to get along with – the football players and the cheerleaders. A “cheer leader” (cheerleader) is someone who, well, cheers or encourages people at a  sporting event, typically, to yell and to support the athletic team that’s pla ying. In an American high school, boys on the football team and girls on the cheerlea ding squad, or the team of cheerleaders, are usually the most popular students  in the school. Was I a football player or a cheerleader? Of course not.

Boo says, “She was friends with geeks and goths, to o.” A “geek” (geek) is similar to a nerd. It’s a very smart person who knows a lot  about especially scientific or technical topics, but might not be the most sociabl e person. A “goth” (goth) is a person who enjoys wearing black clothing (often lea ther, chains) and listens to a certain kind of music. Was I a goth? I would have t o say no. Besides, there weren’t any goths in the school I went to. I must h ave gone to school before that became popular.

Cheech says, “Where is she now,” meaning where is M arlene now? Where does she live? “Do you still keep in touch?” – that is, are you still in communication? Do you still talk to each other? Boo says, “Yes, of  course. She’s doing very well and is very successful.” Cheech then asks, “And sin gle?” meaning is she not married or not involved in a romantic relationship?

Boo says, “Yeah, but you’re not her type,” meaning you’re not the kind of man she would be interested in. Cheech says, “And what type is that?” Here, Cheech is asking what type, what kind of person Boo thinks  that he is, not what kind of person Marlene is interested in. Boo says, “You? De finitely a druggie.” A “druggie” (druggie) is a person who consumes illega l drugs. Was I a druggie when I was in school? No, not really. We didn’t hav e any drugs when I was in school. In fact, I’m so old there weren’t any drugs  when I was in school. Yeah, it’s true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
