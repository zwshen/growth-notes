This episode is a dialogue between Jim and Tammy ca lled “Disagreeing about Religion.”  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Jim:  You know that religion is a taboo subject, es pecially with Paul.  Why were you baiting him all through dinner? 

Tammy:  I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very differe nt views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him. 

Jim:  You were making disparaging remarks about his  faith and some of the things he holds most sacred.  I think you were tryi ng to be provocative. 

Tammy:  I may have said a few things that were prov ocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.  

Jim:  There you go again!  People’s religious belie fs shouldn’t be called superstitions. 

Tammy:  I’m just calling it like I see it.  I didn’ t know you were such a fundamentalist. 

Jim:  I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact, I’m an at heist, or at least an agnostic, but I still try to show respect for other people’s belief s. 

Tammy:  Beliefs are made to be challenged.  If you can’t defend your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them. 

Jim:  Ladies and gentlemen, behold the voice of tol erance.

It’s commonly accepted by most Americans that if yo u are among strangers – among people you don’t know – you don’t typically d iscuss politics or religion. But that’s not what happened in our dialogue.  Jim says to Tammy, “You know that religion is a taboo subject, especially with P aul.”  “Religion,” of course, refers to a system of belief, a system of practices about how to run your life.  It usually involves certain ceremonies, what we would call “ri tuals,” that are connected with it.  Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism; all of  these could be considered religions.  A “taboo” (taboo) here means something that is unacceptable in a particular culture or society; it’s something that you don’t talk about because it is considered so evil or so bad or so controversial.  Jim asks, “Why were you baiting him (baiting Paul) all through dinner?”  “T o bait (bait) (someone)” is to say certain things in order to get a strong reaction fr om that person, often to make them angry, to say something you know will make the m angry.  “Bait,” as a noun, is what you use to try to catch fish.  You put the bait on the end of a long string that you put down into the water, and the fish come s and gets the bait – the food – and then you pull on the string – on the line, th e fishing line – in order to catch the fish.  That’s where that expression comes from.  

Tammy says, “I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very di fferent views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.”  “Sp irituality” is a more general term used to talk about one’s interest in and belie fs about the meaning of life, the meaning of religion.  Nowadays, depending on where you see it, it often refers to what we might call “alternative” religious experien ces, those that are not part of the more popular religions such as Christianity, Ju daism, Islam, and so forth.  But it can also be used to describe someone in a partic ular religion, their particular beliefs and ideas about something. 

Jim then says, “You were making disparaging remarks  about his faith.”  “To make disparaging remarks” means to say something to show  that you don’t think something else is good, you don’t think it’s import ant, to say bad things about another person or another idea that you don’t like.   A “remark” is simply a comment, something you say.  “Disparaging” means to  criticize it, to say it is bad or wrong.  Jim says Tammy was making disparaging re marks about Paul’s faith. “Faith” here means simply his belief in something.  He says that she was making disparaging remarks about some of the things that P aul holds most sacred. “Sacred” (sacred) here means holy, related to God, related to religion.  He “holds them sacred,” that’s just the expression we use.  W e use the verb “hold” meaning he has these beliefs, he believes these things are holy, that you shouldn’t criticize them or make fun of them.  Jim then says to Tammy, “I think you were  

trying to be provocative.”  “To be provocative” mea ns to do something that makes other people upset, it might even make them angry.  It definitely is something that produces a strong reaction.  Sometimes it can be us ed in a sexual sense; if someone says, “That dress is very provocative,” the y mean that it is sexy, that it produces a certain reaction in the people who see i t, not always positive. 

Tammy says, “I may have said a few things that were  provocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions. ”  “Superstition” (superstition) is a belief in things that are lucky or not lucky.  So for example, some people have a rabbit’s foot – at least they used to, I don ’t know if they sell rabbits’ feet anymore.  But when I was a child you could buy a ra bbit’s foot, and this was considered a lucky object; it was actually called a  lucky “charm” (charm).  This is much closer to the idea of magic, where if you do s omething, something will happen automatically, no question about it. 

Tammy is saying that Paul is someone who believes i n superstitions.  Jim says, “There you go again!”  “There you go again” is a ph rase used to emphasize that you have just done exactly what you were denying or  promising not to do again. The phrase was made famous back in a political deba te in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.  When Carter made some sta tement, Reagan turned to him and said, “There you go again Mr. President, ” something like that.  But in more general terms, it just means that you are sayi ng to the person you are doing whatever they said they weren’t going to do a gain.   

Jim says, “People’s religious beliefs shouldn’t be called superstitions.”  Tammy says, “I’m just calling it like I see it.”  The phr ase “to call (something) like you see it” means that you are giving your true opinion, an d you’re not worried about what other people are going to think or say.  You’re not  worried about making other people angry or not, you’re simply describing the s ituation as you perceive it – as you see it.  Tammy is a little confused since super stition and magic are based on the idea that if you do certain things, as I mentio ned earlier, other things will happen.  If you say certain words certain results a re guaranteed, if you will.  So God, or the gods, or some higher power doesn’t real ly have a choice.  In religion it’s somewhat the opposite; most religions believe that there are certain things you should do, but that God or the higher power is the one who’s in control, not you.  But Tammy knows that this is considered an in sulting term, really, for people who are religious, and so she uses that term  “superstitious,” or “superstitions.”  Then she says, “I didn’t know you  (Jim) were such a fundamentalist.”  Once again, the word “fundamental ist” is one that is sometimes used as an insult, not in all cases.  A “fundamenta list” would be someone who follows religious laws very strictly, does everythi ng they’re supposed to do, and believes in every aspect of the religion.  In the U nited States it has other  

meanings, more technical if you will, but we won’t go into those here.  Tammy is really using the word as an insult in a general sen se, without perhaps understanding exactly the technical differences in what fundamentalism really means. 

Jim says, “I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact,” Jim  says, “I’m an atheist, or at least an agnostic.”  An “atheist” is a person who does no t believe in God or in gods. It’s a person who denies the existence of a higher power of a god.  An “agnostic” (agnostic) is a person who says that they don’t kno w whether God exists or not, a person who believes that it isn’t possible, perhaps , to know that God exists.  So Jim is also confused; he’s not sure if he’s an athe ist or an agnostic.  He says, however, “I still try to show respect for other peo ple’s beliefs.  Tammy says, “Beliefs (things that you believe in) are made to b e challenged (are made to be defended).”  In fact, she says, “If you can’t defen d your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.”  “To defend” means to protect something  or someone from someone else who’s attacking them; to say or do things, in this case, to show that what you believe is true and you have good reasons for belie ving that. 

Jim then makes a joke; he says, “Ladies and gentlem en, behold the voice of tolerance.”  “Ladies and gentlemen” is what you say  when you are talking to a large group of people and trying to get their atten tion – trying to get them to listen to you.  Here, though, it’s just Tammy and Jim, so he’s joking.  He says, “behold the voice of tolerance.”  “Behold” (behold) is a ve ry formal word that means to draw attention to something.  Nowadays it’s used mo re as a joke; it’s not used in the way that it perhaps used to be used.  So Jim is  saying “everyone look at this person.”  He calls Tammy “the voice of tolerance.”  “The voice of…” means that she is speaking as if she were that person.  But th is isn’t a real person, this is an idea that she is apparently speaking for, and that idea is tolerance (tolerance). “Tolerance” is a willingness to let other people do , say, and believe what they want to without feeling like you have to criticize them or change them.  It’s allowing other people to be what they want to be.  Jim is making a joke; he’s saying that, in fact, Tammy is not a voice of toler ance, that by criticizing Paul she, in fact, is being intolerant, not allowing people t o believe what they want to, in a sense. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
