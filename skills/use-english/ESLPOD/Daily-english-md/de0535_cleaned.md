This episode is called “Describing Speed and Pace.”  It’s a  dialogue between Chiu and Sarah that uses a lot of vocabulary we use to de scribe how fast or how slow things go.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Chiu:  Come on, slowpoke, hurry up!  We’ll never get to  the top of the hill if you don’t get a move on. 

Sarah:  There’s no way you’re going to get me to move a t breakneck speed.  I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and my legs are about  to fall off.  Tell me again why we’re trudging up this hill? 

Chiu:  It’s the only way to the ruins and the view from there will really be worth your while.  Trust me.  Pick up the pace or we won’t get  there before sunset! 

Sarah:  It’s not like I’m dawdling here.  I may be movi ng at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling over.  If you’r e in such a hurry, you can sprint up there by yourself.  Go ahead.  Impress me w ith your blinding speed.   

Chiu:  I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself.  

Sarah:  Why?  Do you feel sorry for me? 

Chiu:  Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged .  

  Sarah:  Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than men tally challenged!   

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Chiu saying to Sarah, “Come o n, slowpoke, hurry up!” A “slowpoke” (slowpoke – one word) is an informal, somewh at insulting term to describe someone who moves very slowly, who doesn’t move very qu ickly.  It’s a sort of thing that you might hear children say to each ot her: “You’re such a slowpoke!  Why can’t you run faster?”  Oh, wait a minute;  that’s what they used to say to me!  Anyway, “slowpoke” is someone who moves very slo wly.  So, Chiu is telling her to “hurry up,” to go faster, to increase your speed.  He says, “We’ll never get to the top of the hill if you don’t get a m ove on.”  “To get a move on” is another informal expression meaning to hurry, to begin moving more quickly.  It’s something a parent might say to their child: “Hey!  Let’ s get a move on, we have to leave here by eight o’clock.” 

Sarah says, “There’s no way you’re going to get me to mo ve at breakneck speed.”  Something that is “breakneck” (breakneck – one wo rd) is something that is very quick, something that is so quick – so fast that it’s dangerous.  It’s so dangerous you could, if you fell, break your neck; I think that’s the general idea. Sarah says, “I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and m y legs are about to fall off.”  The expression “my legs are about to fall o ff” means she’s very, very tired.  She says, “Tell me again why we’re trudging up  this hill?”  “To trudge” (trudge) means to walk very slowly because, perhaps, it’s very difficult to walk up, or because you really don’t want to be doing what you’r e doing, walking in the direction you’re walking. 

Chiu says, “It’s the only way to the ruins and the view fro m there will really be worth your while.”  So, Sarah and Chiu are obviously visi ting some tourist area, and they’re going up to see some ruins.  “Ruins,” as a plural noun (and it is always used, in this sense, as a plural noun), is what is le ft of an old building or group of buildings, usually something that is very old, so mething that is of historical interest.  So when you go to Rome, in Italy, you can see the ruins of the Forum, a famous area in the center part of Rome.  You  can see what remains of the old buildings from the ancient Romans of 2,000 year s ago.  “Ruin,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English, both as a  verb and a noun.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions. 

Chiu says that it will be worth your while.  The expressi on “to be worth your while” means that it is worth the effort; if you do i t, it will have something very pleasant or nice at the end that will justify what you a re doing – that will be a  

  good reason for doing what you’re doing.  Chiu says, “Tr ust me (have trust in me).  Pick up the pace or we won’t get there before su nset!”  “To pick up the pace” (pace) means to increase your speed, to move more qu ickly, to hurry up. It’s similar to “get a move on,” although “get a move o n” is usually a command. Here, he’s also using the expression as a command, “pick up  your pace,” but it could be use otherwise.  For example: “The cyclist picked up  per pace in trying to win the race.”  She decided to go faster. 

Sarah says, “It’s not like I’m dawdling here.”  “It’s not  like” means I am not – I am not dawdling.  “To dawdle” (dawdle) means to move very  slowly, to take a long time to do something or to go somewhere.  It’s a critici sm to say someone is dawdling; they’re wasting time, they’re not moving as fa st as they could because they’re lazy or for whatever reason.  Sarah says, “I may be moving at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling o ver.”  A “snail’s pace” means very, very slowly.  A “snail” is a small animal that ha s the reputation for moving very slowly.  So, “to move at a snail’s pace” means t o move very slowly. She says, “this is as fast as I can manage (as fast as I can wa lk) without keeling over.”  “To keel (keel) over” is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to fall over or fall down because you are very tired, or perhaps because you are  very sick – very ill. Somebody once said to me, “Hey, Jeff.  You should run a  marathon,” the 26-plus miles that people race sometimes, and I say, “If I ran a  marathon, I would probably keel over after the first two miles,” meaning  I would be so tired that I wouldn’t survive – which is probably true! 

Sarah says, “If you’re in such a hurry, you can sprint up the re by yourself.”  “To sprint” means to run very quickly over a short distance.  In t he Olympics, they have a competition for the runner who can run the faste st 100 meters.  We call these runners “sprinters,” they run very fast, but for short  distances.  The opposite would be a “long distance runner,” someone wh o can run for miles and miles.  Sarah tells Chiu he can sprint up there by himse lf.  She says, “Go ahead. Impress me with your blinding speed.”  “Blinding,” here , means very fast, very impressive, making you amazed at how fast or how well some one does something.  “Blind” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Here, it means very impressive.   

Chiu says, “I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself .”  I’m not going to let you be by yourself, I’m going to stay with you.  Sarah says, “Why?  Do you feel sorry for me?”  Do you have sympathy for me?  Do you feel  badly because I am experiencing something difficult or painful?  Chiu says, “ Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged.”  This is a joke.  “To be ph ysically challenged” means that your body is not able to do what other bodie s can do because of  

  some injury or perhaps you were born with a certain di sease or illness. “Physically challenged” is a term that is fairly new; you wi ll also hear people talk about “physical disabilities,” that means something simila r.  The older term for that would be “handicapped,” which is still used.  Peop le talk about the handicapped parking spaces; these are special spaces that ar e supposed to be used only for people who have some physical disability – who  are physically challenged in some way. 

Sarah says, “Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than me ntally challenged!” She says, “Oh, yeah?” meaning “you think so?” Usually we use that expression when you’re angry with someone or you’re about to repl y to someone’s insult. She replies to Chiu’s insult – Chiu’s joke by saying, “Bett er physically challenged than mentally challenged,” meaning it is better to be physically challenged – to have a physical disability than to be mentally challenged.  “Mentally challenged” is someone who has some sort of mental illness, someone wh o has a medical condition that prevents them from being able to think properly.  Once again, this is a more modern, more recent term.  It’s probably used more now as a joke than as an actual description.  Somebody says, “Why did you do such a stupid thing, are you mentally challenged?” meaning do you have some sor t of intellectual problem.  It can be use, basically, to say that someone is d umb, but the more technical meaning is someone who would have a mental il lness or something that makes them unable to be able to reason and think as a normal human being would be able to do. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Chiu:  Come on, slowpoke, hurry up!  We’ll never get to  the top of the hill if you don’t get a move on. 

Sarah:  There’s no way you’re going to get me to move a t breakneck speed.  I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and my legs are about  to fall off.  Tell me again why we’re trudging up this hill? 

Chiu:  It’s the only way to the ruins and the view from there will really be worth your while.  Trust me.  Pick up the pace or we won’t get  there before sunset! 

Sarah:  It’s not like I’m dawdling here.  I may be movi ng at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling over.  If you’r e in such a hurry, you can sprint up there by yourself.  Go ahead.  Impress me w ith your blinding speed.   

  Chiu:  I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself.  

Sarah:  Why?  Do you feel sorry for me? 

Chiu:  Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged . 

Sarah:  Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than men tally challenged!
