# Trying to Locate Someone

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 929 – Trying to Locate Someone.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 929. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can download it at ESLPod.com. In this episode, Carmen and Antonio are looking for someone. They're trying to find or locate someone. Let’s get  started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Carmen: Hi, I’m looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time. Have you seen him? 

Antonio: Waldo? I haven’t seen him in a while. He c omes in sometimes, but it’s pretty hit-and-miss.  

Carmen: I can’t seem to pin him down. Every time I think I’m hot on his trail, I’m too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground . 

Antonio: That’s Waldo. He’s the most elusive person  I know. I think he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to locate him.  

Carmen: I’m starting to get that feeling. I’ve been  trying to track him down for over two months.  

Antonio: He does seem to have a sixth sense and kno ws when to vanish.  

Carmen: I’m starting to think he doesn’t really exi st and that he’s just a figment of my imagination.  

Antonio: It’s funny you should say that. I think hi s ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.

Carmen begins our dialogue by saying to Antonio, “H i, I'm looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time.” “To come in” somewhere means, really, to go to a certain place. “From time  to time” means sometimes but not always. We might also use the word “occasionall y.” Carmen says to Antonio, “Have you seen him?” meaning “Have you seen Waldo?”   

Antonio says, “Waldo? I haven't seen him in a while ” – in a long time. “He comes in sometimes, but it's pretty hit-and-miss.” The ex pression or the phrase “hit-and- miss” means “unpredictable” – sometimes it's true, sometimes it isn't true. In this case, it means sometimes Waldo is there, wherever “ there” is, and sometimes he isn't. Antonio says that it's “pretty” – or “very” – hit-and-miss.”  

Carmen says, “I can't seem to pin him down.” “To pi n (pin) someone down” means to, in this case, force them to make a decisi on about something, or perhaps to understand someone clearly. I'm not sure  which is the case here for Carmen – which meaning she's talking about. Normall y, “to pin someone down” is to get them to say yes or no to a question they perhaps don't want to make a decision about. 

Carmen says, “Every time I think I'm hot on his tra il, I'm too late.” “To be hot on someone's trail” (trail) means to be very close to finding someone or finding something. Usually, we use this expression when the  person is being chased or pursued by, for example, the police. When the polic e are trying to catch a criminal, they may be hot on their trail. I'm not, again, sure what Carmen is talking about here.  

She says, “Every time [I think] I'm hot on his trai l, I'm too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground.” The expression “to skip ( skip) town” means to leave your town, to leave the place where you are living without telling anyone where you went. Usually, the expression is used when some one, for example, owes you a lot of money or has a lot of debt, and they need to escape because they don't have the money to pay you. In that case, we might u se this phrase “to skip town.” He skipped town because he didn't want to pay his f riend back the $5,000 that he borrowed.  

“To go underground” means to hide yourself or whate ver activities you are participating in. It means to do something secretly . “To go underground,” if you’re a person, means to hide, to make sure no one finds you, probably because you've done something wrong. That seems to be the c ase with Waldo, here. Carmen says, “He’s skipped town or has gone undergr ound.”  

Antonio says, “That's Waldo,” meaning that's what w e would expect from someone like Waldo. “He's the most elusive person I  know.” “To be elusive” (elusive) means to be difficult to find, or it coul d also mean something that is difficult to achieve, something that is difficult t o accomplish. I want to be in the Olympics, but it's an elusive goal. It's a very dif ficult goal for me to attain, for me to achieve. Maybe someday, though, if they have a p odcasting Olympics. I definitely think I could win a gold medal. Well, a silver medal, anyway.  

Antonio says Waldo is very elusive. He says, “I thi nk he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to  locate him.” Antonio is saying that Waldo likes or actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse. “To play a game of cat and mouse” is to be in a situati on where someone is trying to find you and you hide or you do things to avoid get ting caught.  

If you think about what a cat and mouse would do if  they were in the same room, you kind of get the idea of what we're talking abou t here. The mouse would try to run away from the cat, and the cat would try to cat ch the mouse. So, “playing a game of cat and mouse” means hiding from someone el se who's trying to catch you. That's what Waldo likes to do. He likes to do this with people who are trying to locate or find him.  

Carmen says, “I'm starting to get that feeling.” Sh e means, “I am beginning to understand that that is the truth.” She says, “I've  been trying to track him down for over two months.” “To track (track) someone dow n” is a phrasal verb meaning to find someone, especially someone who is difficul t to locate. “My ex-girlfriend tried to track me down, but I changed my name so th at she wouldn't find me on the Internet. Don't tell anybody.”  

Antonio says that Waldo “does seem to have a sixth sense and knows when to vanish.” “To have a sixth (sixth) sense” means to h ave a feeling about something – an intuition, we might call it, not necessarily a  reason. You think something is going to happen; you're not sure why. You can't get  an intellectual analysis of the situation, but you just seem to know – you seem to sense it. That's what a “sixth sense” is. Of course, we normally talk about the fi ve senses that a human being has: you can see, you can hear, you can taste, you can touch, and you can smell. Those are the five senses. The “sixth sense”  is this idea that somehow you have some additional power.  

There was a movie, you may remember, with Bruce Wil lis called The Sixth Sense – a very scary movie, but a very good one. The famo us line or sentence from that movie was “I see dead people.” I see dead people. T here are no dead people in this dialogue, however.   

 Antonio says that Waldo has a sixth sense and “know s when to vanish” (vanish). “To vanish” is to disappear. Carmen says, “I'm star ting to think he doesn't really exist and that he's just a figment of my imaginatio n.” Carmen is beginning to wonder whether Waldo is even a real person, whether  he really exists. She says maybe he's “just a figment (figment) of my imaginat ion.” To be a “figment of your imagination” means something that you’ve invented, something that you’ve created in your own mind but that is not real. Anto nio says, “It's funny you should say that.” “It's funny” here doesn't mean Antonio i s laughing. He means it's interesting or it's curious.  

He says, “I think (Waldo's) ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.” Your “ultimate goal” is the most important objective, the most important thing that you want to accomplish. “To be invisible ” (invisible) means no one can see you. Antonio is saying that Waldo's ultimate go al is to be invisible, “just another face in the crowd.” A “face in the crowd” m eans that no one can distinguish you from anyone else. You're very ordin ary. You're very normal. No one would notice you. Antonio is saying that Waldo wants to be just another face in the crowd – someone that no one notices and, the refore, no one can find.  

My own theory is that Antonio is Waldo. That's righ t, Antonio is Waldo, but he's hiding. He has something on his face so that Carmen  can't recognize him. Maybe Carmen is Antonio's – that is, Waldo's – ex-girlfri end. That would explain this dialogue.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Carmen: Hi, I’m looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time. Have you seen him? 

Antonio: Waldo? I haven’t seen him in a while. He c omes in sometimes, but it’s pretty hit-and-miss.  

Carmen: I can’t seem to pin him down. Every time I think I’m hot on his trail, I’m too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground . 

Antonio: That’s Waldo. He’s the most elusive person  I know. I think he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to locate him.  

Carmen: I’m starting to get that feeling. I’ve been  trying to track him down for over two months.  

Antonio: He does seem to have a sixth sense and kno ws when to vanish.  

Carmen: I’m starting to think he doesn’t really exi st and that he’s just a figment of my imagination.  

Antonio: It’s funny you should say that. I think hi s ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.

Our dialogues are never hit-and-miss because they’r e written by the wonderful, although elusive, Dr. Lucy Tse.
