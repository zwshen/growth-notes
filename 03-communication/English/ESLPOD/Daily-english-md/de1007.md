[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: Stop thief!

Police Officer: What happened?

Vanessa: I just got mugged. That guy stole my purse , jewelry, camera – all of my valuables!

Police Officer: Were you wearing flashy jewelry and  carrying an expensive camera? Those are big enticements for muggers.

Vanessa: I didn’t have anything on that was flashy,  and I was minding my own business.

Police Officer: Well, you should never go out alone  at night, and if you have to, stay in well-lighted areas. Traveling on dim street s makes you a target for thieves.

Vanessa: Thanks for that insight.

Police Officer: Can you describe the person who mug ged you?

Vanessa: No, it happened in a flash. I didn’t get a  good look at his face, but I’m sure it was a man.

Police Officer: It’s a good thing you weren’t hurt.  You should probably learn self- defense in case it happens again.

Vanessa: Thanks a lot. I think I’ve had as much adv ice as I can take in one night. Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?

Police Officer: Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t  get your hopes up.

Vanessa: Believe me, I won’t. [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Vanessa yelling, “Stop thi ef!” A “thief” (thief) is a person who steals something from someone else. Vanessa use s an expression that you would use if you are, say, in a store or out on the  street and someone comes and steals something from you. In order to get the atte ntion of other people so that they will stop this thief or help you, you say, “St op thief!”

A police officer is somewhere near Vanessa, and he says to Vanessa, “What happened?” Vanessa says, “I just got mugged.” “To g et mugged” (mugged) is to be robbed, especially when you are on the street or  in a bus or in some public place. To get mugged usually means to have your wal let or purse stolen. Vanessa says, “That guy stole my purse, jewelry, ca mera – all of my valuables.”

A “purse” (purse) is sometimes called a “handbag.” It’s a small bag carried by a woman, typically, that is used to hold her money, h er makeup, her hairbrush, her identification, tonight’s dinner, a television – al l of these things will fit inside of a typical purse used by a woman. Well, maybe not a te levision. “This guy stole my purse,” Vanessa says. He also, or she also, stole h er jewelry and camera. “Jewelry” (jewelry) refers to things that you wear on your body, such as a necklace or a bracelet or rings or earrings.

Your “camera,” of course, is what you use to take p ictures with, photographs with. Vanessa says this thief stole all of her “val uables.” Your valuables are anything that costs money, that is expensive, that you own. We typically use this word in the plural – “valuables” – to refer to anyt hing that you own that someone could steal and that was worth a lot of money.

The police officer then asks Vanessa, “Were you wea ring flashy jewelry and carrying an expensive camera?” “Flashy” (flashy) re fers to something that gets a lot of attention, something that is expensive-looki ng. A lot of times you’ll see musicians, for example, wearing jewelry that is ver y noticeable, that you can see

very easily. We might describe this jewelry as bein g “flashy.” It’s expensive jewelry that you notice because it’s very easy to s ee.

The police officer is asking Vanessa if she was “we aring flashy jewelry and carrying an expensive camera.” He says, “Those are big enticements for muggers.” An “enticement” (enticement) is something  that will make someone want to do something, something that will motivate someone to do something. In this case, it will motivate a thief – a “mugger,” w hich is a person who mugs you – to steal whatever it is that you have.

Vanessa says, “I didn’t have anything on” – that is , I wasn’t wearing anything – “that was flashy, and I was minding my own business .” “To mind (mind) your own business” means to not be focusing on other people,  to be only worrying about yourself. Here, it probably means to not be botheri ng other people. “I’m minding my own business.” You may say this to someone as a command – “Mind your own business” – when the person is trying to ask yo u personal questions or get information from you that you don’t think are of an y concern to that person, that you don’t think that person should know.

Vanessa says she was minding her own business. The police officers says, “Well, you should never go out alone at night, and if you have to, stay in well- lighted areas.” “Well-lighted” refers to an area th at has a lot of streetlamps or an area that is not dark. The police officer is tellin g Vanessa she shouldn’t be out alone at night, which is probably good advice in mo st American cities.

The officer says, “Traveling on dim streets makes y ou a target for thieves.” “Dim” (dim) is the opposite of “well-lighted.” It means d ark, without a lot of light. A “target” (target) is the focus of your attention. I t could be a person or it could be a thing. Often, when we use the word “target,” we’re talking about attacking that thing or person. So, in a war, you may have a build ing as your target. You’re trying to blow up or destroy a building. That build ing is your target.

Here, the police officer is referring to a thief’s target – that is, the person that the thief is going to attack, the person the thief is g oing to steal from. Vanessa is not very happy with the police officer, who doesn’t see m to be helping her very much; rather, he seems to be just giving her some a dvice, and it seems to Vanessa that the advice is rather obvious – that sh e didn’t really need this advice from the police officer.

That’s why she says, “Thanks for that insight.” An “insight” (insight) is some understanding about something that is not obvious, but the way Vanessa says it, she’s indicating that it is obvious. The police off icer is telling her something that

he doesn’t need to tell her, because she already kn ows. Of course, the police officer might say, “Well, if you already know, then  why were you doing it?” But, back to our story . . .

The police officer then asks, “Can you describe the  person who mugged you?” Vanessa says, “No. It happened in a flash (flash).”  When we say something “happened in a flash,” we mean it happened very qui ckly – so quickly that you didn’t even realize what was happening until after it happened. Vanessa says, “I didn’t get a good look at his face,” although I gue ss she knows it’s a man. “But I’m sure it was a man” – and there she tells us.

The police officer says, “It’s a good thing you wer en’t hurt. You should probably learn self-defense in case it happens again.” “Self -defense” is the practice of using your body or something that you carry to defe nd yourself, to protect yourself against someone who attacks you, someone w ho is trying to hurt you. Once again, Vanessa thinks that this advice is some what obvious and not very helpful.

She says, “Thanks a lot,” but she says it in a way that indicates that she isn’t really thanking the officer. She’s telling the offi cer that this is not very helpful to her. She says, “I think I’ve had as much advice as I can take in one night.” “Advice” would be recommendations or suggestions th at someone gives you. She uses the expression “As much as I can take in o ne night,” meaning as much as I want to listen to, as much as I can handle. “I  don’t need any more advice,” she’s saying.

“Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?”  Vanessa is asking the police officer if he’s going to do anything to actually ca tch the thief. The police officers says, “Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t get your  hopes up.” “To file a report” means to fill out some paperwork – to fill out some form or to write a description of what happened – and give it, in this case, to the other police officers or to the police station.

In more general terms, the expression “to file a re port” is to officially inform someone, often a government official, of some certa in fact or some information that they should know about. Really, it means that the police officer isn’t going to do much of anything. He’s going to write up what ha ppened and give it to someone, but it probably won’t mean anything. It pr obably won’t lead to the police arresting the thief.

The police officer says to Vanessa, “Don’t get your  hopes up.” “To get your hopes up” means to begin to feel optimistic about s omething, to think that

something good is going to happen. Vanessa, however , knows that nothing good is going to happen, and that’s why she says to the police officer, “Believe me, I won’t.” “Believe me” is the same as “Trust me.” We use it in a circumstance like this, where you are trying to emphasize to the pers on that what you are saying is true.

What Vanessa is saying is that she won’t get her ho pes up. She knows the police officer isn’t really going to do anything to catch the thief. I was mugged once, not here in United States – in another country, many ye ars ago. Some thief came up – actually two thieves, on a public bus – and stole  my wallet, and I went to the police and they filed a report.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: Stop thief!

Police Officer: What happened?

Vanessa: I just got mugged. That guy stole my purse , jewelry, camera – all of my valuables!

Police Officer: Were you wearing flashy jewelry and  carrying an expensive camera? Those are big enticements for muggers.

Police Officer: Well, you should never go out alone  at night, and if you have to, stay in well-lighted areas. Traveling on dim street s makes you a target for thieves.

Vanessa: Thanks for that insight.

Police Officer: Can you describe the person who mug ged you?

Vanessa: No, it happened in a flash. I didn’t get a  good look at his face, but I’m sure it was a man.
