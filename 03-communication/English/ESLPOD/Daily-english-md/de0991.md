This episode is a dialogue between Sandra and Roger  that will include vocabulary we use in English to describe distances.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: Where will we be staying when we visit Trum anville?

Roger: We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the ou tskirts of the town, but a stone’s throw from some of the major sites we’ll wa nt to see.

Sandra: I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis around. Y ou know I hate to walk.

Roger: Trumanville is a very walkable city, and we’ ll be within walking distance to everything. We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere o n foot.

Sandra: I told you. I hate to walk. At least we’ll be within close proximity to the beach.

Roger: Actually, the areas near the beach are too e xpensive, and we can’t afford it. And plus, the beach is in a remote part of town , and staying there would mean being in the boonies for our entire trip.

Sandra: But we could take taxis.

Roger: Taking taxis everywhere would be really expe nsive.

Sandra: Tell me that we’ll at least be in the vicin ity of good shopping areas.

Roger: It might be a bit of a hike to the shops, bu t it won’t be too onerous to walk.

Sandra: Read my lips. I don’t want to walk everywhe re. Maybe we can rent a car or hire a driver.

Roger: Are you out of your mind?! This is supposed to be a budget vacation, not a luxury trip. I’m not made of money, you know.

Sandra: And I didn’t know you were such a cheapskat e!

Our dialogue begins with Sandra saying to Roger, “W here will we be staying when we visit Trumanville?” Sandra wants to know wh ere they are going to be staying – overnight, we assume – when they visit th is town called Trumanville. Roger says, “We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the outskirts of the town.” The “outskirts” (outskirts) are the edges of the to wn – not in the center of the town or city, but way out where the city is about t o end, basically.

Roger says they’re going to stay in a neighborhood on the outskirts of town – in an area on the outskirts of town, “but a stone’s th row from some of the major sites we’ll want to see.” The expression “a stone’s  throw” is a somewhat old one to describe a distance that is very small. Somethin g that is very close, something that is nearby, could be described as being “a ston e’s throw” from where you are, or “a stone’s throw away.” A “stone” is a rock, so if you think of how far you can throw a rock – and most of us can’t throw a rock ve ry far – that gives you an idea of why we use that expression for something very cl ose.

Sandra says, “I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis aro und. You know I hate to walk.” Sandra is hoping there’ll be a lot of taxicabs that  they can take so she doesn’t have to walk very much. Roger says, however, “Truma nville is a very walkable city.” When we call a place or a city “walkable” (w alkable), we mean the city is small enough so that you can walk from one place to  another. You don’t need to take a car. Los Angeles is not considered a very wa lkable city because everything is spread out. Everything is far away fr om the next thing you want to go to.

A place like New York City, however, is typically m ore walkable, meaning you can find all the things you want just by walking ar ound. You don’t have to take a car to get to, say, a grocery store or the museum. Trumanville, according to Roger, is a very walkable city. He says, “We’ll be within walking distance to everything.” “Walking distance” is the distance tha t you can walk. Of course,

everybody has a different tolerance for walking. for some people, walking distance could be a mile. For some people, like me,  it’s more like a hundred meters.

Roger says, “We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere on foot.” “On foot” just means by walking, by using your feet. Sandra says, “I tol d you. I hate to walk.” Roger doesn’t apparently understand, and so Sandra is try ing to be very clear with him. She says, “I told you,” which is something you migh t say to someone who you are perhaps a little angry with because the person doesn’t seem to understand something you have already told them.

Sandra says, “At least we’ll be within close proxim ity to the beach.” “To be within close proximity (proximity) to” something is to be close to something, to be near something. It’s just another way of saying nearby. Roger says, “Actually, the areas near the beach are too expensive.” Roger is s aying that if they plan on staying near the beach, in a hotel or area near the  beach, it will be very expensive. It will cost a lot of money. Roger says,  “We can’t afford it,” meaning we don’t have enough money. We can’t afford it.

“And plus,” meaning additionally, “the beach is in a remote part of town.” “Remote” (remote) means far away from everything el se, very difficult to reach or to get to. Roger says the beach is in a remote part  of Trumanville, “and staying there would mean being in the boonies for our entir e trip.” The expression “the boonies” (boonies) refers to a very rural, undevelo ped part of a state or a country, away from the city, away from where most p eople are. The term “the boonies” is an insulting one to describe the place that is far away from civilization, if you will – far away from where mos t people are.

Sandra says, “But we could take taxis.” Roger says,  “Taking taxis everywhere would be really expensive.” Sandra says, “Tell me t hat we’ll at least be in the vicinity of good shopping areas.” Sandra wants to b e able to take taxicabs, and Roger says that’s going to be too expensive. So, Sa ndra then says, “Tell me” – meaning please tell me – “that we will at least be in the vicinity of good shopping areas.” “Tell me” here is really used to mean, then , “this better be true,” or “I hope it is true.”

Sandra hopes that they will be “in the vicinity” (v icinity) of good shopping areas. “To be in the vicinity of” something is to be near something. It’s just another way of saying nearby. Sandra wants to be in the vicinit y of “good shopping areas” – places where she can go and buy things. Roger says,  “It might be a bit of a hike to the shops, but it won’t be too onerous to walk.”  “A bit of a hike” (hike) means a somewhat long distance. If someone says, “It’s a bi t of a hike,” they mean you

can walk there, but it’s going to take a while to w alk there. It’s going to take a long time to get there.

The verb “to hike” (hike) means to walk, but typica lly to walk a long distance and often to walk in areas that are outside of the city , such as a park. Here, it’s used as a noun – a “hike” – to mean a distance that you can walk. Roger says that it might be a bit of a hike to the shops, to the store s, “but it won’t be too onerous to walk.” “Onerous” (onerous) means very difficult, re quiring a lot of energy and effort. Roger says it will not be too onerous to wa lk; it won’t be too difficult.

Sandra again is not very happy with Roger, and she uses an expression that indicates that she’s not happy and that she believe s Roger is not paying attention to what she’s saying. She says, “Read my lips. I do n’t want to walk everywhere.” “Read my lips” is a phrase that you use when you ar e unhappy, perhaps, with someone and want them to pay very close attention t o what you are about to say. It’s another way of saying, “Pay close attention to  what I’m about to tell you.”

The phrase “read my lips” became quite popular afte r George H. W. Bush, the first Bush, used it to tell people that he wasn’t g oing to raise taxes. He said “Read my lips. No new taxes.” He wasn’t going to increase  the amount of taxes that the federal government would have. After he was elected , what happened? Well, he raised taxes. He wasn’t elected a second time.

Back to our story, however. Sandra says, “Read my l ips. I don’t want to walk everywhere. Maybe we can rent a car or hire a drive r.” “To hire a driver” would be to pay someone to drive you around in their car. Ro ger says, “Are you out of your mind?” The phrase “to be out of your mind” means to  be crazy, to not be thinking rationally or logically.

Roger says, “This is supposed to be a budget vacati on, not a luxury trip. I’m not made of money, you know.” A “budget vacation” would  be a vacation that doesn’t cost very much money. A “luxury (luxury) trip” woul d be a trip that does cost a lot of money – a very expensive vacation. Roger tells S andra, “I’m not made of money,” meaning I don’t have a lot of money. We use  this expression when we don’t have a lot of money to spend and somebody wan ts us to spend a lot of money.

Sandra says, “And I didn’t know you were such a che apskate.” “To be a cheapskate” (cheapskate) is to be a person who does n’t like to spend a lot of money. To be a cheap person is to be a cheapskate. “To be cheap” means you don’t like spending money. You don’t like spending money even in cases where you probably should spend money. That’s the idea. T he word “cheapskate” is an

insulting adjective to describe a person who doesn’ t like to spend very much money, and that’s what Sandra is doing here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
