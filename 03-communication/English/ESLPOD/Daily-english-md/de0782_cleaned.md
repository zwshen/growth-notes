This episode is a dialogue about “bitter feelings,”  about being angry at someone else.  Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Laurent:  I’m done with women!  They’re liars and m anipulators.   

Julie:  Let me guess.  You’ve had a bad breakup? 

Laurent:  It wasn’t just bad.  It was monumentally awful.  I’m never going to date again. 

Julie:  You’re just feeling bitter right now, but y ou’ll get over it.  You won’t always feel so jaded.  Wait a second.  Did you break up wi th Brittany? 

Laurent:  Yeah, I’ve told you about her before. 

Julie:  I remember.  Don’t you guys have an on-agai n, off-again relationship?  I mean haven’t you guys broken up before?   

Laurent:  Yeah, but this was the absolute end.  We’ re not getting back together. 

Julie:  But didn’t you say that three months ago?  Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation. 

Laurent:  Absolutely not!  Brittany walked all over  me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings.  I’ll never talk to her again.  As far as I’m concerned, she’s persona non grata! 

[Phone rings] 

Julie:  Hello.  Oh hi, Brittany.  Yes, he’s here.  It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to you.  Do you want to talk to her?   

Laurent:  Yes…no…yes!  Oh, give me that phone!

Our dialogue begins with Laurent – his name is Fren ch, I know I have a terrible French accent – Laurent says, “I’m done with women! ”  “To be done with (something or someone)” means you don’t want to be involved or have anything to do with that thing, or in this case, people.  La urent says he’s done with women, “They’re liars and manipulators.”  “To lie” means n ot to tell truth.  “To be a liar” (liar) is to be a person who does not tell the trut h.  Laurent thinks that women are liars and manipulators.  A “manipulator” is someone  who manipulates.  “To manipulate” means to control another person by tric king or fooling them.  It’s not an obvious sort of thing; it’s what we might call a  “subtle” thing.  “To manipulate (someone)” is to get them to do something for you t hat you want done.  A “manipulator” would be a person who manipulates oth er people. 

So women are liars and manipulators, at least that’ s what Laurent thinks.  Julie says, “Let me guess.  You’ve had (or you have had) a bad breakup?”  A “breakup” (one word) is when a romantic relationshi p ends, when two people decide they are not going to be romantically involv ed with each other anymore. How sad.  Poor Laurent!  He says, “It wasn’t just b ad.  It was monumentally awful.”  He’s saying it was worse than bad.  “Awful ” is the same as terrible, very bad.  “Monumentally” is here used to mean extremely , in a big way, or simply very much.  He says, “I’m never going to date again .”  And Julie says, “You’re just feeling bitter right now, but you’ll get over it.”  “Bitter” (bitter) here means feeling that something was unfair or something was wrong.  Perhaps someone did something wrong to you or you were hurt in some  way, and now you don’t want to forgive the other person.  You don’t want t o forget how hurt you were. “Bitter” has some other meanings in English as well ; take a look at our Learning Guide for those. 

Julie says that Laurent is just feeling bitter, but  he’ll get over it.  “To get over (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to no longer  be mad or upset over something, to recover, to feel better, and no longe r be so angry.  Julie says, “You won’t always feel so jaded.”  “Jaded” (jaded) usual ly is when you have a lot of experience with something and it no longer interest s you, it bores you, you’re no longer enthusiastic about it.  I’m not sure if that ’s Laurent’s problem; I’m not sure  

if that’s the right word to describe how he’s feeli ng.  Julie, I think, means that he’s feeling depressed, which I suppose could be related  to being jaded.   

Anyway, Julie says, “Wait a second.  Did you break up with Brittany?”  Laurent says, “Yes, I’ve told you about her before.”  Julie  says, “I remember.  Don’t you guys have an on-again, off-again relationship?”  “O n-again, off-again” means that sometimes you do it and sometimes you don’t.  That is, sometimes you, perhaps, are girlfriend and boyfriend, and then other times you’re not.  A “relationship” is obviously an association or connection or involveme nt with another person.  So, an on-again, off-again relationship would be one wh ere you are romantically involved, and then you breakup, and then you get ba ck together again, and so forth.  Julie says, “I mean haven’t you guys broken  up before?”   

Laurent says, “Yeah, but this was the absolute end. ”  “Absolute” (absolute) here means definite or definitive, without any doubt, wi thout any question.  This is the end, that’s what Laurent is saying.  He says, “We’r e not getting back together.” “To get back together with (someone)” would be to e nd a romantic relationship, to have a breakup, and then to start the romantic r elationship again two months later or a week later or whenever. 

So Laurent says that he and Brittany are not going to get back together again, but Julie says, “But didn’t you say that three mont hs ago?” meaning you’ve promised before that you weren’t going to get back together again.  “Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation.”  “Recon ciliation” is when two people, or two organizations even, have some sort of disagreem ent and separation. “Reconciliation” tries to bring them back together again, usually it’s in a romantic relationship. 

Laurent says, “Absolutely not (no)!  Brittany walke d all over me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings.”  “To walk all over (so meone)” is to take advantage of another person, to use the other person for what yo u want and not care about that person.  Well, Laurent says that Brittany walk ed all over him and didn’t care one iota about his feelings.  “Iota” (iota) is a ve ry small amount of something; here, it means almost nothing.  She didn’t care at all about his feelings.  He says, “I’ll never talk to her again.  As far as I’m conce rned, she’s persona non grata!” “Persona non grata” is a Latin expression; it means  that person is not welcome here.  You will not talk to them, you will not let them in your house, you don’t want them in any way. 

Then, suddenly, the phone rings, and Julie answers the phone.  She says, “Hello. Oh hi, Brittany.”  Brittany is calling on the telep hone.  Julie then says, “Yes, he’s here,” because Brittany has asked Julie if Laurent is here.  Julie then says to  

Laurent, “It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to yo u.  Do you want to talk to her?” Of course, we know that he just said he didn’t want  to talk to her anymore, but of course he says yes.  “Yes…no…yes!” he says, “Oh, gi ve me that phone!”  Let me talk to her on the phone. 

So, that’s what happens to some men.  They never le arn their lesson, and they continue to go back and back and back again.  Of co urse, maybe Laurent is in love, or maybe he’s just not very intelligent.  Som etimes love can make you stupid! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue]
