This episode is a dialogue between Cameron and Jame s.  It’s all about buying TV programs and movies to watch at home.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Cameron:  What did you get for Christmas?

James:  I got a box set of my favorite TV show of a ll time, the McQ Files.  It contains all five seasons of the show, deleted scen es, and outtakes.  I can’t wait to watch it all!

Cameron:  Didn’t you see the entire series when it was shown on TV?

James:  I did, but the bonus features make it a mus t-have for a big fan like me.

Cameron:  I just don’t see why people spend good mo ney buying shows they’ve already seen.

James:  Hey, wait a second.  Didn’t you run out and  buy the Podinator trilogy box set when it went on sale last month?

Cameron:  Uh, yeah, but that’s different.  Those are movies, not TV shows.  The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and commen tary, not to mention never- before-released scenes.

James:  Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters?

Cameron:  Yes, but…

James:  And don’t you own all three movies on video  already?

Cameron:  Well, maybe I do but…

James:  Then I don’t see why you needed to buy the box set.  I think it’s best that you give it to me.

Cameron:  Touché.

Cameron begins by asking James, “What did you get f or Christmas?”  What gifts; what presents did you get for Christmas?  James say s, “I got a box set of my favorite TV show of all time, the McQ Files.”  A “b ox set” is a group of related CDs (compact discs), DVDs, videotapes, books, or so me other material, usually a video or a print material that is sold together.  For example, you might want to see all three of the Godfather  movies from the early 70s: The Godfather , The Godfather II , The Godfather III .  Well, you can buy a box set of those three movies.  They come together in DVD form in a little  box that often contains other information about whatever it is that you’re buying .

James got a box set of his favorite TV show of all time.  The expression “of all time” means the same as ever, throughout the existe nce of something.  If you say, “This is the best book of all time,” you mean there has never been a better book than this one.  James says that the box set co ntains all five seasons of the show, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  The verb “to c ontain” means to have, to include as part of something.  “My book contains a lot of violence.”  It has a lot of violence in it.  “Contain” has a couple of differen t meanings, and those can be found in our Learning Guide.

James says that the box set contains all five seaso ns of the show – of the TV program.  A “season,” when we are talking about a t elevision program, is the group of programs that are shown usually in a perio d of six to eight months.  In the United States, typically most of the new TV sho ws begin in September.  And then, during this summer, they don’t have the show on the air.  That is, you can’t watch it on television or you can only watch old ep isodes, and then they start a new season in the fall, in September the following year.

Well, this show, the McQ Files, has five seasons.  The box set also contains deleted scenes and outtakes.  When you buy a DVD, f or example, of a TV program or a movie often they will include on the D VD things that were not part of the original movie or the original television sh ow.  Something that is “deleted”

is something that is removed.  So, “deleted scenes”  are parts of the story that were taken out for the final version, for what you saw on TV.  But when you buy the box set you get to see some of these scenes – s ome of these parts of the TV show or movie that no one else has seen.  Well, no one else who has not bought the box set!  An “outtake” (outtake – one word) is a small section of a movie that is usually removed because there was a problem with  it, often there’s a mistake. In many box set DVDs you’ll find outtakes from a mo vie that are funny, when the actors or actresses make a mistake.  That’s typical ly what outtakes are.

James says that he can’t wait to watch it all – wat ch all of the programs in this TV series.  Cameron says, “Didn’t you see the entire s eries when it was shown on TV?”  That is, when you could watch it on the regul ar television.  James said, “I did, but the bonus features make it a must-have for  a big fan like me.” Something that is a “bonus” (bonus) is something th at is extra.  A “feature” in this case is just a characteristic of something, some pa rt of something.  So, a “bonus feature” are things that you get extra when you buy  the DVD box set.  A “must- have” is something that you want and feel that you absolutely need to have. James says that getting the box set with the bonus features is a must-have for a “big fan” – that is, someone who likes this TV seri es a lot – like me.

Cameron says, “I just don’t see why people spend go od money buying shows they’ve already seen.”  The expression “to spend go od money” is an informal one that’s used to show your disapproval, how you don’t  like the way someone is choosing to spend their money.  You think it’s on u nimportant or unnecessary things.  Some people might say, “You shouldn’t spen d good money on buying a fancy car.  All you need is something that will tak e you from here to there.”  That would be an example of using this expression “to sp end good money.”  I, for example, will not spend good money on some expensiv e shampoo, since I don’t really need it!

Cameron doesn’t think James should spend good money  on buying television shows – DVDs of shows he’s already seen.  James say s, “Hey, wait a second. Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy bo x set when it went on sale last month?”  “Wait a second” means hold on; stop; don’t  go any farther.  James asks Cameron, “Didn’t you run out and buy,” meaning you were very excited and so you went to the store immediately, as soon as it wa s available to buy it.  “Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy box set?”   A “trilogy” (trilogy) is a group of three related books or movies typically.  The Lo rd of the Rings  was a trilogy; The Godfather  series was a trilogy, and so forth

Cameron says, “Uh, yeah, but that’s different.  Tho se are movies, not TV shows. The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and co mmentary, not to mention

never-before-released scenes.”  When you buy a movi e on DVD sometimes they will include a special version of the movie called the “director’s cut.”  The “director” is the person who is in charge of the mo vie when it is being filmed. Often, the director takes things out of the movie in order to be able to sell it to the movie companies – the movie studios.  When they hav e a chance to sell the DVD, then the director will often put in that origi nal cut – that is, that original version of the movie.  Often, movies will have “com mentary.”  That is, there’ll be the director, maybe the producer, possibly the lead  actor talking through the movie, giving you descriptions of what was happenin g or giving you the story behind this particular part of the movie.  And, whe n you buy a DVD with commentary you can turn the commentary on so that y ou can hear them talking literally over the movie.  “Never-before-released” means that it has not been shown to anyone until now.  It’s sort of like delet ed scenes.  “Release” has a couple of different meanings however; take a look a t the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

James says, “Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters (in the movie theater)?”  Cameron says, “Y es, but…”  “And don’t you own all three movies on video already?”  That is, C ameron already has copies of this movie, perhaps on an old videocassette tape.  Cameron says, “Well, maybe I do but…”  James continues, “Then I don’t see why yo u needed to buy the box set.  I think it’s best that you give it to me.”  H e’s joking, of course.  James is saying you should give me the box set because you a lready own these three movies.  Cameron, of course, realizes that James is  criticizing her for the same reason that she criticized him.  So the last word of the dialogue is “Touché.” “Touché” (touché – with an accent over it) is a Fre nch word that in English we use to show that you agree with what another person  has said, and that there’s something somewhat funny about it.  We’re acknowled ging that the other person said something that was true and that perhaps we di dn’t realize until they said it. For example, someone could say to you, “If you are trying to save money, why don’t you stop buying so many expensive books (book s that cost a lot of money) about saving money?”  And, you would say, “Ah, touc hé.”  In other words, you are accepting, in a sense, this criticism – this ob servation about something that is somewhat funny, something that perhaps shows that y ou didn’t think about the situation as completely as you should have.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
