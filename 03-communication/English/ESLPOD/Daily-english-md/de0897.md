This episode is a dialog between Rachel and Emeril about cooking something to eat. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Emeril: Can you hand me that pan? 

Rachel: This pot?  

Emeril: No, that pan over there. I need to pan-fry these vegetables.  

Rachel: Wouldn’t be healthier if we steamed the veg etables or grilled them? 

Emeril: Maybe, but for this meal, I’m frying them i n this pan. 

Rachel: Okay, do you want me to heat this sauce in this saucepan? 

Emeril: No, I’m going to microwave that right befor e I serve it. 

Rachel: Have you considered simmering it in a sauce pan to get a better consistency? 

Emeril: We don’t have time for that. Slice this mea t and marinade it before I broil it. 

Rachel: Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperatu re so that the meat won’t get dried out. 

Emeril: We’ll try that another time. Can you get th at cutting board and chop these carrots and dice these onions? 

Rachel: Sure, but don’t you think...? 

Emeril: What I think is that there will be six hung ry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. You’re  here to help, right? 

Rachel: Yes, of course. That’s exactly what I was t rying to do. 

[end of dialog] 

Emeril begins by saying to Rachel, “Can you hand me  that pan?” “To hand (hand)” someone something means to give it to them with your hand. A “pan” (pan) is a metal object with a round bottom that we  use to cook food on what we call a “stove.” A “stove” (stove) is where you have  a small fire or heat that comes from below, and you put something on top of that he at in order to cook it. Usually, on a stove, we use what's called a pan.  

Rachel is a little confused. She says, “This pot?” A “pot” (pot) is a kind of pan, but it's got very long sides so that it holds a lot of liquid, a lot of water. If you're going to make soup, you would use a pot. If you are going  to make some eggs, fry some eggs, you would use a pan.  

Emeril says, “No, that pot over there. I need to pa n-fry these vegetables.” “To pan-fry” (fry) means to cook something with a littl e bit of oil in the pan over a very high heat. Rachel says, “Wouldn't it be healthier” – wouldn't it be better for your body – “if we steamed the vegetables or grilled the m?” Emeril wants to fry the vegetables in a pan with oil. Rachel wants to steam  or grill the vegetables. “To steam” (steam) means to cook something, especially vegetables, not in water, but in water vapor. So what happens is you have wat er that's boiling, that's very hot, and it's giving off heat. It's giving off wate r vapor, and you use the heat from that vapor to cook the food. You don't put the food  in the water. You don't put the food on a metal object like a pan.  

“To grill” (grill) means to take the food and put i t over an open fire, so that the food isn't directly on a pan. It's on a piece of me tal that is over the heat source, is over the fire, in this case. You can grill lots of different kinds of food. We often associate grilling food with cooking food outside o ver an open fire, over a source of heat.  

Emeril says, “Maybe” – maybe we could steam or gril l the vegetables – “but for this meal, I'm frying them in a pan.” Emeril is not  going to change his mind. He doesn't want to steam the vegetables over water. He  doesn't want to grill them  

directly over the heat. He wants to pan fry them, p ut them into metal object called a “pan” and put that over the heat and add a little  oil.  

Rachel says, “Okay. Do you want me to heat this sau ce in this saucepan?” “To heat” means to make hot, to warm something up. A “s aucepan” is a small pot that you use, typically, for making what are called  “sauces,” which is a liquid that you would eat with your food. That’s a saucepan. It 's not big enough, for example, to make pasta in, but you can put water or  other liquid in a saucepan. It's a small pot that you can use to make other kin ds of food.  

Emeril says, “No.” No, he doesn't want Rachel to he at the sauce in a saucepan. He says, “I'm going to microwave that right before I use it.” “To microwave,” as a verb, means to cook something in a kitchen applianc e called a microwave oven. It's a special kind of oven that cooks using, you g uessed it, microwaves. Almost every American home, every American kitchen, has a microwave oven. They're very, very common here.  

Rachel says, “Have you considered” – have you thoug ht about – simmering it in a sauce pan to get a better consistency?” “To simme r” (simmer) means to boil something but at a very medium heat, not too high o f a heat – “to simmer.” Usually, you simmer a liquid over a long period of time in order to get a better taste from it. Rachel is asking Emeril if he has th ought about simmering this sauce, this liquid he's making, in order to get a b etter consistency. “Consistency,” when we’re talking about food, is how thick or thin  or smooth the food is. For example, you can have a soup that has a very thin c onsistency. You can have a soup that has a thick consistency. A thick consiste ncy would be heavier. It would feel like there was more in your mouth if you took a spoonful and put it in your mouth.  

Emeril who’s not very interested, obviously, in Rac hel's opinions, says “No. We don't have time for that. Slice this meat and marin ate it before I broil it.” “To slice” (slice) means to cut with a knife, typically to cut  food, usually in thin pieces. Americans typically buy bread that has already been  “sliced.” It's already been cut by a machine. “To slice,” then, means to cut.  

Emeril is asking Rachel to slice this meat and mari nade it. “To marinade” (marinade) means to place a piece of meat or some v egetables usually in some sort of liquid for a long period of time so that th e meat or the vegetables has a better flavor, a better taste. “Marinade” can also be a noun meaning that liquid you use to give it a better taste. Emeril wants Rac hel to marinate the meat before he broils it. “To broil” (broil) means to cook the outside of some food by putting it directly close to the flame, or the fire, or the he at source. It's similar to grilling, but  

by broiling, at least in an American oven, is often  done on the very bottom of the oven. There's a separate section called a broiler a nd the heat source is usually above the food, and you put the food in underneath the heat to cook it. “Grilling” – you’re typically putting the meat or the food ove r the open flame, on top of the heat. 

Rachel, who still wants to give her opinion, says, “Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperature so that the meat won't get dried out.” “To bake” (bake) means to cook something inside of an oven, surrounded by hot air. Rachel wants to bake the meat so that it won't get dried out. “To b e dried (dried) out” means that most or all of the liquid has left the food and it doesn't taste very good. It tastes dry. It tastes hard, not like it should.  

Emeril says, “We’ll try that another time,” meaning  we’ll try that in the future someday. He's not interested in Rachel's opinion, a s I mentioned earlier. He tells her, “Can you get that cutting board and chop these  carrots and dice these onions?” A “cutting board” is a flat rectangular or  square piece of wood or plastic that you use to cut on. If you're going to be cutti ng something, you don't want to hurt or damage your kitchen, the tops of your what we would call “counters” in your kitchen – the space that you have to prepare y our food. So, you use a cutting board, a piece of wood or plastic you put u nderneath the food in order to cut it. Emeril wants Rachel to use a cutting board and chop carrots. “To chop” (chop) means to cut, usually a fruit or a vegetable  into smaller pieces. “To dice” (dice) means also, to cut fruit or vegetables into small pieces but even smaller than chopping. So, chopping, you’re cutting the foo d, the vegetables or the fruit, into large pieces. Dicing means to cut them into ve ry small pieces.  

Rachel says, “Sure, but don't you think…” She wants  to offer another opinion. Emeril says, “What I think is that there will be si x hungry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. Y ou're here to help, right?” Rachel says, “Yes, of course. That's exactly what I  was trying to do.” Emeril is getting a little impatient with Rachel. He's tellin g her that she should stop offering her opinions and just do what Emeril says.  

Emeril obviously has never been married.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed
