This episode is a dialogue between Zuly and Danny a bout when you buy “furniture” – a bed, a couch, a chair – and the com pany or store delivers it to your house.  We’ll see what happens when there are some problems in that process. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was waiting patiently for the furniture store to deliver my new bed.  I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00.  At 4:50, the delivery truc k pulled up in front of my house. ……

Zuly:  Hello.

Danny:  Hi!  We’re from Reliable Furniture.  We’re here to deliver your new bed.

Zuly:  I thought you’d never get here.  The new bed  should go in the bedroom. Follow me.  You’ll haul away the old bed, right?

Danny:  We will for an extra charge.

Zuly:  I thought that was included in the price of the new bed.

Danny:  Let me check the paperwork.  Oh, I guess it  is.  We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one.

Zuly:  Okay, this way.  You can bring the bed right  in here.

Danny:  Okay, here you are.  We’re all done.

Zuly:  Aren’t you guys going to remove the bubble w rap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?

Danny:  We can, but it’ll cost extra.

Zuly:  I’m sure that’s included in the price of the  new bed.

Danny:  Let me check…Okay, I guess we’ll set it up.   We’re just running a little late, that’s all.  We got a late start from the war ehouse this morning and it’s already past quitting time. ……

I wasn’t too happy, to say the least, but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything.  But as soon as they’re finished, I’ll be  ready to give them a piece of my mind!

[end of dialogue]

Zuly begins by telling us the background – the sett ing of our story.  She says, “I was waiting patiently for the furniture store (the place where she bought a piece of furniture, such as a bed, a couch, or a chair) t o deliver my new bed.”  I should say that “furniture” is always singular; we would n ever say “furnitures,” even though it refers to many different objects – many d ifferent we would say “pieces of furniture.”  She’s waiting for the store to “del iver” her bed, to take it from their store and bring it to her house.  She says, “I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00.” A “window” in this case means a period of time duri ng which something will happen.  It’s very common in the U.S. when you have  someone delivering furniture or someone coming to your house to fix yo ur telephone – for lots of different services – that the company will give you  not a specific time but a range of time, what we would call a “window.”  In this ca se, they could come any time between 1:00 and 4:00.  It’s very inconvenient for the person who is buying the service or thing, but that’s just the way a lot of companies do things here.  I always find it rather annoying.  In any case, Zuly says, “At 4:50 (meaning 50 minutes after the end of the window – 50 minutes la te), the delivery truck pulled up in front of my house.”  The “delivery truck” is the large vehicle that will deliver things.  “To pull up” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to drive to a place and stop there, especially in front a building or a hou se.  “To pull up,” it’s used with your car.

So, the truck pulled up in front of her house, and then we get the actual dialogue. Zuly says, “Hello.”  Danny, who works for the deliv ery company or the store, says, “Hi!  We’re from Reliable Furniture.  We’re h ere to deliver your new bed.”

Something that is “reliable” is something that is d ependable, that you can count on.  Of course, they’re 50 minutes late, so they’re  not actually very reliable!  Zuly says, “I thought you’d never get here.”  The expres sion “I thought you’d never get here” is one you would use to let someone know that  they are much later than you expected.  Normally it communicates a certain a nnoyance, a certain anger perhaps at that person.  Zuly says, “The new bed sh ould go in the bedroom.” That’s where beds go usually, in the bedroom.  “Fol low me,” she says, walk behind me and go where I am going, “You’ll haul awa y the old bed, right?”  “To haul (haul) away (something)” is to take something away, take something from, say, a house or a building that is very large typic ally; it may be very heavy to lift. It’s something that you don’t need anymore.  So if your refrigerator breaks and you can’t fix it, you can buy a new refrigerator an d then have your old refrigerator hauled away.  Someone will it take away.  It’s a ph rasal verb we use especially in this circumstance.

So Zuly wants to make sure the movers will haul awa y her old bed – will take her old bed away and get rid of it, throw it out or do whatever one does with old beds. Danny says, “We will (we will haul it away) for an extra charge.”  An “extra charge” is an additional amount of money.  Zuly say s, “I thought that (the hauling away) was included in the price of the new bed.”  Z uly didn’t think she had to pay extra, or additional money.  Danny says, “Let me ch eck the paperwork.”  Let me look at the paper or the forms that were given to h im with instructions about what to deliver, where, and what services are included.  “Paperwork” is a general term that describes forms, pieces of paper you have to p ut information on, we would say “to fill out.”  That’s a general term that woul d be used in businesses and government offices.  Government offices typically h ave lots of paperwork if you ever want to get anything from them!  Danny checks his paperwork and realizes that he should not charge her more money for haulin g away the old bed, so he says, “Oh, I guess it is,” it is included in the pr ice that she already paid.  “We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one,” he  says.

Zuly then says, “Okay, this way (meaning follow me;  walk after me).  You can bring the bed right in here.”  So she walks, we gue ss, from the door of the house – the front door and goes to the bedroom and shows them where to put the bed, so they bring the bed in.  Danny then says, “Okay, here you are,” meaning this is what I am giving you; it is right here.  This is a very common expression. Someone may ask you for a pen to write with.  You t ake out a pen, and as you’re giving it to the person you may say, “here you are, ” or “here you go.”  In that case, they mean the same thing.  Danny says, “We’re  all done,” we are finished; we’ve completed our job.  But Zuly doesn’t think th ey’re finished, she says, “Aren’t you guys (you men – in this case perhaps – aren’t you) going to remove the bubble wrap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?”  “Bubble wrap” are

large pieces of plastic that have been put together  and they have lots of little, well, bubbles, which are sort of like little balloo ns that have air in them, and they’re all attached, and they’re put around someth ing to protect it.  They’re often used when you are mailing, for example, something t hat could break easily.  “To assemble” means to put together, to take things tha t are apart and put them together so that whatever you have is working.  “To  set up (something)” in this case means to put something into the correct positi on, put it where it’s supposed to be.  “Set up,” as a phrasal verb, can also be us ed to mean to put something together, to organize something, to get something r eady.

Danny says, “We can (we can do that), but it’ll cos t extra.”  It’ll be an extra charge again.  Zuly again doubts this, doesn’t think this is true.  She says, “I’m sure that’s included in the price of the new bed,” meani ng I already paid for that, you should do it.  Danny looks at his paper again; he s ays, “Let me check,” and realizes that yes, they’re supposed to do the thing s that Zuly is asking them to do, to set up the bed.  He says, “Okay, I guess we’ ll set it up.  We’re just running a little late, that’s all.”  “To run a little late”  means to be behind schedule, not to have made very much progress in what you are doing.   You planned to be finished by 5:00, it’s 5:30 and you’re still not fi nished; you’re running a little late. Danny says, “We got a late start from the warehouse  this morning,” meaning we left the warehouse later than we were planning to.  A “warehouse” (warehouse – one word) is a large building where many objects or  items are stored until they are needed.  So if you go to the store to buy a bed , they won’t usually have the bed there in the store for you; they will have it i n another building, which we would call a “warehouse,” where they put things unt il they can sell them.  Danny says, “it’s already past quitting time.”  “Quitting  time” is the end of your workday: 5:00 at night, 6:00 at night.  When you finish work ing; when you go home after working, that’s “quitting time.”

Zuly says, “I wasn’t too happy, to say the least.”  The phrase “to say the least” is used to show that what you just said is an understa tement, that you actually feel much more strongly than you have indicated.  So, so meone for example wins a million dollars and they say, “Well, I’m very happy , to say the least,” meaning they’re more than just very happy.  Zuly says she w asn’t too happy – she wasn’t very happy, to say the least, meaning she was reall y angry, “but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything.”  “To be at (someone ’s) mercy” (mercy) is to be in a situation where someone else has control of what is happening, that you have to depend on another person to get something done.  It’s usually used when you’re in a situation you don’t want to be in, that  you don’t have the power that you want.  She says, “as soon as they’re finished ( as soon as Danny and his other workers finish setting up the bed), I’ll be r eady to give them a piece of my mind!”  “To give (someone) a piece of your mind” is  an expression meaning to tell

someone what you really think, especially when you’ re angry and upset, when you’re mad.  “Well, I’m going to give that guy a pi ece of my mind!”  I’m going to tell him what I really think, usually because you’r e angry.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
