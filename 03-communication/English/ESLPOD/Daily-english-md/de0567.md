This episode is about someone visiting a hospital.  It uses vocabulary that you would need in a hospital.  I hope you don’t need it, but if you do, here it is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  You’re just in time.  There’s only another 20  minutes until the end of visiting hours.

Inez:  I got here as soon as I could.  How is Uncle Peter?

George:  They moved him from the emergency ward to the intensive care unit. He’s on life support.

Inez:  How could this have happened?  How could somebody in the prime of his life collapse suddenly like that?

George:  They’ve been running tests all day, and the doct or is supposed to come by after her rounds to talk to us.  Hopefully, we’ll get  some answers then, and she’ll give us an update on Uncle Peter’s condition.  Com e on, I’ll take you to the ICU.

Inez:  Okay, but I really dread seeing him on a respirato r and hooked up to monitors.

George:  This is it, room 323.

 Inez:  Oh, look at him.  What are all of these IV drip s for?  He looks so lifeless in that hospital bed.  Is he under sedation?

George:  Yeah, I think so.  We’ll know more when the d octor gets here.  Oh, here she is.

Inez:  Let’s hope she has some answers for us.

George begins by saying to Inez, “You’re just in time.”  “In time” means before something is ending, before something is no longer possib le.  To tell someone that they are “just in time” means that a few minutes l ater, or maybe an hour later they would not be able to do what they can do now.  Ge orge says, “There’s only another 20 minutes until the end of visiting hours.”  “ Visiting hours” are times when family and friends can see and visit patients in a h ospital.  A “patient” is someone who is sick.  So, it’s the time you can go to the hospital and talk to somebody who’s there.  Every hospital has different visiting  hours.

Inez says, “I got here as soon as I could (as fast as I could ).  How is Uncle Peter?”  George says, “They moved him from the emergency w ard to the intensive care unit.”  In a hospital, the different par ts or sections of the hospital are called “wards” (wards).  For babies that are going  to be born, you go to the “maternity ward.”  That’s where they deliver babies.  Th ere was a famous novel by late Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called The Ca ncer Ward .  That would be the place in the hospital where they take care  of people who have cancer.  This is the “emergency ward,” it’s for people who  have very serious problems and need immediate attention.  The “intensive  care unit” is a special part of the hospital for people who are so sick they mig ht die soon, so that they are given extra attention (extra care; help) to make sure  they don’t.  George says that Uncle Peter is on life support.  “Life support” in a hospital are machines that keep a person alive.  Often, they allow the person to br eathe; they prevent the person from dying, if they did not have the life support  they would die.  To be on life support is to be in a very serious situation.

Inez says, “How could this have happened?  How could somebo dy in the prime of his life collapse suddenly like that?”  Inez doesn’t un derstand why Uncle Peter is sick.  She says he’s in the prime of his life.  The expressi on “the prime (prime) of (one’s) life” are the best years, the years where you  are almost always going to be healthy.  Maybe it’s between 20 and 70, depends o n the person.  I’m 46, so I’m in the prime of my life.  Uncle Peter suddenly colla psed.  “To collapse” means

 to fall down suddenly because you feel sick; you feel weak; perhaps you become unconscious, like you were sleeping.  That’s to collapse.

George says that the doctors have been “running tests” (d oing tests) all day, trying to find out what is wrong.  “The doctor,” he says,  “is supposed to come by (is supposed to visit) after her rounds to talk to us.”  “ Rounds” (rounds) are when a doctor goes and sees all of his or her patients, usually in a certain order: first they go to this ward, then they go to that ward; first they see this person, then they see that person.  It’s sort of like the plan that do ctors follow to visit all of the patients that they have.  George says, “Hopefully, we’ll g et some answers then (when the doctor comes), and she’ll give us an update (t he most recent information) on Uncle Peter’s condition (how Peter is doing).”  I should mention that the word “round” that we just talked about has seve ral different meanings in English.  If you’re member of ESL Podcast, you can find o ut what those are by going to the Learning Guide for this episode.  You can  also find other meanings of the word “condition” in that same Learning Guide.

George says, “Come on, I’ll take you to the ICU.”  The “ICU” is the intensive care unit, often called, simply, “ICU.”  Inez says, “Okay, but I  really dread seeing him on a respirator and hooked up to monitors.”  “To drea d” (dread) means not to want to do something because you are very worried or you’ re anxious about what will happen.  Uncle Peter is on a respirator.  A “resp irator” is a machine that helps you breathe by pushing oxygen into your lungs.  It allows yo u to breathe even if you can’t breathe on your own.  It’s very common when som eone is ill that they are so weak that they cannot breathe properly, and so r espirators are used to keep them alive.  Inez says Uncle Peter is hooked up to moni tors.  “To be hooked up to (something)” means to be connected to som ething.  A “monitor” is a machine, especially in a hospital, that tells you how the  person – the patient is doing: their heart rate, their blood pressure, and so  forth.

George says, “This is it,” they’ve been walking to the ICU .  “This is it,” he says, “room 323.”  Inez says, “Oh, look at him (meaning Uncle Peter).  What are all of these IV drips for?”  “IV” stands for intravenous.  “IV drip” is a clear, usually, plastic bag that is full of liquid, often with medicine  in it, and it hangs next to the patient.  It is hooked up to the patient; there’s actua lly something that goes in, usually, to the patient’s arm.  This allows, for example,  for the doctors to make sure the person keeps “hydrated,” make sure they have enoug h water.  It is also a way of giving medicine to a person who is sick.  You’ll o ften see IVs next to patients in hospitals.

 Inez then says, “He looks so lifeless in that hospital bed.”   “To be lifeless” is to be without life, basically like you’re dead.  Inez says, “Is he  under sedation?” “Sedation” is medicine that makes you very sleepy; it calms yo u down.  Often, if someone is under sedation, you can’t talk to them because they’re sleeping or they don’t respond normally to you.  George says, “Yeah, I think so.  We’ll know more when the doctor gets here.  Oh, here she is.”  Ine z then says, “Let’s hope she has some answers for us.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
