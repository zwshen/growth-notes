This episode is called “Describing Touch and Textures.”  It’s a dialogue between Tommy and Louisa that will use a lot of vocabulary related to the way things physically feel.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Tommy:  It’s just our luck that there’s a major power failure while we’re shopping in this outdoor bazaar.    Louisa:  How are we going to find our way back to the hotel?  Tommy:  Follow me and stay close.  I’ll lead the way.  Louisa:  This road is so rough.  I keep tripping over the stones.  Ah!  Tommy:  What happened?  Louisa:  I just fell into something wet and sticky.  Gross!  I don’t know what it is.  It has a weird texture.  Tommy:  Don’t think about it.  If you’re not hurt, then try to get up and keep moving.  Give me your hand.  Ugh, it’s all slimy!  Louisa:  Yeah, and my dress is all greasy, too.  You know what?  I think I did hurt myself.  My foot feels all tingly, like it’s asleep.  Tommy:  Try to walk the best you can and let’s try to make it back to the hotel.  The road is smooth, not too bumpy, on this side.  Let me help you.
