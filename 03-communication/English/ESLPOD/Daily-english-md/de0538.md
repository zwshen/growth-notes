This episode is called “Finding the Perfect Gift.”  It’s a dialogue between Fae and Pablo about someone who’s looking to find a gift.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Fae:  Help!  I still need to buy a gift for my mother  and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her socks off.

Pablo:  Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate or  a gift card?  That way, she can pick out her own gift.

Fae:  Oh, she would hate that.  She would think that I didn’t put any thought into buying her a present at all, while I’ve been racking my brain to think of something she’ll like.  Maybe I should buy her a car!

Pablo:  Now, don’t get carried away.  You get like this every year.  I know you want to please your mother, but remember, it’s the th ought that counts.

Fae:  I wish that were true.  If I get her the wrong  gift, I’m afraid she’ll be disappointed, or worse, she’ll hold it against me for the rest of my life.

Pablo:  It boggles my mind how you can work yourself up l ike this every year.

Fae:  How can I not?  You know my mother.

Pablo:  Yes, I do, and I have one piece of advice for you : Buy her a gift she can return.

 Fae says to Pablo, “Help!  I still need to buy a gift for my mother and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll real ly knock her socks off.”  A “gift” and a “present” are the same thing; it’s someth ing that you give another person.  A gift is something that you don’t expect the ot her person to give you anything in exchange for; you’re not asking the other p erson to give you any money.  Gifts and presents are always free, although it has become popular in the last few years on television to talk about how people  could get a free gift.  But all gifts – all presents are, by definition, free.  Fa e says, “I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her so cks off.”  “To knock (someone’s) socks off” is an informal expression meaning to i mpress someone very much, to do something that surprises someone but in a  good way – in a unexpected way.

Pablo says, “Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate  or a gift card?”  A “gift certificate” is a piece of paper that you buy at a store that you give to someone, and it allows that person to go to that store and use it to buy things.  A “gift card” is similar except it looks like a little credit card, and yo u are able to give that to someone and they can buy whatever they want.  Pablo says, “ That way (meaning by doing that, by buying her a gift card), sh e can pick out her own gift.” “To pick out” is a phrasal verb meaning to choose, to sele ct, to decide which of something you want.  Some people don’t like that.  In  fact, Fae says, “Oh, (her mother) would hate that.  She would think that I did n’t put any thought into buying her a present at all.”  “To put thought into (somethi ng)” means to think about something carefully, to think of all the options, to th ink what of what that person’s opinion would be, what their likes and dislikes are, and  to choose something carefully, just for that person.  A gift card or a gift certificate means that you really haven’t thought about it at all, and you just picked a store and you gave them a gift card for it.  So, many people don’t like gift card s and gift certificates, but they’re very popular.

Fae says, “I’ve been racking my brain to think of something she’ll like.”  “To rack (rack) your brain” means to spend a lot of time thinkin g about something, especially something that’s very difficult – a problem that ’s very difficult to solve. In this case, the problem is which gift Fae should buy her  mother.  “Maybe I should buy her a car,” she says.  Pablo says, “Now, don’t ge t carried away.”  “To get carried away” means to do too much of something, to take something to an extreme; we might also say “to go overboard.”  “To get ca rried away” means to do too much of something.  The verb “carry,” however, ha s many different meanings.  You know where to look, our Learning Guide,  where you can find additional explanations.

 Pablo says, “You get like this every year (meaning you get into this way of thinking every year).  I know you want to please your mothe r, but remember, it’s the thought that counts.”  “To please (someone)” means to make someone happy, someone you like, someone that you are trying to sa tisfy.  “Please” has a couple of different meanings, however; once again, take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  Pablo says, “it’s the  thought that counts.” This is an expression – a phrase we have that means even i f the person doesn’t like the gift, they will appreciate the thought that w ent behind it: the fact that you tried to find something good for them.  “It’s the tho ught that counts.”

Fae says, “I wish that were true (meaning that’s not tru e for my mother).  If I get her the wrong gift, I’m afraid she’ll be disappointe d.”  “To be disappointed” means you’re unhappy because someone didn’t do what you expected or something didn’t result in the way that you wanted it to.  Fae sa ys, “worse, she’ll hold it against me for the rest of my life.”  “To hold (some thing) against (someone)” is another phrasal verb meaning not to forgive someone for something that happened, to continue to be angry at someone for someth ing that happened in the past.  Fae thinks that her mother will be mad at h er for the rest of her life – which could be a very long time!

Pablo says, “It boggles my mind how you can work yourself up  like this every year.”  “To boggle (boggle) (someone’s) mind” means to confuse someone, to do something that is very surprising, very confusing, very difficul t for another person to understand.  It means that you’re really confused abou t something; you’re really surprised about something.  “Why my brother decided  to leave his job boggles my mind,” I’m completely confused by it.  Usually we  use this expression when we somehow disapprove or disagree with whatever the  outcome or result was.

Pablo says it boggles his mind how Fae works herself up li ke this every year. “To work yourself up” means to get very worried about som ething or to get very angry about something.  If your girlfriend decides to en d your relationship, your friend might say, “Don’t get worked up about it (don’t  get worried about it; don’t get angry about it).  There are other fish in the sea (is an expression we would use in that case).”  “There are other fish in the sea ( in the ocean)” meaning there are other women out there that you can find to be you r girlfriend – maybe!

Fae says, “How can I not (meaning how can I not work myself  up)?  You know my mother.”  Pablo says, “Yes, I do, and I have one piece  of advice for you (a piece of advice is one thing that you are recommending to  someone): Buy her a gift she can return.”  “To return” here means to take something back to the store where you bought it so that you can get something else, or they will give you the

 money was paid for the gift.  We actually have what are called “gift receipts,” which are popular, I’m sure, in other places.  These are  receipts that the store will give a person; it doesn’t have the amount of the purch ase – the amount that you paid, but it allows the person to bring back to a store to exchange it for something else.  Of course once they bring it back, then they’ll know  how much it was, so it’s kind of a silly practice really, but that is what a gi ft receipt is, when you are going to return something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
