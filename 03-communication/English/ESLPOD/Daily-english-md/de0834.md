This dialogue is between Jim and Dina. It’s all abo ut computer security – making sure that your computer does not get information st olen from it. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Jin:  Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?

Dina:  No, what?

Jin:  Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer systems and cause a lot of problems over the weekend. They dest royed data and rendered the system unusable. In fact, the entire system cra shed.

Dina:  I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?

Jin:  Well, the company announced last week that it  had implemented new security measures, which made their systems impenet rable.

Dina:  Ah, that explains it. Making an announcement  like that is like issuing a challenge.

Jin:  Yeah, it was definitely a challenge. I bet a lot hackers were trying to breach those security measures, just to show that it could  be done. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and ex ploited them.

Dina:  What was McQ Corp thinking? They’ve had prob lems in the past with hackers and then they issue this challenge. I say that it serves them right!

Jin:  They shouldn’t have bragged about their new s ecurity measures, but those hackers caused a lot of damage.

 Dina:  I bet McQ Corp learned its lesson:  Don’t wa ve a red flag in front of a bull!

Our topic on this episode is computer security. We begin with Jin saying, “Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?” “McQ Corp” is a company – a fictional company, not a real company. Dina says, “No, what?”  Jin says, “Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer sys tems.” A “hacker” (hacker) is a person who uses their computer skills to illegall y go into another website or to go into some computer software, often to steal some  secret or confidential information. The verb is “to hack” (hack). A “hacke r” is someone who hacks into a computer system. In this case, the computer system was at McQ Corp. And the hackers were able to get “unauthorized access.” “Un authorized” means not authorized. “Authorized” means you have permission – someone said, “Yes, that’s okay.” “Access” is the ability to reach some thing, to see something.

So, “unauthorized access” would be going into somew here where you don’t have permission to go. And the hackers did this with the  McQ Corp computer system and caused a lot of problems “over the weekend.” “O ver the weekend” means during this past Saturday and Sunday.

Jin says they “destroyed data and rendered the syst em unusable.” “Data” (data) means information, especially when we’re talking ab out computers or in scientific research, it’s the evidence that we use to examine our hypotheses or ideas. “Data” is technically a plural noun but it is often  used in the singular in more modern English. Jin says the hackers destroyed – th ey got rid of, they damaged – data, “rendered the system unusable.” “To render”  (render) means to put something in a particular position or to make somet hing present in a certain way. Basically, in this sentence it just means “make.” S o, they made – past tense – the system unusable. Once again, we see the prefix “un”  (un) – which means “not.” So, “unusable” means not usable, not able to be use d.

Jin says, “In fact, the entire system crashed.” “To  crash” (crash) – for a computer system or a network – means to suddenly stop workin g. If a computer crashes, it turns off, it stops working. You can’t do anything with it. This is a common problem for all computers at some time or another. Dina says, “I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?” Jin says, “Well, the company a nnounced last week, that it had implemented new security measures which made th eir systems impenetrable.” So, McQ Corp announced or told every one last week that it had implemented new security measures. “To implement” ( implement) means to begin, to officially launch or to formally start so mething. They started a new or put

into place a new security system – new security mea sures, our dialogue says. A “measure” (measure) is just a procedure or a proces s or an action. “Security” refers to keeping the computer system safe so peopl e don’t go in and steal things from it.

McQ Corp. implemented new security measures which m ade their systems “impenetrable.” We’re getting a lot of prefixes in this dialogue. One of them is “impenetrable.” The (im) is the same as (in) as a p refix and that once again, means not – just like (un). Sometimes we say (un), sometimes we say (in) – if it’s before a “p” the “n” becomes an “m” so it’s “impene trable” – not able to be penetrated is what that means. “To penetrate” means  to go into something. So, something is “impenetrable” – you’re not able to go  into it. Obviously, the hackers were able to penetrate the system and of course, th at caused all the problems.

Dina says, “Ah, that explains it. Making an announc ement like that is like issuing a challenge.” “To issue” (issue) here means to anno unce. It can also mean to give something to someone. You could say it also me ans that here too. A “challenge” is when you say to someone, “I want you  to do this,” or “I don’t think you could do this. This is a very difficult task. T his is a very difficult thing to do. I challenge you to do this!”

They’re using challenge as a verb. So, when McQ Cor p announced that it had new security measures, this was like issuing a chal lenge to the hackers. It was saying to the hackers, “See if you can break into o ur system. See if you can penetrate our security measures.” Jin says, “Yeah, it was definitely a challenge.” “I bet” – meaning I’m guessing – “a lot of hackers were trying to breach those security measures.” “To breach” (breach) means to b reak a rule or to go past some limit that you’re not supposed to go past. In this case, it means to get into the computer, to get around the security measures s o they can get into the computer.

Jin says, “They were trying to breach those securit y measures just to show that it could be done.” “Just to show” here means only to d emonstrate, only to let everyone know that the security measures were not a s good as the McQ Corp thought they were. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and exploited them. “One of them,” meaning one of the h ackers – found the system’s “vulnerabilities.” “Vulnerability” (vulnerability) is a weakness. If you are vulnerable, you are weak. There’s something about y ou that someone could beat you with or take advantage of you with. And the hac ker found the system’s vulnerabilities and “exploited them.” “To exploit” (exploit) means to use something to your advantage, which causes problems for someone else. It’s

good for you but it is hurting or harming someone e lse – that’s to exploit something or someone.

Dina says, “What was McQ Corp. thinking?” “What wer e they thinking?” means I can’t believe they were so stupid – that’s really w hat that question means. Dina says, “They’ve had problems in the past with hacker s and then they issue this challenge. I say, that it serves them right.” That’ s a common expression, “to serve (serve) someone right (right).” “To serve som eone right” means that the person got what they deserved. It’s used in a negat ive way when talking about the bad or negative results or consequences of some thing that someone has done. So, if you are driving fast down the freeway,  above the speed limit and the police catch you and give you a ticket – a fine – “ It serves you right,” I could say. You were doing something bad and now you have to fa ce or deal with the negative consequences.

Jin says, “They shouldn’t have bragged about their new security measures. But those hackers caused a lot of damage.” “To brag” (b rag) – means to tell everyone how good you are. “Oh, I’m the best tennis  player in Southern California.” “I’m the best singer in Hollywood.” Of  course, when you brag it’s not always true. Well, Jin says that McQ Corp. should n ot have bragged. They shouldn’t have said that their system was impenetra ble. Dina says, “I bet McQ Corp. learned its lesson.” “To learn its lesson” me ans they have learned from their mistake and they won’t do it again. Dina says , “The lesson is, don’t wave a red flag in front of a bull.” A “bull” (bull) is a large animal that traditionally, in countries like Spain and Mexico and a few other pla ces, is used in bull fighting, which is you fight against the bull. Not sure if th ey still do this in Spain. I know they still do it in Mexico, I believe.

“Bull fighting” is when you have a huge animal – th is huge bull – and a man gets in a circle with the bull, and basically tries to k ill the bull. The tradition is that if you have a red flag – a small piece of cloth, a sma ll piece of material – and you “wave it,” meaning you move it back and forth in fr ont of the bull, that this will cause the bull to get angry and to try to run at yo u. Now, I believe it’s also the case that bulls are actually colorblind so the colo r red doesn’t really have any special effect. But that’s the expression – to wave  a red flag in front of a bull. It means to make other people angry without any good r eason. You’re trying to make them angry and that’s what Dina says the McQ C orp. did with its computer system.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
