[start of dialogue]

Bill: Ma’am! Ma’am!

Estelle: Yes?

Bill: Ma’am, you’re not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you’re not allowed. Please don’t step on that scaffolding.  It’s dangerous.

Estelle: Oh, I just wanted a quick look to see how the building is coming along. Look at all this lumber and brick. The foundation is already done and the beams and rafters are going up. This is so exciting!

Bill: Ma’am, this is a dangerous area, especially f or someone not wearing a hard hat.

Estelle: I won’t stay very long. I just wanted to s ee the progress.

Bill: Watch out!

Estelle: Oh, I almost tripped over these pickaxes a nd shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.

Bill: You’re welcome. Now let me escort you off the  site.

Estelle: But I wanted to see that bulldozer and cra ne over there.

Bill: You can see them just fine from the street. A nd from the street you won’t be my responsibility!

[end of dialogue]

Bill begins our dialogue by shouting to Estelle, “M a’am! Ma’am!” The expression “Ma'am” (Ma’am) is a way of getting the attention of a woman, an adult woman. It's not as common anymore, though you may still he ar it in certain formal circumstances, especially when you don't know the w oman very well. Bill doesn't know Estelle at all, and that's why he is addressin g her or referring to her as “Ma'am.” He's trying to get her attention.

In this case, Estelle says, “Yes?” Bill then says, “Ma’am, you're not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you're not  allowed.” A “construction site” is a place where they are building a new building. It could be a house. It could be an office building. It could be any kind of structu re. Bill says that Estelle is not allowed, meaning she is not supposed to be there.

He then says, “Please don't step on” – or put your foot on – “that scaffolding.” “Scaffolding” (scaffolding) is a temporary structur e that is made typically from metal and wood that is used to help the people buil ding the building get up to a higher level. You can almost think of it as a ladde r, but a ladder is something that just leans up against something. It doesn't stand b y itself. “Scaffolding” stands by itself and is used to allow the workers to go up to  a higher level, especially when they're building a house or building that is more t han one level – more than one “floor,” we might say.

Estelle says, “Oh, I just wanted a quick look to se e how the building is coming along.” “To come along” is a phrasal verb meaning to advance, to progress, to move forward. “How are you coming along on your hom ework?” a parent might ask a child. That means “How are you progressing? H ow are you doing? How much progress have you made?” Estelle wanted to see  how the building was coming along.

She then says, “Look at all this lumber and brick.”  “Look at all this” means look at this – look at all of what I am pointing to. In this case, Estelle is pointing to “lumber” (lumber) and “brick” (brick). “Lumber” is wood that has been cut to a specific size in order to use it to build something . If you are building a house or a building and you are making it out of wood, at leas t in part, you will need lumber. These pieces of wood are often referred to by their  sizes – by the height and width of the wood. You may hear someone talk about a “two by four.” That's a piece of wood in the shape of a rectangle, two inch es by four inches.

 “Brick” (brick) are small rectangular blocks. Often  they are a dark red color. They are typically made from clay and are used to build walls and other parts of the house. In the old days, many years ago, in certain parts of the U.S. you would see a lot of brick buildings. Nowadays it's not as common, probably because wood is cheaper and easier to work with. But you wi ll still see some parts of houses that use brick.

Estelle says, “The foundation is already done” – is  already finished or completed – “and the beams and rafters are going up.” “This is so exciting!” she says. The “foundation” (foundation) is the part of the buildi ng that touches the ground. It's the first thing you have to put in if you are going  to build a building. It's what you build the building on top of. You don't just put the pieces of wood into the dirt. You first, especially if you are building a house o r a large building, have to lay a foundation.

Notice we use the verb “to lay” (lay). “To lay a fo undation” means to put usually concrete or some sort of stone on the ground, and u sually underneath the ground, to support the house, to support the weight  of the house. “Beams” (beams) are long, straight pieces of wood or metal that are used to support the wall or the roof of a building. “Rafters” (rafters)  refer to one of several long pieces of wood that are placed at an angle on top of the w alls to support the roof above. So, the rafters help support the top of the house o r the building, which we call the “roof” (roof).

Bill says, “Ma'am, this is a dangerous area, especi ally for someone not wearing a hard hat.” A “hard hat” is just what it sounds like  – a hat that you wear that's large and heavy that protects your head in case something  heavy falls on your head. Of course, if a 16-ton weight falls on you, even a hard hat will not protect you, but it will protect you from smaller things falling on you. Estelle says, “I won't stay very long” – I won't remain here very long. “I just  wanted to see the progress.”

Bill then yells, “Watch out!” “Watch out” is a phra sal verb meaning be careful. It's used to warn someone about some danger, something that might hurt them. If you say, “Watch out,” you mean that that person mig ht get hit with something within the next second or five seconds. So, it's a way of warning someone that there is some danger. You could also say “watch out ” if someone is walking and doesn't see a hole that is in front of them and mig ht hurt themselves by falling down into the hole. That would also be a case of sa ying, “Watch out!”

In general conversation, people say “watch out” as a way of saying you need to be careful about this person or you need to be care ful about this situation. It's not

necessarily a case of you being in physical danger,  but you might have problems in other areas. And so, we might use that expressio n “watch out” in that case as well. Estelle says, “Oh, I almost tripped over” – o r fell over – “these pickaxes and shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.”

A “pickaxe” (pickaxe) is a large, heavy tool with a  wooden handle – the handle is what you grab onto with your hands – and a large pi ece of metal at the other end. This large piece of metal has two sharp ends on it.  The tool is used to make a hole in something very heavy, like a piece of rock or some part of the earth, the ground. A “shovel” (shovel) is a tool that also has  a long wooden handle, but at the end has a slightly curved piece of metal that is used to go into the ground – to dig into the ground – and remove dirt or remove wha tever you are trying to get out of the way. A “shovel” is used very often in or der to dig a hole.

A “wheelbarrow” (wheelbarrow) – one word – is basic ally a little car or cart. It typically has just one wheel on the front. On the b ack are two legs made of wood or metal that you can rest on. But basically you pu sh it on one wheel.  It's used to carry heavy objects, or a lot of stone, or a lot of  earth that needs to be moved from one place to another. When I say it is used to  move those things, I mean it's used to move them a short distance. If you are goin g to move something a long distance, you wouldn't use a wheelbarrow. You'd pro bably use a truck. A wheelbarrow is small. It won't contain that much ma terial, anyway.

Bill says, “You're welcome” after Estelle thanks hi m for saving her. He says, “Now let me escort you off the site.” “To escort” ( escort) someone means to take someone somewhere, to accompany someone to a place.  In this case, Bill wants to escort Estelle off the construction site. He wan ts to take her away from the construction site so she doesn't get hurt.

Estelle says, “But I wanted to see that bulldozer a nd crane over there.” A “bulldozer” (bulldozer) is a large vehicle that has  a piece of metal connected to it that can be raised and lowered. It's often used to push or move a large amount of dirt or rocks. A “crane” (crane) is also a large ma chine used to move heavy objects, but a crane is a very tall machine that pi cks things up and moves them distances. Cranes can often be very tall. Cranes are used to move large parts of a building as it is being constructed or perhaps as  it is being torn down, as it is being taken apart.

Bill says, “You can see [the bulldozer and the cran e] just fine from the street. And from the street, you won't be my responsibility!” B ill means that if Estelle leaves the construction site, then he doesn't have to worr y about her.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

You don't need a hard hat to be a scriptwriter. You  do need creativity, and that's something that our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse, has a great deal of. Thank you, Lucy.
