"Well," she answered, "I don't remeber, docotr, but I will try to think." She thought for a minute and then said, "Yes, I remember now, docotr! When I married, I was eighteen years old, and my husband was thirty. Now my husband is sixty, I know. And that is twice thirty, So I am twice eighteen. That is thirty-six, isn't it?"
