This episode is about writing a letter of inquiry.  That is, you’re asking a question; you’re trying to get information.  That’s normally what an “inquiry” is.  In this case, really, it is a letter asking for a job.  Let’s get  started. > I was laid off from my job three months ago.  Since  then, I’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.  So far, nothing has turned up, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry lett ers to every company that might have a job opening. …

> Our story begins when I say, “I was laid off from m y job three months ago.”  “To be laid (laid) off” means to lose your job, to be f ired, to say I’m sorry, you no longer work here.  “Since then (since that time), I ’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.”  “To pound (poun d) the pavement (pavement)” is an expression that means to spend a lot of time walking along the streets, especially going to different businesses o r different houses.  “Pavement” is another word for street, and “to pound” usually means to hit something hard, like with a tool called a “hammer.”  But here, you are hitting the ground with your feet; you’re pounding the pavement.  It’s a general  expression meaning to work very hard, to be looking in many different places e ither because you’re trying to sell something or because, in this case, you need a  job. 

I say that so far, nothing has turned up.  “To turn  up” is a two-word – say it with me – phrasal verb meaning to appear suddenly, to su ddenly be present.  But, I’m saying that nothing has turned up, meaning I still don’t have a job, “so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry l etters to every company that might have a job opening.”  The expression “to take  the bull (bull) by the horns (horns)” means to do something without hesitation, even when it looks difficult or challenging, to try to take direct to control over something.  You feel your life is out of control; you need to make a strong, bold dec ision.  You’re going to take the bull by the horns; you’re going to actually do it, whatever that is, even when it seems difficult.  “Inquiry letters” are letters tha t you send to a company, asking them something; often, it’s asking for a job.  An “ inquiry” is another word for a question.  A “job opening” is when a company is try ing to find someone to work for them.  We might also call it a “vacant position ,” but “job opening” is more common.  You might ask someone, “Does your company have any openings?” That is, are they looking for people to hire – to w ork there. 

Then we get to the actual letter that I write.  I b egin by saying, “Dear Ms. Smith,” or whatever the name of the personnel officer is.  “Personnel” is a word related to the employees of a company.  An “officer” would be someone who’s a boss, someone who’s in charge.  So, a “personnel officer”  is the person who is the boss of the department that hires people, that goes  out and finds people for the company and gets them to work there.  Sometimes we call it the “personnel office,” sometimes it’s called the “human resources  office.”  

 My letter begins by saying, “I am writing to inquir e (to ask) about any job openings you may have for someone with my experienc e and qualifications.” Your “qualifications” are the things you know, your  education, your experience, perhaps something about you as a worker that make y ou qualified or fit for a job. You are able to do it.  So, you talk about your qua lifications, the things that show or demonstrate that you will be able to do this job .  I say that I worked for six years as a “software engineer,” someone who makes s oftware programs, for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and experie nce related to software development.  When you have “extensive” training, y ou have a lot of it, something that would cover a long period of time an d perhaps a lot of knowledge about that area.  I don’t have a little bit of trai ning; I have extensive training. 

I say then, “I have enclosed a copy of my résumé.”  “To enclose” (enclose) means to put one thing inside of something else.  I n this case, it’s a piece of paper inside an envelope.  Usually this word is use d in a written letter to indicate that there is something else in the envelope beside s the letter that you are reading; in this case, it’s a copy of my résumé (ré sumé).  A “résumé” gives a brief description of your experiences and qualifications:  where you went to school, what kind of skills, what kind of knowledge you hav e, where you worked before you applied for this job.  I then say, “I would app reciate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any  consulting work your company requires.”  So, he’s saying do you have any thing that is close to my qualifications or do you have any consulting work.  “To consult” usually means to ask someone else their advice or opinion; “consulti ng” is working for companies, but just doing specific projects.  You’re there for  maybe a month, two months, six months; you’re not a permanent employee of the comp any. 

I then say, “Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.”  “Considerat ion” means the time that you spent thinking about something, especially making y our decision about someone’s proposal or request to do something.  So,  I’m thanking the person, we might say “in advance,” for taking the time to read  my letter and perhaps to call me about any job openings.  I say, “please don’t he sitate to contact me.”  “To hesitate” means to delay or wait to do something, u sually because you’re not sure if it’s a good idea that you do it.  I say, “d on’t hesitate to contact me.”  It’s not a problem; you can call me, you can email me, and s o forth.  Then I sign the letter, “Sincerely, Steve Woz.” 

At the end I say, “I’m planning to personally deliv er each letter.”  Normally, letters are delivered by the Post Office; but here I say I’ m going to deliver the letter, I’m going to actually go to each of these companies, “w ith the hope of talking with  

someone in the company.”  So he’s going to take the  letter to the personnel officer, but he’s going to try also to talk to othe r people in the company to see if he can find out any more information about whether they have any job openings. He says, “It is going take a lot of time and legwor k.”  “Legwork” (one word) is another word for a lot of traveling, doing a lot of  work that is difficult or boring. Sometimes we use this word even if we aren’t talkin g about walking or traveling or running – moving ourselves personally.  Sometime s we use the word to talk about the hard, somewhat difficult research or inve stigation that you have to do in order to complete a project.  I then say, “I have n o intention of sitting home and twiddling my thumbs while I wait for my next job!”  To say “you have no intention of (doing something)” means you have no plans to do  that; you’re not going to do it.  I say that I don’t want to be twiddling my thu mbs.  Your “thumbs” are the short, you can think of it, finger that you have; you have  five fingers, the shortest one is the thumb.  “To twiddle” (twiddle) means to hold yo ur hands together, and “to twiddle your thumbs” means to take your thumbs and move them in small circles, one around the other.  It’s an expression, however,  that means to waste your time, not to do anything, instead just sit back, wa it, don’t worry about it.  That would be twiddling your thumbs.  I say I do not wan t to sit around and twiddle my thumbs; I want to go out and do something, and that ’s what I’m doing, trying to go to each company and deliver this letter of inqui ry. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of story] 

I was laid off from my job three months ago.  Since  then, I’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.  So far, nothing has turned up, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry lett ers to every company that might have a job opening. … 

Dear Ms. Smith (or the name of their personnel offi cer): 

I am writing to inquire about any job openings you may have for someone with my experience and qualifications.  I worked for six  years as a software engineer for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and exp erience related to software development. 

I’ve enclosed a copy of my résumé.  I would appreci ate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any  consulting work your company requires. 

Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely, Steve Woz … 

I’m planning to personally deliver each letter, wit h the hope of talking with someone in the company.  It is going take a lot of time and legwork, but I have no intention of sitting home and twiddling my thumbs w hile I wait for my next job!
