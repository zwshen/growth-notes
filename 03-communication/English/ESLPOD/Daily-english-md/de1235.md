[start of dialogue]

Nathan: Can you keep a secret?

Mia: Sure.

Nathan: I’ve been initiated into a secret society a t school. I’m one of the chosen few.

Mia: Is it supposed to be a big deal?

Nathan: Of course it is. It’s very exclusive. Not m any people are invited to join.

Mia: But what’s the purpose of this secret society?

Nathan: Well, we have a secret handshake and we hav e some really mysterious rites and rituals.

Mia: What kinds of rites and rituals?

Nathan: I can’t tell you. I’ve been sworn to secrec y.

Mia: But what is the purpose of the society? Do you  have some goal to accomplish, some reason for existence?

Nathan: The point is that the members are bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.

Mia: You mean like you’d take a bullet for each oth er?

Nathan: Well, no.

Mia: Or protect each other at all costs, even by ly ing and cheating?

Nathan: No, at least I wouldn’t.

Mia: Then what does it all amount to?

Nathan: If anyone asks us about it, we deny its exi stence. We have a secret that no one else knows.

Mia: Not anymore.

Nathan begins our dialogue by asking Mia a question : “Can you keep a secret (secret)?” “Secret” is information that you don’t t ell anyone else, that you keep private. Mia says, “Sure. I can keep a secret,” mea ning “I can get information and then not tell anyone else about it.” Nathan says, “ I’ve been initiated into a secret society at school.” “To initiate” (initiate) means to formally or officially allow someone into an organization, usually with some sor t of special ceremony, some sort of special set of actions.

Nathan says that he has been “initiated into,” or m ade a member of, “a secret society.” A “secret society” is an organization who se members don’t talk about what goes on inside of the organization. Sometimes a secret society isn’t known to very many people – that is, not very many people  know about it – but in some cases a secret society can be well-known – that is,  lots of people know that it exists, but only the people inside of this group or  society know what happens in the group.

There are some universities that have secret societ ies. Most famously, Yale University has some secret societies. Nathan has be en made a member of a secret society at his school. He says, “I’m one of the chosen few.” That expression “the chosen (chosen) few” refers to a sm all group of people who are better than others – who are chosen, who are select ed, because they meet certain qualifications. We might also use the word “elite” (elite) to describe this concept.

Mia says, “Is it supposed to be a big deal?” meanin g “Is this something important?” Nathan says, “Of course it is. It’s ver y exclusive.” Something that is “exclusive” (exclusive) is limited to a small numbe r of people. There are only very few people who are allowed into this group. “Not ma ny people are invited to join,” Nathan adds. Mia says, “But what’s the purpose of t his secret society?” Nathan says, “Well, we have a secret handshake and we have  some really mysterious rites and rituals.”

A “handshake” (handshake) is what happens when you put your hand in someone else’s hand. A “secret handshake” is a spec ial way of holding or touching someone else’s hand when you meet them tha t only people in a secret society know. Nathan says his secret society has a secret handshake. So, when two members of this group meet each other, instead of just shaking hands as two people would normally, they do something special wi th their hands. I don’t know what, of course, because it’s secret.

Nathan says his group also has some “mysterious rit es and rituals.” Something that is “mysterious” (mysterious) is something that  many people wonder about or are interested in but don’t understand. A “rite” (r ite) – notice the different spelling, not (right) – is one part of a larger ceremony, som ething that people do together as a group. The word “rite” is normally associated with a religious ceremony, a religious event, but here it’s associated with what  happens in this secret society.

A “ritual” (ritual) is something that is done in a ceremony or celebration repeatedly, every time the ceremony takes place. A “ritual,” however, could also describe anything that someone does repeatedly as p art of a larger event or process. The difference between “rite” and a “ritua l” is that a rite is usually something that involves several different rituals a nd words, or speeches, or other kinds of actions.

A ritual is part of a rite, or could be part of a r ite, but the word “rite” is usually used to describe a whole set of rituals or a group of rituals and texts that are part of some ceremony – often a religious ceremony, but not always religious as is seen in this example, because the secret society ha s rites as well. Mia is curious. She says, “What kinds of rites and rituals?” Nathan  says correctly, “I can’t tell you.” Of course, if it’s a secret society you can’t  tell anyone what goes on in the secret society.

Nathan says, “I’ve been sworn to secrecy.” “To be s worn (sworn) to secrecy” means to have made a promise to someone or some gro up of people not to talk about a certain topic, not to share secret informat ion. Mia says, “But what is the

purpose of the society? Do you have some goal to ac complish, some reason for existence?” That is, is there some reason why you h ave this group?

Nathan responds, “The point is that the members are  bound by an allegiance to each other and to the society.” Nathan says the rea son the society exists is that its members are “bound (bound) by an allegiance (al legiance).” An “allegiance” is loyalty or commitment to another person. If you are  bound by something, you are obligated. You have to do it. So, “to be bound by a n allegiance to each other” means you are committed to loyalty to helping other  people – in this case, other people in your society. Mia then asks, “You mean li ke you’d take a bullet for each other?”

The expression “to take a bullet” (bullet) means to  die in order to protect another person by getting in the way of a bullet from a gun  that might be aimed at that person or heading towards that person. The most fam ous example of this would be the people who protect the president of the Unit ed States. These group of people are called the “Secret Service,” and their j ob is, in fact, to take a bullet for the president – that is, to protect the president e ven if it means getting in front of the president if someone is trying to shoot the pre sident.

More generally, the expression means that you would  die for another person in order to protect that person. Mia is asking if this  secret society is about having each other protect each other even if it means deat h. Nathan says, “Well, no.” Mia says, “Or protect each other at all costs, even  by lying and cheating?” “At all costs” (costs) means no matter what, in all circums tances or all situations. Nathan says no, the secret society doesn’t mean tha t you would protect other members at all costs. Nathan says he wouldn’t do th at.

Mia then asks, “Then what does it all amount to?” S he’s asking what is the value or purpose of this society. That’s what the express ion “to amount to” means. What is its purpose? What is its importance? What i s its significance? Nathan responds, “If anyone asks us about it,” meaning ask s us about the secret society, “we deny its existence.”

“To deny” (deny) means to say that something does n ot exist – to reject or refuse something. Some people deny reality. They decide th at even though something is obviously true or something obviously exists, th ey say, “Oh no, it isn’t true. It doesn’t exist.” That’s what Nathan means when he sa ys that the members of his secret society deny the society’s existence. They s ay, “Oh no, there is no such thing as a secret society.”

He says, “We have a secret that no one else knows,”  but of course Nathan has just told Mia about his secret society, which is wh y Mia says at the end of our dialogue, “Not anymore,” meaning “Well, it used to be secret, but because you told me about your secret society, it is no longer a secret because I know about it.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

It’s no secret that the best scriptwriter in the wo rld, in my opinion, is Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
