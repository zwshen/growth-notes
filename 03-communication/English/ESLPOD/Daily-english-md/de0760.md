This episode is a dialogue between Bill and Carol a bout “paycheck deductions.” This is money that your company takes out of your “ paycheck,” what you get paid every week or every month, for a variety of purpose s.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bill:  It’s about time!  I’ve been waiting for my f irst paycheck and now it’s finally here.  I’m ready to party this weekend!  Whoa!

Carol:  What’s the matter?

Bill:  What happened to all my money?  The amount of this check is a lot less than I expected it to be.

Carol:  Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-opener f or me, too.  Look at the pay stub and you’ll see all of the deductions.  After f ederal income taxes, state income taxes, and FICA, you’re not left with a lot of money.

Bill:  You’re right, but what’s FICA?

Carol:  Those are taxes for Social Security and Med icare.  Did you sign up for a retirement plan?  If you did, those retirement cont ributions are deducted, too.

Bill:  Thank God, I didn’t.  But you know what?  Th at still doesn’t account for all of the deductions.

Carol:  Let me take a look.  Oh, it looks like your  wages are being garnished.

Bill:  They’re garnishing my wages?  What for?

Carol:  Uh, do you have to pay child support or som ething like that?

Bill:  Oh, yeah, I guess I do.  I’d forgotten about  that.  I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.

Carol:  I guess so.

Our dialogue begins with Bill.  He says, “It’s abou t time!”  “It’s about time” is an expression that usually means that you are happy th at something has finally happened; you’ve been waiting for it for a long tim e.  In fact, you’ve been waiting so long you’ve been a little upset, maybe even angr y that this thing hasn’t happened.  I called my sister the other day and she  didn’t call me back.  I waited a week, I called her again, she didn’t call me back .  Then suddenly, three weeks later, she called me.  I said to her, “Well, it’s a bout time,” meaning I’m happy you called but I’m not happy I had to wait so long.  We ll for Bill, it’s about time that he has finally got a job and is getting paid.  He says , “I’ve been waiting for my first paycheck and now it’s finally here.”  Your “paychec k” is the money that you get for working.  Some people get paid every week, most  people get paid every two weeks, some people only once a month.  Bill says, “ I’m ready to party this weekend,” that is, I’m ready to go out and celebrat e, to have a party.  Then suddenly he says, “Whoa!”  “Whoa” is what you might  say to a horse to stop it, that’s where you hear that expression, but it now m eans more generally that you are surprised by something, that you want to stop the conversation or to stop what you were talking about because something surpr ising, often negative, has happened.  Carol says, “What’s the matter?”  What’s  wrong?  Bill says, “What happened to all my money (or all of my money)?”  He ’s looking at his paycheck; he sees that the amount that he was paid is less th an he expected.  He says, “The amount of this check is a lot less than I expe cted it to be.”

Carol says, “Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-ope ner for me, too.”  To say something is an “eye (eye) -opener (opener)” means that it is a very surprising experience, but something that teaches you an impor tant lesson about something.  That’s an eye-opener; it opens your eye s; you suddenly see something you didn’t see before or know something y ou didn’t know before. Carol says, “Look at the pay stub and you’ll see al l of the deductions.”  A “pay stub” (stub) is the document that the company that you work for gives you, in addition to your check, that tells you all of the t hings that were taken out of your check.  It also tells you typically how many hours you worked, how much you got paid for working that number of hours, and so forth .  Nowadays most people don’t get paid with a physical check; many companie s simply send the money

directly to your bank, what we would call “direct d eposit.”  However, most companies still give you a pay stub, or make one av ailable electronically to you, that shows all of the deductions.  A “deduction” is  a noun, it comes from the verb “to deduct” (deduct), which is the same as subtract  or take out of.  “Deductions” are things that the company takes out of your total  pay.

Carol mentions a couple of these deductions.  She s ays, “After federal income taxes, state income taxes, and (FICA)” or “FICA, yo u’re not left with a lot of money.”  “Income taxes” are money that you pay to the government.  Almost everyone pays some percentage of their money to the  national or federal government.  If you don’t make a lot of money, the government will give you that money back at the end of the year; technically the following year after you file your income tax returns.  That is, you tell the gov ernment how much you made last year, how much you paid in taxes.  Some people  get their money back; many people don’t.  The more money you make the less lik ely you are to get any money back from the government.  In addition to nat ional or federal income taxes, Americans also pay, in most states, a state income tax.  Here in California that can be as high as I think close to 10 percent of the money you make.  The federal income taxes can be as much as 35 percent, depending on how much money you make.  You have to be making a lot of money to be paying the top or maximum amount of 35 percent, however.  Everyone pa ys (FICA) or FICA taxes, (FICA) stands for Federal Insurance Contributions A ct.  Basically, that was a law that required employers to hold part of the money that you earn every week or every two weeks, to take some of that and give it to the government, who uses it for retirement and healthcare purposes.

Bill says, “You’re right, but what’s (FICA)?”  Caro l then explains; she says, “Those are taxes for Social Security and Medicare.”   Those are the two things I just mentioned.  “Social Security” relates to retir ement, for the most part.  That is, when you stop working when you are, say, 65 or 68 y ears old you get some money back from the government.  It’s money, in par t, related to the amount of money you paid in Social Security taxes.  “Medicare ” is money the government gives people who need help paying their medical or hospital and doctor bills. Medicare, like Social Security, was mainly designed  to help people who are old, people who’ve stopped working.  It can also be used , however, to help people who are disabled in some way, who can’t walk for ex ample.  It will also help people who cannot work for some other reason, as we ll.  That’s Social Security and Medicare.  But your pay stub usually doesn’t say Social Security and Medicare, it says (FICA).  Carol says, “Did you sig n up for a retirement plan?”  In addition to Social Security, many people also have their own “retirement plan,” money that they save each paycheck for their retire ment, when they are no

longer working.  So, “retirement contributions” wou ld be money that you are saving yourself for your retirement.

Bill says, “Thank God, I didn’t.”  “Thank God” mean s he’s happy that he didn’t, although someday he may not be happy that he didn’t .  Bill says, “But you know what?  That still doesn’t account for all of the de ductions.”  “To account for” means to explain.  So Bill is saying that he unders tands the income taxes and the (FICA) taxes, but that still doesn’t explain where some of the money has gone, why his paycheck is not as big as he thinks it shou ld be.

Carol says, “Let me take a look.  Oh, it looks like  your wages are being garnished.”  “Wages” (wages) is another word for mo ney that you get every hour for working.  Usually “wages” is a term we use for people who get paid by the hour: they get 12 dollars an hour, 20 dollars an ho ur, 25 dollars an hour.  That’s wages; the more hours you work the more money you m ake.  Another term related to that is “salary” (salary).  A “salary” is when you get paid one amount, and it doesn’t matter how many hours you work.  The  better the job, the higher the income from the job, typically the more likely you will have a salary and not a wage.  Wages are for when you get paid by the hour,  and the more hours you work the more money you make.  Salary is when you h ave one amount of money, regardless of how many hours you actually wo rk.  Carol says that Bill’s wages have been garnished.  By the way, “wage” is a  word with a couple of different meanings in English.  Go back to the Learning Guide that you downloaded from our website and you can see some ad ditional definitions.

So, Bill’s wages are being garnished.  “To garnish”  (garnish) means the company doesn’t give you all of your money.  It holds some of the money usually because you owe someone else money, and legally they have to take some of that money and give it to someone else.  Now why would they do  that, you may be asking. Bill asks that as well; he says, “They’re garnishin g my wages?  What for?” meaning why, for what reason.

Carol says, “Uh, do you have to pay child support o r something like that?”  “Child support” is money that you have to pay the typicall y mother of the child, if you’re a man.  It could be that the mother has to pay the father, it depends one who when a couple gets divorced or when they are no lon ger with each other, supporting each other economically, the person who isn’t raising the child primarily has to pay the other person money to pay for the expenses of the child. It could be a baby; it could be anyone up to the ag e of 18.  That’s what child support is.  If you don’t pay child support the oth er person, typically the wife, will go to the court – to the legal system – and they wi ll demand that you pay that money, and they will tell the person you’re working  for they have to take some of

that money and give it to the person who is raising  your child.  That’s what child support is.

Bill says, “Oh, I guess I do,” meaning yes, I do ha ve child support that I have to pay.  He said, “I’d forgotten about that.”  A stran ge thing to forget about!  Bill says, “I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.”   He was going to go out and spend money on drinking or having a party, but now he realizes he doesn’t have very much money so he has to change his plans.  Car ol agrees; she says, “I guess so.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
