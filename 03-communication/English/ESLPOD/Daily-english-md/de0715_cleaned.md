This episode is called “Outsiders (people who live in other places) Moving In (to a new place; a new neighborhood).”  Let’s get started . 

[start of dialogue] 

Leti:  I am sick and tired of people coming from th e big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like the y own the place. 

George:  This is a dying town and it needs fresh bl ood.  I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town. 

Leti:  Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their  spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for families who have lived here f or generations.   

George:  The times are changing and we need to adap t.   

Leti:  I say that the newcomers are the ones who ne ed to adapt.  After all, they’re moving to our town. 

George:  With that kind of us against them mentalit y, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers. 

Leti:  I look forward to that day. 

George:  All I have to say is beware what you wish for! 

[end of dialogue] 

Leti begins by saying to George, “I am sick and tir ed of people coming from the big cities into our small town.”  The expression “t o be sick and tired” doesn’t  

mean you’re actually ill; you’re not really sick an d you may not even be tired.  It’s an expression we use to show that you are angry, th at you are frustrated, especially about something that continues to happen  over a long period of time. “I’m sick and tired of hearing you talk about your dog and how wonderful it is.” I’m tired of it; I don’t want to hear it anymore, y ou’ve been talking about it for many days now.  Leti is sick and tired of people mo ving from big cities into her little, small town.  She says they are “buying up a ll of the houses and acting like they own the place.”  “To buy up” means the same as  “to buy.”  The “up” has a certain sense of emphasis, that it’s happening quic kly perhaps, or that you are buying all that remains of something, not leaving a nything for anyone else.  The “outsiders,” people from outside of the little town , “are buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.”  “To act like you own a place” means to feel too comfortable, or perhaps too confident in a plac e where you don’t really belong.  If you visit someone else’s house that you  don’t know very well, and you come into the house and say, “Hey, where’s the refr igerator?  I’m hungry,” well, that’s acting like you own the place.  It’s also co nsidered rather rude to do such a thing.  So, “to act like you own the place” would b e to do things that you don’t really have a right to do.   

Leti is angry at these outsiders, but George has a different opinion.  George says, “This is a dying town.”  “To die,” of course,  means to end one’s life; a “dying town” would be a town that is no longer doing very well economically; people are leaving, there aren’t enough jobs, things like that .  George says the town “needs fresh blood.”  “Fresh blood,” here, means new peopl e, people who have not been present before.  He says, “I don’t hear the busines s owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.”  The busi ness owners, the people who own the stores and other businesses, are happy.  Th ey’re not complaining about the new infusion of money.  An “infusion” (infusion ) really in this case just means addition, something that is added to it larger or b igger.  In this case, the town is getting richer because new people are coming in and  bringing their money and spending their money in the town. 

Leti says, “Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their spending is jacking up prices.”  The “flip (flip) side” of something is th e opposite side of a certain argument or issue.  I could say, “Well, it’s a beau tiful, sunny day,” and you could say, “Well, the flip side is it’s going to be very hot.”  So it’s the aspect or the thing that you’re not thinking about, usually opposite of  what the other person is talking about.  It could be positive; it could be negative.   Back in the old days, when I was a child, they would sell records, and the recor ds would have a song on each side, especially the small what were called “45s.”  So you may have a very popular song on one side, and on the flip side anot her song by the same singer, perhaps a little less popular; we also called it th e “B-side.”  In any case, “flip side”  

here is used generally to mean the other aspect of something that you haven’t considered.  Leti says the flip side of these new p eople moving in – these outsiders – is that their spending is jacking up pr ices.  “To jack up” is a phrasal verb meaning to increase.  It’s normally used with the word “prices.”  We talk about “jacking up prices,” we’re talking about incr easing prices, things are getting more expensive.  When you have more people wanting to buy the same amount of things or the same things as other people the pr ice will usually go up, because there are people who are willing to pay more money now.  This makes it harder, Leti thinks, for the families who have lived here f or generations.  A “generation” is usually people who are born around the same time; s ome people consider 20 years a generation.  But in any case, the term here  means people who have lived here a long time.  My family has lived in the Unite d States for eight generations, which is about right, a little more than that maybe .  In any case, a long time is what is meant by this expression.  Within a family,  a generation are the people who are all born as brothers and sisters or cousins .  So my parents is one generation, and my brothers and sisters were the ne xt generation, and my nieces and nephews – the sons and daughters of my brothers  and sisters – are a separate generation.  So when I say that we’ve live d here for eight generations, I mean my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g randfather – actually grandmother came to the United States; that was the  first McQuillan that arrived here, at least from my family.  So that’s what a ge neration is.  Anyway, enough about my family; let’s get back to the story.  Wher e were we?  Oh, yeah. 

George says, “The times are changing and we need to  adapt.”  “The times are changing” means the world is changing, things are n ot the same as they were before.  He says we need to accept that, “we need t o adapt.”  “To adapt” (adapt) means to change in response to the changes in your situation or in your environment.  “Adapt” has a couple of different mea nings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.   

Leti says, “I say (meaning my opinion) is that the newcomers are the ones who need to adapt.”  The “newcomers” (newcomers – one w ord) are the people who have just moved into an area; they are new to the a rea.  She says that they are the ones who need to change, to adapt themselves to  the small-town life rather than changing it and making those who have lived th ere for generations adapt. She says, “After all, they’re moving to our town.” 

George says, “With that kind of us against them men tality, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.”  Let’s start with “us against them mentality.”  “Us against them” is the idea tha t you and your group are opposed to another group, that you have opposite in terests or perhaps competing interests; what’s good for them is not go od for you, and what’s good  

for you is not good for them.  That’s “us against t hem” or “us versus them.” “Mentality” is the way of thinking about something;  we might call it your “perspective.”  George says that with kind of think ing – that kind of perspective, “there may be a day when you succeed in driving out  those newcomers,” meaning in the future – some day – you may be succe ssful, you may actually drive out the newcomers.  “To drive out” is a two-w ord phrasal verb that means to do something to make other people leave, especially  a neighborhood or a town, to do things that will make them want to leave.  Th ere are other meanings of the verb “to drive,” and “to drive out,” as well as the  verb “to adapt” that we talked about earlier.  All of that information can be foun d in the Learning Guide for this episode. 

George says that Leti and her attitude may drive ou t these newcomers.  Leti says, “I look forward to that day.”  “To look forwa rd to (something)” is to be excited about it, to be waiting for it to happen, t o want it to happen now.  George says, “All I have to say is beware what you wish fo r!”  George is telling Leti that she should “beware” or be careful of what she wishe s for, or wants to happen. It’s a phrase we use to warn someone that if he or she gets what he or she wants there may be some bad things that they haven’t thou ght of, things that you may not expect, so that sometimes we need to be careful  about wanting to change things. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Leti:  I am sick and tired of people coming from th e big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like the y own the place. 

George:  This is a dying town and it needs fresh bl ood.  I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town. 

Leti:  Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their  spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for the families who have lived he re for generations.   

George:  The times are changing and we need to adap t.   

Leti:  I say that the newcomers are the ones who ne ed to adapt.  After all, they’re moving to our town. 

George:  With that kind of us against them mentalit y, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.  

 Leti:  I look forward to that day. 

George:  All I have to say is beware what you wish for!
