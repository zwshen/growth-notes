This episode is called “Not the Marrying Kind.” It’ s a dialogue about a man who doesn’t seem to want to get married. Let’s get star ted! 

[start of dialogue] 

Stacey:  I have a date with George this Saturday. I  can’t wait! 

Brad:  Have a good time, but you know what the word  on the street is about George, don’t you? 

Stacey:  What?   

Brad:  He’s not the marrying kind.   

Stacey:  Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl yet.  When he does, he’ll be ready to settle down. 

Brad:  I don’t think so. Women who have gone out wi th him have told me that he’s up front with them:  he has no intention of ty ing the knot – ever. 

Stacey:  Do you think he’s a commitment phobe?   

Brad:  I have no idea. I just know that he likes to  play the field and anyone who dates him should not try to reform him. 

Stacey:  I wouldn’t try to reform him. I think he’l l just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him. 

Brad:  Don’t count on it. 

Stacey:  I’m convinced of it. 

Brad:  I’m always surprised by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love!

Stacey is talking with Brad and she says, “I have a  date with George this Saturday.” A “date” (date) is when you have a roman tic evening or afternoon with someone – you go somewhere with someone – usually i t’s romantic. Sometimes “date” can just mean an appointment. But here it me ans a romantic time together. Stacey says, “I can’t wait.” I’m really l ooking forward to this date. Brad says, “Have a good time. But you know what the word  on the street is about George don’t you?” The expression “the word on the street” means what people are saying about something even though they don’t h ave proof that it’s true – here’s what people are talking about, here’s what p eople are saying about this thing or this person. Often it just means a rumor ( rumor). Stacey says, “What?” Brad says, “Well, the word on the street about Geor ge is that he’s not the marrying kind.” The expression “not the marrying (m arrying) kind” means he’s a person who’s not interested in getting married. He wants to remain single. Usually, this is said about a man. Sometimes it cou ld be said about a woman as well. “He’s not the marrying kind.” We might also s ay, “He’s not the marrying type (type).” It means the same thing. He’s not a person  that will want to get married. 

Stacey says, “Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl  yet.” He hasn’t met the right person for him. That’s what all women believe that even men who are not the marrying kind will marry them because they are the perfect woman for them. Stacey says, “When he does” – when he does meet the  right girl or the right woman – “he’ll be ready to settle down.” The phrasa l verb “to settle (settle) down” means to begin to live a quiet, calm life. Usually,  it’s an expression we use when we are talking about someone in their, say, 20’s or  perhaps 30’s who’s now ready to get married. They were single for a long t ime. They like to go out and party and enjoy themselves. But now the fun must en d and they get married. No, I’m just kidding. Getting married is fun, too, kids !  

Brad disagrees with Stacey. He doesn’t think that G eorge is ready to settle down and get married. Brad says, “Women who have gone ou t with him – meaning who have gone on dates with him – have told me that  he’s upfront with them.” To be “upfront” means to be direct, to be honest, to b e straightforward – you’re not hiding anything, you’re not trying to be secret. We  use this term, usually, when we are trying to tell someone something that perhap s is difficult for them to hear or that they don’t want to hear and we want to be h onest with them – we want to  

tell them right away. Brad says that George has bee n upfront with women. “He has no intention of tying the knot – ever.” “Intent ion” (intention) is what you plan to do. It’s what your plan is, what your goal or yo ur aim (aim) is. Brad says, “George has no intention – he has no plans to tie ( tie) the knot (knot).” The expression “to tie the knot” means to get married. It’s very common in American English. A “knot” is normally something, for exampl e, when you have shoes that have shoelaces, you tie a knot so that your shoes d on’t fall off. Well, here it means to tie a knot – I guess to your husband or yo ur wife, so that you won’t be separated. It’s kind of like going to jail – kind o f like prison – where I suppose in the old days, they would tie a knot around someone’ s hands so they couldn’t move – that’s marriage, basically.  

Stacey asks, “Do you think he’s a commitment phobe? ” “Commitment” is when you agree to do something with someone or you simpl y agree to do something – it’s like a promise. “Phobe” (phobe) refers to some one who’s afraid of something. So, a commitment phobe would be someone who’s afrai d of commitment – who doesn’t want to promise to do something like get ma rried. Brad says, “I have no idea” – I don’t know. “I just know – I only know – that he likes to play the field.” The expression “to play the field” describes, usual ly, a man who likes to date many different people – a person who doesn’t want t o just have one long-term relationship – romantic relationship. Sometimes we describe informally someone as being a “player” (player). The idea is similar –  someone who likes to have usually different girlfriends – he plays the field.  “Anyone who dates George,” Brad continues, “should not try to reform him.” “To refo rm (reform) someone” – or something – means to fix it, to change it, to make it better. Women often think they can change a man. They can reform him, they ca n make him different for what he really is. This is a common belief among ma ny women who get married. Is it true? Well, sometimes.  

Stacey says, “I won’t try to reform him. I think he ’ll just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him.” The expression “to fall head over heels (heels) in love with someone” means  to have a sudden strong romantic interest in someone. It’s – I suppose – re lated a little bit to “love at first sight (sight),” where you see someone – you see a b eautiful woman across the room or a beautiful man – a handsome man – and you fall in love with them. You fall “head over heels in love.”  

To fall head over heels doesn’t mean it happens the  first time you see them. That would be the expression “love at first sight.” But it could happen. You fall head over heels with someone the first time you see them . Stacey says that she thinks after George falls in love with her that he’ll put his “philandering ways behind him.” “Philander” (philander) means that a man goes  out and has romantic  

relationships with different women – typically sexu al relationships with different women. He’s not interested in having a relationship  with only one woman. Often, the man will be lying about his relationships to th e women that he is with. That’s the way men are sometimes, unfortunately. Stacey sa ys that she thinks George will put his “philandering ways” – ways (ways) here  means habits – “he will put his philandering ways behind him.” To put something  “behind you” or “behind him” means to forget about it, to no longer do that  thing. Brad says, “Don’t count on it.” “To count on something” means to depend on to rely on something, to believe something is true. Brad says, “Do not count  on it” – don’t expect that to happen. Stacey says, “I’m convinced of it” – I’m pe rsuaded, I believe it is true.  

Brad says, “I’m always surprised by the degree to w hich women can delude themselves when it comes to love.” “I’m always surp rised” –It always surprises me – this is an expression we use when we are talki ng about something perhaps that we don’t understand, but also as a way of emph asizing to the other person how we have a very different opinion than they do a bout something or how unusual we think their opinion or their action is. Brad says, “I’m always surprised the degree – the extent, the amount – to which wome n can delude themselves.” “To delude” (delude) means to lie and cause others to believe those lies. In this case, the women are deluding themselves – they’re l ying to themselves. They are trying to persuade themselves of something that  they know isn’t really true. So when you delude yourself, you are lying to yours elf because you don’t want to accept the reality – the truth. Brad says, “I’m alw ays surprised by the degree – by how much – by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love.” The expression “when it comes to” –  means concerning, regarding, in relation to, or about. Of course, thi s woman – Stacey – thinks she can reform George and Brad is saying, “No, that’s n ot going to be possible. You’re deluding yourself.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
