This episode is a dialogue between Dan and Marcia.  It’s called “Asking for More Time,” more time to do something.  Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Dan:  Hello.

Marcia:  Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project ?  We’re still on schedule, right?

Dan:  Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about  that.  We’ve had a slight delay.

Marcia:  What do you mean by “slight”?  Are you say ing that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?

Dan:  Not exactly.  I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.

Marcia:  How short?

Dan:  A week or two, tops.  We hit a minor snag, bu t we should have everything up and running in no time.

Marcia:  If the project has come to a grinding halt , then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.  We’re running on a tight schedule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Dan:  I know that all too well.

Marcia:  Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.

 Dan:  No, you don’t.  My head is on the chopping bl ock and the clock is ticking.

[end of dialogue]

Dan begins by saying “Hello” to Marcia.  Marcia say s, “Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project?”  The “status” (status) is t he current condition, the most up- to-date, the newest information we have about this project, this thing that you are working on.  Marcia says, “We’re still on schedule,  right?”  “To be on schedule” means be on time, that you are progressing – you ar e moving forward just as you had planned.  If you’re late in completing the diff erent parts of the project, we would say you were “behind schedule,” and if you ar e making better progress than you anticipated – than you planned, then we wo uld say you are “ahead of schedule.”  So there’s “ahead of schedule,” “behind  schedule,” and “on schedule.”

Dan says, “Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about that.”  “I’ve been meaning to” means I was planning on, I was thinking  about it, I should have called you.  He says, “We’ve had a slight delay.”  “Slight” (slight) here means very small; “minor,” we might say.  “Minor” (minor)  is something that is not very important; the opposite would be “major,” something  very important.  But “slight” means minor, unimportant.  There are other meanings  for the word “slight,” and those can be found in our Learning Guide.

So Dan says there has been a slight delay.  A “dela y” is something that causes you to be behind schedule – to be late.  Marcia say s, “What do you mean by ‘slight’?”  She’s asking Dan to say how unimportant  or how minor this delay is. “Are you saying that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?”  The “deadline” (one word) is the date and sometimes the time that something is supposed to be done, that something needs to be completed by.  “Th e deadline is 5:30 p.m. on Friday.”  That means whatever you’re doing has to b e done by 5:30 in the afternoon on Friday.

So Marcia is asking not too bright, not too smart, we get the impression, Dan – we’ll call him dumb Dan – Marcia’s asking dumb Dan if he is going to be able to meet the deadline.  “To meet the deadline” means to  be completed before or by the deadline.  Actually, I guess, Marcia says, “Are  you saying that you won’t (that you will not) be able to meet the deadline?”  Dan s ays, “Not exactly.”  “Not exactly” means “no,” but it implies – it gives you the idea that there is something wrong.  Now we find out what is wrong, what Dan is really saying.  He says, “I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.”  “To grant (something to someone)” as a verb means to give someone something , usually officially, like a

government giving something to one of its citizens or an organization giving something to an individual person.  Here, it means really to give permission, to say “yes, okay.”  Dan is asking for a short extensi on.  An “extension” here means when you are given more time to do something.  If t he deadline was Friday at five p.m., and you’re not going to be finished by then, you might ask for an extension until Monday at five p.m.

Marcia says, “How short?” meaning how short of an e xtension.  How much more time do you want dumb Dan?  Well, she doesn’t say “ dumb Dan,” but that’s what she means – right?  So Dan says, “A week or two, to ps.”  “Tops” is an informal way of saying maximum, at most.  In other words, it  won’t be more than that.  So, Dan says, “A week or two weeks, tops.  We hit a min or snag, but we should have everything up and running in no time.”  A “snag (or  snag)” (snag) is a problem; a small problem, but still a problem that prevents yo u from completing something, that causes a delay.  “Snag” has a few other meanin gs, and those can be found in the Learning Guide – of course!  Where else woul d you find them?

Dumb Dan says, “we should have everything up and ru nning in no time.”  The expression “to have (something) up and running” mea ns something will be working normally, functioning as it should function , doing what it’s supposed to be doing.  Marcia says, “If the project has come to  a grinding halt, then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.”  The expression “to come to a grinding halt” (halt) means to completely stop.  You could have a car tra veling down the street and suddenly you see a dog come out into the street and  you step on, or press on, your brakes to stop the car, but you stop it very q uickly.  We would say “it came to a grinding halt,” it stopped quickly.  Actually,  we don’t use this expression very often in talking about actual movement; usually we use it in talking about some sort of project or process that stops, that suddenl y stops, that completely stops. Marcia says if the project has stopped – if you’ve stopped making progress on it – then it’s not a minor snag, it would be a major s nag.  Marcia says, “We’re running on (meaning we’re operating on) a tight sch edule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.”  A “tight schedule” is a situati on where a lot of work needs to be done but in a very small amount of time.  If you on ly have two days to finish writing a book, that might be a very tight schedule  if you haven’t started writing already.  By the way, the opposite of a “tight sche dule” would not be a “loose schedule,” we wouldn’t say that.  You might say som ething like, “We have plenty of time,” or even, “We have all the time in the wor ld.”  There’s no rush; there’s no hurry.  With a tight schedule you have to hurry, yo u have to rush; you don’t have a lot of time.

Marcia says they don’t have a lot of time, they don ’t have a lot of time to spare (spare).  “To spare” is to have an extra amount of something.  It’s used as an

adjective when we are talking about something extra  that you have.  For example in your car, you should have a spare tire.  That’s an extra tire to put on your car in case you have problems with one of them.  In fac t, we typically call it just “a spare,” using “spare” there as a noun.  Here, it me ans they don’t have any extra time.

Dan says, “I know that all too well,” meaning I kno w it very well; I understand completely.  Marcia says, “Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.”  “To spell (something) out” can mean to give the letters  in the word, like I spell out words like “spare” (spare).  But the same expressio n also means to explain something in great detail, to talk about every litt le part of this thing you are trying to describe, to be very explicit.  Marcia is saying  that she does not need to spell it out for Dan – for dumb Dan; that’s another way of s aying “I don’t need to explain to you how serious the situation is.”  Sometimes, e specially when we’re giving someone bad news or telling them something they don ’t want to hear, we’ll use the opposite expression; we’ll say, “Let me spell i t out for you.  If you don’t give me my money I’m going to call the police!”

Dan says, “No, you don’t (you don’t need to spell i t out for me; you don’t need to explain what will happen to me if I don’t finish th is project on time – on schedule). My head is on the chopping block and the clock is t icking.”  The expression “to have your head on the chopping block” means for one  to be at risk of losing your job or otherwise having a very negative consequence  if they don’t do what they’re supposed to do.  It used to be, back in his tory and perhaps in some places still is, common to kill someone, especially  when the government was killing a criminal, to put their head on a piece of  wood and take a large “ax,” which is a sharp metal instrument used normally to cut trees, and chop or cut the head of the person off so that, of course, they wou ld die.  That’s the idea.  Well, we don’t do that anymore, at least not very often.  But the expression continues and it means now to be in trouble, to have some ser ious problems if you don’t finish or do what you’re supposed to do.  Dan says,  “the clock is ticking.”  This means simply that there is very little time left be fore something happens.  He has to hurry because there isn’t a lot of time left.  “ To tick” (tick) is the verb we use, or used to use clocks or watches because when the litt le wheel inside the clock moved around it made a little sound – “tick, tick, tick” – and that is why we talk about clocks ticking.  Clocks don’t tick anymore – most of them don’t because they’re electronic, but we still have the expressio n.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Dan:  Hello.

Marcia:  Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project ?  We’re still on schedule, right?

Dan:  Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about  that.  We’ve had a slight delay.

Marcia:  What do you mean by “slight”?  Are you say ing that we won’t be able to meet the deadline?

Dan:  Not exactly.  I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.

Dan:  I know that all too well.

Marcia:  Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.

Dan:  No, you don’t.  My head is on the chopping bl ock and the clock is ticking.
