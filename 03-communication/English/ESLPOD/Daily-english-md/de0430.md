This episode is called “Talking About Books.”  It’s a dialo gue between Maggie and Kurt using some common vocabulary we might use in talki ng about and recommending books.  Let’s get started.

Maggie:  What did you think of the book you started last  week?

Kurt:  Oh, I liked it well enough.

Maggie:  Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.

Kurt:  Well, it started off with a bang and the suspe nse in the first half was great. I couldn’t put it down.  Then, the pace changed in the  second half and it was an effort to finish it.

Maggie:  Really?  I read it a few months ago and I lo ved it.  I thought the characterization was really good.  I could really relate to the two main characters.

Kurt:  Yeah, that’s true enough, but the plot dragge d, don’t you think?  The author just couldn’t pull it off and the ending was laughabl e.

Maggie:  I really liked the ending!  I can’t wait for the sequel.

Kurt:  Well, that makes one  of us.

 Our dialogue begins with Maggie asking Kurt, “What did  you think of the book you started last week?” meaning the book you started to r ead last week.  Kurt said, “Oh, I liked it well enough.”  When someone says t hey like something “well enough,” it means they didn’t think it was great; it w as okay; it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either.  Maggie said, somewhat sarcasticall y, trying to be funny, “Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.”  A “glowing r ecommendation” is an enthusiastic statement that you should definitely do somet hing or see something or hear something.  A “recommendation” is a suggestion t o someone else; a “glowing recommendation” is a very positive, very enthusiast ic recommendation. Of course, Kurt is not giving a glowing recommendation;  Maggie’s just being funny.

Kurt says, “Well, (the book) started off with a bang.”  To “start off with a bang” (bang) means to begin in an exciting way, to begin well : “The meeting started off with a bang when the president said everyone would be g etting two weeks extra vacation this year.”  Kurt says the book “started off with a  bang (it was exciting at the beginning) and the suspense in the first half was g reat.”  The “suspense” is the feeling of being excited and wanting to know what is going to happen next, when you’re looking forward to something that will hap pen next.  There are lots of movies that that are suspenseful.  The movies of Alfred H itchcock, the great British director in the 1950s and 60s, those are suspense movies; you are waiting for something to happen.

Kurt says about the book, “I couldn’t put it down.”  To not be able to put a book (or something) down means you can’t stop reading it be cause it’s so exciting. When you’re reading a really good book, you really want  to continue reading it; you can’t put it down.  To “put (something) down” mean s literally to take it and put it on the table, or stop reading it in this case.  Kurt says, “Then, the pace changed in the second half (of the book) and it was an effort to finish it.”  The “pace,” here, just means the speed or rate of something.   This is a word we use about, for example, runners in a race: they are going a t a fast pace or a slow pace.  We can also use it to describe a book that you are reading.  “It’s going at a very fast pace” means it’s going very quickly, the story is changi ng and moving forward very quickly.  The word “pace” has a couple of di fferent meanings in English; look at the Learning Guide today for some addi tional explanations.

Kurt says that it was an effort to finish the book.  An “ effort,” here, means something that is difficult, something that requires ext ra work, extra concentration.  Maggie says, “Really?  I read it a few m onths ago and I loved it.” So, Maggie read the same book and she loved it.  “I tho ught the characterization was really good,” she says.  In a story – in a fictional or imaginary story,

 “characterization” is the way that people are made to se em real, usually in a book, story, or movie.  So someone may say, “Boy, this book has good characterization.”  That means that the people in the b ooks seemed real; they seemed interesting, perhaps, or complex.  Maggie says, “I co uld really relate to the two main characters.”  To “relate to someone,” or t o “relate to something,” means to understand someone, to be able to find someth ing similar in your own experiences.  Sometimes we simply say, “I can relate.”  F or example, you are in an airport and the person next to you is worried because  they are going to miss their flight (they will not leave at the correct time),  and you may say, “I can relate to that.  I missed my flight yesterday.”  Or, we may just  say informally, “I can relate,” meaning I understand.  So, Maggie can relat e to the characters (the people in the story), that means she can understand them ; she has some sort of common experience that they share.

Kurt says, “Yeah, that’s true enough (meaning that’s tru e), but the plot dragged, don’t you think?”  The “plot” is sometimes called the stor yline.  It’s the things that happen in a movie or a book or a story.  It’s the events t hat happen: the person goes to the party, he talks to a pretty girl, the girl i s not interested, so he talks to another pretty girl, and so on.  That would be a “plo t.”  That would also be the story of my life!  Now, when the “plot drags,” we mean it moves very slowly; it moves at a slow and boring pace; it doesn’t seem to move forward very quickly. “Drag” actually has a couple of meanings in English in a ddition to this one, so you know what to do: take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Kurt says, “The author just couldn’t pull it off.”  The “author” is the man or woman who writes the book or story; we may also call them the “w riter,” especially if we are talking about a movie.  The technical term for someo ne who writes a movie would be a “scriptwriter.”  Here on ESL Podcast our scrip twriter, the person who writes these stories that we talk about – these wonderfu l stories, is Dr. Lucy Tse. She’s the author of these dialogues.  “The author just couldn’t pull it off.”  This is an expression, a phrasal verb, “to pull (something) off”  or “to pull off (something)” means to be able to do something successfully; to be able to complete something that is difficult, especially when other peopl e don’t think you will be able to do it.  Kurt says the author could not pull it  off, “and the ending was laughable.”  The “ending” is, you may guess, the final p art of the story, the conclusion.  If you say something is “laughable, you mean it is so bad that it is funny because you can’t do anything other than laugh abo ut it.  You, in some ways, can’t believe how bad it is.  So, “laughable” mean s funny, but it means funny because it’s so bad.

 Maggie says, “I really liked the ending!  I can’t wait for the sequel.”  A “sequel” (sequel) is the second part or continuation of a book o r a movie.  So, it’s the second book.  I read a book a long time ago, a suspense s py book called Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy  by the British author John le Carré.  After he wrote that book it was very successful, so then he wrote another book – a sequ el.  There are a series of popular movies based on a book; the first one wa s called The Bourne Identity .  And then, that was successful so the author wrote anot her book, and they also made movies about these three books.  So, each on e is a sequel; the second and third books are sequels to the first.

Kurt doesn’t agree with Maggie, so he says, “Well, that makes one  of us.” Actually, Kurt is making a joke here: the normal expression  is “that makes two of us” when, for example, someone says something and you are  in the same situation.  Somebody says, “Oh, I missed my airplane (I misse d my flight at the airport),” you may say, “Well, that makes two of us.  I missed my flight, too.” Here, Kurt is making a joke, he says “that makes one  of us,” which is just a funny way to say you are the only person that thinks that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l pace.
