[start of dialogue]

Marianne:  I don’t understand it.  I got a notice f rom the bank that two of my checks bounced.  I’ve never had an overdraft in my life.

Jae:  That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re always s o careful with your money.

Marianne:  I am!  I don’t understand what happened.

Jae:  Let me take a look at your bank statement.  O kay, here are your deposits and withdrawals from last month.  Did you know that  your bank charges you a fee just to have a checking account?

Marianne:  It does?  I didn’t know that.

Jae:  It looks like you also have a minimum balance  requirement.  If you fall below that, you get charged a fee.

Marianne:  I do?

Jae:  If it’s like my checking account, you can avo id that by getting direct deposit for your paycheck.  Did you also know that you get charged every time you use your ATM card to make a purchase?

Marianne:  I didn’t know that!

Jae:  Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is cha rging you fees for all of those things and after those fees were deducted, you were  left with less money in your account than you thought.

Marianne:  That’s so sneaky!  How could they do tha t?

Jae:  They count on you not reading the terms and c onditions and not looking closely at your statements.

Marianne:  I’ve had it!  I’m moving banks.  I’m tak ing my business elsewhere.

Jae:  Oh, yeah?  I know of a good bank.

Marianne:  You do?

Jae:  Sure, it’s called the Bank of Jae.  No fees –  ever.

Marianne:  Yes, but would I ever see my money again ?

[end of dialogue]

Marianne begins by saying to Jae, “I don’t understa nd it.  I got a notice from the bank that two of my checks bounced.”  A “notice” (n otice) is a notification.  It’s basically an official letter or note telling you th at something is wrong or something about your official account.  You could get a notic e from the library telling you that you have to return your books.  The bank sent Marianne a notice that two of her checks bounced.  “To bounce (bounce) a check” m eans to write a check – that is, to write on a piece of paper saying that t his person can take that piece of paper to your bank and the bank will give him or he r the money – you write one of these checks but there isn’t money in your banki ng account to what we would say “cover the check,” in other words, to pay the c heck.  If you write a check for 3,000 dollars, and your checking account at the ban k has only 100 dollars your check will bounce; it will come back to the person and say sorry, this guy doesn’t have enough money.  Marianne says that she’s never had an overdraft in her life. An “overdraft” is when the bank says okay, we will pay this check even though you don’t have enough money, but now you have to pa y us back plus you have to pay some extra money.

Jae says, “That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re alw ays so careful with your money.”  Marianne says, “I am!  I don’t understand what happened.”  Jae says, “Let me take a look at your bank statement.”  Your “bank statement” is what they send you usually every month that shows all of the money that you have put in

your bank and all that you have taken out.  Jae say s, “Okay (looking at the bank statement now), here are your deposits (money that you put into your bank account) and withdrawals (money that you take out of your bank account).  Did you know that your bank charges you a fee just to h ave a checking account?” Jae is asking if Marianne realizes or knows that ev ery month the bank charges her a “fee,” in other words, an amount of money.  S o if you have a checking account, the bank will take 5 dollars or 10 dollars  out of your account each month to pay for your account.  Many banks have free chec king; they don’t charge you for a banking account, but some banks do, and when they do we call that a fee.

Marianne says, “It does?  I didn’t know that.”  Jae  says, “It looks like you also have a minimum balance requirement.”  Your “minimum  (meaning the least amount) balance (meaning the amount of money in you r bank account)” is what some banks set up or establish for certain accounts .  If you don’t keep enough money in your bank account, say 1,000 dollars or 50 0 dollars, then the bank will charge you a fee if you go below, or have less than  your minimum balance.  Jae says if you fall or go below that minimum, you get charged a fee.  Marianne says, “I do?”  Obviously, Marianne is not as careful as s he thinks she is.

Jae says, “If it’s like my checking account (if you r checking account is similar to my checking account), you can avoid that fee by get ting direct deposit for your paycheck.”  “Direct deposit” is when the company yo u work for doesn’t give you a check; it sends the money electronically directly t o your bank.  That’s called direct deposit.  If you have a checking account and  the company you work for has direct deposit, many times the bank will not ch arge you a fee.  Your “paycheck” is the money that you normally get for w orking.  In this case however, you don’t get a paycheck; the money goes right to y our bank.  Jae says, “Did you also know that you get charged every time you use y our ATM card to make a purchase?”  Jae is asking Marianne if she realizes that every time she uses her bank card – her plastic card that looks like a cred it card – to buy something she has to pay an extra fee to the bank.  “ATM” stands for automated teller machine. A “teller” is what we call the person who works at the bank who you go up and talk to to deposit or withdraw money.  An “automate d teller machine” is a machine that you put a card into, press some number s, and it either gives you money or allows you to deposit money.

Marianne says, “I didn’t know that!”  Once again, n ot too smart!  Jae says, “Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is charging you fe es for all of those things and after those fees were deducted (meaning after they took that money out of your account), you were left with less money in your acc ount than you thought.” Because Marianne did not know the bank was charging  her fees she had less money in her banking account than she thought she d id.  Marianne says, “That’s

so sneaky!”  Something that is “sneaky” (sneaky) is  something that is somewhat dishonest or deceptive; we might also say tricky.  They’re not clear about what they’re doing; they’re doing something without tell ing you, that’s the idea.

Marianne says, “How could they do that?”  Jae says,  “They (the bank) count on you not reading the terms and conditions and not lo oking closely at your statements.”  “To count on” means, as a two-word ph rasal verb, to rely on or to depend on, to assume and believe that something wil l happen.  The bank depends on the fact that you are not going to read the terms and conditions.  I should say that the word “count” has many different  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ones .  “Terms and conditions,” sometimes called in the business world “Ts and Cs,”  are the detailed part of an agreement or contract that specifies – that gives y ou all of the responsibilities, all of your rights, all of things that you have to do a nd that the bank will do.  Any contract has terms and conditions – most contracts,  that is.  The bank has terms and conditions, but most people when they open thei r account don’t read the terms and conditions, which are usually printed in a very small font – a very small size lettering.  Jae says they also count on you no t looking closely, or carefully, at your bank statements.

Marianne says, “I’ve had it!” meaning I am tired, I ’m frustrated, and I’m not going to continue to do this anymore.  “I’ve had it!  I’m  moving banks (I’m going to take my money and put it in a different bank).  I’m taki ng my business elsewhere.” “To take your business elsewhere” means to stop usi ng one company and start using a different company, usually because you are dissatisfied or unhappy with the first company.  Jae says, “Oh, yeah?  I know a good bank.”  Marianne says, “You do?”  Jae says, “Sure, it’s called the Bank of  Jae.”  He’s making a joke here; he’s saying that he can be her bank.  He says, “No fees – ever (you will never have to pay extra fees).”  Marianne says, “Yes, but  would I ever see my money again?”  Once again, following with the joke, she’s  saying that if she gave her money to Jae she would never see her money again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
