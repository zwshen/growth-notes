# Discovering a Minor Theft

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,284 – Discovering a Minor Theft. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,284. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

This episode is a dialogue between Maria and the ow ner of a store about stealing something from the store. Sounds dangerous. Let’s g et started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Maria: What’s going on here? I came as soon as I go t your phone call. Why are you holding onto my son like that? 

Store Owner: I am restraining your son because I ca ught him shoplifting. I thought you’d like to be here when I called the pol ice. 

Maria: There’s no need for that. He’s not a delinqu ent. 

Store Owner: He is from my standpoint. Theft is a s erious crime. 

Maria: I know it is and I’ll make restitution. Plea se give him a second chance. Please don’t call the police. 

Store Owner: Well, it’s not the value of what he’s stolen that’s important. It’s the fact that he committed an offense. 

Maria: Please let me pay for it and I’ll make sure he never enters your store again. What did he take and how much do I owe you? 

Store Owner: I told you that it’s not the cost of t he item. It’s the principle. 

Maria: What exactly did my son take? 

Store Owner: He ate a grape. 

Maria: One grape? 

Store Owner: Yes, before I stopped him. He could ha ve eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant. 

Maria: All this is over one grape. 

Store Owner: You should be thanking me for alerting  you to this behavior. As a parent, you know you need to nip these things in th e bud. Today it’s a grape; tomorrow it’s a car! 

Maria: [sigh] Okay, how much do I owe you for one g rape? 

[end of dialogue] 

Maria begins our dialogue by asking, “What’s going on here?” meaning “What is happening?” Maria continues, “I came as soon as I g ot your phone call.” So, someone has called Maria and Maria has traveled fro m her work or her home to this place. Well, it turns out we’re inside of a st ore in this dialogue. Maria then asks the person who owns the store, the person whos e store it is, “Why are you holding onto my son like that?” “To hold onto” some one means to put your arms or hands on someone so the person can’t leave, so h e doesn’t escape or go away from you.  

The store owner says, “I am restraining your son be cause I caught him shoplifting.” “To restrain” (restrain) someone mean s to make it difficult or impossible for a person to move. The store owner is  holding on to this, I assume, child because the young man was caught “shoplifting .” “Shoplifting” (shoplifting) comes from the verb “to shoplift,” which means to s teal something from a store – usually a small item, something that isn’t worth a lot of money.  

The store owner continues, “I thought you’d like to  be here when I called the police.” The shop owner is saying to the mother of this young man that he’s going to call the police and wanted the mother there when  he called. Maria says, “There’s no need for that,” meaning that isn’t nece ssary. “He’s not a delinquent.” A “delinquent” (delinquent) is a young person who c ommits a crime or who does things that are against the law. I was never a deli nquent, though I did know some people who were delinquents, who broke the law when  they were young.  

The store owner says, “He is from my standpoint.” T he store owner is saying, “Actually, yes. Your son, Maria, is a delinquent.” He’s a delinquent from the store owner’s “standpoint” (standpoint). “Standpoint” is another word for viewpoint, or perspective. It describes the way that you view or understand a situation. The  

store owner is saying, “Well, maybe you, Maria, don ’t think he’s a delinquent, but I think he’s a delinquent. Why? Well, because he st ole something.”  

“Theft,” he continues, “is a serious crime.” “Theft ” (theft) is a noun meaning the crime of stealing things, the illegal act of taking  things that don’t belong to you. Maria says, “I know it is,” meaning yes, theft is a  serious crime. I agree. She says, “I’ll make restitution.” “To make restitution ” (restitution) means to return or pay for something that was stolen, or perhaps to ma ke up for something bad that you did to someone else by giving that person money  or by doing something else for that person.  

Maria then says to the store owner, “Please give hi m a second chance,” meaning allow him another opportunity to do things right. “ Please don’t call the police,” she says. The store owner says, “Well, it’s not the val ue of what he’s stolen that’s important. It’s the fact that he committed an offen se.” “Value” (value) here refers to the price of what the young man stole. It’s how much money something is worth.  

The store owner is not worried about how expensive the item that was stolen is, but rather the fact that this young boy committed a n offense. “To commit an offense” (offense) means to break a law – to do som ething that is against the rules of an organization or the laws of a certain p lace. It’s to commit a crime, in other words. Maria says, “Please let me pay for it and I’ll make sure he never enters your store again. What did he take and how m uch do I owe you?” she says. Maria is asking the store owner how much mone y she has to give the store owner to pay for what her son stole.  

The store owner says, “I told you that it’s not the  cost of the item. It’s the principle.” The store owner is saying, “Well, the p rice isn’t important. It’s the principle” (principle). The “principle” is the beli ef or idea that guides your behavior, that tells you what to do. For example, y ou could have a principle of honesty that tells you never to lie, especially to your girlfriend or your wife or your mother. Of course, I hope you don’t lie to anyone. 

Maria says, “What exactly did my son take?” The sto re owner responds, “He ate a grape.” A “grape” is a very small round or oval f ruit that is usually purple, red, or green. We make grapes into wine. We make wine from grapes, for example. It’s a very, very small thing, one grape. Maria is surpr ised. She says, “One grape?” The store owner says, “Yes, before I stopped him. H e could have eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.” The store owner is concerned that this young boy ate a single grape. He says, “Well, he co uld have eaten the entire fruit stand if I hadn’t been vigilant.”   

 A “fruit stand” (stand) is a small store, basically , that sells fruit, usually outside. It’s not something that is permanent. A fruit stand  is usually something that you can move from one place to another. This man owns a  fruit stand and thinks that this young boy was going to eat all of his fruit be cause he ate a single grape. He says, “He could have eaten the entire” – that is, a ll of the – “fruit stand” if he hadn’t been “vigilant” (vigilant). “To be vigilant”  means to be very careful about dangers or threats around you, to be watching very carefully to make sure nothing bad happens.  

Maria is surprised – shocked, perhaps – by the stor e owner’s reaction. She says, “All this over one grape?” meaning the store owner caused all of this trouble just because her son ate a single grape. The store owner  says, “You should be thanking me for alerting you to this behavior.” “To  alert” (alert) someone is to make someone aware of something – to tell someone a bout something that the person might not have known about, especially if it ’s a danger or a problem.  

The store owner says, “As a parent, you know you ne ed to nip these things in the bud.” The expression “to nip” (nip) something “in t he bud” (bud) means to solve a problem early, when it’s still a small problem, bef ore it becomes more serious or a bigger problem. For example, if someone at your w ork always comes in two minutes late, your boss might decide “to nip the pr oblem in the bud” just in case the person begins to come in 10 minutes late or 20 minutes late. You solve the problem when it’s still small. That’s what the stor e owner is suggesting Maria do for her son.  

He says, “Today it’s a grape,” meaning today his cr ime is stealing a grape, “tomorrow it’s a car.” Maria then sighs – she makes  a sound indicating that she is perhaps not very happy with the store owner. She sa ys, “Okay, how much do I owe you for one grape” – how much money do I need t o give you to pay for the one grape that my son stole? 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
