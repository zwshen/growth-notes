This episode is a dialogue between Nancy and Yasman i about what order you were born in your family – what number you were amo ng your brothers and sisters – and if that’s really important. Let’s get  started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Nancy: Isn’t this a great time of year? Families ge t together over the holidays. 

Yasmani: Maybe it’s nice for some families, but I d read my family get-togethers. 

Nancy: How come? 

Yasmani: I have a big family and there has always b een a lot of sibling rivalry. 

Nancy: I’m sure that was true when you were growing  up, but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you? 

Yasmani: Not us. The firstborn still thinks he’s in  charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family  is still rebellious.  

Nancy: That’s true in a lot of families. 

Yasmani: Yes, but when we get together, we compete to show up the others. We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s rather pathetic, act ually. 

Nancy: How do your parents handle all that? 

Yasmani: They’ve always left us to our own devices.  We just fight it out amongst ourselves. 

Nancy: So, there’s no loving bond between the sibli ngs. 

Yasmani: Oh, we love each other, but we compete wit h other, too. It’s complicated. 

Nancy: Then I should be glad to be an only child? 

Yasmani: That’s right. Count your blessings!

Nancy says to Yasmani, “Isn’t this a great time of year? Families get together over the holidays.” The “holidays” in the United St ates is a term we use to refer to November and December, when there are two major hol idays in the U.S. – or three major holidays in the U.S. – Thanksgiving at the end of November, and then Hanukkah, and Christmas in December.  

Yasmani says, “Maybe it’s nice for some families, b ut I dread my family get- togethers.” “To dread” (dread) means to be worried about something, to not want something to happen. “To dread” is the opposite of “to look forward to.” If you “look forward to” something, you want something to happen. You desire something to happen. “To dread” is the opposite. “T o dread” is to be afraid that something will happen or worried about something th at might happen.  

A “get-together” is a informal gathering of people,  usually for some social reason – a birthday party, a Christmas celebration, or sim ply time for people to come together and relax, talk, and have a good time. The  noun “get-together” comes from the phrasal verb “to get together.” Yasmani dr eads his family get-togethers. Nancy asks, “How come?” “How come” is another way o f saying, “Why?”  

Yasmani responds, “I have a big family and there ha s always been a lot of sibling rivalry.” Your “siblings” (siblings) are your broth ers and sisters. “Sibling” is a general term for brothers and sisters. It’s not tha t common in conversational English. Normally someone will refer to his brother s or his sisters, or say simply, “my brothers and sisters.” But if you want a single  term for that, it would be “sibling.” Your “siblings” are your brothers and si sters. When you say “sibling,” you’re not specifying if it’s a brother or a sister .  

Yasmani says there has always been a lot of “siblin g rivalry.” “Rivalry” (rivalry) refers to competition. We talk about rivalry betwee n two sports teams. There is a rivalry between the San Francisco Giants baseball t eam and the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. When those two teams play, t here’s a lot of emotion involved in the crowd and among the players because  they have always played each other and tried to be the best team, tried to beat the other team. Yasmani says there is rivalry among his siblings, his broth ers and sisters.  

Nancy says, “I’m sure that was true when you were g rowing up,” meaning I’m sure that there was sibling rivalry when you were y ounger, “but you’ve all grown out of it, haven’t you?” “To grow out of” something  means because you’re older, to no longer do something or like something or have  something.  

When I was in high school, sometimes, though not ve ry often, I liked to play video games. But eventually I grew out of it. When I got to college, it no longer interested me anymore. I “grew out of” playing vide o games. Usually we use the expression “to grow out of” something when we’re re ferring to an activity that we associate with children or teenagers or younger peo ple.  

Nancy is saying that surely Yasmani and his sibling s have grown out of all of this rivalry they had when they were children. Yasmani s ays, however, no. He says, “Not us,” meaning no, we have not. “The firstborn s till thinks he’s in charge, the middle children still act up to get attention, and the baby of the family is still rebellious.” The “firstborn” is, unsurprisingly, th e oldest child – the first child to be born in a family.  

“The firstborn still thinks he’s in charge,” Yasman i says. “To be in charge” (charge) means to be in a position of authority or control – to be the person who’s, in effect, the boss, the one who is responsi ble for telling other people what to do. The “middle children” would refer to the chi ldren in a family that has at least three children, who are neither the oldest no r the youngest.  

So, in a family of four children, there is an oldes t child, the youngest child, and then the two other children would be, I guess, the middle children. In my family, where there are 11 children, there are nine middle children, although in my family, we divide our family into the oldest four, the youngest four, and the middle three.  

I, of course, am in the youngest four, and in fact am the “baby” of the family. The “baby” of the family doesn’t refer to someone who i s actually still under two years of age, but rather to the youngest child in the fam ily. It’s often said, however, as a way of indicating that perhaps that youngest child has certain privileges or that  

he’s treated somehow differently – more special, pe rhaps – than the other children. This was never the case for me, of course .  

Yasmani mentions how the middle children in his fam ily “act up” to get attention. “To act up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to b ehave in certain ways, to behave badly so that someone will pay attention to you or will notice you. The baby of the family in Yasmani’s family is “rebellio us” (rebellious). “Rebellious” comes from the verb “to rebel” (rebel). “To rebel” means to resist someone else’s authority – to refuse to do what someone else says you should do, especially someone else in power. Nancy says, “That’s true in a lot of families.”  

Yasmani says, “Yes, but when we get together,” when  my family comes together and is in the same room at the same time, “we compe te to show up the others.” “To show up” someone is a – say it with me – two-wo rd phrasal verb meaning to do or say something to show that you are better tha n another person, you are superior to another person. So, if your son comes h ome from school and says, “I got a B on my test,” and your daughter says, “Well I got an A on my test,” your daughter may be trying to show up your son – to dem onstrate that she is superior to your son.  

Yasmani says, “We brag, argue, and nitpick. It’s ra ther pathetic, actually.” Yasmani says he and his siblings “brag” (brag). “To  brag” means to say something about yourself that makes you look better  than everyone else or to say something that you have done that is wonderful that will make other people think that you are wonderful or successful. There a re, of course, always people who like to brag, who like to talk about how wonder ful they are. Some people think all Americans like to brag. I think that migh t have a little bit of truth in it. 

“To nitpick” (nitpick) means to criticize other peo ple for very small mistakes or faults or errors. To say something is “pathetic” (p athetic) in this case means that it’s so bad you almost feel sorry for the people th at they are so, perhaps, insecure or mean or miserable that they have to act  that way. Sometimes we use this adjective “pathetic” to mean “inadequate” in s uch a way that it’s almost laughable or you almost feel sorry for the person.  

If someone tries to throw a ball 50 feet and the ba ll only goes 10 feet because the person doesn’t know how to throw a ball, you mi ght say, “Well, that was pathetic.” That was really so terrible you almost f eel sorry for the person. Nancy asks, “How do your parents handle all that?” meanin g how do your parents react, how do they view or take care of the situation?  

Yasmani says, “They’ve always left us to our own de vices.” “To leave someone to his own devices” (devices) means to let someone do something without interfering, without doing anything to influence hi s actions or decisions. Often this expression is used when someone does something that  you don’t think is a good idea, or when someone shows bad judgment or makes a  bad decision.  

You might say, for example, “Children, when left to  their own devices, will watch television all day instead of studying for school.”  We’re saying there that if we don’t do anything to influence them or to control t hem perhaps, children will make bad decisions. I’m not saying that’s true, but that ’s one possible use of that expression, and it is typically used when you’re de scribing a situation in which someone doesn’t make a very good decision. 

Yasmani says, We just fight it out amongst ourselve s,” meaning we just fight and our parents don’t do anything about it. Nancy says,  “So there’s no loving bond between the siblings.” A “bond” (bond) here would m ean a close relationship or connection between people. Yasmani says, “Oh, we lo ve each other, but we compete with each other, too. It’s complicated,” he  says, meaning it’s a situation that’s difficult to explain, perhaps.  

Nancy says, “Then I should be glad to be an only ch ild?” If you are an “only child,” you are the only child that your parents ha d. You do not have any brothers and sisters. You have no siblings. Yasmani agrees w ith Nancy. He says yes, you should be glad you are an only child. “Count your b lessings!” he says. The expression “to count your blessings” (blessings) me ans to be grateful for, or appreciative of, the good things that you have.  

Now, interestingly enough, I don’t think anyone who  comes from a larger family would actually say what Yasmani says. I’ve never me t anyone who comes from a family of more than three or four children who thin ks that it would have been better had his family only had one child. But of co urse, I’m the youngest of eleven, so maybe I’m thinking if my parents only ha d one child, it wouldn’t have been me.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
