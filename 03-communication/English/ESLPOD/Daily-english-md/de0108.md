[start of story]

I walked into the coffee room and saw that Brad was  writing something on a piece of paper. When he saw me come in, he slipped the note out of sight.

Trisha: Hey, what's up?

Brad: Oh, nothing.

Trisha: What were you writing?

Brad: (Laugh) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.

Trisha: You mean you're going to ask her out in a n ote? You big chicken!

Brad: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in  person.

Trisha: But, you work with her every day.

Brad: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongu e-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.

Trisha: You've dated a lot. What's so different abo ut Diana?

Brad: Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so  upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great

chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong? Maybe s he's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh fo rget it. This was a bad idea.

Trisha: Well, I guess you don't want this note, the n.

Brad: What note?

Trisha: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorro w night.

Brad: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been s tanding there this entire time and didn't say anything.

Trisha: Sorry. What can I say? Now, do you want the  note or what?

Brad: Yeah, I want the note.

Trisha: Have a great time tomorrow night.

Brad: Thanks. I plan on it.

Our story today is about a man who wants to ask out  someone or ask someone out. “To ask someone out” means to go on a date, a romantic date, with someone, to spend the evening going to a movie or d inner and so forth.

Well, in this story, the woman comes in and sees th at Brad is writing something on a piece of paper. But when she comes in, he “sli ps the note out of sight.” “To slip” (slip) means to put something, but to put it either very quickly or usually underneath or through something. “So, I slipped the  piece of paper under my book.” Well, “out of sight,” as you can guess means  so that no one can see it. “Please keep out of sight” means don’t let anyone s ee you.

The woman, Trisha, says, “Hey, what’s up?” And Brad  says, “Oh, nothing.” That expression, of course, “What’s up?” means how are t hings going, what is new with you? And the common response is either “Not mu ch,” or “Nothing.” It’s possible, of course, to say, “Oh, well, I just won the lottery,” if you won the lottery, but normally, people just say, “Oh not much.” It’s similar to when people ask, “How are you?” They’re not really asking how you ar e, they’re just being polite. So, you are supposed to say, “Oh, I’m fine.”

Well, Brad says that Trisha, his friend, “caught hi m in the act.” He said, “You caught me in the act.” That means that I was in the  middle of doing something that probably I should not have been doing. So, I w as either doing  something wrong or doing something that I should not do, that  I didn’t want you to know about. For example, if I’m going to buy my wife a p resent and I want to surprise her and I’m wrapping the present up – I’m putting p aper on it so it looks nice – the box looks nice. And she comes in the room while  I’m wrapping the present. I was trying to keep it secret from her and so I coul d say, “Oh, you caught me in the act,” meaning I didn’t want you to know about t his.

Brad says that he’s “working up the nerve” to ask D iana out. “To work up your nerve” or “to work up the nerve” means to get the c ourage, to feel like you can do it without being nervous. I’m working up the nerve to ask my boss for a raise. I need some courage, some strength to do that.

Well, Trisha finds out that Brad is writing a note to ask Diana out on a date, and she calls him a “big chicken.” When someone says, “ Oh, you’re chicken” they mean you’re afraid, you’re scared. You won’t do som ething because you’re not strong enough. “Don’t be a chicken” means don’t be scared, don’t be afraid. And Brad says that “yes, I’m a wuss.” A “wuss” (wuss) is an informal expression which means I’m a weak person. It’s the same as chi cken. It’s a little more – something that an adult would say to someone in an informal context. Chicken is something that little kids can say. Little children  even might say that, but “wuss” is something a little stronger that would probably onl y be used by an adult.

Brad says that he doesn’t want to do it, to ask Dia na out, “in person,” meaning face to face – by talking to her, by going up to he r and talking to her with her standing right in front of him. So, when we say, “I ’m going to be there in person” means I’m not just going to call or email, I’m phys ically going to be present. Brad says that even though he works with Diana every day , when he’s working, he’s in a different “frame of mind.” A “frame of mind” is y our attitude, the way that you see things. “I’m in a working frame of mind,” meani ng right now, I want to work. That’s what I’m thinking about, that’s what I’m con centrating or focusing on. “He is in a different frame of mind,” meaning he’s thin king about work, not about personal relationships. He says that when he tries to ask her out, he often gets “tongue-tied.” The expression “tongue-tied” – “tong ue (tongue) – “tied” (tied) – means that you can’t think of the right thing to say or you can’t speak very clearly. This often happens to men in the presence of women who they are interested in. They become “tongue-tied.” I know I do. Well, I did because I’m married now. So, I don’t ask other women out.

The man says that he can’t get the words out withou t turning “beet red.” The expression “to get the words out,” means, of course , to talk. So, what he’s saying is I can’t talk without turning “beet (beet) red.” Well, “beet” – a “beet” (beet) is a vegetable that is very red and that expression is c ommon in English. He turned “beet red,” meaning he turned – his face became as red as a beet. Well, Brad is asked by Trisha why this woman is so different from  other women that he has dated, and Brad says, “Well, for one thing, she’s g orgeous.” “To be gorgeous” (gorgeous) means to be very beautiful, to be extrem ely beautiful. I tell my wife that she is gorgeous and she is.

Brad also says the woman he’s interested in is “upb eat and sweet.” “To be upbeat” – one word – (upbeat) means to be happy. So meone who always looks on the positive side, who’s optimistic, that would be “upbeat.” “To be sweet” here, when a man says a girl is sweet or a woman can also  describe a man as being sweet (sweet) – it means they’re nice, they’re kind , they’re gentle. “Sweet,” of course, also is a word we use with candy, something  with sugar in it is sweet. So, similar idea – they’re nice.

Brad also says that he thinks that he and this woma n, Diana, have “great chemistry together.” “To have great chemistry” – “c hemistry” is (chemistry) – means that they get along very well, that they are very compatible, that they laugh together, and they understand each other, and  they seem to be interested in each other, also, romantically – often, that’s the meaning. We say, “Those people have no chemistry” – means they don’t seem to really be interested in each other, really understand each other.

Well, Brad says that he thinks that the woman may b e nice to him “out of courtesy” and doesn’t think of him that way. “Out of courtesy” – “courtesy” is (courtesy) – is to be polite. So, it’s politeness. So, when someone says, “You should do that out of courtesy” – means to be polit e, that if you want to be nice, polite, you should do that. He says that the woman doesn’t “think of him that way.” When you say, “Oh, she doesn’t think of me th at way” we mean she’s not interested in you romantically or she doesn’t see y ou as someone she could be romantically interested in. So, that’s the meaning of “that way,” meaning in a romantic way. Well, as it turns out, it happens tha t the woman has asked Brad to go to an office party by giving him a note. The “of fice party” would be, of course, be a party for a company – it’s your company party.

Well, Trisha, Brad’s friend, has been giving him a “hard time,” meaning she has been calling him a chicken and coward and making hi m feel badly for writing a note, but the woman that he’s interested in, Diana,  wrote him a note to ask him to

go to a party. And, of course, Brad isn’t very happ y that Trisha didn’t tell him this right away. He says, “I can’t believe you’ve been s tanding there this entire time” – or “standing here this entire time,” meaning all of  this time. Trisha then says, “Well, do you want the note or what?” That expressi on “Do you want to go or what?” – the “or what?” means “or not.” It’s slight ly informal. It’s usually when you are trying to get an answer out of a person and you  may be a little impatient. “Are you coming to the store with me or what?” – you mig ht say to your girlfriend or boyfriend who doesn’t seem like they want to go or who won’t give you an answer right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
