This episode is a dialogue between Emil and Tammy a bout things you might eat for breakfast. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Emil: Look at this breakfast buffet. Wow, I’ve died  and gone to heaven! 

Tammy: I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fruit, a nd a bagel. 

Emil: What?! How can you pass up this amazing buffe t? I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. 

Tammy: I don’t normally eat a big breakfast. If I’m  still hungry after this, I’ll have some pancakes. 

Emil: Pancakes! I’m going to have some pancakes whe n I’m done with this first round, plus some waffles and French toast. 

Tammy: Well, more power to you. I can’t imagine any one eating more than what’s already on your plate. 

Emil: I’ve only just begun. After the pancakes, waf fles, and French toast, I think I’ll have an omelet and some biscuits and gravy. I might even have room for one or two of those doughnuts. 

Tammy: You’re not serious.  

Emil: I’m dead serious.  

Tammy: You sound like you’re planning on staying he re all morning. 

Emil: That’s right. Do you want to meet me back her e for the lunch buffet?

Emil says to Tammy at the beginning of our dialogue , “Look at this breakfast buffet.” “Breakfast,” you probably know, is a meal that you eat in the morning. It’s the first meal of the day. If you look up the word,  you can see why we use it. The word “fast” (fast) means quick, but it can also mea n not to eat food. So “break/fast” would be to break – or end – your fast . And of course, when you’re sleeping, you’re not eating, so when you wake up, y ou have in a sense been fasting.  

A “buffet” (buffet) is a meal in a restaurant where  you can take as much food as you want. Usually the restaurant will have a number  of different dishes, a number of different kinds of food, and you can take your p late and put as much food as you want onto your plate to eat. These sometimes ar e called “all-you-can-eat” buffets, because typically you can eat as much as y ou want.  

Emil is telling Tammy to look at the breakfast buff et where they are. He says, “Wow, I’ve died and gone to heaven!” That expressio n, “I’ve died (died) and gone to heaven,” means that you are very happy, as if yo u were to die and then go up to heaven and be happy forever and ever. So, when s omeone says, “I’ve died and gone to heaven,” he means “I’m extremely happy.  This is the best possible situation.” Usually we say this when we are given o r have the opportunity to do something – or in this case, eat something that you  really love.  

Tammy says, “I think I’ll just grab some cereal, fr uit, and a bagel.” “Cereal” (cereal) is very popular as an American breakfast. There are lots of different varieties of cereal. Usually cereal comes in small little pieces that you put into a bowl and put milk into, and then you eat the cereal  with a spoon. It’s a very common breakfast because it’s easy to make. You don ’t have to cook anything.  

Tammy says she’s going to “grab,” or take, “some ce real, fruit, and a bagel.” A “bagel” (bagel) is a round piece of chewy bread. It  sort of looks like a doughnut because there’s a hole in the middle. However, it i s hard – that is, it’s not soft like a doughnut. It’s what we would call “chewy” (chewy)  bread because you have to move your mouth up and down several times in order to chew it. Bagels are usually served with something on top of them. You p ut on something like cream cheese.  

Emil says, “What? How can you pass up this amazing buffet?” Emil is surprised that Tammy just wants to have a little bit of food,  because of course when you have a buffet, you can eat as much as you want. So,  Emil doesn’t understand why Tammy would just want cereal, fruit, and a bage l. He says, “How can you pass up this amazing buffet?” The phrasal verb “to pass up” means to decide not to do something, not to have something.  

Emil says, “I’m starting with some bacon, scrambled  eggs, and hash browns.” “Bacon” is meat from a pig, that is very fatty. It has a lot of fat in it. It’s cut into very thin strips, or slices, that usually you cook in a pan. It’s really good. I love bacon myself. “Scrambled eggs” is a way of preparin g eggs. You take two eggs that are raw, that are not cooked, and you blend th em together. You could also take three eggs or however many eggs you want. You blend the eggs together, and then you put them in a frying pan to cook them.  That’s called “scrambled (scrambled) eggs.”  

“Hash (hash) browns” are basically potatoes that yo u chop up and cook in a frying pan. Hash browns are usually served at break fast along with eggs and bacon. It’s basically a potato dish that you eat fo r breakfast. Tammy says, “I don’t normally eat a big breakfast. If I’m still hungry a fter this,” meaning after she eats her cereal, fruit, and bagel, “I’ll have some panca kes.” “Pancakes” (pancakes) are flat cakes made of flour that are cooked in a h ot frying pan.  

Emil says, “Pancakes! I’m going to have some pancak es when I’m done with this first round, plus some waffles and French toast.” T he word “round” (round) here refers to one of many different events, or differen t parts of an event. In the sport of boxing, where two people get up and basically hi t each other, we have “rounds” – those are parts of the competition. Usua lly there are a number of different rounds, each of which are a couple of min utes long.  

Emil is referring to the number of times he’s going  to go up to the buffet and get more food. He calls these “rounds.” He’s going to h ave waffles and French toast. A “waffle” (waffle) is a square piece of basically sweet bread that usually is served with butter and a liquid kind of sugar calle d “syrup.” It’s also very popular for breakfast in the United States.  

“French toast” is a breakfast item made by taking a  piece of toast and putting the toast into a mixture of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and s ometimes vanilla. You take a piece of bread and you put it into this mixture and  then you heat up the bread on both sides in a hot pan. That’s called “French toas t,” although I don’t know if it’s French or not. Tammy says, “Well, more power to you .” “More power to” someone is a phrase we use to express our good wish es and perhaps admiration  

toward another person. You’re basically saying, “We ll, good for you. That’s just great.”  

Tammy says, “I can’t imagine anyone eating more tha n what’s already on your plate.” Tammy is surprised that Emil is going to wa nt even more food than what he already has. Emil says, however, “I’ve only just  begun,” meaning I’m just getting started eating breakfast. “After the pancak es, waffles, and French toast, I think I’ll have an omelet and some biscuits and gra vy. I might even have room for one or two of those doughnuts.”  

An “omelet” (omelet) is a breakfast food made from eggs that are mixed usually with some other ingredient. It could be vegetables;  it could be meat; it could be cheese, or some combination of those three. You mix  the eggs together, usually with milk, and you put that mixture into a hot pan and the eggs begin to cook. Then you put the other ingredients, the other thing s you want in your omelet, on top and you fold the omelet over so it looks like a  half-circle or semicircle.  

“Biscuits” (biscuits) are round rolls, a kind of br ead. “Gravy” (gravy) is a thick, usually meat-based sauce – a thick liquid that is m ade from some kind of meat. In some places, especially in the southern United S tates, having “biscuits and gravy” is popular for breakfast.  

Finally, Emil says he may also have some doughnuts.  A “doughnut” (doughnut) is a round piece of sweet bread that has a hole in the  middle. But unlike a bagel, which looks like a doughnut, it is fried and covere d usually in some sort of sugar coating or frosting. Doughnuts are also very popula r with some people for breakfast. American cities have lots of what are ca lled “doughnut shops” – places where you can go and buy all different kinds of dou ghnuts. I’m really getting hungry right now talking about all this food.  

Tammy says to Emil, “You’re not serious.” She doesn ’t really believe that Emil is going to eat all this food. Emil says, however, “I’ m dead serious.” When someone says he is “dead (dead) serious,” he means he’s ver y serious. He’s not joking. Usually we use this expression when someone doesn’t  believe we are being serious. If you say to your co-worker, “You’re not really going to leave the office right now and go to the beach, are you?” Your co-wo rker might say, “I’m dead serious,” meaning “Yes, I’m not joking. That’s real ly what I’m going to do.” 

Tammy says, “You sound like you’re planning on stay ing here all morning,” meaning you’re going to stay at the restaurant all morning and eat. Emil says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “Do you wan t to meet me back here for the lunch buffet?” Emil suggests that Tammy come back l ater in the afternoon so that  

she can join him for another buffet, for lunch. Buf fets are very popular for lunch as well as for breakfast – perhaps even more popula r for lunch.  

There are, here in Los Angeles, restaurants that se rve Indian food. There are lots of Indian buffets. There are lots of Chinese buffet s, where you can go and get all sorts of Chinese food and eat as much as you want. These are “all-you-can-eat” buffets. Maybe this is one reason why Americans, on  average, are so overweight. They go to all of these all-you-can-eat  buffets all the time.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
