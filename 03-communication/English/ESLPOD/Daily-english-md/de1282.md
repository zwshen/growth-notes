# Working in a Scientific Field

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,282 – Working in a Scientific Field.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,282. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Shirley and Ira about working in a job related to science.

Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ira: It’s amazing that everybody in your family wor ks in the sciences.

Shirley: Yeah, my parents are both in the social sc iences. My father is a psychologist and my mother is an economist.

Ira: And your sister Shonda?

Shirley: She’s an astronomer. She initially wanted to study physics, but changed her mind. Her partner is a geologist.

Ira: Is your brother also in astronomy?

Shirley: No, he’s a biologist and his wife does che mistry research.

Ira: How about your other brother? What does he do?

Shirley: Um, we don’t . . . I mean he’s not involve d in the social sciences, life sciences, or physical sciences.

Ira: If I remember correctly, he was always good at  math and liked computers. Is he in computer science?

Shirley: No, he’s not. All right, he’s a writer, bu t we have every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.

 Ira starts our dialogue by saying, “It’s amazing th at everybody in your family works in the sciences.” The word “sciences” (scienc es) – in the plural form – usually refers to different areas, what we call “fi elds (fields) of study,” including areas of the academic or research world that look a t natural and physical sciences. Shirley says, “Yeah,” which is an informa l way of saying yes. “My parents are both in the social sciences.”

Now, I just defined “the sciences” as relating to t he physical and natural world. Part of the natural world includes people, of cours e, and that means that the sciences also includes the study of human beings an d how they interact with each other. The “social (social) sciences” are scie nces that study human beings and their interactions, things that would include s ociology and psychology, anthropology – some people perhaps would also inclu de history, although history, according to some people, is more like ano ther area of study called “the humanities,” which would include the study of art a nd literature.

In any case, the social sciences includes things su ch as psychology and economics. Shirley says, “My father is a psychologi st,” someone who studies the human mind, and her mother “is an economist,” someo ne who studies the way money is made and the way that human beings relate to each other when it comes to selling and buying things. Ira says, “And your sister Shonda?” Shirley replies that her sister is an “astronomer” (astrono mer). An astronomer is a person who studies the planets and the stars and other obj ects out in what we would call “outer space” – the area beyond the Earth.

Shirley says that her sister “initially,” meaning a t the beginning, perhaps at the beginning of her studies, “wanted to study physics,  but changed her mind.” “Physics” (physics) is the study of physical object s and how they move and are influenced by natural forces such as gravity and ma gnetism. Her sister “changed her mind,” meaning she changed her opinion. She dec ided to do something different, in this case.

“Her partner is a geologist,” Shirley says. A “part ner” (partner) can mean someone with whom you run a business. A “business p artner” is a person with whom you have a share of or share responsibility in  a business. More recently, the word “partner” has been used to describe someon e with whom you are in a romantic relationship with. I’m not sure if this or iginally came from British English. I used to notice it in British English a few years ago. It has become more popular in American English more recently.

A “partner” is a general term for either your boyfr iend, your girlfriend, your husband, or your wife. I don’t think there are any other possibilities there, at least within the human race. In any case, that’s a “partn er.” Not one of my favorite words. I prefer people just say what they mean. If you mean your boyfriend, then say your boyfriend. Anyway, that’s my own personal complaint.

A “geologist” (geologist) is a person who studies t he earth – what the earth is made of, things inside of the earth like rocks. I h ad a good friend from high school who wanted to be a geologist. He even starte d a master’s program in geology, but he decided not to continue studying it . This was back in the late 1980s, the mid-1980s – 1986, 1987. He decided there  wasn’t any money in geology and so he changed his focus to computers.

Now, I think if he were to make the same decision a gain he might continue in his studies of geology. Geologists, at least in the Uni ted States, are often employed, or given jobs, in the new oil industry – the oil bu sinesses that have grown so much in the past 20 years in the U.S. In any case, Shirley’s sister’s boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife is a geologist.

Ira says, “Is your brother also in astronomy?” Shir ley says, “No, he’s a biologist and his wife does chemistry research.” A “biologist ” (biologist) is a scientist who studies living organisms – plants and animals, for example. When I first moved to California, I lived with a couple of biologists who  were getting their PhD in biology from Claremont College – Claremont University or so mething. I don’t remember very well. It was a long time ago.

Anyway, in our story, Shirley’s brother’s wife – th at would make her Shirley’s sister-in-law – works in the field or the area of “ chemistry” (chemistry). “Chemistry” is the study of what materials are made  of and how the elements of the materials interact and relate to each other. Ch emistry studies things like small molecules, and what’s inside the molecules, and wha t the molecules are made of – how the different elements react to each other. I ra says, “How about your other brother?” meaning tell me about your other brother.  “What does he do?”

Shirley says, “Um, we don’t . . . I mean he’s not i nvolved in the social sciences, life sciences, or physical sciences.” Shirley doesn ’t want to talk about the other brother she has. I guess because he’s not in “the s ocial sciences, life (life) sciences,” or physical sciences. “Life sciences” are those fields that study any kind of life. That would include biology, zoology, botany, biochemistry, microbiology – those are all life sciences. The phy sical sciences are things like chemistry and geology and physics and astronomy.

Ira says, “If I remember correctly, he” – meaning S hirley’s brother – “was always good at math and liked computers.” “Math” (math) is  a short form of the word “mathematics.” In British English, they put an “s” at the end. They say “maths,” but we say “math” without the “s.” Ira asks, “Is he ,” meaning your brother, “in computer science?” “Computer science” is of course the study of computers. Shirley says, “No he’s not.”

Then she says, “All right,” in a way that indicates  that she didn’t really want to talk about him but now she will. “All right, he’s a writ er,” she says. A “writer” (writer) is, of course, a person whose job is to create thin gs by writing them – by typing them or writing them down. Nowadays, of course, eve ryone does it on a computer. A writer could be someone who writes fict ion, such as stories, or poetry. A writer could be someone who writes for a newspaper or writes books about things that are real.

Shirley says, “We,” meaning she and her family, “ha ve every confidence that he’ll grow out of it.” Shirley says that she and her fami ly hope that their brother will “grow out of it.” That’s what she means when she sa ys they have “every confidence” (confidence). “To have every confidence  of” something, or “to have every confidence that” something, means that you ha ve no doubts – that you are sure something will happen in the future. What Shirley and her family are sure of is that the  brother, who is a writer, will “grow out of it.”

The expression “to grow out of” something means to become older and wiser, or more mature, so that you’re no longer interested in  this particular area or that you no longer have certain problems that we normally as sociate with, or think are related to, someone’s young age. As we grow older, we grow out of some of the things that we liked when we were children. Shirley  and her family don’t believe that being a writer is a very good thing, and that’ s why they hope that the brother in the family will grow out of his love of writing,  I guess.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

We hope our writer never grows out of her love of w riting dialogues. Thanks to Dr. Lucy Tse for today’s dialogue.
