Fay:  Thanks.  Dustin:  Are you traveling on business?  Fay:  Yes, I am.  I’m changing planes in Denver on my way to South Carolina, and then I’m off to Georgia on Wednesday.  There’s no rest for the wicked.    Dustin:  That’s a lot of traveling.  Doesn’t your husband or boyfriend mind?  Fay:  Oh, I’m not married or seeing anyone.  How about you?  Where are you headed?

Fay:  No, I was born and raised in Kentucky, but I’ve been living in L.A. for the past four years.  What part of L.A. do you live in?  Dustin:  I live not too far from the airport in Westchester.  Have you heard of it?
