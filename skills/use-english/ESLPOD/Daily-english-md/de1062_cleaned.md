This episode is a dialogue between Iris and Alex ab out remaining unmarried. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Iris: I’m thinking of inviting Simone and Jerry ove r for dinner. 

Alex: This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking, is  it? Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become in volved in a relationship. 

Iris: He’s not a confirmed bachelor. In this neighb orhood, with so many single women, he’s an eligible bachelor.  

Alex: You mean in this neighborhood full of old spi nsters! Stop trying to set him up with one of them. 

Iris: How do you know he doesn’t want a relationshi p? Maybe he’s just shy and needs a little prodding. Maybe he has a fear of com mitment and we can all help him overcome it. 

Alex: Maybe he just wants to be left alone by meddl ing neighbors and ladies on the prowl. There are many benefits to remaining a b achelor.  

Iris: You mean living a celibate and empty life? 

Alex: You’re making too many assumptions. You don’t  know the first thing about his life and whether he’s happy or not. In many way s, a bachelor’s life is idyllic. 

Iris: How can you say that? 

Alex: Would any bachelor have to have this conversa tion with anyone, ever?

We’re listening to a conversation between Iris and Alex. Iris begins by saying, “I’m thinking of inviting Simone and Jerry over for  dinner.” Alex says, “This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking is it?” Iris wants t o invite a couple of friends over to have dinner, but Alex suspects – he thinks – tha t what she’s really doing is trying to be a matchmaker.  

“To matchmake” (matchmake) means to try to introduc e one person – one single person, one unmarried person – to another person th at you think they might like. So, this is what “matchmaking” is, and in some cult ures there are matchmakers who help arrange marriages, help young people find each other. This is done, of course, informally in all cultures. Your parents tr y to introduce you to a nice girl or a nice boy that they think you may want to marry. 

Alex says, “Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become involved in a relationship.” One of the two people that Iris wants to invite to dinner is Jerry. But according to Alex, Jerry is  a “confirmed bachelor.” A “bachelor” (bachelor) is a man who is not married a nd typically is not in involved in a romantic relationship – one who chooses to liv e alone. A “confirmed bachelor” would be a man who has probably decided h e’s never going to marry.  

Iris says, “He’s not a confirmed bachelor,” referri ng to Jerry, of course. “In this neighborhood, with so many single women, he’s an el igible bachelor.” The term “eligible (eligible) bachelor” refers to a man who is not in a relationship, who is not married but would be a desirable partner – some one who a woman would want to marry, perhaps because he has a lot of mone y and/or he’s good-looking. I was neither of those things when I got married. I ’m still neither of those things.  

Alex says, “You mean in this neighborhood full of o ld spinsters!” Alex uses the word “spinsters” (spinsters) to describe older unma rried women who are considered by some too old to get married. The word  “spinster” is a very negative way of describing an older unmarried woman. I certa inly would not recommend using that term, but it was popular many years ago.  Alex is using it as an insult here. He’s insulting the women who live in that nei ghborhood, saying that they would not be good matches for Jerry.  

Alex says to Iris, “Stop trying to set him up with one of them.” “To set someone up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to arrange f or someone to meet a potential romantic partner. It’s similar to matchma king. To set someone up is to try to get someone to go out on a date with another  person when you think the two people might be interested romantically in each  other.  

I was set up once for a date, what we would call in  this instance a “blind (blind) date.” A blind date is when you don’t know the othe r person, but you both know someone who sets you up, who arranges for you to go  on a date. I did this once and it didn’t work out very well. My father and mot her, however, met on a blind date, and they had 11 children, so sometimes it wor ks. Just not for me.  

Alex is telling Iris that she should stop trying to  set Jerry up with these women. Iris says, “How do you know he doesn’t want a relat ionship? Maybe he” – Jerry – “he’s just shy and needs a little prodding.” “To pr od (prod) someone” is to encourage someone to do something, to sort of push them to do something. Iris says, “Maybe he has a fear of commitment and we can  all help him overcome it.”  

A “fear of commitment” is a feeling of worry and an xiety when you think about, in this case, spending your entire life with another p erson. You might decide that you are too afraid to get married, to be in a long- term romantic relationship. That’s a fear of commitment. The word “commitment” comes from the verb “to commit,” which means to promise to do something, to  agree to do something. A fear of commitment would be the opposite – that you  don’t want to commit to anyone. Iris thinks that she and Alex can help Jerr y to overcome his fear of commitment.  

“To overcome” (overcome) means to deal with a diffi cult problem or to solve a difficult problem, especially after a very long tim e of being challenged by the problem. There was a famous song of the civil right s movement in the 1960s in the United States, “We Shall Overcome,” meaning we will eventually solve this problem. We will eventually be able to, in the case  of the African-American community in the United States, be free of the disc rimination that they were experiencing at that time.  

But the verb “to overcome” can be used in any circu mstance where you have a very difficult situation, one that is perhaps long- lasting, where you eventually succeed. You solve the problem or get over the prob lem. Alex says, “Maybe he just wants to be left alone by meddling neighbors a nd ladies on the prowl.” “Meddling” (meddling) means being involved in other  people’s private affairs, especially when those people don’t want this person  involved in their affairs. “To  

meddle” as a verb means to get involved in things, especially private matters that don’t concern you, that you shouldn’t be involved i n.  

That’s what Alex thinks Iris is doing. He’s meddlin g in the personal affairs of Jerry. He says that he thinks Jerry “just wants to be left alone by meddling neighbors,” meaning he doesn’t want people botherin g him in this way. He also wants to be left alone by “ladies on the prowl” (pr owl). “To be on the prowl” means to be looking for something, searching for so mething. It’s often used in the dating world, if we could call it that, to refe r to someone who is looking for a romantic or sexual partner.  

Alex says, “There are many benefits” – many good th ings – “to remaining a bachelor.” Iris says, “You mean living a celibate a nd empty life?” “Celibate” (celibate) means deciding not to have sexual relati ons with another person – often, but not always, for religious reasons. Iris obviously thinks that being celibate means having an empty life. This is rather  a prejudiced opinion on Iris’s part, but I suppose some people do think that.  

Alex says, “You’re making too many assumptions.” “A ssumptions” (assumptions) are things that you believe to be true even though you often don’t have any proof or evidence that they are true. Alex says, “You don ’t know the first thing about his life.” “To not know the first thing” about someone is to be completely unfamiliar with someone or something. I could say, “I don’t kn ow the first thing about repairing or fixing my computer.” I don’t know what  to do. I’m completely ignorant. That would be a true statement.  

Alex says, “In many ways, a bachelor’s life is idyl lic.” “Idyllic” (idyllic) means perfect, very happy, enjoyable. To say the bachelor  life is “idyllic” is to describe it as though it were the best situation you could be i n, and that’s what Alex is saying. Iris is puzzled. She doesn’t agree. She say s, “How can you say that?” meaning “How is it possible for you to think that w ay? What are your reasons for thinking that way?”  

Alex says, “Would any bachelor have to have this co nversation with anyone, ever?” What Alex is saying here in the last line of  the dialogue is that the very fact that he has to have this conversation with his  wife is an indication of the good side of being a bachelor – in other words, he wouldn’t have to argue with his wife if he were a bachelor, and bachelors don’t  have to argue with anyone because they don’t have anyone to argue with. In so me ways, Alex is perhaps making a joke here, since he and Iris are married.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
