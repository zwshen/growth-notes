This episode is a dialogue about types of allergies  – a medical condition that you don’t want to have. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bert: Doctor, give it to me straight. Is my medical  condition serious?

Doctor: I suspect that your rashes and other sympto ms are the result of allergies.

Bert: Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of seri ous disease.

Doctor: Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give  you tests to see what you’re allergic to.

Bert: You mean I might have allergies to more than one thing?

Doctor: There are many kinds of allergies. Some peo ple have food allergies and have adverse reactions when they ingest or even com e near some types of food.

Bert: That sounds terrible. I hope I don’t have foo d allergies. I would have to restrict my diet.

Doctor: Other people have seasonal allergies to pol len from trees, grasses, and weeds.

Bert: That would mean I couldn’t do some types of o utdoor activities.

Doctor: Many people are allergic to pets, most comm only cat or dog dander.

Bert: Oh no, I’d have to get rid of my three cats o r dog!

 Doctor: You might also be allergic to dust mites, i nsect bites, or even mold spores in your home.

Bert: You mean I might have to move out of my house ?

Doctor: If mold is detected in your home, you might  need to move out temporarily while the mold is removed.

Bert: Are you sure I don’t have some kind of diseas e? I think I’d prefer that to allergies!

[end of dialogue]

Bert begins by saying to his doctor, “Doctor, give it to me straight.” The expression “Give it to me straight” (straight) mean s tell me directly without trying to make something sound better than it is, without hesitating. Usually we use this expression when you think the person is going to te ll you something bad or is going to give you bad news, especially bad news abo ut you – in this case, about your health.

So when Bert says, “Give it to me straight,” he mea ns tell me whatever the bad news is right away. Don’t try to make me feel good about it or change it in some way to make it seem less serious than it really is.  He then asks, “Is my medical condition serious?” Your “medical condition” is som ething that is causing you to be in poor health, something that is making you sic k or ill. The doctor says, “I suspect that your rashes and other symptoms are the  result of allergies.”

A “rash” (rash) is a red, bumpy area on your skin that is often itchy – one that causes you to want to take your fingers and move yo ur fingers over that area of your skin. We would use the verb “to scratch” (scra tch). “To scratch your skin” is to take your fingers, the end of your fingers – you r “fingernails,” specifically – and move them back and forth over an area of your skin.

Bert has rashes on his skin. The doctor thinks thes e are a result of “allergies” (allergies). An “allergy” is a condition that cause s you to react badly when you are in the presence of some substance. For example,  if you have an allergy to, say, “dust” – small little pieces of dirt – you mig ht sneeze or your eyes might begin to water. If you have an allergy to a certain  kind of food, you may have difficulty breathing after you eat that food, or yo u might get rashes on your skin.

People have allergies to all sorts of substances. S ome people have allergies to peanuts or other kinds of food. Some people have al lergies to cats and dogs and other animals. The adjective that comes from allerg y is “allergic” (allergic). Someone may say, “I am allergic to cats” – that mea ns that person has an allergy to cats – or “I am allergic to my mother-in-law.” W henever my mother-in-law is here, I start to feel sick.

Bert says, “Allergies?! I thought I had some kind of serious disease.” A “disease” (disease) is an illness – something that makes you sick. Clearly, Bert doesn’t think that having an allergy to something is very s erious. But the doctor says, “Allergies can be serious. I’m going to give you te sts to see what you’re allergic to.” Notice again that expression, “allergic to.”

Bert says, “You mean I might have allergies to more  than one thing?” The doctor says, “There are many kinds of allergies. Some peop le have food allergies and have adverse reactions when they ingest or even com e near some types of food.” A “food allergy” is obviously an allergy tha t causes you to have a bad reaction – an “adverse reaction” – to certain kinds  of food. “Adverse” (adverse) means the same here as bad or harmful.

When some people eat shrimp or other kinds of shell fish, they may have difficulty breathing or they may get rashes on their skin. I h ave an allergy to seafood, to shrimp in particular, and if I eat shrimp, I get re d patches on my skin – rashes. The verb “to ingest” (ingest) means to eat or drink  something.

Bert says, “That sounds terrible. I hope I don’t ha ve food allergies. I would have to restrict my diet.” “To restrict (restrict) your diet (diet)” means to avoid certain kinds of food or to limit how much food you eat, es pecially in response to some sort of medical condition. If you are gaining too m uch weight and that is causing physical or health problems, you may have to restri ct your diet – avoid, say, bread and pasta and candies and cookies, or change how much you eat at every meal.

The doctor says, “Other people have seasonal allerg ies to pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds.” “Seasonal” (seasonal) refers to the four seasons of the year – winter, spring, summer, and fall. “Seasonal allergies” are allergies that bother you only during certain times of the year. T hese are often related to “pollen” (pollen). Pollen is a small substance – a “powder,” we would call it – that is produced within the flower of a plant.

Pollen is part of a plant’s reproductive cycle. It’ s how the plant spreads, how you get new plants from that same plant. Well, pollen, when you breathe it in, can

cause problems for some people if you have an aller gy to that pollen. Pollen can come from trees. It can come from “grasses” – thing s that grow out of the ground that are tall and thin, or it can come from “weeds”  (weeds).

The word “weed” refers to a plant that you don’t wa nt. It isn’t so much a scientific classification as it is one that we use to refer to  certain kinds of plants that we don’t want versus the ones that we do. Weeds are al most always what we would call “wild (wild) plants.” They’re not plants that you put there. They are plants that are just in the area where you live and happen to g row up on your property or where you have other plants growing. We refer to th ese in the plural as “weeds.” One of them would be “a weed.”

Don’t confuse this with another kind of plant, whic h is “weed” without the article, definite or indefinite, in front of it. If you talk  about “weed” without saying “a weed” or “the weeds” or “weeds,” plural, you’re referring  to “marijuana.” It’s an informal term for marijuana. Someone says, “You want to smok e some weed?” That person is asking you if you want to smoke some mari juana. And if it’s not legal to, you should probably say no. But “weeds,” plural, or  “a weed” or “the weed” refers to a wild plant.

Bert says, “That would mean I couldn’t do some type s of outdoor activities” – that is, if you were allergic to certain kinds of pollen . The doctor says, “Many people are allergic to pets, most commonly cat or dog dand er.” “Dander” (dander) are small pieces of skin that come off of the skin of a  cat or dog. Bert says, “Oh no, I’d have to get rid of my three cats or dog!” Bert apparently has three cats and a dog. If he’s allergic to cats or dogs, he may have to get rid of the cats or dogs. Let’s hope it’s the cats.

The doctor says, “You might also be allergic to dus t mites, insect bites, or even mold spores in your home.” The doctor lists three o ther things that people are commonly allergic to. The first is “dust (dust) mit es (mites).” “Dust” is small pieces of dirt. A “mite” (mite) is a small little b ug that can live in your house, and some people are allergic to those bugs. An “insect”  (insect) is a small bug that often has wings on it. An “insect bite” (bite) is w hen that insect lands on your skin and tries to get into your skin. It bites your skin .

“Mold” (mold) here refers to a kind of fungus. Mold  can grow on cheese, for example. Mold can grow on the outside of a tree. Mold usually requires a warm, wet area. A “mold spore” (spore) is similar to poll en from a tree. It’s the part of a mold organism that can be used to spread to other a reas and produce more mold. Again, some people have an allergy to mold or  mold spores, and that can cause a problem. Bert says, “You mean I might have to move out of my house?”

Mold is sometimes found in people’s houses, especia lly in warm, damp areas such as a bathroom.

The doctor says, “If mold is detected in your home,  you might need to move out temporarily while the mold is removed.” “Detected” (detected) comes from the verb “to detect” (detect), which means “to find.” S o, if mold is “detected” in your home, mold has been found in your home. It’s presen t in your house. You need to remove the mold, and that sometimes requires you  to leave your house “temporarily,” for a short time, while they come in  and get rid of the mold.

Bert says, “Are you sure I don’t have some other ki nd of disease? I think I’d prefer that to allergies!” Bert is saying that he w ould prefer to have another kind of disease other than allergies.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
