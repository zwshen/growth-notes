<body><h1><center>Problem A : MiniMice</center></h1>
<h3>Time Limit : 6 seconds</h3>
<div align="justify">
	Welcome to the world of mice. All mice have IDs. They are numbered orderly according to 
their seniority from 1. These mice live in groups. Mice of a same group have continuous ids.  
	Mini, the mice captain (ID 0) has called mice of specific group(IDs a to b) for a session. 
He wanted to make a circle formation with those mice. 
	But mice have a property : The Degree of quarrel. When 2 mice are near they quarrel to 
an extent that is proportional to the difference in the number of factors of their individual ids. 
For example when 2 mice of ids 4 and 24 are near they quarrel 5 units(say). 
Number of factors of 4 – 3(1,2,4). 24 – 8 (1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24).  
Also the strength of quarrel affects the neighbourhood. 
	So, Mini, the mice captain wants to minimize the strength of the maximum quarrel 
in that circle by arranging the mice appropriately. Note that the circle formation is mandatory.
			Help Mini , the mice caption to MiniMice the quarrel.<br>

<h3>Input:</h3><br>
	First line contains number of test cases.<br>
	Each test case is represented by a space separated list of 2 ids representing 
the group of mice "a<space>b" .	All mice with ids a<=id<=b are present in the session.
	1 <= a <= 4999999 ;  a < b <= 5000000.
<br>
<h3>Output:</h3><br><br>
	Output one line for each test case , the minimized maximum quarrel value.
	Quarrel value between 2 mice = Absolute Difference in Number of factors of their IDs.

<h3>Sample Input :</h3><br>
2<br>
5 8<br>
21 24<br>
<br>
<h3>Sample Output:</h3><br>
2<br>
4<br>
<br>
<h3>Explanation:</h3><br>
Case 1:<br>
ID  -  No. of factors<br>
5   -  2<br>
6   -  4<br>
7   -  2<br>
8   -  4<br>
5-6-7-8-5 is a good arrangement. 4-2 = 2.<br>
<br>
Case 2:<br>
ID  - No. of factors<br>
21	- 4<br>
22	- 4<br>
23	- 2<br>
24	- 8<br>
24-21-23-22-24 is a good arrangement. 8-4 = 4.<br>
