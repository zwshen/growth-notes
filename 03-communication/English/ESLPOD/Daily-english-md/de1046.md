[start of dialogue]

Driver: Ma’am, where would you like these suitcases ?

Leona: The three wheeled suitcases should go next t o the bed, and the garment bag should be hung up in the closet. Where is my ex pandable bag?

Driver: Do you mean this duffel bag?

Leona: Yes. You can leave that right there. Hmm, wh ere is my carry-on? All I see is my checked baggage. I thought I gave you my carr y-on, too.

Driver: You did, ma’am, and it’s right here.

Leona: Oh, good. When can I expect my trunk to arri ve?

Driver: Your trunk? You had a trunk?

Leona: Yes, I had a trunk. Didn’t you see it at the  airport?

Driver: Uh no, I must have overlooked it.

Leona: You mean you left behind my trunk?! Who know s what has become of it by now!

Driver: I’m sure I’ll be able to find it and delive r it here to you.

 Leona: I knew I should have used a luggage forwardi ng service.

Driver: You might consider traveling light next tim e, ma’am.

Leona: What did you say?!

Driver: Nothing! I’m going to fetch your trunk as w e speak.

Leona: I should hope so!

Our dialogue is between a woman named Leona and her  driver. A “driver” is a person who usually drives you around in a car. You could have a driver if you’re a rich person, for example. You don’t want to drive , so you have a driver – someone who drives you from place to place.

The driver says to Leona, “Ma’am,” which is a polit e way of addressing a woman – somewhat formal, however, “where would you like t hese suitcases?” A “suitcase” is the same as a piece of luggage. It’s a container in which you put your clothing and other things that you are using, and that is used to transport those items to wherever you’re going when you trave l.

Leona says, “The three wheeled suitcases should go next to the bed.” A “wheeled (wheeled) suitcase” is a suitcase that has  – are you ready? – wheels. Yes. A wheeled suitcase has wheels on it so that yo u can roll it along the ground. Back when I was growing up, most suitcases did not have wheels on them. Instead, you bought this separate little device cal led a “luggage carrier” and you put your pieces of luggage on that. Now luggage com panies have gotten smart, and they put the wheels right on the suitcases, rig ht on the pieces of luggage.

Leona says that the wheeled suitcases should go nex t to the bed. She continues, “The garment bag should be hung up in the closet.” A “garment” (garment) is a piece of clothing. So, a “garment bag” is a special  piece of luggage that is only used typically for transporting clothing. Usually a  garment bag is long. You are able to put a suit in it or a dress in it, and then  you fold it over so that it doesn’t get all wrinkled. “Wrinkled” (wrinkled) is when you  put your clothes in a certain way that causes them to not be flat, to have a bunc h of lines in them.

A garment bag is a large bag then that is used for transporting usually a suit or a dress – some sort of formal clothing, although it d oesn’t have to be. The verb “to

hang up” is used to describe the action where you a re putting something, say a piece of clothing, into a closet. You want a piece of clothing to hang down vertically. Usually you put it on something called a “hanger” (hanger). A hanger is a triangular piece of metal or plastic that has a l ittle round hook on the top.

You put the clothing on the hanger and then you put  that hook over a bar or a, what we would call, “rod” (rod) in your closet. Thi s keeps your clothes, once again, from getting wrinkled. A garment bag typical ly has hangers inside of it and/or it has a hook on the top that you can use to  hang it in a closet. That’s what Leona means when she tells the driver that the garm ent bag should be hung up in the closet. “Hung” is the past participle of “ha ng.”

Leona then asks, “Where is my expandable bag?” “Exp andable” (expandable) comes from the verb “to expand,” which means to mak e bigger, to make something larger. An “expandable bag,” then, would be a piece of luggage that you could make bigger if you had more things to put  in it. It will get bigger for you, if you will, usually because the material is soft a nd will expand or because there is some additional space in the piece of luggage th at you can use if you need more room.

The driver says, “Do you mean this duffel bag?” A “ duffel (duffel) bag” is an example of an expandable bag, typically. It is a so ft cloth bag, usually in the shape of a round tube. We often associate duffel ba gs with people transporting their clothing back and forth – say, to a gym to ex ercise – but it could also be used just to transport a large amount of clothing o r other items when you travel. Duffel bags have a zipper on the top that opens and  allows you to put things in and take things out of the bag.

Leona says, “Yes. You can leave that right here. Hm m, where is my carry-on?” A “carry-on” is a small suitcase that you can bring w ith you on the plane to either put in front of you in the seat in front of you – u nderneath it – or above you in what are called the “overhead bins” (bins). That’s a piece of carry-on luggage. Most airlines in the United States allow you to bri ng one piece of carry-on luggage when you get on the plane. Your big suitcas es have to be typically checked, which is another way of saying they’re put  in the plane, but below where the passengers are, in the bottom part of the  plane.

Leona in fact refers to the checked baggage in the very next sentence. She says, “All I see is my checked baggage.” Once again, your  “checked baggage” is baggage that you give to the airline, and the airli ne puts it underneath the plane and then gives it back to you (you hope) when you a rrive to wherever you’re

going. Leona is looking for her checked baggage. Sh e says, “I thought I gave you my carry-on too.” The driver says, “You did, ma’am,  and it’s right here.”

Leona says, “Oh, good. When can I expect my trunk t o arrive?” A “trunk” (trunk) here refers to a large box that has hard sides on i t and a top that is used for transporting a large amount of books, clothing, or other items for travel. Trunks, or “travel trunks,” aren’t very popular anymore. Yo u usually will see them in movies – old movies – about people who are travelin g either by ship or by plane. They’re not very easy or convenient to move around.

People have trunks in their homes, however, to stor e things, especially clothing that they’re not wearing currently. My mother used to keep all of the winter clothing in trunks in our attic, in the very top pa rt of our house, so that it wouldn’t take up space in the rooms. She would then, of cour se, take it down and bring the clothing to us when the weather got cold – whic h unfortunately in Minnesota was often.

The driver says, “Your trunk? You had a trunk?” He’ s surprised that Leona is asking about it. Leona says, “Yes, I had a trunk. D idn’t you see it at the airport?” The driver says, “Uh, no. I must have overlooked it .” “To overlook” (overlook) something here means to ignore or to miss something . You didn’t see it. You didn’t notice it.

Leona says, “You mean you left behind my trunk?” the phrasal verb “to leave behind” something or “to leave something behind” me ans not to take something with you when you take all of the other items. It’s  something usually that you’ve forgotten. “I left my wallet behind in the hotel ro om” – I forgot to bring it with me.

Leona is a little angry with her driver. She says, “Who knows what has become of it by now?” The expression “what will become of” so mething is used when you’re worried about something and you’re not sure what wi ll happen. You may worry about your son or daughter: “What will become of my  son if he doesn’t get a job? What will become of my daughter if she doesn’t stud y in school?” You’re worried about their future.

The driver says, “I’m sure I’ll be able to find it”  – that is, the trunk – “and deliver it or bring it here to you.” Leona says, “I knew I sho uld have used a luggage forwarding service.” “To forward” (forward) somethi ng means to send it to another person. We use that term in email, for exam ple. When we forward a message to someone, we are taking a message someone  sent to us and sending it to somebody else.

A “luggage forwarding service” would be a special s ervice that takes your luggage and transports it to the place where you’re  going. So, instead of you bringing your luggage to the airport and having to worry about it, you give it to someone else at your house. They take it to the air port and it’s transported to the place where you’re traveling. Most people don’t do this. It’s probably much more expensive, but you could do it.

The driver says to Leona, “You might consider trave ling light next time, ma’am.” The driver is being somewhat rude here. He’s tellin g Leona that she should travel light next time. “To travel light” means to bring f ewer items, to not bring as many suitcases. Leona says, “What did you say?” She’s ob viously upset with the driver, angry with the driver.

The driver says, “Nothing. I’m going to fetch your trunk as we speak.” The driver realizes his mistake and he doesn’t repeat what he said to Leona. Instead, he just says, “Nothing,” meaning I didn’t say anything , or what I said wasn’t meant for you, or I didn’t really mean what I said. The d river says, “I’m going to fetch (fetch) your trunk as we speak.” “To fetch” somethi ng means to get something and bring it back.

We often use that verb with a dog, when we throw a ball and the dog runs after the ball and brings it back to us. We sometimes wil l use that verb to describe that action. We’ll even yell at the dog, “Fetch!” meanin g “Run after the ball – get it, and bring it back.” More generally, however, it mea ns to go and get something and bring it back, typically to another person. “I will fetch your purse, dear.” I will go and get your purse for you and bring it back to you, my loveliness. That’s what I say to my wife every day.

The driver is going to fetch Leona’s trunk “as we s peak,” he says. The expression “as we speak” means right now, right away, immediat ely. Leona responds, “I should hope so.” That expression “I should hope so”  is one you say when you are annoyed, upset, or angry, and you are expressin g your desire that something happen, especially something done by someone else.

So, for example, if you’re at a restaurant and the waiter charges you too much for your meal – the waiter brings you your bill, your c heck, and you look at it and you say, “Oh, this is wrong.” The waiter says, “Oh, I’m  sorry, sir. I’ll change that right away.” You might respond, “I should hope so” if you ’re very upset or very angry.

However, I don’t recommend using this phrase normal ly because there is an idea of not just being angry, but being somehow superior  to the other person – that you are above the other person and that the other p erson has done something

 very wrong, something that has hurt you, even. So, it’s not an expression you would normally use in daily conversation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
