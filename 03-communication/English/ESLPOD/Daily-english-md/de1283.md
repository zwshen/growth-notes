[start of dialogue]

Gretchen: I thought you were going out with your gi rlfriend tonight. What are you doing here watching TV?

Hugh: She’s mad at me.

Gretchen: Why?

Hugh: I forgot her birthday. It was last Tuesday an d it completely slipped my mind. I forgot to put a reminder on my calendar. Sh e’s moping and giving me the silent treatment.

Gretchen: What are you going to do to make up for f orgetting her birthday?

Hugh: I’m just going wait it out and let it blow ov er. She’ll get over it.

Gretchen: Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?

Hugh: I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her someth ing really special then.

Gretchen: I don’t think it works that way. She’s no t going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be sore spot.

Hugh: It’s not like I did something really bad that  I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?

Gretchen: Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .

 Hugh: You’re not her. I apologized. Sooner or later , she’ll realize she’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apo logy.

Gretchen: Okay, if you say so.

Gretchen begins by saying to Hugh, “I thought you w ere going out with your girlfriend tonight.” “To go out with” someone means  to go somewhere such as a restaurant, a theater, or a park to have fun. “What  are you doing here watching television?” Gretchen asks. Hugh says, “She’s mad a t me,” meaning his girlfriend is mad at him. She’s feeling anger toward him. Usua lly this happens because you have done something wrong with your girlfriend. Tha t’s the way it works, guys.

Gretchen says, “Why?” Why is she mad at you? Hugh s ays, “I forgot her birthday.” “To forget” means you don’t remember, an d if you don’t remember your girlfriend’s birthday, well, she won’t be your girl friend very long. Hugh says, “It” – meaning his girlfriend’s birthday, I believe – “was  last Tuesday and it completely slipped my mind.” For something “to slip (slip) you r mind” means to forget something or for something to be forgotten by accid ent. Of course, no one forgets something on purpose. “To slip your mind” i s just another way of saying “I forgot.”

Hugh says, “I forgot to put a reminder on my calend ar.” A “reminder” (reminder) is something that helps you remember about somethin g or remember to do something. Nowadays, with our electronic calendars,  you can put a reminder on your calendar and when that day comes up, you will get some sort of message on your phone or on your computer.

Hugh says that his girlfriend is “moping” (moping).  “To mope” means to show that you are very sad or unhappy, or perhaps disappointe d with someone or with something. “To mope” means to go around with a sad face and perhaps not be very interested in doing anything. Young children, when they’re angry at their parents, sometimes like to mope. They walk around t he house like the world has ended.

Hugh says his girlfriend is moping and giving him “ the silent treatment.” Oh, the silent treatment. “The silent treatment” is when so meone doesn’t talk to you, when someone refuses to talk to you – someone who w ould normally talk to you like, say, your girlfriend.

Gretchen asks, “What are you going to do to make up  for forgetting her birthday?” “To make up for” something is a phrasal verb meaning to do something nice for another person because you feel sorry for something you did – to try to improve a situation that is bad by doing something nice for the other person, especially when you did something wrong to that person.

Hugh says, “I’m just going to wait it out and let i t blow over.” Hugh isn’t going to do anything, I guess, to make up for forgetting his  girlfriend’s birthday. Big mistake, Hugh. Hugh decides he’s going “to wait (wa it) it out (out).” “To wait it out” means to not do anything, hoping that the situ ation will get better. If you are at your house and it starts to rain and you want to  go somewhere but you think the rain will stop in a short amount of time, you w ill decide probably “to wait it out” – just to wait until the rain ends and then you wil l do what you wanted to do.

Hugh is going to wait it out with his girlfriend, h oping that she will no longer be angry with him in the future. That’s what he means by the expression “to let it blow (blow) over.” “To let something blow over” mea ns to wait until things become better or wait until a problem solves itself . I’m not sure. I’m guessing the expression, however, comes from the idea of a storm , with the big clouds in the sky eventually blowing over, meaning they will even tually leave and things will be better when it comes to the weather.

In any case, Hugh says that his girlfriend will “ge t over it.” “To get over it” means to no longer be bothered by something bad that has happened to you. Hugh is hoping his girlfriend will get over the fact that h e forgot her birthday. Now, you have to be careful with this expression in using it  with other people, especially using it as what we would call a “command form,” or  an “imperative.” It’s somewhat rude to say to someone, “Get over it.” Peo ple do say it, of course. What they mean is you should stop being sad or angr y and just not worry about that situation that is making you sad or angry.

Gretchen asks another question of Hugh. She says, “ Are you sure you don’t want to get her a belated birthday present?” “Belated” ( belated) means happening later than it should. If someone’s birthday was yesterday  and you don’t see that person until today, you might say, “Oh, a belated h appy birthday,” meaning it’s too late now. Your birthday has already passed, but  I’m still going to wish you a happy birthday. Anything that is “belated” is happe ning later than it should. So a “belated birthday present” or gift is giving someon e a gift after his birthday.

Hugh says, “I’ll double up next year. I’ll get her something really special then.” Hugh says he’s not going to buy his girlfriend a bi rthday present this year. Instead, he’s going to buy an even better birthday present next year. He’s going

“to double (double) up.” “To double up” means to do  twice as much as what you would normally do. Now, you see, that’s not the way  girlfriends work, Hugh. You can’t wait until next year. She’s not going to wait  for you, perhaps, if you do.

Gretchen says, “I don’t think it works that way,” a nd Gretchen, of course, is correct. She says, “She’s not going to forget that you forgot her birthday. That’s always going to be a sore spot.” Something that is “sore” (sore) is something that hurts or causes you pain. A “sore spot” could be an  area on your body that when you touch, it hurts, but here it’s used more genera lly or more metaphorically to mean something that hurts you emotionally or psycho logically. A “sore spot” would be a topic or an area or a subject that is up setting to you, that bothers you, that makes you upset.

Hugh says, “It’s not like I did something really bad that I have to atone for. I forgot. What’s the big deal?” “To atone” (atone) me ans to do something to show that you are sorry, to try “to make up for,” going back to our previous phrasal verb, a bad situation. You try to do something that  will make things better – maybe you give someone a small gift in order “to at one for” criticizing that person unfairly last week. Hugh doesn’t think he did anyth ing really bad that he has to atone for. “What’s the big deal?” he asks, meaning “Why is this so important?”

Gretchen says, “Okay, you know best, but if I were her . . .” The expression “You know best” (best) is used to show that you think the other person knows better than you about how to handle a situation. We often use it, however, in a way that shows that we don’t agree with the other person, an d that’s what Gretchen is doing here. She’s saying to Hugh, “You know best,” which you think would mean “You’re smarter than I am,” or “You know more than I do,” but in fact what she’s really saying is, “I disagree with you. I think you ’re wrong.”

She then says, “If I were her . . .” meaning “If I were your girlfriend, Hugh . . .” She doesn’t finish that sentence, but you know what  she means here is that she would be angry and probably not forgive Hugh. Hugh says, “You’re not her. I apologized,” Hugh says. “To apologize” (apologize) means to say that you are sorry for something you have done, something wrong that you have done.

Hugh continues, “Sooner or later, she’ll realize sh e’s blown this completely out of proportion and she owes me an apology.” The express ion “to blow (blow) something completely out of proportion (proportion) ” means to make something seem more important than it really is, especially a  problem – to make a problem seem as though it is more important than it really is. Hugh thinks that eventually his girlfriend will realize that she has blown this  completely out of proportion and that she should apologize to Hugh.

 Gretchen says, “Okay, if you say so.” “If you say s o” is another expression similar to “You know best,” that really means “You’re wrong . I disagree with you. I don’t think what you are saying is correct.” And here, th ose of us who have some experience in the world know that Gretchen is right  and Hugh is definitely wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
