<P CLASS="paragraph">
Little Joan has N blocks,all of them of different sizes. He is playing to build cities in the beach. A city is
just a collection of buildings.
</P>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
A single block over the sand can be considered as a building. Then he can construct higher buildings by
putting a block above any other block. At most one block can be put immediately above any other block.
However he can stack several blocks together to construct a building. However, it’s not allowed to put
bigger blocks on top of smaller ones, since the stack of blocks may fall. A block can be specified by a
natural number that represents its size.
</P>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
It doesn’t matter the order among buildings. That is:
<pre>
1 3
2 4
</pre>
is the same configuration as:
<pre>
3 1
4 2
</pre>
</P>


<P CLASS="paragraph">
Your problem is to compute the number of possible different cities using N blocks. We say that #(N) gives
the number of different cities of size N. If N=2, for instance, there are only two possible cities:
</P>

<pre>
City #1:
1 2
</pre>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
In this city both blocks of size 1 and 2 are put over the sand.
</P>

<pre>
City #2:
1
2
</pre>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
In this city block of size 1 is over block is size 2, and block
of size 2 is over the sand.
</P>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
So, #(2)=2.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="5"><B>Input</B></FONT><BR>
A sequence of non-negative integer numbers, each of one in different line. All of them but the last one are
natural numbers. The last one is 0 and means the end. Each natural number is less than 900.
</P>

<P CLASS="paragraph">
<FONT SIZE="5"><B>Output</B></FONT><BR>
For each natural number I in the input, you must write a line with the pair of numbers I, #(I).</P>
