This episode is about dealing with or handling the heat, when it gets very hot outside.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Jolene:  I’m sweating like a pig.  When is this hea t wave going to end? 

Eric:  I’ve no idea, but I’m not moving a muscle un til it does.  Hand me that pitcher of iced tea, would you? 

Jolene:  Get it yourself.  I’m not moving until it drops below 80 degrees.   

Eric:  It’s not the temperature.  It’s the humidity .  It’s not even the dog days of summer yet and it’s scorching outside. 

Jolene:  It’s scorching inside, too.  Why can’t tha t fan move any faster?  Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air condi tioner? 

Eric:  We couldn’t afford an apartment with an air conditioner.  We were lucky to get this place. 

Jolene:  I don’t feel so lucky right now.  My legs are stuck to this chair and I’ve sweated through my clothes.   

Eric:  We could buy a portable air conditioner.   

Jolene:  We can? 

Eric:  Yeah, but you’d have to get up.   

Jolene:  Ugh, let’s do it tomorrow.

This episode is entitled – has the title of – “Deal ing With the Heat.”  “To deal (deal) with (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to manage or to handle, to react to something in a certain way.  This is deali ng with the heat, when the temperature gets very high. 

Jolene – who is not high, but is apparently hot – s ays, “I’m sweating like a pig.” “To sweat” (sweat) means you have liquid leaving yo ur body, because your body is so hot so there is what feels like water on your  skin.  Many people sweat a lot when it gets hot.  I have a friend who sweats a lot , even like when it’s 75 degrees; I mean it’s kind of strange.  But anyway, “to sweat” means to have this water on your body – this liquid that comes out of your body when it gets very hot.  “Sweat” also has other meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Jolene says, “When is this heat w ave going to end?”  A “heat wave” (wave – two words) is a period of time, usual ly a couple of days, maybe a week, when the temperature seems very hot, when it’ s hotter than usual.  In the summertime we often have heat waves here in Los Ang eles, where it gets very hot for maybe a week or so.  Doesn’t happen all tha t often, but it does happen. 

Eric says, “I’ve no idea (I have no idea when this heat wave is going to end he means), but I’m not moving a muscle until it does.”   “To not move a muscle” means not to move, not to get up, not to move your body, because it’s so hot – that’s the idea.  Eric says, “Hand me (or give me) that pitcher of iced tea, would you?”  A “pitcher” is a large glass or plastic cont ainer that we use to put liquid in. “Pitcher” (pitcher) is something we would use for b eer or tea or some other sort of usually cold liquid.   

Eric says he wants some iced tea, some tea that has  ice in it.  Jolene, however, is not interested in helping Eric; she says, “Get i t yourself.  I’m not moving until it (the temperature) drops below 80 degrees.”  “To dro p” means to go lower. “Drop” has a couple of other meanings in English as  well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Here it means for the te mperature to go down; in this case, to go below 80 degrees.  A “degree” here mean s a unit of measurement of temperature.  In the United States, we use the Fahr enheit scale; in most other countries the Celsius scale is used. 

Eric says, “It’s not the temperature.  It’s the hum idity.”  He’s saying the reason it’s so uncomfortable outside or uncomfortable where the y are is because of the humidity, not because of the temperature.  “Humidit y” is how much moisture –  

how much liquid is in the air – how much water is i n the air.  “Temperature” refers to how hot or cold it is.  So, you could have a ver y high temperature but not very much humidity.  It could be very dry out; there’s n ot very much water in the air. Places like Phoenix, Arizona, or anywhere in a dese rt, has very high temperatures but also very dry weather, so it’s wha t we would call a “dry heat,” there’s not a lot humidity.  Some places have both heat and humidity, states like Florida for example, in the southeast part of the U nited States, and there when it gets hot it gets very uncomfortable because there’s  also a lot of water in the air. This is actually sort of an old expression: “It’s n ot the heat, it’s the humidity.”  Eric says, “It’s not the temperature.  It’s the humidity ,” but there’s a more common way of saying that.  “It’s not the heat, it’s the h umidity,” meaning the real problem is not that it’s hot out, but that there’s so much water in the air.   

Eric says, “It’s not even the dog days of summer ye t and it’s scorching outside.” “The dog days of summer” is an expression used to d escribe the hottest days of the year in the summertime.  Usually in the United States, that’s sometime in July or August.  The phrase is sort of associated with t he time where it’s so hot that you can’t really do anything else, so it might not be a very exciting time of year because it’s so hot.  The dog days of summer would be days where it’s so hot you can’t really have a lot of fun. 

Eric says, “it’s scorching outside.”  When we say s omething is “scorching” (scorching) we mean it’s extremely hot.  Jolene say s, “It’s scorching inside, too (meaning inside of the house).  Why can’t that fan move any faster?”  A “fan” (fan) here means a small machine that moves air aro und; it blows air in a little circle that is supposed to help make you cooler.  J olene says, “Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air conditioner? ”  An “air conditioner” is a machine that produces cold air during times when it ’s hot outside.  Jolene says, “Remind me.”  Literally, this means help me remembe r something, but in the way that she’s using it she’s really sort of complainin g.  She’s wondering why we did something that perhaps wasn’t very intelligent, was n’t a very good idea.  “Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air condi tioning.  The “remind me” means I think we made a mistake; she’s saying that we made a mistake. 

Eric answers her; he says, “We couldn’t afford an a partment with an air conditioner.”  “To afford” means to have enough mon ey.  Eric says that he and Jolene could not afford an apartment with an air co nditioner.  “We were lucky to get this place,” he says.  Jolene says, “I don’t fe el so lucky right now.  My legs are stuck to this chair and I’ve sweated through my  clothes.”  “To be stuck” (stuck) means to be attached to something else, oft en so that you can’t move it or not move it very easily.  Because Jolene is swea ting so much she’s stuck to her chair; she can’t move because the water is stic king to her skin and to the  

chair.  Jolene says that she’s sweated through her clothes.  “To sweat through” means that you’ve been sweating so much your clothe s are now wet.  Your shirt and your pants are wet because of your sweat.  “Wet  from sweat,” we might say.   

Eric says, “We could buy a portable air conditioner .”  Something that is “portable” (portable) is something you can move easily from on e place to another.  Eric says that they could buy a portable air conditioner .  Air conditioners usually are either in a window or they’re part of the building or the house where you live; they’re part of the way that the house or apartment  is built, you don’t have to buy a separate machine.  But it is possible to buy a se parate portable air conditioner you can just move from one room to another.   

Jolene says, “We can?”  Eric says, “Yeah, but we’d have to get up,” meaning we’d have to leave our seats and actually go somewh ere.  Jolene says, “Ugh, let’s do it tomorrow.”  She’s so tired, she’s so ho t, she doesn’t want to get up and get the portable air conditioner today. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Jolene:  I’m sweating like a pig.  When is this hea t wave going to end? 

Eric:  I’ve no idea, but I’m not moving a muscle un til it does.  Hand me that pitcher of iced tea, would you?
