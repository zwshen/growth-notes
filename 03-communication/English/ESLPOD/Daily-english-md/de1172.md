This episode is going to talk about getting a room,  a space, for having a meeting – a business event. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, we have to find meeting rooms a nd a banquet hall for the annual sales meeting and luncheon. Do you have any ideas?

Nicole: We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done i n past years, or we can try the convention center.

Roberto: The company has grown so much in the past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need. The convention cent er sounds like a better option.

Nicole: The advantage of the hotel is that it has i n-house catering and waitstaff for the luncheon.

Roberto: Yes, but we can bring in outside catering,  which would give us more food options. The large convention center rooms wil l also allow us to configure the space the way we want it.

Nicole: But the hotel meeting rooms have built-in A /V. I’m not sure that’s available at the convention center.

Roberto: All right, I think we should visit both ve nues and book after we’ve met with the event managers. Agreed?

Nicole: Agreed. And we’ll need to sample the cateri ng options, right?

Roberto: Of course. What are expense accounts for?

Roberto begins our dialogue by saying to Nicole, “A ll right, we have to find meeting rooms and a banquet hall for the annual sal es meeting and luncheon.” A “meeting room” is a large room – usually at a hotel  or perhaps at a place called a “convention center,” which we’ll talk about in a mi nute – in which you can have a meeting. Meeting rooms are often used by organizati ons and companies that don’t have their own space to have a room, or when you have too many people for your own offices.

A “banquet” (banquet) is a large meal for many peop le. A “banquet hall” (hall) is a large room in which you can have your meals. Now, w hat’s the difference between a “banquet hall” and a “meeting room?” Well , a meeting room isn’t really designed for eating in, whereas a banquet hall is. You could have a banquet hall at a large restaurant or a banquet room at a large restaurant. The word “hall” (hall) refers to a very large space, a very large r oom, one that might have five hundred people or a thousand people in it.

A “luncheon” (luncheon) is a formal lunch, usually for a large number of people. So, Roberto is looking for a place that has meeting  rooms, and perhaps also a banquet hall “for the annual” – that is, every year  – “sales meeting and luncheon.” “Do you have any ideas?” he asks Nicole.  Nicole says, “We could hold it at a hotel as we’ve done in past years.”

“To hold (hold) an event” means to have a large mee ting or a large event in a certain place. “We’re going to hold our wedding rec eption in a hotel.” We’re going to have it in a hotel. A “wedding reception” is a p arty that you have after the wedding. Many large hotels have meeting rooms and b anquet halls in which you can have your meetings and banquets. Nicole suggest s going to a hotel or trying a convention center.

The word “convention” (convention) here refers to a  large meeting about some topic in which everyone who goes to the meeting is interested in. A convention usually has many meetings about the same topic. A “ convention center” is a large building that is built just for conventions. Many large cities in the U.S. have convention centers. Los Angeles has a convention ce nter. These convention centers are often so large you could have several c onventions at the same time because they have so much room in them.

 Roberto says, “The company has grown so much in the  past year. I don’t think the hotel has the capacity we need.” “Capacity” (ca pacity) here refers to the number of people that you could put in a room or in  a building. If you have a very large convention or large meeting, you need rooms t hat have a very large capacity. Roberto suggests that a convention center  is a better option, a better idea.

Nicole says, however, that “the advantage of the ho tel is that it has in-house catering and waitstaff for the luncheon.” The expre ssion “in-house” refers to something that is done within the same business. So , for example, a large company might have an “in-house legal department.” They don’t go to lawyers who work for themselves or for another company. The y have their own lawyers.

Hotels often have “in-house catering” (catering). “ Catering” refers to preparing and serving food at a lunch or a dinner, say. “In-h ouse catering,” then, refers to the ability of a hotel to provide the food without having to go to a restaurant or to another business in order to provide that service. A hotel also often has its own “waitstaff” (waitstaff). “Waitstaff” refers to wait ers and waitresses – people who bring you the food or who take your orders at a res taurant.

Roberto says, “Yes, but we can bring in outside cat ering.” Nicole is talking about the advantages of a hotel having in-house catering and waitstaff. Roberto is talking about using a convention center. But when y ou use a convention center, usually you have to get another company outside of the convention center to bring the food in and serve it. That’s what he mean s by “outside catering” – outside the convention center, people who don’t wor k for the convention center, in effect.

Roberto says that if they do that, if they use outs ide catering, they will have “more food options,” more choices. “The large conve ntion center rooms will also allow us to configure the space the way we want it, ” Roberto says. “To configure” (configure) means to arrange something in a particu lar way or in a certain way so that it does what you want it to do. You could conf igure your phone so that it doesn’t ring after a certain time at night. You can  configure a room so that it will have enough chairs and tables for everyone in your meeting.

Roberto thinks that the convention centers will hav e large rooms that will allow the company to configure the space – the area, the room – the way it wants it. Nicole, however, says that “hotel meeting rooms hav e built-in A/V.” “A/V” refers to “audiovisual.” It refers to the kind of equipmen t that you would use to make a presentation to a large group of people. It might r efer to the sound system,

including microphones and speakers. It might refer to a screen on which you can put information or project images – all of that wou ld be included in A/V.

Convention centers often provide A/V services, but not all of the rooms may have the A/V. They may have to bring audiovisual equipme nt in, in order to do what you want to do. Hotel meeting rooms nowadays in man y cases have built-in A/V. “Built (built) – in (in)” refers to equipment that is permanently in the room. It’s there all the time. You don’t have to bring it in f rom another room. Nicole says, “I’m not sure that built-in A/V is available at the  convention center.”

Roberto then says, “All right,” (he likes to say “a ll right” – this is the second time he’s said it) “I think we should visit both venues and book after we’ve met with the event managers. Agreed?” A “venue” (venue) is a  place where a certain event happens. It’s just another term for a place, but usually it refers to a place for a specific event. So, a bar could be a venue for a small musical group to play music, or a large stadium could be a venue for a mu sical group to play its music.

Anything, really, can be a venue as long as an even t can take place there. “To book” (book) is the same as “to reserve.” It means to say, “Yes, we’re going to use this space,” or this venue. Usually, it require s signing a contract with the hotel or the convention center and then giving them  a certain percentage of the money in order for them to hold or to keep the spac e for you. That’s the meaning of the verb “to book.” It’s the same as “to reserve .” You can book a hotel room, for example, for your trip.

An “event manager” is a person at a hotel or conven tion center whose job it is to help you make the reservation and to take care of a ll of the planning details that are required for you to hold your event. Roberto is  suggesting that he and Nicole go and visit these venues, these places, talk to the event managers, and then book a space. Nicole says, “Agreed. And we’ll need to sample the catering options, right?” “To sample” (sample) means to try something before you buy it.

Many times when you go to a hotel, especially for a  wedding reception, the hotel will give you samples of the food that you can tast e so you can decide whether you like it or not. To be honest, this doesn’t happ en all that often with meeting rooms at a hotel or a convention center. I’ve booke d many conferences and meetings at hotels and convention centers and I’ve never sampled the food, but in the dialogue, Roberto and Nicole are going to be  able to do that.

Nicole says that she and Roberto will need to sampl e the catering options. They’ll need to try the food to make sure they like it. Rob erto says, “Of course. What are expense accounts for?” An “expense (expense) accoun t” is an amount of money

that a company gives an employee to do things that are necessary for the company, that are outside of the company offices, t ypically. So, if the company is sending you on a trip, you will get money from the company to pay for that trip. That’s part of your expense account.

I guess in this case Nicole and Roberto are going t o be traveling to the hotel or to the convention center, and the expense account will  pay for the travel to these places. The samples, however, are usually provided free by the catering departments of a hotel or a caterer that might serv ice a convention center, so I don’t think that’s what they’re referring to here. It must be the travel that they will have to undergo, or take, in order to get to these venues.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
