This episode is a dialogue about contagious disease s – diseases or illnesses that can spread from one person to another. Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Isabelle: You can’t walk through that door with all  of your clothes on!

Linus: What?! I’ve just come off of a 12-hour fligh t. I’m tired and I want to get into my own house and into my own bed.

Isabelle: I know, but you’ve just returned from McQ uillanland, and I’ve just read that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease called Niebola. It can be transmitted through casua l contact, so even if you don’t have it, you could spread it.

Linus: So what am I supposed to do? Stand out here for the rest of my life?

Isabelle: Of course not. Take off your clothes.

Linus: You want me to take off my clothes in front of the house? Are you crazy?!

Isabelle: No, the best way to prevent the spread of  this infectious disease is to burn clothing that has been in contact with it, and  to bathe you thoroughly.

Linus: I’m not stripping down to my underwear out h ere.

Isabelle: But aren’t you worried about transmitting  Niebola to me and everyone you know? No one is immune. You could start an epid emic!

Linus: All right, but I’m going around to the back door where no one can see me, okay?

Isabelle: Great! I’ll get your bath ready. I just h ave to heat the mayonnaise.

Linus: What?! You want me to take a bath in mayonna ise?

Isabelle: That’s the only way to kill Niebola.

Our dialogue begins with Isabel saying to Linus, “Y ou can’t walk through that door with all of your clothes on!” Linus says, “Wha t?! I've just come off of a 12- hour flight. I'm tired and I want to get into my ow n house and into my own bed.” So, we have a situation where Linus is coming off o f a plane. He says, “I've just come off of a 12-hour flight,” which means he was o n a plane for 12 hours. He got off the plane and went home, but Isabel, who we  guess to be his wife, is not letting him into the house.

Isabel says, “I know” – I understand you want to ge t into your house – “but you’ve just returned from McQuillanland, and I've just rea d that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease ca lled Niebola. It can be transmitted through casual contact, so even if you don't have it, you could spread it.” We learn that Linus has gone to what I think s ounds like a wonderful place, McQuillanland, and unfortunately has perhaps become  a carrier of a communicable disease.

A “carrier” (carrier) is a person who has a certain  disease, but doesn't show any symptoms. It doesn't look like the person has any d isease. However, because they have the disease, they could give it to other people. We’re talking here about diseases or illnesses that are communicable. The term “communicable” (communicable) refers to things that can be transmi tted or shared or given to other people from one person to another. A disease such as “chicken pox” can be “communicated,” or transmitted, from one person to another. That makes it a communicable disease.

This “communicable disease” is called Niebola. Isab el says, “It can be transmitted through casual contact, so even if you don't have it, you could spread it.” “Transmit” here means to share, to pass from o ne person to another. We use the verb “transmit” in this sense when we’re talkin g about things like communicable diseases. We also use it in biology to  talk about genetic traits or characteristics that are passed from parents to the ir children.

 The term “casual contact” refers to you talking to someone, and not perhaps touching someone, but only for a very short amount of time. However, there are certain diseases that, even with casual contact, ev en though you don't have a lot of contact with that person – you're not talking to  them or being with them for very long time – can still end up being a way of catchin g or getting a disease. Some diseases can be transmitted through casual contact.  Many cannot. Many require some more “extensive,” we might say, contact with a  person who has that disease.

Isabel says that even if Linus doesn't feel any of the effects of the disease, he could still spread it. “To spread (spread)” means t o distribute something, to move something around so that it covers a larger area or , in this case, affects more people. If you are spreading disease, you are in a way helping other people get this disease. You are doing something that is going  to increase the likelihood of other people getting the disease.

Linus says, “So what am I supposed to do? Stand out  here for the rest of my life?” He's confused about what he has to do in ord er to get into his own house. Isabel says, “Of course not. Take off your clothes”  – remove your clothing. Linus says, “You want me to take off my clothes in front of the house? Are you crazy?!” Isabel says, “No, the best way to prevent the sprea d of this infectious disease is to burn clothing that has been in contact with it, and to bathe you thoroughly.” So, this is something of an odd disease that apparently  can be transmitted through someone's clothing.

Isabel says the best way to prevent the spread of t his infectious disease is to burn clothing. “To prevent” means to not allow some thing to happen, to not permit something to happen. An “infectious (infecti ous) disease” is a disease that can be caused when some organism – some living orga nism such as bacteria or a virus or fungus – enters the body. Isabel says th at Niebola can be prevented, or at least we can prevent the spread of this infec tious disease, by burning clothing that has been in contact with it. “To burn ” means to put something in a fire, to destroy something by fire.

“To be in contact with” something is to have touche d something or to have touched someone. Isabel wants to burn Linus’s cloth ing in case it has been in contact with this disease. She also wants to bathe Linus. “To bathe” (bathe) means to wash someone, typically in a large contain er which we call a “tub” (tub). You put water in the tub and then you take the wate r and you use it to clean a person off – or to clean your dog off, I suppose.

Linus is not happy about this situation. He says, “ I'm not stripping down to my underwear out here.” “To strip (strip) down to” som ething here usually means to remove your clothing, to get undressed. Linus doesn 't want to strip down to his underwear, meaning to take off all of his clothes e xcept his underwear. “Underwear” just refers to clothing that you wear u nderneath other clothing – typically, that you don't want people to see. “Unde rwear” protects your clothing from touching directly to certain parts of your bod y. Let’s put it that way.

Isabel says, “But aren't you worried about transmit ting Niebola to me and everyone you know? No one is immune.” “To be immune ” (immune), when we’re talking about a disease, means that you cannot get a disease. Maybe the biological makeup or composition of your body is su ch that you can't get a disease. It might also be that you have received a vaccination – that you've taken a pill or received a shot that prevents you from ge tting the disease. Isabel says that “no one is immune” to Niebola.

She says to Linus, “You could start an epidemic!” A n “epidemic” (epidemic) is a situation in which a disease affects many people in  a particular area. It spreads. It is transmitted to many different people. Linus s ays, “All right, but I’m going around to the back door where no one can see me, ok ay?” Linus wants to go to the back of the house so that he doesn't have to un dress in front of the house.

Isabel is happy. She says, “Great. I'll get your ba th ready. I just have to heat the mayonnaise.” “Mayonnaise” is a white sauce – made f rom eggs, vinegar, lemon juice, and other things – that is often used on bre ad or in preparing food. It is not something we would usually associate with medicine.  Linus says, “What?! You want me to take a bath in mayonnaise?” Isabel says,  “That's the only way to kill Niebola.” So, Niebola is a very strange disease. Bu t McQuillanland is a very strange country.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
