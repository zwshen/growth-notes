<h1 align="center">Loading a Cargo Ship</h1>

<hr/>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Ahoy there, software sailors! Your ship is in need of repairs! Last night a
big wave swallowed the cargo routing computer (CRC) which is essential for
logistic operations. Fortunately there is a replacement computer in the lower
deck; however, there is no backup of the cargo routing software! Your mission
is to reprogram the CRC assuming the following ship characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ship has up to <code>9</code> cargo containers (of different sizes) 
  available for storing packages;</li>
  <li>The containers are numbered <code>1</code> to <code>9</code>;</li>
  <li>Each cargo container has a specific maximum weight capacity, up 
  to <code>999</code> tons;</li>
  <li>Each package weights at most <code>9</code> tons;</li>
  <li>The ship can only be loaded with no more than <code>999</code> packages 
  (for good luck, the crew says).</li>
</ul>

<p>The packages are loaded into the ship via a conveyor belt which is
connected to a cargo router (controlled by the CRC). The cargo router then
forwards each package to one of the available cargo containers, according to
the following algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, select only the cargo containers that carry the lowest
  number of packages;</li>
  <li>Then, reduce the selection by choosing only the containers that have the
  greatest available weight capacity;</li>
  <li>Further reduce the selection by picking the container with the lowest
  number;</li>
  <li>If the selected cargo container cannot carry the package then the ship's
  loading ends.</li>
</ol>

<p>To illustrate the cargo routing algorithm, consider a ship with 3 cargo
containers (numbered 1, 2, and 3), respectively with 5, 10, and 5 tons of maximum weight
capacity. Assume now there are 8 packages to be loaded, in sequence, into the
ship, weighting 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4
tons. In this scenario, the cargo routing algorithm should produce the
following activity:</p>

<pre>(first package) 4  3  2  1  1  2  3  4 (last package)
                |  |  |  |  |  |  |  x
                |  |  |  |  |  |  +------------------------+
                |  |  |  |  |  +-------------+             |
                |  |  |  |  +-----------+    |             |
  +-------------+  |  |  +---+          |    |             |
  |      +---------+  |      |          |    |             v
  |      |            |      v          v    v             
  v      v            v                                  : 3 :
                           : 1 :    : 1 1    2 1 1       2 1 1   (final contents
: 4 :    3 4 :    3 4 2    3 4 2    3 4 2    3 4 2       3 4 2    of the ship's
===== -> ===== -> ===== -> ===== -> ===== -> ===== ->    =====    cargo containers)
1 2 3    1 2 3    1 2 3    1 2 3    1 2 3    1 2 3       1 2 3</pre>

<p>(note: the colon symbol <code>:</code> is used to avoid presentation
errors; see also the sample output)</p>

<p>When the first package arrives (weighting 4 tons) all containers are empty, so rule 1 of the algorithm selects
containers 1, 2, and 3. In step 2, because container 2 has the greatest
available capacity (10 maximum tons - 0 used tons = 10 available tons), only
container 2 remains selected. Rule 3 again selects container 2. In rule 4 the package 
is loaded into container 2 because its available capacity (10 tons) is greater 
than the 4 tons of the package.</p>

<p>The second package ends up in container 1: in rule 1, containers 1 and 3
are selected because both have the lowest number of packages (zero, in this
case); rule 2 still selects the same containers since they have the same 5
tons of available weight capacity; rule 3 reduces the selection to just
container 1; finally, rule 4 loads the package, weighting 3 tons, into
container 1.</p>

<p>And so on, until all packages have been loaded into the ship, or, as in this 
scenario, until no cargo container can carry the current package, which 
prematurely ends the ship's loading (check the situation of the last package, 
weighting 4 tons).</p>

<p>Hurry! (and remember to backup the cargo routing software)</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>Input contains several test cases, separated by a blank line. Each test case describes the cargo containers and the packages to be loaded into
the ship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first line indicates the number <code>c</code> of cargo containers
  in the ship (<code>1 <= c <= 9</code>);</li>
  <li>The following <code>c</code> lines describe the maximum weight
  <code>cw<sub>i</sub></code> each container can carry (<code>1 <=
  cw<sub>i</sub> <= 999</code>);</li>
  <li>Then comes an empty line;</li>
  <li>The next line indicates the number <code>p</code> of packages to be
  loaded into the ship (<code>1 <= p <= 999</code>);</li>
  <li>The following <code>p</code> lines describe the weight
  <code>pw<sub>i</sub></code> of each package (<code>1 <= pw<sub>i</sub>
  <= 9</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is guaranteed that the weight of all packages is always lower or equal
to the ship's maximum weight capacity (<code>sum(pw<sub>i</sub>) <=
sum(cw<sub>i</sub>)</code>).</p>

<hr/>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h1>Output</h1>

<p>The output for each test case displays the final contents of the ship's cargo containers and 
presents a summary of total weights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first lines represent the final contents of the cargo containers;</li>
  <li>Then comes an empty line;</li>
  <li>The next line displays the weight of all packages loaded into the
  ship;</li>
  <li>The following line shows the total unused weight the ship would still be
  able to carry;</li>
  <li>The last line indicates the total weight of the packages that could not
  be loaded into the ship.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine carefully the sample output to prevent presentation errors. Print a blank line between datasets.</p>
