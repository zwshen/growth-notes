[start of dialogue]

Sam: I think our child should go to a public school . I did.

Yasmin: I went to a private prep school and I think  it gave me a leg up in life.

Sam: I got where I am without a fancy prep school.

Yasmin: And that’s great, but I think we should giv e our daughter every advantage we can.

Sam: What do you have in mind?

Yasmin: I have information here from a few of the m ost selective schools. Some are parochial and some are secular. Some are day sc hools and some are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not sending my daughter to a boarding scho ol and that’s final.

Yasmin: But some of the most exclusive schools are boarding schools.

Sam: I’m not budging on that. I want her coming hom e every day.

Yasmin: All right. Let’s look at the admission crit eria for the remaining schools. Wow, admission is really competitive. These have ve ry low admission rates.

Sam: Really?

Yasmin: Really. They also require two aptitude test s in addition to transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.

Sam: Do we really want to put our daughter through that? And look at the tuition!

Yasmin: Is that for all four years?

Sam: No, for one year.

Yasmin: You’re kidding.

Sam: I’m not. Public school is sounding better and better, isn’t it?

Sam begins our dialogue by saying, “I think our chi ld should go to a public school. I did.” In the United States, a “public (pu blic) school” is a school run by and paid for by the government. When I say the “gov ernment,” I’m referring to the local government usually, but public schools in all  cases are schools that are run by the government. That’s in American English. In B ritish English, a “public school” is what we would call a “private school.”

A “private (private) school” is a school that is no t run by the government. It might be run by a church or another organization. It migh t be run by a business. “Private schools” are any schools that are not run by the government. In British English, a “private school” is called a “public sch ool,” and a “public school” is called a “government school.” It’s a little confusi ng. In U.S. English, however, “public school” refers to a school run by the gover nment. “Private school” refers to a school run by some organization or group or bu sinesses other than the government.

Sam says that he wants his child to go to a public school. Yasmin says, however, “I went to a private prep school and I think it gav e me a leg up in life.” A “prep (prep) school” is also known as a “preparatory scho ol.” It’s supposed to be a school that is more difficult, that prepares you be tter to go to college. Yasmin says she went to a “private prep school” and that s chool “gave her a leg (leg) up in life.” “To be given a leg up in life” means to h ave an advantage over other people, to have something that allows you to be mor e successful in life – and certainly, a good education can help you “get a leg  up in life,” though not always. Look at me.

Sam says, “I got where I am without a fancy prep sc hool.” Notice Sam uses the adjective “fancy” (fancy) here. “Fancy” refers to s omething that is expensive or something that is for people with a lot of money. W e use that adjective “fancy” in other circumstances to mean slightly different thin gs, but here I think Sam is using it almost as an insult to say that he doesn’t  need, nor does his daughter need, a “fancy prep school.”

Yasmin says, “And that’s great,” meaning it’s great  Sam was able to do well without going to a prep school. She says, however, that she thinks “we should give our daughter every advantage we can.” Sam says , “What do you have in mind?” Yasmin responds, “I have information here fr om a few of the most selective schools.”

A “selective (selective) school” is a school that i s what we would describe as very “competitive,” meaning lots of people want to get i nto the school, and it is difficult to get “admitted to” or be allowed to attend that s chool. “Selective schools” usually only take a small percentage of the student s who want to get into the school. If a school is very good – like, say, Harva rd or Yale here in the United States, when referring to universities – those scho ols would be described as “selective” because many students want to go there but only a few are able to actually attend.

Yasmin says, “Some,” meaning some of the schools, “ are parochial and some are secular.” A “parochial (parochial) school” is a  school for children that is owned and run by or operated by a church, typically . The word “parochial” comes from the word “parish,” which usually refers to a l ocal church, a church in a certain area – a Christian church, typically, and m ost commonly a Catholic church. A “secular (secular) school” is a school th at is not related to any religion or church. It is what we might describe as “non-rel igious” – not religious.

Yasmin says, “Some are day schools and some are boa rding schools.” A “day (day) school” is a school that you send your child to during the day and then your child comes back to your house and lives with you, typically. A “day school,” that is, doesn’t provide a place for students to sleep a nd eat. If it did, we would call that a “boarding (boarding) school.”

Boarding schools are places that have rooms where s tudents live during the school year, and you, of course, send your child to  a boarding school and you don’t see your child until the end of that particul ar term or semester. Boarding schools are not very popular in the United States, though there are still boarding schools here in the U.S. They are more popular, at least among very rich families, in places such as England. In the U.S., t here is a tradition of boarding

schools especially on the eastern coast of the U.S.  They’re not as common here in California, but they do still exist.

Sam says, “I’m not sending my daughter to a boardin g school and that’s final,” meaning he’s not going to change his mind. Yasmin r esponds, “But some of the most exclusive schools are boarding schools.” “Excl usive” (exclusive) means available only to a small number of people, and ver y desirable. “Exclusive” refers to a group, a club, or a school that only a small n umber of people can be a part of. Sam says, “I’m not budging on that.” “To budge”  (budge) means to change your opinion or your position about something. Sam is “not budging” on his opinion, meaning he’s not going to change his opini on about sending his daughter to a boarding school. He is not going to d o that.

He says, “I want her coming home every day,” meanin g coming back to their house. Yasmin says, “All right. Let’s look at the a dmission criteria for the remaining schools.” “Admission (admission) criteria  (criteria)” are the requirements that a student must meet or must have in order to get into or be admitted to a school. If you want to go to Harvard or Berkeley here in the U.S., you must meet their “admission criteria,” which usu ally includes having very good grades, having good test scores, and so forth.

Yasmin and Sam are looking at the admission criteri a for these schools for their daughter. Yasmin says, “Wow, admission is really co mpetitive.” “Competitive” (competitive) means many people are trying to get s omething or do something. A “competitive school” is a school to which many stud ents are applying – many students want to go to that school. A school that i s competitive is usually a school that is also “selective,” meaning the school only t akes a certain number of students.

Yasmin notes that the schools she and Sam are looki ng at have “very low admission rates” (rates). The “admission rate” of a  school is the percentage of students that it accepts of the students who apply.  So, if a school has a 10 percent admission rate, that means that for every 1 00 students that want to go to that school, the school only accepts 10.

Sam says, “Really?” Yasmin says, “Really,” referrin g to the low admission rates. She says, “They also require two aptitude tests in addition to transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.” The requireme nts, then, for the schools that Sam and Yasmin are interested in are two aptit ude tests, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an interview.

An “aptitude (aptitude) test” is a test that is sup posed to test or give an indication of your ability to do something. We used to disting uish between “aptitude tests” and “achievement tests.” An “achievement test” is a  test that looks at how much you know based on what you studied or what you have  read. An “aptitude test” is supposed to somehow indicate your ability to do som ething even if you haven’t studied it yet.

A lot of psychologists now question whether aptitud e tests are really able to test someone’s ability to do something in the future wit hout actually having tried it, but that’s what “aptitude” is. It’s your ability to do something. Aptitude is something that, at least according to some scientists, you are born with and therefore you cannot change. In any case, these schools “require two aptitude tests, in addition to transcripts” (transcripts).

A “transcript” is an official piece of paper or doc ument that lists, or puts down, all of the classes that you have taken as a student and  the grade that you received, or the mark that you received. “Letters of recommen dation” are letters written by people who know you as a student – or in this case,  your daughter – and can speak to or give information about how good a stude nt she is. An “interview” (interview) is, of course, when someone sits down a nd asks you questions about things.

Sam says, “Do we really want to put our daughter th rough that?” “To put someone through” something means to make someone do  something difficult or something that might require effort or even pain. S am then says, “Look at the tuition!” The “tuition” (tuition) of a school is ho w much it costs to go there, what the price is. Yasmin says, “Is that for all four ye ars?” meaning the tuition that they are looking at. Sam says, “No, for one year.”

Many private schools in the U.S. can be very expens ive. I mean, in some schools here in Los Angeles, it can cost $15,000 a year to send your child to a selective school, often more than it costs to send someone to  a year of college. Yasmin and Sam are obviously very surprised at the cost, t he tuition of the schools they have been looking at for their daughter. Yasmin say s, “Is that for all four years?” And Sam says, “No, for one year.”

Yasmin then says, “You’re kidding,” meaning you’re joking. Sam says, “I’m not. Public school is sounding better and better, isn’t it?” He means maybe because these other schools are so expensive, it would be b etter to send their child – and certainly cheaper to send their child – to a public  school. Public schools are supposed to be free in the United States. The gover nment doesn’t charge you or make you pay money to send your child to a public s chool.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
