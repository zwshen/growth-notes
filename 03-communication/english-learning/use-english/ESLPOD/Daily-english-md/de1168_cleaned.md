This episode is a dialogue between Barbara and Sean  about reading a contract – a legal document, a legal agreement – very carefull y. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Barbara: Just sign on the dotted line and be done w ith it.  

Sean: Didn’t your parents ever teach you to read ev ery document carefully before you sign it? 

Barbara: Not when the contract is boilerplate. All of the terms are standard. 

Sean: No, they’re not. Did you notice in the fine p rint that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for additional charges ? 

Barbara: Really? No, I guess I missed that.  

Sean: If you had gone through this document with a fine-tooth comb as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for  the other side to end the contract at any time. 

Barbara: I guess I overlooked those. 

Sean: And there are contingencies for problems on t heir end, but not on ours.  

Barbara: Wow, I didn’t realize they were trying to screw us. Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.  

 Sean: Relax. This is par for the course with this k ind of contract. They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to f ind them. We just have to be vigilant, that’s all. 

Barbara: Do you think this is going to take much lo nger? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.  

Sean: It’ll take as long as it takes. What do you t hink that cot is for? 

[end of dialogue] 

Barbara says to Sean, “Just sign on the dotted line  and be done with it.” Barbara is telling Sean to sign his name – to put his signa ture on some sort of contract, some sort of an agreement. A “contract” (contract) is an agreement between two or more people or two or more groups. It usually is  used to refer to something that is, what we would say, “legally binding” (bind ing), meaning that you are required by law to do what you say you’re going to do in the contract, and if you don’t, you could be punished.  

Barbra is telling Sean to “sign on the dotted (dott ed) line.” It used to be, in many written contracts, that there was a line on which y ou put your signature. Now, there’s still a line on most contracts, but it was more common I guess, in the old days, to make it a “dotted line,” meaning it wasn’t  an uninterrupted line that you would draw with a pencil – rather, it was basically  a series of short lines or small points which we would call “dots.” And these little  dots were on the paper in the form of a line, and you would put your name on that  line. “To sign on the dotted line,” then, means to sign the contract.  

Sean says, “Didn’t your parents ever teach you to r ead every document carefully before you sign it?” Sean is surprised that Barbara  wants him to sign this contract without reading it carefully. Barbara says, “Not wh en the contract is boilerplate.” “Boilerplate” (boilerplate) – one word – is languag e that is used in some document that is very common, that is used in many different documents of this sort.  

Nowadays we would say you basically “copy and paste ” the text – that is, it is text that is used in all the contracts or in all the doc uments of this sort, and therefore the idea is that you don’t really have to read it e very time. Once you read it, you don’t need to read it again because it’s going to b e the same in the next contract or the next document. 

Barbara continues, “All of the terms are standard.”  The “terms” (terms) of a contract are the things that the contract says you have to do or the other person has to do. They are requirements of the agreement. “To be standard” means that they are usual – there’s nothing different about th em that you wouldn’t normally expect in a contract of this type. Of course, we’re  not exactly sure yet what the contract is. Sean says, “No, they’re not,” meaning the terms are not standard. They’re not the usual ones you would expect.  

He then asks, “Did you notice” – did you see – “in the fine print that if the agreement is cancelled, we’re on the hook for addit ional charges?” The “fine (fine) print (print)” of a document or an agreement  is the specifics of an agreement that often, in certain legal contracts, a ctually appear in a smaller font size – in a smaller size. The word “fine” here refe rs to the size of the letters, the “print,” in the contract.  

In some contracts, there are some words that are wr itten larger than others. The words that are written in the smaller print, or the  fine print, often contain very important details about the contract that many peop le don’t read. The “fine print” can also refer in general to the specifics or the d etails of any agreement, even if they are not actually written in smaller font sizes . Sean says that if the agreement is “canceled” – that is, if it is ended before it i s supposed to end – “we’re on the hook for additional charges.”  

The expression “to be on the hook” (hook) means you  are responsible, usually financially responsible, for something. If there is  something in the agreement that says that if you cancel the agreement, you have to pay a “fine” – that is you have to pay the other person some money – that’s an exam ple of being on the hook for something. It’s usually some term in the agreem ent that requires you to pay something if certain things happen, such as the agr eement being “cancelled.”  

Barbara is surprised. She says, “Really? I guess I missed that,” meaning I didn’t see that. Sean continues, “If you had gone through this document” – that is, if you had read this document – “with a fine-tooth com b as I have, you would have noticed that there are loopholes for the other side  to end the contract at any time.” The expression “to go through something with  a fine (fine) – tooth (tooth) comb” means to look at something very carefully, to  make sure you don’t miss anything. Notice once again the use of the word “fi ne” here to mean “small.”  

A “comb” is something you would normally use on you r hair to keep it straight. A man would use a comb to make sure that his hair is flat against his head. I don’t use a comb anymore since I don’t have any hair. If I did, however, I might use a “fine-tooth comb.” The “teeth” of a comb, like the teeth in your mouth, are things  

that extend down from the top. A comb has a number of different little pieces of plastic – or whatever the comb is made of – that ar e used in order to make the comb work to go through your hair.  

So, a “fine-tooth comb” would be a comb that has ma ny small, close together, usually, “teeth” that are used to put the hair back  into place. Anyway, here the expression just means to look at something very car efully. A “loophole” (loophole) is something in a law or in an agreement  such as a contract that is not very clear and that could be used to benefit one si de or the other.  

In this case, Sean is saying that there are “loopho les” in the contract so that the other party or the other group of people who are si gning the contract can end it at any time. The word “party” (party), when we’re talk ing about a contract, can refer to a single person or to a group of people.  

Barbara again says, “I guess I overlooked those.” “ To overlook” (overlook) here means not to understand the importance of something  or simply not to have seen something because you didn’t look carefully. Sean t hen says, “And there are contingencies for problems on their end, but not on  ours.” A “contingency” (contingency) in a contract is something that says what will happen in the future under certain conditions.  

So, for example, a contract might have a “contingen cy” that says that if you are unable to pay the money that you owe in this contra ct, you may have to pay an additional fine, an additional amount of money, to the other party in the contract. There are “contingencies” in this contract that Sea n and Barbara are talking about that will help the other side, the other part y in the contract. That’s what Sean means by “problems on their end, but not on ou rs.”  

Barbara says, “Wow, I didn’t realize they,” meaning  the other people in the contract, “were trying to screw (screw) us.” “To sc rew” someone is a vulgar term that I wouldn’t normally recommend you use, but it means to be very unfair to someone, to try to “cheat” (cheat) another person, to do something that wouldn’t be very nice. A better way of saying this, a more p olite way, would be “to take advantage of us,” or “to try” perhaps even “to chea t us.”  

Barbara says, “Maybe we shouldn’t do business with them.” Sean says, however, “Relax,” meaning don’t worry. “This is par for the course with this kind of contract.” For something “to be par (par) for the c ourse (course)” means for something to be normal, something to be common or s tandard, something to be expected. It’s actually a term from the game of gol f.  

“Par” is the normal score, the standard score, that  you would expect on a given hole in golf. Golf is normally a game that is divid ed up into basically 18 parts. Each part of the game requires you to hit a ball in to a hole. What is “par for the course” is what is the normal score that people wou ld get for this particular golf course. Every golf course is a little different. So me are easier, some are harder.  

Anyway, back to the story. We use the term “par for  the course” simply to mean standard, normal, usual. Sean continues, “They try to sneak in all kinds of things, and it’s our job to find them. We just have to be v igilant, that’s all.” “To sneak (sneak) in” something means to try to get something  in a, in this case, contract without the other person noticing – to try to do it  in secret.  

Sean says that he and Barbara have to be “vigilant”  (vigilant). “To be vigilant” means to be very careful about something, to be awa re of what is happening, to be looking out for problems or even danger. It mean s in a sense to stay awake, to be aware of what is going on – in this case, to be very careful in looking at the contract.  

Barbara says, “Do you think this is going to take m uch longer? They’re waiting in the other room to finalize the agreement.” So now w e understand that Barbara and Sean are in the same building as the other pers on or people who are part of this contract, and that they are waiting in the oth er room “to finalize” (finalize) the agreement. “To finalize” means to finish or complet e something.  

Sean says, however, “It’ll take as long as it takes .” That expression, “It will take as long as it takes,” means that you, in a way, don ’t have any control over the time, or I’m going to take as long as I need to do this right. It’s that second meaning that Sean I think is trying to convey here.  He’s saying he’s going to take his time. He’s going to look at this closely even i f it takes a long time. “It’ll take as long as it takes.”  

Sean says, “What do you think that cot is for?” A “ cot” (cot) is a portable folding bed. It’s what you might use, for example, if you g o camping. It’s what might be used, for example, in the military, when you have l ots of different people in a single place and you don’t have beds for everyone. You may have these portable beds called “cots.”  

I once slept on a cot for about six months when I d idn’t have a place to stay when I was a younger man, in my twenties. That’s a long story – I’ll tell you that some other time. Sean is sort of making a joke, or maybe  not. He’s saying that they’re going to be there so long they may have to sleep in  that room, and that’s what  

 the cot is for, because it’s going to take a long t ime for Sean to finish looking at this contract.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
