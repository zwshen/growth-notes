Let's get started.   [start of dialogue]  Carole: It is beyond me how you and Oscar can be roommates. You’re very tidy and he’s, well, a slob.   Felix: It’s not always easy, but we’re making it work.   Carole: Isn’t Oscar really messy all the time? Whenever I see him, his clothes are rumpled and his hair is unkempt.  Felix: His room is really cluttered, but he keeps the common areas in passable condition. I do have to straighten up fairly often, and I sometimes have to pick up after him, but that’s because I’m pretty nitpicky.  Carole: That’s very tolerant of you.  Felix: Well, we have set up a system so that if things get too messy, I have some recourse.  Carole: Really, what’s your system?  Felix: Oscar and I agreed that every time he leaves a big mess, I can fine him.  Carole: That seems kind of drastic, but maybe it works for you guys.  Felix: Yeah, it keeps the place pretty clean.
