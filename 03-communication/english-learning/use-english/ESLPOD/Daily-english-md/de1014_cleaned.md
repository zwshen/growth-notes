This episode is a dialogue between Vaughn and Sydne y about becoming a spy. What are they going to talk about? Well, I could te ll you, but then I’d have to kill you. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Vaughn: You’ve been reading that novel for hours. W hat is it? 

Sydney: It’s a spy novel and it’s really good. It’s  about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing cod e breaking, but he becomes embroiled in the world of espionage.  

Vaughn: That sounds exciting. 

Sydney: Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization and to feed them misinformation. I’d love to be a spy. 

Vaughn: You wouldn’t really want to live the life o f a spy, would you? You’d have to live a double life, not being able to tell your friends and family that you’re an operative. 

Sydney: I wouldn’t care if I could go on clandestin e missions to thwart and sabotage the enemy. Working for the C.I.A. would be  a dream come true. 

Vaughn: You’d have to keep a lot of secrets, not di vulging classified information.  

Sydney: Yes, so? 

Vaughn: Loose lips sink ships. 

Sydney: What are you trying to say?  

Vaughn: Well, no offense, but I think your cover wo uld be blown after about five minutes!

This episode is about becoming a spy. A “spy” (spy)  is a person who works for the government of his or her country and tries to g et information about other countries. Sometimes spies actually do things to hu rt other countries. That’s part of their job. Here, we’re talking about becoming a spy. We begin with Vaughn, who says to Sydney, “You’ve been reading that novel  for hours. What is it?”  

Sydney says, “It’s a spy novel and it’s really good .” A “spy novel” would be, of course, a fictional book about international spies.  These sorts of novels were very popular when I was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, especially during the time of what we called the “Cold War,” when there w ere diplomatic and other tensions between the Soviet Union and the United St ates. There are lots of good spy novelists out there. My favorite is John Le Car ré, the British author. But getting back to our story . . .  

Sydney says, “This spy novel is about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing code breaking.” “ To recruit” (recruit) means to get someone to join an organization. We often use t his verb when talking about the military. The United States has a voluntary mil itary force, meaning you’re not forced to become a member of the military as you ar e in some countries. In the U.S., therefore, the military has to recruit people . It has to go out to high schools and colleges and try to get young men and women to sign up to become part of the military.  

This novel is about a man who is recruited not by t he military, but by the C.I.A. – the Central Intelligence Agency. The C.I.A. is the part of the U.S. government that is responsible basically for spies – for gathe ring information (secret information, often) about countries and about doing  other things that the president wants the agency to do in other countries . Sometimes these are things the other countries don’t like. In fact, most of th e time they’re probably things the other countries don’t like.  

“Counterintelligence” (counterintelligence) is a lo ng word that refers to the efforts and activities that other governments go through to  try to prevent someone from getting their information. So, you have the United States, for example, trying to get secret information about, say, another country – let’s just say Canada. You  

know, Canada is a pretty . . . pretty violent count ry. We have to be very careful about the Canadians, I think.  

I’m kidding, of course. The Canadians are wonderful  people. But let’s imagine that the Americans are spying on the Canadians. The  Canadians don’t want the Americans to find out what they’re doing, so they d o things to hide their secrets. After all, if they didn’t hide that information, it  wouldn’t be secret. These efforts to hide information so that other governments don’t di scover it is called “counterintelligence.”  

In the novel, the person – the man – is recruited t o work in counterintelligence doing code breaking. “Code breaking” is also called  by a more technical name, “cryptography.” Basically, it is the art – some wou ld say the science – of analyzing codes and trying to understand the hidden  information in the codes. “Cryptography,” or “code breaking,” was extremely i mportant during World War II, for example, where each country tried to break the secret code of the other country. The “code” (code) here means the system th at is being used to disguise, or to hide, information.  

The man in Sydney’s novel has become “embroiled in the world of espionage.” “To be embroiled” (embroiled) means to be completel y involved in something, especially something that is difficult – a difficul t situation. You can also become embroiled in an argument, where two people are figh ting with each other verbally or perhaps even physically. “Espionage” (espionage)  refers to the practice of spying.  

Vaughn says, “That sounds exciting.” Sydney says, “ Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization an d to feed them misinformation. A “mission” (mission) here means an important assignm ent, especially one that involves traveling somewhere for a specific purpose . We often use that word “mission” to talk about the tasks or assignments th at a spy gets and has to carry out, or accomplish.  

“To infiltrate” (infiltrate) is to become a member of an organization in order to get information about that organization. So, for exampl e, if there are a group of terrorists – people who are trying to blow up a bui lding, let’s say – the government may try to put someone in that group, ge t someone to become a member of that group, in order to get information a bout the group and what it is planning on doing. That would be “to infiltrate.”  

What the person in the novel that Sydney is reading  is doing is infiltrating another spy organization. So, the C.I.A. might be infiltrat ing the spy organization of  

Canada, whatever that’s called. While we often thin k of infiltrating an organization as a way of getting information from the organizati on, in the novel that Sydney is reading, the spy’s job is not to get information fr om the other organization, but to feed them, or give them, misinformation.  

“Misinformation” is information that is given to an other group in order to trick them, in order to lie to them, in order to make the m think something is true when it really isn’t true. You can talk about misinforma tion in a lot of different contexts. In a business organization you might, for example, have misinformation that you give to people who are trying to do the same things  that your company does, and you don’t want them to find out what you’re doing. Basically it’s lying, and so it’s not a recommended practice. However, I’m sure it’s done.  

When we talk about governments and misinformation, we’re talking about information that is meant to make another governmen t think something is true when in fact it is not. Now, there’s a related word  called “disinformation” (disinformation). “Disinformation” is when the gove rnment gives false information, often to reporters and newspapers to make them thin k something is true about their country that really isn’t. Disinformation is sort of a special kind of misinformation. 

Sydney says, “I’d love to be a spy.” Vaughn says, “ You wouldn’t really want to live the life of a spy, would you?” Notice, this is  a classic example of a tag question in English. The first part is negative, an d the question tag, or part at the end, is affirmative, or positive. “You would not re ally want to live the life of a spy, would you?” Vaughn’s assumption is that Sydney does n’t really want to be a spy.  

Vaughn says, “You’d have to live a double life, not  being able to tell your friends and family that you’re an operative.” “To live a do uble life” is to have a secret or hidden identity separate from your normal life. So,  you might work at a bank during the day, but also you work as a spy on night s and weekends. You don’t tell the people at the bank that you’re a spy. You’ re living a double life – a secret life in addition to your normal or regular life.  

An “operative” (operative) is someone who works in the spy business, we might say – who works in espionage. Sydney says, “I would n’t care if I could go on clandestine missions to thwart and sabotage the ene my.” “Clandestine” (clandestine), which can also be pronounced “clande stine,” refers to something that is secret, something that is hidden, especiall y if it is related to something that is wrong or criminal. Here, the meaning is basicall y a hidden mission or a secret mission.  

Sydney wants to go on “missions to thwart and sabot age the enemy.” “To thwart” (thwart) means to interfere with something so that someone cannot do what he or she was planning to do. “To sabotage” is similar. “ To sabotage” (sabotage) usually means to interfere with someone, but in a p hysical way. You might, for example, blow up a bridge or do something to the en emy’s water supply. Those are examples of sabotage.  

Sydney says, “Working for the C.I.A. would be a dre am come true.” We use that expression, “a dream come true,” to refer to the pe rfect situation, an ideal situation for you. Vaughn says, “You’d have to keep  a lot of secrets, not divulging classified information.” “To divulge” (divulge) mea ns to tell someone something that is secret – to give information to someone tha t you are not supposed to, often. “Classified” refers to information that the government says is secret. The government says this is classified information; you  can’t tell anyone else about it.  

Sydney says, “Yes, so?” Vaughn then uses an old exp ression: “Loose lips sink ships.” “Loose lips” refers to people who are alway s talking, who are talking to people and giving them information they shouldn’t b e giving them. “To sink” a ship means to make a boat or ship go down into the water. So, “loose lips sink ships” means that people who give information and a re not careful about secret information that they have may hurt the cause of th e country – may actually cause the enemy to get information that would lead to the destruction of some part of your country’s military.  

Sydney says, “What are you trying to say?” Vaughn s ays, “Well, no offense” – meaning don’t get angry, I’m not trying to upset yo u – “but I think your cover would be blown after about five minutes.” The “cove r” of a spy is the false identity that the spy has so that no one knows that he or sh e is a spy. Your cover might be that you are a photographer, traveling and takin g photographs of things, when in fact you’re a spy for your government. Your cove r is that you’re a photographer.  

“To blow someone’s cover” is to reveal who they rea lly are – to say, “This person isn’t really a photographer, he’s a spy.” When that  happens, your cover is blown. “Blown” (blown) is the past participle of the verb “to blow.” I, for example, would make a very, very bad spy. I would definitely not b e able to keep my mouth shut – to not talk. The C.I.A. definitely would not want  me to work for them. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
