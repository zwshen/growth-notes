[start of dialogue]

Tom: I wonder how much longer we’ll have to put up with Dennis. He is the most incompetent boss I’ve ever worked for.

Katie: He’s not that bad, is he? I don’t have much contact with him.

Tom: Are you kidding? He’s always sleeping on the j ob. The other day, he was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors visiting  from Salt Lake City. Instead, I heard that he went to a baseball game and the sup ervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office.

Katie: It’s hard to believe that he’d fall down on the job like that.

Tom: It’s not only that. He’s always passing the bu ck. Every time something goes wrong at the factory, he blames everyone but himsel f.

Katie: If he’s as bad as you say he is, he must be on his way out. But, you know what they say, “Better the devil you know, than the  devil you don’t.”

Tom: Yeah, I know, but I’m willing to take my chanc es.

The title of today’s podcast is “A Bad Boss.” Your boss, of course, is the person who you work for. It’s a dialogue between Tom and K atie. Tom says, “I wonder how much longer we have to put up with Dennis?” How  much longer means how much more time. “I wonder how much longer this tele vision show will last. I wonder how much longer I will have to wait for my d octor. I wonder how much more time.” To “put up with” means to tolerate. Whe n we say, for example, “I have to put up with the noise” - means I have to li ve with it, even though it is

bothering me. And to “put up with” is always referr ing to something negative that is happening, that you have to live with. You can’t  do anything about it, you have to tolerate it. I have to put up with screaming chi ldren out in the street. I have to put up with dogs that are barking next door to me -  both of those things are true, by the way.

Well, in the dialogue Tom says, “I have to put up w ith Dennis” or Tom says, “We will have to put up with Dennis” - means we have to  have him as our boss, even though we don’t like it. He says, he, Dennis, is the most “incompetent” boss I’ve ever worked for. “Incompetent” (incompetent) means that you are not competent. “In” (in) as a prefix here means “not” and to be co mpetent means you’re able to do something, that you have the talent, you have the ability. So to be “incompetent” means that you do not have the talent , you do not have the ability or capacity to do something, and it’s of course a n egative word. If you say to someone, “You’re incompetent,” that’s a very negati ve insult, a very negative way of expressing your opinion, even if it’s true. Well , Kim, Katie rather - says, “He’s not that bad is he? I don’t have much contact with him.” To have “contact” (contact) with someone means that you talk to them,  or you see them, that you have some relationship with them that you have to c ommunicate with them. So “contact with” - here means the same as much commun ication with him, I don’t have to talk to him or see him, and so forth.

Tom says, “Are you kidding?” - means “Are you jokin g? He’s always sleeping on the job.” Well, “to sleep” of course, is what we do  at night and to “sleep on the job” means that you are sleeping or not doing what you are supposed to do. It doesn’t mean that he’s actually sleeping at his des k, for example. The expression “to be sleeping on the job” means you are not doing  your job. You are not doing what you’re supposed to do. If you are supposed to be working on your computer, typing a report, and you are instead look ing at different websites, or listening to ESL Podcast, you are sleeping on the j ob. You are not doing what you are supposed to be doing.

Tom says that the other day he was - Dennis, was su pposed to keep an eye on the supervisors. To “keep an eye (eye) on” someone means that you are supposed to watch them, you are supposed to take ca re of them. This expression can be used in lots of different ways. F or example, if you are sitting at a café, and you have your computer, your laptop com puter, and you need to go to the bathroom, you need to go to the restroom, yo u may say to your friend, “Could you keep an eye on my computer?” - means “Co uld you make sure no one steals it?” in this case, make sure that nothin g happens to it. So to keep an eye on is to watch, to supervise, to look after som ething.

Well, Dennis was supposed to keep an eye on the sup ervisors and of course, “supervisors” are bosses. In this case, people who are in the top management of a company. Tom says, “Instead of doing what he was supposed to do, in place of that, Dennis went to a baseball game, and the super visors ended up stranded at the downtown office.” “Ended up” (ended) - “up” (up ) - two words - to “end up” means to result in after a series of things happen.  The last thing that happens is how something ends up. For example, “I wanted to go  to the movies last night, but it was raining. So I ended up watching televisi on instead.” Usually, we use that expression when one thing is supposed to happe n but it doesn’t. So you do something different.

Well here, Dennis was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors, but he didn’t do that, he did something else and the result was that the supervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office. “To be stranded” ( stranded) - to be stranded means to be left somewhere with no transportation. If you are driving your car down the street, and you run out of gas, you have no more gasoline, you are stranded on the street. You are stranded at that pl ace means you don’t have any transportation. Well, in this case, the supervisors  were stranded at the downtown office. They were visiting from Salt Lake City. Sal t Lake City is a city in Utah - the state of Utah, and they ended up stranded. They had  no transportation, they couldn’t go anywhere and they were left at the down town office. Usually, we are stranded at some location. You could be stranded at  the airport - means your flight was cancelled or the airplane had a problem and you couldn’t go to where you wanted to go; you were stranded at that place.

Katie says that, “It’s hard to believe that Dennis would fall down on the job like that.” To “fall (fall) - down” (down) - two words - “to fall down on the job,” that expression means similar to be sleeping on the job,  not to do your job. Usually, it means when you do something wrong. So not only are you not doing it, but you are often doing it wrong. But in general, “to fall down on the job” means to not be doing the work you are supposed to be doing, like s ome of you right now, listening to this podcast. Tom says, “It’s not only that” - means that is not the only reason - it’s not only that. He says, “Dennis is always passing the buck.”  To “pass (pass) the buck” (buck) - means to give the responsibility for somet hing that went wrong to someone else. So, for example, your boss tells you to email one of your clients - one of your customers, and you forget to email them , and your boss talks to you and says, “Why didn’t you email this person?” and y ou say, “Oh, I thought John was going to e-mail him.” You are passing the buck,  you are putting the blame or the responsibility for something that went wrong on to someone else. There’s a famous expression for an American president, Harry S. Truman, who was president of the United States in the 1940s and ear ly 1950s, he had a sign - the

president had a sign on his desk that said, “The bu ck stops here,” meaning that he was ultimately responsible. If something went wr ong, he was the one to blame, because of course, he’s the president, he’s at the top of the government. So, “to pass the buck” means to give the responsibi lity for something that went wrong, to someone else, to blame someone else.

Tom says that “Every time something goes wrong at the factory, Dennis blames everyone but himself.” A “factory” (factory) is a p lace where you make something. So you could have a computer factory, where they ma ke computers, or a toy factory where they make toys. In this case, he says  that “Dennis blames everyone but himself” - means he blames everyone ex cept himself. He doesn’t take the responsibility himself.

Katie says, “If he’s as bad as you say he is, he mu st be on his way out.” “To be on your way out” means that you are going to be lea ving this job or this position soon. Usually, it means that you are probably going  to be fired, that you are going to lose your job. You have not lost it yet, b ut you are going to. If you say, “Oh, he’s on his way out” - means he’s going to be leaving his job, and perhaps being fired from his job soon. Well, Katie says tha t if Dennis is as bad as Tom says Dennis is, he must be on his way out. He’ll pr obably be leaving.

Katie then says, “But you know what they say, bette r the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.” “You know what they say” - that e xpression we use before a proverb, and a proverb (proverb) is a famous saying  or expression. The famous saying or expression that Katie uses here is “Bette r the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.” A “devil” (devil) is of course an  evil person. In the Christian religion, the devil is the person that tries to mak e you do something wrong - do evil. Well, the devil here when we say, “Better the  devil you know” means it’s better to have someone bad that you are familiar wi th than to bring someone else in new, who maybe even worse than the person you ha ve now. So better when we say, “Better the devil” - that’s short for “it is better that we have the devil - the bad person, the bad boss in this story, that we are  familiar with, than do lose him and maybe we’ll get an even worse boss. “Better the  devil you know, than the devil you don’t.”

Tom says, “Yeah I know, but I’m willing to take my chances.” “To take your chances” means I’m willing to risk something worse.  It means I’m open to the possibility that something may go wrong. We usually  use this expression when someone warns us, or tells us that something bad co uld happen. If we do what we plan on doing and you say, “Oh, I’ll take my cha nces.” So, for example, you want to go to the beach in the summertime and your friend says, “Well it’s going to be very crowded, lots of people there. It may be  difficult to find a place to

park,” and you say, “I’ll take my chances” - means I’m going to try it anyway. It’s something usually that you say when you are rejecti ng someone’s advice. When you are saying, “I’m not going to follow what you t ell me to do.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.
