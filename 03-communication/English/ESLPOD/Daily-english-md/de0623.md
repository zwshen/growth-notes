This episode is a dialogue between Flora and Saul.  Th ere has been a car accident.  One car – one automobile has hit another one  and then immediately left.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  What happened to my car?!

Saul:  I saw it happen.  A car came around the corner a nd hit the back of your car.

Flora:  Didn’t the driver stop?

Saul:  No, it was hit-and-run.  The driver just took of f.  He was driving like a bat out of hell.  It looks like he caused some damage.

Flora:  Some damage?!  My car is totaled.  I hope whoe ver it was gets his license revoked.  Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book a t him and he does jail time.  But how are the police going to catch someone wh o leaves the scene of the crime like this?  That guy must be a real jerk!

Saul:  Take it easy.  Maybe he just panicked.  It’s probabl y his first offense. Maybe he’s young and just learning how to drive.

Flora:  Maybe…Hey, why are you defending the driver?

Saul:  Well…

 Flora:  You know the person driving the car, don’t you ?  You’re not an innocent bystander.  You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!

Saul:  Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, and he drives too fast.  He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender  bender.

Flora:  Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.

Saul:  I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks.  If you don ’t call the police, I’ll make sure it’s repaired.  It’ll be as good as new.

Flora:  Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?

Saul:  No, not at all.  I’ll get your car fixed, righ t after I wring my nephew’s neck!

Flora begins the dialogue by saying, “What happened to my car?!”  Saul said, “I saw it happen (whatever happened, he saw it).  A car cam e around the corner and hit the back of your car.”  So, a car was driving on one street, then turned right or left and started to drive down another street .  He came around the corner, and then he hit the back of Flora’s car.

Flora says, “Did the driver stop?” meaning did he stop t his car and get out to see if he had hit anything.  Saul says, “No, it was hit-and- run.”  “Hit-and-run” is a type of car accident where one driver hits a person or hits ano ther car and then leaves immediately, without stopping to see if he has hurt any one or damaged the car because he doesn’t want to get in trouble with the pol ice perhaps or he doesn’t have car insurance, which is required in most states in the U.S.  It’s illegal to hit a car and then leave immediately.  Hit-and-run accidents in most states will cause you to go to jail if the police find you, so you’d never  want to do that.  Well, that’s what this driver did.

Saul says, “The driver just took off.”  “To take off” is a  two-word phrasal verb meaning to leave a place very quickly, without saying goodbye .  “Take off” actually has several meanings in English; take a look at the  Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Saul says that this driver w as driving like a bat out of hell.  This is an old expression.  A “bat” (bat) is an  animal that flies at night, can bite you, and is often found in dark places.  “Hell”  is the word we describe the place where you go if you are not good in this world – after you die, that is.  So, “a bat out of hell” means that the bat was going very q uickly.  Perhaps the bat is

 escaping hell, I’m not sure.  But it’s an old expression that means to go very quickly and dangerously.  “He was driving like a bat out of  hell.”  It’s an informal expression; it’s not something you would use among childre n perhaps.  I used to hear this expression growing up; it was more common, I sup pose, a few years ago, but you will still hear it.  Saul says that it loo ks like he caused some damage.  The driver caused some damage to Flora’s car.  “ Damage” is when you break something or harm something – injure a person pe rhaps.  It’s something that makes the object in worse condition.  Usually “damag e” is about a thing, not a person, although you could say “I damaged my hand,” bu t you would more likely say “I hurt my hand” or I “injured my hand.”  But you wouldn’t say “I injured my table,” you would say “I damaged my table” or “I dama ged my car.”  So that’s what happened here; the man cause some damage.

Flora says, “Some damage?!  My car is totaled.”  Somethi ng that is “totaled” in this case means completely destroyed, ruined, something you ca n no longer fix, you can no longer use.  We usually use this word in talking  about cars.  “The car was in an accent and it was totaled,” meaning you could n ot fix the car.  Flora says, “I hope whoever it was (whoever hit her) gets his li cense revoked.”  “To revoke” (revoke) means to cancel some official permission tha t you have, or a license.  In the U.S., each state has it’s own driver’s li cense, and you must get a driver’s license from at least one state to drive in the U .S.  If you have an international driver’s license that’s okay, too.  “To revoke  a license” then means that the state says you can no longer drive, we are taking  away your license – we’re revoking it.  Flora says, “Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book at him and he does jail time.”  A “judge” is the person in an  official court of law, where you go if you have committed a crime.  The judge typically determines what your punishment will be.  Flora says she hopes the judge thro ws the book at him. This expression, “to throw the book at (someone),” means to punish someone very severely, very badly, maybe saying that they committed man y crimes and must spend many years in jail – in prison.  That’s to thr ow the book at someone. Usually we use this when we are talking about a judge; it could be used in talking about, for example, a principal – the head of a school who has to punish students.  It’s possible.

Well, Flora hopes the judge throws the book at this per son, and that the person does jail time.  “To do jail (jail) time” means to spe nd time in prison – to spend time in jail because you have done something wrong; you h ave broken the law, we would say, you did something against the law.  Flora is, of course, very angry. She says, “But how are the police going to catch (going to find) someone who leaves the scene of the crime like this?”  The “scene (scene) of the crime” is where the crime happened, where it was committed.  A “crime” is, of course,

 what you do that is against the law.  To steal is a crime ; to kill someone is a crime.  So, the scene of the crime is where the crime hap pened.  Flora doesn’t think the police could find someone who has left the scene  of the crime.  Then she says, “That guy must be a real jerk!”  A “jerk” is an in formal way of calling someone a very stupid or bad person.

Saul says, “Take it easy (meaning calm down, don’t be so excited).  Maybe this man was just panicked.”  “To be panicked” means that you are afraid, that you are very anxious, you don’t know what to do.  You often do the wrong thing when you panic.  Saul says, “It’s probably his first offense,” me aning it’s probably the first time that this person has had a problem, has broken  the law, has committed a crime.  He says, “Maybe he’s young and just learning how  to drive.”

Flora says, “Maybe.”  Then she says, “Hey, why are you defe nding the driver?” “To defend (someone)” means to do something or say someth ing that protects the other person, to say the other person is not guilty,  they’re innocent.  Saul says, “Well…”  Flora says, “You know the person driving the car, don’t you?” She thinks Saul knows who the driver is – the name of the  driver.  Flora says, “You’re not an innocent bystander.”  A “bystander” is some one who just happens to be somewhere and see something that has happened.  It’s a person who did not do anything wrong, but they usually saw someone who did do something wrong or were in the same place as the person who did something wrong. “Innocent” is the opposite of “guilty,” meaning you didn ’t do anything wrong.  But Flora doesn’t think Saul is an innocent bystander.  She says, “You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!”  “To talk (someone) out of (something)” means to convince or persuade another person not to do something,  to make them change their mind about doing something.  “The parents trie d to talk their daughter out of getting a tattoo.”  They tried to convince her not to p ut ink permanently on her skin.  Something you should never do for your boyfriend or  girlfriend, because someday, perhaps, they will not be your boyfriend or girl friend any longer.  I’m not speaking from personal experience, mind you!

Well, Flora says that Saul is trying to talk her out of calling the police.  Saul says, “Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, an d he drives too fast. He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender bender.”  So Saul’s nephew, which is the son of his sister or brother, borrowed Saul’s car and  hit Flora’s car.  He was the person who caused the accident.  But Saul says it’s not  a serious accident; it’s a “fender bender,” a minor car accident, not serio us.

Flora says, “Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.”  I shou ld explain that the “fender” is the front part of your car that usually is wh at hits another car first.  “To bend” means to take something that is straight and mak e it so that it is not straight.  So, a “fender ender” would be taking your fender, which is straight, and making it so that it isn’t straight because you hit it.

Flora says, “Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.”  Saul says, “I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks.  If you don’t call the police, I’ll make  sure it’s repaired (I will do what is necessary to repair it).  It will be as good as ne w.”  “As good as new” means just like new, as if the damage had never happened .

Flora says, “Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?”  “To pull a fast one on (someone)” means to trick them, to fool them, to make them believe something is true that isn’t true.  Saul says, “No, not at all (I’m not trying to pull a fast one on you).  I’ll get your car fixed (repaired), right after  (or immediately after) I wring my nephew’s neck!”  “To wring (wring) (someone’s) neck” lite rally means to choke or strangle someone by putting your hands around their neck.  The neck is, of course, what connects your head to the rest of your body.  “To wring someone’s neck” would mean basically to kill them.  Now of course, Sa ul isn’t going to kill or strangle his nephew, even if he wants to.  It’s a phrase we use to emphasize our anger at someone, to show how mad we are: “If I find the person who hit my car, I’ll wring his neck.”  Or a wife might say, “If my husban d doesn’t come back in an hour, when he does I’ll wring his neck.”  You see, it’s something you would not use about a boss or in a formal situation.  It’s used to express a great deal of anger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
