This episode is a dialog between Danny and Sybil ab out how you correct someone in a conversation. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Danny:  You look like you need to relax.

Sybil:  Excuse me?

Danny:  What I mean is, you look like you could use  some R and R.

Sybil:  I didn’t know I looked tired and worn out.

Danny:  No, what I’m trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.

Sybil:  Yes, that’s certainly true.

Danny:  The human body needs downtime to recuperate  and to regenerate.

Sybil:  Okay, I guess that’s true.

Danny:  Let me rephrase that.  People need time awa y from work to get ready for more work.

Sybil:  Are you saying you’re planning on giving me  more work?

Danny:  No, no, no.  Let me put it another way.  It ’s imperative that you don’t work this weekend.

Sybil:  Why?  What’s going on this weekend?  Are yo u saying that something big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m  being left out?

Danny:  No, not at all.  What I’m trying to say is. ..[sigh]...would you like to go out with me Saturday night?

Sybil:  Oh, I guess I didn’t catch your drift earli er.  You’re asking me out for Saturday.

Danny:  Yes, I am.

Sybil:  Then, I accept.

Danny:  Really?

Sybil:  Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me  out on a first date ever again!

[end of dialog]

Danny begins a dialog by saying to Sybil, “You look  like you need to relax.” You look like you need to be calmer, less worried, less  anxious. Sybil says, “Excuse me?” The expression “excuse me” is used in a lot of  different ways. Here it's used when someone says something to you and you don 't really understand why they said it. You might also be a little upset or a ngry that they said this to you, so you're indicating your displeasure, the fact that y ou don't like what they said.

That's why Sybil says “Excuse me?” She's not very h appy that Danny has told her that she needs to relax. Danny then corrects hi mself. He says, “What I mean is you look like you could use some R and R.” The p hrase “what I mean is,” is used when you've just said something that the other  person didn't understand, or you don't think the other person understood correct ly, and you want to give another way of saying it. You want to say it in a d ifferent way. So, when Sybil says, “Excuse me,” indicating she didn't like what Danny said, Danny says, “What I mean is, you look like you could use some R and R .” “R and R” stands for “Rest and Relaxation.”

Sybil said, “I didn't know I looked tired and worn out.” Sybil thinks that Danny is criticizing her, in a way, saying that she looks ti red and worn out. “To be worn (worn) out” means to be very tired, both physically  and perhaps mentally. Danny realizes that Sybil still doesn't like the way he e xpressed his idea. So, he uses another phrase to correct himself again.

 He says, “No, what I'm trying to say is, people nee d leisure time once in a while.” “What I'm trying to say is” means the same as “what  I mean is.” It's an expression or a phrase you would use in a conversation when yo u need to correct yourself, or you need to say something in a different way. Da nny says that people need leisure time once in a while. “Leisure” (leisure) m eans time that you do what you enjoy, time that you do some activity that isn't wo rk.

Finally, Sybil seems to understand what he's saying . She says, “Yes, that's certainly true.” Danny continues, “The human body n eeds downtime to recuperate and to regenerate.” He is saying that ou r bodies, our physical bodies, need “downtime.” “Downtime” – one word – is time th at you don't have anything scheduled. It’s time where you are just going to do  whatever you feel like doing. It's similar to leisure, although you could have do wntime at your work, where you don't have anything scheduled. You can relax a litt le, but still have to think of something to do. “Downtime” in this conversation, in this dialog, means something closer to leisure, relaxation.

“The body needs downtime,” Danny says, “to recupera te.” “To recuperate” (recuperate) means to recover, usually to recover f rom some sort of sickness or illness. In this case, the body needs time to recup erate, to get its energy back. “To regenerate” is another verb that Danny uses her e. “Regenerate” (regenerate) means to become renewed, almost to take on a new li fe. It's not that common of an expression or a verb in cases such as this, but it's possible to say that the body needs time to regenerate. Literally, it means to “make again,” to generate again, to create again.

Sybil says, “Okay. I guess that's true.” Again, Syb il is not perhaps happy with what Danny has said, and Danny sensing this, seeing  this, says, “Let me rephrase that.” “To rephrase” (rephrase) means to e xpress an idea in a different way, especially if the first time you said it wasn' t exactly what you wanted to say or was unclear. This is another way of correcting y ourself, of saying, “Wait a minute. Let me say this in a different way.” Danny says, “Let me rephrase that. People need time away from work to get ready for mo re work.” Now Danny is presenting a little different idea. He’s saying tha t we need down time and leisure so that we can work even more.

Sybil says, “Are you saying you're planning on givi ng me more work?” Now we realize Danny appears to be Sybil’s boss. So, Sybil  asks Danny if he is planning on giving her more work, and that's why he's tellin g her to relax and so forth. Danny says, “No, no, no. Let me put it another way. ” “To put something another way” is to say it in a different way. This is anoth er expression, another phrase

you can use when you want to correct what you just said or when the person misunderstood you. “Let me put it another way.” It means the same as “Let me rephrase that.”

Danny says, “It's imperative that you don't work th is weekend.” Something that is “imperative” (imperative) is something that is extr emely important, something that is necessary, something that is required. Danny is saying, “It's imperative that you do not work this weekend.” Sybil says, “Why?” “ What's going on? – What's happening? – “this weekend? Are you saying that som ething big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m being left out? ” “To be left out” means not to be included in some activity or some discussion.  We could also say “to be excluded.” That's “to be left out.”

Now Sybil is worrying that Danny doesn't want her to be part of something important. Danny says, “No, not at all,” meaning “N o, you're not being left out.” “What I'm trying to say is,” and he sighs – he goes  [sighing] – “would you like to go out with me Saturday night?” Danny, who remember , we think is Sybil’s boss, is asking her out on a date, is asking if she would  like to go and spend time with him this weekend. He said, “Would you like to go ou t with me this weekend?” – Saturday night. “To go out with someone” means to g o on a date with them. I'm not sure if this is a good idea for the boss to be asking one of his employees out on a date. Most companies don't like that. Well, Da nny is doing it anyway!

Sybil says, “Oh, I didn't catch your drift earlier. ” “To catch someone's drift” (drift) is an old expression meaning to understand the main  idea of what someone else is saying, to get the general idea of what another person is telling you. Sybil says she did not catch Danny's drift earlier. She says, “You're asking me out for Saturday.” Danny says, “Yes, I am.”

Sybil says, “Then, I accept.” Danny says, “Really?”  He’s surprised. And he should be. I mean, Danny is not an attractive perso n. I mean, he’s not as good- looking as Sybil. Danny says, “Really?” Sybil says,  “Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me out on a first date ever again.” Sy bil is making a little joke here. Of course, you can only ask someone out on a first date once. You can only do something the first time once. She's also saying th at Danny did not do a very good job on asking her out on this date, and I thin k we can all agree that's true.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
