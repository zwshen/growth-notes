In the biological autosomic inheritance, each characteristic of one
individual is determined by a pair of genes (a gene is a part of a
chromosome). When a pair of genes presents different information for
one characteristic, the dominance of one gene over the other naturally
influences the way an individual externally presents that
characteristic.

</p><p align="justify">

In the case of total dominance, a dominant gene imposes the external
appearance of its information over the other gene of the pair. The
information of a recessive gene (the dominated gene) is only
externally shown if there is no dominant gene in the
pair. The information of a dominant gene is represented by a capital
letter, while the information of a recessive gene is represented by a
small letter. One individual that possesses a pair of genes with equal
information for the same characteristic is called homozigotic,
otherwise it is called heterozigotic.

<font color="#000000">In the guinee-pigs, the gene for the black colour (<i>B</i>) is
dominant over the gene for the white colour (<i>w</i>). The
descendants' genetic types (composition of the pair of genes) of two
parents are obtained by generating the different possible combinations
of the 4 genes of the parents.  Each ascendant contributes with only
one gene to the pair of genes of the descendant. For instance, one
heterozigotic guinee-pig (<i>Bw</i>) presents the same colour of one
black homozigotic guinee-pig (<i>BB</i>). The descendants of two black
homozigotic guinee-pigs (<i>BB</i>) have 100% probability of also
being black homozigotic individuals. An analogous situation occurs
with the descendants of two white homozigotic guinee-pigs (<i>ww</i>),
i.e., they have 100% probability of also being white
homozigotic individuals.  The descendants of one black homozigotic
guinee-pig (<i>BB</i>) and one white homozigotic guinee-pig
(<i>ww</i>) have 100% probability of being black heterozigotic
individuals. The following figure illustrates this description.

Imagine that you don't know, for a particular guinee-pig, who were its
parents (1-ascendants), or its grand-parents (2-ascendants), or its
great-grand-parents (3-ascendants). Your task is to write a program
that lists the genes of the possible <i>n</i>-ascendants (ascendants
of level <i>n</i>) of that individual and the associated probability
of each pair of possible <i>n</i>-ascendants. Assume the maximum
value of <i>n</i> is 35.


<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Input</h2></font>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described 
below. Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line. </b></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000"> 

The first line of the input contains the
genes of the guinee-pig for whom you want to know the probable
<i>n</i>-ascendants. The second line contains the value of <i>n</i>,
i.e., the level of ascendant generation that you want to study.<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Output</h2></font>

</font></p><p align="justify"><b>For each test case, the output must follow the 
description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a 
blank line. </b><p align="justify"><font color="#000000"> 

The output is a list of lines, each one containing the concatenated
genes of each member of the possible pair of <i>n</i>-ascendants,
followed by the corresponding probability, truncated to 2 fractional
digits.  The concatenation of the 2 pair of <i>n</i>-ascendant genes
must ensure that the resultant string is the biggest one, considering
<i>BBBB</i> &gt; <i>BBBw</i> &gt; <i>BBwB</i> &gt;... &gt; <i>wwwB</i>
&gt; <i>wwww</i>.  The output must be sorted in descending order by
value of the concatenation of the 2 pair of <i>n</i>-ascendant
genes. Before printing any floating point value add <b>10<sup>-11</sup></b>to 
avoid round off error.<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Sample Input</h2></font>
