This episode is a dialogue between Vivian and Guy ( notice Guy can be a man’s name as well as a general term for a man) about the  all-too-common problem of cancer. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vivian: Do you see this lump? I’m sure I have cance r.

Guy: Don’t jump to conclusions. It could be somethi ng completely benign.

Vivian: I know it’s not benign. It’s got to be a ma lignant tumor. The cancer is probably at stage two or three already. The oncolog ist will probably want to start me on radiation and chemotherapy right away.

Guy: You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and you’r e already planning for the worst.

Vivian: Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepa red for the bad news. The doctor will do a biopsy, but I already know what the results will be. I’m just hoping the prognosis will be good.

Guy: I think you’re getting way ahead of yourself. It could be something completely harmless.

Vivian: I can’t afford to believe that. I have a fa mily history of cancer. My father was diagnosed when he was 56 years old. It’s true h e’s been in remission and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with c ancer.

Guy: That’s right, you never know. You could live t o the age of 90.

Vivian: You can fool yourself as much as you like, but I have to face facts – especially as sick as I am.

[end of dialogue]

Vivian begins our dialogue by asking Guy, “Do you s ee this lump? I’m sure I have cancer.” A “lump” (lump) is a small bump or piece of something that, when we’re talking about the body, is right below your skin. T here’s something like a little ball underneath your skin that you can feel – that’s a “ lump.” “Cancer” (cancer) is a disease caused when cells in some part of your body  begin to grow and make you sick. “Cancer” can, of course, kill you, and un happily does in some cases.

Guy says to Vivian, “Don’t jump to conclusions.” Vi vian thinks that she has cancer just because she found a lump on her body. “ To jump to conclusions” means to think that you know the answer to a questi on before you have all the information necessary to know the answer. “To jump to conclusions” is to try to make a decision or reach a conclusion before having  all of the necessary information.

Guy says, “It,” meaning the lump, “could be somethi ng completely benign.” A “benign” (benign) lump would be a lump that would n ot be harmful or deadly. The word “benign” means that it doesn’t cause any harm,  that it won’t hurt you. Vivian, however, says, “I know it’s not benign. It’ s got to be a malignant tumor.” The word “malignant” (malignant) here means the opp osite of benign – something that will hurt you. A “tumor” (tumor) is a kind of cancer growth that can spread throughout your body and ultimately kill you .

Vivian says, “The cancer is probably at stage two o r stage three already.” Cancers are often classified by how serious they ar e, or how advanced they are – how much the cancer has spread throughout your bo dy. The classification system is based on stages. A “stage” (stage) here m eans one step in a process, one level of progress or advancement of a certain t hing – in this case, the growth of the cancer.

The higher the number of the stage, the more advanc ed and serious the cancer has become. Stage one is not as serious as stage fo ur, which I believe is the highest stage used when talking about the spread of  cancer, the growth of the cancerous cells in your body. Vivian thinks she’s a lready at stage two or three, which would be somewhat unusual, but possible. “The  oncologist,” she says, “will probably want to start me on radiation and chemothe rapy right away.”

 Vivian doesn’t even know if she has cancer and she’ s already assuming all sorts of things such as that her cancer is already at sta ge two or three. She also thinks the oncologist will start her on radiation and chem otherapy. An “oncologist” (oncologist) is a doctor who specializes in diagnos ing and treating cancer. “To diagnose” (diagnose) means to identify a problem, u sually a medical problem that you have. An oncologist can determine if you h ave cancer and treat the cancer. “To treat” cancer means to try to stop the cancer to cure you.

Vivian mentions “radiation” and “chemotherapy.” “Ra diation” (radiation) is the use of high energy that kills cancer cells and makes the tumors smaller. It’s a medical treatment. “Chemotherapy” (chemotherapy) is the use  of injections of chemicals, chemicals that are put into your body to kill the c ancer cells.

Guy says, “You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and  you’re already planning for the worst.” Guy is saying you haven’t even talked t o one doctor and you already are “planning for the worst” – the worst possible c ase. Vivian says, “Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepared for the bad news .” “To be mentally prepared” means that you think about a problem and are ready for the worst possible case of that problem or worst possible resolution of tha t problem, perhaps.

Vivian says, “The doctor will do a biopsy, but I al ready know what the results will be.” A “biopsy” (biopsy) is a medical procedure whe re a small amount of your body is removed and tested – in this case, it would  be tested to see if you had cancer. Vivian says, “I’m just hoping the prognosis  will be good.” “Prognosis” (prognosis) is what a doctor thinks will happen to you with a certain disease. “Diagnosis” means the doctor identifies the problem . A “prognosis” is what the doctor thinks will happen to you. Will you continue  to live for the next 10 years? Will you die in six months? Those would be examples  of prognoses. It’s a prediction about what will happen to you in terms of your health.

Guy says, “I think you’re getting way ahead of your self.” “To get ahead of yourself” or “way ahead of yourself” means to say o r do something sooner than you should, especially if you have jumped to conclu sions – if you have made up your mind before you have all the information that you need to make a decision. You can also get way ahead of yourself by making pr eparations for something that hasn’t even happened yet.

So for example, you meet a beautiful girl at a bar and you get her phone number. You go home and you start planning your wedding wit h this woman. You start thinking about how many children you want to have w ith this woman. That would be a very good example of getting way ahead of your self. Notice the use of the

word “way” (way) here. It just means “very much” – really ahead of yourself, perhaps.

Guy says, “It” – meaning again the lump – “could be  something completely harmless.” Vivian responds, “I can’t afford to beli eve that.” If someone says they “can’t afford (afford) to” do something, the person  means it’s not possible for them, because if they did, it would cause them more  harm. The risk of something bad happening is too great.

Vivian says, “I have a family history of cancer.” A  “family history” of some disease or illness means that other members of your family have had that disease. In my case, I have a family history of heart disease. My father had heart disease, as did some of my uncles. Vivian says, “My father was diag nosed when he was 56 years old.” “My father was diagnosed” – meaning the  doctors said that he had cancer – when he was only 56. “It’s true,” Vivian continues, “he’s been in remiss ion and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with cancer.”

If your cancer is “in remission” (remission), your cancer seems to have stopped or gotten better or possibly even disappeared. If y our cancer is in remission, you’re healthy, at least for now. Vivian says her f ather has been in remission from his cancer and hasn’t had a “relapse” yet. A “ relapse” (relapse) is a return to a previous state or condition of bad health. So, yo u get better and then you get worse again. Getting worse again would be the relap se, going back to the condition you started with.

Guy says, “That’s right, you never know.” Vivian ha s said that, quote, “You never know with cancer.” When someone says “you never kno w,” he means it is not possible for you to predict. Guy says, “That’s righ t, you could live to the age of 90.” Vivian says, “You can fool yourself as much as  you like, but I have to face facts.” “To fool (fool) yourself” means to make you  believe something that isn’t true – to hide the truth from yourself.

Vivian says she has to face facts. The expression “ to face (face) facts (facts)” means to accept reality, to accept the truth, espec ially when it’s a difficult or painful truth that you have to accept. Vivian is co nvinced that she has cancer, and that’s why she ends by saying that she has to f ace facts, “especially as sick as I am.” Vivian believes she’s sick even though sh e hasn’t gone to a doctor yet.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Vivian: Do you see this lump? I’m sure I have cance r.

Guy: Don’t jump to conclusions. It could be somethi ng completely benign.

Vivian: I know it’s not benign. It’s got to be a ma lignant tumor. The cancer is probably at stage two or three already. The oncolog ist will probably want to start me on radiation and chemotherapy right away.

Guy: That’s right, you never know. You could live t o the age of 90.

Vivian: You can fool yourself as much as you like, but I have to face facts – especially as sick as I am.

Our scriptwriter never jumps to conclusions. She’s always looking at the facts and then making the right decision, as she does in every script that she writes. Thank you, Dr. Lucy Tse.
