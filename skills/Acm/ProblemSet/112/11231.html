<h1>Problem B: Black and white painting</h1>
</center>
<p>You are visiting the Centre Pompidou which contains a lot of modern
paintings.
In particular you notice one painting which consists solely of black
and white
squares, arranged in rows and columns like in a chess board (no two
adjacent
squares have the same colour). By the way, the artist did not use the
tool of problem A to create the painting.</p>
<p>Since you are bored, you wonder how many <i>8 &times; 8</i>
chess boards are embedded within this
painting. The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.</p>

<h4>Input Specification</h4>
<p>
The input contains several test cases.
Each test case consists of one line with three integers
<strong>n</strong>, <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>.
(<i>8 &le; n, m &le; 40000</i>), where <strong>n</strong> is the number of
rows of the painting, and <strong>m</strong> is the number of columns
of the painting. <strong>c</strong> is always <i>0</i> or <i>1</i>,
where <i>0</i> indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting
is black, and <i>1</i> indicates that this corner is white.
</p>
<p>
The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.
</p>
<h4>Output Specification</h4>
<p>
For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded
within the given painting.
