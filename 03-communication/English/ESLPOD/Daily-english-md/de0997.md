This episode is a dialogue between Oscar and Liz ab out writing your memoir – the story of your life. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Oscar: We’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing you r memoir with our company. You’ve had such an interesting life. I’m sure you’l l have lots of titillating stories to tell.

Liz: Well, my memoir will certainly have a lot of s tories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encou ntered in this industry.

Oscar: That’s nice, but people buy autobiographical  books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.

Liz: I was really thinking of focusing on the peopl e who helped me in my career and their selflessness.

Oscar: But I thought you were interested in writing  a tell-all book. Considering how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must have lots of steamy stories.

Liz: I don’t want to be telling tales about people I love or once loved. I want to focus on the positive.

Oscar: You could do that, but your books won’t fly off the shelves without those juicy details.

Liz: Really?

 Oscar: Really.

Liz: Maybe I could tell one or two scandalous stori es.

Oscar: Now you’re talking.

Liz: There was that infamous party where a cat figh t broke out between . . .

We begin our dialogue with Oscar saying to Liz, “We ’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing your memoir with our company. You’ve had  such an interesting life. I’m sure you’ll have lots of titillating stories to  tell.” Oscar says that he and his company are “thrilled.” “To be thrilled” means to b e very excited, to be very pleased with something.

“To publish” means to create a book, a newspaper, o r a magazine – typically, things that are printed on paper and then you buy. However, that’s the traditional definition of “publish.” Now people publish things electronically. The more general use of the term, then, is to make something availab le for people to buy. It’s usually in the form of a book or a magazine or news paper. You can also publish on a blog. So, the Internet has really changed our definition of “publish.”

Oscar is talking about publishing Liz’s memoir. A “ memoir” (memoir) is a written account of your life. It’s an “autobiography,” we c ould also call it. It’s the story of your life. Oscar says that Liz’s stories are almost  certain to be titillating. “To be titillating” (titillating) means to be very interes ting or exciting, often in a possibly romantic or even sexual way. That’s the meaning of “titillating.”

Liz says, “Well, my memoir will certainly have lots  of stories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encou ntered in this industry.” Liz is talking about her memoir having a lot of stories ab out her career. Your “career” is roughly your work life. We suspect that Liz is prob ably an actress or perhaps a singer, someone who’s famous.

She is going to talk about the people she’s worked with and the kindness she’s encountered, or she has been met with, in this indu stry. “Industry” (industry) usually refers to a group of companies, all of whom  make the same kinds of products or provide the same kinds of services. We could talk about the “automobile industry” – the group of companies that  make automobiles. We could

talk about the “entertainment industry” – all of the companies that make movies and television shows and records and so forth.

Here in Los Angeles, when someone says “the industr y,” they are referring to the entertainment industry, because the entertainment i ndustry is so important here in Los Angeles, nobody even calls it the “entertain ment industry” or the “movie industry.” They just say “the industry.” And when y ou say that to someone in Los Angeles, they know you’re talking about the enterta inment industry. Liz doesn’t say what industry she’s talking about, but we can g uess that it’s probably “the industry” in the Los Angeles sense of that term.

Oscar says, “That’s nice, but people buy autobiogra phical books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.” “Autobiog raphical” refers to your own life, things that you have written about yourself. Most p eople don’t think about publishing autobiographies until they are older, al though there are some celebrities and politicians who have published memo irs or autobiographies in their 20s and 30s and 40s, apparently believing tha t their lives are so interesting that everyone wants to know about them. Maybe I sho uld publish my memoir, my autobiography. I’ll have to think about that. I don ’t think my life is very interesting, unfortunately. I could always invent some things – make some things up.

Anyway, Oscar is saying that people buy these memoi rs, these autobiographical books, “for the juicy details.” “Juicy” (juicy) her e means interesting, but also shocking. Oscar says that these details should be s alacious, “the more salacious, the better,” he says, meaning the more salacious the details, the better the book will be. “Salacious” (salacious), like titillating,  also refers to things that are shocking, exciting, or scandalous, but related spec ifically to something sexual.

Liz says, “I was really thinking of focusing on the  people who helped me in my career and their selflessness.” “Selflessness” (sel flessness) refers to putting other people’s needs and desires before your own. “ Selflessness” is the opposite of a more common phenomenon and word, “selfishness”  (selfishness). “To be selfish” means to only be thinking about yourself. “To be selfless” means to be thinking about other people and not yourself.

Oscar says, “But I thought you were interested in w riting a tell-all book.” A “tell-all book” is a book that gives people the details of on e’s life, including secrets that no one has ever heard before. Oscar says, “Consider ing how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must h ave lots of steamy stories.” Oscar is referring to Liz’s past. Apparently, she h as been married more than once and has had “affairs” (affairs).

The word “affairs” has a couple of different meanin gs, but here it means having a romantic relationship with someone to whom you are not married. You’re married to one person, but you’re having a romantic relatio nship with another person. That’s called “having an affair.” Oscars thinks tha t Liz has a lot of “steamy” (steamy) stories to tell. “Steamy” is similar to “s alacious,” that we discussed earlier.

Liz says, “I don’t want to be telling tales about p eople I love or once loved.” “To tell tales” means to tell stories, especially stori es that are not completely true. Liz says, “I want to focus on the positive” – the good things that have happened in her life. Oscar says, “You could do that, but your books won’t fly off the shelves without those juicy details.” “To fly off the shelv es” (shelves) means to sell very quickly. “Shelves” is the plural of “shelf” (shelf) , which is a place where you will find goods in the store to buy.

If you go into a grocery store, for example, there are lots of different shelves, usually three or four shelves in one area, and you have different types of food on each shelf. “To fly off the shelves” means to sell quickly, as if the goods that you are selling are somehow flying up into the air, the y’re being purchased so quickly. Liz says, “Really?” She’s surprised at what Oscar is telling her. Oscars says, “Really.”

Liz then says, “Maybe I could tell one or two scand alous stories.” “Scandalous” (scandalous) is very shocking in a bad sort of way.  Realizing her book will not sell very well unless she tells some scandalous sto ries, Liz agrees to do so. Oscar is happy. He says, “Now you’re talking.” That  expression, “now you’re talking,” is used when you are agreeing with what the other person is saying. You’re telling the other person, “Yes, that’s exact ly the kind of thing I want to hear.”

Liz says, “There was that infamous party where a ca tfight broke out between . . .” – and then the dialogue ends. “Infamous” (infamous)  is famous in a bad way. You can be famous for doing something good. You can  be “infamous” for doing something bad. Strangely, however, in recent years,  people have started to use “infamous” to mean the same as “famous,” even thoug h the traditional definition is being famous for doing something wrong, for doing something bad. You do not want to be infamous.

A “catfight” is a fight between two or more women. Why are they cats and not dogs? I’m not sure, but that’s the term we use when  referring to a physical fight between two or more women. You can’t say “dogfight”  for a fight between two or more men, however. It doesn’t work that way. In fac t, the word “dogfight” means

a fight between two airplanes up in the air fightin g each other, as in a war. That’s a dogfight.

Then, of course, there’s a “bullfight” that you mig ht see in Spain or Mexico, where they actually kill a bull. But we’re not talking ab out killing anyone here. We’re just talking about fighting, and that’s what Liz may tel l about in her memoir.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
