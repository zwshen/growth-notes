This episode is a dialogue between Lee and Kira about something called a “spoiler,” which is when you tell someone how a movie or a television show ends – what its conclusion is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lee:  I’m reading this article about the new season of our favorite show.  It’s premiering next week.

Kira:  Don’t tell me anything about it, especially spoil ers.

Lee:  But don’t you want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?

Kira:  No, I don’t!  I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews.  It spoils the fun when you already know what’s going to happen.  Where’s the suspense?

Lee:  The blogs and reviews I read all have “spoiler al erts” and I avoid reading those sections.  Let me just tell you one thing I read…

Kira:  Stop right there!  I’m covering my ears.  I wan t to stay in the dark, completely in the dark.  Got it?

Lee:  Okay, I won’t let the cat out of the bag, but we ’re in for a wild ride this season.

Kira:  I’m not listening!  I’m not listening!

Lee begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m reading this art icle about the new season of our favorite show.”  A “season” (season) here means a period of time when a series of television programs are being shown.  There’s u sually, in the United States, a fall and spring television season, when televisi on programs begin.  The word “season,” however, has a couple of different meanin gs in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.

Lee says that the television show that he and Kira like is premiering next week. “To premiere” means to be shown for the very first time .  If the television show premieres tomorrow, that means that it is the first tim e you have seen that show or that series of shows on television; it’s the first time .  You can also have a movie that premieres; we have lots of movies that premie re here in Los Angeles. The noun is, simply, “premiere.”

Kira says, “Don’t tell me anything about it, especially the spoilers.”  A “spoiler” is something that is said or written that lets other peopl e know what happens at the end of a book, a movie, or a television show.  Most of us don’t want to know how the show ends or the movie ends, and if you do that it’ s called a “spoiler.”  “Spoil” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lee says, “But don’t you want to know which guest stars wil l be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?”  A “guest star” is an actor who appears on just one or two, maybe three shows, but is someone who is not a regular part of the television program.  “To make an  appearance” means to be present, to come to an event or to be on a show.  “He m ade an appearance on the television show” means he was on the TV show, probabl y not for a very long time however.  A “plot twist” (twist) is something unexpe cted that happens in the story, especially in a book or a movie.  A boy falls in love with a girl, and then halfway through the book the boy sees the girl’s sister an d falls in love with her sister.  That would be a “plot twist.”  That would also  probably end his first relationship with the other sister, but that’s too compl icated to talk about here! “Plot” is simply the story, so a “plot twist” is a change in  the story.  When we use the expression “coming up,” we mean it will happen in t he near future, it will happen soon.  This is an expression you often see on televisi on: “Coming up next, we’ll learn if Rachel and Ross actually kiss!”  That’s the next thing that we will see on the program.  Often that happens right be fore a commercial or advertising break to get you to come back, to stay with the program to see what happens.

 Kira answers Lee’s question: “No, I don’t!” meaning I d on’t want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twi sts that are coming up. She says, “I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews.”  A “movie trailer” (trailer) is an advertisement for a movie, often shown i n the movie theater before the movie you are going to see begins.  So, you sit down  to watch a movie, but first they show you advertisements for other movies.  These  are called “movie trailers.”  You can also see movie trailers on the Web no w.  A “review” means, in this case, a written opinion about a movie, a book, or a  television show; really anything, someone’s opinion about some product or some m ovie, something that is entertaining or interesting.  It could be in a new spaper; it could be on a website.  Many newspapers have “movie reviewers,” who every w eek, give their opinion about a movie and whether you should go to see  it.

Well, Kira doesn’t read reviews.  She says that they spoil the fun when you already know what’s going to happen.  “To spoil,” as a ve rb, means to ruin something, to make something less fun or less useful, or perhaps even less helpful: “I went out to dinner with my wife last nigh t, but the evening was spoiled because there was a crying child in the table next to me.”   My evening was spoiled – it was ruined.  Kira says, “It spoils the fun wh en you already know what’s going to happen.  Where’s the suspense?”  “Suspe nse” is this feeling of anticipation or excitement before something happens.  Al fred Hitchcock was a famous movie director who made a lot of movies with suspe nse; you didn’t know what was going to happen next, or you were waiting for  it with excitement.

Lee says, “The blogs and reviews I read all have “spoiler a lerts” and I avoid reading those sections.”  A “spoiler alert” is when someon e tells you, usually on a website or in a newspaper article, that they are going  to give you information about the movie and how it ends, so if you don’t want to know that, you can stop reading right now.  So if a review says “spoiler alert, ” then don’t read any more because you’ll find out more about the movie, unless, of course, you don’t care about reading a spoiler.

So Lee says that he doesn’t read after he sees a spoiler a lert, but he also wants to tell Kira something else.  He says, “Let me just tell  you one thing I read,” and Kira says, “Stop right there!” meaning stop immediately.   “I’m covering my ears,” so she can’t hear.  “I want to stay in the dark, complete ly in the dark.”  “To stay in the dark” or “be in the dark” means not to know someth ing, not to be told something, to be ignorant.  “I was in the dark about why my girlfriend left me” – I didn’t know why; it was a mystery to me.  It’s always a myster y to me!  Well, Kira wants to stay in the dark, she doesn’t want to know anythin g more about the television show, and then she says to Lee, “Got it?”  “Go t it?” here is an informal

 expression asking if the person understands you: “Do you un derstand?  Am I clear?”

Lee says, “Okay, I won’t let the cat out of the bag.”  “T o let the cat out of the bag” means to accidentally tell someone a secret, to tell someo ne something that they’re not supposed to know.  “He let the cat out of  the bag when he told his son that he was going to get a new bicycle for his birthday.”   He didn’t mean to tell him, but he accidentally did – he let the cat out of the bag.  I’m not sure why the cat was in the bag; I would keep the cat in the bag if it were me, but that’s the expression.  Lee says, “we’re in for a wild ride this seaso n.”  “To be in for a wild ride” means we’re going to have a lot of fun or excite ment or surprises for a certain amount of time; many unexpected things are going  to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
