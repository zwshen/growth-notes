On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Jean and Gordon about using a light rail train. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jean: Look out!

Gordon: Don’t worry. That’s just a light rail train . The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.

Jean: Phew! For a second there I thought we were go ing to collide with it.

Gordon: Didn’t you see the operator seated at the f ront of the train? She watches out for other drivers.

Jean: I didn’t know they have operators. I thought they were automatic.

Gordon: No, they’re not like some forms of rapid tr ansit.

Jean: I see now that they ride on tracks and are po wered by overhead electric lines.

Gordon: That’s right.

Jean: I’d like to give light rail a try.

Gordon: Really? Well, there’s no time like the pres ent. I’ll take you to the nearest stop. There’s the platform over there.

 Jean: But I thought you agreed to give me a ride in to the city.

Gordon: And deprive you of a new travel experience?  Never!

Jean begins our dialogue by yelling to Gordon, spea king very loudly to Gordon, “Look out!” “Look out” is an expression we use to t ell someone they need to be careful – to warn someone that something perhaps bad is about to happen to them. In particular, something is about to hit them  or they are about to accidentally hit something and injure or hurt thems elves. Another way of saying “Look out!” is “Watch out!”

If you were standing next to a bookcase, a large pi ece of furniture that holds books, and the bookcase was about to fall on you, s omeone might yell, “Look out!” or “Watch out!” The person is warning you to look around and notice the danger that might affect you, and of course, to do something about it – to get out of the way, in this case. Gordon says to Jean, “Don ’t worry. That’s just a light rail train.” It appears that Gordon and Jean are driving  and Jean is telling Gordon, who is the person driving, to look out. Why? Becaus e apparently the car is near a light rail train.

A “light rail train” is a train that usually goes i nside of a city, from one part of a city to another. It might also go from two different cit ies. Light rail trains are not trains that go for long distances like, say, between Los A ngeles and New York City or between Paris and London. A light rail train  would  be a smaller train that’s usually used for what we might call “commuting.” He re in Southern California, we have a light rail train that goes from different su burbs of Los Angeles into the downtown area.

Gordon says, “The new light rail system shares the road with street traffic.” “Street traffic” refers to cars, trucks, and other vehicles that travel on the streets and roads. Buses, motorcycles, vans – these are all  examples of vehicles that use the streets. In some cities, the light rail tra in goes on the same street as the cars travel. In many cases, however, the light rail  train is on a different part of the street. The cars aren’t driving exactly on the same  part of the street as the light rail train, except perhaps when the street crosses another street.

Jean says, “Phew!” This is a word that we use to ex press relief, or perhaps when we’re really tired, we might go “Phew!” People pron ounce it differently, I think. It’s spelled (phew). Jean continues, “For a second there ,” meaning for a very brief

moment or brief time, “I thought we were going to c ollide with it.” “To collide (collide) with” something means to run into somethi ng. “The two cars collided with each other.” They hit each other. They ran int o each other.

Gordon says, “Didn’t you see the operator seated at  the front of the train? She watches out for other drivers.” The “operator” (ope rator) is the person who, in this case, drives a large vehicle or a train. The operat or of the train could also be called the “conductor.” The word “operator” is a mo re general term to describe a person who operates or controls a vehicle or machin e. “Conductor” specifically refers to the operator, if you will, of a train.

Gordon says the operator of this train “watches out  for other drivers.” “To watch out for” something means to look for possible probl ems so that you can avoid them. Someone may say to you, “If you visit Los Ang eles, watch out for crazy drivers” – people who don’t know how to drive and c ould cause an accident. I mentioned earlier that you can use “Watch out!” in some of the same situations as you would use “Look out!” You might also say “lo ok out for” in similar situations as you would use “to watch out for.” “Lo ok out for the dangerous drivers in Los Angeles, especially me.”

Jean says, “I didn’t know they have operators. I th ought they were automatic.” Something that is “automatic” (automatic) is someth ing that is controlled by a machine – often nowadays by a computer – not a “rea l live human being,” we might say. Jean is surprised that the train has the  actual human being operating it, running it, conducting it. Gordon says, “No, th ey’re not like some forms of rapid transit.”

“Transit” (transit) refers to moving something or a  group of people from one place to another. “Rapid” (rapid) means fast or quick. So , “rapid transit” refers to something that can move people from one place to an other quickly. Usually “rapid transit” is a kind of public transportation.  “Public transportation” refers to transportation or modes of transportation that anyo ne can use as long as he pays money. This would include buses, subways, light rai l trains, and so forth.

Jean says, “I see now that they” – meaning the trai ns, the light rail trains – “ride on tracks and are powered by overhead electric line s.” The “tracks” (tracks) of a train are the long metal pieces that the train sits  on and moves across. “To be powered by” something means to get the energy in or der to operate. Something that is powered by gasoline is something that gets its energy from some form of gasoline, usually gasoline that goes into a motor o r an engine.

The trains are powered by “overhead electric lines. ” Something that is “overhead” (overhead) is something that is above you, somethin g that is literally “over your head.” “Electric lines” are cables or long thin pie ces of metal that carry electricity. “Overhead electric lines” would be cables or lines that go above the train but that are connected to the train and allow the train to m ove. The electric lines carry electricity that power the train, that give it ener gy to move.

Gordon says, “That’s right,” meaning yes, Jean is c orrect. Jean says, “I’d like to give light rail a try.” “To give something a try” ( try) means to do something, usually something you have not done before. Gordon says, “Really? Well, there’s no time like the present.” The expression “There’s no time like the present” means that we should do something right away. We sh ouldn’t wait and do it later. He says, “I’ll take you to the nearest stop. There’ s a platform over there.”

A “stop” (stop) here refers to a station, or a plac e where a train or a bus regularly stops to let the people on the train or bus off and  to allow different people to come on. In most cities, there are “bus stops” ever y couple of blocks where the bus stops to allow you to get on and off. A “platfo rm” (platform) is a place where you get on a train. Specifically, “platforms” are u sed for trains, typically. We don’t talk about a “bus platform.” A “platform” is an are a that is usually above ground and higher than the ground around it. It allows you  to get on and off a train.

Jean says, “But I thought you agreed to give me a r ide into the city.” Jean is wondering why Gordon is telling her to get out of t he car and get on one of these light rail trains when he promised to give Jean a r ide into the city. Jean and Gordon are obviously not in the city but are going in that direction.

Gordon says, “And deprive you of a new travel exper ience? Never!” “To deprive” (deprive) someone of something is to not allow some one to have something or do something. Gordon doesn’t want to deprive, or pr event, Jean from having this new travel experience. We’re not so sure if Jean he rself wants that new travel experience right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
