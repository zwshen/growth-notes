<p>Some friends have the same hobby, they are collecting stamps. Once upon a
time they decided to make an exhibition. Exhibition brought them some money
and now they do not know how to divide their income. They decided to divide
their money according this rule: "The percent of whole income that i-th friend
will get is equal to the part of his unique stamp's type."</p>

<p>The stamp type is called unique if and only if this type of stamps of
owned only by one person.</p>

The first line contains integer K (0 &#60 K &#60= 100), it is number of tests. Each
test case is described by positive integer N (0 &#60 N &#60= 50), it`s the number
of friends. Next goes N lines with integers. Each line corresponds one friend
stamp collection. The first integer on the line is M - the number of stamps
owned by a person (0 &#60 M &#60= 50). Next goes M integers A (0 &#60= A &#60= 10000) - types
of stams.</p>
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case out line formatter like this: "<code>Case i: a<sub>1</sub>%
a<sub>2</sub>% a<sub>3</sub>% ... a<sub>n</sub>%</code>". Where "<code>i</code>"
is a test number, and "<code>a<sub>i</sub></code>" percent of income that goes
