[start of dialog]

Andy:  What did you do last weekend?

Yuka:  I went to Jamal’s wedding.

Andy:  Jamal?!  Your ex Jamal?

Yuka:  Yes, that Jamal.

Andy:  He had the nerve to invite you to his weddin g?

Yuka:  I actually thought it was nice of him to inv ite me.  Whatever happened between us years ago is water under the bridge.  Th ere are no hard feelings on either side.

Andy:  You told me that the breakup was mutual, but  I always thought you still had a soft place in your heart for him.

Yuka:  The truth is, when we first broke up, I did harbor some hopes of the two of us getting back together, but that never came to pa ss.  We both moved on and I wish him well.

Andy:  Well, how was the wedding?

Yuka:  It was very nice and Jamal’s new wife seems to be a good match for him.

Andy:  And you didn’t mind seeing them together?

Yuka:  Not at all, especially after I met Lorenzo.

Andy:  Lorenzo, huh?  You’ve been holding out on me .  Do tell!

Our dialog begins with Andy asking Yuka, “What did you do last weekend?” Yuka says, “I went to Jamal’s wedding.” A “wedding” is a n official ceremony where two people promise to, well it depends on the people, b ut typically, they promise to be married to each other until they die. That doesn ’t always happen. I understand. Yuka says that she went to Jamal’s wedd ing. Andy says, “Jamal?! Your ex Jamal?” “Ex” (ex) means my ex-boyfriend or my ex-girlfriend. It could also mean my ex-husband or my ex-wife. We just use the letters “ex” sometimes in informal conversation when we mean ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. Here, it’s Yuka’s ex-boyfriend.

Yuka says, “Yes, that Jamal,” meaning that’s the Ja mal I’m talking about. Andy is obviously surprised. Andy says, “He had the nerve to invite you to his wedding?” The expression “to have the nerve (nerve)” means to  do something very surprising, very surprising, but also very rude, ve ry unkind, and to do it without being sorry about it. We might also use the adjecti ves “bold” and “arrogant” when trying to define this expression. “You have the ner ve to tell me that my hair looks bad, when you’re bald yourself” – when you don’t ha ve any hair yourself? That’s what I said to somebody the other day. Well, Andy is surprised that Jamal had the nerve to invite Yuka to his wedding. “To invite ” means to ask someone to participate or to come to some sort of event.

Yuka says, “I actually thought it was nice of him to invite me.” So, Yuka was happy that her ex invited her. “Whatever happened b etween us years ago is water under the bridge.” Yuka is saying that no mat ter what happened, even if bad things happened many years ago, that is now all  “water under the bridge (bridge).” The expression “something is water under  the bridge” means something happened a long time ago but it’s no long er important and I’ve sort of forgotten about it, really. It’s not something that  bothers me anymore.

Maybe you and your brother had an argument and you’ re mad at each other for many months or even years. And then, you decide to forgive your brother or he forgives you or you forgive each other, and you for get about that thing that

happened. You say, “Oh, that’s water under the brid ge.” You can think about a river, of course, full of water and the water is al ways moving past. So, when you look down it’s not the same water that you would’ve  seen five seconds ago or five minutes or five days ago.

Yuka says “There are no hard feelings on either sid e.” “To have hard feelings” means to have anger or resentment about a situation  or a person. “No hard feelings” means that you’re not thinking about how this other person acted, or whether they may have insulted or hurt you. “No har d feelings” means I’m not mad at you. “Please don’t be mad at me” could also be a way of interpreting that expression. Yuka says “There are no hard feelings o n either side,” meaning neither she nor Jamal is angry at the other.

Andy says, “You told me that the breakup was mutual .” A “breakup” is when you end a romantic relationship, usually a boyfriend/gi rlfriend relationship. You could also use the term, however, for a marriage. “They b roke up their marriage.” They ended their marriage. They got a divorce. So, break up could be used in that case, too.

Andy says that Yuka told him that their breakup was  mutual. Something that is “mutual” (mutual) is something done by two people. You both agree. “The feeling is mutual” is another expression we have. That mean s “I feel the same about that person as that person feels about me.” It could be a positive thing. It could be a negative thing. “Mutual” just means something done by two people or done at the same time. Andy is saying that although Yuka told h im that their breakup was mutual, he always thought that Yuka still had a sof t place in her heart for him.

“To have a soft place in your heart for someone” me ans, really, that you still have kind feelings toward someone, possibly even romanti c feelings. It’s not always romantic. You could have a soft place in your heart  for your nephew or for your grandmother, but it might be also romantic in some instances, when you’re talking, of course, about situations where that’s l ikely.

Andy then thought that Yuka may have still liked Ja mal. Yuka says, “The truth is, when we first broke up, I did harbor some hopes of the two of us getting back together again.” “To harbor” (harbor) means to continue to have hop es about something or fears about something. It could be a positive or a negati ve, but to keep those feelings a secret from other people. Yuka had these hopes righ t after Jamal and she first broke up, “But that never came to pass,” she says. For something to “come to pass” means for something to happen. “Never come to  pass” means something did not happen, did not occur.

 Yuka says that she and Jamal both moved on. “To mov e on” means to continue with your life, not to worry about some past event or not to let it affect your decisions about what you’re doing right now. When t wo people breakup in a romantic relationship, it’s usually better for both  of them to move on, to find another boyfriend or another girlfriend, or a dog. Dogs sometimes can be much better companions, much better friends than a boyfr iend or a girlfriend.

Well, Yuka says that she and Jamal moved on and tha t she wishes him well. “To wish someone well” means to hope that that person h as a good life, to have good feelings towards that person, to want that person to be happy.

Andy says, “Well, how was the wedding?” Yuka said, “It was very nice and Jamal’s new wife seems to be a good match for him.”  “To be a match” (match) here means to have some of the same characteristics , some of the same interests that the other person has or simply to be  a good fit, to be two people that are good together, they’re good for each other . They’re a good match. Andy says, “And you didn’t mind seeing them together?” m eaning “It didn’t bother you to see your ex-boyfriend with his new wife?” Yuka s ays, “Not at all, especially after I met Lorenzo.”

Now we find out why Yuka is not angry about going to Jamal’s wedding, because she has a new boyfriend named Lorenzo. In English, Lorenzo is “Lawrence,” which some of you may know is my middle name, but I  am not dating Yuka. I want everyone to know that -  especially my wife!

Andy says, “Lorenzo, huh? You’ve been holding out o n me.” “To hold out on someone” is not to give that person all the informa tion that you have, to keep some things secret, not to tell the person everythi ng you know. Andy says, “Do tell.” This is a somewhat old-fashioned phrase, mea ning that you want the other person to give you the information, the (usually) e xciting or interesting news that they have to tell you. “Do tell” – “Please tell me”  is what that expression means.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
