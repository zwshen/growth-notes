On this episode, we’re going to talk about how you should act – how you should behave – at a formal event. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rodney: Ha-ha! Did you hear what I said? Funny, rig ht?

Samantha: Behave yourself! This is a serious and so lemn occasion, not a time for levity.

Rodney: Loosen up. We have to endure two hours of t his ceremony.

Samantha: It’s indecent the way you’re behaving. Do n’t you have any sense of decorum?

Rodney: Lighten up. You’re such a stick-in-the-mud.  There’s nothing unseemly about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is t aking themselves too seriously.

Samantha: Your problem is that you have no sense of  dignity. Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re  a disgrace.

Rodney: Don’t get all huffy. All right, if you won’ t join in, I’ll try to be serious.

Samantha: That’s better.

Rodney: I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!

Samantha: [Groans]

Rodney begins our dialogue by laughing, which we no rmally write as “Ha (ha) – ha (ha).” Rodney says, “Did you hear what I said? F unny, right?” meaning “Am I not right? Wasn’t it funny?” Samantha is not happy.  She says to Rodney, “Behave yourself.” When you tell someone to “behave ” (behave) himself or herself, you’re telling them to act in a way that w ould not bother other people, to act in a way that is what we would call “socially a cceptable.” So if you’re at a funeral, you’re not going to be going around laughi ng. If you’re at a wedding, you’re not going to go around crying. Those are not  socially acceptable behaviors in those situations.

You may also say this to a young child who is yelli ng or doing something that he shouldn’t be doing. You may say the child, “Behave yourself.” My mother used to say that to me a lot. Samantha continues, “This is a serious and solemn occasion, not a time for levity.” “Solemn” (solemn)  means serious, respectful – something that would describe a formal occasion abo ut something that was very serious. Samantha says, “This is not a time for lev ity” (levity). “Levity” is the opposite of solemn. “Levity” is related to humor, of making jokes about things.

Rodney doesn’t agree with Samantha. He says, “Loose n up.” This phrase “loosen (loosen) up” means be relaxed. Don’t be so serious. He says, “We have to endure two hours of this ceremony. “To endure” ( endure) means to tolerate or put up with something that is difficult or unpleasa nt – to suffer through something patiently. You can endure a difficult time in your life. You could endure watching a terrible movie for two hours with your wife becau se you love her and you told her that you would go and watch the movie with her – just an example. Rodney is talking about having to endure two hours of this ce remony. We’re not quite sure what the ceremony is for.

Samantha says, “It’s indecent the way you’re behavi ng.” “Indecent” (indecent) is the opposite of “decent.” “Decent” would be proper,  correct – something that is socially acceptable. “Indecent” would be something that is not correct, not appropriate for the situation. “Indecent” also has the meaning of being perhaps sexually inappropriate in a situation. Maybe tellin g jokes, for example, that are not appropriate.

Samantha says, “Don’t you have any sense of decorum ?” “Decorum” (decorum) refers to behavior that is considered socially acce ptable, especially in formal situations, in formal circumstances. Samantha is as king Rodney if he has any sense of decorum, meaning does he really even under stand what it means to

behave properly in a situation such as this. Once a gain, Rodney disagrees with Samantha’s opinion. He says to her something simila r that he said just a minute ago, “Lighten up.” “Lighten up” is the same as “loo sen up.” It means, again, to stop being so serious, stop being so sad, perhaps.

He says, “You’re such a stick-in-the-mud.” The phra se “stick-in-the-mud” refers to someone who isn’t very adventurous, someone who is dull, someone who is boring. Rodney continues, “There’s nothing unseemly  about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is taking themselves too seriou sly.” “Unseemly” (unseemly) again refers to behavior that is not appropriate for a certain setting, a certain situation, especially a formal one. Rodney says tha t he’s “cracking a few jokes.” “To crack (crack) a joke” is to tell a joke, to say  something that is funny.

Rodney says, “Everybody here,” wherever they are, “ is taking themselves too seriously.” “To take yourself too seriously” is to worry too much about how you appear to other people and to think that what you s ay and what you think are very important to everyone else. “To take yourself too seriously” is to think that you are more important to other people than you rea lly are. Samantha says, “Your problem is that you have no sense of dignity. ” Samantha is once again criticizing Rodney, saying he has no sense of “dign ity” (dignity). “Dignity” refers to having a serious manner, causing other people to lo ok at you with respect.

She continues, “Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re a disgrace.” “To cheapen” (cheapen) is to lo wer the quality of something, to cause something to be seen as worse than it real ly is. “To cheapen the occasion” would be to take a formal or serious situ ation and make it less serious, but also less respected. Samantha says to Rodney, “ You’re a disgrace.” If you call someone a “disgrace” (disgrace), you’re saying  that they are very bad because they have done something bad or unacceptabl e and you no longer respect them. You no longer think well of them.

Rodney isn’t all that interested in Samantha’s opin ion. He says, “Don’t get all huffy.” “To be huffy” (huffy) is to be annoyed, to be bothered, to be irritated. We would describe someone is being “huffy,” or “in a h uff,” when we don’t think they have a good reason to be angry and upset. It’s a cr iticism of someone to say something like, “Don’t get all huffy.” “Alright,” R odney says, “if you won’t join in, I’ll try to be serious,” meaning if you don’t want to have fun with me, I’ll try to be serious. Samantha says, “That’s better.” She’s happ y. Then Rodney says, “I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!”

And then Samantha “groans” – she makes a sound that  indicates that she’s really unhappy. Rodney says he’s going to be seriou s, but then he makes a joke

and says, “I would seriously like a drink.” Here, h e’s using the word “serious” to mean very much, or really. He’s not being serious i n the sense of being solemn or respectful. He’s using the adverb “seriously” to  mean really. Then he calls for the bartender, which is the person whose job it is to mix and serve you alcoholic drinks at a bar, or perhaps at some formal receptio n or ceremony where they have alcohol.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
