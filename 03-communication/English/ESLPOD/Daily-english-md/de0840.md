# Translating a Document

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 840: Translating a Document.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 840. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Our website is e slpod.com. Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog between Francine and Aziz about taking some documents, something that has been written, and tra nslating it into another language. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Francine:  Do you know the word in Mcquish for “par tnership”?

Aziz:  No, I don’t speak Mcquish. What are you doin g?

Francine:  Jim gave me this letter and this documen t to translate into Mcquish because I speak a little of it, but even with a dic tionary and thesaurus, it’s slow going.

Aziz:  Didn’t you tell Jim that?

Francine:  I did, but he still wants me to try beca use it’s so hard to find a Mcquish-English bilingual.

Aziz:  I’m not surprised. Other than you, I don’t k now anyone who speaks Mcquish.

Francine:  Yeah, well, I’m doing my best to transla te these documents idiomatically because the literal translation won’t  make any sense, but it’s a tough job. I simply don’t know enough business Mcquish to  know the equivalent words and phrases.

Aziz:  Can’t you just paraphrase and convey the gen eral meaning by using a lot of loan words and cognates?

Francine:  I’m trying, but I don’t think it’s turni ng out the way it’s supposed to.

Aziz:  At least he didn’t ask you to interpret. You ’d really be in the hot seat trying to interpret in a meeting or over the phone.

Francine:  Yeah, at least I was spared that experie nce, at least for now.

Aziz:  I wish I could help you, but the only langua ge I speak, other than English, is gibberish!

Francine begins by saying to Aziz, “Do you know the  word in McQuish for partnership?” “McQuish” is a very rare language. It ’s not spoken by more than, oh maybe a hundred people or so. You probably have never heard of it. Francine wants to know the word in McQuish for “partnership”  (partnership). A “partnership” is usually when two people decide to work together in a business, for example.

Aziz says, “No, I don’t speak McQuish. What are you  doing?” Francine says, “Jim gave me this letter and this document to translate into McQuish because I speak a little of it but even with a dictionary and a the saurus, it’s slow going. “ “To translate” means to take the words in one language and express them in another. What we’re trying to do is express the same idea. S ome people get confused, I think, that translation is taking a word in one lan guage and giving a similar sounding word in another. But it’s not about the wo rds, it’s about the ideas that you’re expressing.

Francine is trying to translate a letter and a docu ment – some other sort of piece of paper – into McQuish. But she says, “Even with a  dictionary and a thesaurus, it’s slow going.” A “dictionary” is a book that has  the meanings of words. You can have a bilingual dictionary, which gives the word in one language and a translation in another, or you can have a what we c ould call a “regular” dictionary that just has the words and the meanings all in the  same language. A “thesaurus” (thesaurus) is a book that lists groups of similar words, words that have similar meanings. It’s a book you use when you’re trying to  find a word that has a similar idea but you want to use something different. A “th esaurus” will help you find similar words. It’s not a definition of the word. I t’s a listing of words in that category. “To be slow going” means to be making ver y slow progress. It’s something that’s taking a lot of time, perhaps beca use it’s difficult to do. It’s slow going.

Aziz says, “Didn’t you tell Jim that?”  - “that” me aning that it’s slow going even with a dictionary and a thesaurus. Francine says, “ I did. But he still wants me to

try because it’s hard to find a McQuish-English bil ingual.” A “bilingual” (bilingual) is someone who speaks two languages. “Bi” (bi) is a  prefix that often means two. So, “bilingual” means two languages – someone who s peaks two languages. Someone who speaks three languages would be a “tril ingual” (trilingual). After that, we usually use a completely different word to  describe someone who speaks four or more languages. That word is “polygl ot” (polyglot). But Francine is talking about a McQuish-English bilingual – someone  who speaks McQuish and someone who speaks English. They should talk to me.

Aziz says, “I’m not surprised. Other than you, I do n’t know anyone who speaks McQuish.” Francine says, “Yeah. Well, I’m doing my best to translate these documents idiomatically, because the literal transl ation wouldn’t make any sense.” An “idiom” (idiom) in a language is a set of words that mean something different together than if you were just to look up  each individual word’s definition. So, for example, a “start up” could mean, if you ju st looked up the words in a dictionary, “start” meaning to begin, and “up” mean ing the opposite of down. But that isn’t in fact what “start up” means. A “start up,” as a noun, is a new company, often a new technology or Internet company, althoug h, the word is more generally used now to refer to any new company – ca n be a start up. Perhaps a better example would be a phrase like “It’s raining  cats and dogs.” This expression means it’s raining a lot. It’s raining a  great deal. It has nothing to do with cats and dogs falling down from the sky. It’s an idiomatic expression. The meaning of it is not something you can figure out f rom the individual words.

Well, “to translate a document idiomatically” means  to do so in a way that expresses the ideas in common phrases that are used  in that second or that language you are translating the document into. So,  idiomatic translations would be translations that express the idea, not just the  individual words. When you’re just taking each individual word and translating it , that would be what we would call a “literal translation.” “Literal” (literal) m eans the exact meaning for that one word but that one word by itself, not connected to any other words. A “literal translation isn’t, in my opinion, really a translat ion at all. A translation is taking the ideas from one language and expressing them in anot her. A “literal translation” is taking the idea of a word individually, without con sidering the other words in the sentence and translating that word which is really not a very useful thing to do. But, Francine is trying to translate the documents idiomatically. She says, “A literal translation won’t make any sense.” “To make  sense” means to be understandable, to be logical, to be rational. If y ou say, “It won’t make any sense,” you mean you won’t be able to understand it . She says this translation that she’s doing is a tough job. “I simply don’t kn ow enough business McQuish to know the equivalent words and phrases.” “Equivalent ” (equivalent) means equal to, the same as. Francine doesn’t know the right wo rds in McQuish – she says

“business McQuish” – for the words she knows and is  trying to translate in English.

Aziz says, “Can’t you just paraphrase and convey the general meaning by using a lot of loan words and cognates?” “To paraphrase” (paraphrase) means to express the same idea, the same general idea, but u sing different words. So, it’s not an exact translation. It’s sort of a summary of  the ideas. The verb “to convey,” (convey) means to express or to share some informat ion. “To convey the meaning” means to communicate the meaning. “To conv ey the general meaning” would be to be able to have the other person unders tand the meaning that you are trying to give them. A “loan (loan) word” is a word that is borrowed from another language. Sometimes it has a similar meanin g as it does in the language that you borrow it from. Sometimes it has a slightl y different meaning. In English, we use the French expression “Bon appétit” to mean have a good meal, enjoy your meal. A “cognate” (cognate) is a word that is similar to a word in another language. It has the same or similar sound or spell ing. So, there are some words, for example, in English and in Spanish, that are co gnates. They mean basically the same thing, but there are a lot of words that a re what we would call “false cognates.” They sound the same but they mean someth ing very different.

Francine says, “I’m trying but I don’t think it’s t urning out the way it’s supposed to.” I don’t think the result of doing this paraphr asing and using loan words and cognates is giving me the result we want. Aziz says , “At least he” – Jim – “didn’t ask you to interpret.” “To interpret” (interpret) m eans to translate while you are speaking. So, “translation” refers to taking the wr iting and putting it in another language. “Interpretation” means that the other per son is speaking and then you translate the meaning in your head and speak the se cond language.

So, if you go to the United Nations, for example, they have what are called “interpreters.” The interpreters interpret; they tr anslate orally. Aziz said that if Francine had to interpret, she’d really be in the h ot seat. “To be in the hot seat” (seat) means to be in a difficult situation, a situ ation that would give you a lot of problems. Francine says, “Yeah. At least I was spar ed that experience – at least for now.” “To be spared” (spared) means that you do n’t have to experience something, usually something bad, something unpleas ant. Someone might say, “I’ll spare you the details,” meaning I won’t give you all of the details because they are very painful to listen to or unpleasant to  hear. Aziz says, “I wish I could help you but the only language I speak – other than  English – is Gibberish.” “Gibberish” (gibberish) are words that don’t make a ny sense. They don’t have any meaning. They are just sounds that you say as t hough they were language but in fact, the words are just nonsense [speaks gi bberish] – that’s gibberish. It doesn’t mean anything. Most of what I say is gibber ish, I think.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

 There’s no gibberish in our dialogs. That’s because  they’re written by the one, the only, Dr. Lucy Tse.
