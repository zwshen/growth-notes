This episode is a dialog between Christine and Saul , about donating a part of your body to someone else. Let’s get started! 

[start of dialog] 

Christine:  What is this sticker on your driver’s l icense? 

Saul:  This sticker?  It indicates that I’ve signed  up for the organ donation program.  If anything bad happens to me, I want my organs to go to recipients who need them. 

Christine:  You mean you want somebody else to have  your heart, liver... 

Saul:  ...eyes, kidneys, or anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.  Don’t you want to donate your organs? 

Christine:  Me?  No way.  I’ll never consent to doc tors cutting up my body after I die.  Those organs are a part of me. 

Saul:  But you won’t need them when you’re dead, an d there are long waiting lists at eye banks and organ registries. Your organ  donation might be the difference between life and death for somebody, you  know. 

Christine:  That might be true, but I can’t imagine  somebody else walking around with my brain. 

Saul:  Hmm, come to think of it, me neither. 

[end of dialog]  

 Our dialog begins with Christine asking Saul, “What  is this sticker on your driver’s license?” A “sticker” (sticker) is a small piece of  paper, usually with a word or a picture on it that you put on something and it stic ks to it. The verb “to stick” means to adhere, to stay on something so that it wo n’t come off. A sticker is used, for example, on the back of your car. You can  put a, what we would call a “bumper sticker” on the back of your car. Basically , it’s a piece of paper with a little bit of glue or some sort of substance on the  back that will allow it to be placed on another object.  

Saul has a sticker on his driver’s license. A “driv er’s license” is usually a small plastic card with your name and your picture on it that shows that you have permission to drive in a certain state. Each state has its own driver’s license in the United States but if you have a driver’s licens e from one state, you can drive in any state.  

Saul says, “This sticker? It indicates that I’ve si gned up for the organ donation program.” Saul says the sticker “indicates,” meanin g it shows. It makes something clear. It makes something understood. It indicates that I’ve signed up; that is, I’ve become a member of the organ donation  program. An “organ” (organ) is a part of your body like your lungs, your kidney , your heart, your pancreas – all of these would be organs in your body. They’re part s of your body. “Donation” means a gift – to give something to someone. The ve rb is “to donate” (donate). “Organ donation,” then, is when you give a part of your body to another person. You can do this while you are living. For example, you can donate a kidney to someone because most people are born with two kidne ys and so, you can give one to someone else. It might be something that hap pens after you die. You may donate part of your body to someone else who is liv ing because after all, if you’re dead, you don’t need your organs anymore, probably.   

Saul says that “If anything bad happens to me” – th at is, if he gets injured or killed – “I want my organs to go to recipients who need them.” A “recipient” (recipient) is someone who receives something. Some one who is given something is a recipient. We might talk about someo ne being a recipient of an award. “He was a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize .” “He was a recipient of an Oscar Award.”  

You can also be a recipient, in this case, of an or gan. Christine says, “You mean you want somebody else to have your heart, liver” –  she starts naming some of the organs. Your heart, you probably know, is the o rgan in your chest that pumps or moves blood throughout the body. Your “liver” (l iver) is something near your stomach that filters blood as it goes through your body. Saul says, “… eyes,  

kidneys and anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.” Your kidney, as I mentioned earlier, is something that y ou actually have two of. You have two kidneys and it also is involved in filteri ng your blood. I’m not a doctor – not a real doctor – so I don’t have a good explanat ion for what all the organs do. But you studied biology, right? You know what organ s are.  

Saul wants his organs to be transplanted into someo ne else. “To transplant” means to move something from one place to another. We talk about organ transplants. The verb is “to transplant.” You can a lso talk about transplanting plants, trees, people – those things can all be tra nsplanted, moved from one place to another.  

Saul then asks Christine, “Don’t you want to donate  your organs?” Christine says, “Me? No way!” – absolutely not, she says. “I’ ll never consent to doctors cutting up my body after I die.” “To consent” (cons ent) means to agree to do something. Someone says, “I will not consent to tha t,” meaning I will not agree to that. I will not say “yes” to that. Christine says she’ll never consent to doctors cutting up her body after she dies. “To cut up” mea ns to cut into, to open up your skin and take things from the inside of your body.  

Christine says, “Those organs are part of me.” Saul  says, “But you won’t need them when you’re dead and there are long waiting li sts at eye banks and organ registries.” A “waiting list” is a long list of peo ple who want something but there isn’t enough of that something. So they have to wai t for it. You can have a waiting list for all sorts of things. At our colleg es and universities, sometimes there aren’t enough spaces in the classroom, and so  some courses have waiting lists.  You have to wait and hope that there will b e room in the class for you.  

Many people need organs and so, there are waiting l ists for organ transplants. One kind of place where people put their name down,  we might say – where they join a waiting list – is an eye bank. An “eye bank”  (bank) is a place that stores what are called “corneas,” parts of an eye  that ar e taken from the bodies of people who have died. And they use these to help pe ople who are living see better. An “organ registry” (registry) is an offici al list of people waiting for organs. A “registry” is any sort of official list or record . We also use this term when we are talking about legal matters. We might talk about an  official registry with the government – an official list of people. 

Saul says, “Your organ donation might be the differ ence between life and death for somebody.” The phrase “the difference between l ife and death” here means that something is so important, it could decide whe ther someone lives or dies. It  

is something that very important. Here, we’re talki ng about a case where someone could actually die if they did not get an o rgan.  

However, the expression is also used in cases where  we’re trying to say something is extremely or very important. A related  expression is a “matter (matter) of life and death,” which means the same t hing. However, I should point out that the original expression, back before the 1 9th  century anyway, was “a matter of life or  death,” which makes more sense. Either you live or  you die. You can’t live and  die. It can’t be life “and” death. It has to be li fe “or” death. However, most people use the expression “life and death.” Yo u will still hear the original expression but they both mean the same thing.  

Christine says, “That might be true.” It might be t rue that it’s a matter of life and or death. “But I can’t imagine somebody else walkin g around with my brain.” Your brain is the organ in your head. Most people have a  brain. I know some people who I don’t think have brains, but most people have  brains. My neighbor? Hmm…  

Saul says, “Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.” So, Christine is worried that they might transplant her brain into someone else. And, of course, as of 2012, we don’t transplant people’s brains. But Saul agrees w ith Christine. He doesn’t think Christine is very smart, and so he says “Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.” The expression “come to think of it” is used to mea n that you’ve thought about something and you now have a different opinion or a  new understanding about something. “Me neither” is a slightly ungrammatical  way of saying “Neither do I.” In common conversation however, people don’t say, t ypically, “Neither do I.” They’ll say something like, “Me neither,” even thou gh “me” is not a subject pronoun. It should be “I” but we say it anyway. Sau l is saying, “I don’t think anyone would want your brain either, Christine, bec ause you’re stupid.” That’s really what Saul is saying, isn’t he? 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed. 

[start of dialog] 

Christine:  What is this sticker on your driver’s l icense? 

Saul:  This sticker?  It indicates that I’ve signed  up for the organ donation program.  If anything bad happens to me, I want my organs to go to recipients who need them. 

Christine:  You mean you want somebody else to have  your heart, liver...  

 Saul:  ...eyes, kidneys, or anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.  Don’t you want to donate your organs? 

Christine:  Me?  No way.  I’ll never consent to doc tors cutting up my body after I die.  Those organs are a part of me. 

Saul:  But you won’t need them when you’re dead, an d there are long waiting lists at eye banks and organ registries. Your organ  donation might be the difference between life and death for somebody, you  know. 

Christine:  That might be true, but I can’t imagine  somebody else walking around with my brain. 

Saul:  Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.
