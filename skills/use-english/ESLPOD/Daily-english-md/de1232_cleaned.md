This episode is a dialogue between Larry and Anat a bout intimidating a coworker – making a coworker feel fearful or somehow afraid.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Larry: How’s it going? You having fun? 

Anat: You know full well that this is out of my are a of expertise, but I’m coping. 

Larry: Is that what you’re doing? It looks to me li ke you’re making a mess of things. 

Anat: Cut me some slack. I’ve only been working on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed. 

Larry: You know what I think? 

Anat: No and I don’t care. 

Larry: I think you’re in over your head. Why don’t you step aside and let someone competent do the job. 

Anat: No amount of heckling or trash talking will m ake me quit. I’m here for the long haul. 

Larry: We’ll see about that. People more qualified than you are have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done aroun d here. 

Anat: Talk all you like, but no amount of intimidat ion will get you what you want. 

Larry: And you know what I want? 

Anat: I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs, but it’ll be a cold day in hell before that happens.

Larry begins our dialogue by asking Anat, “How’s it  going?” meaning “How are you doing? How are things going?” “You having fun?”  Larry says, meaning “Are you having fun?” Anat says, “You know full well tha t this is out of my area of expertise, but I’m coping.”  

The expression “you know full well” is used when so meone pretends they don’t know or understand something, when someone says the y don’t understand something, but they really do. It might also be use d if you are just confused about why someone is saying something. For example, your wife may say, “Let’s go to the baseball game.” You look at her and you don’t u nderstand why she’s saying that. You may say to her, “You know full well that you don’t like baseball. So why do you want to go?” You’re confused in that case.  

Anat isn’t confused. She knows that Larry knows tha t whatever she’s working on is out of her “area of expertise” (expertise). Your  “area of expertise” is something you know a lot about, something that you have a lot  of knowledge of. “Expertise” is related to the word “expert.” An “expert” is som eone who knows a lot about a certain topic. This thing that Anat is working on i s out of her area of expertise, meaning she is not an expert.  

She says she’s “coping.” The verb “to cope” (cope) means to manage a difficult or challenging situation, especially when you’re no t very good at what you are trying to do or you don’t have the necessary tools or resources to do something. When you are placed in a very difficult or challeng ing situation, sometimes you don’t have the experience or knowledge or resources  – that is, things you can use to help you handle the situation. So you have “ to cope” the best you can. You have to manage the situation the best that you are able.  

Larry says, “Is that what you’re doing?” He’s surpr ised that Anat thinks that she’s coping (meaning she’s doing okay but not very well) . Larry doesn’t even think she’s doing okay. He says, “It looks to me,” meanin g it seems to me, “like you’re making a mess of things.” “To make a mess (mess) of  things” means to create a lot of problems by doing things wrong, by doing thi ngs incorrectly.  

Anat says back to Larry, “Cut me some slack” (slack ). The expression “to cut someone some slack” is used informally to mean to m ake something easier for another person by not being as hard on them or by n ot trying to give someone a hard time. If you give someone a job, a task, and t he person isn’t doing very well at it, you might decide to give the person more tim e. This would be one way of “cutting the person some slack.”  

We also use this expression when someone is giving you a hard time, when someone is criticizing you. You might say to the pe rson criticizing you, “Cut me some slack,” meaning stop being so hard on me, stop  criticizing me. That’s the sense that Anat uses this expression here in the di alogue. She’s asking Larry to stop criticizing her. She says, “I’ve only been wor king on this for a day and it’ll take me a little time to get up to speed.”  

The expression “to get up to speed” means to learn something quickly, to get the knowledge and skill that other people have in order  to do a certain task. If everyone else knows how to do something and you don ’t, you will need “to get up to speed.” You will need to know as much as everyon e else does, to learn what everyone else already knows. Larry says to Anat, “Y ou know what I think?” meaning “Do you know what I think?” Anat says, “No and I don’t care,” meaning “I don’t care what you think, Larry.”  

Larry, nevertheless, gives his opinion. He says, “I  think you’re in over your head.” The expression “to be in over your head” means to b e trying to do something that’s too difficult for you – to, we would say, “b e overwhelmed” (overwhelmed). “To be overwhelmed” or “to be in over your head” me ans that you are trying to do something that is too hard for you.  

Larry says, “Why don’t you step aside and let someo ne competent do the job.” “To step aside” (aside) is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop doing something so someone else can do it in your place. “To step aside” can sometimes mean to literally move to one side if som eone is trying to get by you or if someone is trying to do what you are doing be cause you aren’t doing a very good job at it. “To be competent” (competent) means  to be able to do something well, to have the knowledge or skills to do somethi ng.  

Larry doesn’t think Anat is competent to do the tas k she’s doing, but Anat responds, “No amount of heckling or trash talking w ill make me quit.” “To heckle” (heckle) means to interrupt what someone is doing b y yelling at them or saying mean things to them. We usually use this verb when someone is giving a speech, or if a comedian is telling jokes and someo ne doesn’t like the speaker or the comedian and so the person yells out insulting things at that person to get the  

person angry or simply to interrupt the person. Tha t’s called “heckling.” “A person in the crowd heckled the speaker.”  

“To trash (trash) talk” is to say mean things to an other person – insulting things – especially someone against whom you are competing, say, in a game or a sporting event. “To trash talk” means to criticize the performance or abilities of another person. Anat says that she’s not going to q uit just because Larry is “heckling” her or “trash talking.” She says, “I’m h ere for the long haul” (haul). To be somewhere “for the long haul” means for a long t ime, until the job is done – someone who’s going to do something, even if it’s d ifficult, until it’s completed.  

Larry says, “We’ll see about that.” That expression , “We’ll see (see) about that” is used when you don’t agree with someone else’s predi ction, when you don’t agree that what the person is saying is going to be  correct. You think the person is wrong and you are right. “People more qualified than you have packed it in after they got a taste of how things are done aroun d here,” Larry says. “To pack (pack) it in” is an expression meaning to give up, to stop doing what you are doing. “To get a taste of things” means to experien ce something in a small amount so you have a basic understanding of it.  

Larry is saying to Anat that once she realizes how things are done in this particular job, she’s going “to pack it in,” becaus e other people who are more qualified, who have more skills than Anat, have qui t after they had “gotten a taste of how things are done.” Anat says, “Talk all you l ike,” meaning you can continue criticizing me and talking, “but no amount of intim idation will get you what you want.”  

“Intimidation” (intimidation) is a feeling of fear because you believe someone else is better than you, or stronger than you, or more p owerful than you. The verb is “to intimidate.” So, “intimidation” is a state of b eing intimidated. Anat says she’s not going to be intimidated. She will not feel fear  based on what Larry has been saying. She thinks Larry is trying to intimidate he r to get what he wants.  

Larry says, “And you know what I want?” Anat says, “I think so. You’d like me to go away with my tail between my legs.” The expressi on “with your tail (tail) between your legs” means to feel embarrassed or hum iliated, to feel like a failure. You can think of a dog who is scared, or p erhaps afraid of something, running away with its tail between its legs. That i ndicates, at least we think, that the dog is somehow afraid of something. Anat says s he’s not going to go away with her tail between her legs, feeling humiliated or powerless.  

She says, in fact, “It’ll be a cold day in hell bef ore that happens.” The expression “it will be a cold day in hell” is used to show tha t something is impossible, that something will never happen. We think of hell as be ing a hot place – traditionally, anyway – so it could never be cold in hell, and the refore that is impossible. So, if you say, “It will be a cold day in hell before (wha tever it is you think won’t happen),” you’re saying that that thing is impossib le, just as it would be impossible for it to be cold in a hot place like he ll.  

There’s another related expression, “You have a sno wball’s chance in hell.” A “snowball” (snowball) is, of course, a little ball made out of snow, which is cold. Once again, it’s the same idea. There are no snowba lls in hell because hell is a hot place, therefore what you are saying or predict ing is impossible.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
