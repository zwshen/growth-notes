This episode is a dialogue between Ricardo and Mars ha about a place that is difficult to find.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ricardo:  I’m making one more pass and if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m heading back into town.  I’m tired and I want a sho wer.

Marsha:  I’m sure we’ll find it.  When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees and to keep an eye out for their white sign.

Ricardo:  Did she say blink and you’ll miss it?  Be cause we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t see a sign.

Marsha:  She just said that they’re a little off the beaten path.

Ricardo:  If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?

Marsha:  That’s part of the charm of a small hotel hideaway.  It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the touris t areas.

Ricardo:  That’s all good and fine, but we have to find it first.  Okay, this is the last pass.  Keep your eyes peeled.

Marsha:  There it is!  I’ve spotted the sign.  It’s  over there, see?

Ricardo:  Yeah, now I see it.  Geez, it’s like find ing a needle in a haystack!

[end of dialogue]

Ricardo begins by saying, “I’m making one more pass .”  “To make one more pass” means to try to do something one more time, e specially in this case where Ricardo is driving and he’s trying to find a specif ic place and perhaps he’s driven down this road once or more than once, he’s going t o try it one more time.  He says, “if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m he ading back into town.”  “To head back” is a phrasal verb meaning to begin to go back  to the place from which you came, to return to where you were before.  In this case, Ricardo is going to head back to into town.  Here, the word “town” means any  urban area; could be a city, it could be a small town.  The general expression “ to go into town” usually means to go to the busier part of a city or into a city.

Ricardo says, “I’m tired and I want a shower.”  Mar sha says, “I’m sure we’ll find it. When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees.”  The “desk clerk” is the person who an swers the phone for a business or an office; we might also call the desk clerk a “receptionist.”  Marsha says that the desk clerk told her that the hotel is  hidden away.  “To be hidden (hidden) away” means that you cannot easily see som ething, usually because it is behind something else.  In this case, the hotel is behind some trees so you can’t see it from the street – from the road.  The desk clerk also told Marsha to keep an eye out for the white sign that the hotel h as.  The expression “to keep an eye out” is very common; it means to look for somet hing, to be aware of the things around you.  You might say to your husband, “When you go to the grocery store, keep an eye out for any sales,” anything tha t is being sold at a discounted or lower price.  To keep an eye out, then, means to  be looking for something.

Ricardo says, “Did she say blink and you’ll miss it ?”  Ricardo is trying to be funny here.  This is an old expression, “blink and you’ll  (or you will) miss it.”  “To blink” means to open and close your eyelids; you do this a utomatically.  The idea is that it happens very quickly.  So when someone says, “bl ink and you’ll miss it,” they mean that if you’re not looking carefully you will go right by it; you will miss it; you will not see it perhaps because it is well hidden, or perhaps because it is very small, or perhaps it relates to an event that will happen quickly.  Ricardo is saying that it must be a place that is very difficult to f ind.  He says, “Because we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t se e a sign.”  “Stretch” here refers to a certain part or a certain section of a road, b etween one point and another.  It could be three blocks, it could be a half a mile, i t could be five kilometers; it’s a somewhat vague, unspecific term to refer to a part of a street or a road.  In this case, Ricardo is referring to the part of the road where the hotel is supposed to be, and they still are unable to find it.

Marsha says, “She just said that they’re a little o ff the beaten path.”  “A little” here means slightly, a little bit.  “To be off the beate n path” means to be in a place that is not normally visited by a lot of people; it’s no t downtown, it’s not where there are a lot of tourists.

Ricardo says, “If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?”  “Pr ominent” here means to be seen easily because it’s very large or perhaps diff erent.  Some buildings have special signs or things that they put on the buildi ng so you can find them easily when you’re driving down the street.  McDonald’s, t he hamburger restaurant, has a big yellow “m” that makes the restaurant more pro minent; you see that; you know what that means; you can find it easily becaus e of it.  Ricardo says that they should make their hotel more prominent with so me kind of “landmark.”  Here he’s using the term, I think, to mean some physical  change in the building, some thing that they would add to the building, perhaps a big flagpole with a flag or something that they could tell people to look for t hat would indicate that their hotel was there.  We also use the term “landmark” t o refer to important buildings or statues, but here it’s used more generally to me an simply something physical that will help you find the location.

Marsha says, “That’s part of the charm of a small h otel hideaway.”  “Charm” here means things that are likable, especially in a some what and perhaps old- fashioned way, the way things used to be many years  ago.  When someone says, “Oh, this is charming,” they mean it’s nice, it’s pleasant, it’s calming perhaps.  “Charm” is also used to describe a person ality characteristic.  When you say, “That man was very charming,” we mean he w as very nice; he was very likable.  Marsha says that this is one of the charm s of a small hotel hideaway. “Hideaway” (hideaway – one word) is a place where y ou can go that you will not be interrupted by other people, a place where you c an be by yourself so that no one will bother you or find you.  Marsha says, “It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the tourist areas.”  A “neon ( neon) sign” is a large sign where the words and images are in special lights.  You put a special kind of gas – neon gas into these tubes that act like light bul bs and form the sign.  Neon signs were very popular back in the 50s and 60s and  70s, and still today in some places.  Las Vegas is famous for its neon signs, so  is Sunset Boulevard here in Los Angeles, and, of course, Broadway in New York C ity.  Anyway, Marsha says that this hotel does not have neon signs, “it’s tuc ked away far from the tourist areas.”  “To be tucked away” means to be far away f rom other people, other buildings, from where the rest of the people are; i n this case, away from the tourist areas, places where visitors would go.

Ricardo says, “That’s all good and fine (meaning we ll, that’s nice), but we have to find it first.  Okay,” he says, “this is the last p ass,” the last time he’s going to drive down this stretch of road.  “Keep your eyes peeled, ” he says.  “To keep your eyes peeled” (peeled) means to look for something v ery carefully, especially when you know it is difficult to find.  So, it’s si milar to “keep an eye out,” but it requires even more concentration; you have to reall y be looking for it because you know it’s difficult to find.

Marsha says, “There it is!  I’ve spotted (or seen) the sign.  It’s over there, see?” Ricardo says, “Yeah, now I see it.  Geez, it’s like  finding a needle in a haystack!” “Geez,” spelled usually (geez), is an expression of  surprise or relief or some sort of uncertainty.  In this case, it’s more relief tha n anything else.  Someone says, “Oh, geez!  Where did I put my keys?” you’re confus ed; you’re lost.  Or someone may say, “Oh, geez!  You scared me when you walked up without knocking on my door.”  So, it can be used in a lot of different  cases.  Ricardo says finding this hotel is like finding a needle in a haystack.  A “n eedle” is a small, sharp pin that is used for sewing things together, putting together t wo pieces of fabric for clothing, for example.  A “haystack” is made of hay – “hay” i s basically dried grass – that is put together and used on a farm.  The idea of a nee dle in a haystack is that it’s very difficult to find.  It would be very difficult  to find any sort of small object that was hidden in a large area, that’s the idea of find ing a needle in a haystack.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
