On this episode, we listen to a dialogue between Ar mand and Suzanne about assembling, or putting together, furniture. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Armand: Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?

Suzanne: The box said that it required simple assem bly. I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.

Armand: You can say that again. These instructions aren’t in English, there are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and  we seem to be missing parts. I also question the quality. It’s mainly mad e of particleboard and plywood. Do you think we should return it?

Suzanne: No, let’s just keep it and do the best we can.

Armand: That’s hard to do when there seems to be a design flaw with the drawers. The pieces don’t fit together as they shou ld. These nails are also bent and these screws look defective.

Suzanne: It’s not looking good, is it? I also bough t this because I thought everything could be assembled using Allen wrenches,  but it looks like we’ll actually need a hammer, screwdriver, and maybe a dr ill.

Armand: Well, let’s see what we can do. If we don’t  have the right tools or parts, I have a solution.

Suzanne: What?

Armand: Duct tape.

Armand begins our dialogue by asking Suzanne, “Did you know that this nightstand required assembly when you bought it?” A  “nightstand” (nightstand) – one word – is a small table that you put next to yo ur bed, usually to put a lamp, a clock, and perhaps a glass of water on. A nightstan d usually also has what we call “drawers” – little boxes that pull out from the table that you can put things in and then slide back into the table.

Armand is asking Suzanne if she knew before she bou ght it “that this nightstand required assembly.” “Assembly” (assembly) is the no un form of the verb “to assemble” (assemble). “To assemble” means to put so mething together – to take individual pieces and to put them together to make something else. Nowadays it’s popular for some stores to sell furniture (thi ngs you put in your house such as tables, chairs, and perhaps nightstands) “unassembl ed” – that is, they’re not put together. You have to basically build or put the pi ece of furniture together yourself.

One popular store here in the U.S. and in many othe r countries is IKEA, a Swedish company. You can buy furniture, but usually  you have to assemble it yourself. And boy, if you’ve ever assembled somethi ng from IKEA, you know it’s not as easy as it looks. It’s not as easy as it app ears. Anyway, Armand is not very happy, I think, with Suzanne, because he has t o assemble this nightstand.

Suzanne says, “The box said” (the cardboard contain er that it came in is called a box) “that it required simple assembly.” “Simple as sembly” would be not very complicated – maybe three or four pieces, say. She continues, “I guess what’s simple to them isn’t simple to us.” The company thi nks it’s simple, but you don’t think it’s simple. Armand says, “You can say that a gain.” That expression “You can say that again” is when someone says something that you agree with and you want to emphasize that you really agree with th at person.

Armand says, “These instructions aren’t in English.  There are no diagrams showing how the parts fit together, and we seem to be missing parts.” So, the instructions – the information that tells you how t o assemble the furniture – aren’t in English for this particular nightstand, accordin g to Armand. He also says there are “no diagrams showing how the parts fit together .” A “diagram” (diagram) is a

drawing that shows you how something works or how s omething should be put together.

“To fit together” means to be placed next to each o ther and joined so that they are connected. If you are assembling a table, the l egs would fit together with the table top. They would be connected to each other. H owever, Armand says that they “seem to be missing parts.” A “part” (part) he re is a piece – in this case, a piece of the nightstand. “I also question the quali ty,” Armand says. “To question” here means to doubt, or to have doubts about someth ing.

Armand says, “It’s mainly made of particleboard and  plywood.” “Particleboard” is a cheap, inexpensive material made by compressing, or putting together, many smaller pieces of wood. Sometimes companies sell fu rniture made of particleboard because it’s cheaper. Another cheap f orm of wood is called “plywood” (plywood). Plywood is a wooden board made  from layers of wood that are glued together – they’re stuck together. Plywoo d is usually very thin.

Some people use plywood on the walls. They put the plywood up, up on the walls. This was very popular in the 1960s, in the 1 970s. Instead of painting your wall or putting wallpaper on it, you could put piec es of wood on it called plywood. My house where I grew up had plywood in several of the rooms because my father didn’t want to paint the rooms every couple of years. So, we had this brown plywood on the walls. It was quite normal dur ing the 1970s, or at least it was in the neighborhood where I grew up.

Armand asks Suzanne if perhaps they should “return”  this nightstand, meaning bring it back to the store and get their money back . Suzanne says, “No, let’s just keep it and do the best we can.” Armand says, “That ’s hard to do when there seems to be a design flaw with the drawers.” A “des ign (design) flaw (flaw)” is a mistake in the way that something was conceived or created. It’s a mistake in the basic idea behind, in this case, the nightstand. Ar mand says there’s a design flaw with the drawers of the nightstand. “The pieces don ’t fit together as they should,” he says.

“These nails are also bent and these screws look de fective,” says Armand. “Nails” (nails) are straight long pieces of metal w ith pointed ends that you use to put two things together. I say they’re long, but I mean really they’re perhaps between a quarter of an inch and an inch or two inc hes. “Nails” are used usually to put together pieces of wood, although you can us e a nail to connect or to join two other kinds of material as well. Armand says th at the nails that came with this nightstand are “bent” (bent). “Bent” here means not  straight. Another word we would use is “crooked” (crooked).

 Armand also says, “These screws look defective.” A “screw” (screw) here means a long piece of metal, about the size of a nail, th at has a spiral pattern around it. A screw is not pounded in with a hammer as you woul d a nail. A screw is put into a piece of wood or a piece of metal using something  called a “screwdriver.” It turns in order to go into the material. You don’t h it it. You turn it with a screwdriver. “Defective” (defective) means it doesn ’t work properly. It has a problem.

Suzanne says, “It’s not looking good, is it?” meani ng it doesn’t look like this nightstand is going to be one that they want to kee p. She says, “I also bought this because I thought everything could be assembled usi ng Allen wrenches.” An “Allen wrench” (wrench) is a small tool that is in the shape of the letter L. It’s a metal tool that has a six-sided shape at the end of  it, what we call a “hexagon,” and it’s used to turn special kinds of screws that require this special kind of wrench. The screws themselves have a hole that is s ix-sided.

Suzanne says, “It looks like we actually need a ham mer, screwdriver, and maybe a drill. A “hammer” (hammer) is a heavy tool that y ou use to pound nails into a piece of wood or other material. A “screwdriver” is  a long piece of metal that is used to twist or turn screws so that the screw goes  into the material. A “drill” (drill) is an electric tool that is often used inst ead of a screwdriver to put material into a piece of wood or metal.

Armand says, “Well, let’s see what we can do. If we  don’t have the right tools or parts, I have a solution.” Suzanne says, “What?” Ar mand says, “Duct tape.” “Duct tape” (duct tape) is a very strong, thick tap e that is usually grey in color and nowadays is used to connect two different things to gether that perhaps are broken or that you don’t have another way of connec ting or keeping together.

People use duct tape nowadays all the time to cover  a hole in something or to fix something that has broken. It’s a very strong tape that can be quite useful when something breaks or when you don’t have a way of bi nding two things together with normal tape.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
