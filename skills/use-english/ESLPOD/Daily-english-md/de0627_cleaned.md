This episode is called “Being Spontaneous or Well-Planne d.”  These are opposite things, as we will learn from Mariela and Wil l.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Mariela:  Wow, it looks like you’re working on a big pro ject.  What are all these pages and pages of notes for? 

Will:  I’m preparing for my date with Christine.  I w ant everything to be well- planned and to go without a hitch. 

Mariela:  Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re  making such detailed plans. 

Will:  I want to be ready for every contingency.  For in stance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden  Café instead. 

Mariela:  Don’t you think you’re taking the spontaneity o ut of your date?  Why don’t you play it by ear?  I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pants, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do. 

Will:  Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into account.  If sh e wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.  If she p refers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.   

Mariela:  Well, it sounds like you’ve mapped out every possi ble alternative.  Hey, what’s this? 

Will:  Give me that!  

 Mariela:  I see you’ve mapped out more than just your d ate.  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your life together: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that… 

Will:  That is not meant for you.  And plus, it’s just a tentative plan… 

Mariela:  You mean Christine will have some say in it?   

Will:  I may let her pick our children’s names.  Now, get  out of here, will ya?! 

[end of dialogue] 

Mariela begins by saying, “Wow, it looks like you’re workin g on a big project (a large task).  What are all these pages and pages of not es for?”  “Notes” is information that you write down sort of informally whe n you are thinking about an idea or are listening to someone.  We use the expression “to take notes,” for example at a meeting somebody takes notes – somebody writes down everything that is discussed and decided.  Or a student can  take notes in school, writing down what the teacher or professor says.   

Well, Mariela sees pages and pages, which is a way of sayin g a lot of pages of notes, and wants to know what they are for – why does he have them?  Will says, “I’m preparing for my date with Christine.”  A “da te” is, of course, a romantic appointment where you meet someone you are romanticall y interested in.  He says, “I want everything to be well-planned and to go wi thout a hitch.”  “To be well-planned” means you know exactly what’s going to happe n sometime in the future.  You know what you’re going to do first, second,  and third.  Most people don’t think about romantic dates as being well-planned.   Planned perhaps, you have an idea, but well-planned gives the idea that it’ s almost going to be a schedule that you will follow.  But Will says he wants his date to go without a hitch (hitch).  “Without a hitch” means without any pro blems, without any difficulties. 

Mariela says, “Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re  making such detailed plans,” plans that include exactly everything that is going  to happen.  Will says, “I want to be ready for every contingency.”  A “contingency”  is something that might happen in the future and could change your plans because it causes problems or difficulties.  So if you have a contingency for rain when  you are planning, say, a party outside, that means that if it rains you have somet hing you’re going to do to prevent the party from being cancelled.  Perhaps you are going to move  

 everyone into your garage or inside of your house or insid e of your neighbor’s house – you probably should ask them first!  That’s a conti ngency, a plan for something that might go wrong in the future.  Will sa ys, “For instance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden Café instead.”  See, if it rains he has a plan about what he’s going to do instead  of the original plan. 

Mariela says, “Don’t you think you’re taking the spontane ity out of your date?” “Spontaneity” (spontaneity) is the opposite of well-pl anned; it’s doing things without planning them first, just doing them right at  that moment.  Mariela thinks that Will is taking the spontaneity out of his date, mea ning he’s eliminating.  “To take out of” means to eliminate, to get rid of.  She says, “Why don’t you play it by ear?”  The expression “to play (something) by ear” (ear)  means to be spontaneous, to have spontaneity, to decide at the moment  what you’re going to do without making plans.  This expression actually has anoth er meaning in English, and that can be found in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Mariela says, “I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pant s, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.”  “To fly by the seat of your pants” is another way of saying to be spontaneous, to have spontanei ty, to decide without making plans in advance.  Sometimes we use this expression  in a negative way to describe someone who should have planned but didn’t.  

Will responds, “Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into accoun t.”  “Preferences” are your desires, the things that you want.  “To take (somethi ng) into account” (account) means to consider what someone else is saying or to  consider that other thing.  “To take someone’s preferences into account”  means to think about what they want and make that part of your plan.  He says,  “If she wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.”   “Active” here means with a lot of physical movement; not just sitting or stand ing around and talking, but actually doing something, perhaps some sport or somet hing athletic.  The opposite of “active” is “passive,” this is when you just let  things happen; you don’t try to change things, you don’t get up and walk around o r do a lot of things.  Will says if his date, the women he’s going on the date with,  prefers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.  Mariela says, “Well, it soun ds like you’ve mapped out every possible alternative.”  By the way, I should ment ion that “active” can have other meanings in English, and those you can find in  the Learning Guide. Now, “to map out (something)” is a two-word phrasal ver b which means to decide or determine something: “I’m going to map out my pla ns for tomorrow.”  I’m going to write them down; I’m going to make some decisions.  S o when Mariela says, “it sounds like you have mapped out every possible alterna tive,” she means that Will has planned for every possible alternative.  “Altern ative” is possibility, choice, or option.    

 Then Mariela sees something, she says, “Hey, what’s this?”   Will says, “Give me that!”  He’s obviously angry at Mariela for taking it.  M ariela says, “I see you’ve mapped out more than just your date (what you’re goin g to do on your romantic date).  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your l ife together.”  A “trajectory” is the direction that something follows over time.  We usually use this, for example, when talking about a ball that you throw, or a rocket – a rocket engine that goes up into the sky – a missile.  The trajectory is th e path that it takes. Well, it can also be used to talk about the events or thi ngs that will happen in the future in someone’s life, and Mariela sees that Will has mapped out or planned the entirety trajectory of his life together with his da te: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that.  Of course th is is very unusual, especially since this appears to be the first date that Wil l has with this woman! 

Will says, “That is not meant for you.”  “To be meant fo r” means to be intended for, with you wanting something to happen.  “This is m eant for you,” this is intended for you, I’m doing this for you.  Well, the n ote is not intended for – it’s not meant for Mariela to look at; she’s not supposed to  see it.  Will says, “And plus (meaning in addition), it’s just a tentative plan. ”  “Tentative” (tentative) means possible but not yet final, not definite, not cert ain.  This is what I think will happen but it may change – my plan may change. 

Mariela says, “You mean Christine will have some say in it ?”  “To have a say in (something)” or “to have some say in (something)” means t o be participating in a decision, to have your opinions and your ideas matter in t he decision.  You’re part of the decision.  Will clearly thinks he will make mo st of the decisions.  He does say, “I may (meaning it’s possible) let her pick our chi ldren’s names,” select the names for the children.  That’s the decision that Wi ll’s date Christine will be given.  He then says to Mariela, “Now, get out of here,  will ya?!”  “Get out of here” means leave.  We use this expression “will you,” often spell ed and pronounced “will ya” (ya), to ask someone to do something.  It’s an informal, very informal way of asking someone to do you a favor – to do something for you.  “Will ya give me that pen?” meaning please give me that pen, that is what I want you to do. Will is using it at the end of the sentence, and that so metimes indicates that you are angry with the other person: “Stop talking to me, will ya?”  You’re telling the person something you don’t like about what they are doin g; you’re indicating, that is, that you are not happy.  And Will is not happy that Mariela saw this note that he wrote for himself, planning out his entire life wi th his date Christine.  Poor Christine! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
