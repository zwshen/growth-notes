This episode is a dialog between Karla and Joaquin,  about going to school to get a university degree in business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Karla:  I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school. Is that right?

Joaquin:  Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a l ong time, and have finally taken the plunge.  I need an MBA to get ahead in my caree r.

Karla:  That’s great, but why don’t you go part-tim e?

Joaquin:  I had considered taking classes on nights  and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Iv y League school, and I want to take full advantage of the opportunities there.

Karla:  Isn’t graduate school expensive, especially  an Ivy League school?

Joaquin:  Yeah, but I think it’s worth it, and I’ve  been saving up.  I have an undergraduate degree in accounting and finance, but  that’s not enough if I want to work in the upper echelons of this or any other company.

Karla:  I graduated with a degree marketing and inf ormation systems.  Maybe I should be thinking about getting an MBA.

Joaquin:  I’d recommend it, if you want to go furth er in your career.  I’ll lend you all of my test prep materials for the GMAT.

Karla:  The GMAT?  I’d forgotten about the GMAT.  T hat may be a deal breaker for me.

Joaquin:  Why?  You don’t like taking tests?

Karla:  I like taking tests as much as I like getti ng a kick upside the head – maybe even less!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Karla saying to Joaquin, “I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school.” A “leav e of absence” (absence) is a period of time when you leave your job but are allo wed to come back to your job when you finish doing whatever you are leaving your  job for. Some people may take a leave of absence because a family member is sick or they might take a leave of absence, as Joaquin is doing in the dialog , to go back to school and study some more. Not all companies allow you to tak e a leave of absence and typically, you’re not paid during your leave of abs ence. So, it has to be a situation that is either very serious or very important for y ou.

Joaquin is going to take a leave of absence to go t o business school, usually that means going to get a graduate degree after you’ve a lready completed your undergraduate, bachelor’s degree. Joaquin says, “Ye ah, I’ve been thinking about it for a long time and have finally taken the plung e.” The expression “to take the plunge” (plunge) means to decide to do something th at is perhaps a little scary, a little risky. You’re not sure what is going to happ en but you’re just going to go ahead and do it because you decide that the benefit s are going to be greater than the costs; that is, it will help you more than  it will hurt you. Joaquin says, “I need an MBA to get ahead in my career.” An “MBA” is  a Masters of Business Administration. That’s an advanced degree that prov ides education for people who are in business or who want to go into the busi ness world but need more education about topics such as finance, marketing, management, and other areas.

Karla says, “That’s great, but why don’t you go par t-time?” “Part-time” would be going to school but also doing something else. So, you may be working full-time – eight hours a day – and then at night, you may be  going to school part-time. Joaquin wants to go to school full-time. He wants t o quit his job and only go to school, or at least, go to school for most of the d ay and perhaps have a part-time job at night. Joaquin said “I had considered” – I h ad thought about – “taking classes on nights and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Ivy League school and I want to take full a dvantages of the opportunities

there.” The “Ivy (Ivy) League (League)” is a group of private colleges that are considered among the best colleges in the United St ates. There are, traditionally, eight Ivy League colleges – Columbia University, Br own, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Penn sylvania. So, Joaquin must be very smart and have a lot of money to get admitt ed into or accepted into an Ivy League school as a student.

Karla says, “Isn’t graduate school expensive, espec ially at an Ivy League school?” So immediately Karla asks the question tha t the average person would ask, which is, “Wow, how can you afford that?” “How  can you have enough money?” “Graduate school” is any university educati on you receive after your bachelor’s degree that usually leads to a master’s degree or a Ph.D. or doctorate in some topic. Joaquin says, “Yeah, but I think it’ s worth it and I’ve been saving up.” “To save up” is a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to be saving your money for a specific or particular purpose. Maybe you dec ide not to buy a new car because you want to save up to buy a new house. You  want to save your money. So, “to save up” is usually when we save our money for a specific purpose.

Joaquin says, “I have an undergraduate degree in ac counting and finance but that’s not enough if I want to work in the upper ec helons of this, or any other company.” An “undergraduate degree,” we referred to  earlier, is usually called a bachelor’s degree. It’s something that you get afte r studying at least four years at the university, or in my case, seven years, because  I wasn’t very intelligent. You see, it took me a long time.

“Accounting” is the activity of making sure you kee p good records of how much money you bring into the company and how much you s pend. It’s an organized, what we might describe as “systematic” way of keepi ng track of or knowing how much money you’re getting and how much money you’re  spending. “Finance” is when you are managing a large amount of money for a n organization – making sure that the organization has enough money. That w ould be part of finance.

Joaquin has a bachelor’s degree – an undergraduate degree – in accounting and finance, so he knows something about business. But he says, “That’s not enough” – that’s not sufficient – if he wants to wo rk in the “upper echelons” of his company. The “upper echelons” (echelons) refers to the very top of a large organization or company. The presidents, the vice p residents, the top managers – we would call them the top “executives” who work in a company. They are part of the upper echelon.

Karla says, “I graduated with a degree in marketing  and information systems.” “Marketing” is the area of a company or a business,  responsible for letting other

people know about your products, of trying to get p eople to buy your products by, for example, having advertising. That might be part  of the marketing department in a company. “Information systems” is the part of the company that is responsible for the computer technology, especially  how this information is used to help organize and run the company. That’s inform ation systems – a relatively new part of business in the last 50 years or so.

Karla says, “Maybe I should be thinking about getti ng an MBA.” Joaquin says, “I’d recommend it” – I think it’s a good idea – “if  you want to go further in your career” – in other words, if you want to get a bett er and higher-paying job in the future. Joaquin says, “I’ll lend you all of my test  prep materials for the GMAT.” So, Joaquin is going to let Karla use his “test pre p” materials. “Test prep” is short for “test preparation.” It’s the process of studyin g for a specific exam, learning what kind of questions will be asked, practicing yo ur answers – that’s part of test prep.

“GMAT” is the Graduate Management Admissions Test. This is the test that most business schools use in the United States for their  MBA programs. They give it to anyone who wants to go there, and you will need to get a certain score – a certain result – if you want to get into the school . The more difficult the school, the higher the GMAT score will be, the higher the G MAT score that you will need to get into that school. GMAT, like the SAT, like o ther similar tests, are used to decide who gets into the university and who doesn’t .

Karla says “The GMAT? I had forgotten about the GMA T. That maybe a deal breaker for me.” A “deal (deal) breaker (breaker)” is something that makes it impossible for you to do something because you don’ t want to do it or you can’t do it. For example, I wanted to go out on a date wi th this beautiful girl but she was a smoker. And that was a deal breaker for me. S he liked to smoke cigarettes and so I decide, “No. I could not date anyone who s moked cigarettes.” That’s not true, of course. When I was dating, I would date an y woman who would say “yes” to going out with me, to going on a date with me. B ut some people might consider smoking, for example, to be a deal breaker .

Joaquin says, “Why? You don’t like taking tests?” K arla says, “I like taking tests as much as I like getting a kick upside the head.” A “kick upside (upside) the head” is an expression used when you have done some thing foolish or stupid. It’s almost as though someone were punishing you by  kicking you in the head because you were so stupid. You were so dumb. Karla  says that she likes taking tests as much as getting a kick upside the head. In  other words, she doesn’t like it at all. And therefore, having to take this test – the GMAT – to go to graduate

school would definitely be a deal breaker. It would  be something that would make her decide that she was not going to do that.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
