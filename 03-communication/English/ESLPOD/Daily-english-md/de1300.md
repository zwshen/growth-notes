# Diversifying a Workforce

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,300 – Diversifying a Workforce.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,300. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Audrey and Simon  about trying to get different kinds of people working at a company. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Audrey: Have you seen these design ideas? They’re s tale.

Simon: Maybe it’s time we diversified our workforce . It’s pretty homogenous right now.

Audrey: It’s not that homogeneous. We have people f rom different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multicult ural.

Simon: That’s not what I mean and you know it. We’r e missing a huge demographic. Having more diversity will help us fin d new ways to tackle problems and come up with creative ideas.

Audrey: Are you saying we’ve become stodgy? I’m not  adverse to change, you know.

Simon: I know that.

Audrey: But how will the rest of the company react?

Simon: I don’t know, but a more diverse workforce w ill also prevent discrimination lawsuits. That’s the reality we live in.

Audrey: I really don’t know. Do you really think hi ring more men to design women’s bras is a good idea?

Simon: Of course. We have a unique appreciation for  them.

 Audrey begins our dialogue by asking Simon, “Have y ou seen these design ideas? They’re stale.” “Design” (design) is a plan for how something is going to look or the actual way that something looks, the fo rm it takes, perhaps the colors that are present. We’re not sure what Audrey is tal king about in terms of design here. It could be design for clothing. It could be design for a computer or a phone.

In any case, she says that the design ideas they ha ve are “stale” (stale). Here, “stale” means not new or not interesting. “Stale” i s used to mean outdated or perhaps old. Simon says, “Maybe it’s time we divers ified our workforce.” The “workforce” (workforce) is the group of people who work at a certain company. It could also refer to all of the people who work in a  given community or even in a certain country, but Simon I think is talking about  the people in this particular company.

Simon thinks “it’s time,” meaning the company shoul d think about diversifying the workforce. “To diversify” (diversify) means to have  more variety, more variations – different kinds of, in this case, people. We’re n ot sure exactly what Simon is talking about. He could be talking about people fro m different backgrounds, different experiences. I’m not sure if that will he lp their design ideas, but Simon thinks so.

He says, “It’s pretty homogenous right now.” “Homog enous” (homogenous) refers to something being all the same. If the work force is “homogenous,” everyone comes from the same kind of background or has the same experience, perhaps. Audrey says, “It’s not that homogenous,” m eaning we do have some different kinds of people working for us. “We have people from different cultures and backgrounds, people who are bilingual and multi cultural.”

“Bilingual” (bilingual) means someone who can speak  two languages. The prefix “bi” (bi) means two, so “bilingual” is two language s. If someone spoke three languages, he would be “trilingual” – (tri), meanin g three. Someone who speaks more than three languages is usually called a “poly glot” (polyglot). Audrey says that their employees are also, at least some of the m, “multicultural.” “Multi” (multi) as a prefix means many, so representing many differ ent cultures or having experiences in many different cultures.

Simon says, “That’s not what I mean and you know it ,” meaning you know that’s not what I was saying. He says, “We’re missing a hu ge demographic.” The term “demographic” (demographic) here means a certain gr oup within the larger population. He says, “Having more diversity will he lp us find ways to tackle

problems and come up with creative ideas.” “To tack le (tackle) problems” means to deal with difficult situations – to solve diffic ult problems or find solutions to problems. “To tackle” means to take care of or to h andle. “Come up with” means to create or to invent.

Simon says that having more diversity in their work force will help them find new ways to “come up with creative (creative) ideas” – new and interesting ideas. Audrey says, “Are you saying that we’ve become stod gy?” “Stodgy” (stodgy) is similar to “stale.” It means old and boring, not in teresting or perhaps old fashioned. Audrey says, “I’m not adverse to change,  you know.” “To be adverse (adverse) to” something means not wanting to or bei ng interested in doing something – in this case, in changing.

Audrey says she’s not adverse to change. Simon says , “I know that.” Audrey responds, “But how will the rest of the company rea ct?” That is, what will other people think or say. Simon says, “I don’t know, but  a more diverse workforce will also prevent discrimination lawsuits.” “Discriminat ion” (discrimination) refers to not treating people equally, not doing the same thi ng for one group that you would do for another in a way that would generally be considered illegal or against the law.

A “lawsuit” (lawsuit) is when a legal case is broug ht against a company or individual by someone who thinks that he has been h armed by that other person, damaged in some way. Usually a lawsuit is over mone y. The person wants money in order to make up for some harm that he has  suffered because of what another person has done.

For example, if someone runs into your car with his  car and doesn’t want to pay for the damage – for the fact that your car no long er works, let’s say – you might bring a lawsuit against that person. You might go t o a judge and say, “This person has ruined my car. I want him to pay me mone y,” and you can use the government to help you force that person to pay you  money. That’s basically what a “lawsuit” is.

A “discrimination lawsuit,” then, would be someone who takes a company or a person to court and makes the court correct the pro blem, if you will, that might include giving that person money. Simon says, “That ’s the reality we live in,” meaning the world we live in is such that we need t o protect ourselves to prevent discrimination lawsuits. Audrey says, “I really don ’t know. Do you really think hiring more men to design women’s bras is a good id ea?”

Now we learn that Simon and Audrey work at a compan y that makes bras. A “bra” (bra) is something that a woman usually wears  under other clothing, under a shirt or a dress, that protects and supports her breasts, the two things that are found at the top of a woman’s body usually. I guess  men also have breasts, but we don’t normally think of them as wearing bras, th ough perhaps some of them should.

Anyway, Audrey is wondering whether getting more me n to work for the company will really be a good idea since the company makes bras for women. Simon says, “Of course. We,” meaning men, “have a unique apprec iation for them.” “Unique” (unique) is one of a kind, or unlike anything else.  “Appreciation” (appreciation) is an admiration for something or a feeling of pleasur e or respect for something or someone.

A “unique appreciation” here means that men, unlike  most women, are able to think about bras in a different way, perhaps. You p robably can understand why men might have a unique appreciation for bras.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
