This episode is called “Developing a Healthy Mind.”  It’s a conversation between Luke and Lorelai, giving their views on what it means to  have a healthy mind. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorelai:  I just finished reading a book about how to get the most out of life. Starting today, I’m going to live life to its fullest.

Luke:  Oh no, not another one of your fads.  Weren’t yo u eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?

Lorelai:  This is not a fad!  I’m changing my lifestyle so  I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.

Luke:  And didn’t you go through a phase where you spoke only to animals?

Lorelai:  I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwel ling on the past.  I’m living in the moment and enjoying everything around me.  I’m ignorin g your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.

Luke:  What are you doing now?

Lorelai:  I’m practicing mindfulness.  I’m repeating m y mantra and calming my mind.  You should try meditation.  It may help you with  your problems.

Luke:  What problems?

 Lorelai:  We could start with your judgmental attitud e and your close- mindedness.  How’s that?

Luke:  Forget it!  Nothing can get me to buy your late st hocus pocus!

This episode is called “Developing a Healthy Mind.”  “Hea lthy” is the opposite of “sickly” or “ill.”  We usually use this term to talk about yo ur physical body.  But here, it’s being used a little differently, it’s being used to talk about your mind, the way you think and whether that is healthy or not – the w ay you think, perhaps. People have different ideas about this, of course.

Lorelai begins our conversation by saying that she just fini shed reading a book about how to get the most out of life.  The expression  “to get the most out of life” means to enjoy life as much as possible, to experience lif e in its fullness – in its completeness.  Usually people talk about this when they are  referring to success or enjoying life somehow.  So, Lorelai’s reading a boo k which is very common at least in the United States, what we call “self-help” bo oks, books that people read to try to make them happier or better or healthier.  Lorelai says that she’s going to live, starting today, life to its fullest.  “To live life to the fullest” means something similar to “getting the most out of life,” to enjoy life as much as possible.

Luke says, “Oh no, not another one of your fads.”  A “fad ” (fad) is something that becomes popular very quickly and remains popular for a short  period of time, and then everybody forgets about it.  This happens with songs, this happens with television shows, it happens with dances.  In particular,  I remember a few years ago there was a dance fad called the Macarena, and it h ad these moves that you would…oh well, forget it.  It was a fad, and everyone’ s forgotten it already. That’s what a fad is, something you forget that is very po pular but then is no longer popular.  In the 1970s a fad was pet rocks.  Peop le sold these rocks like they were pets; it was amazing!

So anyway, getting back to our story Luke says, “Weren’t yo u eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?”  Obviously Lorelai likes to try new and different, perhaps strange things, like eating food that is blue and red. Lorelai says that this is not a fad.  “I’m changing my lif estyle so I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.”  Your “lifestyl e” is the way that you live, the way you spend your time for example.  “Fulfilling” means sat isfying, giving you a sense of happiness and completion.  So, a fulfilling lif e would be a life that was satisfying, that was happy, that was complete.

 Luke says, “And didn’t you go through a phase where you o nly spoke to animals?”  Luke is reminding Lorelai of all of the some what crazy fads that she was part of in the past.  He says, “didn’t you go throug h a phase?”  “To go through a phase” (phase) to means to experience a certai n period in your life when you become very interested in a certain thing; it’s sort of like a fad, but it’s something that you personally get involved in.  It could be for months or even years.  The expression is often used to talk about people who are going through some sort of change in their life that perhaps isn’t ne cessarily positive or is experiencing some sort of difficulty.  We might talk abou t a teenager going through a phase.  They’re going through a part of th eir life where they’re angry at everyone or they don’t like to talk to their parents.  Th is is usually a somewhat temporary situation; it doesn’t go on forever, we hope.   That would be going through a phase.

Lorelai says, “I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwe lling on the past.”  “To dwell (dwell) on (something)” means to spend a lot of time thinking about something, especially something that makes you sad or makes you angry. People may say, “Don’t dwell on it” if something bad ha ppens to you – don’t keep thinking about it over and over again.  “Dwell” has a co uple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Lorelai says, “I’m living in the moment and enjoying ever ything around me.”  This is a popular self-help idea: to live in the moment – to focus on what you are doing right now; don’t worry about the past, don’t worry abo ut the future.  Live in the moment – live in the now.  Lorelai says, “I’m ignoring  your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.”  “Negativity”  is when someone always sees the bad side of things, one only thinks about the negative things. The noun is “negativity.”  “To appreciate” means to recog nize the goodness in something, to value something.  So, Lorelai says she’s going to ignore Luke’s negativity and concentrate on appreciating the moment – appreciating what’s happening right now.

Luke says, “What are you doing now?”  Lorelai says, “I’m pr acticing mindfulness.” “To practice” means to follow some rules or guidelines a bout how to live your life, in this case.  But “practice” has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at that Learning Guide, once again, for some more expla nations.  Lorelai is practicing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness” is a notion – an i dea that you are aware of what is going on around you; you are paying attention to what you are doing. There’s an old expression: “to be mindful of (something )” means to be paying attention, to be concentrating on, to know what was g oing on.  More recently, people have talked about mindfulness as being a way that  you are always aware

 of what is around you, and this is supposed to somehow he lp you be calmer, help you appreciate life.

Lorelai goes on to say that she’s repeating her mantra a nd calming her mind. She says to Luke, “You should try meditation.  It may hel p you with your problems.”  So, Lorelai is doing “meditation,” which is the practice in many different traditions, both religious and nonreligiou s, of focusing on something, controlling your thoughts.  In some types of meditation, it’s focusing only on one thing.  In other types of meditation it could be trying  to focus on nothing – emptying your mind, if you will.  Those are kinds of medi tation.  One way of meditating in some traditions is to use what’s called a “mantra” (mantra).  This is a word or a phrase that you repeat many times to yourself  quietly as a part of concentrating – focusing on a certain thing, and not havi ng other thoughts.  The idea is that it makes you calmer physically – physiologically.  “To calm your mind” means to give you a sense of relaxation, of peace.

Lorelai says that Luke should try meditation to help him  with his problems.  Luke says, “What problems?”  Lorelai says, “We could start with your judgmental attitude and your close-mindedness.”  “We could start” mea ns well, there are many things that we could talk about, but here’s one.  “We could start with you judgmental attitude.”  To be “judgmental” means to a lways be giving someone your opinion, whether you like something or don’t like so mething.  Usually, it’s a negative way of talking about someone.  If you say someone is judgmental, that’s a criticism.  You’re saying they’re always telling people t hings they don’t like – they’re always judging other people, criticizing other p eople.  So, you’re criticizing them, which I guess would make you judgmental, I’m not sure.  “Close- mindedness” means not willing to listen to other peopl e’s opinions or ideas, only having your own ideas and not even paying attention to what other people are saying, not being willing to listen to other people.  Lorelai is saying that Luke is judgmental and close-minded.

Luke says, “Forget it!  Nothing can get me to buy your lat est hocus pocus!” When Luke uses the expression “to buy,” he doesn’t mean gi ve money to someone in order to that something back.  He means to be lieve or accept something.  Someone may say to you, “I’m not buying it.  He says that he didn’t go to work today, but I’m not buying it.”  That means “ I don’t believe it; I don’t accept it.”  Well Luke doesn’t believe the ideas that Lo relai has about meditation and mantras and mindfulness; he says “I’m not going to bu y your latest hocus pocus!”  “Hocus pocus” is something that, in this case, is imp ossible or false.  It’s a set of ideas that you think are silly – that you think a re nonsense, and that’s what Luke thinks about Lorelai’s ideas.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
