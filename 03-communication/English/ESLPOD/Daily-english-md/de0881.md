This episode is a dialog between Ralph and Nicky, a bout eating what is called genetically modified foods. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ralph:  What’s that?

Nicky:  It’s a bigger and better tomato.  It’s been  genetically modified.

Ralph:  You’re not going to eat that, are you?

Nicky:  Of course I am.  I’m making a salad.  Want one?

Ralph:  No way.  I don’t want to eat something that ’s been genetically engineered in a laboratory.  Who knows what kind of strange DN A it has.

Nicky:  It’s perfectly safe.  It’s been modified to  grow faster, have more nutrients, and be resistant to disease and pests.

Ralph:  And it may contain strange mutations as par t of its genetic makeup that they didn’t tell you about.  I really wouldn’t eat that if I were you.

Nicky:  Where did you get this aversion to genetica lly modified foods?  Scientists and farmers have always used selective breeding wit h animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food.  This is nothing differ ent.

Ralph:  Of course it is.  And just because it’s big ger, doesn’t mean it’s better.  I’ll eat food that’s been modified by the only person I trust.

Nicky:  Who’s that?

 Ralph:  Mother Nature!

Our dialog begins with Ralph saying to Nicky, “What ’s that?” Nicky says “It's a bigger and better tomato.” A tomato is something th at you might eat with a salad or on a sandwich, or use to make sauce for your pas ta. Nicky says “It's a bigger and better tomato. It's been genetically modified.”  “To modify” (modify) means to change something. “To genetically modify something”  means to change the genes, if you will, the components of a plant or an  animal that determine what kind of plant and animal that is. “Genes” (genes) a re what we might call the building blocks of life. They’re the basic componen ts, the elements that life is constructed on. It's hard to explain that in a very  complete manner here, but that's what “genetically” means related to your gen es.

Ralph says, “You're not going to eat that, are you? ” Ralph doesn't think Nicky should eat it. Nicky says, “Of course I am. I'm mak ing a salad. Want one?” – meaning do you want one? Ralph says, “No way.” “No way” is a very strong way of saying “No, absolutely not.” “No way. I don't wa nt to eat something that's been genetically engineered in a laboratory.” “To engine er,” (engineer) as a verb, means to change, to usually change the structure of  something. “Genetically engineered” would be something where scientists hav e changed the genetic makeup, the genetic composition of that particular plant or animal. A “laboratory” is a place where scientists do experiments.

Ralph says, “Who knows what kind of strange DNA it has.” “DNA” is the chemical substance that carries the genetic information. It' s what carries the information from our genes that affects our eye color, our skin  color, our physical makeup and so forth. Nicky says that, “This tomato is perf ectly safe.” It's completely safe. “It's been modified to grow faster, have more nutri ents and be resistant to disease and pests.”

So, Nicky is saying the tomato is safe. “It has bee n changed only to make it grow faster to give it more nutrients, and to make it re sistant to disease and pests.” “Nutrients” (nutrients) is a general word used to d escribe the substances or the elements within a plant that help you grow, that an imals eat, or humans eat that helps their body grow better. It could be a lot of different things. Each food would have different kinds of nutrients.

Nicky says that the tomato was also modified to be resistant to disease and pests. “To be resistant” means that you are not eas ily damaged by something,

you are not easily harmed by something. “Disease” i s the same as sickness or illness, when something is not growing and function ing the way it should. “Pests” (pests) are insects or small animals that destroy p lants, that destroy the plants that we use to get food from. So pests are always b ad things, whether they’re mosquitoes or rodents or any other sort of animal t hat is going to harm the plants that we are growing to eat.

Ralph says, “And it may contain strange mutations a s part of its genetic makeup that they don't tell you about.” Ralph is saying th at these genetically modified foods are dangerous because they may contain strang e mutations. A “mutation” (mutation) is a genetic change that makes one indiv idual different from another individual. But it's not, if you will, a change tha t you would expect to take place. So, usually mutation, when we're talking about scie nce fiction, for example, is when something changes in some weird way, some stra nge way that is considered dangerous or unusual. Mutation is part o f the way that the world works in terms of DNA and genes, but here Ralph is using the word as a negative, as a criticism of this genetically modifi ed food. Ralph says that these mutations could be part of the tomatoes’ genetic ma keup. We’ve already talked about what “genetic” refers to. “Makeup” (makeup) –  one word – refers to composition what something is made of. Ralph says, “I really wouldn't eat that if I were you.” That's a common expression, “If I were y ou” – if I were in your situation, I would not do that.

Nicky says, “Where did you get this aversion to gen etically modified foods?” An “aversion” (aversion) is a hatred or strong dislike  of something, something that you would want to avoid. Nicky says, “Scientists an d farmers have always used selective breeding with animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food. This is nothing different.” “Selective breeding” (b reeding) is the practice of making plants or animals reproduce, or produce new plants or animals that have particular characteristics that you want to increas e.

So, if you have two different kinds of dogs and you  want to make a dog that is a mixture of these two kinds of dogs, well, you would  put the two dogs together – one would have to be male and one would have to be female, of course – and let them do what they do, and then you would “breed” a new animal, a combination of these two different animals. “Selective breeding ” is using that basic logic, that basic process with plants or animals, in order to p roduce plants or animals that have certain characteristics. That's what Nicky say s farmers and scientists have been doing for many years and that this is nothing different.

Ralph says, “Of course it is.” “And just because it 's bigger” – meaning, the tomato – “doesn't mean it's better. I'll eat food that's b een modified by the only person I

trust.” “To trust” means to believe, in this case, or to rely on. Nicky asked, “Who’s that?” – who is that person that you trust? Ralph r esponds, “Mother Nature.” Mother Nature is not a real person. We say “Mother Nature” to refer to the idea that the whole world, the natural world is somehow controlled by this female figure, I guess. Mother Nature refers to the way the environment is, the way nature is without people interfering with it, witho ut men and women making changes to the environment. That's basically the id ea behind this term “Mother Nature.”

Ralph treats Mother Nature as a real person that he  can trust. What he's really saying here is that he only wants to eat food that is somehow natural, that doesn't have any sort of either chemicals, perhaps,  or genetic modifications that would change the way the food is produced.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
