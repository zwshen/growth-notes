This episode is called “Things Associated with Autu mn,” or fall, the season that in the United States comes between the months of, say,  September and December. We’re going to talk about vocabulary – things that we would talk about or relate to the fall or autumn.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Erin:  Smell that!

Sean:  Smell what?

Erin:  Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons?   I love autumn.  The fall colors are out and there’s a chill is in the air.

Sean:  That means I’ll be raking leaves every weeke nd when I should be watching football.

Erin:  How can you be so grumpy when you see cute l ittle squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?

Sean:  That just means they’re running across the r oof even more often, waking me up every morning.

Erin:  Not even you can put a damper on my good moo d.  I can’t wait for homecoming games and especially the harvest festiva ls.  They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mores!

Sean:  As you know, I have hay allergies and those bonfires are a danger to the environment.  And I don’t like s’mores, in the summ er or in the fall.

Erin:  How can you be such a party-pooper?

Sean:  The only good thing about the fall is that i t’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation, so I won’t have to worry  about running into one.  Hey, what’s this?

Erin:  This is a cup of hot chocolate to put you in  the fall mood.  Drink up and we’ll go for a walk outside.  It’s a beautiful day and a walk will help you see all that you’re missing.

Sean:  I’ll drink the hot chocolate, but don’t expe ct any epiphanies.

Erin begins by saying to Sean, “Smell that!”  Sean says, “Smell what?”  Erin says, “Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons? ”  The “seasons” are the four periods of the year: summer, spring, fall, and wint er.  The “changing of the seasons” is when we go from one season to another.  Erin says, “Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons?  I love autumn.”  “Aut umn” is another word for fall. Erin says, “The fall colors are out and there’s a c hill is in the air.”  “Fall colors” refer to the leaves on the trees that in many parts  of the country – in the U.S. – change colors in the fall as the leaves begin to di e and fall to the ground during winter.  Autumn is full of fall colors in the north eastern and midwestern parts of the U.S., and also in parts of California.  When I was growing up, you could drive out into the country or along one of Minnesota’s ri vers and see the beautiful orange and yellow of the trees as the leaves change d or turned colors.  So, that’s what fall colors refer to.  A “chill” is a low temp erature, when it isn’t warm out.  It isn’t freezing, it’s somewhat between warm and free zing, but on the cold side, so a little cold.

Sean says, “That means I’ll be raking leaves every weekend when I should be watching football.”  “To rake (rake) leaves” means to collect the leaves that fall off of the trees, to collect them from your lawn – the grass in front or behind your house – to collect them all together and to either put them in a bag to get rid of them or some people use them as part of their ferti lizing process, to put them back into the ground after treating them somehow.  When I was a child, sometimes we would burn the leaves, put them all in  one big pile and burn them. They don’t do that very much anymore; it’s not safe  and it also causes a certain amount of smoke pollution.  But, that’s what it mea ns to rake leaves.  There’s a noun, “rake,” which refers to the tool, the thing t hat you use.  It’s sort of like a broom, and you use it to move the leaves to put the m all into one place.  So, “to

rake,” as a verb, means to use that plastic or meta l tool to clean off the leaves, if you will, from your lawn or grass.

Erin is excited about the autumn coming.  Sean, how ever, sees the negative side, that he will have to rake leaves instead of w atching American football, which traditionally is played in the fall and early  winter.

Erin says, “How can you be so grumpy when you see c ute little squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?”  “To b e grumpy” (grumpy) means to be annoyed, angry; not really mad, just sort of neg ative about things.  Not being nice to other people, perhaps being overly sensitiv e to other people’s remarks, that’s grumpy.  It might be the way a wife describe s her husband when he is not in a good mood, when he isn’t feeling well for exam ple.  Erin says that there are little squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter.  A “squirrel” is a small animal that likes to climb trees and eat nuts and s eeds.  I grew up in Minnesota, where there are lots of squirrels.  “To squirrel aw ay” as a verb means to save, to store for later, to keep for the future.  The idea is that that’s what squirrels do; they gather food for the wintertime.  “To squirrel away” means to save for something; to “save up,” we might say.

Sean says, “That just means they (the squirrels) ar e running across the roof even more, waking me up in the morning.”  He’s saying th at because the squirrels are going to be so active trying to save food for the w intertime, they will be running on top of his house and he will get woken up in the  morning because of it.  I have squirrels that climb on the top of my house all the  time, and you can hear their little feet as they run across the roof.

Erin says, “Not even you can put a damper on my goo d mood.”  “To put a damper (damper) on (something)” means to lessen or reduce someone’s interest or enthusiasm or excitement.  “The heavy storm put a damper on the outside party.”  It lessened people’s enthusiasm for someth ing.  Erin says that not even Sean and his grumpy mood can put a damper on her go od mood.  The word “damper,” along with the word “chill,” has some oth er meanings in English.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations of those.

Erin says, “I can’t wait for homecoming games and e specially the harvest festivals.”  A “homecoming game” is an event in a h igh school or at a university typically in the fall, that includes some sort of s ports game and usually a dance or some sort of party.  The word “homecoming” comes fr om “come home.”  In this case, former students, people who used to go to a s chool, are invited back on homecoming day or homecoming weekend to go to the s ports game, often an American football game, and then to a party – altho ugh usually they don’t go to

the parties, that’s just for the current students.  Homecoming is a big event in most American high schools and in many American col leges and universities. There are dances; there are all sorts of things ass ociated with that custom.

A “harvest festival” celebrates the time when farme rs go out into the fields and get the food that has grown during the summertime; we call that the “harvest.” “To harvest,” as a verb, means to go out and collec t the food – the corn, the wheat, other food that you are growing and bring it  in, and it is popular in many places.  Again, I can speak mostly from my own expe rience in the Midwest there are lots of harvest festivals in the fall, in Septe mber and October, celebrating the end of the growing season and, of course, giving th anks, was the original idea, for the food that one has received or one has taken  from the fields from were the food grows.

She says, “They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mor es!”  A hayride” (hayride) is when you sit on a long, flat trailer that’s being p ulled by either some sort of farm machinery, like a tractor, or horses, and it’s basi cally a form of entertainment. You go for a little ride out into the countryside o r into the farm.  We used to go on hayrides when I was a child.  We would go out away from the city and you could have a hayride.  Usually it was organized by some s ort of group, and everybody paid a small amount of money to go on this hayride.   “Bonfires” (bonfires) are large fires outdoors.  You remember I mentioned abo ut burning the leaves when I was a child.  Well, if you did that outdoors, out i n the field somewhere, we might call that a “bonfire” if it’s a large fire.  It’s a  controlled fire.  It’s not just burning everything around, it’s in one specific small area.   “S’mores” (s’mores) is a kind of dessert made in the summertime and in the fall with  marshmallows, a piece of chocolate, and two crackers, what we call “graham c rackers.”  It’s like a little chocolate and marshmallow sandwich.  It sounds disg usting – doesn’t sound very good, but it tastes okay.

Sean says, “As you know, I have hay allergies and t hose bonfires are a danger to the environment.  And I don’t like s’mores, in the summer or in the fall.” “Allergies” is a physical condition, where you have  a reaction to certain substances.  It could be some parts of a flower, it  could be a type of food; some people have food allergies to peanuts for example.  He, Sean, has hay allergies, what we more commonly would call “hay fever,” even though it isn’t a fever; you don’t have a high temperature like you would normal ly in a fever.  Sean says the “bonfires are a danger to the environment,” because  of all the smoke, which is why in many places you can no longer have a bonfire  – in the United States, anyway.

Erin says, “How can you be such a party-pooper?”  A  “party-pooper” (pooper) is a person who ruins other people’s fun, someone who’s negative, who doesn’t participate, or doesn’t want anyone else to have fu n at a party or some celebration.

Sean says, “The only good thing about the fall is t hat it’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation.”  “Hibernation” is a lon g period of time when animals, like bears, sleep, usually during the coldest part of the year.  Sean says because the bears are in hibernation he won’t have to worry  about running into one; that is, unexpectedly finding one, which of course might  be dangerous.  Then he says, “Hey, what’s this?”  Erin says, “This is a cu p of hot chocolate to put you in the fall mood.”  “Hot chocolate” is liquid, usually  water or milk mixed with chocolate and heated up.  She says, “Drink up (mean ing drink it all) and we’ll go for a walk outside.  It’s a beautiful day and a wal k will help you see all that you are missing.”  Sean says, “I’ll drink the hot choco late, but don’t expect any epiphanies.”  An “epiphany” (epiphany) is when you have a sudden understanding of something, an experience that some how makes you understand something that you never understood befo re.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
