This episode is a dialogue about getting advice, ge tting suggestions, from the mother of your spouse – your mother-in-law. Let’s g et started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Marc: Who was that?  

Carla: It was your mother – again. She wanted to gi ve me another piece of unsolicited advice about housekeeping. She’s called  five times this week already. 

Marc: She’s just trying to be helpful.  

Carla: I wish she’d do it without being so critical . I feel like she enjoys finding fault with everything I do. 

Marc: She’s a little overeager to help, that’s all.  Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support. She isn’t li ke your mother. 

Carla: What do you mean? 

Marc: What do I mean?! She’s constantly giving me a dvice on how to be a better husband. 

Carla: Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be the best it can be. 

Marc: I know, but your mother has a really sharp to ngue and she doesn’t hold back. She butts in whenever I’m trying to do someth ing to tell me how to do it better. 

Carla: Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help. 

Marc: With her constant sarcastic comments? 

Carla: That’s just her sense of humor. She doesn’t mean anything by it. She likes you. 

Marc: She has a strange way of showing it. 

Carla: All of this talk about mothers-in-law is get ting our blood up. At this rate, we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve received so far. 

Marc: Which was? 

Carla: Don’t go to bed angry. 

Marc: Who’s angry? 

[end of dialogue] 

Marc begins our dialogue by saying to Carla, “Who w as that?” Carla says, “It was your mother – again.” Apparently, the two of them h ad been talking on the phone. Carla continues, “She wanted to give me another pie ce of unsolicited advice about housekeeping.” Notice the somewhat interestin g phrase – well, interesting to me – “piece (piece) of advice (advice).”  

“Advice” is guidance or suggestions that you give s omeone on how to do something. We don’t use the plural of advice. We do n’t say “advices,” but we do say “pieces of advice,” or sometimes “some advice.”  Someone may to you, “Let me give you a piece of advice” – let me give you a suggestion. Here, Carla is talking about “unsolicited advice.” “Unsolicited” c omes from the verb “to solicit” (solicit) which means to ask someone for something.   

Someone who comes to your house, knocks on your doo r, and asks for money for some political cause or some other reason is “s oliciting” money from you. You can also “solicit advice.” You can ask other people  to give you suggestions. However, when you don’t ask someone for advice and he gives it to you anyway, that’s what we would call “unsolicited (unsolicited ) advice” – unasked-for advice.   

 Most people don’t want unsolicited advice, but appa rently Carla’s mother-in-law likes to give it. The term “mother-in-law” refers n ot to your biological or legal mother, but to the mother of your wife or husband. Carla is getting unsolicited advice from her mother-in-law, from Marc’s (her hus band’s) mother. What is it about? It’s about “housekeeping” (housekeeping) – a ll one word. “Housekeeping” refers to the things you do to keep your house clea n and organized.  

There’s a popular magazine called Good Housekeeping . It is a magazine all about keeping your house clean and orderly – and, I  suppose, cooking. I don’t know. I’ve never read it before. It’s a magazine th at traditionally has been very popular among women, especially women who are at ho me cleaning up their houses. That’s changed somewhat over the years. Men  now, I’m told, help in cleaning the house more than they used to. I’m not sure how much that’s really true in most marriages, but there you go.  

Carla says, “She’s called five times this week alre ady.” Marc says, “She’s just trying to be helpful.” Carla says, “I wish she’d do  it without being so critical.” “To be critical” (critical) here means to tell someone what she is doing wrong in a negative way. As an adjective, “critical” has a cou ple of different uses. But here, it just means to point out to or to let someone know a bout something he is doing wrong, but in a negative way.  

Carla says, “I feel like she,” meaning her mother-i n-law, “enjoys finding fault with everything I do.” “To find fault” (fault) with some one means to identify or to point out problems with something – to find what’s wrong with the situation or the way someone is acting. Marc says, “She’s a little overe ager to help, that’s all.” “To be overeager” (overeager) is to be too enthusiastic ab out something, to be too interested in doing something. The word “eager” des cribes someone who wants to do something. “To be overeager” means to want to  do it a little bit too much.  

Marc says that his mother is just overeager to help  poor Carla. He continues, “Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support.” “To be interfering” (interfering) means to become involved  in something that isn’t really your business, to want to get involved in or give a dvice about something that isn’t something you should be concerned with – that “isn’ t your business,” we would say. Marc is saying his mother is not interfering. She just wants to give Carla support. “Support” (support) just means here assist ance or help.  

Then Marc says something really interesting. He say s that his mother isn’t like Carla’s mother. Well, now, of course, Carla isn’t g oing to be very happy. Carla says, “What do you mean?” Marc says, “What do I mea n?” He can’t believe that  

Carla doesn’t understand what he’s talking about. T hen he goes on to describe what Carla’s mother is like.  

He says, “She’s constantly giving me advice on how to be a better husband.” “Constantly” means frequently and repeatedly, conti nuously without stopping, or simply all the time. Marc thinks that his mother-in -law – that is, Carla’s mother – is always giving him advice on how to be a better h usband. Carla says, “Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be t he best it can be.” So now Carla is defending her own mother, saying, “Oh no, my mother isn’t that bad.” Marc says, “I know, but your mother has a really sh arp tongue and she doesn’t hold back.”  

“To have a sharp (sharp) tongue” means to be very h onest with someone, but in a way that is very critical, in a way that can ofte n be very mean. “To have a sharp tongue” usually means to be very direct with someon e, but in a way that can seem hurtful, can hurt another person’s feelings. “ To hold back” is a phrasal verb meaning not to do something that you might want to do or you might want to say. “Not to hold back” means that you say what you want . You don’t worry about hurting someone else’s feelings.  

Marc describes Carla’s mother as someone who “doesn ’t hold back.” “She butts in whenever I’m trying to do to something to tell m e how to do it better,” says Marc. “To butt (butt) in” is an interesting two-wor d phrasal verb, meaning to interfere. It’s an informal expression, however. “P lease don’t butt in” means “Please don’t interfere.” Please don’t get involved  in this situation, or perhaps simply in this conversation.  

It’s a somewhat rude thing to say to someone. You w ouldn’t tell your boss not to butt in. You might tell a friend or a family member  not to butt in. It is, however, a criticism of the person who is doing the interferin g. Carla says, “Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help.” So now Carla is  defending her mother, comparing her to Marc’s mother. Marc says, “With he r constant sarcastic comments?”  

“To be sarcastic” (sarcastic) means to use words th at have the opposite meaning of what you are really trying to say in a way that is supposed to be funny. So, for example, someone comes in and they’re very cold and  they want you to turn up the heat. You might say, “Wow, pretty hot out there , huh?” You’re saying something to be funny. You’re saying that it’s hot out there when you know of course it’s actually very cold out there. That’s be ing sarcastic.  

Carla says her mother is not sarcastic. She says, “ That’s just her sense of humor,” meaning that’s just her way of being funny.  “She doesn’t mean anything by it.” If you say someone “doesn’t mean (mean) any thing by it,” you mean that the person isn’t trying to be hurtful, isn’t trying  to be mean, isn’t trying to hurt your feelings. Usually we use this phrase when someone s ays something that is hurtful to someone else and you are saying that the  person didn’t have that intention, didn’t have that desire to hurt you.  

Carla says that her mother likes Marc. Marc says, “ She has a strange way of showing it.” That expression – he or she “has a str ange way of showing it” – means that you think the person’s actions aren’t ma tching the person’s intentions or desires, or perhaps you’re saying that you don’t  really believe the person doesn’t mean it. You think the person was trying to  be cruel or mean.  

If you see someone, for example, I don’t know, alwa ys kicking cats, and that person says, “Oh, actually I love cats,” you might say, “Well you have a strange way of showing it.” If you really love cats, that i s, you wouldn’t kick them all the time. Marc says his mother-in-law has a strange way  of showing that she likes him, because she’s always criticizing him. Carla th en says, “All of this talk about mothers-in-law is getting our blood up.”  

“Mothers-in-law” is the plural of “mother-in-law.” You might think you would add the “s” at the end of this term – you might think t he plural would be “mother-in- laws” – and in fact, in conversational English many  people probably would say that, including native speakers. But technically, t he plural of “mother-in-law” is “mothers-in-law.” You put the “s” after the word “m other,” not after the word “law.” Carla says, “All this talk about,” meaning this con versation that we’re having about, “mothers-in-law is getting our blood up.” “T o get your blood up” means to become upset or angry about something.  

Carla says, “At this rate,” meaning if we continue doing this, “we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve rece ived so far.” Carla says if we continue talking about our mothers-in-law, we won’t  be able to follow another piece of advice, another suggestion, that we’ve rec eived about married life. Marc says, “Which was?” meaning, “What was that piece of  advice? What was that suggestion?” Carla says, “Don’t go to bed angry.”  

This is an old piece of advice for people who are m arried. “Don’t go to bed angry” means resolve your fight or find a solution to the problem you’re having before you go to sleep, otherwise you’ll continue thinking  about it and most likely continue the argument the next day. This is usually  good advice, I think. Sometimes there are problems, of course, that are s mall and that, if you go to  

 sleep and wake up the next day, you’ve forgotten ab out or you realize they are no longer very important – certainly not worth figh ting about.  

However, there are some problems that you are proba bly best advised to resolve before going to sleep. Here I am giving you advice about your marriage. Well, I have been married for, oh, what, 18 years. So, here  in Los Angeles that’s considered a really long time. I mean, most people here in Los Angeles, especially celebrities, they marry for like, what, five years? three years? two years? – something like that  

Back to our dialogue, Carla says, “Don’t go to bed angry.” That’s the piece of advice. Marc says, “Who’s angry?” Perhaps Marc is s aying here that he doesn’t think he has gotten angry over this, or perhaps he’ s agreeing with Carla. He’s saying, “Yeah, I’m not angry if you’re not angry. L et’s forget about it.  

Now listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.
