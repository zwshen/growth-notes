This episode is a dialogue between a mother and her  son about keeping fit – about being healthy and having a healthy body. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Hold it right there. Put that candy bar down.

Justin: Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.

Mom: Don’t you remember what Dad said about this fa mily’s need to improve our level of fitness?

Justin: Only old people have to worry about getting  fat.

Mom: It’s not just about getting fat.

Justin: But I’m just a kid. I’m in great shape.

Mom: Childhood obesity is a huge problem in this co untry. Even if you’re not overweight, people your age lead sedentary lives.

Justin: Whatever that means.

Mom: It means that you sit around all day as couch potatoes watching TV and playing video games. In my day, kids went outside t o ride their bikes, climb trees, and run around.

Justin: I don’t have that kind of energy.

Mom: Precisely! You and your brothers are lethargic  because you don’t get enough exercise.

Justin: But exercise is tiring.

Mom: That’s because you’re not fit. You have no sta mina or endurance.

Justin: I don’t need endurance.

Mom: Stop grumbling. It’s Saturday and you boys sho uld be outside getting some fresh air.

Justin: In Los Angeles?

Mom: Are you smart mouthing me, young man? Get outs ide or you’ll all be helping me clean the house.

Justin: We’re out of here!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the mother saying to the s on, whose name is Justin, “Hold it right there.” “Hold it right there” is a p hrase we use when we want someone to stop doing what he or she is doing. Usua lly it’s a phrase used by someone in authority, such as a parent, or perhaps a police officer. If the police officer says to you, “Hold it right there,” he or s he means you should stop doing what you’re doing and don’t move. Mom is telling Ju stin to hold it right there – to stop what he is doing.

She tells him, “Put that candy bar down.” “To put s omething down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to take it and put it on a tab le or on the floor – to remove it from your hand. A “candy bar” is, of course, a kind  of sweet that is popular with children. Justin says, “Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.” A “snack” (snack) is a small piece of food in between your ma in meals. “To tide (tide) someone over” is a phrasal verb meaning to give som eone enough resources – energy, money, food – in order to survive or last u ntil some future point at which they will get more money, energy, or food.

If you say to someone, “I need twenty dollars to ti de me over until the end of the week when I get paid at my job,” you are asking the  person for money that you can use until some point in the future – in this ca se, until the end of the week, when you will get more money.

 Mom, however, says to Justin, “Don’t you remember w hat dad said about this family’s need to improve our level of fitness?” The  mother is reminding Justin of something that his father said about the entire fam ily needing to improve their “level of fitness” (fitness). “Fitness” refers to y our physical health – whether you can walk up the stairs without running out of breat h, for example. “Fitness” refers to the physical health, the bodily health of a pers on.

Justin says, “Only old people have to worry about g etting fat.” Justin associates fitness with whether you are fat (whether you weigh  too much) or thin (whether you don’t weigh a lot). Mom says, “It’s not just ab out getting fat.” In other words, fitness is not just related to how much you weigh. Justin says, “But I’m a kid” – that is, I’m a child. “I’m in great shape.” “Shape”  (shape) here refers to your physical condition, your physical fitness.

If you’re in good shape, or as Justin describes him self, “great shape,” you are very physically fit, you are very healthy. Your bod y is “in good condition,” we might say. If you are in “bad shape,” your body is not in good condition. We can describe physical objects as being in good shape or  bad shape as well. When we do that, we’re not referring, of course, to the hea lth of the object, but rather to whether the object is in good condition or in poor condition.

Mom, however, says that “childhood obesity is a hug e problem in this country.” “Obesity” (obesity) relates to the condition of bei ng seriously overweight – not just being a little heavier, weighing a little more  than you should, but weighing a lot more than you should, such that it affects your  health. It could actually kill you or make you have a lot of physical problems. It’s s ort of strange because Mom just finished saying that fitness is not about gett ing fat, and then she goes on to talk about getting fat (“childhood obesity” – that is, children being overweight.)

“Even if you’re not overweight,” Mom says, “people your age lead sedentary lives.” “Sedentary” (sedentary) here means not movi ng very much, sitting around. When someone says they live a “sedentary life,” he means he doesn’t do a lot of exercise. He watches a lot of television, perhaps. He sits in his chair and reads or surfs the Internet, but he’s not out doing physical  activity. Mom is saying that children nowadays lead sedentary lives. They don’t go out and move and are not as physically active as perhaps they once were.

Justin, however, says, “Whatever that means.” In ot her words, Justin doesn’t understand what his mother just said. He doesn’t pe rhaps understand the word “sedentary.” Mom explains, “It means that you sit a round all day as couch potatoes watching TV and playing video games.” The term “couch” (couch) refers

to a sofa, something that you sit on – a chair for two or more people, we could also describe it as being. A “potato” is a kind of vegetable, a white vegetable – at least, when you cut it open, it’s white. A “couch p otato,” however, is a term referring to someone who’s lazy, who doesn’t move a round very much.

Mom explains, “In my day, kids went outside to ride  their bikes, climb trees, and run around.” Mom is comparing the situation when sh e was a child to today’s situation where children don’t go around climbing t rees and running around, at least not in this dialogue. Justin says, “I don’t h ave that kind of energy.” “Energy” (energy) here means strength. “To have the energy” to do something is to have the physical strength or the physical ability to do  something. Justin says he doesn’t have energy to do the things his mother is talking about.

Mom responds, “Precisely” (precisely). The term “pr ecisely” here means exactly. “That’s exactly what I’m saying,” Mom is indicating  with this term “precisely.” “You and your brothers are lethargic because you don’t g et enough exercise.” “To be lethargic” (lethargic) means to not have a lot of e nergy, to not move around, perhaps to be lazy. Mom says that her children are lethargic because they don’t get enough “exercise” (exercise).

The term “exercise” here refers to physical activit y. Going out and playing a game or running or riding a bicycle – all of these are forms of exercise, physical activity that’s good for your body. Mom says, “That ’s because you’re not fit.” “To be fit” (fit) means to be in good shape. Mom says, “You have no stamina or endurance.” “Stamina” (stamina) is the ability to d o something that is challenging, that requires a lot of energy, for a long time. If you run a marathon, a long race, you need a lot of stamina. You need a lot of energy , a lot of strength, to complete the marathon.

“Endurance” (endurance) is the ability to do someth ing that is very challenging although it doesn’t necessarily have to be somethin g physically challenging. When we talk about “stamina,” we’re usually talking  about your physical energy or strength. “Endurance” could relate to that also,  could refer to that also, but it may also be used in a wider context to refer to you r ability and what we might call “willpower” – not to give up when the situation is difficult. Justin says, “I don’t need endurance.”

Mom, however, responds, “Stop grumbling.” “To grumb le” (grumble) means to complain, usually in a low, soft, or quiet voice. I f your wife tells you to do the dishes, and you respond by saying, “Alright, I’ll d o the dishes . . .” you’re not happy, you’re complaining, but you’re not complaini ng very loudly – at least, I

don’t when my wife tells me to do the dishes. Mom s ays, “It’s Saturday and you boys should be outside getting some fresh air.”

Justin says, “In Los Angeles?” He’s making fun of h is mother in a way. He’s saying that Los Angeles – because it so polluted, b ecause the air is not very clean – is not a good place to get fresh air. The m other, however, is not happy with Justin. She says, “Are you smart mouthing me, young man?” “To smart (smart) mouth (mouth)” someone is to speak to someo ne disrespectfully, especially someone in authority, such as your mothe r or your boss. Usually it’s a term we use when children are talking back to their  parents in a disrespectful way, trying to be funny when they shouldn’t be.

Mom says, “Get outside or you’ll all be helping me clean the house.” So, Mom is telling Justin that if he doesn’t go outside right now, he and his brothers are going to be helping her clean inside the house. Justin re sponds, “We’re out of here.” The expression “to be out (out) of here” means that  we are leaving right now. It’s often used when you’re in an unpleasant or uncomfor table situation that you want to leave right away. It’s an informal expression.

You might, for example, be having an argument with your girlfriend, and your girlfriend says something or demands something of y ou and you don’t want to do it. You might say, “I’m out of here,” meaning I’m l eaving. However, it’s a very serious thing to say in that situation. You might b e saying, “I want to break up with you,” or you might be saying that you want to end the relationship. It normally is less serious than that, however. It nor mally means that you are leaving.

Sometimes it could mean simply that you are going t o leave without any sense that the current situation is a bad one. Someone ma y end a meeting by saying, “Okay, well, I have another appointment, so I’m out  of here” – I’m leaving here right now.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
