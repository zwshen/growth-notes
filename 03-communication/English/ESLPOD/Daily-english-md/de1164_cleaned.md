This episode is a dialogue between Alice and Dilber t about making changes, physical changes, to an office. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Alice: I can’t hear you over that hammering. When a re these renovations going to be done? 

Dilbert: They’re already two weeks past the schedul ed completion date and I can only guess at the cost overruns. 

Alice: It feels like they’re never going to finish.  

Dilbert: I know. When the renovations were announce d, I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.  

Alice: Me, too. 

Dilbert: The upgrades sounded good – new lighting f ixtures, flooring, and sound- deadening walls and ceilings.  

Alice: I was looking forward to an updated look wit h new built-ins. This old furniture shows lots of wear and tear.  

Dilbert: Yeah, now all I want is to be rid of all t his dust. Who can work with this racket?  

 Alice: Heh? What did you say? Did you say you can’t  hack it? Me, neither!

Alice says to Dilbert, “I can’t hear you over that hammering.” “To be able to hear someone over” (over) something means to be able to hear someone despite noise that is in the background that you are also h earing. “Hammering” (hammering) comes from the verb “to hammer.” “To ha mmer” means to take an object – called, interestingly enough, a “hammer” –  and hit another object, usually a small piece of metal called a “nail” (nai l).  

We use a hammer to put nails into wood or other sur faces, other materials. “Hammering” is the sound that you get when you use a hammer. We often use hammers when we’re putting something together or bu ilding something. When Alice says she can’t hear Dilbert “over that hammer ing,” she means the hammering is so loud she cannot hear Dilbert talkin g.  

She says, “When are these renovations going to be d one?” When are they going to be finished? “Renovations” (renovations) are cha nges to the appearance of a room or a building, usually changes that require ta king a wall down, or perhaps putting a new wall up, changing the floors – these are examples of renovations that might take place inside of a building or a roo m.  

Dilbert says, “They’re already two weeks past the s cheduled completion date.” “They” in this case are the people who are making t he renovations. These people are “already two weeks past the scheduled completio n date.” The “completion date” would be the date when something is supposed to be finished, when something is supposed to be completed.  

Dilbert says, “I can only guess at the cost overrun s.” “To guess at” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to estimate the amoun t or size of something based upon the information that you have. When Dilb ert says he can “only guess at the cost overruns,” he means he estimates or exp ects that the price of this delay in completing the project is going to be high . It’s going to be great.  

“Cost overruns” (overruns) refer to the amount of m oney you have to spend, the expenses of a project, that are more than what you anticipated, more than what was planned. If you have ever done any renovations on your house or apartment, you know that usually they end up costing more than  what you expected or what the person doing the renovations told you they woul d cost.  

Alice says, “It feels like they’re never going to f inish.” Dilbert responds, “I know. When the renovations were announced” – that is, whe n they were told that they were going to have these renovations – “I was glad to hear that the office would be reconfigured for better use.” “To reconfigure” ( reconfigure) something means to design it in a way that is new – to, we may say,  “redesign” it or “reorganize” something.  

The offices were Dilbert works are being “reconfigu red for better use,” meaning they’re changing things around so that the office i s more efficient, perhaps. Alice says she was happy to hear the offices were going t o be reconfigured also. That’s why she says, “Me, too.” “Me, too” is an inf ormal way of saying “I agree” or “I also believe that.” Dilbert says, “The upgrades sounded good.” “Upgrades” (upgrades) are improvements in something – in this case, improvements in the office and the way that the office is configured.  

Dilbert says that some of these upgrades include “n ew lighting fixtures and sound-deadening walls and ceilings.” “Lighting fixt ures” (fixtures) simply refers to the lamps and bulbs that are attached to the walls and the ceilings that are part of the room. A “fixture” is something usually that is permanently attached to a wall or a ceiling. A “ceiling” (ceiling) is the top  of a room. A room has a “floor” (floor) on the bottom, “walls” on the side, and a “ ceiling” on top.  

Dilbert says the lighting fixtures were going to be  changed or upgraded, as was the flooring. The “flooring” refers of course to th e kind of surface that is on the floor. Some rooms, such as the room I’m standing in  now, have wooden flooring. Some rooms have carpet as flooring. Dilbert says th e upgrades also include “sound-deadening walls and ceilings.” Something tha t is “sound-deadening” (deadening) is something that reduces the amount of  noise in a room, usually by making the room quieter.  

Alice says, “I was looking forward to the updated l ook with new built-ins.” “Updated” means more modern – something that is imp roved, something that is better. “Built -ins” are shelves, cabinets, and oth er pieces of furniture that are permanently attached to the walls – that is, they a ren’t things you can move around.  

For example, in some rooms there are “built-in cabi nets” – things that you use for storage, things that you use to put things into. A built-in cabinet would be an example of a “built-in” – something that is put in to a room that is usually permanently attached to the ceiling or the floor or  the wall or all three.  

Alice says, “This old furniture shows lots of wear and tear.” “To show” here means that you can see it. It is easily noticed. “W ear (wear) and tear (tear)” is an expression referring to the damage that occurs slow ly over time as things get used. So, if you have, for example, a chair in your  room, an old chair that has been there many years, it probably shows a little “ wear and tear” – that is, you can see that it’s old; perhaps it’s changed its col or or there are parts of the chair that need repairing. 

Dilbert says, “Yeah, now all I want is to be rid of  all this dust.” To be rid (rid) of” something means to no longer have something, to be free of something that is bothering you or that you don’t like. In this case,  Dilbert doesn’t like all of the “dust” (dust). “Dust” usually refers to very small pieces of dirt or other particles, I guess we would call them, that collect on the floor  or on a piece of furniture.  

If you go away from your house for a couple of mont hs and you return, there will probably be dust on the tables. You can put your ha nd on the table and move your fingers across the table, and when you lift yo ur hand up, it will have dust on it – those little small pieces of dirt that collect  on, say, a piece of furniture. When you build something, or when you renovate something , there is also a lot of dust when they take down the walls or remove the ceiling s. Dust will also be present in those situations.  

Dilbert then says, “Who can work with this racket?”  “Racket” (racket) here refers to a lot of noise, especially constant noise – nois e caused, for example, by construction or renovation. A mother might say to h er son, “Turn down your radio. I don’t want to hear all of that racket.” Th e mother is referring to probably her son’s music, which to her sounds just like nois e or racket.  

As a noun, “racket” can also be used to describe wh at you use to play certain sporting games such as tennis and badminton. Those sports also use “rackets” – things that you hold in your hand to hit the ball o r the object that is used in the game. I think in badminton, in English we call it a  “birdie” (birdie). Well, that’s what we called it when we were kids. I think the te chnical name is something like “shuttlecock.” You don’t need to know that, unless you play badminton, of course.  

It’s so loud, however, that Alice can’t hear Dilber t. She says, “Heh? What did you say? Did you say you can’t hack it? Me, neither!” “ To not be able to hack” (hack) something means you’re unable to do something. Dilb ert actually says the word “racket,” but Alice thinks he’s saying something el se. Because of all the noise, she can’t hear him properly. She thinks he said tha t he “can’t hack it,” meaning he can’t work. He can’t do anything because of all of this noise. He’s unable to perform his job.   

 She agrees with him, even though that’s not what he  said. She says, “Me, neither!” meaning “I can’t either.” Once again, not ice that this is an informal way of saying “I don’t either” in English. We’ll often say, in normal conversation, “Me, neither,” even though your grammar book may say tha t that’s not correct.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
