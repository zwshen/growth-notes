# Introducing Yourself

Welcome to Daily English 1 – Introducing Yourself.

This is Daily English number 1. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beau tiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a story about me, introducing vocab ulary you need to talk about yourself. Let’s get started. > Let me tell you a little about myself.
> I was born and raised in Minnesota and I’m a native  of the city of Saint Paul. I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers  and two sisters. I’m the eleventh child, so you could say I’m the baby of the family, but I swear I wasn’t spoiled.
> That’s right, I’m part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood, perhaps the biggest family in the sta te!
> I had a happy childhood, for the most part. My fath er and mother didn’t have a lot of money, but because they both worked hard, we nev er felt deprived.
> I wasn’t much interested in sports, like my brother s were. I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up. I went to grad e school near my house, and then to high school about two miles away from our h ome.

After teaching hi gh school for a few years, I was offered a job in California, so I moved to Los Angeles in 1991. After working here for a few years, I went back to school (again! ) to get my Ph.D. I was starting to become a professional student.

>  Well, I completed my Ph.D. in four years and then t aught at the university for several years. Now I work at a small research organ ization here in Los Angeles. I am happily married, and I still enjoy reading and l istening to music, and of course, creating ESLPod.com lessons.

Our story begins by me saying, “Let me tell you a l ittle about myself.” I’m going to give you some information about me. I start by sayi ng, “I was born and raised in Minnesota.” “To be born” (born) means, of course, to come out of your mother, to be separated from your mother’s body. “To be raised ” (raised) means to be cared for as a child until you are an adult. We might als o use the phrasal verb “to be brought (brought) up.” You may, for example, be “bo rn” in one city and “raised” in another, if your parents moved soon after you were born.

In the story I say, “I was born and raised in Minne sota.” Minnesota is a state in the north-central part of the U.S. on the border of  Canada. I continue by saying that I am a “native” (native) of the city of St. Pa ul. A “native” is a person born in a specific place. I am a native of St. Paul because t hat’s the city where I was born. I could also say, “I’m a native of Minnesota,” beca use I was born in the state of Minnesota. I could say, “I’m a native of the United  States,” because I was born in the United States. So, depending on what place you want to use, you can say you are a “native” of that particular place.

Well, I was a native of St. Paul. I grew up there w ith my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters. I say then, “I am the ele venth child, so you could say” – that is, you could call me – “the baby of the famil y.” The “baby” (baby) here means the youngest person in the family, or the you ngest child of your parents. We call that person “the baby of the family.” The w ord “baby” usually refers to a child from the time he is born until maybe two or t hree years old, but if someone says, “he’s the baby of the family” or “she’s the b aby of the family,” he means that person is the youngest of the family. We would  say the youngest “sibling” (sibling). Your “siblings” are your brothers and si sters.

Now, in many families, the baby of the family is “s poiled.” “To be spoiled” (spoiled) is to get whatever you want and often to not behave very well, especially if you’re a child. If parents spoil thei r children, the children get whatever they want, and because of that, they often  don’t behave or act like they should. They don’t act politely. Well, I was not sp oiled even though I was the youngest, or baby of the family.

Daily English 1 – Introducing Yourself

 “That’s right,” I say, “I’m part of a big family, p robably the biggest family in the neighborhood.” A “neighborhood” is an area inside of the city where you live. Most cities have several neighborhoods or areas. I say that “I had a happy childhood.” Your “childhood” (childhood) refers to the period during which you were growing up, from the time you were a baby unti l you became an adult or perhaps a teenager – 13, 14, and so forth. That’s y our “childhood.” Some people have a happy childhood. Some people have a sad chil dhood.

I say that my childhood was happy “for the most par t.” That expression “for the most part” means mainly or in most cases – or in th is case, perhaps the majority of the time. Sometimes, of course, my childhood was  not happy, but usually it was. I explain that my mother and father “did not h ave a lot of money” – they were not rich – “but they both worked hard,” meanin g they worked a lot. Because they worked a lot, they had enough money to give us  what we needed as children. Therefore, or because of that, we never, I say, “felt deprived” (deprived). “To feel deprived” means to not have everything you  need to be happy, not have the things that you want to have in order to have a  good life.

I say that “I wasn’t much interested in sports.” I didn’t like playing sports, but my brothers did. I instead “enjoyed reading and listen ing to music while growing up.” I say that “I went to grade school near my house.” “Grade (grade) school” is also called, in the U.S., “elementary school.” It’s the first five to eight years of a child’s education, depending on the school. Sometimes these  are also called, in certain areas, “grammar school,” although that isn’t a term  as commonly used now as it was, say, 50 years ago. We usually refer to grade s chools as elementary schools, nowadays.

I then went on to high school, which in the U.S. is  normally grades 9 through 12, though it might be grades 10 through 12 depending o n the school system. My high school was grades 9 through 12. “After graduat ing” – that is, after completing high school – “I went on to the Universi ty of Minnesota for my bachelor’s degree.” “To go on to” means to move to the next level – in this case, the next level of my education, which was college o r the university. I went to the University of Minnesota for my “bachelor’s (bachelo r’s) degree (degree).” A “degree” is a certificate or recognition of study a t a certain school. A “bachelor’s degree” is given after typically four years of stud y at a college or university.

I say that, “It took me a while” – that is, a long time – “to learn the ropes (ropes) at the university.” The expression “to learn the ro pes” is an idiom meaning to learn how things are done in a certain group or org anization, or to learn how to

Daily English 1 – Introducing Yourself

do a certain kind of job. In this case, I was learn ing how things worked at the university. I say that “I finally graduated,” or co mpleted my studies, “about six years later.” That is, instead of taking the normal  four years at university, I took six years because, well, I’m just not very smart.

I then say, “Better late than never.” The expressio n “Better late than never” means it is better to do something, even if you don ’t do it quickly, as long as you are able to complete it or finish it. So, my father  used to say, “Better late than never” about my university studies because it took me so long to finish, but I did in fact finish. Well, at least my bachelor’s degree . “I then went to Mexico for a couple of years to teach English and to study Spani sh.”

“When I returned, I decided to become a teacher, so  I went back to school” – that is, I returned to the university – “to get my maste r’s degree.” A “master’s (master’s) degree” is a one, sometimes two-year deg ree that is given for studying about a certain topic after you complete your bache lor’s, or typically four-year, degree. A “bachelor’s degree” is sometimes called a n “undergraduate degree,” and a “master’s degree” is a graduate degree.

There are actually two graduate degrees that are co mmon. One is a “master’s degree,” done immediately after or at least at some  point after finishing your bachelor’s degree. There’s also a “doctoral” or “do ctorate degree.” That takes longer. There are many different kinds of graduate degrees, however, but “master’s” and “doctorate,” which we also call a “P h.D.,” are the most common graduate degrees.

“After teaching high school,” I say, “I was offered  a job in California,” which is true, “and I moved here in 1991. After working here  for a few years, I went back to school again to get my Ph.D.” A “Ph.D.,” as I me ntioned, is a graduate degree. It usually takes somewhere between four and seven y ears to complete. After you get your Ph.D., you can be called “Doctor.” “I star ted becoming a professional student,” I say.

I then finish by saying that “I completed my Ph.D. in four years and then taught at the university for several years.” I taught at a co uple of different colleges after I got my Ph.D. “Now I work at a small research organi zation.” “Research” (research) is used to describe efforts to learn mor e about something, either in a scientific or other disciplined way. I work at a re search organization here in Los Angeles.

Daily English 1 – Introducing Yourself

I say, “I am happily married.” “To be married” (mar ried) means to have a husband or a wife. “I am happily married, and I still enjoy  reading and listening to music, as well as, of course, making these ESLPod.com less ons.”

Now let’s listen to the story again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of story]

Let me tell you a little about myself.

I was born and raised in Minnesota and I’m a native  of the city of Saint Paul. I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers  and two sisters. I’m the eleventh child so you could say I’m the baby of the  family, but I swear I wasn’t spoiled.

That’s right, I’m part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood, perhaps the biggest family in the sta te!

I had a happy childhood, for the most part. My fath er and mother didn’t have a lot of money, but because they both worked hard, we nev er felt deprived.

I wasn’t much interested in sports, like my brother s were. I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up. I went to grad e school near my house, and then to high school about two miles away from our h ome.

After graduating from high school, I went on to the  University of Minnesota for my bachelor’s degree. It took me a while to learn the ropes at the university, but I finally graduated about six years later. Better lat e than never, as my father used to say.

I then went to Mexico for a couple of years to teac h English and to study Spanish. When I returned, I decided to become a tea cher, so I went back to school to get my master’s degree. After teaching hi gh school for a few years, I was offered a job in California, so I moved to Los Angeles in 1991. After working here for a few years, I went back to school (again! ) to get my Ph.D. I was starting to become a professional student.

Well, I completed my Ph.D. in four years and then t aught at the university for several years. Now I work at a small research organ ization here in Los Angeles. I am happily married, and I still enjoy reading and l istening to music, and of course, creating ESLPod.com lessons.

# Getting Up

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 2: Getting Up

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number two. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode begins a special 10-part series coveri ng basic vocabulary for everyday actions, from getting up in the morning to  going to bed at night and everything in between.  We’ll start with getting up .

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

The worst part of the day for me is definitely when  I have to get up.  Waking up, that I can handle.  But getting up?  That, I hate.  The covers I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a comforter as wel l as a light blanket.  I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have differ ent color pillowcases.  Well, at least the sheets match.

I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off.  I l ike to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarr ing.  My old roommate used to like the terrible buzzer that you find on most alar m clocks nowadays, which always used to drive me nuts.  As I was saying, is ometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the ho use—a car door slamming, an alarm going off, gunfire—well, okay, not gunfire , but man, is my neighborhood noisy!  Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’ s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than set the alarm.

I’m not really an early riser, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world. I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor  at a time.  Every once in awhile I’ll oversleep, but not too often.  I really love the weekends, when I can sleep in.

[End of story]

Our story begins by me describing how much I do not  like getting up.  To get up means to get out of your bed, to stand up after you  have been lying down on a bed.  I say that, “The worst part of my day is when  I have to get up.  Waking up, that I can handle.”  To wake up “wake up” (two word s) means that you are

sleeping and you stop sleeping and now you are awak e.  The verb is to wake up. So, you can wake up while you are in bed, and then,  you get up—you stand up after lying down.

I said that “waking up” is something “I can handle. ”  To handle (handle) here means to be able to control—something that I can ma nage—something that I can accept; it's not a problem.  Another expression wou ld be something I can deal with.  To deal “deal” with something is the same, i n this case, as to be able to handle something.

I say that “getting up” is something that “I hate.”   The covers I have on my bed are heavy.”  The covers (covers) are the things tha t you put over you to keep you warm.  Usually, the covers include a blanket, somet imes a comforter and usually, what we would call the top sheet or flat sheet.  A comforter “comforter” is a very thick blanket, a very heavy blanket.  A blanket (bl anket) is something that you put over you when you are sleeping to keep you warm.

Blanket is a general term; a comforter is a kind of  blanket, a heavy blanket.  The opposite of a comforter would be a light blanket.  A light (light) blanket would be the opposite, and that is a blanket that will keep you warm, but if it gets very cold, it might not keep you warm, it might not be suffici ent.

So, we have a comforter and we have a light blanket .  Usually, there is a top sheet (sheet) that you put over you in between your  body and the blankets, and this top sheet is sometimes called a flat sheet.  T he sheet that goes on the bed itself, that goes onto the corners of the bed, that 's called a fitted sheet, a fitted (fitted) sheet.  So, we have a fitted sheet on the bed that you sleep on top of, then we have a top sheet and then a blanket, someti mes, if it's very cold, a comforter as well.

I say in the story that “I sleep with two pillows.”   A pillow (pillow) is what you put your head on when you sleep.  Now, “for some reason ,” I say I “have different colored pillowcases.”  This is true, actually; I ha ve a black pillowcase and a blue pillowcase for my two pillows.  I think the reason is I am too lazy to go and buy a new pillowcase.

Well, the pillowcase “pillowcase” (one word) is the  thing that you put over the pillow so the pillow doesn't get dirty; we call tha t the pillowcase.  I say, “Well, at least the sheets match.”  We already know what a sh eet is.  When we say the sheets match (match), we mean that they are the sam e color or two colors that

look good together.  We use that verb, to match, wh en we are talking about clothing as well, or anything where you have two co lors.

“I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off.”  W hen we say the alarm “goes off,” we mean that the alarm starts to make a sound .  Your alarm (alarm) is a machine that makes noise at a certain time; usually  it has a clock.  Well, I sometimes wake up before my alarm makes noise, my a larm goes off.  “I like to keep the alarm at a low volume,” meaning not very l oud – at a low volume – “with some classical music, nothing too jarring.”  When w e say a sound is jarring (jarring), we mean that it is loud and it causes yo u to jump or to be surprised.  It's something that is not very nice, not very pleasant.   A jarring noise would be one that bothers you, perhaps because it is very loud o r it is not a very nice sound. So, I don't want my alarm to have a jarring noise; instead, I play classical music.

Now, “My old roommate”—the person I used to share a n apartment with— “used to like the terrible buzzer you find on most alarm clocks.”  This, again, is true.  I had a roommate that had a very loud and bad soundin g buzzer; it was a terrible buzzer.  The buzzer (buzzer) is when the alarm cloc k doesn't play music, but it just plays a sound.  Sometimes it is like a bell ri nging; that's the buzzer.  Well, this buzzer always used to drive me nuts.  “To driv e someone nuts” (nuts) means to drive them crazy, to make them crazy, to make th em go crazy.

I continue the story by saying, “As I was saying.”  We use that expression, “as I was saying,” when we are talking about one thing th en we start talking about a second thing, and now we want to go back and talk a bout the first thing again. So, when you interrupt yourself when you are talkin g, and then you change the topic, change what you are talking about, and then want to go back to your original topic, you say, “As I was saying.”

“As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the al arm, usually because of some noise outside the house.”  When we say there is some noise, some sound, outside the house or outside of the house - you can  say either one - we mean that someone is making a noise that is very loud.  Some of those noises are “a car door slamming.”  The verb “to slam” (slam) mean s that you close the door usually very quickly and you make a loud noise.  So meone closes their car door very fast, it will make a noise. We call that “slam ming the door.”

My mother always used to tell me when I was young, “Don't slam the doors,” meaning when I come in and close the door, I should  close it slowly and quietly. Of course, I was not a good boy so I would sometime s slam the door.

As I was saying, an alarm goes off, that's another noise that can wake you up outside and this would be a car alarm.  Here in Los  Angeles, everyone has a car alarm, and sometimes those alarms go off at night.  Another noise is gunfire; “gun (gun) fire (fire).”  Gunfire is when someone s hoots a gun and it makes a noise.  This is, again, Los Angeles, so we sometime s have gunfire - but of course, I'm joking.  I say, “Well, okay, not gunfir e,” meaning I'm just kidding, that isn't actually true, although, it is  true sometimes.

I then say, “Man, is my neighborhood noisy!”  That expression, “man,” is just a way of expressing your emotion when you are saying something that you really mean or really want to emphasize.  “Man, is my neig hborhood noisy!” - that means my neighborhood is very noisy.

“Of course, when I'm staying at a hotel, it’s usual ly easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel.”  A “wake up call” (call) is w hen the hotel calls you on the phone to wake you up so you don't have to set your own alarm.  “To set” (set) an alarm means to turn it on and to put a certain time  that you want to get up.  Well, sometimes people have problems with their alarm clo cks and so, if they are in a hotel, they can ask the hotel to wake them up with a wake up call.

At the end of the story I say, “I’m not really an e arly riser.”  An “early (early) riser (riser)” means someone who wakes up and gets up ver y early in the morning. You could be an early riser; you could be a late ri ser.  The word “riser” comes from the verb “to rise (rise)” which, in this case,  means to get up.  Well, “I'm not really an early riser,” I say, “so I don’t jump out  of bed.”  “To jump out of bed” means to get out of bed very quickly.  “I don’t jum p out of bed ready to take on the world.”  “To take on the world,” means I'm read y for the day.  It's an expression we use to say that I am ready to go out into the world and do my best. “I'm not an early riser, I don't jump out of bed re ady to take on the world.” Instead, “I get up very slowly, usually one foot on  the floor at a time.”  So first, I get up and I put one foot on the floor, and then an other foot on the floor, and then I stand up.

“Every once in awhile,” I say, “I’ll oversleep.”  “ To oversleep” (oversleep) – one word – means that you sleep later than you should.  For example, you are wanting to get up at seven o'clock in the morning a nd you sleep until 7:30.  You don't realize that you are sleeping too late; we ca ll that “oversleeping.”  To oversleep means you sleep longer than you wanted to .

At the end of the story I say, “I really love the w eekends” – Fridays and Saturdays – “when I can sleep in.”  “To sleep in” m eans that you don't get up at

your normal time; you sleep longer than you normall y do.  So, if you normally get up at seven, on Saturday or Sunday if you don't wor k, you may sleep in until nine a.m.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a nativ e rate of speech.

[Start of story]

The worst part of the day for me is definitely when  I have to get up.  Waking up, that I can handle.  But getting up?  That, I hate.  The covers I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a comforter as wel l as a light blanket.  I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have differ ent color pillowcases.  Well, at least the sheets match.

I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off.  I l ike to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarr ing.  My old roommate used to like the terrible buzzer that you find on most alar m clocks nowadays, which always used to drive me nuts.  As I was saying, is ometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the ho use—a car door slamming, an alarm going off, gunfire—well, okay, not gunfire , but man, is my neighborhood noisy!  Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’ s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than to set the alarm.

I’m not really an early riser, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world. I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor  at a time.  Every once in awhile I’ll oversleep, but not too often.  I really love the weekends, when I can sleep in.

[End of story]

Her scripts are never jarring, but always as wonder ful as classical music.  I speak, of course, of our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse . Thank you, Lucy!

# Cleaning Up

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 3: Cleaning Up

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number three. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, the second of our 10-part special series on daily English, I’ll talk about getting cleaned up in the morning to go to wo rk.

Let’s get started!

 [Start of story] I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a.m. My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The toi let is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup,  swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit. Not pleasant, but necess ary. Then I get out the floss. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush a nd the toothpaste. I brush and then it’s off to the shower. I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub,  and pull the curtain back. I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the  perfect temperature. I lather up with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off. Now it’s shaving time. I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn’t shave close enough. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up wit h shaving cream, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the disposable b lades in the trash. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to breakfast. [End of story] In this episode, we are “Cleaning Up,” or making ou rselves clean. “I go into my bathroom,” I begin the story, “someti me around 6:45 a.m.” Notice that we say a.m., but you could also say “in the mo rning.” 6:45 is also the same as quarter to seven. “My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom.” In your bathroom and in your ki tchen there is usually a sink and a faucet. The faucet “faucet” is where the wate r comes out, and normally you have hot water and cold water. The sink is where the water goes into. Usually, it is a round or a square white bowl, really, that has  a hole at the bottom and we

call that hole the drain (drain). That's where the water goes down into the pipe, it's where the water goes out of the sink. If you want to fill your sink with water, you usually have to stop the drain. “To stop a drai n” means to put something over it so that the water doesn't go down. So, we have a faucet and we have a sink, and in you r bathroom, you often have a small box, sometimes with a mirror on it so you can see yourself, that we call the medicine cabinet. A “cabinet” (cabinet) is like  a small box where you put things, but it's a box that hangs on the wall; it is attached to the wall. You can have cabinets in your kitchen, where you put your d ishes. So, they're containers, they're things that you used to put and store or ke ep things. A medicine cabinet is a place where you have medici ne, but also, it's a place where you put your other things that you use in the  bathroom - things like mouthwash, shaving cream, razors, and so forth. We' ll talk about those in a second. So that's your medicine cabinet. In my bathroom, the “sink and the medicine cabinet are on the left” side when you walk into the bathroom; the toilet is next to t hat. “The toilet” (toilet) is what you use to go to the bathroom, what you use to get rid of things from your body, we might say. When you are done using the toilet, y ou then flush the toilet. The verb, “to flush” (flush) is when you get rid of wha t's inside the toilet after you're done using it, usually with water. There is a tub in my bathroom. A “tub” (tub) someti mes called a bathtub, is where you can take a bath. You can fill the tub up with w ater and you can get into the water. “Anyway,” I say in the story, “I turn on the lights .” Notice the use of the word “anyway.” It's very common in English to use that w ord when you want to get back to something you were talking about before. We  can also say, “As I was saying,” it means something similar here. “Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet.” The “mouthwash” (mouthwash) – all one wor d – is a liquid like water, but it has something in it that helps clean your te eth, clean the inside of your mouth; that is mouthwash. So, you take the mouthwas h and you “pour a small amount into a cup.” The mouthwash usually comes in,  or is in, a bottle. This bottle, you take and you pour some mouthwash into a  cup. To pour means to take something that is liquid, like water or mouthw ash, and put it somewhere else. In this case, it's into a small cup.

After I put it into the cup, I “swish it around for  30 seconds.” “To swish (swish) something around” means to move it around, and we u se that verb usually when talking about something that is liquid like water o r mouthwash that you move back and forth very quickly. So, when you put the m outhwash in your mouth, usually you take your sides of your mouth, what we would call your “cheeks” (cheeks), your cheeks, and you move them back and f orth, so that the mouthwash covers and cleans all of your teeth. After “I swish it around,” I “gargle.” The verb “to  gargle (gargle) means to take water and to put it into your back of your mouth. I  will have to demonstrate this. It's easier to understand if you can hear it. [Garg ling sound] That's to gargle. That's just an extra little bonus for listening to this episode; you get to hear me gargle! Well, after I gargle, I have to get rid of or remov e the water from my mouth, and I do that by spitting. “To spit” (spit) means to take  something that's liquid, like water, and to remove it from your mouth. Usually, y ou make a certain sound like [spitting sound] - something like that. Well, now we've gargled and spit. I say these are “ Not pleasant, but necessary,” not necessarily something nice but something I have  to do. After I use the mouthwash, “Then I get out,” or take out, the floss . “Floss” (floss) is a piece of string that you put in between your teeth to clean;  we call that floss. And there's a verb, “to floss,” which means to use that little pi ece of string. “When I’m done flossing,” when I have finished flos sing, “I pull out,” or take out, “the toothbrush and the toothpaste.” The toothbrush  is what you use to clean your teeth; the toothpaste is like the soap that yo u use to clean your teeth. But, we do not call it tooth soap. We call it toothpaste . It comes in a container that we call a “tube,” and the tube (tube) is where the too thpaste is, and you usually squeeze the tube (squeeze) to get the toothpaste ou t of the tube. So, I put some toothpaste on my toothbrush and then  I brush. We use that verb, “to brush,” to mean to clean my teeth. But, we don' t say, “I'm going to clean my teeth.” Usually we say, “I'm going to brush my teet h.” That same verb, “to brush,” can also be used with your hair, when you are tryin g to put your hair in a certain place, a certain position. I don't brush my hair, of course, because I don't have any hair, but I used to, when I was younger, brush my hair. I finished brushing my teeth, so now I'm going to t ake a shower. There's a difference between taking a shower, where the water  comes from the top of the wall and goes over you, and a bath, which means to fill your bathtub with water

and get in. Most American homes have the tub and the shower in one place. Some homes have a separate shower and a separate tu b. In the story, I say that “I pull the shower curtain  aside.” The “curtain” (curtain) is what you use to keep the water in the shower from g oing onto the floor. It prevents the water from leaving the shower area. We  use that word, “curtain,” also for the things that you can put over your wind ow in your house or apartment, so nobody can see inside; that's also called a curt ain. Well, “I pull the shower curtain aside,” meaning I put it to one side, the left side or the right side. I “step into the tub, and I pull the curtain back,” I put it back in its original position. “I turn on both the hot and the cold water.” “To turn on” means that I turn the faucet on so that the water comes o ut. Remember, the faucet is where water comes out for a sink; it's also where the water comes out for a tub or a shower. Actually, for the shower, the top of the shower, we don't normally call that a faucet; we call that a showerhead (head). So , the showerhead is where the water comes out when you're taking a shower. And, i f you are drawing a bath, meaning if you are putting water into your tub to t ake a bath—to draw a bath— then you use the faucet. The water comes out of the  faucet spout (spout). That's the part of the faucet where the water actually com es out of. I step into the shower, I turn on “the hot and cold  water, looking for the perfect temperature,” not too hot, not too cold. “I lather up with soap.” “To lather” (lather) or to “lather up” means to take soap and put it on your skin and then put water on it, and you rub the soap and the water together unt il you make little bubbles,  until the soap and water covers your skin. That is to lat her or to lather up. Well, “I lather up with” some “soap,” and then I “p ut some shampoo in my hair.” “Shampoo” (shampoo) is the soap for your head, for your hair, if you have hair. So, you take this special soap, usually it is a liq uid soap, and you put it on your hair and that is called shampoo. You can also lathe r up your shampoo. You take your hands and you move them back and forth quickly , and that would lather up your shampoo. Well, after you do that, then you have to get rid of the soap and the shampoo, and you do that by rinsing. “To rinse” (rinse) mean s to take water and get rid of the soap and the shampoo that are on your body. Aft er you do that, then you have to dry your body off. “To dry off” means the s ame as to dry, but we use that expression, “to dry off,” to mean to dry, in this c ase, your body with a towel. Now, it is time for me to shave. “To shave” (shave)  means to remove hair, usually from your face. If you are a man and you don't shav e, you will grow a beard and

a mustache; you will have hair on your face. Well, I don't like beards and mustaches, so I shave - I use something to get rid of the hair. The thing I use to get rid of the hair is the “razo r” (razor). A razor is like a knife. It has a blade (blade) and the blade is the thing that  actually cuts the hair, that removes the hair. So, you have a razor that you use  to shave the whiskers from your face. A “whisker” (whisker) is the name we giv e the hair on your face, at least for a man, we call those whiskers. So, you ca n have an electric razor, like I used to have, or you can have a hand razor. A hand razor is one that is not electric that you just take and you shave by moving  the razor back and forth on your face. Before I shave, I have to “lather up with shaving c ream.” We already know that word “lather up” – it means to mix the soap with wa ter and make bubbles so that it spreads across your skin. “Shaving cream” (cream ) is the special kind of soap or special kind of liquid material that you put on your face to make it easier for you to shave, so you don't cut yourself or hurt you rself when you are shaving. “I rinse the razor” after I am done shaving, and I “throw the disposable blades in the trash.” The blades are the things that go on to p of the razor that cut the whiskers, or remove the whiskers. “Disposable” (dis posable) comes from the verb “to dispose” (dispose), which means to throw a way, to put in the trash, to put in the garbage. That is disposable. If somethin g is disposable, you use it once or twice and then you throw it away. Well, the se are disposable blades. Now it's seven o'clock when I finish showering and shaving, and I am “on to breakfast,” meaning now I am going to have my break fast. Let's listen to the story again, this time at a nat ive rate of speech. [Start of story] I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a.m. My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The toi let is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup,  swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit. Not pleasant, but necess ary. Then I get out the floss. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush a nd the toothpaste. I brush and then it’s off to the shower. I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub,  and pull the curtain back. I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the  perfect temperature. I lather up

with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off. Now it’s shaving time. I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn’t shave close enough. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up wit h shaving cream, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the disposable b lades in the trash. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to breakfast. [End of story] Her scripts are always pleasant. I speak, of course , of our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy!

# Eating Breakfast

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 4: Eating Breakfast

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number four. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, the third of our 10-part special s eries on daily English, I’ll talk about eating breakfast in the morning.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

I walk into my kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker.   I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it’s ready to go.  Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored.  I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffle s, but the truth is that I just don’t have the time to cook.

So, I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in a gla ss of skim milk, making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray.  I go outs ide and pick up my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table.  I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stori es.  When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of t oast with jam.  I rinse off my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the di shwasher.  By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work.

[End of story]

In this episode, we are eating our breakfast.  I be gin by walking into my kitchen and turning on the coffeemaker.  Notice these verbs , “to walk into” or “to walk in,” “to turn on.”  Those two-word verbs are very common  in English.  So, I don't just walk to my kitchen, “I walk into my kitchen and I t urn on the coffeemaker.”

The “coffeemaker,” (coffeemaker) – all one word – is the machine that, you can guess, makes the coffee; that's the coffeemaker.  U sually, a coffeemaker has water on the top—place where you put the water—and then, it has a place for the actual coffee.  Now, you take the coffee and you pu t it into a piece of paper or a

piece of plastic called a filter.  The “filter” (fi lter) is something that allows the water to go through it, but doesn't allow the coffe e to go through it.

So, you put the coffee into the filter and the hot water goes through the coffee, it goes out of the filter and goes into the “coffee po t” (pot) the coffee pot is on the bottom.  So, you have the coffee, the coffee filter , and the coffee pot.  After the water goes through the coffee, what you have to thr ow out—what you have to remove when you are done—are called the “coffee gro unds” (grounds)

Well, “I put in the coffee, the filter, and the wat er the night before,” meaning, in this case, last night, “so that it is ready to go,”  meaning when I walk into the kitchen, it is already ready, I just have to turn it on.  Some coffeemakers have clocks that will automatically turn your coffeemake r on in the morning.

“Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the ce real is stored.”  The “cupboard” – cupboard – which looks like the word “ cup” and the word “board” put together, but is pronounced cupboard — a cupboa rd is like a cabinet.  It's a place where you store things — a place where you ke ep things.  “To store” (store) – as a verb, means to keep something in a p lace — to keep something in a cupboard, or cabinet, or a box.  Well, the cupboa rd is what we call the cabinets that are in the kitchen.  They're the like wooden b oxes that have doors on them that you can put things in.  Usually, if it's a big  cupboard, you have different “shelves” (shelves) the singular is “shelf” (shelf) .

Well, I go into the cupboard and I get the cereal o ut.  The “cereal” (cereal) is a very popular breakfast in the United States.  It's usually dry and you put milk in a bowl, with the cereal, and eat the cereal and the m ilk together.  I love cereal in the morning.  I really do; I have cereal every morn ing.  Since I was, I think, five years old, I've been eating cereal.

I take the cereal out — where it is stored in the c upboard — and I prepare my breakfast.  I say in the story that “I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning.”  “Ham” is a type of meat that comes from a pig; it usually has a lot of salt in it.  Another kind of m eat that's popular in the morning for breakfast is “bacon” (bacon) which is also meat  that comes from a pig.  It is long and thin usually; it's cut to be long and thin .  Eggs are the things that come from chickens — or does the chicken come from the e gg?  I'm not sure.

Anyway, we have ham and eggs, which is a very popul ar American breakfast. Many people in the United States eat what we would call a very heavy breakfast, meaning there's lots of fat and there's lots of foo d.  In some countries, this is not

done, but in the United States it's very common for  people to have eggs and ham for breakfast.  My father used to have eggs every m orning for breakfast before he went to work.

Well, I say, “I would love to have ham and eggs for  breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles.”  A “waffle” (waffle) is something that is made from batter.  “Batter” (batter) when we talk about cooki ng is a liquid, made usually with eggs, and flower, and perhaps milk, and you combine  these things together and you get a thick liquid, which we call batter, and y ou take the batter and you put it into a special cooking machine, which we call a “wa ffle iron” (iron)  And, a waffle iron has a certain shape, usually it's square, and when you put the batter in, you close the top of it and you cook it from both sides .  And, when you take it out, it has little squares in it, and this is called a waff le.  It's a kind of almost like a bread.  And, after you make the waffle, you usually  put some special type of liquid sugar, which we call “syrup” (syrup).  Often , this comes from trees; the best syrup comes from maple leaf trees.  It's called map le syrup; it's very good.  And, you put that thick sugar liquid on top of the waffl e.  You can also put some sort of fruit on top of the waffle also; I just like the su gar, myself.

Something similar to a waffle is a “pancake” (panca ke) – all one word – and a pancake is also made from this batter — this liquid  — thick liquid — except it goes into a flat pan on your stove and you flip it over.  So, it's completely flat, there are no squares in it, usually it's round, and  that's called a pancake.

Both waffles and pancakes can be in stacks.  A “sta ck” (stack) is when you have one long, thin thing on top of another.  So, you ca n have a stack of paper, pieces of paper one on top of the other.  The same is true  with a waffle or with pancakes.  You can have a stack of waffles, one waf fle on top of another, or a stack of pancakes.  Usually, we talk about a stack of pancakes.  If you go to a restaurant and you order breakfast and you want pan cakes, sometimes they will ask you if want a “short stack,” meaning just one o r two, or you might have a regular stack, which could be four or five.  Rememb er, Americans eat a big breakfast, that's why there's so many big Americans .

Getting back to our story, I am not having ham, egg s or waffles; I'm having a bowl of cereal.  And, to prepare my cereal, I put it into a bowl and I pour skim milk on top.  “Skim (skim) milk” is milk with no or  very little fat in it.  Milk comes in four different types: you have whole milk, which ha s the most fat; you have two percent milk, which has somewhat less fat; you can have one percent, which is even less fat; or you can have fat free, or skim, m ilk, which has little or no fat at all.  Well, because I don't want to be a big Americ an, I have skim milk.

 In order to eat my cereal, I have to take a spoon o ut of the silverware tray.  The “silverware” (silverware) – all one word – is the n ame we give the knife, the fork, and the spoon together.  Sometimes those are called  silverware even though they are not made of silver.  Other people in a res taurant may call them utensils. “Utensils” (utensils).  If you go to a restaurant a nd you sit down and you don't have a spoon or a fork or a knife, you would ask the waiter or waitress for some utensils, or you could just say, “I need some silve rware.”

A “silverware tray” (tray) is a place where you put  the silverware — you put the utensils, the forks, the spoons, the knives — in a drawer.  And, usually a tray is like a little box that has holes in it for specific  things.  That word, tray, can also be used to describe a small, flat piece of plastic or wood that you use to carry things on, like your dishes.

Well, I get my spoon, and I go out and I get my new spaper, which, of course, is what has the news, the sports, and the internationa l and national news.  Many Americans like to read a newspaper in the morning, just like people all over the world do.  “I “sit down at the kitchen table and I read the paper.”  Sometimes we call a newspaper just the paper.  Someone says, “I read it in the paper this morning,” they mean the newspaper.

Usually I just have time to read a couple of storie s, a few of the stories.  When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam.”  “To grab” (grab) means to take something, us ually with your hand.  “To grab something with your hand” means to pick it up — to take it with your hand. “I grab a banana,” which I like to eat, and “a slic e of toast with jam.”

“Toast” (toast) is bread that you put in something called a “toaster” (toaster) and the toaster heats up the bread until the bread is b rown on the outside.  “A slice of toast” (slice) is a piece of toast.  We use the wor ds slice when we are talking about one piece of bread, or one piece of cake.  Yo u can have a slice of cake; you can also have a slice of pie.

This is a slice of toast, which is bread that we pu t in a toaster, and we toast the bread.  We can use toast as a verb as well.  And, a fter I toast the bread, I can put butter on it or I can put “jam” (jam). And, jam is made from fruit — such as strawberries — and sugar, and they put them togethe r and it makes a thick liquid that you can put on a piece of toast.  We would say  we spread the jam on the toast.  We use that verb “spread” (spread) to talk about putting butter or putting jam on a piece of toast, usually with a knife.

 When I am done with my breakfast, “I rinse off my b reakfast dishes.”  “To rinse” means to clean something with water.  To rinse off is the verb.  You could just say, “I rinse my breakfast dishes,” but we like tho se two-word verbs in English and so we would probably say, “rinse off my breakfa st dishes.”

I rinse them off in the sink, and I put them in the  dishwasher.  The “dishwasher” (dishwasher) is a machine that cleans the dishes.  Some families have dishwashers.  The joke that we make sometimes in En glish is that someone — when someone says, “Oh, do you have a dishwasher?” and you say, “Yes, I am the dishwasher,” which means you don't have a machi ne that washes your dishes; you wash your dishes by yourself.  We would  say you wash them by hand.

But the time I'm finished rinsing off my breakfast dishes, my coffee is ready and so, I pour myself a cup.  Notice the use of that ve rb, “pour.”  We use that verb when we are removing liquid from a bottle and putti ng it into a cup or a glass. We also used that verb, “pour,” when I said, “I pou r myself a bowl of cereal.” Now, cereal isn't liquid, but it is something that you can put into another container, in this case, into a bowl, and it comes out of the bigger container and into the smaller container.  So, it comes out of the cereal box and goes into the bowl.  So, we use that verb usually when we talk ab out liquid things like water or milk, but you can also use it when we talk about ce real.

Well, “I pour myself a cup” of coffee and I “put the rest in a Thermos for work.”  A Thermos, which is “Thermos,” is a bottle that keeps  hot liquid hot and cold liquid cold.  So, if you have hot coffee and you put it in to a Thermos, the Thermos—this bottle—will keep it hot for a long time.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regul ar speed.

[Start of story]

I walk into my kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker.   I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it’s ready to go.  Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored.  I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffle s, but the truth is that I just don’t have the time to cook.

So, I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in a gla ss of skim milk, making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray.  I go outs ide and pick up my newspaper,

and sit down at the kitchen table.  I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stori es.  When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of t oast with jam.  I rinse off my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the di shwasher.  By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work.

# Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 5: Getting Dress and Ready for Work

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number five. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, I’ll talk about getting dressed an d ready for work.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

I go back into my bedroom and open up closet door.  I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and s ome sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts.  I pull out a clean pair of socks and und erwear, and then decide which shirt I’m going to wear today.  I’m terrible at col or coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and  pants.  I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes.  I put my cell p hone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one.

I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag.  I used  to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers. Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos o n the way out the door.  I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garag e.  I’m usually running late and today is no exception!

[End of story]

Part four is called “Getting Dressed and Ready for Work.”  We began by me going into the bedroom and opening up my closet doo r.  “To open up” means here to open the door.  A “closet” (closet) is a pl ace, usually in your bedroom, where you put clothes—you store your clothing.  You  can also have a closet in other parts of your house, and it's usually a place  where you keep things—you store things.

Well, I “open up my closet door” and I look at my d ress shirts.  My “dress (dress) shirts” – two words. are the nice shirts, the shirt s that I can wear to work.  The

ESL Podcast 5 - Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

opposite of a dress shirt would be a “casual shirt”  (casual).  A dress shirt is a nice shirt; something that usually has a collar on it.  A “collar” (collar) is the top of the shirt, what goes around the neck.

Well, I look at my dress shirts and I look, also, a t my “pants” (pants). Pants are what you put on your legs.  You can have different kinds of pants.  Jeans is a type of pants.  We might say dress pants for nice p ants that you would wear to work.  I also have “ties”.  A “tie” (tie) is a long , thin thing that goes around your neck that men usually wear—often wear to work, and it comes in different colors, and that's your tie.

A “sweater” (sweater) is something that keeps you w arm.  It's like a shirt that's very thick.  You usually put a sweater over your shirt so that you can be warm. “Suit jackets” (suit jackets) – two words – are jac kets that you wear that are for a formal occasion.  So, if you are going to work, esp ecially if you were going to an interview, you would wear a suit jacket.  The word “suit” (suit) refers to a formal set of clothing for, in this case, a man.  For a ma n it would be pants and a, probably, white shirt and a suit jacket that goes o ver your shirt.  Usually, you would also have a tie that you wear.  That's a suit .  Well, a suit jacket is part of a suit.

A “t-shirt,” spelled (t-shirt)is a plain shirt that  you usually wear underneath a dress shirt.  So first, you put on a t-shirt—a white t-sh irt—then you would put on your shirt, and then you would put on you jacket.  T-shi rts can also be used by themselves as your main shirt.  It is usually an in formal occasion that you would just wear a t-shirt.  You probably wouldn't wear a t-shirt to your office, for example, though some people do.  And, many people h ave t-shirts that have things on them—that say things on them.  T-shirts u sually do not have a collar like a dress shirt does.

“I pull out a pair of socks and underwear.”  “Socks ” (socks) are the things you put on your feet before you put your shoe on.  Socks ca n be dark, or they can be light or white socks.  Normally you don't wear whit e socks with a formal suit; you would wear black or dark blue socks.

“Underwear” is the piece of clothing that you put o n and it covers up all of the— how should we say—things that you want to cover so that you can keep your pants and shirt clean.  Underwear is something that  goes over your back of your body, your butt or your rear, as well as the front of the body, whatever you have there.  Underwear can come for men in two basics st yles usually.  There can be boxer underwear, or “boxer” shorts (boxer) and that 's a kind of short—or rather, a

ESL Podcast 5 - Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

kind of underwear that it is loose on the bottom.  So, it's almost like a pair of shorts.  The opposite of that would be “briefs” (br iefs).  Briefs would be underwear that is not loose at the bottom; it's tig ht at the bottom of the underwear.  Usually it's a little smaller as well.

I “then decide which shirt I'm going to wear today.   “I'm terrible,” I say, “at color coordinating.”  “Color coordinating” means you wear  things that have similar or matching colors.  So, if you wore a pink shirt you would probably not wear green pants because they don't do together, we would say;  they don't look very good with each other.  Color coordinating is finding the  right colors that you wear on your—with your shirt, and your pants, and your tie,  and your jacket, and your socks, and your shoes.  All of those have to be col or coordinated.  The verb “to coordinate,” (coordinate) means to put two things t ogether so that they work well together, in this case.

Well, since I'm so terrible—I'm so bad—at color coo rdinating I usually bring in my wife, that is I go and ask my wife to come into the  room.  So, I “bring my wife in”—to the room— “at this point to help me,” meanin g at this time, when I've already picked out some things, then I bring my wif e to help me “match my shirt and pants.”  I want them color coordinate.

“I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish  my shoes.”  A “belt” (belt) is what you use to keep your pants from falling down.  A buckle is the piece of, usually, metal in the front that connects the belt so it forms a circle around your body.  I have a silver buckle that I put on with my  belt.

I also “polish my shoes.”  “To polish” (polish) mea ns to clean and to make “shiny” (shiny).  When we say something is shiny, we mean t hat it's bright—it reflects light.  So, when you polish your shoes, you want th em to be clean but you also want them to look like they are bright—they are ref lecting light.  I polish my shoes and my head, so it's very shiny!

“I put my cell phone,” my cellular or mobile phone,  “and car keys in my front pocket.”  You have front pockets and you have back pockets in a pair of pants. So, I put my keys and cell phone in the front pocke t “and my wallet in the back” pocket.  My “wallet” (wallet) is where I put my money and my credit cards and my driver's license; all of those things go in my wall et.

“I put on my glasses,” because I cannot see without  my glasses very well, and I “check myself in the mirror.”  “To check yourself” means to look at yourself, usually in a mirror, and you can see how you look.  I usually look pretty ugly.  I

ESL Podcast 5 - Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

check myself in the mirror, and then I go into my “ home office,” or my office in my house and get my bag.  I used to carry a more tradi tional briefcase.”  A “briefcase” (briefcase) – all one word – is not som ething that you put your underwear in—your briefs.  A briefcase means the th ing that you carry papers in when you are going from your home to your office.  Usually a briefcase is square and it usually has hard sides on it, many times it has a lock on the top; that's a briefcase.  A lot of people nowadays do not use a b riefcase; they use a computer bag—a bag that they can put their computer and othe r information in, including their papers.

Well, I put my things into my computer bag, then I go “back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos,” to get or take my Thermos with my  coffee in it “on the way out the door.”  The expression, “on the way out,” m eans that you are about to leave or you are leaving your house, in this case.  Somebody may call you on the phone and you are getting ready to go to dinner, yo u could say, “I can't talk right now, I'm on my way out the door,” means I'm just ge tting ready to leave.

Well, before I leave—before I'm going out the door— I “grab my Thermos.  I lock the door,” to my house, “and then I hurry to my car  in the garage.”  The “garage” (garage) is the place where you keep your car.

“I'm usually running late and today is no exception !”  When you are running late, you are behind your schedule; you're behind time th at you want to be somewhere.  “To run late” means the same as to be l ate or to be tardy (tardy). Usually that word, “tardy,” is only used in school.   We say a student is tardy, we mean that they are late for school or late for clas s.  To be running late means that you are not on the schedule that you want to b e on—that you did not leave at the time you wanted to leave.

I say “I'm running late and today is no exception!”   That expression, “is no exception” (exception) means that today is the same  as every other day—it is not different.  An exception is when something is diffe rent.  Well, today is no different, that means today is no exception—it is n ot different.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[Start of story]

I go back into my bedroom and open up my closet doo r.  I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and s ome sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts.  I pull out a clean pair of socks and und erwear, then decide which shirt

ESL Podcast 5 - Getting Dressed & Ready for Work

I’m going to wear today.  I’m terrible at color coo rdinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pa nts.  I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes.  I put my cell p hone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one. I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag.  I used  to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers. Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos o n the way out the door.  I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garag e.  I’m usually running late and today is no exception!

# The Commute to Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 6: The Commute to Work

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number six. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, the fifth of our 10-part special s eries on daily English, I’ll talk about commuting or traveling to work.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the ba ck seat, and get comfortable for my drive.  I put my coffee mug into the cup hol der, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car.  My wife dro ve the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirr ors.  I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report.  I take the trans mission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street , close the garage door, and put the car into drive.  I used to drive a stick shift,  but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.

I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off.  My office is  only a few miles from the exit.  I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in.  I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator.   And that only took 40 minutes!

[End of story]

Part five is called “The Commute to Work.”  “Commut e” (commute) can be both a noun and a verb.  It means to go from your house to  your work.  Usually, if you live a long distance from your work, you would say,  “I have a long commute.”  Or, if you live close to work, you would have a short c ommute.  If it's a very long commute with lots of traffic, you might say, “I hav e a terrible commute” - a very bad commute.

ESL Podcast 6 - The Commute to Work

The story begins by me saying that “I open my car d oor and throw my briefcase in the back seat.”  So, I open my “front door” - the door that we would call the driver's side, where the driver gets in, and in an American car, that is on the left side.  Cars in Britain are on the right side, is the driver's side.  So, I get into the left side in the front door.  If you have a car tha t has a back seat, you could have a two-door car or a four-door car.  “Four doors” me ans that you have separate doors for the back seat.

The “seat” (seat) is what you sit in.  So, the back  seat is where people can sit behind you - behind the driver and behind the perso n next to the driver.  We call the seats the passenger seats and the driver's seat .  The right side of the car is usually called the passenger side of the car.

I “get comfortable for my drive” - for my commute -  notice we use drive there as a noun; it can be a verb and a noun.  “I put my coffe e mug into the cup holder.”  A “mug” (mug) is just a big cup.  We talk about coffe e mugs, they're big cups that you put your coffee into.  In many cars, there is a  special place for a cup or a bottle, and that's called a “cup holder” (holder).  It holds the cup so you can have your coffee in your car.

I “put the keys in the ignition.”  The “keys” are, of course, what starts your car. It's the piece of metal that you open your car door  with - you unlock it.  Well, you also start the car with your keys, and you put them  into something called the “ignition.”  And, the “ignition” (ignition) is the part of the car that starts the engine. Usually it makes a certain sound - a certain noise,  and once the engine starts, then you don't have to put the key forward, you jus t leave the key there, you take your hand off of it.  The word ignition comes from the verb “to ignite” (ignite) which means to start a fire - to start something bu rning, and of course, a car burns gasoline, that's what the engine does in orde r to make the car move.

After I put the keys into the ignition, I “find the  gas pedal.”  A “pedal” (pedal) is something you use to control with your feet usually  the speed of something.  So the gas pedal is the pedal that you press down to g o faster, it gives the engine more gas.  That word, pedal, can also be used as a verb.  If you are on a bicycle, in order to make the bicycle move, you have to peda l because the things that your feet are on, on a bike, or a bicycle, are call ed pedals.  Well, you don't pedal your car, but you do have a gas pedal.

I “start the car,” and because “My wife drove the c ar last night, I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror.”  “To re-adjust” means to adj ust again.  That prefix (re) means again in English, usually.  “To adjust means”  to-to move them so that I

ESL Podcast 6 - The Commute to Work

can see properly - I can see into the mirror.  Ther e are two types of mirrors on your car: there's the “rear (rear) view (view) mirr or” and that is in the front of the car, on the front window of the car.  The front win dow of your car is called your “windshield” (windshield) – the windshield.  So, on  your windshield, on the top in the middle, is your rear view mirror, and that allo ws you to see cars behind you. There are also mirrors on the side of the car, usua lly on both sides, and those are called the side mirrors.

“I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time tr affic report.”  “Drive time” is the time of day when most people are either going to wo rk or coming back from work.  So, in the morning the drive time in Los Ang eles, for example, is 7:30 to 9:30.  Most people are going to work during those h ours.  In other cities it could be different; in some cities, it's earlier than tha t.  There's also a drive time at the end of the day, between 5:00 and 7:00 here in Los A ngeles, that's when people are coming home from work.

So, the drive time traffic report is an announcemen t on the radio telling you if there are any accidents on the roads, if there is a ny “construction” - that is the government is fixing the road and it may be closed.   And, it tells you if you are going to take a long time or not a long time.  So, traffic reports tell you how fast the cars are moving on different, usually, freeways  in American cities.

“I take the transmission out of park and into rever se.”  The “transmission” (transmission) is the part of the car that determin es how fast you go.  It also determines if you go forward or backwards - if you' re going straight ahead or behind; that's the transmission.  Sometimes it's ca lled a “transmission box” (box) and inside of that box there are little wheels call ed “gears” (gears) and depending on the gear you are in, we would say, depending on the gear you are using, you will either go very fast or not very fast, or you w ill go in “reverse” (reverse).  To go into reverse means to go backwards - the car moves backwards.

Well, before I go anywhere, I have to “take the tra nsmission out of park,” (park). “Park” is when the car is not going forward or goin g backwards.  We say you put the transmission into park, and you take it out of park.  And when you take it out of park, you either go forward or backwards.  Well,  here I'm going in reverse, and I “back out into the driveway.”  “To back out” mean s to go backwards.  Usually that verb, to back out, is used when you are talkin g about a car or a truck that is leaving a garage, and it's going in reverse - you b ack out of the garage.  “I back out into the driveway” onto the street, or “into the street.”  The “driveway” (driveway) is what connects the garage to the stree t.  It's the space that is in between your street and where your car is parked, y our garage.

ESL Podcast 6 - The Commute to Work

 Some people actually don't have a garage, and so th ey park in their driveway. They drive off the street and they park their car i n the driveway, that piece of land where you can put your car.  I like to park my car on my neighbor's driveway so I have more room on my driveway.  He doesn't like it though.  So, I back out of the garage, and then I “close the garage door, and put the car into drive.”  Here's another use of that word, drive.  In this case, it means I'm putting it in a gear that will take me forward.  So, to put a car into drive means that you change the position of the transmission so that your car will go forward and not backwards.

“I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older,  I like my automatic transmission more and more.”  There are two kinds of transmissio ns - two kinds of cars.  One is what we call an automatic transmission, where yo u put your car either into reverse or into drive, and that's it.  You don't ha ve to change anything.

Another kind of car is called a stick shift, or a m anual transmission.  “Manual” (manual) is the opposite of automatic; it means by hand.  So, if you have a manual transmission, or a stick shift, you have to move the transmission each time you want to go faster or slower.  The word “st ick (stick) shift (shift)” (two words) is the same as a manual transmission.  Some people say, “I drive a stick,” they mean, “I drive a stick shift.”

The word “shift” is also a verb, “to shift,” and th at means to change.  So, if you have a manual transmission - a stick shift - you sh ift from one gear to another.  If you want to go faster, you have to shift into a hig her gear.  Well, if you don't have a manual transmission, you don't have to worry abou t it.

If you have a stick shift, you have an extra pedal in the car.  Remember, we said that a pedal can be a gas pedal - something that ma kes you go faster.  You also have a brake pedal that will slow or stop your car.   And, if you have a stick shift, you have a third pedal, which we call the “clutch” (clutch). And in order to change from one gear to another, to go faster or slower or  to go into reverse, if you have a stick shift, you have to press on or put your foo t on the clutch so that you can change, or shift, gears.

“I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get  on the onramp for the freeway.” The “onramp” (onramp) is what connects the street to the freeway.  So, just like a driveway connects the street to your garage, an onr amp connects the street to the freeway.  The opposite of an onramp would be, of course, an off ramp, and that's where you go off of the freeway and back to the street.

ESL Podcast 6 - The Commute to Work

Well, I get onto the onramp, or “I get on the onram p and I drive to where I have to get off.  My office is only a few miles from the ex it.”  The “exit” (exit) is where you leave the freeway.  It can be a noun or it can be a  verb.  “To exit” means to leave, and normally, in a public building, a hotel or othe r areas, they have a sign that says, “exit,” so you know in case there is an emerg ency how to leave the room or leave the building.  On an airplane, we have someth ing called the emergency exits, and those are doors that you use if the plan e is having problems.  I hope you never have to use the emergency exits.

Well, this is an exit from the freeway, and “my off ice is only a few miles” after I get off of the freeway.  “I pull into the parking g arage,” the place at my work where you park or keep your car, and I swipe my key  card to get in.  A “key card” (key card) – two words – is like a credit card.  It 's an electronic card that the company gives you that allows you to get in and out  of a garage, in and out of the building, maybe even in and out of your office, and  it's an electronic card, like a credit card.  To swipe is the verb we use when we t alk about credit cards or key cards.  “To swipe,” (swipe) means to take the card and put it into what we would call a reader very quickly.  So, for a credit card,  the clerk will swipe the card - will put it through the machine very quickly.  For a key  card, you put it through the machine so you can get into somewhere.  It's a key - an electronic key.

I “park my car,” I “grab my briefcase and my coffee ” - very important, my coffee - and I “head toward the elevator.”  “To head toward something” means to walk in that direction or move in that direction.  So, I wa lk toward the elevator, and my whole trip “only took 40 minutes.”

Americans love to complain about how terrible their  commutes are.  In some cities, 30 or 40 minutes is considered a long commu te, and in some cities, like Los Angeles, it's considered an average commute.  I n other countries, some people commute an hour or an hour and a half in ord er to get to their work.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regul ar speed.

[Start of story]

I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the ba ck seat, and get comfortable for my drive.  I put my coffee mug into the cup hol der, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car.  My wife dro ve the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirr ors.  I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report.  I take the trans mission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street , close the garage door, and put

the car into drive.  I used to drive a stick shift,  but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.

I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off.  My office is  only a few miles from the exit.  I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in.  I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator.   And that only took 40 minutes!

[End of story]

That concludes part five of “A Day in the Life of J eff: The Commute to Work.”  In part six, we actually get to work and go to lunch.

# At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 7: At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number seven. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, I’ll talk about working at my desk , going on a short break, and going to lunch.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

On the way to the office, I was thinking about what  I have on my agenda today. When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memo s and papers in my inbox. When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-doze n emails I need to go through.  Just as I start in on the email, my phone  rings.  It’s my project manager, Julie, asking me to come in for a conference call w ith our head office.  I don’t get back to my desk for nearly two hours.  By that time , I was ready for a break.

At 10:30, I head down to the break room and get som e hot water at the water cooler to make some tea.  There were a couple of ot her people on break, having snacks out of the vending machine and reading the n ew notices on the bulletin board.  I run into Sam, one of my friends at work, and we chat a little before going back to work.

Before long, it’s time for lunch.  I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk.  If I don’t have time to pack a lunc h, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out.  The only trouble is, it’ s always so busy during the lunch hour and I always have to stand in line.  That’s us ually a pain.  On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from wor k.  On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.

[End of Story]

Part six is called “At my Desk, on Break, and at Lu nch.”  Notice the use of those prepositions.  Prepositions are very difficult to t ranslate and many people get confused when you start learning another language t rying to figure out those little

ESL Podcast 7 - At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

words - which word should you use.  There's a diffe rence between “at my desk” and “on my desk” and “in my desk.”  Those all mean different things.

“On your desk” means something is on top of your de sk, like your computer.  “In your desk” means something is inside one of the dra wers of your desks.  “At your desk” means that you are sitting next to your desk - you are, we hope, working, like you're supposed to be working right now, inste ad of listening to this episode.

“On break” is the expression we use when you are st opping work for a short time, usually ten, 15, maybe 20 minutes.  “At lunch” mean s you are going to lunch - you are eating.  We don't say, “in lunch” or “on lu nch,” we say, “at lunch.”  The best way to learn those little prepositions is just  to read and to listen more and more, and eventually, you will know them without ev en having to study them.

Our story begins by me saying that, “On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today.”  Your agenda , “agenda,” means your plan for today - what are the things that you have to do today.  This could include meetings; it could include phone calls; you could h ave many different things on your agenda.

There's another expression, “to have an agenda.”  T o have an agenda means that you have a plan, sometimes a secret plan that you don't tell anyone about that makes you want to do a certain thing.  It's li ke having an opinion and trying to get other people to do what you want them to do; th at's to have an agenda.  But here, agenda just means a list of things that you'r e going to do.

“When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new mem os and papers in my inbox.” Stack, you'll remember, is when you have thin thing s on top of each other.  You can have a stack of pancakes; here we have a stack of papers and memos.  A “memo” (memo) is short for memorandum, and it is us ually like a letter that you send to someone in your company - in your office.  Your “inbox” (inbox) can be a little box on your desk where people put things for  you to do, your boss, for example.  And, when you are done with them, you can  put them in your out box. Those terms, inbox and out box, are also used for e mail programs now.

When I turn on my computer, I have at least two-doz en emails I need to go through.  The expression, “to go through,” here mea ns I have to read them and maybe respond to them.  Someone may say, “I have to  go through my email,” they mean I have to read my email, and I have to re spond, sometimes, to my email.  I have to do that everyday, just like you d o, but most of my emails come from you.

ESL Podcast 7 - At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

 “Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings.”  The expression “to start in on something” means to begin to do something.  So, is tart in on my phone calls, that means that I have many phone calls and I start  making them - I begin making them.

There's a different expression, to start in on some one - on a person, and if you start in on a person - on your brother, on your wif e - that means that you are criticizing them - you're saying something bad - so mething negative about them. When I was younger, if I didn't do my homework, whi ch was often, my mother would start in on me, meaning she would criticize m e.  “Jeffrey, do your homework!”  The only person who calls me “Jeffrey” is my mother.

Back to our story, I said that my phone rang and it  was my project manager, Julie.  The manager is the person that is in charge  of a certain group of people - someone who is the boss - and a project is just a s et of things for you to do, usually related to each other.  Well, my project ma nager, who's like my boss, asked me to come in for a conference call with our head office.  A “conference, (conference) call” is a telephone call with three o r more people.  And, that's very common in American business and in international bu siness to have a conference call so more than one person can talk on  the telephone.  The head office (head) is the same as the main office, and t his is where the company has most of its important people who are working, it's sometimes called its headquarters.  The head office is the main office.  The opposite of head office would be a branch office (branch).  A branch office  is a smaller office.

We were having a conference call with someone in ou r head office, and I didn't get back to my desk - I didn't return to my desk - for almost, or nearly two hours. By that time, I was ready for a break.  At 10:30, I  head down to the break room. The “break room” (break room) – two words – is a pl ace in a building - in your office, where people can go and read and relax, per haps eat their lunch, or eat some food, It's a place for you to stop work and to  relax a little or to talk to other people.  I use the verb “to head down,” that simply  means to go to somewhere. We sometimes use that expression when we are talkin g about going to a different place.  “I'm going to head down to the bo ss's office” - I'm going to go over to the boss' office.

Well, “I head down to the break room” - I go to the  break room - “and get some hot water from the water cooler.”  The “water coole r” (cooler) is a little machine that has water and you can get hot water or you can  get cold water.  That expression, the water cooler, is very common.  When  people say, “I heard it at

ESL Podcast 7 - At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

the water cooler,” or “around the water cooler,” th at usually refers to people who are gossiping - who are talking about things they p robably shouldn't.

Well, I went to the water cooler and I made myself some tea, because I love drinking tea.  There are “a couple of other people on break,” notice that we use that expression “on break” - people who have stoppe d working - “having snacks out of the vending machine.”  A “snack” (snack) is a piece of food that you eat between breakfast and lunch, or between lunch and d inner, or between dinner and going to bed.  A “vending machine” (vending) is  a big machine where you can buy, usually, food.  The verb “to vend” (vend) means to sell.  So, it's a place where you can sell food and you put your money in a nd you can press a button and you get things like cookies and potato chips, a ll the things that are not good for you in the vending machine.

Some people are also reading the new notices on the  bulletin board.  The “bulletin board” (bulletin board) – two words – is a big piece of usually wood or plastic where people put important messages for oth er people to read.  You can have a bulletin board at your work; you can have a bulletin board in a school, and usually, it's a place where different people can co me and read the news or new things or new announcements.

“I run into Sam, one of my friends at work.”  The v erb “to run into” means I meet him although I was not expecting to meet him.  So, “I run into Sam, and we chat a little before going back to work.”  “To chat” (ch at) means to talk, usually about something not very important.

“Before long, it’s time for lunch,” meaning after a  short time, it's time for lunch. Before long, means a short time or after a short ti me.  “I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk.”  Notice tha t use of “at my desk,” means I'm sitting by my desk and I'm eating my lunch – so unds kind of lonely.

“If I don’t have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out.”  “To pack” (pack) a lunch means to make your lunch at home - a sandwich, for example - and put that into a bag or a box that you take with you to work; that is to pack a lunch.  If I don't pack a l unch, I usually eat “take-out” (take- out.”)  Take-out is when you go to a restaurant but  you don't eat at the restaurant - you don't “dine in,” we would say, (dine) in, you  don't dine in, you do take-out. You could also have the restaurant deliver the food  - bring the food to your house, or bring the food to your office, and we wou ld call that delivery.  So, you can dine in; you can do take-out, meaning you go to  the restaurant, or you can have delivery - someone brings the food to you.

ESL Podcast 7 - At My Desk, on Break, and at Lunch

 “The only trouble is,” I say, “it’s always so busy during the lunch hour.”  The “lunch hour,” in most American companies, is from n oon to one or 1:30, or 11:30 in the morning to maybe one o'clock in the afternoo n.  It's usually longer than an hour, though in some companies, you only get one ho ur.  Some companies, you only get 30 minutes to eat.

“I always have to stand in line” because it's so bu sy.  To stand in line means to wait behind other people.  In England, they would s ay to queue; in the US we say to stand in line.  I say, “That’s usually a pain.”  When we say something is a “pain” (pain) we mean that it's very inconvenient o r uncomfortable - something you do not like.  People will also say a pain in the neck or a pain in the “butt” (butt).  Those are the same basic meanings.  Someth ing that's a pain in the neck or a pain in the butt means it's not something that  you like, it's very inconvenient.

“On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch” - I go to e at somewhere else - “with a few friends from work.  On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.” “Casual” (casual) is the same as informal.  In many  companies in the United States, they have casual Friday, and that's a day w here you do not have to wear as nice of clothing.  Maybe you'll wear a t-shirt a nd not a suit jacket, or you don't have to wear a tie, and it's also a day where peopl e feel a little more relaxed. Usually it has to do with what you can wear to work .

Well, in the story I say that “On casual Fridays, w e can kick back a little and take it easy.”  “To kick back” (kick back) – two words –  means to relax.  It's an informal expression that means that you are relaxing, and ta ke it easy also means relax. Kick back is a little more informal; it's something  that you might do, for example, with your friends.  And, if you drink alcohol, you might have some alcohol and relax; that's to kick back.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[Start of story]

On the way to the office, I was thinking about what  I have on my agenda today. When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memo s and papers in my inbox.

# The Commute Home and Running Errands

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 8: The Commute Home and Running Errands

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number eight. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, I’ll talk about commuting home and  running some errands.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

It’s five o’clock and it’s quitting time.  I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people in my a rea.  I go to the parking garage and get into my car.  I signal my turn onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp.  I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour.  Traffic is stop-and-go a ll the way from downtown.  I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in fast lan e near La Brea, backing up traffic all the way to Hoover.  I decide to get off the fre eway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip.

I need to make a stop on the way home.  I know that  the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market.  I get there and I pi ck up some French bread, a bag of apples, a few bananas, some pasta, tomato sauce,  and a cooked chicken. Luckily, they have a lot of checkout stands open, a nd I get through the line pretty quickly.  I thank the cashier and the bagger and pu sh my cart to my car.  I open the trunk and load everything up.  Just then my wif e calls me on my cell phone. She was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner.  Tonight, I will be the cook.

This episode is called “The Commute Home and Runnin g Errands.”  “Commute,” you know, means driving back and forth from your ho use to your work.  “To run an errand” (errand) means to do something, usually something outside of your house.  For example, going to the grocery store, go ing to the drug store, stopping by the post office to mail a letter, these are thin gs that you have to do that are not

ESL Podcast 8 - The  Commute Home and Running Erran ds

part of your work but that you need to do in your d aily life.  And, we call these things errands, and the verb is to run an errand.

Our story says, “It's five o'clock and it's quittin g time.”  “Quitting time” is the time that you stop working.  “To quit” (quit) means to s top, so quitting time is the time that you stop working at the end of the day.  “I pu t a few files into my bag,” I “grab my mug,” - my coffee mug - and I “say goodnight to the rest of the people in my area.”  If you work at a big company, usually you a re divided into smaller groups that work on the same topic - the same type of work .  So, there is an accounting section and there is a sales section.  One way to d escribe those smaller groups is an area, so people in your area would be people who work next to you on the same things that you do.

“I go to the parking garage and get into my car.  I  signal my turn onto the street.” “To signal” (signal) means to indicate, and in a ca r it means to turn on what we call the “blinker” (blinker).  The blinker is what indicates whether you are going to turn left or right.  So, when you are driving your car and you want to make a turn, you have to signal, are you going left or are you g oing right.  And of course, in the back of the car, there's a little light that go es on and off, we would say it “flashes” (flashes).  “To flash” means to go on and  off quickly.

So, “I signal my turn” - left or right - “onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp.  I merge as best as I can onto the freeway. ”  “To merge” on the freeway or to merge when you are driving means that there a re two lanes - two cars next to each other - but the road is getting more narrow .  The road becomes smaller and now you only have one lane, so these two lines of cars have to go into the same lane, and we call that merging.  “To merge” (m erge) as a verb means to take two things and to put them together.  We talk about companies that merge; one company buys another company and they merge - they come together. Well, in traffic when you are driving, to merge mea ns to go from two lanes to one lane, and you have to go into and combine with anot her lane of traffic.

“I merge as best as I can, which is always a bit of  a hassle at this hour.”  A “hassle” (hassle) is the same as a problem.  So, it  “is always a bit of,” meaning a little bit - somewhat of a problem “at this hour.  Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown.”  We use that word “traffic” (traffi c) to mean the cars on the street or the cars on the freeway.  You may ask som eone, “How was traffic?” and they may say, “Oh, it was terrible.  Traffic was re ally bad on the freeway this afternoon.”  So, it refers to the number of cars an d how easy it is to move on the freeway or the street.  When we say traffic is “sto p-and-go,” we mean that cars are stopping then they go forward maybe ten feet, 2 0 feet, then they stop again.

ESL Podcast 8 - The  Commute Home and Running Erran ds

When there are too many cars on the freeway or on a  road, you cannot just drive straight through, you have to stop, wait for the ot her car and then go, so stop- and-go traffic means that the traffic is moving ver y slowly.

“I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in the fast lane near La Brea.”  I'm listening to the radio - to the drive time traffic report, and they tell me that there is a stalled car.  “To stall” (stall) means here to st op - to stop working.  It doesn't mean that the car will never run again - will never  work again.  Usually, when we use the verb stall, we mean that it is stopped for a temporary time because it has some problem.  So, a stalled car is a car that has stopped working, and if you are on the freeway and your car stalls, you will, of co urse, cause a problem for the other drivers.  Normally, you try to get your car o nto the shoulder.  The shoulder is the part of the freeway where you can stop your car and not get in the way of anyone else.  It's on the right hand side or the le ft hand side; you can have a shoulder on either side of the freeway.

The car that is stalled is in the fast lane.  The f ast lane on an American freeway or highway is the first lane on the left, what we w ould say the far left lane if there are more than three lanes or more than two lanes on  the freeway.  Here in Southern California we have freeways that have six or seven lanes, so if you want to go fast, normally you go to the lane that is in the far left - the first lane on the left; that's the fast lane.  Not everyone drive s fast in the fast lane, but it's the common understanding among drivers that if you are in the fast lane, you should go faster than the other cars.

Well, this car is “stalled in the fast lane near La  Brea.”  “La Brea” is a name of a street here in Los Angeles, and the car is “backing  up traffic all the way to Hoover.”  “Hoover” is another street here in LA.  “ To back up traffic” means that the cars are stopped behind you.  When we say there  is a backup on the freeway, we mean that the cars are moving very slow ly or they're stopped, usually because there's an accident, there's constr uction - they're fixing the freeway and they have one of the lanes closed, or, in our story, it's because a stalled car is in the fast lane.  So, the traffic is moving very slowly, it is backed up “all the way to Hoover,” meaning that beginning at Hoover Street, the cars are stopped or are going very slowly, and all the way to La Brea.

“I decide to get off the freeway and to take surfac e streets for the rest of the trip.” “Surface” (surface) means the top of something, but  when we say surface streets, we mean the roads and streets that are not  the freeway or the highway. So, the regular roads and streets we would call the  surface streets.

ESL Podcast 8 - The  Commute Home and Running Erran ds

“I need to make a stop on the way home,” I need to go somewhere before I go home.  “I know that the fridge is empty, so I decid e to stop by the market.” “Fridge” (fridge) is another way of saying refriger ator - it's a short way of saying refrigerator.  The fridge is where you put food to keep it cold.  So, my fridge is empty which means I don't have any food, so I decid e to go to the market.  The market here means the supermarket, a place where yo u can buy food, or it could be a smaller market, what we might call a corner ma rket; that would be a small store.  Often, they are located at the intersection  - at the corner of two streets.

I get to the market and I pick up some food.  “I pi ck up some French bread,” which is a type of bread, I pick up “a bag of apple s,” I get “a few bananas, some pasta,” because I love pasta, some “tomato sauce,” for my pasta, “and a cooked chicken.”  In many American supermarkets, you can b uy a small chicken that is already cooked for you, so you can just take it hom e and eat it.  If you are lazy, like me, this is a very good way to get some good f ood, and it is not very expensive.  I think it's about maybe six or seven d ollars for a cooked chicken.  I like to take the chicken and put it into the pasta and tomato sauce and mix them all together.

“Luckily,” the supermarket has “a lot of checkout s tands open.”  A “checkout stand” is the place where you pay for your food.  T he verb “to checkout,” (checkout) means to leave and to pay.  We use that verb when we are talking about the supermarket.  We also use it when we are talking about a hotel.  “I'm going to checkout of the hotel,” that means I'm going to leave the hotel and, I hope, pay.  A “stand” (stand) here just means the p lace where you pay for something.

Well, “I get through the” checkout “line pretty qui ckly” - very quickly.  “I thank the cashier,” (cashier) - the cashier is the person who  takes my money - “and the bagger,” (bagger) - this is the person who puts you r groceries into a bag.  In some stores they do not have baggers; you have to b ag your groceries yourself. Notice we use the word “bag” (bag) as a verb, meani ng to put things into a bag. In American grocery stores you can have either a pa per bag or a plastic bag.

Well, the bagger puts my food into my cart, and I “ push my cart to my car.”  My “cart” (cart) sometimes called a shopping cart, is what you use to move or to take your food to your car - what you put your food into  when you are shopping.  It's a little like a big box - metal box with wheels on it .  So, it helps you move things, you don't have to carry them yourself.

ESL Podcast 8 - The  Commute Home and Running Erran ds

“I open the trunk and load everything up.”  “To loa d up” means to put things into, in this case, your car.  So, if someone says, “I'm going to load up my car,” (load) up, they mean they're going to put the things that they need to put into their car. We often use that verb when we are talking about mo ving something in your car, or going on a trip.

“Just then my wife calls me on my cell phone.  She was going to be a little late” this evening.  She says she is not going to get hom e at her normal time, and so she “asks me to make something for dinner.”  This is not a good idea since I am not a good cook, but I, of course, say yes.  “Tonig ht, I will be the cook” - the person making the food.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regul ar speed.

[Start of story]

It’s five o’clock and it’s quitting time.  I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people in my a rea.  I go to the parking garage and get into my car.  I signal my turn onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp.  I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour.  Traffic is stop-and-go a ll the way from downtown.  I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in fast lan e near La Brea, backing up traffic all the way to Hoover.

# Making Dinner, Eating Dinner

Welcome English as a Second Language Podcast number  9:  Making Dinner, Eating Dinner.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number nine. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, I’ll talk about making and eating dinner. I especially like the eating part. Let’s get started.

[Start of story]

When I get home, I start on dinner right away.  I c lean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make  pasta.  I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot u ntil my wife gets home.  I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high.  W hen the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad.  Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!”  She comes into the kit chen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce.  She stirs the sa uce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad.

I get out the place mats and napkins to set the tab le.  I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us.  About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about  our long day.  My wife says she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course  I help out by drying them. First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil.  Then I dry the  pans, plates, glasses, and silverware.

[End of story]

In this episode, we are making dinner at the beginn ing, “When I get home, I start on dinner right away.”  Once again, we have one of those two-word verbs in English, “I start on dinner,” that means I begin to  prepare dinner.  So, “I start on dinner right away.  I clean off the kitchen counter  after putting away the groceries.”  The “kitchen counter” (counter) is the  place in your kitchen where you have a long, flat top or board where you can prepare food and you can put things on, it's like the table almost.  But usually in a k itchen, you have cabinets or cupboards, where you store things, and on top you h ave a counter.  A “counter”

ESL Podcast 9 -  Making and Eating Dinner, and Wash ing Up

is a general word that refers to the top of somethi ng, usually somewhere where you do something on top of it.  In this case, the k itchen counter is where you prepare food.

Well, “I clean off the kitchen counter after” I put  “away the groceries.”  The “groceries” (groceries) – plural –are the food that  I buy at the market.  We sometimes call a supermarket a grocery store - a pl ace that you buy groceries - buy food that you bring home and prepare and eat at  home.

I decided “to make pasta.”  So, “I preheat the oven  to 375.”  “To preheat” (preheat) really means the same here as to heat, bu t if you look at the instructions for making food, what we would call the “recipe” (recipe) – the recipe for making food, usually it begins, if you are goin g to be cooking something in the oven, by telling you to preheat the oven.  That jus t means to turn it on so that when you are ready, when it is hot, you can put the  food in to cook.  “Pre” (pre) means before or to do something before.

So, “I preheat the oven to 375,” in other words, 37 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I preheat it because I want “to bake the bread and ke ep the chicken hot until my wife gets home.”  “To bake” (bake) is to cook somet hing, usually in an oven.  So, I open the oven door, I put in the bread, I put in the chicken, and then I close the door.  My wife is going to be home late so I want to keep the chicken hot - I want to make sure that it stays hot.

I put some water in a pan. A “pan” is what you use to cook something in.  So, “I put some water in a pan and I turn the burner on hi gh.”  The “burner” (burner) is on top of what we would call your “stove” (stove). Your burners are for cooking food, where you have the heat comes from the bottom  and you put the pan on top of the heat.  So, if you are going to boil some  water - make the water hot - you would put it in a pan and then put it on top of  a burner, and the burner is part of your stove.  Usually, stoves and ovens are one m achine, one - in one single piece in many American kitchens.  In my kitchen, the stove is on top of the oven.

I'm going to boil some water.  “To boil” (boil) mea ns to make the one of very hot until you start to see bubbles.  The average temper ature is 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 100 degrees Celsius, in order to boi l water.  Well, “when the water starts boiling” - when it starts to make bubbles be cause it is very hot - “I put in the pasta.”  I take the pasta - the pasta “noodles” (no odles) - the little pieces of pasta, we call those noodles - and I put them into the boi ling water so they can cook.

ESL Podcast 9 -  Making and Eating Dinner, and Wash ing Up

Then I decide I want “to make a salad” because I'm very hungry.  Well, just as I decide to make the salad, “just then, my wife opens  the back door.”  “Just then” - that expression means at that time - at that same t ime - “my wife opens the back door” - the door to the house in the back, the oppo site would be the front door. She yells, “I'm home!”  That's what you would say w hen you come home to someone who is already there, you would say, “I'm h ome!”  You wouldn't say, “I've arrived,” or “I'm here,” you would say, “I'm home.”

My wife comes into the kitchen and helps me chop the tomatoes.  “To chop” (chop) means to cut something into small pieces.  W e chop tomatoes - we make them into smaller pieces - and we add them to the p asta sauce that's the red liquid that we're going to put over the pasta.  My wife “stirs the sauce until it’s done.”  “To stir” (stir) when you are cooking means  to take a spoon and put it into the pan and move the spoon back and forth so that y ou are mixing what is in the pan.

So, my wife is stirring the sauce - the pasta sauce  - the tomato sauce “until it's done” - until it is ready - until it is cooked, “wh ile I finish tossing the salad.”  So, she is stirring the sauce and at the same time, I a m finishing the salad, and I finished by tossing it.  “To toss” (toss) a salad m eans to mix the salad together. In a salad, you often have lettuce and maybe tomato es, other food, other vegetables, and you want to mix them together.  Oft en you put in a salad “dressing” (dressing).  Salad dressing is a liquid,  often made from some oil, that gives a better taste to your salad.  So, you toss the salad in order to mix everything up.

That verb, to toss, can also mean to throw, usually  to throw something to someone else.  Someone may say, “Toss me that pen,”  they mean throw me that pen.

Well, I am “tossing the salad” here - mixing it up,  “I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table.”  The “place (place) mats  (mats)” are things that you put underneath the plate and the spoon, fork, and knife  so that the table doesn't get dirty; we call those place mats.  They can be plast ic; they can be made out of cloth, and they are used to protect your table.

So, “I get out the place mats and the napkins to se t the table.”  A “napkin” (napkin) is like a little towel that you use.  In c ase you need to wipe your face while you are eating, you can use your napkin, and it's common in American restaurants and in houses for people to put the nap kin on their legs while they are sitting - on the top of their legs, which we wo uld call the “lap” - on your “lap”

ESL Podcast 9 -  Making and Eating Dinner, and Wash ing Up

(lap) you put the napkin while you are eating.  “To  set” (set) the table means to put all of the things that you need on the table - plates, spoons, knives, forks, and so forth.  That is to set the table - to make the t able ready so you can eat.

“About 15 minutes” after I set the table, my wife a nd I sit at the table - “we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about  our long day.”  The “dining room” (dining) is a place where you eat.  “To dine”  as a verb, (dine) means to eat. So, the dining room is the room in your house where  you eat your meals.  My wife and I “talk about our long day,” meaning we ha d many things happen today, and maybe we are very tired, so we had a long day.

“My wife says that she’ll do the dishes.”  “To do the dishes” means the same as to wash the dishes.  My wife offers to “do the dish es” because “I cooked, but of course,” since I am a wonderful husband, “I help ou t by drying” the dishes.  “To help out” means the same here as to help.  But if w e are talking about helping another person do something, maybe something that w e don't have to do, but we want to be nice, we would say we help them out.

So, I helped my wife out by drying the dishes.  “Fi rst,' I have to “put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container.”  “Leftovers” (leftovers) – all one word – is extra food - food that you did not eat.  At the end  of your dinner - at the end of your meal - if you want to keep some of that food, we call it leftovers.  And in this case, I'm going to put the leftovers into a small p lastic box that has a top on it. We call that kind of little box a “container” (cont ainer).  We usually refer to these plastic boxes that we put food in as Tupperware con tainers.  “Tupperware” (Tupperware) is actually a company that makes these  small plastic containers for food.  Even if you don't have a container made by t hat company, many people just call it “my Tupperware” - the Tupperware conta iners – that means the plastic boxes that you can put food into.

Well, some of the food, I put in a plastic wrap.  A  “plastic wrap” (wrap) is a thin, clear piece of plastic that I put food into, and we  call it a “wrap” (wrap) because we put it around something.  To wrap something is to put something around it, usually to keep it cold, or to keep it warm, or to keep it fresh when we are talking about food.  We use that same word, wrap, for putti ng paper around a present or a gift that you are giving someone.  The paper is c alled wrapping paper.

You can also put food in aluminum foil.  “Aluminum”  (aluminum) is a kind of metal.  It's usually a silver color.  “Foil” (foil)  is like a plastic wrap but it's made from aluminum.  It's a - it's like a long, flat she et that you can put around

ESL Podcast 9 -  Making and Eating Dinner, and Wash ing Up

something to keep the food in your refrigerator or in your freezer, where you have even colder temperatures. At the end of the story, I dry the pans, the plates , the glasses, and the silverware. The silverware, remember, is the spoon, knife, fork  that you use when you eat.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regul ar speed.

[Start of story]

When I get home, I start on dinner right away.  I c lean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make  pasta.  I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot u ntil my wife gets home.  I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high.  W hen the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad.  Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!”  She comes into the kit chen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce.  She stirs the sa uce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad.

# Relaxing, Reading the Mail, and the Trash

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 10: Relaxing, Reading the Mail, and the Trash

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number ten. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, the ninth of our 10-part special s eries on daily English, I’ll talk about relaxing, reading the mail, and taking out the trash. Let’s get started.

[Start of story]

With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit  down on the couch to chill out and watch the national news which comes on at 6 :30.  During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail.  Most of it is junk ma il and bills.  There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area.  I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages.

I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch reali ty shows.  One thing I hate is having to watch all of the commercials, so I turn the sound down when they come on.  After the show is over, I thumb through the la test issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while my wife reads a novel by her favorit e mystery writer.

At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day,  so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well.  I  roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come  by early in the morning.

[End of story]

We begin with the sentence “With the dinner dishes done.” The dinner dishes are the dishes we use to eat our dinner, and when I say  they are done, I mean that they are washed and dried.  So, with the dinner dis hes washed and dried, “My wife and I sit down on the couch to chill out.”  “T o chill (chill) out (out) – two words – means to relax.  Sometimes we use this expression  as a command.  If someone is very excited, you may say, “Hey, chill o ut,” means relax, don't be so excited.  You will also hear just the word chill.  “Hey, chill,” that's informal for relax, don't be so excited.  You will also hear peo ple say, “I'm just chilling.”  I am just chilling means I'm just relaxing.  Again, that 's very informal.

ESL Podcast 10 - Relaxing, the Mail, and the Trash

 Well, my wife and I are chilling, and we're watchin g the national news.  The “national news” is the news broadcast on television , and in Los Angeles, this is at 6:30 in the evening - it comes on at 6:30.  When we  say a television show “comes on,” we mean that that is when it begins - t hat is when you can watch it. The national news can also be called a “newscast” ( newscast). A newscast is a news program.  You could have a local newscast, wit h just news about Los Angeles, for me, or a national newscast.

Well, “During the newscast, I sort through the day’ s mail.”  “To sort (sort) through,” means that I am looking at today's mail a nd usually I am separating it so that I separate the different kinds of mail - the different kinds of letters - that I got that day.

Most of my mail - and this is true - is either junk  mail or bills.  “Junk (junk) mail” is mail that you get that you don't want.  Usually it is advertisements, people trying to get you to buy something; we call that junk mail .  Most of my mail is either junk mail or it's “bills.” And a “bill” is a statement -  a piece of paper from some company that you have to pay money to.  You get a b ill for your electricity, for your phone, for your Internet access.  You have to pay your bills.  Well, you should pay your bills; maybe you don't.

“There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area.”  A “flier” (flier) – the plural is fliers, with an “s” – is an advertisement  - it's an announcement or an advertisement.  Usually it's one or two pages - one  or two pieces of paper. Sometimes the advertisements, or the fliers, are fo lded up.  And, it's very popular for people who are selling houses to use fliers tha t they mail you or they put on your house - outside of your house.  These fliers a re for houses that people are selling - “houses for sale in the area.”

“I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages.”  “I check” - I look out at “the front stoop.”  “A stoop” (stoop) is the  stairs in front of your house. Often this word is used when we are talking about l arge buildings - apartment buildings or condominium buildings.  In New York or  Boston, some of the cities on the eastern coast of the United States, people t alk about sitting on the stoop, that mean you're sitting on your stairs.  But, you can also use the word to talk about your own stairs in front of your house.  The top of those stairs is where you might find packages.  A “package” (package) is usua lly a box or something that is bigger than just a regular letter that you receive in the mail or that is delivered to you by some private company.

ESL Podcast 10 - Relaxing, the Mail, and the Trash

 Well, I look at my stoop and I see “there are no pa ckages” - no one loves me; no one sent me a package.  I then talk about how I lik e to watch television, and so does my wife.  “My wife likes to watch reality show s.”  A “reality show” (reality) is a type of television show where they have a competi tion or a contest.  “Big Brother” and “American Idol” are two examples of po pular reality shows.  They take people - average people, they say - and they h ave a competition or a contest.

“One thing I hate” about watching television - some thing I don't like - “is having to watch all the commercials.”  A “commercial” is the same as an advertisement on television or radio; it's an announcement from a co mpany that wants you to buy what they are selling.  Well, I don't like watching  the commercials, “so I turn the sound down.”  “To turn the sound down” means to low er the volume, to make it so that it is less loud - it is quieter.  “I turn the sound down when” the commercials “come on.”  Again, that verb, “to come on,” means that they are on the television - that they start.

“After the show is over,” - after the show is done - finished - “I thumb through the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly.”  “The Atlant ic Monthly” is a monthly magazine in the United States.  “To thumb through s omething” – (thumb) through – two words – means to look through something, but usually not to be paying too much attention.  You're sort of looking but you're not necessarily reading very carefully.  We use that expression – that verb – wh en we are talking about magazines in particular.  You're looking at them, p erhaps waiting in a doctor's office - in the waiting room of a doctor's office y ou thumb through the magazines. Well, I'm thumbing through the Atlantic Monthly, an d my wife is reading a novel. A “novel” (novel) is a fictional book - a book that  is not a true story.

“At around 9,” that is at 9 p.m., “I remember that tomorrow is trash day.”  “Trash” (trash) is anything that you are getting rid of - t hat you are throwing out - that you don't want anymore, and trash day is the day that the garbage trucks come by and take the trash away.  Now, in Los Angeles we ha ve a public trash service, so that the government has trucks that it sends out, a nd it picks up your trash - it takes your trash and puts it into the truck, and th en takes it away.  That is trash day.  In my neighborhood it is on Fridays and every  neighborhood is different, they do a different part of the city each day.

So, this is trash day and I need to “take the kitch en garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well.”  The “garbage” (garbage) is just another word for trash.

ESL Podcast 10 - Relaxing, the Mail, and the Trash

We sometimes talk about garbage that is trash in the kitchen in particular.  This is the kitchen garbage, and I have to take it out, mea ning I have to take the bag and put it outside so that the garbage truck can come b y and pick it up.

In Los Angeles, and in many cities, we also have re cycling bins.  “To recycle” (recycle) means to use again, and in Los Angeles, w e have a recycling bin where you can put your newspapers and other things that they can use again - they can recycle.  A “bin” (bin) is just another name for a box, usually a plastic box.

In my city, we have trash containers that you can r oll; they have little wheels on them.  A container is like a big box that you put s omething in, and so a trash container is a big, in my case, plastic box that ha s wheels that I can then put it down on the street.  You have to put your trash con tainers on the street.

Each container has a different color.  In my case, black is the color for trash; blue is the color for recycling trash, so newspapers, for example; and green is where you put things like leaves and grass, things that y ou have in your - outside of your house that you want to get rid of, that are pl ants, that sort of thing.

I put the trash containers out on the street becaus e the garbage trucks “come by early in the morning.”  They “come by,” a two-word verb, which means that they come to your house - they drive to your house.  And , in my neighborhood, they come by very early, so at six o'clock on Friday mor ning I can hear the trucks outside my window.  I don't like it, but I need to have my trash taken away, so one day of the week I wake up early because I can h ear the garbage trucks outside.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a nativ e rate of speech.

[Start of story]

With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit  down on the couch to chill out and watch the national news which comes on at 6 :30.  During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail.  Most of it is junk ma il and bills.  There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area.  I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages.

I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch reali ty shows.  One thing I hate is having to watch all of the commercials, so I turn the sound down when they come

ESL Podcast 10 - Relaxing, the Mail, and the Trash

on.  After the show is over, I thumb through the la test issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while my wife reads a novel by her favorit e mystery writer.

At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day,  so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well.  I  roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come  by early in the morning.

# Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 11: Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e number eleven. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, the last of our 10-part special se ries on daily English, I’ll talk about getting ready for bed and going to sleep.

Let’s get started!

[Start of story]

At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed.  When I wa s little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.  I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap.  I wash  my face, and dry it with my towel.  I floss and brush my teeth.  I have to admi t that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife.  She cleans up when I’ve finished up .

In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get un dressed.  I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas.  Wea ring my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night.  I pull back the covers, fluff my pillow , and climb into bed.  I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead lig ht.  I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight.  Some nig hts I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any she ep.  I nod off right away and before long, I’m fast asleep.

[End of story]

This episode is called "Getting Ready for Bed and G oing to Sleep."

"At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed," to do the things I need to do so I can go to sleep.  "When I was little, my mother would read  me a bedtime story." “Bedtime” (bedtime) – all one word – is, of course,  the time that you go to bed - that you go to your bed so you can sleep.  A bedtim e story is a story you would

ESL Podcast 11 - Getting Ready for Bed and Going to  Sleep

tell a child to help them fall asleep.  Many childr en like to be told a bedtime story. These are often what we would call “fairy tales” (f airy) “tales” (tales).  A “tale” is just another word for a story, and a fairy tale is a story about something that isn't true, usually with imaginary characters.

"I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday."  "I’m looking forward to having that ritual." A “ritual” (ritual)  is something that you do on a regular schedule or at a regular time every day or maybe every week or every month, and you do the exact same things in the exac t same order.  We also use that word, ritual, when we are talking about some r eligious ceremonies.  Some religious events have certain rules - certain order  - a certain order that they follow, and that is a ritual.

"I go into the bathroom and I turn on the tap."  the “tap” (tap) is the same as the faucet.  Well, you turn on the tap so the water com es out. "I wash my face, and dry it with my towel."  I dry my face - I make it d ry using a “towel” (towel) which is a cloth that you use to dry yourself, or to clean y ourself.  I floss my teeth and I brush them.

"I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat."  "I have to admit" is an expression that we use when you're going to say something that  maybe you don't want to say - you don't want to tell the truth.  In fact, there's also an expression, "to tell the truth."  So, I have to admit means I have to say - to tell the truth.  "By this time," meaning by 10:30 - "by this time, I’m beat."   To be beat, "beat," means to be very tired.  Someone says, "Oh, I'm beat," they' ve been working all day or they've, like me, been watching television all day,  and now I'm beat - I'm tired.  Of course, I don't watch television all day, just part  of the day!

Well, my wife is also beat.  In the story I say, "I 'm beat, and so is my wife," meaning my wife is also very tired.  "She cleans up  when I’ve finished up."  Once again, you see those two-word verbs.  To clean up i s, in this case, to clean your face, to brush your teeth; to get yourself clean is  to clean up.  “To finish up” is really the same as to finish, but we love in Englis h to use those prepositions as part of these two word verbs.  So, I finish up, mea ning I finish doing what I need to do, and then my wife goes into the bathroom and cleans up.

"In the meantime," meaning while my wife is doing t hat. "In the meantime" (meantime) – all one word – I walk into the bedroom  and get undressed."  So, when my wife is in the bathroom, "I walk" - at the same time - "into the bedroom and I get undressed."  “To get undressed” is the op posite of to get dressed.  So, if you get undressed, you take off your clothes.

ESL Podcast 11 - Getting Ready for Bed and Going to  Sleep

 "I put my dirty clothes" - the clothes I was wearin g - "in the hamper and I put on my pajamas."  A “hamper” (hamper) as a noun, is a p lace, usually in your bedroom or bathroom, where you put dirty clothes or  dirty towels; we call that a hamper.  “To hamper,” as a verb, means something di fferent.  “To hamper someone” means to get in their way - to prevent the m from doing something.  But as a noun, a hamper, or a clothes hamper, is a plac e, usually it's a big plastic box with a top on it, or it could be made of wood, and that's where you put your dirty clothes.  And then, at some point during the week, I hope, you wash your clothes so you can have clean clothes again.  Unless, of co urse, you're not married, in which case, if you are a man and single, you may no t wash your clothes that much.

Well, I have "my dirty clothes in my hamper," and s ince I don't have any clothes on, remember I have undressed, "I put on my pajamas ."  “Pajamas” (pajamas) are sometimes abbreviated as “PJs” (PJ) – PJs.  You r pajamas, or PJs, are the clothes that you wear when you are going to bed.  F or example, I have pajamas that say Superman on it, and I wear my Superman paj amas to bed.  Doesn't everyone?

Well, in addition to putting on my pajamas, I also put on my slippers.  A “slipper” (slipper) is a shoe that you wear usually just insi de the house.  So, when you are getting ready for bed and you want to walk around the house, you don't put your shoes on, you would put some slippers on.  Some peo ple wear slippers in their house, especially if the floors are cold, and they' ll put the slippers on at night and have them on at night as they walk around in their house or in the morning.

Well, "Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water," and I want to put that water "next to my bed in case I ne ed it during the night."  So, if I need to drink water at night, I have a glass of wat er next to me.  "I pull back the covers."  The “covers” (covers) are the blanket, the comforter, and the top sheets.  We take those things and we have to pull them back.  To pull back means to take them and move them towards the bottom  of the bed so that you can get in, and after you get in, you're going to p ull the covers up.  So, you pull back the covers to get into the bed, and then you p ull them up to cover you again so you can stay warm.

"I pull back my covers," and I "fluff my pillow."  The pillow is what I put my head on.  “To fluff” (fluff) means to make your pillow b igger by hitting it very softly on the sides.  So, you take your pillow and you put on e hand on each side of the pillow and you move your hands back and forth towar d each other and away

ESL Podcast 11 - Getting Ready for Bed and Going to  Sleep

from each other, and that allows the pillow to be a  little bigger - to be a little softer.

"I fluff my pillow, and I climb into bed."  Notice that verb “to climb” (climb) into bed.  It means the same as to get into bed.  We mig ht use that particular verb, to climb into, if we are very tired, for example.  You  can also use it just to mean to get into bed.

So, I "climb into bed.  I set my alarm clock for 6: 15," - for 6:15 in the morning, of course - "and I turn off the overhead light."  The “overhead” (overhead) – all one word – is a light that is on the top of your room -  on the ceiling of the room.  The top of the room is called the “ceiling” (ceiling).  So, an overhead light is on the top of the ceiling - or on the ceiling, and I turn the overhead light off.

"I lay my head down."  “To lay” (lay) here means to  put something down.  Usually we use that verb when we are talking about people o r a part of your body.  "I lay my head down and I pull up the covers," so I am war m, and because I'm such a great husband, I kiss "my wife goodnight."  “To kis s someone goodnight,” means to kiss them and in a sense, to say goodnight to th em.  "Some nights I have trouble falling asleep."  “To fall (fall) asleep (a sleep)” means to go to sleep - to start sleeping.

Sometimes "I have trouble falling asleep, but tonig ht, I didn’t need to count any sheep."  The expression “to count sheep” (sheep) is  used because we traditionally when we are trying to fall asleep, so me people say that it helps if you try counting numbers, so you start with one, two, t hree, four.  And, for some reason, I don't know why, it is traditional to coun t sheep.  Sheep are a type of animal.  A sheep is an animal that you take the hai r off of, and you use the hair of the sheep to make clothing, for example.  I don't n eed to count sheep because I'm very tired.  If you are not tired or you have d ifficulty falling asleep, you might want to try counting sheep.  One, two, three, four,  and by the time you reach five million you should be asleep!

"I nod off right away."  “To nod (nod) off” – two w ords – means the same as to fall asleep.  It's just another way of saying fall aslee p, "I nod off."  Sometimes people will use that expression when they're at a meeting and it is very boring at work, and you may say to someone, "I almost nodded off" -  I almost fell asleep.  That usually happens to my students when I am teaching.

"Before long," meaning in a very short time – "befo re long, I’m fast asleep."  “To be fast (fast) asleep” means to be completely aslee p.  There's a similar

ESL Podcast 11 - Getting Ready for Bed and Going to  Sleep

expression that means the same, “to be sound asleep ” (sound).  “To be sound asleep” means that you are sleeping completely, it will not be easy to wake you up.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a nativ e rate of speech.

[Start of story]

At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed.  When I wa s little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.  I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap.  I wash  my face, and dry it with my towel.  I floss and brush my teeth.  I have to admi t that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife.  She cleans up when I’ve finished up .

In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get un dressed.  I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas.

# Small Talk About the Weather

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 12 – Small Talk.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  12. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s topic is going to be “small talk” – talking  about things that aren’t very important. Let’s get started. > I admit that I'm not very good at small talk. When I'm with friends, I can just shoot the breeze all day long. But when I talk to a stran ger or someone I don't know very well, I'm always casting about, searching for something to talk about. Politics and religion are definitely taboo subjects, at leas there in the United States. But you have to chat about something, otherwise there a re these uncomfortable silences.
> So we end up talking about - what else? - the weath er. This usually begins with something like, "So, nice weather we've been having !" or "It sure is a warm one out there today." Of course, we have to comment  on the temperature. My favorite is, "It's not the heat that's so bad, it's  the humidity!" Actually, I think that's true - I hate it most when it's muggy outside.
> Back in my home state of Minnesota, everyone is obs essed with the weather report! Every TV station has its own meteorologist with a high-tech radar giving you the 5 day forecast. They tell you when the temp erature is rising or falling, what kind of clouds are moving in, and how cold the  wind chill is.
> My favorite quote about the weather comes from Mark  Twain, who once said, that everybody talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it!

I begin our story by saying that “I admit that I'm not very good at small talk.” “Small talk” is an expression we use to describe th ings we say to someone just to fill time. “Small talk” is always about something t hat isn't really very important. It could be the weather. It could be a movie that you' ve seen recently – anything that isn't controversial, that’s not going to get y ou into a fight with that person. We use small talk often with strangers – people we don 't know. I said that, “When I'm

with friends, I can just shoot the breeze all day l ong.” The expression “to shoot the breeze” (breeze) is an informal one, which mean s to talk about lots of different things but nothing, again, very important . It's a little different than small talk. Small talk is almost always with someone who perhaps isn’t very close to you, someone you don't know very well. “To shoot the breeze” just means to talk a lot about something usually with a close friend. I say, “I can shoot the breeze all day long,” meaning for a very long time. “When I ta lk to a stranger or someone I don't know very well,” I continue, “I'm always cast ing about searching for something to talk about.” “To cast (cast) about” me ans to look for something. It could be a physical object. I'm casting about for n ew pen, or it could be, as in the case of the story here, a topic that I want to talk  about. I say, “I’m always casting about searching for something to talk about.” I con tinue by saying that “Politics and religion are definitely taboo subjects, at leas there in the United States.” A “taboo” (taboo) is a subject that is considered ina ppropriate to talk about, not something you should talk about, something that is even forbidden. You're not supposed to talk about it. To talk about politics a nd religion – two things that people often disagree about – is considered taboo i n the United States. Those are taboo subjects. We don't usually talk about tho se with strangers. We often don't talk about them with family either, if your f amily doesn't agree with your politics or your religion.

I continued by saying that, “You have to chat about  something. Otherwise, there are these uncomfortable silences.” The verb “to cha t” (chat) just means to talk to someone in an informal environment, an informal sit uation. The verb “to chat” is usually used when things being discussed are not ve ry important. You're not talking about anything very important. You're just chatting. You’re just talking. It could also be used to mean the same as shooting the  breeze. I say that, “If you don't chat about something, there will be uncomfort able silences.” You know what happens, when you're talking to someone and ne ither of you can think of something to say and then there's just silence. No one is talking. If that goes on for too long, it could be uncomfortable. It could make you feel a little strange, like something is wrong. I continue in the story by sayi ng that “We end up talking about – what else? The weather.” “We end up” means after a certain time, this is what happens. We talk about the weather. I continue , “This usually begins with something like, ‘So, nice weather we've been having ,’ or ‘It sure is a warm one out there today.’” These are expressions that you m ight use as small talk. However, because they're so common now, because eve ryone uses them, some people use it almost as a joke. To say that means t hat you can't think of anything better to say. A little less common and perhaps, a better choice in this situation is an expression such as, “It sure is a warm one out there today,” or you could say, “It sure is a cold one out there today.” You're say ing it's very cold out. You’re talking about the weather to allow the other person  to give his or her comments.

Again, it's something that people aren’t going to a rgue about. They’re not going to have a fight about whether it's cold or warm out . Most people will agree one or the other.

“Of course,” I say, “I had to comment on the temper ature” – how cold or hot it was. I say that, “My favorite,” that is, my favorit e expression, is, “It's not the heat that’s so bad, it's the humidity.” This is an old e xpression, maybe in many countries but certainly in the United States. When people complain during the summertime about the weather being hot, they'll oft en say, “Well, it's not the high temperature that's the problem. It's the humidity.”  It's the amount of water in the air that makes you feel uncomfortable. “It's not the heat. It's the humidity,” we say. I then say in the story that that's true. I ha te it most when it's muggy outside. “To be muggy,” (muggy) means to be very humid. If y ou are in Florida, in southern Florida, for example, it will be very mugg y in July and August. The temperature will be very high and there will be hig h humidity, a lot of water in the air.

I'm originally from Minnesota in the north central part of the United States and there, I say, “Everyone is obsessed with the weathe r report.” “To be obsessed” (obsessed) means to be concerned about one thing, t ypically one thing only. That's all you talk about. That's all you think abo ut. I say that “Minnesotans are obsessed with the weather report.” The “weather rep ort” is when you listen to the news or read the newspaper and you find out what the weather is going to be today or tomorrow or this week. So, report here, re ally means news report, report about what the weather is going to be like. I say t hat, “Every TV station has its own meteorologist.” A “meteorologist” is someone wh o goes to school to study meteorology, that is the weather – the science of the weather. You could call it. I say that, “Every TV station has its own meteorologi st, with a high-tech radar giving you the five-day forecast.” “High tech” mean s very high technology, very sophisticated, very expensive. When we talk about the TV station giving you the five day forecast, I mean they're telling you what the weather will be in the next five days. A “forecast” (forecast) is a prediction about what will happen, obviously what will happen in the future. I say that, “They t ell you” – “they,” meaning the meteorologists – “when the temperature is rising” –  is going up – “or falling” – is going down. They tell you what kinds of clouds are moving in. “To move in,” here means to arrive. What kind of clouds are arriving f rom a different part of the country. The phrasal verb “to move-in” can also mea n to go and live with someone, but we’re not talking about that. We’re ta lking about the weather.

Meteorologists in Minnesota will also tell you, at least, during the wintertime, how cold the wind chill is. “Wind chill” (chill) is use d to tell you how cold it feels on your skin, not always how cold the temperature is. So, if it's 10 degrees below

zero – 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit – it’s very  cold. But if there's also a wind, a strong wind, the wind may make it seem even  colder. It will feel colder. And so, there is a way of estimating a figuring out  what's called a “wind chill” – how cold it feels typically on your skin – when you  are out in a cold temperature with the wind blowing. I end by saying that, “My fa vorite quote about the weather is from Mark Twain.” Mark Twain is a famous America n author, what we would call a humorist. He was a novelist but he was also a very funny man. He says, or once said, that “Everybody talks about the weather but no one does anything about it.” People talk about the weather but of cou rse, they don't change the weather. That's normally something we can’t do.

Now let’s listen to this story this time, at a normal speed. > I admit that I'm not very good at small talk. When I'm with friends, I can just shoot the breeze all day long. But when I talk to a stran ger or someone I don't know very well, I'm always casting about, searching for something to talk about. Politics and religion are definitely taboo subjects, at leas there in the United States. But you have to chat about something, otherwise there a re these uncomfortable silences.
> So we end up talking about - what else? - the weath er. This usually begins with something like, "So, nice weather we've been having !" or "It sure is a warm one out there today." Of course, we have to comment  on the temperature. My favorite is, "It's not the heat that's so bad, it's  the humidity!" Actually, I think that's true - I hate it most when it's muggy outside.

# Going to the Drugstore

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 13: Going to the Drugstore.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 13. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to go to the pharmacy or drugstore. Let’s get started! > I stopped by the drugstore last night on my way bac k home from work. I had a few toiletries to pick up, as well as my prescripti on. Fortunately, the chain pharmacy where I go has a little bit of e verything: food, greeting cards, magazines – it’s almost as big as a regular superma rket.
> To begin with, I needed to get some medications for  my allergies. I've got hay fever, so I'm sneezing up a storm every morning whe n I wake up. While I was at it, I also got some antacids and some Band-Aids. No w it was time to pick up my refill.
> I stood in line for a few minutes before being wait ed on. Since it was not a new prescription, the pharmacist didn't have to do a co nsultation with me. I just gave the clerk my insurance card and she rang up the sal e. Fortunately, I have a low co-pay, so my HMO foots most of the bill.

Now let’s talk about some of the words we used in o ur discussion of going to the drugstore. Let’s start with that term “drugstore.” A “drugstore” is the same as a “pharmacy.” We could say that the word “drugstore” is synonymous with pharmacy. It means the same thing.

I said that I “stopped by” the drugstore last night . “To stop by” means that you are going somewhere, but before you go to that place, y ou go somewhere else first. For example, I was going to my friend’s house over in Beverly Hills, and, on my way there, I stopped by a store in West Los Angeles  to pick up a bottle of wine. “To stop by somewhere, then, means to go somewhere before you go

somewhere else. It implies that you may or may not have been planning on doing that.

I said that I was coming back from work. I said, “I  was on my way home.” “To be on your way” means to be going in that direction. I ’m on my way to the store, for example. Now, normally we use the preposition “to” after the phrase “on your way,” but the word “home” is an exception. There’s no “to.” You just say, “I was on my way home.” For most other places, however, yo u have to add a “to” after the phrase “on my way,” such as “I am on my way to the hospital” or “I am on my way to buy a nice big hamburger.” Oh, that sounds g ood!

I said that I had to pick up some “toiletries.” “To iletries” (toiletries) refers to anything that you would use in your bathroom. The w ord “toilet” and “bathroom” are often used to mean the same thing in the United  States. Technically, of course, “toilet” is just the thing you use to do, w ell, what you normally do in a restroom or bathroom.

I said I had to “pick up” some toiletries. “To pick  up” means to buy, to obtain, to get. It’s a two-word phrasal verb – “to pick up.” O ne of the things I had to get was my “prescription.” A “prescription” (prescription) is what the doctor gives you for some illness or some sickness. A prescription drug is something that you can only get with the doctor’s note, and that note is c alled a “prescription.” But we often use the term prescription to indicate both the drug as well as the note or piece of paper the doctor has to sign, or put his s ignature on.

I said that the pharmacy I went to was a “chain pha rmacy.” When we talk about a “chain (chain) store,” we mean that there is more t han one of these stores. There’s more than one “branch” (branch). So McDonal d’s is a “chain’ restaurant, because there are thousands of branches, or in this  case, restaurants, that are called McDonald’s. They all belong to the same comp any or group of owners.

Here in Southern California, there are many chain g rocery stores. You can also have chain bookstores or a chain shoe store, or for  any kind of business that sells things. You can even have a chain service bus iness, such as a place that cleans clothes or cuts your hair.

I said that the pharmacy had a little bit of everyt hing, including “greeting cards.” “Greeting cards” is a general term that means any s ort of card that you would buy for someone to give them for some special reason, s ome special occasion. It could be a birthday card, a Christmas card, an anni versary card, or any type of special event card. A greeting card could also be f or someone you love. I used to give my wife greeting cards all the time to say how  much I love her. I still do,

being the good husband that I am, right? Anyway, al l of these are called “greeting cards.”

But I didn’t go to the drugstore to buy greeting ca rds. I went to there to get some “medications.” The term “medications” (medications)  simply refers a type of drug. There are two basic kinds of medication you can buy  in a drugstore or pharmacy. There are prescription medications, which require p ermission from your doctor, and there are “over-the-counter” medications. “Over -the-counter medications” are medications or drugs that you can buy that you do n ot need a doctor’s prescription for. Examples of over-the-counter drug s include cold medicines, cough medicine, medicine for your stomach, and cert ain pain killers, things you take for when you have a headache. Sometimes we cal l these by their initials, “OTC,” meaning “over-the-counter.”

I said that I needed to get some medications for my  “allergies.” “Allergies” (allergies) are when your body reacts to different things it eats or smells or touches. It’s a negative reaction. You can have an allergy to animals, like dogs or cats. I, for example, have a cat allergy. So, whene ver I’m close to a cat, I sneeze - “Achoo!” that’s a sneeze. That’s an allergy or an  “allergic reaction.” You can have other kinds of allergic reactions. Some proble m may appear on your skin. You may have red bumps on your skin, red marks on y our skin. That might also be a reaction to something that you ate or smelled or touched. You can have an allergy to certain kinds of plants. You can have al lergies to different foods. I also have an allergy to crab and lobster, which is too b ad, because I used to love eating that kind of food but I can’t anymore. I dev eloped an allergy as an adult.

Another type of allergy is called “hay fever.” “Hay  (hay) fever” is an allergy to different plants and, well, I have that, too. My wi fe thinks I have an allergy to work as well. That’s probably true.

Well, when I have hay fever, I sneeze. I said I was  “sneezing up a storm.” “To sneeze up a storm” means to sneeze a lot. A “storm”  is normally when you have a lot of rain or a lot of wind. So, “to sneeze up a  storm” is a metaphor, an expression that we use comparing one thing to anoth er.

I said that “While I was at it, I also got some ant acids and some Band-Aids.” This expression “while I was at it” means since I was do ing something at the same time, that was in the same place, or that was someh ow similar, I did something else. For example, you may say, “Could you go to the store and buy me some milk? And while you’re at it, could you also get me  some cereal for breakfast?” So “while you’re at it” means “while you’re also do ing something else, please do this as well.”

 I said that, “While I was at it, I also got some An tacids.” “Antacids” (antacids) are to help your stomach when you are not feeling well when you eat something that makes your stomach feel weird, feel funny, or makes  your stomach hurt. You could take an antacid. I also mentioned buying “Ban d-Aids.” “Band-Aids” is technically a brand of bandages in the United State s. A “brand” (brand) means one particular company owns and uses the rights to that name. “Apple,” for example, is a brand of computers. “Coca-Cola” is a brand of soda pop.

There is a brand of bandages is called “Band-Aids.”  But they’re so popular that now, many of us call almost all bandages “Band-Aids ,” even when they’re made by a different company. There are different compani es that make bandages. Bandages are things you would put on your skin. For  example, if you cut yourself, you would put a bandage or a Band-Aid on to protect the area where you cut your skin.

I said I had to pick up a “refill.” A “refill” (ref ill) is a prescription that the doctor says you can get more than once or a drug that you can take multiple times – many times. So, for example, I have a prescription for my allergies, and I have five “refills.” That means I can go back to the pha rmacy after I wait a few weeks, usually, and get a bottle of the allergy medicine. I can do that five times. I have five refills. After that, I have to go back to the doctor to get another prescription to get more drugs. So, “to refill a prescription” mean s to get more of a drug that you have already taken before.

I said I stood in line for a few minutes before bei ng “waited on.” That expression “to stand in line” means to be in line. “To be wait ed on” is an expression you often hear in a restaurant, but we also use the phr ase for any sort of service situation, any place where someone is going to help  you, such as in a store or at the post office.

I said that the pharmacist didn’t have to do a cons ultation with me. A “pharmacist“ is the person who, of course works at a pharmacy. We used to have a term, “druggist” (druggist), to refer to someone who worked at a drugstore, but now, you normally just hear the word “pharmacist.” To become a pharmacist, you have to go to a special kind of medical school call ed a “pharmacy school” where you will get a degree in pharmacy. You need that to  dispense drugs. “To dispense” (dispense) means to give out, usually to give out a drug or some kind of medicine. When you have a new prescription, when  you’re using a drug for the first time, the pharmacist will have “consultation”  with you. A “consultation” just means that they tell you what the drug is, what you  should use it for, and how

you should use it. In our story, I am not picking u p a new prescription drug. I’m picking up a refill so I don’t need a consultation.

I said that “I gave the clerk my insurance card and  she rang up the sale.” The term “clerk” means anyone who works at a store, usu ally the person who takes your money, the person who, as I say in the story, “rings up” your sale. “To ring up a sale” means to process the sale, to take your money, to put the money into what’s called a “cash register,” which is the place  where the store keeps its money. The clerk will also give you a receipt for y our purchase, for the things that you bought, usually a little piece of paper, althou gh nowadays, some stores say they can email you your receipt. I’ve had that happ en, at least once or twice.

I also said that I had a “low co-pay.” “Co-pay” sta nds for “co-payment.” When you have medical insurance in the United States, usuall y you have to pay a small amount of money every time you go to the doctor and  every time you pick up a prescription. It’s not the same amount you would pa y if you did not have insurance. It’s always less than that. The insuranc e company pays for most of the cost of the drug or most of the cost of the doc tor’s visit. But you usually have to pay maybe five, ten, perhaps twenty dollars of the cost of the drug or of the visit. That’s called a “co-pay.”

I said that “My HMO foots most of the bill.” “HMO” stands for “Health Maintenance Organization.” In the United States, an  “HMO” is a private company that provides you, that gives you, medical service.  They have doctors, they have hospitals, they have pharmacies, and you buy insura nce so that you can be a member of the “HMO.” Not everyone is a member of an  “HMO.” Many people in the United States can’t afford, do not have money f or, the private insurance, so they have to go to a public clinic or hospital.

I said that my HMO “foots most of the bill.” “To fo ot (foot) the bill” means to pay for, to take care of the expense or the cost. “Who’ s going to foot the bill for tonight’s dinner?” That means “Who’s going to pay f or tonight’s dinner?” It’s an informal expression. (And, no, I’m not going to foo t the bill for dinner tonight!)

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a normal  speed.

[start of story]

I stopped by the drugstore last night on my way bac k home from work. I had a few toiletries to pick up, as well as my prescripti on. Fortunately, the chain pharmacy where I go has a little bit of e verything: food, greeting cards, magazines – it’s almost as big as a regular superma rket.

 To begin with, I needed to get some medications for  my allergies. I've got hay fever, so I'm sneezing up a storm every morning whe n I wake up. While I was at it, I also got some antacids and some Band-Aids. No w it was time for me to pick up my refill.

I stood in line for a few minutes before being wait ed on. Since it was not a new prescription, the pharmacist didn't have to do a co nsultation with me. I just gave the clerk my insurance card and she rang up the sal e. Fortunately, I have a low co-pay, so my HMO foots most of the bill.

# Going to the Post Office

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 14 – Going to the Post Office.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 14. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to go to the post offi ce. Let's get started.  > For me, things never go very smoothly at the local post office. I've learned that if you want to mail a letter, you'll have no problems.  But if things get more complicated than that, well, watch out!
> Yesterday I went there to mail a small package and pick up a book of stamps. I wait my turn in line, and when I get up to the wind ow, the clerk says, "What can I do for you?" "Well," I say, "I need a book – no mak e that a roll – of stamps. And I need to send this package priority to San Francisco ." "You want insurance with that?" he asks me. "Uh, I don't know, what do you r ecommend?" "Well," he says, "you can send it priority with tracking if you want  to see when it gets there, you can send it insured if the contents are valuable, o r you can do both."
> "Okay, I'll take the insurance." "Then step aside to fill out the insurance form," he says, "and bring it back up to me when you're finis hed." With that, I was waved aside to fill out my form. "Next in line!" the cler k calls. When I finish filling out the form, I wait patiently until the gentleman being wa ited on in front of me is finished, and then step back up to the window. "Sor ry," the clerk says, "I'm on break now. She can help you at the next window."
> Maybe it would be quicker just to drive my package to San Francisco.

 In talking about my trip to the post office I said  that, “Things never go very smoothly.” “To go smoothly” (smoothly) means to tak e place without problems. For example, if someone asks you, “How did your vis it to the doctor go?” You could say, “Oh, it went smoothly,” meaning I didn't  have any problems. Everything was just fine.

I said that, “If you want to mail a letter at my po st office, you'll have no problems.” “To mail a letter” means to send a letter. A letter  is typically a piece of paper inside of an envelope. “But if things get more comp licated,” I say, “well, watch out.” “Watch out” is an expression we use to mean “ be careful.” What I'm saying here is that if you want to do something other than  mail a letter, which is a very simple thing, then you might have problems.

I continue the story by saying, “Yesterday, I went there to mail a small package and to pick up a book of stamps.” There are two ter ms we use in talking about stamps. One is a “book of stamps” and the other is a “roll (roll) of stamps.” A “book of stamps” is a small, little book, although it's not really a book. Basically, it's a small package of about 20 stamps. A “roll of  stamps” has a hundred stamps, but all of the stamps are connected to each  other and they’re wrapped around until they're in a small circle, what we cal l a “roll.” I said that I wanted to pick up or buy a book of stamps. I also said I want  to mail a small package. A “package” (package) is something you are sending th at is bigger than a simple letter with an envelope. A package is usually in a box, a small box, a large box – any kind of box. You send a package when you are se nding something, usually larger than can fit into a small envelope. Then I b egan to tell the story of what happened exactly at the post office.

When we tell a story in English, we many times, use  something called the historical present, which is the present tense of the verb, even though you are talking about something in the past. “Historical” c omes from “history” – something that has happened already. Even though I'm describi ng something that happened in the past, in this case, it was yesterday, I stil l use the present tense in telling the story. The idea is that, it gives it a little more immediacy. It feels like it's happening right now.

So, in telling the story, I begin by saying, “I wai t my turn in line.” “To wait your turn in line” means to wait for the person in front  of you or the people in front of you, to go first. If there is a line, you have to w ait for the people in front of you who arrived before you did. I say, “I wait my turn in line and when I get up to the window, the clerk says to me, “What can I do for yo u?’’ The “window” here is not a window on the side of a building or a house that you look outside through. A “window” here just means the place where the person  working for the post office, the clerk, stands in order to help you. You go up to this person who’s standing usually behind what we would call a “counter.” It’s  basically a large, narrow desk. You have one person on one side, the clerk, the emp loyee of the post office and you're on the other side doing what you are there to do – buying stamps or sending packages and so forth.

So, I walk up to the window and the clerk asks me “ What can I do for you?” This is just a nice way of saying, “How can I help you?”  I say “I need a book – no, make that a roll – of stamps.” The expression, “mak e that” means change what I just said. So, when I say “I need a book – no, make  that a roll – of stamps” I mean that I just made a mistake. I didn't mean to s ay a “book of stamps.” I meant to say, a “roll of stamps.” So, it's a way of corre cting yourself as you are speaking.

I say that, “I need a roll of stamps and I need to send this package priority to San Francisco.” “Priority” is one way of sending a pack age in the United States. It depends on how fast you want your letter or package  to arrive somewhere. There are many different ways of sending letters and pack ages. The faster it gets there, the more expensive it is. The most common way of se nding mail is what we call “first class mail.” There's nothing special about it. It'll get there, oh, depending on how far away the place you are sending it to, in a couple of days. If you sent something Priority, usually, that means it will arr ive in two to three days, even if it's on the other side of the country. For example,  if I send a package from Los Angeles to New York first class mail – regular mail , it may take up to a week to arrive. But, if I send it Priority Mail, it will ar rive in two to three days. The fastest way of sending mail is “Express.” “Express” usually  arrives the next day. I'm sending this package Priority to San Francisco.

The clerk then asked me, “You want insurance with t hat?” Notice the informal way he asks this question. The correct, grammatical  way would be, “Do you want insurance with that?” At least that would be the mo re formal way of phrasing the question. He instead says, “You want insurance with  that?” And by raising his voice at the end, you know he's asking a question. I say “Uh, I don't know. What do you recommend?” – meaning, “What do you suggest? ” He says, “Well, you can send it Priority with tracking if you want to s ee when it gets there.” “Tracking” (tracking) means that you are given a special numbe r and you can go online, you can go on to the Internet, and check to see when th at package arrived, when the post office employee, who delivers the package – we  would call that person the “postal carrier” – he will enter the day and time t hat he delivered the package and you will get that information on the Internet, if y ou want it. I say we call the person who delivers the mail the “postal carrier.” We used  to call it the “postman,” but people didn't like the word “man” because there wer e both men and women and so they've changed the term to “postal carrier” (ca rrier).

So, the clerk asked me if I want to send it Priorit y with tracking or if I want to send it insured. “To send a package insured” (insured) m eans that you buy a special kind of insurance policy. So, if something goes wro ng – if the post office loses the package – you will get money back for your package.  You only want to do that if

the contents of your package are valuable. “Content s” refers to what is inside of the package, what you are actually sending. It coul d be a bottle. It could be a shoe. It could be a computer. “Valuable” means that  it is worth a lot of money. “I decide that I'll take the insurance,” meaning I wil l buy the insurance.

The clerk then says, “Step aside to fill out the in surance form.” “To step aside” (aside) is a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to move  to one side of where you are standing right now, so that someone else can wa lk up and be helped. We would use this expression in a situation like this where you have a line of people waiting to be helped by a clerk or an employee of s ome organization. So, I stepped to one side. I move away from the window, i n order to fill out or complete the insurance form. The clerk says, after I finish filling out the insurance form, I should bring it back up to him. “To bring it back” means to return it to him. The clerk then waves me aside. “To wave (wave) someone aside” is another two- word phrasal verb. It means to move your arm, move your hand back and forth, to indicate to the person that you want them to ste p aside. It's not a very polite thing to do typically, but it is not uncommon.

I say that “I'm waved aside and then the clerk says , ‘Next in line!’” The clerk is asking for the next person to walk up to the window  in order to be served, in order to be helped. Then, I finish filling out the form and I wait patiently until the gentleman – the adult man being waited on in front of me – is finished. “To be waited” on means that someone is helping you. So, there is a person in front of me at the window who is being helped by the clerk. I'm waiting for this man to finish what he needs to do so that I can then be he lped when he finishes. I step back up to the window. That means I walk back up to  talk to the clerk. The clerk says, however, “Sorry,” meaning I'm sorry, “I'm on break now.” “To be on break” (break) means that you are not working anymore, tha t you are taking 15 or 20 minutes to relax. In most jobs, if you work more th an four hours, you get a break. You get to stop work in the middle and relax a litt le. That's what the clerk is going to do.

He says that the person next to him, at the next wi ndow, can help. I end the story by saying “Maybe it would be quicker” – maybe it wo uld be faster – “just to drive my package to San Francisco.” I'm saying that it's taking so long to mail my package, it would be quicker just to drive it from Los Angeles to San Francisco, which takes about six or seven hours. I’m making a joke, of course.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

For me, things never go very smoothly at the local post office. I've learned that if you want to mail a letter, you'll have no problems.  But if things get more complicated than that, well, watch out!

Yesterday I went there to mail a small package and pick up a book of stamps. I wait my turn in line, and when I get up to the wind ow, the clerk says, "What can I do for you?" "Well," I say, "I need a book – no mak e that a roll – of stamps. And I need to send this package priority to San Francisco ." "You want insurance with that?" he asks me. "Uh, I don't know, what do you r ecommend?" "Well," he says, "you can send it priority with tracking if you want  to see when it gets there, you can send it insured if the contents are valuable, o r you can do both."

"Okay, I'll take the insurance." "Then step aside to fill out the insurance form," he says, "and bring it back up to me when you're finis hed." With that, I was waved aside to fill out my form. "Next in line!" the cler k calls. When I finish filling out the form, I wait patiently until the gentleman being wa ited on in front of me is finished, and then step back up to the window. "Sor ry," the clerk says, "I'm on break now. She can help you at the next window."

Maybe it would be quicker just to drive my package to San Francisco.

# Problems at the Office

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 15 – Problems at the Office.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 15. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today's podcast is about problems at work. Lucy and  I are going to talk about a problem that Lucy had at work and how we thought sh e should solve the problem. Listen to our conversation and then I'll t alk about some of the expressions that we used. Let's get started

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: Hey Jeff, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Jeff: Sure, what's up?

Lucy: Well, I have a sticky situation at work and I  wanted to get your input. You're always so tactful.

Jeff: Thanks. I'm not sure I can help but I'll give  you my two cents.

Lucy: Well, it's like this. There's this guy I work  with who is always making jokes about the boss. Don't get me wrong. I like a good j oke now and then, especially about the boss. But, sometimes he goes too far.

Jeff. What do you mean?

Lucy: Well, just the other day, he got a picture of f the Internet and cut and pasted the boss's head onto it. Let's just say it w as a very unflattering picture of him.

Jeff: Hmm. That's really unprofessional, but it sou nds harmless enough, if he kept it to himself or just showed it to a few fr iends.

Lucy: That's just it. He didn't keep it to himself.  He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the entire company, including the top brass.

Jeff: You're joking, right?

 Lucy: No, I'm not. This is what I meant when I said  he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit.

Jeff: Is he a friend of yours?

Lucy: No, not really. But, I don't want the guy to get fired. He's actually a good person. He's just clueless, that's all.

Jeff: Well, that's a tough one. Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before he gets fired.

Lucy: Thanks. I appreciate it.

Jeff: Oh, it's no big deal. Let's go get a bite to eat.

Lucy: Sure. Sounds good to me.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Lucy saying to me, “Hey Je ff.” “Hey” is an informal way of saying “hi” or “hello.” She says, “Hey Jeff, can  I pick your brain for a minute?” “To pick (pick) someone's brain” means to get their  opinion, to get their advice, to ask them what they think. Lucy wants to pick my bra in for a minute, which means for short time, not necessarily just 60 seconds.

I say, “Sure,” meaning, “yes.” “What's up?” meaning  what is the problem? What is going on? Lucy says, “Well, I have a sticky situ ation at work.” When we say something is a “sticky (sticky) situation,” we mean  it's a difficult situation, a situation that is possibly embarrassing or difficul t for someone to talk about. We might also describe it as a sensitive situation. Lu cy wants to get my input on this problem. Your “input” (input) is your opinion of so mething, your advice about something. Lucy says that “I am always so tactful.”  “To be tactful” (tactful)” means to be polite, to always say the right thing, to never insult anyone – someone who's very good with words who doesn't ever  cause problems with other people, who never makes other people upset. W e could describe that person as being tactful.

Obviously, Lucy doesn't know me very well. I'm not very tactful at all. But, this is just a story, so, we’ll imagine that I am tactful. I say, “Thanks! I'm not sure I can help but I'll give you my two cents.” “To give some one their two cents” means to give them your opinion. It's the same, basically, a s “input.” It's an informal

expression. “Two cents” is not worth very much mone y, so the expression implies the idea that yes I will give you my opinion, but it might not be worth very much. It might not be very useful to you. You're being humbl e. You're saying. I don't really know very much but I will try to help you.

Lucy says, “Well, it's like this,” which is an info rmal way of saying here's the situation. Here's the description of the situation.  She says, “There's this guy I work with who’s always making jokes about the boss. ” The “boss” would be the leader, the head of their group or their company. S he says, “Don't get me wrong.” That expression “don't get me wrong,” is used when you want to say to someone “Don't misunderstand me.” “Don't get the wrong idea .” We use it when we’re going to say something that a person might interpre t incorrectly. When we say something to someone who may think, “Oh, that's a b ad thing,” or “You're saying something bad,” we use this expression “Don't get m e wrong.” So, “listen carefully and wait until I finish my explanation.” That's another way of describing the meaning of this expression.

Lucy says, “I like a good joke now and then.” “Now and then” means every once in a while, occasionally. She says she likes a good  joke especially about the boss. “But sometimes he goes too far.” “To go too f ar” means to do something that would normally be okay, but to do too much of it, to do it in such a way that it hurts other people or it bothers other people, that 's to go too far. This “guy” at work – and “guy” in the singular is always, or almo st always a man – goes too far in making jokes about the boss. He says things that  could make the boss or other people in the office angry or upset.

I ask, “What do you mean? And Lucy gives an example  of him going too far. She says, “Well, just the other day,” meaning just a fe w days ago or recently, “he got a picture off the Internet and cut and pasted the b oss’ head on to it.” So this guy at Lucy's work downloaded a picture from the Intern et and then using some sort of special software, perhaps Photoshop, he put the head of the boss – a picture of the head of the boss – on this photograph. We do n't know what the photograph was exactly, but we can guess that it wa s something funny.

Lucy says, “Let's just say it was a very unflatteri ng picture of him.” The expression “Let's just say” is used when you don't want to give the exact details. You don't want to go into a very detailed descripti on of something. You just want to give the person an idea what you're talking, abo ut a general idea of what you are talking about. That's when we would use this ex pression “Let's just say.” Not wanting to describe the picture in detail, Lucy say s “Let's just say it was a very unflattering picture of him.” “To flatter” (flatter ), as a verb, means to say something nice about someone.  “Unflattering” as an  adjective, would be

something that is not nice, something that doesn't complement that person, something that makes that person look bad.

Jeff says – that's me – “Hmm. That sounds really un professional.” Notice again the prefix “un.” “Un” means not. So, when I say tha t's really “unprofessional,” I mean that's not professional. That's not something you should do in a work environment. “But,” I say, “it sounds” – it appears  – “harmless enough.” “To be harmless” (harmless) means to not cause any problem s, to not be very serious, to not cause any injury or damage. I say that the p icture is harmless enough, meaning it's no big deal. “If,” I say, “he kept it to himself or showed it to a few friends.” So, it's harmless enough only if this guy  kept it to himself, meaning he didn't show anyone else or only showed it, only gav e it to, a few friends.

Lucy says, “That's just it.” That expression “that' s just it” means now you’ve identified the problem. You’ve said something that indicates the problem and now I'm going to tell you what that is. Lucy continues,  “He didn't keep it to himself. He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the  entire company, including the top brass.” So, this guy at Lucy's work sent the pi cture via email, using email, to everyone in the company, including the top brass. “ The top brass” are the bosses, the people who run the entire company. If it's a large company, you may have several different levels of bosses. The top br ass would be the most important ones – the president, the vice president and so forth.

I then say, “You're joking, right?” I am asking if Lucy is making a joke, if she's just kidding. She says, “No, I'm not. This is what I mea n when I said he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit” – when to stop, when not to go too far. Jeff says, “Is he a friend of yours?” Lucy says, “No, no t really, but I don't want the guy to get fired.” “To get fired” means to lose your jo b.

“He's actually a good person. He's just clueless. T hat's all.” “To be clueless” (clueless) means to not understand really what's go ing on, someone who is ignorant, someone who doesn't quite understand the implications of everything he says or does. That would be someone who is cluel ess. Notice also the suffix (less), which comes at the end of this word. It mea ns without. Before, we had the word “harmless,” meaning without harm. Here, we hav e “clueless,” meaning without a clue, without an idea.

I say, “Well, that's a tough one.” That's a difficu lt situation. “Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before  he gets fired.” “To cut something out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop, to no longer do it, especially when we're talking about something you s houldn't be doing anyway, something that's bad. Lucy says to me, “Thanks, I a ppreciate it.” I say “Oh, it's no

big deal.” It's not something that she needs to tha nk me for. “Let's go get a bite to eat,” I say. “To go get a bite (bite) to eat” means  to go and get some food, to go to lunch or to go to dinner. Lucy says, “Sure, soun ds good to me,” meaning yes, that's a good idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: Hey Jeff, can I pick your brain for a minute?

Jeff: Sure, what's up?

Lucy: Well, I have a sticky situation at work and I  wanted to get your input. You're always so tactful.

Jeff: Thanks. I'm not sure I can help but I'll give  you my two cents.

Lucy: Well, it's like this. There's this guy I work  with who is always making jokes about the boss. Don't get me wrong. I like a good j oke now and then, especially about the boss. But, sometimes he goes too far.

Jeff. What do you mean?

Lucy: Well, just the other day, he got a picture of f the Internet and cut and pasted the boss's head onto it. Let's just say it w as a very unflattering picture of him.

Jeff: Hmm. That's really unprofessional, but it sou nds harmless enough, if he kept it to himself or just showed it to a few fr iends.

Lucy: That's just it. He didn't keep it to himself.  He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the entire company, including the top brass.

Jeff: You're joking, right?

Lucy: No, I'm not. This is what I meant when I said  he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit.

Jeff: Is he a friend of yours?

Lucy: No, not really. But, I don't want the guy to get fired. He's actually a good

person. He's just clueless, that's all.

Jeff: Well, that's a tough one. Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before he gets fired.

Lucy: Thanks. I appreciate it.

Jeff: Oh, it's no big deal. Let's go get a bite to eat.

Lucy: Sure. Sounds good to me.

# Driving on the Freeways

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 16 – Driving on the Freeways.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 16. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today's topic is going to be driving on the freeway . Let’s get started.  > Driving in a big city like L.A. can be very difficu lt. It sometimes feels like I'm doing battle just to get to the grocery store. What is it  about getting behind the wheel that brings out people's aggressive side? The most mild-mannered driver becomes crazy when they get on the road.
> In L.A., people rely on the freeway to commute to their jobs or just to get around town. I think driving on the freeway has its good a nd its bad. On the one hand, there are no stoplights and the speed limit is over  55 miles per hour so you can get somewhere quickly.  On the other hand, there are drawbacks, too. People like to gun their engines and cut off other cars to  get ahead.  If you’re driving in the passing lane, for example, you’d better be driv ing very fast, since most people are speeding.  With all of these speeding ca rs, it’s not unusual to see a pileup every day of the week!
> As an alternate to the freeway, I sometimes take su rface streets. Of course, surface streets have their drawbacks, too. If you h ave a long commute to work or school, it can take you a long time to get there. T here are a lot of stop signs, stoplights, and crosswalks. And, people sometimes t ailgate if they think you're not going fast enough. Now that I think about it, there's sometimes even more congestion on surface streets than on the freeways!
> It’s tough living in L.A. unless you never leave yo ur house!

Our story begins when I say that, “Driving in a big  city like L.A.” – Los Angeles – “can be very difficult.” “It sometimes feels like I 'm doing battle.” “It sometimes feels like” – “it appears to me,” “it seems” – that  I'm doing battle. “To do battle” (battle) usually means to fight physically, or perh aps psychologically, with

another person. “To do battle” is a phrase we would  associate with the army, with a war, for example. But here, it just means I'm bat tling against other drivers – not physically, of course.

I say that “It sometimes feels like I'm doing battl e just to get to the grocery store” – the store where I buy my food. “What is it about getting behind the wheel that brings out people's aggressive side?” “To get behin d the wheel” (wheel) means to drive a car or a truck. You could say, “If you'r e going to drink alcohol, don't get behind the wheel,” meaning don't drive. The “wheel”  here refers to the “steering (steering) wheel” which is the round thing you turn  to move the car left and right.

I asked the question, “What is it about getting beh ind the wheel that brings out people's aggressive side?” “What is it about,” is a  common way of saying, “Why does this happen?” We use it when we're not really sure what the answer to the question is. We really don't know. “What is it abou t getting behind the wheel that brings out,” or that gets people to show, “their ag gressive side.” “To be aggressive” (aggressive) means, usually, to be very  forceful, to be very strong in a way that almost seems like you're trying to start  a fight. “To be aggressive” is to move with force, with determination, with strength.  The aggressive side of people comes out when they are driving on the freeway. “Th e most-mild mannered driver,” I say, “becomes crazy when they get on the  road.” A “driver” (driver) is a person who drives a car. “To be mild-mannered” mean s to me very calm – someone who's not likely to start a fight, someone who's very peaceful. I say that “The most mild mannered driver becomes crazy when they get on the road” – when they start driving. So, people who are normall y calm, when they get into the car and start to drive, they seem to go crazy.

“In L.A., people rely on,” or depend on, “the freew ay to commute to their jobs or just to get around town.” “To commute” (commute) me ans to travel from one place to another, usually between your home and whe re you work. We use the word “commute” when talking about going to and from  work. Some people commute in their cars. In some cities, people commu te on a subway. It depends on where you live. In L.A., people use the freeway to commute.

“I think driving on the freeway,” I say, “has its g ood and its bad.” “Its good and its bad” means its good side and its bad side. There are positive things and there are negative things about driving on the freeway. A  “freeway” is a road that doesn't have any stop signs or stoplights usually, where cars are driving much faster than on the other roads that are in a city.

I start with the good things. I say, “On the one ha nd.” That phrase “on the one hand” is used when you are going to give two sides to some story. You're going

to talk about two different things which may contra dict, or be opposite of each other. “On the one hand there are no stoplights.” “ Stoplights” are red, green, and yellow lights that tell you whether you can go and continue driving, or you must stop. “There are no stoplights on the freeway and the speed limit is over 55 miles per hour.” The “speed limit” is the maximum or high est speed that a car can drive on a certain road. In most American cities, the spe ed limit on the freeway is either 55 or 65 miles an hour. The speed limit on the streets in the city that are not freeways is usually much less – maybe 30, 35 mi les per hour.

“On the other hand,” I say – and I'm going to give the negative things about freeways – “there are drawbacks, too.” A “drawback”  (drawback) is a negative quality, a disadvantage of something, something tha t is not good that you don't want. The drawback of driving on the freeway, or at  least one of them, is that people like to gun their engines. “To gun (gun) you r engine (engine)” means to suddenly start driving very fast. Your engine is the same as your motor. It's the piece of machinery that makes your car go, causes y our car to move. “To gun your engine” means to suddenly go very fast in your  car.

Another disadvantage of driving on the freeway is t hat people cut you off. I say, “People cut off other cars to get ahead.” “To cut s omeone off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to move your car right in fron t of another car, usually so the other car has to slow down and you have to let that person come in front of you. I say that, “If you're driving in the passing lane, you'd better be driving very fast.” The “passing lane,” sometimes called the “fa st lane,” is the lane usually that's farthest to the left. A “lane” is just a par t of the freeway. Freeways in Los Angeles usually have two, three, sometimes four or even five lanes where cars are driving next to each other. If you want to “pas s” someone, that is, to go in front of someone and be traveling in front of them,  you should go to the first lane on the left – the lane that is farthest to the left . That's the passing lane or the fast lane.

On L.A. freeways, most people are “speeding.” “To s peed” (speed), as a verb, means to drive very fast, to be driving faster than  what you are supposed to be driving – faster than the speed limit. I say, “With  all of these speeding cars, it's not unusual” – it's not uncommon – “to see a pileup  every day of the week.” A “pileup” (pileup) is a car accident involving more than two cars, often three, four perhaps even 10 cars.

I say that, “As an alternate to the freeway, I some times take surface streets.” An “alternate” or an “alternate route,” would be a dif ferent way of doing something, a different choice, a different option. In this case,  the different option, instead of the freeway, would be to take or to drive on “surface s treets.” “Surface (surface)

streets” are roads that are not like a freeway – ro ads that have stop signs and places where you have to stop or that you have to d rive more slowly. I say that surface streets have their drawbacks too. “If you h ave a long commute to work or school, it can take you a long time to get there.” “There are lots of stop signs,” which are the red signs that have the word “stop” o n them, “stop lights,” which we've explained already, and “crosswalks.”  A “cros swalk” (crosswalk) – one word – is a place for people who are walking to cro ss a street, to go from one side of the street to another. And in most places, if there is someone in a crosswalk, you, as the driver, must stop.

“People sometimes tailgate,” I say, “if they think you're not going fast enough.” “To tailgate” (tailgate) means to drive right behin d another car, too close for safety. That is, you’re driving so close that you c ould easily cause an accident. People do this here in L.A. when they think someone  is driving too slowly, in order to get them to either drive more quickly or to move to one side so that the car behind them can go ahead.

I say, “Now that I think about it,” now that I thin k about the situation more seriously, “there’s sometimes even more congestion on surface streets than on the freeways.” “Congestion” (congestion) is when yo u have a large crowd of, in this case, cars – a large group of cars that makes you have to slow down – that causes you not to be able to move very quickly. “Co ngestion” on the freeway would be lots of cars having to drive slowly becaus e there are too many cars on the freeway.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time, at a normal speed.

[start of story]

Driving in a big city like L.A. can be very difficu lt. It sometimes feels like I'm doing battle just to get to the grocery store. What is it  about getting behind the wheel that brings out people's aggressive side? The most mild-mannered driver becomes crazy when they get on the road.

In L.A., people rely on the freeway to commute to their jobs or just to get around town. I think driving on the freeway has its good a nd its bad. On the one hand, there are no stoplights and the speed limit is over  55 miles per hour so you can get somewhere quickly.  On the other hand, there are drawbacks, too. People like to gun their engines and cut off other cars to  get ahead.  If you’re driving in the passing lane, for example, you’d better be driv ing very fast, since most people are speeding.  With all of these speeding ca rs, it’s not unusual to see a pileup every day of the week!

And, people sometimes t ailgate if they think you're not going fast enough. Now that I think about it, there's sometimes even more congestion on surface streets than on the freeways!

# Reading the Newspaper

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 17 – Reading the Newspaper.   This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 17. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful, Los Angeles, California.   Today, we're going to talk about reading the newspaper – one of my favorite daily activities. Let's get started.  > I fell into the habit of reading the newspaper every morning when I was a kid. Back then, there used to be two daily newspapers – a morning edition and an afternoon edition.   Nowadays, of course, most cities in the U.S. have just a morning paper. I'm not too picky about which newspaper I read, although when it comes to national newspapers, I prefer reading the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal over USA Today.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not a news junkie. I just like browsing the different sections, reading the headlines, and checking out the classifieds. I usually skip the sport section and the funnies, and only flip through the food and health sections, but I always read the front page and the editorial page. On the weekends, I'll skim the entertainment section for movie listings and reviews.   I'm sort of old fashioned in that I still like reading a real, paper newspaper. Sure, I also read some of my news online, but nothing beats lounging around on Sunday morning reading the big, thick paper. Don't worry, though: I always recycle my stack of newspapers.
  I started our story by saying that “I fell into the habit of reading the newspaper when I was a kid.” “To fall into a habit” means to start a habit, or to get a habit. A “habit” is something that you do frequently on a regular schedule, or often. “To fall into a habit” means to start doing something and continue to do that something over and over again in the future. I say that “I fell into the habit of reading the newspaper when I was a kid,” when I was a child. That's quite true. I # Seeing Old Friends

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 18 – Seeing Old Friends.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 18. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, Lucy is going to tell us about som e old friends that she saw recently. Let's get started.  > This has been a month for seeing old friends. I got  an email a couple of weeks ago from an old friend from college. She and her fa mily are visiting L.A. for a week. They plan to see family and to visit old frie nds. Since she moved away, I hadn't seen her in ages. I'm looking forward to mee ting her new kids and seeing her again.
> Another old friend called this week. She and I were  buddies when we were young. She plans to swing by L.A. on her way to San  Francisco. We've made plans to have lunch. She works in Washington D.C. a nd is normally very busy. I'm glad she could make time for us to get together .
> When we say good-bye to our friends, we always hope  to keep in touch. But, what with this and that, it's sometimes hard to do. With friends that I've fallen out of touch with, it's sometimes hard to meet agai n and pick up where we left off. We've both moved on to a different phase in our liv es. Some of my old friends have become very successful, and are living lives i n the fast lane. Other friends are having a more difficult time and are just makin g ends meet. But, no matter how they're doing, it's always nice to touch base a gain.
> I'm really looking forward to seeing these old pals  and catching up after all this time. We just won’t mention how much we’ve aged.

Lucy begins her story by saying that “this has been  a month for seeing old friends.” The word “old” here can mean two differen t things. It can mean friends who are advanced in age; someone who is 90 years ol d might be called your “old friend,” versus your “young friend.” Here, Lucy usi ng it in a different meaning, to

mean the opposite of “new.” An “old friend” would b e a friend whom you have known for many years or many decades, even.

Lucy says that she “got an email a couple of weeks ago” – a few weeks ago, two, maybe three weeks ago – “from an old friend from co llege” – someone she went to the university with. This friend and her family “are visiting L.A.” – Los Angeles – “for a week. They plan to see family and [to] vis it old friends.” “Since she moved away,” since she went to another place, “I ha dn't seen her in ages.” “In ages” means for a very long time, maybe 10 years or  20 years. “A long time” is an expression that is relative, and “ages” is also relative, depending on what other time period you're talking about. But here, it definitely has been a long time. She says, “I'm looking forward to meeting her new k ids and seeing her again.”

“Another [old] friend called this week,” she says. Lucy says, “She and I were buddies when we were young.” Your “buddy” (buddy) is your close friend. This is a term that we use informally. It's not quite as co mmon anymore. We would use it especially for younger children. A young boy might have a buddy. There's even something in schools called the “buddy system.” The  buddy system, which can be used not just in school but anywhere, is the ide a that you have someone who is helping you and you’re helping them, especially if you're going on a trip, for example.

Well, Lucy is talking about a buddy of hers – a goo d friend of hers when she was young. This friend “plans to swing by L.A. on her w ay to San Francisco.” “To swing (swing) by” somewhere means to stop at one lo cation on the way to another location, or to visit someone briefly on yo ur way to traveling somewhere else. “I have to go to the grocery store this after noon, but first I'm going to swing by the coffee shop and pick up a cup of coffee” – I 'm going to stop there briefly on my way to another place. That's the meaning of “ to swing by” somewhere. This friend is going to “swing by L.A. on her way to San Francisco.”

“Swing by” is usually used when we're talking about  a place that's relatively close. We don't usually use it in this context of t alking about going to a completely different city, but that's what Lucy tel ls us. She says, “We've made plans to have lunch. She works in Washington, D.C.”  – which is our nation's capital, on the East Coast of the United States – “ and is normally very busy.” Lucy says, “I'm glad she could make time for us to get together.” “To make time for” someone, or simply “to make time,” means to fi nd time to do something when you are busy – to plan on something for someone eve n though you have many other things to do.

Lucy says, “When we say good-bye to our friends, we  always hope to keep in touch.” “To keep in touch” means to stay in contact , to be continuing your communication with the person. This is something yo u may say to someone who's perhaps leaving for another city, going to wo rk in a different place: “Let's keep in touch.” Or you could just say it to someone  who perhaps you don't plan on seeing a lot of in the near future, but you want  that person to remain your friend. Lucy says, “But, what with this and that, it's sometimes hard to do.” This expression, “what with this or that,” means “with e verything else that is going on,” because life is so busy. That's the meaning of the expression “what with this and that.”

Lucy says, “With friends that I've fallen out of to uch with, it’s sometimes hard to meet again and pick up where we left off.” “To fall  out of touch” is the opposite of “to keep in touch.” When you fall out of touch with  someone, you no longer call them or email them or communicate with them very fr equently. Lucy says when you do that, it's “hard to meet again and pick up w here we left off.” “To pick up where you left off” means to go back to the point w here your, in this case, friendship ended and continue from that point. We can use this expression – “to pick up where you left off” – in a lot of different  ways. If you were reading a book, for example, you would want to continue reading the  book tomorrow at the place where you stopped reading it today. You would want to pick up where you left off. In this case, it means to continue a relationship a fter many years.

Lucy says, “We’ve both moved on to a different phas e in our lives.” “To move on” means to progress, to leave one place and go to ano ther. In this case, they’ve “moved on to a different phase” (phase). A “phase” is a period or a step along a certain progression. You are moving towards some go al, perhaps. You are changing your situation, or the situation is changi ng for you.

So, you might meet a beautiful woman and fall in lo ve with this woman. During the first few months, you are in a phase of your re lationship where everything is wonderful, and everything is fantastic, and you con tinue to see this woman, then eventually you get married. Now you move to a diffe rent phase where everything is terrible, and – no, I'm just kidding. Just a dif ferent phase, that's all.

We continue our story. Lucy says, “Some of my old f riends have become very successful, and are living lives in the fast lane.”  The “fast lane” (lane) means a very busy, often stressful lifestyle with lots of t hings happening. We often use this expression for someone who is perhaps very successf ul in business, who's making a lot of money and who does a lot of things.  They go different places. They see different people. They're very busy. Livin g life in the fast lane has the idea of something exciting – something exciting is happening in your life.

 Lucy says that other friends of hers “are having a more difficult time and are just making ends meet.” “To make ends meet” means to bar ely have enough money to pay for your expenses, to pay your bills. You ha ve just enough money to survive, but not any more.

Lucy says, “No matter how they're doing, it's alway s nice to touch base again.” “To touch base” (base) means to contact someone to find out what is happening – “to check in” with someone, we might say. Let's s ay you asked someone to build a new house for you. You have a lot of money,  and you ask this person to construct a new house. You would want to touch base  with that person frequently – many times – to find out what's going on, to get a progress report. “To touch base” means to communicate with someone, usually for some specific purpose. It's often used in businesses or formal settings.

Lucy ends by saying, “I'm really looking forward to  seeing these old pals and catching up after all this time.” A “pal” (pal) is a friend – an informal term for a close friend, like “buddy.” “To catch up” is a two- word phrasal verb which here means to learn about events of someone's life after  not having seen that person for a long time. You talk to a friend you haven't t alked to in 10 years. You want to find out what happened to that friend during those 10 years. You want to “catch up.”

Lucy ends by saying we just don't mention “how much  we've aged.” When you see this person after a long time, you don't talk a bout how you have become older. “To age” means to become older.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

This has been a month for seeing old friends. I got  an email a couple of weeks ago from an old friend from college. She and her fa mily are visiting L.A. for a week. They plan to see family and to visit old frie nds. Since she moved away, I hadn't seen her in ages. I'm looking forward to mee ting her new kids and seeing her again.

Another old friend called this week. She and I were  buddies when we were young. She plans to swing by L.A. on her way to San  Francisco. We've made plans to have lunch. She works in Washington D.C. a nd is normally very busy. I'm glad she could make time for us to get together .

When we say good-bye to our friends, we always hope  to keep in touch. But, what with this and that, it's sometimes hard to do. With friends that I've fallen out of touch with, it's sometimes hard to meet agai n and pick up where we left off. We've both moved on to a different phase in our liv es. Some of my old friends have become very successful, and are living lives i n the fast lane. Other friends are having a more difficult time and are just makin g ends meet. But, no matter how they're doing, it's always nice to touch base a gain.

I'm really looking forward to seeing these old pals  and catching up after all this time. We just won’t mention how much we’ve aged.

# Tough Negotiations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 19: Tough Negotiations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 19. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we’ll try to negotiate or arrange a good deal or bargain. It’s a story about my experiences renting an apartment her e in Los Angeles.  Let’s get started! > I'm not what you would call the world's best negoti ator, but sometimes it's necessary to engage in a tough negotiation. Take, f or instance, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment. This was back i n college, when I was renting a small studio in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. When my lease was up, the landlord and I sat down to hammer  out the terms of a new lease.
> "I'll tell you what I'm going to do," he said. "I'm  going to give you a break on rent if you sign a two-year lease instead of just a one-yea r lease."
> "Well," I said, "I don't know. What sort of break a re we talking about here?"
> "I'll give you a 5% rent increase instead of a 10% increase in exchange for you signing a two-year lease. It's a win-win situation:  you get a cut in rent, and I get the security of a two-year lease."
> At this point, I decided to make a counter-proposal . "How about this," I said, "You give me a one year lease with a six percent increas e."
> "No, I can't make that sort of deal," he said. "But  here's what I can do, and it's my final offer: I'll pay for your electricity for the first 6 months of the lease, along with the other terms I mentioned before."
> "You drive a hard bargain. Okay, it's a deal," I sa id. I guess I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more, but I was happy with o ur agreement. Now all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.
> Today we’re talking about negotiations. Negotiation s are when you have to try to reach an agreement on something with someone, eithe r in business or in your personal life.  Tough negotiations are difficult ne gotiations, negotiations that require a lot of effort or work.

I started by saying that “I’m not what you would ca ll the world’s best negotiator.” Someone who negotiates is called a “negotiator” (ne gotiator).The phrase, “I’m not what you would call,” means “No one thinks that  I am very good at this” or “I would not be called by someone else (this thing).” We often use it as a way to be humble, to not brag or boast about yourself. So, wh en I say “I’m not what you would call the world’s best negotiator,” I’m saying  I’m not very good at negotiating.

When you use this phrase about someone else, it is a criticism. If someone is a very bad singer, you could say, “He’s not what you would call the world’s best singer.” People say that about me all the time.

I said in the story that “sometime it’s necessary to engage” – to take part – “in a tough negotiation.”  Then I said, “Take, for instan ce, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment.” Take, for instance means si mply “For example” or “As an example.” “The time I had to” here means “When I  had to.”

I said I had to “renew the lease on my apartment. “ To renew some agreement or contract” means to extend it, to make it go longer.  So, when you have an agreement and you renew it, you’re committing to a longer period of time. You are promising to do what the contract says for a lo nger time.

I say that I’m trying to renew my lease. A “lease” (lease) is a rental agreement, a contract between two people where one person owns s omething and the other person pays to use it. A lease is a contract to ren t an apartment or some other building. You can also use the term “lease” for a c ar. If you’re leasing a car, you’re just paying rent on the car. You are using s omeone else’s car by paying them money.

For an apartment in the United States, typically yo u sign or agree to a one-year lease.  After one year, you can usually renew your lease.

I said that the tough negotiations that I was part of were back in college. We use that expression “back in” to mean “when I was” or “ at the time of.” For example,

you could say, “Back in the 1920s, people liked to dance to jazz music.” That means that in the 1920s, people enjoyed dancing to jazz music.

I said “I was renting a small studio in the Miracle  Mile area of Los Angeles.” A “studio” apartment is a one-room apartment. Everyth ing is in one room: your bedroom, your bed, your kitchen, your clothes. You just have one room. If you have a separate room for the bedroom, that would be  called a “one-bedroom” apartment. But this was just a studio apartment. the “Miracle Mile area” is just a part of Los Angeles, in the middle of the city of L os Angeles.

I said that my lease was up. When a lease is coming  to an end, we can use the expression “was up” or “is up.” We also use that wi th the word “time.” “Time is up” means there’s no more time or the time is over,  the time is finished. If you have students who are taking an exam and the teache r says, “Time is up!” she means, “Stop working on your exam, the time is over .”

In the story, my lease was up, so the landlord and I sat down to hammer out the terms of a new lease. A “landlord” (landlord) is so meone who owns a building and rents part of the building to someone else. is aid I was sitting down or meeting with my landlord “to hammer out the terms of a new lease.” “To hammer out something” or “to hammer something out” means to negotiate, to figure out, to come to a solution. “Terms” (terms) in a negotia tion are the specific points that you are negotiating about. So, for a lease on an ap artment, the terms would be how long the lease is, how much you pay for rent, w hether you pay for gas, electricity, and water, and so forth.

I then used a couple of expressions that are very c ommon in negotiations, whether it’s a personal or business negotiation. On e of them was, “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.” This is an expression that w e would use before we give someone our proposal, our ideas for an agreement we  are negotiating. The idea here is that we are going to give the person a good  deal, a bargain, perhaps a low price.

I said that the landlord told me he would give me a  break on rent. A “break” (break) here means a reduction, when you make somet hing less. The expression is “a break on  something.” “I’m going to give you a break on the price of a new car” means “I’m going to reduce or lower the price for you.” The landlord said he would give me a break on rent if I signed or agreed  to a two-year lease instead of just a one year lease.

I responded to the first proposal by my landlord by  saying, “What sort of break are we talking about here?” The expression, “What s ort of (something) are we

talking about?” means “What exactly are the details ?” For example, my friend wants to go on a trip, and he wants to go camping i n a tent out in the middle of the desert. So I say, “Well, what kind of tent are we talking about here?” meaning “Give me more information about it.” By the way, I would never go tenting or camping in the desert. In fact, I’d never go tentin g anywhere. I’m not a camper.

Anyway, back to – let’s return to – our story: I sa id that the landlord proposed only increasing my rent 5% instead of, or in place of 10% in exchange for signing a two-year lease. “In exchange for” is a common neg otiating term. It means: You give me something, I give you something. We exchang e or give each other something of value.

My landlord says this is a “win-win situation.” “Wi n-win” means “You win and  I win” – we both benefit or gain something from the n egotiation. The landlord said I would get a cut in rent. A “cut in rent” is the sam e as a “break on the rent,” a reduction in the rent.

Now, I wasn’t happy with the landlord’s first propo sal, so I made a counterproposal. A “counterproposal” means after so meone proposes or give his ideas, you reply with or give your own ideas. We ev en use that word “counter” as a verb: “He countered my proposal with another prop osal.” Instead of counterproposal you can also say “counteroffer.”

I introduced it by saying, “How about this?” and th en I gave him my idea. That expression “How about this?” is used before we are about to give someone our views or ideas about how the contract or the negoti ation should be. You can use this expression when you’re trying to come to an ag reement with someone about what to do about any situation. For example, you co uld say, “You want to go to the movies. I want to go to the beach. How about th is? We go to the movies first, and then the beach.” That is how we use “How about this?”

I said, “How about this?” and then gave my counterp roposal: “You give me a one-year lease with a six percent increase.” He res ponded by saying, “No, I can’t make that sort of deal.” A deal is an agreement.

He then said to me, “But here’s what I can do, and it’s my final offer.” There are two expressions here: “Here’s what I can do” and “f inal offer.” “Here’s what I can do” is what you would say in a negotiation when you  are not agreeing completely with the other person, but you’re willing to compro mise in the negotiation. To compromise means you give up something and the othe r person gives up something.

The other term my landlord used was final offer. Wh en someone says, “It’s my final offer,” they mean “That’s all I’m willing to do or to give.” The person is not going to compromise anymore.

My landlord’s final offer was that he would pay for  my electricity – my electrical bill – for the first six months of the lease, “alon g with,” or in addition to, the other terms he already mentioned.

I ended by saying to my landlord, “You drive a hard  bargain.” A “hard bargain” is a difficult bargain or difficult agreement. The exp ression “to drive a hard bargain” means that the other person is a very tough negotia tor, that the negotiations are very difficult. I then say, “It’s a deal,” meaning “I agree to your terms.” I accept your proposal.

I say that “I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more.” “To bargain someone down” means to get them to reduce their pri ce or to compromise more. I did not try to bargain my landlord down because I  was happy with or satisfied with the agreement.

After I agreed to my landlord’s terms, I said that “All I had to do was sign on the dotted line.”  “All I had to do” means “The only th ing I had to do.” The “dotted line” in a contract, is where you put your signature indi cating you agree to the contract. This is a common expression in English, “ to sign on the dotted line.” It means you are going to sign a contract agreeing to something.

Now let’s listen to our story this time at a normal  speed.

[start of story]

I'm not what you would call the world's best negoti ator, but sometimes it's necessary to engage in a tough negotiation. Take, f or instance, the time I had to renew the lease on my apartment. This was back i n college, when I was renting a small studio in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. When my lease was up, the landlord and I sat down to hammer  out the terms of a new lease.

"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," he said. "I'm  going to give you a break on rent if you sign a two-year lease instead of just a one-yea r lease."

"Well," I said, "I don't know. What sort of break a re we talking about here?"

"I'll give you a 5% rent increase instead of a 10% increase in exchange for you

signing a two-year lease. It's a win-win situation:  you get a cut in rent, and I get the security of a two-year lease."

At this point, I decided to make a counter-proposal . "How about this," I said, "You give me a one year lease with a six percent increas e."

"No, I can't make that sort of deal," he said. "But  here's what I can do, and it's my final offer: I'll pay for your electricity for the first 6 months of the lease, along with the other terms I mentioned before."

"You drive a hard bargain. Okay, it's a deal," I sa id. I guess I could have tried to bargain him down a bit more, but I was happy with o ur agreement. Now all I had to do was sign on the dotted line.

# Formal Emails

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 20 – Formal Emails.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 20. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we're going to listen to an email from a student to a professor that uses a little bit more formal language. Let’s get started.  > Dear Dr. Lee:
> I don't know if you'll remember me, but I introduce d myself to you after your keynote at last week's conference. As I mentio ned to you, I have read all of your work and I am a great admirer of your research . Your article in the top journal Language Learning  was groundbreaking.
> The reason I am contacting you is that I would like  to come to your university to study with you. I met some of your students at the conference and they couldn't stop singing your praises as a professor. I don't k now if you are accepting any new students for the next year, but if so, I hope y ou will consider me.
> I have included two attachments to this email. I am  sending a copy of my CV, and I am also including a research paper I complete d earlier this year. I hope that these will give you an idea of my qualifications an d experience. Please let me know if you need more information or more samples of my academic work.
> It was a pleasure and a privilege to meet you at the conference, and I hope to hear more about your research at a future conferenc e.
> Sincerely,
> Lucy Hocevar

Our email begins by the person writing it saying, “ Dear Doctor” – abbreviated (Dr.) – “Lee:”. A couple things about this first li ne of the email, what we would call

the “salutation” – it begins by using the word “dea r,” which is very common in writing letters and now emails, especially formal e mails or letters. “Doctor,” of course, is a title that a professor might have. It also would be used, of course, for a medical doctor.

“Lee” is her last name. In writing a salutation suc h as this, you wouldn't use the first and last name. Normally in English, when you' re writing a formal note or letter, you're going to just use the title of the p erson – “Mr.,” “Ms.,” or in this case “Dr.,” and then the last name of the person. So, if  this person's name was Judy Lee, you wouldn't say “Dear Doctor Judy Lee.” You w ould say instead, “Dear Doctor Lee.”

Finally, the colon “:” in the salutation is also an  indication that this is a formal email or, in the case of a letter, a formal letter.  If you use a comma “,” that's a little less formal. The first paragraph begins, “I don't know if you'll remember me.” This is a common phrase when you're writing a lette r to someone whom you've met, but you're not sure if the person will remembe r you. Perhaps it was many weeks ago or even months ago.

Lucy says here, “I don't know if you'll remember me , but I introduced myself” – I came up to you and told you my name – “after your k eynote at last week's conference.” Okay, so it's only been one week since  she has met this professor. Although, the professor may have met many people at  the conference, and so it's still a good idea to use this expression, “I don't know if you'll remember me.”

“Keynote” (keynote) refers to a speech at a large c onference or convention that is given to a large group of people. A “conference” is  an event where people who are interested in the same topic, the same ideas, m eet together and talk about those ideas. Almost every professional group has it s own conference where you go and you can learn more about your particular are a of interest, or your particular type of job, by talking with other peopl e who have those same jobs or those same interests. This was clearly an academic conference – a conference for university professors.

Lucy says, “As I mentioned to you” – as I said to y ou in our conversation – “I have read all of your work.” “Work” here means “all  the things you have written.” “And I am a great admirer of your research.” “To be  an admirer” (admirer) means to be a fan, someone who really appreciates and res pects someone. You can be an admirer in a professional sense. You could also be an admirer in a personal sense. We have the expression “a secret admirer.” T his would be someone who likes you in a romantic way but doesn't say who the y are. They may send you a

note but not sign the note, or send you a flower bu t not say where the flower is from. That would be a secret admirer.

Well, Lucy is not a secret admirer. She's an admire r of Dr. Lee's research. “Research” refers to scientific studies, in this ca se, that professors do so they have something to do with their time. As a former p rofessor, that's not too far from the truth, let me tell you. Anyway, Dr. Lee ha d an article in a “top journal.” That is what Lucy says in her formal email. A “top journal” would mean a very important journal or one of the best journals. A “j ournal” is a scientific magazine where scientific studies, articles, are published.

This was a study in a journal called Language Learn ing  that was, according to Lucy, “groundbreaking.” Something that is “groundbr eaking” – one word – is something that is new and important. New informatio n about a certain topic would be groundbreaking. We often use this when we are talking about information that may start people researching in a completely different direction or in a completely different area. Some of the earl iest studies in a particular scientific field are often called groundbreaking.

Lucy says the reason she is contacting Dr. Lee is t hat she would like to come to her university to study with her, to be her student . She says, “I met some of your students at the conference and they couldn't stop s inging your praises as a professor.” “To sing someone's praises” (praises) m eans to talk about someone's good qualities, to say how good someone is at what they do. Lucy is saying that she met some of Dr. Lee's students at the conferenc e and they were telling her about how wonderful a professor Dr. Lee was.

Lucy says, “I don't know if you are accepting any n ew students for the next year” – I don't know if you will allow new students to st udy with you next year. “But if so” – if you are – “I hope you will consider me.” “ To consider someone” means to think about choosing them for a position, or for a job, or for a task. “I am considering John as our next president.” I'm thinki ng about him and making him our next president. This verb, “to consider,” is us ed in this case in formal situations by people who are in authority, who have  the power to make decisions.

Lucy says, “I have included two attachments to this  email.” When you have an “attachment” (attachment) to an email, you have a d ocument or other file that you are sending with the email. You could be sending a photograph. You could be sending a Microsoft Word document. You could be sen ding a text file, a PDF file – all of these things would be called attachments.

She says, “I am sending (you) a copy of my CV.” “CV ” stands for curriculum vitae. It’s a document that describes your level of  education, your previous jobs, your accomplishments, your publications if this is an academic position, and so forth. “CV” is usually used to refer to what in mos t companies is simply called a “résumé” (resume). “CV,” however, is used for very high level positions or any position that involves being a professor or a teach er at the university.

Lucy says, “I am also including” – I’m also attachi ng, she could say – “a research paper I completed earlier this year. I hope that th ese will give you an idea of my qualifications and experience.” Your “qualification s” are the things that make you capable of or that show that you are able to do som ething. She says, “Please let me know if you need more information or more sample s of my academic work.” “Academic” here refers to university- or college-le vel work that is part of your – either schoolwork (your school assignments) or rese arch that you've done at the university.

Finally, she says, “It was a pleasure and a privile ge to meet you at the conference, and I hope to hear more about your rese arch at a future conference.” Lucy said it was a “privilege” to meet Dr. Lee. “Pr ivilege” (privilege) is the same as honor – a special benefit that is not given to e veryone. She is saying it was very nice to meet her. This expression, “It was a p leasure and a privilege,” is a very formal one that you would use in cases like th is, where you're talking about someone who is important or who you want to say is important.

Lucy ends her email by saying, “Sincerely” and then  a comma “,” – “Sincerely,” is followed on the next line by the name of the person  sending the email. If this were a letter, you would have a few spaces after the “Sincerely,” and you would sign your name. But we don't sign our emails, typic ally. So, you would just put your name. In this case, it's Lucy Hocevar. Hocevar  is her last name in this story.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Dear Dr. Lee:

I don't know if you'll remember me, but I introduce d myself to you after your keynote at last week's conference. As I mentio ned to you, I have read all of your work and I am a great admirer of your research . Your article in the top journal Language Learning  was groundbreaking.

The reason I am contacting you is that I would like  to come to your university to

study with you. I met some of your students at the conference and they couldn't stop singing your praises as a professor. I don't k now if you are accepting any new students for the next year, but if so, I hope y ou will consider me.

I have included two attachments to this email. I am  sending a copy of my CV, and I am also including a research paper I complete d earlier this year. I hope that these will give you an idea of my qualifications an d experience. Please let me know if you need more information or more samples of my academic work.

It was a pleasure and a privilege to meet you at the conference, and I hope to hear more about your research at a future conferenc e.

Sincerely,

# Getting an Interview

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 21 – Getting an Interview.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 21. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a story about getting a job intervi ew. Let's get started.  > I've finally landed my first interview. Well, actua lly, that's not really true. I have been on many interviews for part-time jobs. This wa s my first interview for a full- time job.
> In less than two months, I will graduate from Arizo na University. After a lot of back and forth trying to decide on a major, I final ly decided to double major. I would study both political science and marketing.
> These are not majors that usually go together. In f act, most people thought I was crazy. But, after a lot of soul searching, I decide d to combine my two main interests: 1. politics and 2. getting a job! Those are my two priorities. I thought that if I got degrees in these two fields, I could cast a wide net when going job hunting. And, that's what I'm trying to do now.
> Since I don't know if I want to work in the public or private sector, I've applied for jobs in both. In the public sector, I could work for the government. Maybe one day, I could even be a speech writer for the presid ent! Okay, maybe I should shoot a little lower.
> In the private sector, I could work for private org anizations such as museums or schools. Some of those are non-profit. I could also  work for a company. Everybody tells me that that's where you can make a  lot of money. I haven't decided yet. I'm planning to apply for a lot of job s and will see what happens. What I want now is just to get some job offers. The n, I can start to be picky.

On this episode, I'm talking about trying to get a job interview and use some vocabulary we might associate with job interviews a nd students getting their first

job. I begin by saying that, “I finally landed my f irst interview.” “To land (land) an interview” would mean to get an interview, to be ab le to participate in an interview. You could also say, “I've landed a job,”  that means I got a job – to acquire, to obtain – is another way of saying “to l and.”

“Well, actually,” I say, “that's not really true.” “It's not my first interview.” I say that “I've been on” – I have gone to – “many interviews for part-time jobs.” A “part- time job” is something you do less than 40 hours a week or less than what you would normally work in a typical work week. The oth er kind of job would be a “full-time” job. That would be a job where you work , at least in the United States, about 40 hours a week. In the story, then, this is my first interview for a full-time job. “In less than two months,” meaning less than t wo months from today, “I will graduate” – I will complete my studies – “I will gr aduate from Arizona University.”

“After a lot of back and forth trying to decide on a major, I finally decided to double major.” “Back and forth” means going from on e possibility, or one option, or one choice, to another. I can't decide. Should I  have the chicken or the beef? I go back and forth. Finally, I decide to get fish. W ell, here in the story, I'm going back and forth, trying to decide on, trying to make  a decision about, a “major.” Your “major” (major) is your specialization in coll ege. A “double major” is when you have two specializations in college. For exampl e, I was a double major in college. I majored in history and I also majored in  Spanish. In this story, I say that, “I double majored in political science and ma rketing.” Notice when we use “major,” as a verb, we use the preposition “in.” “I  majored in political science and marketing.” “Political science” is the study of gov ernment, of the people, and the organizations that have an influence on government.  “Marketing” is promoting and selling products and services to consumers, to people.

“These are not majors that usually go together,” I say. “To go together” means they are a match. They work together well. But thes e majors normally don't go together. You don't find them in the same person, i f you will. “In fact,” I say, “most people thought I was crazy.” They thought I was, we ll, basically, stupid. A lot of people think I'm stupid. That's probably true.

Well, anyway I say that “After a lot of soul search ing, I decided to combine my two main interests.” “Soul (soul) searching” would be thinking about a problem deeply, thinking about it for a long time, trying to decide what you really, really want, concerning some situation. “I decided to comb ine” – to put together – “my two main” – or my two principal interests – “politi cs and getting a job.” “Those,” I say, “are my two priorities.” Your “priority” is so mething that you think is very important, more important than other things. You co uld say “Make this a priority.”

That would mean make this something that you are go ing to do before anything else or before these other things that you might ha ve planned.

I then say, “I thought that if I got degrees in the se two fields, I could cast a wide net when going job hunting.” My idea was that if I got degrees, that is, a bachelors degree, in these two fields, in these two  areas of study, in this case, political science and marketing, “I could cast a wi de net.” That expression “to cast (cast) a wide net (net)” comes originally, I suppos e, from fishing. Sometimes, in order to catch fish, fishermen will throw a large n et, which is a piece of material with holes in it that you put into the water, and w hen you take it out of the water, you are able to get fish out of the water. The hole s allow the water to escape but not the fish. “To cast a wide net” then, is what we  would call a “metaphor.” The idea is that you are going to do a lot of different  things in order, hopefully, to find one thing that works. So, I'm going to cast a wide net. I'm going to apply to many different kinds of jobs hoping that one of them wil l be successful.“

Job hunting” is just another word for looking for, or searching for a job. I say that “Since I don't know if I want to work in the public  or private sector, I've applied for jobs in both.” The word “sector” (sector) refers to  a portion or a section of something. Here it refers to a part of the economy.  We can think of economic activity as being divided into the public sector, w hich is the government, and the private sector, which is everyone but the governmen t. “I'm not sure which sector I want to work in. So I've applied for jobs in both.”

“In the public sector,” I say, “I could work for the government. Maybe one day I could even be a speech writer for the president.” A  “speech writer” is someone who writes speeches which are talks, basically, tha t a president might give or some official might give to a group of people. “Oka y,” I say, “maybe I should shoot a little lower.” Becoming a speechwriter for the president would be very difficult. So, it's probably a good idea that I sho ot a little lower. “To shoot (shoot) a little lower” means to have goals that are not so  difficult to achieve, to have easier goals or easier objectives – things that don 't require that you climb to a very high level.

“In the private sector,” I say, “I could work for p rivate organizations, such as museums or schools.” “Some of those,” I say, “are n on-profit.” “Non (non) – profit (profit)” refers to organizations that don't try to  make money, that try to help other people. A charity, for example, that gives food to the poor would be a “nonprofit,” usually.

I say that “I could also work for a company. Everyb ody tells me that that's where you can make a lot of money.” I haven't decided yet . I say that “I'm planning to

apply for a lot of jobs and will see what happens. What I want now is just to get some job offers.” A “job offer” is when a company o r organization says, “Yes. We'd like to give you a job.” We will give you this  much money and this is what you will be doing. That's a “job offer.” I say “Fir st, I'm trying to get some job offers, then I can start being picky.” “To be picky ” (picky) means to be very selective. We might also use the word “choosy.” Som eone who is waiting for the very best option, who won't accept anything less th an what he wants, is sometimes described as being “picky.” We also can d escribe young children who don't like to eat certain kinds of food as being “p icky.” “Picky” comes from the verb “to pick,” which means to select or to choose.

Now to listen to the story this time at a normal sp eed.  > I've finally landed my first interview. Well, actua lly, that's not really true. I have been on many interviews for part-time jobs. This wa s my first interview for a full- time job.
> In less than two months, I will graduate from Arizo na University. After a lot of back and forth trying to decide on a major, I final ly decided to double major. I would study both political science and marketing.

But, after a lot of soul searching, I decide d to combine my two main interests: 1. politics and 2. getting a job! Those are my two priorities. I thought that if I got degrees in these two fields, I could cast a wide net when going job hunting. And, that's what I'm trying to do now.
> Since I don't know if I want to work in the public or private sector, I've applied for jobs in both. In the public sector, I could work for the government. Maybe one day, I could even be a speech writer for the presid ent! Okay, maybe I should shoot a little lower.
> In the private sector, I could work for private org anizations such as museums or schools. Some of those are non-profit. I could also  work for a company. Everybody tells me that that's where you can make a  lot of money. I haven't decided yet. I'm planning to apply for a lot of job s and will see what happens. What I want now is just to get some job offers. The n, I can start to be picky.

# Making a Good Impression

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 22 – Making a Good Impression.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 22. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode talks about how to act in a job interv iew. Let's get started. > My interview is today. It is with a large corporati on with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. It also has satellite office s across the U.S. and in Europe. I'm not sure if this will be the right fit for me, but I'm keeping an open mind.
> I got some sound advice from my aunt. She said I sh ould be confident but not cocky. That means I have to look for opportunities to talk about myself but not make the mistake of boasting or, worse, making thin gs up. I do that sometimes when I get really nervous. My brain stops working a nd my mouth keeps going.
> I need to be respectful but not meek. I want to be professional with everyone – my co-workers and my bosses – but I don't want them  to think that I would let my co-workers walk all over me.
> I should show them that I'm a team player. Nobody l ikes a person who tries to grab the limelight all of the time, especially if they're new, like me.
> Okay, I think I'm ready. I just have to remember to  be confident, calm, respectful, professional, and a team player. No problem, right?

We are going on an interview in this episode, or at  least we’re getting ready to go on an interview in order to make a good impression.  The expression “to make a good impression” means to show the other person how  good you are, how attractive you are – in this case, how right you are for this job. “To make a bad impression” is the opposite: to make the person thi nk that you're not a very good person.

I say that my interview is today with “a large corp oration” that has its “headquarters in San Francisco.” A “corporation” is  a large company, typically. “Headquarters” (headquarters) is the main location of the business, of a certain business. Some big corporations – some big companie s – have offices in many different cities, but there is one place that is the main office. We would call that the “headquarters.” It always has an “s” at the end , even though it is singular.

The headquarters is in San Francisco. This company also has “satellite offices.” The expression “satellite (satellite) office” refer s to a small office of a large company – not the headquarters, but other offices i n other cities.

“I'm not sure,” I say, “if this will be the right f it for me.” The expression “the right (right) fit (fit)” means the one that is best for m e. We might also use the word “suitable” (suitable). Something that is suitable is something that matches your qualifications and your interests. I say that I'm “ keeping an open mind.” That's a popular expression. “To keep an open mind” means yo u are willing to think about something new or different. You're not going to jus t say no to any new idea; you'll think about new possibilities.

I continued by saying that I “got some sound advice  from my aunt.” “Sound” (sound) is intelligent, reasonable, good. “Advice” refers to suggestions that other people have about how you should behave or what you  should do. “Sound advice,” then, would be good, reasonable suggestion s – in this case, about how to perform on the job interview. My “aunt” (aunt) is the sister of either my father or my mother.

I say that my aunt said that I should be “confident  but not cocky.” “To be confident” means to know that you can do something.  “To be cocky” (cocky), however, means to be arrogant – to know that you are going to do a good job but to behave as though you are better than other peopl e. “To be cocky” means to think that you are the best or you are better than most other people. It's not a positive thing. It's definitely not something that you want people to say about you, usually.

I say that I need to “look for opportunities” – loo k for or be aware of possibilities – “to talk about myself” during the interview, but I don't want to “make the mistake of boasting.” “To boast” (boast) means to brag (bra g), which means to tell other people about how good you are in order to make your self more important than everyone else. “Boasting” is something that a cocky  person would do.

“To make things up” means to lie, to say something that is not true. I say that I “don't want to make things up.” However, I also say  that “I do that sometimes,”

meaning I do make things up, or perhaps boast when I get really nervous. “My brain” – my mind – “stops working and my mouth keep s going.” In other words, I'm talking without really thinking carefully about  what I'm saying.

I then say that, according to my aunt, I need to be  “respectful but not meek.” “To be meek” (meek) means to be shy and weak – not to b e very strong. “Meekness” is something that some people try to be in order to  be humble, but if you are working in a business, in a corporation, it's not u sually a good thing to be meek. You want to be a little stronger in terms of your c haracter, especially in terms of dealing with other employees, other co-workers.

That's what I say in the story: I don't want to be meek, but I do want to be respectful. I want to be nice to other people and to give them the respect they deserve. I say I want to be “professional with ever yone – my co-workers and my bosses.” Your “co-workers” are the people who work with you, who are at the same level as you are – not your bosses, not your s upervisors.

I say that I don't want them to think “that I would  let my co-workers walk all over me.” The expression “to walk all over someone” mean s to take advantage of someone, to use someone who will allow you to do wh atever you want to do, but not in a good way. “To walk all over someone” is to  overpower them in a way, to not allow them to do what they want or say what the y want. You don't want someone to walk all over you in a job. You want to be strong enough to defend yourself, to defend your ideas.

I say that I should “show them” – I should demonstr ate to the people who are interviewing me – “that I'm a team player.” “To be a team player” means you work well with other people. You are able to get along w ith your co-workers.

I then say, “Nobody likes a person who tries to gra b the limelight all of the time.” The expression “to grab (grab) the limelight (limel ight)” means to be looking for attention, to want to be the focus of everyone's at tention, to want everyone to look at you or pay attention to you. I say nobody l ikes a person like that, “especially if that person is new” – new to the com pany, like I would be.

I end by saying that “I think I'm ready. I just hav e to remember to be confident, calm” – not nervous – “respectful, professional, an d a team player.” And then, somewhat jokingly, at the end I say, “No problem, r ight?” meaning those are actually very difficult things to do all at the sam e time. If you've ever had a very bad job interview, you know how difficult it is som etimes to be confident and calm.

I had a really bad job interview once or twice when  I was interviewing for a position to be a teacher. I got very nervous. I don 't even remember what I said, but I didn't get the job. We only hope that the per son in the interview in this episode has better luck.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.  > My interview is today. It is with a large corporati on with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. It also has satellite office s across the U.S. and in Europe. I'm not sure if this will be the right fit for me, but I'm keeping an open mind.
> I got some sound advice from my aunt. She said I sh ould be confident but not cocky. That means I have to look for opportunities to talk about myself but not make the mistake of boasting or, worse, making thin gs up. I do that sometimes when I get really nervous. My brain stops working a nd my mouth keeps going.
> I need to be respectful but not meek. I want to be professional with everyone – my co-workers and my bosses – but I don't want them  to think that I would let my co-workers walk all over me.

> Okay, I think I'm ready. I just have to remember to  be confident, calm, respectful, professional, and a team player. No problem, right?

Our scriptwriter never tries to grab the limelight,  but we want to give her a little of the limelight right now. Thank you, Dr. Lucy Tse.

# A Visit to the Doctor

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 23 – A Visit to the Doctor.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 23. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss going to the doctor. Let's get started.  > Going to the doctor is never particularly pleasant for me. But I couldn’t put it off any longer. It was time for my annual physical, and  there was no getting around it. So I picked up the phone and called for an appo intment. “I’d like to see Dr. Shimoya next week, please, if that’s possible,” is aid. Of course, it wasn’t possible. The doctor was booked until next month, the receptionist told me. “Okay,” I said, “Let’s schedule it for next month.”
> When the day arrived, I drove over to the doctor an d checked in at the receptionist’s desk. I had to present my HMO card a nd pay the co-pay of $15.00. The receptionist instructed me to go to waiting roo m B, down the hall, first door on the right. So I went there and took a seat to wa it. And I waited, and waited. Finally, my name was called and I went in to see the doctor. The nurse weighed me, took my temperature and blood pressure, and ask ed me why I was there. I told her it was time for my yearly checkup. She tol d me to follow her to the examination room and then to strip down to my under wear.
> Now I was sitting on the exam table, half-freezing,  waiting for the doctor to show up. Finally, he walked in, looked at my chart, and began his examination. “Breathe,” he said, as he placed the stethoscope on  my chest. “Breathe in and out slowly,” he said. I did so. Then he checked my throat and had me lie down to check my abdomen. Finally, he ordered a blood test and said, “Well, you’re good for another year, Mr. McQuillan.”
> Thank goodness, I thought to myself, and got dresse d to leave.

Today we are talking about going to the doctor. I b egan by saying, “Going to the doctor is never particularly pleasant for me.” When  we say something is

“particularly pleasant,” or “particularly” plus som e other adjective, we mean “especially” or “very.” “This cookie is not particu larly good” means this cookie isn’t especially good or it isn't very good, and “not par ticularly pleasant” means not especially pleasant or not very pleasant.

“Going to see the doctor is never particularly plea sant for me. But,” I said, “I couldn't put it off any longer.” The word “it” in t his sentence refers to going to the doctor, and “to put something off” means to delay it, to wait before doing it. For example, “I put off doing my homework until the nig ht before it was due” means I didn't do my homework right away. I delayed or wait ed until I had to do it.

In the story, I was trying to put off going to the doctor, but “I couldn’t put it off any longer” because “it was time for my annual physical .” An “annual physical” is when you go to the doctor not because you are sick,  but to make sure that you are healthy. “Annual” (annual) is an adjective mean ing once a year, and “physical” (physical) here refers to a general exam ination by a doctor.

In some American schools, children are required to have a physical every year. Many adults also go to the doctor once a year to ge t checked. We call this an “annual physical” or a “checkup” (checkup). Similar ly, when you go to a dentist to have your teeth checked every six months or every y ear, you can say, “I’m going in for a checkup,” meaning I'm going to see the den tist even though there may be nothing wrong with me, but I want to get checked an yway.

I said there was “no getting around it.” The word “ it” again refers to going to the doctor. The expression “to get around” something is  a phrasal verb. It means to avoid something, to find a way so that you don't ha ve to do something. But if you can't avoid it, then “there's no getting around it. ” “There’s no getting around talking to my neighbor.” It is not possible to avoi d that situation. After all, he is my neighbor. He lives next to my house.

When I called for the appointment, I said to the do ctor’s receptionist – the person who answers the phone – “I’d like to see Dr. Shimoy a.” “I’d like to see” here means “I’d like to make an appointment to see” or “ I would like to schedule an appointment to see.” The doctor, unfortunately, “wa s booked until next month.” “To be booked” (booked) means to already have somet hing else scheduled for a given date or time.

If someone asks you, “Can you go to dinner with me tonight?” but you already have made plans to have dinner with someone else, y ou could say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I’m booked tonight.” You can also say that i f you just don't like this person and don't want to have dinner with them, but I don' t recommend lying, of course.

We normally use this expression when talking about meeting with professionals such as doctors, dentists, professors, and so forth  – anyone you might need to make an appointment to see.

I said that I went to the doctor on the day of my a ppointment and I “checked in at the receptionist’s desk.” “To check (check) in” at a doctor’s office means to go to the front desk and tell the receptionist who you are so that they know you are there for your appointment. You can also check in a t a hotel. You can check in at an airport. This is when you give the person workin g for the airline – the ticket agent – your ticket, and they give you something ca lled a “boarding pass,” which is a piece of paper that you need to get on the air plane. Well, you also check in at the doctor’s and dentist’s office when you arriv e for your appointment. You tell them that you are here so they know that you are re ady to see the doctor, even though the doctor won't be ready to see you.

I said I had to “present my HMO card.” “To present”  here means to give. “HMO” stands for “health maintenance organization.” An HM O is basically a private company that offers medical insurance to people. Yo u buy insurance from the company, and then you can go and see one of the doc tors that use that same insurance company or get paid by that same insuranc e company.

I also had to pay “the co-pay of $15.00.” In the Un ited States it's very common, when you have health insurance with an HMO, to have  to pay something extra every time you go to the doctor. You don't have to pay a lot of money. You don't have to pay what we might refer to as the “full pri ce.” The insurance company pays for most of it, but you often have to pay a sm all amount, and we call that small amount a “co-pay” (co-pay). The co-pay might be $15. It might be $20. It might be as much as $50, depending on your health i nsurance.

After I checked in and paid my co-pay, “the recepti onist instructed me” – or told me – “to go to waiting room B.” A “waiting (waiting ) room” in a doctor’s or dentist’s office or a hospital or any sort of medic al facility is the place where you sit down and wait until they call your name. They c all your name when the doctor is ready to see you. They say your name, and then it is time for you to go in for your appointment. So, I went to the waiting room wi th the letter “B.” This is just a common way of naming waiting rooms. There may be a waiting room A, a waiting room B, a waiting room C, and so forth.

The waiting room was located “down the hall, first door on the right.” The word “hall” (hall) is short for “hallway” (hallway), whi ch is a long space between rooms where you walk in a building. To say something is “ down the hall” means it is

located nearby in the hallway, probably just a shor t distance. It's similar to the expression “down the street,” which means nearby or  close by on that street.

The phrase “the first door on the right” is a commo n way of giving directions to people. “The first door on the right” means the fir st door that you walk by on your right-hand side. The second door on the left would be the second door on your left-hand side, and so forth. After I waited for a very long time, my name was called – meaning someone said my name – and I went in to see the doctor. When I got into the doctor's office, the nurse “wei ghed” me. “To weigh (weigh) someone” means to find out how heavy they are or, i n my case, how fat I am.

The nurse also took my temperature. “To take someon e's temperature” (temperature) means to measure a person's body heat  with something called a “thermometer” (thermometer). A ‘thermometer” can ei ther be a little stick that goes in your mouth or a small device that goes in y our ear. There’s actually one other place they can put a thermometer, but we won' t talk about that now.

The nurse also checked my blood pressure. Your “blo od (blood) pressure (pressure)” has to do with how the blood is moving through your body. Usually, they check your blood pressure by wrapping a band a round your upper arm and then pumping air into the band to measure your bloo d pressure. You want to have low blood pressure, not high blood pressure. I f you have high blood pressure, then you could have problems with your he art or other things, but go see your doctor about this. I'm not a medical docto r.

I told the nurse I was there for my “yearly checkup .” “Yearly” (yearly) means the same as annually, or once a year. You can also say “monthly,” meaning every month, or “weekly,” meaning every week, or “daily,”  meaning, of course, every day. The nurse told me to “follow her to the examin ation room.” The “examination (examination) room,” or “exam room” for short, is the room in a hospital or doctor's office where the doctor sees you or examin es you.

The nurse told me to “strip down to my underwear.” “To strip (strip) down (down)” means to take off your clothing. And your “underwea r” (underwear) is what you wear underneath your outer clothes, underneath your  shirt and pants. So, “to strip down to your underwear” means to take off all  your clothing except for your underwear. I was sitting on the “exam table” – shor t for “examination table” – which is like a little bed that you lie on or sit o n when the doctor is examining you, or looking at you. I waited for the doctor to show up. “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to arrive – usually to arri ve for an appointment or something that has been scheduled at an earlier dat e.

The doctor looked at my chart. Your “chart” (chart)  – or your “file” – in a hospital or in a doctor's office means your medical records.  They keep your records in a file, and this file is called a “chart.” When a doc tor writes in your chart, it means he writes something in your file describing whateve r it is that you are there for. Of course, nowadays, most of this is done on computers . The doctor placed a “stethoscope” on my chest. A “stethoscope” (stethos cope) is an instrument that doctors use to listen to your heart and to your bre athing. One side of the stethoscope goes in the doctor's ears, and the othe r side has a little round disk that is placed against your chest to listen to your  heart and lungs.

The doctor also checked my abdomen. The “abdomen” ( abdomen) is the medical term for the area above your hips, above your waist , and below your chest. The area that includes your stomach is part of your abd omen. The doctor then ordered a “blood test.” A “blood (blood) test” is j ust what it sounds like. It is a test of your blood. You go to a laboratory and they stic k or put a sharp instrument called a “needle” in your arm, and then they draw y our blood, meaning they take a little bit of blood out of your body. Then they a nalyze or test the blood. The expression we use when a doctor wants this test per formed is “to order a blood test.”

The doctor then told me I was “good for another yea r,” which meant I was all done and I didn't have to come back until the next year. I thought to myself, “Thank goodness,” meaning “I'm glad about that.”

Now let's listen to the story again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of story]

Going to the doctor is never particularly pleasant for me. But I couldn’t put it off any longer. It was time for my annual physical, and  there was no getting around it. So I picked up the phone and called for an appo intment. “I’d like to see Dr. Shimoya next week, please, if that’s possible,” is aid. Of course, it wasn’t possible. The doctor was booked until next month, the receptionist told me. “Okay,” I said, “Let’s schedule it for next month.”

When the day arrived, I drove over to the doctor an d checked in at the receptionist’s desk. I had to present my HMO card a nd pay the co-pay of $15.00. The receptionist instructed me to go to waiting roo m B, down the hall, first door on the right. So I went there and took a seat to wa it. And I waited, and waited. Finally, my name was called and I went in to see the doctor. The nurse weighed me, took my temperature and blood pressure, and ask ed me why I was there. I

told her it was time for my yearly checkup. She tol d me to follow her to the examination room and then to strip down to my under wear.

Now I was sitting on the exam table, half-freezing,  waiting for the doctor to show up. Finally, he walked in, looked at my chart, and began his examination. “Breathe,” he said, as he placed the stethoscope on  my chest. “Breathe in and out slowly,” he said. I did so. Then he checked my throat and had me lie down to check my abdomen. Finally, he ordered a blood test and said, “Well, you’re good for another year, Mr. McQuillan.”

Thank goodness, I thought to myself, and got dresse d to leave.

# Taking Credit

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 24 – Taking Credit.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 24. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we are going to discuss problems a t the office. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: You're not going to believe what happened.

Lucy: Oh, is the big meeting over? What happened?

Jeff: Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the  new campaign.

Lucy: You're kidding me! I thought he might try to pull something like this, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve to do that.

Jeff: Yeah, and to top it off, he said that he did it all by himself.

Lucy: He's unbelievable. What a jerk! He slacks off  for the last two weeks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.

Jeff: Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'm  going to talk to the senior vice president. I think she'll listen.

Lucy: Are you sure? I think she's fair-minded, but maybe she thinks we should work it out with Dan ourselves. She might no t want to step in.

Jeff: Well, can you think of another way to handle this?

Lucy: I wish I could. I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout. Maybe the senior VP will end up thinki ng we can't fight our own battles.

Jeff: Yeah, you're right. I'm just so ticked off ri ght now I can't think.

Lucy: That's probably the problem. We both need to cool off so we can think straight. Let's get some coffee and see what we can  come up with.

 Jeff: That sounds good. But if I see Dan on the way  out, I'm going to floor that guy.

Lucy: Yeah. That makes two of us.

[end of dialogue]

In this episode, Lucy and I talked about problems a t the office after one of our coworkers – someone with whom we work – took credit  for one of our ideas. “To take credit for an idea” means to say that it was y ou who came up with or thought of an idea, when really it was someone else's idea.  We began by talking about how one of our coworkers, Dan, tried to take credit  in a meeting for our idea for a new campaign.

In business, a “campaign” (campaign) is a plan for marketing or advertising a new product or service, a new thing that you are se lling. You are going to put ads in the newspaper and on television and on the Inter net, but you first must develop a campaign. We also use the term “campaign”  when talking about politics. A politician who is running for office – that is, trying to get elected, trying to get people to vote for him or for her – runs a p olitical campaign. So, “campaign” refers both to advertising a product or service and to advertising a candidate who wants to be elected to the government . Maybe there's some connection between the two. I don't know.

I told Lucy that “Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the new campaign,” and Lucy says, “I thought he might try to pull somethin g like this.” “To pull something” here means to do something dishonest – to do someth ing that is not right or that violates or breaks some rule. It's an informal expr ession that we would use probably among our family and friends. We use it wh en talking about people who are doing something wrong, usually for selfish reas ons, for their own advantage – in order to get something for themselves. “I though the might try to pull something like this,” Lucy said.

Lucy says she didn't think he'd have the nerve to d o it. “To have the nerve” (nerve) means to have the courage or to have the st rength to do something. It's usually used in a negative way. When someone “has the nerve” to do something, it often means that they are being very bold about doing something wrong. They are not afraid to do something wrong. For example, if you are standing in line and someone decides not to wait, but to walk right up to the front of the line – which

we call “to cut in line” – you could say, “He had the nerve to cut to the front of the line.”

We also have a more informal expression, “to have the guts” (guts), which is very similar to saying “to have the nerve.” Although “to  have the guts” or “to have guts” can also be a positive thing. It can show that you are strong, that you have courage. I then tell Lucy, “Yeah, and to top it off , he said that he did it all by himself.” “To top it off” means there is even more to a story than what you already know or what you have already been told.

So, for example, I order a pizza to be delivered to  my house, and the pizza delivery person – the person who brings the pizza –  arrives one hour late. And you say, “Oh, I can't believe he was so late.” And I say, “Yes, and to top it off, it was the wrong pizza.” So, in this case we are using  the expression “to top it off” to describe something bad that gets even worse. Dan , in our story, tried to take credit for our idea. And to top it off, he said tha the did it all by himself.

Lucy calls Dan a “jerk” (jerk). “What a jerk,” she says. This is a very negative term, an insulting term. It's not a vulgar term. It 's not what we would call a “dirty word,” but it is an insult. A “jerk” is someone who  harms you, who does something wrong to you. There are a lot of expressi ons for that in every language, I'm sure. It's a negative term to describ e someone who hurts you in some way. “What a jerk.” But because it's not a for mal term, you wouldn't want to use it in a formal business setting unless you were  talking to friends, as is the case here in our story with Lucy and me.

Lucy says that Dan “slacks off for the last two wee ks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.” “To slack (slack)  off (off)” is a two-word phrasal verb that means not to work as hard as you should. “I'm feeling kind of lazy, so I think I'm going to slack off this week” means I'm n ot going to work very hard this week. That's what my boss says about me every week.  A person who “slacks off” is called a “slacker” (slacker). “Don't be a slacke r” means don't be lazy. Do your work.

Dan “doesn't lift a finger.” Someone who “doesn't l ift a finger” is someone who is lazy, who doesn't help at all. For example, I was s tanding in line at the bank and a woman dropped her check. The person in front of h er, however, didn't lift a finger to help her pick it up. He didn't do anythin g, in other words, to help her.

In the story I say, “Dan is not going to get away w ith it.” “To get away with” something means to do something wrong, to break a r ule or to break a law, without anything bad happening to you. You could sa y, “I got away with cheating

on my exam.” Not me, of course. Or you could say, “ I got away with not doing my homework.” You didn't do your homework and you were  not punished for it. You got away with it. Lucy describes our boss as “fair- minded.” “To be fair-minded” (fair-minded)” is to be honest, to be fair, to list en to both sides of an argument.

Lucy says our boss might think “we should work it o ut with Dan ourselves.” “To work it out” means to resolve a dispute or to solve  a problem. Our boss “might not want to step in.” “To step in” means to enter i nto an argument or a discussion. So, if there are two people fighting wi th each other and you “step in,” it means you get involved in the fight or the argum ent or the discussion, often to resolve the issue or to solve the problem. For exam ple, a parent has two children who are fighting. So, she “steps in” and stops them  from fighting.

I asked Lucy, “Can you think of another way to hand le this?” “To handle” (handle) something is a very common expression in English. “ To handle” means to take care of some problem or to resolve some issue. Lucy  says, “I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout.” “To blow something off” – and it requires both words, “blow” and “off” – means to ig nore it, not to pay attention to it, not to do it. “Are you going to hand in your pr oject today?” You say, “No, I'm feeling lazy. I'm going to blow it off.”

This phrasal verb can also be used in a situation –  when you are going to take time off. “Let's blow off work and go to the beach, ” for example. You could also blow off an appointment. “I was supposed to go to the doctor today, but I decided to blow it off,” meaning I decided not to go. Lucy says, “We have to think of the fallout.” When we have a problem that is going to a ffect or influence other people, we sometimes use the expression “the fallout.” “Fal lout” (fallout) literally means the radioactive particles after a nuclear explosion  – the radiation that makes people sick and can kill them. That's technically w hat “fallout” is.

But usually when we talk about the “fallout” from a  situation, we mean the results or the consequences of some event. For example, aft er Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans several years ago, part of the fallout was that many people criticized our government for not doing more. That would be considered part of the fallout – the results or the consequences of the main event.

Lucy worries that our bosses will think “we can't f ight our own battles.” A “battle” (battle) is a large fight, usually between two armi es. We use the phrase, however, “to fight your own battle” to mean to take  care of your own problems – on your own, without asking for anyone else's help.  I say, “I'm just so ticked off.” “To be ticked (ticked) off (off)” is an informal ex pression that means to be angry. “I'm really ticked off” means I'm really angry. I'm  really mad at somebody.

Sometimes we just say “I'm ticked” without saying the word “off.” “I'm ticked” means the same as “I'm ticked off.” You could also say, “Don't tick her off,” meaning don't make her mad, referring to your wife.

Lucy says, “We both need to cool off so we can thin k straight.” “To cool off” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to calm down, to s top being so angry. “To think straight” means to think clearly, to think lo gically. When you can't think straight, it usually means you are tired or angry o r confused. I then say, “If I see Dan on the way out,” meaning if I see him as I am l eaving the office, “I'm going to floor that guy.” “To floor” (floor) someone means to hit someone so hard that he falls onto the floor. Of course, I am not, in real life, a violent person. So, I wouldn't actually floor Dan. But that's what it literally me ans.

We also use the expression “to floor” when we’re ve ry surprised by something. “He told me the news and it floored me” means that the news was so shocking, it made me fall down on the ground. Not literally, but  the idea is that it was very shocking. But here when I say I want to floor Dan, I mean I actually want to hit Dan. Lucy says, “That makes two of us.” When two pe ople agree on something or when two people do the same thing, we sometimes say, “That makes two of us.” For example, if I say “I'm feeling really tire d,” and my friend says, “Yeah, that makes two of us,” that means “I feel tired too. I f eel the same way you do.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: You're not going to believe what happened.

Lucy: Oh, is the big meeting over? What happened?

Jeff: Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the  new campaign.

Lucy: You're kidding me! I thought he might try to pull something like this, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve to do that.

Jeff: Yeah, and to top it off, he said that he did it all by himself.

Lucy: He's unbelievable. What a jerk! He slacks off  for the last two weeks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.

Jeff: Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'm  going to talk to the senior vice president. I think she'll listen.

 Lucy: Are you sure? I think she's fair-minded, but maybe she thinks we should work it out with Dan ourselves. She might no t want to step in.

Jeff: Well, can you think of another way to handle this?

Lucy: I wish I could. I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fallout. Maybe the senior VP will end up thinki ng we can't fight our own battles.

Jeff: Yeah, you're right. I'm just so ticked off ri ght now I can't think.

Lucy: That's probably the problem. We both need to cool off so we can think straight. Let's get some coffee and see what we can  come up with.

Jeff: That sounds good. But if I see Dan on the way  out, I'm going to floor that guy.

Lucy: Yeah. That makes two of us.

# A Trip to New York City

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 25 – A Trip to New York City.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 25. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we’re going to discuss taking a tr ip to New York City. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

(The phone rings.)

Lucy: Hello.

Jeff: Hey, Lucy, it's Jeff.

Lucy: Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?

Jeff: Oh, it was great. The seven days in New York were a blast.

Lucy: Oh, yeah? Did you do any sightseeing or just visit with friends?

Jeff: I got to do both, actually. First, I saw my f riend Edmundo, who just moved there. He hadn't seen much of the city himself, so we went to all the tourist spots. We got a guidebook and went to the major museums, s aw a play, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Isla nd Ferry. We did all of that in a day and a half. It was a whirlwind, but we got to s ee a lot.

Lucy: A day and a half?! You guys must have been ex hausted.

Jeff: Yeah, we were. But, the rest of my trip was p retty low-key. My friends Pat and Billie rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate New York to visit some other friends of ours.

Lucy: Did you have to stay over in a hotel along the way, or did you drive straight through?

Jeff: We didn't bother with booking hotel rooms, so  we just drove straight there. It wasn't that far.

Lucy: How long did you stay there?

Jeff: We were only there two days, and we drove bac k and got back last night. My flight was this morning at 8:00 a.m. The worst p art of the whole trip was that my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto anothe r flight that had a three- hour layover in Chicago. That was a major pain.

Lucy: It sounds like it. Well, I'm glad you made it  back okay. And you even have the weekend to rest up before work on Monday.

Jeff: Yeah, I'll need it. I've got to catch up on m y sleep!

[end of dialogue]

We just listened to a telephone conversation betwee n Lucy and me about my trip to New York City. Lucy answered the phone by saying  “Hello,” which is the standard way to answer a phone in English: “Hello.”  And I said, “Hey Lucy, it's Jeff.” The expression “Hey” (hey) here means the sa me as “Hello.” A lot of people now, particularly young people, will say “He y” instead of saying “Hello,” although not when first answering the phone. You wo uldn't answer the phone by saying “Hey.” You would still say “Hello,” but the other person could then say, “Hey, Bob” or “Hey, Julie” instead of “Hello, Bob” or “Hello, Julie,” which might nowadays sound a little bit formal.

I said that my trip to New York City had been “a bl ast.” A “blast” (blast) here means a lot of fun. It is sort of an informal expre ssion that we use to describe a party or a trip or an event that was a lot of fun. After I tell Lucy that my trip was a blast, she says, “Oh yeah?” This expression, “Oh, y eah?” is very common in an informal conversation. It shows the other person th at you’re listening. “Oh, yeah?” means the same as “Really?” For example, som eone says to you, “The price of gasoline is now $4 a gallon.” You might re ply, “Oh, yeah?” meaning “Really?” It's very common to hear this phrase in c onversation.

I told Lucy that I visited my friend Edmundo and th at “we went to all the tourist spots.” A “tourist (tourist) spot (spot)” is a place where tourists like to go. The terms “spots” here just means places. I also said w e had a “guidebook.” A “guidebook” (guidebook) is a book that tells you wh ere the hotels and restaurants are and that lists, or has a list of, the tourist s pots that you will want to see. It's also called a “travel book” or a “travel guidebook. ”

 Edmundo and I “went to the major museums, saw a pla y, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Island Ferry.” “M useums” (museums) are places where you can see art and other cultural thi ngs. A “play” is a live performance in a theater. And a “concert,” of cours e, is live music that you go to hear in a public place. Edmundo and I “went to a co ncert in Central Park.” “Central Park” in New York City is a very large, ve ry famous park. It is located in the middle of Manhattan, which is one of the island s that is part of New York City.

I also said that we went on the Staten Island Ferry . There are five different sections of New York City, called “boroughs” (borou ghs). The main downtown borough is called “Manhattan,” which is also the na me of the island it is located on, but there's another island that is also part of  New York City called “Staten Island.” And there is a famous “ferry” (ferry) that  goes between Manhattan and Staten Island. A “ferry” is a boat that takes peopl e and often cars across a short distance of water. In Hong Kong, for example, there  is a ferry between the island and the mainland, or the main part of the country. And many other countries also have ferries that go out to nearby islands.

I said that my trip was “a whirlwind.” A “whirlwind ” (whirlwind) here means a period of time that goes by very quickly, in which you do many things within a very small amount of time. Lucy says, “You guys mus t have been exhausted.” The term “guys” can refer to just a man. But we als o use it informally sometimes to refer to both men and women. It can mean you two , or you all, or you people. Here it just means you and Edmundo. “To be exhauste d” means to be very tired. “I worked all day. I'm exhausted.”

I mentioned that “the rest of my trip was pretty lo w-key.” “Low-key” (low-key) means very relaxed, very calm. We sometimes use this term to describe someone who doesn't get excited easily: “He's very low-key.” I said my friends “rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate Ne w York.” “To rent a car” means to pay money so that you can drive a car that  belongs to a car rental company. You can rent a car. You can rent a motorcy cle. You can – well, you can't really rent a horse easily in the city, but I  suppose it's possible in some places.

A “road trip” is a trip we take by driving somewher e. “I'm going to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. It's about a five-hour ro ad trip.” Road trips usually are vacations. We don't talk about taking a road trip i f you are traveling somewhere for business, typically. Upstate New York is the pa rt of New York State that is north of New York City. So, when we say “Upstate Ne w York,” we mean a part of New York State that is not in New York City.

 Lucy asked, “Did you have to stay over in a hotel a long the way, or did you drive straight through?” “To stay over” is a two-word phr asal verb that means to stop and spend the night somewhere. You could stay over in a hotel or you could stay over at a friend’s house. It means to stay there ov ernight. “Along the way” means on the route or on the way to where you are going. “We are going to the beach, and along the way we are going to stop and buy some  soda and some food.” “To drive straight through” means not to stop. “I'm going to drive straight through from Los Angeles to Phoenix” means I'm not going to stop  and stay overnight anywhere. I'm going to drive the whole distance in one day.

I told Lucy that “we didn't bother with booking hot el rooms.” “To book (book) a room” means to reserve a room. You can book a hotel  room. You can also book an airline ticket. “I booked a ticket to New York” means I reserved or I bought an airplane ticket. I said that we were only in upstat e New York for two days and that we “drove back and got back last night.” “To drive back” means to return by car from someplace, and “to get back” means simply to a rrive, to come back to where you started from. “So, what time did you get back last night?” means “What time did you return last night?”

I had some problems with my trip to Los Angeles. Fi rst, “my flight was cancelled.” “To be cancelled” (cancelled) means to not occur, to not happen – to be “called off,” we might also say. So, if your flight is “can celled,” it means that the airline has decided that your airplane, your flight, is not  going anywhere. Since my flight was cancelled, “I was rebooked onto another flight that had a three-hour layover in Chicago.” “To be rebooked” means to be issued a ticket for a different flight – to be booked again.

I said I had “a three-hour layover in Chicago.” A “ layover” (layover) is when you are traveling by airplane and you have to stop at a nother airport and wait before you continue flying to where you are going. For exa mple, if I am going to fly to London from Los Angeles, I might have a layover in New York City, which is in between Los Angeles and London when you fly there. The flight – my airplane – will stop in New York City, and I may have to get o n a different airplane to continue on to London. The opposite of a layover is  a “direct flight.” “I have a direct flight to Tokyo” means there will be no stop s between here and Tokyo. There will be no layovers, except maybe in Hawaii i f I'm lucky.

I described my return trip as “a major pain.” To say something was “a major pain,” or simply “a pain,” means it caused a lot of  problems. It caused a lot of trouble. Lucy responded by saying, “It sounds like it.” The expression “It sounds like it” means it sounds that way, or it appears th at way, or simply, “I understand.”

It's an expression we use in conversation. It is si milar to “Oh, yeah?” in that it shows you are listening to the other person. Someon e might say, for example, “I had to work late last night. I got home and I was very tired. I was exhausted.” And you might say, “Oh, yeah? It sounds like it.”

Lucy said, “I'm glad you made it back okay.” “To ma ke it back” means to come back or to arrive back safely, to return safely. “W hat time did you make it back last night?” means the same as “What time did you r eturn last night?” or “What time did you get back last night?” Notice that the word “back” can be used with a lot of different verbs to mean return.

Finally, Lucy said that I had the weekend “to rest up for work on Monday.” And I said that I needed “to catch up on my sleep.” “To r est up” is a phrasal verb that means to get some sleep, to relax, to rest. The ver b “to rest up” means the same, really, as to rest, but as with many verbs in Engli sh, we sometimes add a preposition like “up” or “over” or “back” to add em phasis to the word. “To catch up on my sleep” means to get back some of the sleep th at I am missing. “I need to catch up on my sleep” means I haven't slept enough in the last few nights, and so now I need to sleep a lot so that I will feel reste d.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Lucy: Hello.

Jeff: Hey, Lucy, it's Jeff.

Lucy: Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?

# At the Movies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 26 – At the Movies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 26. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss going to the movies over the weekend. Let's get started. > My friend Jim and I decided to see the latest block buster this weekend. I like a good action movie once in a while. We decided to me et at the movie theater after work.
> When I got to the theater, I looked around and didn 't see Jim. So, I thought I would get in line to buy tickets. There were two di fferent lines, so I asked a woman standing in the first one, "Is this the line for Mission Impossible 4 ?" She said, "Yes, I'm afraid it is." I turned around and saw why she said that. The line was really long and had about 20 people in it alrea dy. Oh, well. I went to the back of the line and waited.
> About 10 minutes later, I saw Jim coming up the esc alator. When he got off the escalator, he looked out of breath. He said, "Hey, sorry for being so late. I hit a lot of traffic on the way over." I told him, "Don't wor ry about it. As you can see, we have a long wait."
> We finally got to the head of the line and walked u p to the ticket window. The clerk behind the ticket window asked, "Can I help y ou?" I said, "Two tickets for MI-4, please." We weren't children, students, or se niors, so there were no special discounts for us. The clerk handed me two tickets a nd we headed inside. There was a ticket taker just inside the door. He took ou r tickets and handed back our stubs.
> Coming straight from work, I was really hungry. Jim  and I went to the concession stand and got a couple of Cokes, hot dogs, a tub of  popcorn, and a box of candy. We were set. We went into the screening room and it  was packed. Luckily for us, we found some seats together that weren't too close  to the screen.
> Today I talked about my friend Jim and me going to see a movie. The movie was “the latest blockbuster.” A “blockbuster” (blockbus ter) is a very successful movie or book, one that is very popular. I said, “I like a good action movie once in a while.” An “action (action) movie” is a movie with lots of car chases, fights, and violence. That’s an action movie.

I said that Jim and I “decided to meet at the movie  theater after work.” When we say “after work,” we mean after we are finished wit h our jobs. When I got to the movie theater, I thought I would “get in line to bu y tickets.” “To get in line” means to stand in line with other people who are also buy ing tickets. “Tickets” (tickets) are what you need to get into the movie theater. A ticket is a little piece of paper that they give you that allows you to enter the the ater where the movie is showing or playing.

I said that I wasn’t sure which line I should get i nto or stand in, so I asked a woman if this was the right line for my movie, and she said, “Yes, I’m afraid it is.” The expression “I’m afraid” here doesn’t mean that she is actually scared or afraid of something. It’s an expression we use some times when we have to tell someone some bad news. “I’m afraid that you failed the test,” the teacher might say to the student; it’s bad news. So, we use the e xpression “I’m afraid” when we’re telling people some news they probably don’t want to hear.

I decided to get into the line, and I used the expr ession “Oh, well.” “Oh, well” is an expression that we use to mean, “Well, I guess I  can’t do anything about it” or “That’s just the way that it is.” I can’t change it . Oh, well. I said that I went “to the back of the line.” A line of people can be thought of as having three parts: the “head of the line,” which is the front; the “middle  of the line”; and the “back of the line,” which is the end of the line.

My friend “got off the escalator.” An “escalator” ( escalator) is a set of stairs that moves mechanically. It’s a moving staircase. Notice  the verb we use: “to get off” the escalator. You can also use that verb for an el evator. An “elevator” (elevator) is something that goes straight up and straight dow n in a building and takes you from one floor to another floor. You “get on” the e levator and you “get off” the elevator, just as you get on and get off the escala tor. You can also get on or get

off an airplane or a boat or a bus. Jim “got off the escalator” when he reached the end of it.

I said that Jim “looked out of breath.” “To be out of breath” means you are breathing very hard and very fast, possibly because  you have just been running or walking quickly up some stairs. Jim told me that  he “hit a lot of traffic on the way over.” “To hit traffic” means that you’re drivi ng and suddenly there are a lot of cars on the road at the same time, and everyone has to slow down. “On the way over” means on my way here – on my way to the theater, in this case.

When Jim and I got to the head of the line, we “wal ked up to the ticket window.” The “ticket window” (window) is the place in a movi e theater or any sort of theater where you buy tickets. So, we walked up to the tick et window, and because we were not children or students or seniors, “there we re no special discounts for us.” Movie theaters in the United States often give a “d iscount” (discount) – a lower price – if you are a child or if you are a student at the university or if you are over a certain age, usually 65 years old. We call those who are over 65 years old “seniors.”

I said the clerk “handed me two tickets” and “we he aded inside.” “To hand” something to someone means to give it to them; you are giving something to them with your hand. “To head inside” means to go i nside or to go in the direction of. “I am headed to San Francisco” means I am going  in the direction of San Francisco.

When we got inside, there was “a ticket taker.” A “ ticket taker” is the person who takes your ticket so you can get inside the theater . In this case, the ticket is torn or ripped in half, and the ticket taker gives you b ack half of the ticket, sort of like a receipt. That little part of the ticket that you get back is called a “stub” (stub). So, the ticket taker “handed back,” or gave back, “ our stubs.”

I said that I had come straight from work. When we say, “I came straight from work” or “I came straight from school,” we mean tha t we didn’t stop anywhere. We didn’t stop to eat. We didn’t stop at home. We w ent directly from one place to another place. You can “come straight from” any loc ation, any place. “I went to my girlfriend’s straight from work.” Well, right af ter going to the bar with my friends.

If you want to buy some food in a movie theater or any sort of theater or stadium, you have to go to the “concession stand.” A “conces sion (concession) stand” is a place where they sell food and drinks, and sometime s other things like shirts and hats, if it’s in a sports stadium. In a theater, a concession stand sells soda, like

Coca-Cola. They also sell popcorn, and usually they  put the popcorn in a big container that we call a “tub” (tub). “A tub of pop corn” is a big container of popcorn, like a big bowl of popcorn.

“We went into the screening room and it was packed. ” There are two parts to most movie theaters. There’s the “lobby,” which is outside of the screening room and where you’ll find the concession stand and the “restrooms,” or public bathrooms. And then there’s the “screening (screeni ng) room,” which is where all the seats are and where you actually watch the movi e. Sometimes we just call this the “movie theater,” although the term “movie theater” can also refer to the entire building. Nowadays, many movie theaters have  more than one screening room. Sometimes there are a dozen or more screening  rooms in a single theater, so that instead of having one or two bad movies to choose from, you have twelve.

I said the screening room “was packed.” When we say  something is “packed,” we mean that it is full. It is very, very full. When a  theater is packed, almost every seat is taken. We can also use that expression for other things. We can say, for example, “I went to my friend’s party and his house  was packed” – his house was very full of people. I then said that we “found som e seats together that weren't too close to the screen.” The “screen” (screen) is the big white thing that we watch the movie on. It’s what is hanging on the wal l at the front of the screening room. We say that the movie is “projected onto” or “shown on” the screen.

I said we “watched 10 minutes of previews.” In most  movies that you go to in the U.S., there are a lot of “previews.” “Previews” (pr eviews) are basically commercials or advertisements for other movies that  are going to be showing at the movie theater soon. Usually the previews last a bout 10 minutes and are shown before you get to watch the actual movie you came to see.

I said that Jim and I “wolfed down our food.” “To w olf (wolf) down” means to eat very quickly. When you’re really, really hungry, yo u may eat your food very fast. The informal expression for this is “to wolf down.”  A “wolf” is an animal that is the enemy of “sheep,” which are the animals that we get  wool from. But the idea here is that a wolf eats very quickly. So, “to wolf down ” your food means that you are eating like a wolf.

The kind of food that you buy in a movie theater is  what we would call “junk food.” “Junk” (junk) is garbage – something that’s not worth very much, something that isn’t very good. We call that junk. Well, “junk food” is food like popcorn and hot dogs and potato chips. It’s not goo d for you, but it tastes really good.

 Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

My friend Jim and I decided to see the latest block buster this weekend. I like a good action movie once in a while. We decided to me et at the movie theater after work.

When I got to the theater, I looked around and didn 't see Jim. So, I thought I would get in line to buy tickets. There were two di fferent lines, so I asked a woman standing in the first one, "Is this the line for Mission Impossible 4 ?" She said, "Yes, I'm afraid it is."

We went into the screening room and it  was packed. Luckily for us, we found some seats together that weren't too close  to the screen.

We sat back and waited for the movie to start. Whil e we watched 10 minutes of previews, we wolfed down our food. By the time the movie started, I was feeling pretty good. I don't know which was better, the mov ie or the great junk food!

Let's get started. > I was driving down the Santa Monica Freeway yesterd ay, headed toward downtown, when all of a sudden I saw my engine ligh t come on. Needless to say, that's not the sort of thing one likes to see. So, I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and parked on the shoulder. I popp ed the hood and looked to see what the problem might be. I'm no mechanic – I barely know how to check the oil and the wiper fluid – but perhaps something  would jump out at me.
> The car didn't overheat, since there was no steam c oming out of the radiator. I checked the battery cables, and the battery was def initely not dead. I didn't know quite what else to do, so I pulled out my cell phon e and called AAA for a tow to the nearest repair shop. I started worrying about a ll the things it could be: the fuel pump, the transmission, the electrical system. Who knows? I just had new brakes put in a month ago, so I knew it couldn't be that.
> The tow truck finally arrived and we went to a near by mechanic. He checked everything and then told me that he had found the p roblem: the engine light sensor was broken! I now had to take it to the deal er to get it fixed. Well, at least it didn't end up costing me an arm and a leg.

Today we’re talking about a common problem if you d rive a car, and that is “car trouble.” “Car trouble” (trouble), or “automobile t rouble,” is when you have problems with your car. I said, “I was driving down  the Santa Monica Freeway.” “To drive down” means the same as “to drive on.” Bu t most people don’t say, “I’m driving on the street.” They say, “I’m driving down  the street,” meaning I’m moving in a certain direction. We also drive down h ighways and freeways. A “freeway” (freeway) is a major road where there are  no stop signs. In this story, I was driving on the “Santa Monica Freeway.”

 In the United States, we have a national system of roads. These roads are called the “interstate highways” and all of these highways  have numbers. The odd- numbered freeways go north and south, and the even- numbered freeways go east and west. So, Interstate 35, or Highway 35, go es from north to south, and Highway 94 goes from east to west. In some states, such as California, we give a name to the freeway in addition to its number. The name is usually where the freeway starts or where the freeway ends. So, the S anta Monica Freeway, which is also called “the I-10” or “Interstate 10,” begin s in Santa Monica, just about a mile from me.

As I was driving, “all of a sudden” – suddenly – “I  saw my engine light come on.” The “engine (engine) light” is a little light that tells you that there is something wrong with your engine, or your motor. The engine l ight is in front of you when you are driving. It is just behind the steering whe el, which is what you turn to move the car left and right. The area in front of the steering wheel is called the “dashboard.” The “dashboard” (dashboard) is where y ou can see how fast you are driving and how much gas you have left. And, if  you have a problem with your engine, the dashboard is where the engine ligh t will come on.

In most cars, there are several different kinds of lights: the engine light, the oil light, and so forth. I said that I saw the engine l ight “come on.” We use the verb “to come on” when a light activates automatically o r electronically all on its own – we say it “comes on.” I wouldn’t say the engine lig ht “turns on,” because there isn’t a person actually turning it on. I then said,  “Needless to say, that’s not the sort of thing one likes to see.” “Needless to say” means obviously. When a person says, “Needless to say, if it’s raining you should bring an umbrella,” this means it is obvious that you should do that.

After I saw my engine light come on, “I pulled over  to the side of the road and parked on the shoulder.” “To pull over” means to mo ve your car off the road or the street or the freeway. That is the expression: “to pull over.” If a police officer tells you to pull over, that’s usually bad news. Th at means that he or she is going to give you a ticket. A “ticket” is a fine for doing something wrong when you are driving, like going too fast, which of course you s hould never do.

I pulled over and parked “on the shoulder.” The wor d “shoulder” (shoulder) here is the same as the shoulder of your arm, but when I  say, “I parked on the shoulder,” it means the side of a freeway or a high way. There isn’t a shoulder on most streets; we usually use the word “shoulder” for freeways or highways. After I pulled over, “I popped the hood” to see what the problem might be. “To pop (pop) the hood (hood)” means to open the hood. The hood is in the front of your

car, and it’s like a door that you open to see the engine. In most cars nowadays, to pop or to open the hood you need to press a butt on inside your car that unlocks the hood.

I said, “I’m no mechanic.” A “mechanic” (mechanic) is a person who fixes cars. “I barely know how to check the oil and the wiper flui d.” “To barely know” something means to know only a very small amount, to know only a little. “To check the oil” means to look and see that there is enough motor oil in the engine. “Motor oil” is a liquid made of petroleum that your  engine, or your motor, needs in order to run.

“Wiper fluid” means windshield wiper fluid. A “wind shield” (windshield) is the window in the front of your car. We don’t use the t erm “window” for that window; we have a special word for it, which is “windshield .” The “wiper” (wiper) is the little stick that is on the windshield. You usually  have two of them. They go back and forth to clean the windshield. And “wiper fluid ” (fluid) is the liquid that helps to clean the windshield when the wipers are moving.

I opened the hood to see if anything would “jump ou t at me.” We use the expression “to jump out at” when we are looking at many different things and we’re trying to identify something, but we’re not q uite sure what that something is. So, for example, someone gives you a list of na mes and says, “There’s someone you know on this list.” But he doesn’t tell  you the name of the person, so you look at the list and hope that some name wil l “jump out at you,” meaning you will suddenly notice it. When something jumps o ut at you, you might say, “Oh, there it is!”

I said that the car “didn’t overheat.” “To overheat ” (overheat) means that the car becomes too hot. There is something in the front of  the car called the “radiator” (radiator) that has water in it to keep the engine cool. But when a car overheats, the radiator water becomes so hot that you begin to  see steam coming out. “Steam” (steam) is water in a gas or vapor state. W hen you boil water in a pan, steam will come off the top of the water. When stea m comes out of your radiator, that means that your car engine is too hot: it over heated.

But that wasn’t the problem. Then I checked my “bat tery cables.” Your “battery” (battery) is what runs the electrical parts of your  car. The battery is connected to the engine with “cables,” which are long strings of  metal. When a battery stops working, we say that it “dies.” Just like a living thing can die, a battery can die, and when a battery doesn’t work anymore, we say it is “dead” – there’s no more power left in it. But my battery wasn’t dead.

I said that I didn’t know what else to do, so I “ca lled AAA for a tow to the nearest repair shop.” “AAA” stands for American Automobile Association. It’s a national, private organization kind of like an insurance comp any. I think it costs around $50 or $60 a year to become a member, and if your c ar breaks down or stops working, you can call them and they will tow you so mewhere to get your car fixed.

“To tow” a car is to have another vehicle – in this  case, a “tow truck” – pull your car somewhere. That’s a “tow (tow) truck,” not “toe ” (toe) like a toe on your foot. The tow truck tows your car to a repair shop. A “re pair (repair) shop” is a place where a “mechanic” – someone who fixes cars – works . We sometimes call these repair shops “garages.” “I need to take my ca r to the garage” means I need to get it fixed at a repair shop by a mechanic.

I said that there were several things that could be  wrong with my car: “the fuel pump, the transmission, the electrical system.” The  “fuel (fuel) pump” is a little thing in your motor, in the front of your car, that  pushes the gasoline into the engine. The “transmission” is the gears of your car . A “gear” is a wheel that controls the speed of your car. If you have a manua l transmission, you can put your car in first gear, second gear, third gear, an d so forth. Or you could have an automatic transmission that changes gears for you. The “electrical system” in your car is what controls your lights and all of the things that use electricity.

I had “new brakes put in a month ago.” “To put in” or to install brakes means that you put in new brake parts. The “brakes” (brakes) a re what you use to stop a car. You hit the brakes. There are two pieces of metal i n your car underneath the dashboard. These are called “pedals (pedals).” One pedal you press to go fast or slow: that is your gas pedal. The other pedal you p ress to slow or stop your car – that is your brake pedal.

The tow truck arrived and “we went to a nearby” – o r close – “mechanic.” He checked everything and he told me that my “engine l ight sensor was broken.” A “sensor” (sensor) is a thing that can detect or can  find out if there is a problem. If the sensor is “broken,” or not working, it could co me on even though there isn’t a problem. So, my engine light sensor was not working , but there was no serious problem with my car.

I said I now had to take it in to the “dealer” to g et it fixed. A “dealer,” or a “car dealer,” is someone who sells cars. And in the Unit ed States, the company that sells the car usually has its own mechanics and its  own repair shop where you need to get any specialized work done. Finally, is aid that “at least it didn’t end up costing me an arm and a leg.” The expression “to co st an arm and a leg” means

to be very expensive. Something that costs a lot of  money would cost you an arm and a leg.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > I was driving down the Santa Monica Freeway yesterd ay, headed toward downtown, when all of a sudden I saw my engine ligh t come on. Needless to say, that's not the sort of thing one likes to see. So, I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and parked on the shoulder. I popp ed the hood and looked to see what the problem might be. I'm no mechanic – I barely know how to check the oil and the wiper fluid – but perhaps something  would jump out at me.
> The car didn't overheat, since there was no steam c oming out of the radiator. I checked the battery cables, and the battery was def initely not dead. I didn't know quite what else to do, so I pulled out my cell phon e and called AAA for a tow to the nearest repair shop.

# Cashing a Check

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 28 – Cashing a Check.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 28. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss cashing a c heck. Let's get started. > The local branch of my bank is located just a few b locks from where I live. It's very convenient, since it has four ATMs open 24/7. Today I had to go make a deposit, but because I wanted to cash a check as we ll, I needed to go inside to talk to a teller.
> Inside the bank, I got in line for the tellers. All  of the tellers are behind a large piece of bulletproof glass, so you have to speak up  when you are talking to them. When I got to the head of the line, the cashier ask ed, "How may I help you?" I said, "I'd like to deposit this payroll check into my checking account and cash this cashier's check." "Certainly," she said, "just endo rse the back of both checks and put them in the tray." I said, "Sure. And can I get  that in small bills – tens and twenties?"
> I waited for her to process my checks. Then she sai d, "Here you are," and counted out the cash and put it in an envelope. "Th ank you," I said, and walked away. Now that I have some money burning a hole in my pocket, I guess I’d better spend it!

Today we talked about going to the bank. I started by talking about “the local branch of my bank.” A “branch” (branch) of a bank o r a “branch” of any business is an office of that bank or an office of that busi ness. Big banks have many branches in different parts of the city and in diff erent parts of the country. I said my local branch is located “just a few blocks from where I live.” A “block” (block) is the distance between two streets.

I mentioned that my local bank has “four ATMs.” “AT M” stands for “automatic teller machine.” A “teller” (teller) is the person who works at the bank whom you

talk to about cashing a check or making a deposit o r getting money. An “automatic (automatic) teller machine” is a machine  that you can use to get money out of your bank account. You put in your car d and enter your PIN – “PIN” (PIN) stands for “personal identification number,” and is like a secret code. An ATM is usually open “24/7.” The expression “24/7” is written (24/7). “24/7” means 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So, if a busines s is open 24/7, it is always open; it is never closed.

I said that I had to go to the bank to “make a depo sit.” A “deposit” (deposit) is money that you put into your bank account to save. That’s called a deposit. The opposite is called a “withdrawal.” “To withdraw (wi thdraw) money” means to take money out of your bank account. I want to withdraw some money; I want to make a withdrawal.

I needed to “cash a check.” “To cash a check” means  to go to a bank, or sometimes to a store, and give them a “check,” a pi ece of paper with your name and account number on it. You sign the check and th ey give you cash back. In the United States, there are many small businesses that are not banks that will cash your check. But they will charge you money for  that service, and they are used primarily by people who do not have bank accou nts.

A “teller,” as I mentioned, is the person who works  in the bank and helps you with your deposits and withdrawals. Once inside the bank , “I got in line for the tellers.” “To get in line” means to stand in line. In many ba nks in the United States, the tellers are behind a large piece of “bulletproof gl ass.” You know what glass is, like a glass window. Well, “bulletproof (bulletproo f) glass” is like a very thick window that we use for safety. If someone were to f ire a gun in order to shoot the teller and steal the money, the glass would stop the bullet. That’s bulletproof glass. Many banks, especially here in Los Angeles, have bulletproof glass, and the tellers work behind the glass.

You and the teller are on different sides of the bu lletproof glass, which is why you sometimes have to “speak up.” “To speak up” means to talk louder. If we say, “I need you to speak up,” we mean, “I need you to talk  louder.” “To speak up” can also mean simply to say something. For example, “If  you want to go to the store, speak up” means “If you want to go to the store, te ll me.” It doesn’t mean to talk louder. It just means to tell me or to let me know.

When I got to the cashier – in a bank, “cashier” (c ashier) is another word for “teller” – she asked, “How may I help you?” This is  a very common thing to say when someone first talks to you in a store, for exa mple. A person working for the store will often say, “How may I help you?” I respo nded by saying that I needed

to deposit a “payroll check.” A “payroll (payroll) check” is a check that you get from your employer for doing your job, for working.  I have a very small payroll check, for example.

I wanted to deposit my payroll check into my “check ing account.” There are two main kinds of accounts or places where you can stor e your money in a bank. One is a “checking account.” That’s an account that  you can write checks from. The other is a “savings account,” which is an accou nt that you get your money out not by writing a check, but by actually going to the bank.

Nowadays, we also have other ways of saving or stor ing money. There are “certificates of deposit,” also known as “CDs.” A “ certificate (certificate) of deposit” is an account where you can keep your mone y for a certain amount of time – six months or nine months or a year – and the bank gives you extra interest, extra money, for leaving it in the certif icate of deposit. You promise not to take the money out before the end of the six mon ths or nine months or year, but if you do take it out early, you get a “penalty ” or a “fine,” which means you have to pay money for taking the money out early.

I said that I needed to “cash a cashier’s check.” T here are two types of checks: a “cashier’s check” and a “personal check.” A “cashie r’s (cashier’s) check” is a check that has the bank’s name on it instead of you r name. A “personal (personal) check” has your name on it, and the mone y comes right out of your account. Many people will accept only cashier’s che cks for large amounts of money, because the bank is guaranteeing that the mo ney will be there. I can write a personal check and there may be no money in  my account, but you don’t know that. If I give you a cashier’s check, you kno w that the bank will cash it because it has the bank’s name on it. That’s a cash ier’s check.

The teller asked me to “endorse” the check. “To end orse” a check means to put your signature on the back of it so that the bank k nows that it’s really you who is cashing or depositing the check. I asked for my money “in small bills.” A “bill” is a piece of paper money, and different bills have diff erent values. There are $1 bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, $20 bills, $50 bills, and $100  bills. The highest-value bill currently used in the U.S. is the $100 bill. Every kind of bill has a different person’s picture on it, usually a president.

When we say, “I want tens and twenties” or “I want fives and tens,” using the plural form, we mean “I want $10 and $20 bills” or “I want $5 and $10 bills.” “Small bills” are $1 bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, an d $20 bills. Large bills are $50 and $100 bills. After giving me my cash, the teller sai d, “Here you are,” meaning “Here’s your money.” She “counted out the cash.” “T o count out” money means

to physically count the cash in front of you so tha t you can see that it is all there. For example, if I’m giving you 100 dollars, I might  say, “Here’s 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100.”

After I picked up my money, I “walked away.” “To wa lk away” means to leave somewhere by walking. And I said, “Now that I have some money burning a hole in my pocket, I guess I’d better spend it!” The exp ression “money burning a hole in your pocket” means that you have some money now,  and you want to spend it so much that it is trying to burn its way out of yo ur pocket.

We often use this expression when, for example, we get paid at the end of the month or the end of the week: “This money is burnin g a hole in my pocket!” You’re not even sure what you want to spend it on, but you want to spend it on something.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > The local branch of my bank is located just a few b locks from where I live. It's very convenient, since it has four ATMs open 24/7. Today I had to go make a deposit, but because I wanted to cash a check as we ll, I needed to go inside to talk to a teller.
> Inside the bank, I got in line for the tellers. All  of the tellers are behind a large piece of bulletproof glass, so you have to speak up  when you are talking to them.

# Staying In

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 29 – Staying In.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 29. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss staying in on a Friday night. Let's get started. > It was Friday night, and my roommate and I felt lik e staying in. We both had had a tough week at work and decided to have a low-key evening. On my way home, I stopped at the video rental store and rented a co uple of movies. I got a new release and a classic. I thought I had left my memb ership card at home, but I found it at the last minute. I like going to my loc al rental store because it doesn't charge late fees. That's handy when I don't have ti me to return the DVDs the next day.
> My roommate and I were feeling too tired to go out to eat, so we decided to order in. We mulled over the take-out menus from restaura nts that had delivery service, but couldn't decide which restaurant to or der from. The trouble was that we had never eaten at the two restaurants nearby. O rdering from either one would be a crapshoot. In the end, we decided to jus t order a pizza. I called the restaurant and placed our delivery order.
> About a half hour later, the delivery person came to the door. I asked him if I could pay with a credit card, and he said, "Sure." I handed him my card and he wrote down the number. I signed the slip and added a tip to the total. He gave me a copy of the slip as a receipt and then handed me the pizza. I was really glad to get it; I was starving.
> With our movies and the pizza, we were all set. The re's nothing like a night at home, vegging out to get over a hectic week.

We heard me talking about what my roommate and I di d on Friday night. A “roommate” (roommate) is a person who lives with yo u. You could also call that person a “housemate.” Normally, when you say “roomm ate” or “housemate” you

are referring to someone you are not romantically i nvolved with and who is also not one of your relatives.

My friend and I “felt like staying in.” The express ion “to stay in” means to stay at home, not to go anywhere. The opposite of “staying in” is “going out.” When someone says, “I’m going out tonight,” they mean th ey’re not going to stay at home. They’re going to go to the movies or to a par ty or wherever they’re going.

I said that my roommate and I “had had a tough week  at work.” A “tough (tough) week” means a difficult week, a hard week, a week w ith many problems. So, we decided to have a “low-key evening.” “Low-key” (low -key) means calm, relaxed, without a lot of excitement. You can use that term “low-key” to describe an evening or a morning or any time of the day. You ca n also use it to describe a person. “He’s very low-key” means he’s very calm, h e’s very relaxed.

I went to the “video rental store.” A “video (video ) rental store” is a place where you can rent movies – nowadays, mostly DVDs, though  some video stores in the United States still have the old VHS tapes. I got “ a new release and a classic.” A “new release” (release) is a movie that is just now  available on DVD. We use the term “new release” for movies, and we also use it f or songs; a new song that has just come out is also a “new release.” A “classic” is an older movie that is still considered a very good movie. We use the expression  “it’s a classic” to describe movies or books or anything that is old but conside red to be of very high quality, to be very good.

I thought I had left my “membership card” at home, but I “found it at the last minute.” A “membership (membership) card” is a card  like a credit card, except it is used to show that someone is a member of a club or a group or, in this case, a video store. You need to have a membership card in order to rent movies at the video store. You can also have a membership card for other places, like a gym, for example. If it’s a commercial or a private gym,  you have to pay to become a member of the gym, and then you get a membership ca rd so you can use that particular gym. And while you’re working hard at the gym, I’m home watching a movie!

“At the last minute” means right at the very end of  when something is possible. So, we sometimes say to students, “Don’t wait until  the last minute to do your homework,”  meaning if your assignment is due tomor row morning, don’t wait until 10 p.m. tonight to start it. That would be wa iting until the last minute.

I said that I like going to the local video rental store because “they don’t charge late fees.” “Late fees” (fees) or a “late fee” is m oney that you have to pay if you

bring something back late, after it is due. Librari es in the United States, for example, charge a late fee if you bring a book back  a day late. You have to pay a late fee, also called a “fine,” for bringing it bac k late. But in the story, the local video rental store doesn’t charge late fees.

I said that it’s “handy” not to have late fees. Whe n we say something is “handy” (handy), we mean it is convenient – it makes our li ves easier. We also use the term “handy” to describe someone who is good at fix ing many different things. The old expression is “handyman” (handyman). A “han dyman” is very good at fixing things.

My roommate and I were “too tired to go out to eat, ” so we “decided to order in.” “To go out to eat” means to go out to a restaurant,  to go somewhere to eat other than your house. “To order in” means to stay at hom e and have food delivered to you by the restaurant. I said we “mulled over the t ake-out menus.” “To mull (mull) over” means to look at closely and to think about very carefully. We mulled over the take-out menus.

There are three ways you can buy food from a restau rant. You can “eat in,” meaning you eat at the restaurant. You can have it “delivered,” which means the restaurant brings the food to your house. Or, you can get “take-out.” “Take-out” (take-out) means you order your food from the resta urant and then you go and pick up the food and take it back to your house. Ma ny restaurants that have take- out menus also deliver.

My friend and I found two nearby restaurants that h ad delivery service, or the ability to bring the food to you. But “the trouble was” that we had never eaten at either of those restaurants before. The expression “the trouble was” is a common way to introduce a problem that you have. For examp le, if you are having difficulty deciding which pen you want to buy, you could say, “The trouble is, I don’t know if I want black ink or blue ink.” So, it ’s the way you can introduce or describe a problem.

We had never eaten at those two restaurants before,  so I said that ordering from either one would be a “crapshoot.” A “crapshoot” (c rapshoot) is a word that comes from a gambling game called “craps,” in which  you roll two dice down a long board, hoping to get certain numbers. Dice are  those little white cubes that have numbers or dots on each side and are used in g ambling and board games. One of them is called a “die,” and two or more are called “dice.” So, “craps” is a game that uses dice.

A “crapshoot” here, however, just means that you are gambling. You don’t really know how it will turn out – it’s something that is unknown. So, if you are deciding between two things, and you don’t know which one yo u should choose, you might pick randomly – you might just say, “I’ll tak e that one.” That’s a crapshoot. You’re not sure what the results will be; you just hope that you will be lucky and get something good.

The word “crap” is also a vulgar term in English, very similar to garbage. When we say, “That’s crap!” it means that something is b ad, terrible, garbage. But it’s a vulgar, informal expression. You do not want to say  that to your teacher or to your boss, at least not if you still want to work a t that job.

My roommate and I decided to just order pizza inste ad. I gave the delivery person my credit card, and I “signed the slip and a dded a tip to the total.” The “slip” (slip), or the credit card slip, is a little  piece of paper that you sign when you pay with a credit card. We call that a slip. And a “tip” (tip) is the extra money that you give a service person or a waiter for giving go od service. In the United States, it’s usually between 10 and 20 percent, dep ending on the service.

I said that I was glad the pizza arrived, because I  “was starving.” “To starve” literally means not to have any food to eat – to di e from not having enough food. But here we use it informally to mean very, very hu ngry. I said that with our movies and the pizza, we were “all set.” When we say we are “all set,” we mean we are completely ready for something. “Are you all  set for your trip to San Francisco?” means “Are you ready? Have you done eve rything you need to do in preparation?”

I said, “There’s nothing like a night at home, vegg ing out to get over a hectic week.” “To veg (veg) out” means to relax and not do  anything very intellectual or anything that requires any work. So, “vegging out” would mean coming home, sitting down, and watching some stupid television p rogram for an hour or two and not doing anything very active. “To get over” means  to recover from. “To get over an illness” means to get better from that illness.

Finally, a “hectic week” is a week that has a lot of activity, too much activity. If you are too busy, then you are having a “hectic wee k.”

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

It was Friday night, and my roommate and I felt lik e staying in. We both had had a tough week at work and decided to have a low-key evening. On my way home, I stopped at the video rental store and rented a co uple of movies. I got a new release and a classic. I thought I had left my memb ership card at home, but I found it at the last minute. I like going to my loc al rental store because it doesn't charge late fees. That's handy when I don't have ti me to return the DVDs the next day.

My roommate and I were feeling too tired to go out to eat, so we decided to order in. We mulled over the take-out menus from restaura nts that had delivery service, but couldn't decide which restaurant to or der from. The trouble was that we had never eaten at the two restaurants nearby. O rdering from either one would be a crapshoot. In the end, we decided to jus t order a pizza. I called the restaurant and placed our delivery order.

About a half hour later, the delivery person came to the door. I asked him if I could pay with a credit card, and he said, "Sure." I handed him my card and he wrote down the number. I signed the slip and added a tip to the total. He gave me a copy of the slip as a receipt and then handed me the pizza. I was really glad to get it; I was starving.

With our movies and the pizza, we were all set. The re's nothing like a night at home, vegging out to get over a hectic week.

# At the Art Exhibit

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 30 – At the Art Exhibit.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 30. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss taking a tr ip to a museum. Let's get started. > I really wanted to see the new exhibit at the art m useum, and I invited Lucy to come along. We both like contemporary art, and this  was an exhibition by an artist we've both liked ever since she was up-and-c oming 10 years ago.
> This exhibit was a retrospective, so there was goin g to be a lot of different types of work by the artist. There would be some of the a rtist's paintings, her early work. There would also be some of her sculptures. H er most recent work is mixed-media. She is very versatile, and that's one of the reasons I like her work so much.
> We were going to the opening of the exhibition, wit h a wine and cheese reception for the artist. When we arrived in the main gallery , there were already a lot of people there. Looking around, I could see that some  of the people were artists themselves and others were art critics. I'm sure there were collectors there, too. I knew the curator and looked around for him. I spott ed him talking with a group of people in the corner.
> After a little while, the curator said a few words and then introduced the artist. We got a chance to meet her briefly and she was very g racious. I'm glad that someone with her talent has made it in the art worl d. That's not easy to do. And I think her best work is still to come.

Today we enter the world of art and art exhibits. I  talked about a trip that Lucy and I took to see an “exhibit at the art museum.” A n “exhibit” (exhibit) is a special collection of art that you go to see. Sometimes exh ibits are of one particular artist’s work, like the exhibit in the story. And s ometimes, they are of art from a

certain a period of time. For example, here in Los Angeles, a few years ago, there was an art exhibit about King Tut and ancient  Egypt; that was a special exhibit.

I said, “I invited Lucy to come along.” To ask some one “to come along” means to ask that person to go somewhere with you. The type of exhibit that Lucy and I saw was “contemporary art.” “Contemporary” (contemp orary) means of the current time period. So, “contemporary art” would b e art that was made within the last 10 years or so. Contemporary art is also somet imes called “modern art,” although the term “modern” can refer to anything fr om the 20th century or, now, the 21st century.

I said that we had both liked this artist “ever sin ce she was up-and-coming 10 years ago.” “Ever since” means after a certain time . For example, “Ever since I got back to Los Angeles, the weather has been beaut iful” means that the weather has been beautiful from the time I returned until n ow. “Up-and-coming” (up-and- coming) is an expression we use for anyone – an art ist, an actor, a politician – who is not yet famous or successful but will be in the future. Usually, we say this about a young artist or a young actor or anyone who  is just starting out but who will probably become very popular.

I said that the exhibit or “show” we went to see “w as a retrospective.” A “retrospective” (retrospective) is an exhibit that shows you the history of an artist’s work from the beginning. So, for example, a retrospective of movies by the famous Japanese director Kurosawa would include  his early films, such as Rashomon , as well as later films like The Seven Samurai . If you’ve never seen these movies, I can highly recommend them. And my a pologies to our Japanese listeners if I have mispronounced those names.

Back to our story, I said that this exhibit was a r etrospective, and that it included “some of the artist’s paintings.” “Paintings” (pain tings) are pictures that are made with paint: water-based paint, oil-based paint, acr ylic paint, and so forth. I said that the paintings were part of her “early work.” W hen talking about art, we use the word “work” to mean the things that the artist has produced. The exhibit also had some of the artist’s “sculptures.” “Sculptures”  (sculptures) can be made from many different materials. The “Venus de Milo,” the famous Greek statue in the Louvre Museum in Paris, was made from marble.

The most recent work by the artist we went to see w as “mixed-media.” In modern art, many times the artist will combine different t ypes of art: movies and music and pictures and so forth. When there are different  art media used at the same time, we say it is “mixed-media.” I said that the a rtist we saw was “versatile.” “To

be versatile” (versatile) means to be able to do ma ny different things. I am not very versatile, for example.

The exhibit included a special party to celebrate the start of the exhibit, called an “opening” (opening). In the movie world, the first time a movie is shown is called a “premier.” But for a paintor or a sculptor or any one whose work is shown in a museum, it is called an “opening.” You can have an opening at a museum. You can also have an opening at an art gallery. A “gall ery” (gallery) of art is a store that sells art, and it can also be part of a museum . So, we can use the term “gallery” to mean either part of a museum or a stor e that sells art.

At most openings, there is some sort of food and so mething to drink. The most common food and drinks, or “refreshments,” at an ar t opening are “wine and cheese.” “Wine” (wine) is, of course, something tha t you shouldn’t drink too much of, and “cheese” (cheese) is something very delicio us that is made from cow or goat milk. We would call this a “wine and cheese re ception.” “Reception” (reception) is just another word for a celebration or a party. An “art reception” is a very “low-key” party; there is not a lot of dancing  or loud music. An art reception is much quieter than a wedding reception, for examp le.

I said that I saw many different people at the open ing, and that some of the people I saw were “art critics.” A “critic” (critic ) is anyone who writes for the newspaper or is on television and comments or gives  an opinion about how good a movie is or how good a piece of art is.

I said that there were also probably “collectors” a t the opening. “Art collectors” (collectors) are usually people who have a lot of m oney who buy art to put in their homes. They call these people “collectors” because they collect the art – they keep the art. We also use the term “collectors” to refer to anyone who likes to collect certain things. For example, there are some  people who like to collect dolls and some people who like to collect famous ph otographs. These are also collectors.

The person at the museum who organizes the exhibits  is called a “curator.” The “curator” (curator) decides which pieces of art to show and how they will be displayed. I said that I knew the curator and that I “spotted him talking with a group of people.” “To spot” (spot) someone means to  find or to see the person you’re looking for in a large crowd or in a large r oom. For example, “I can’t find my wife in this crowded room, but then I spot her –  she’s the beautiful woman standing at the door.” That’s what “to spot” means.  You can also spot a thing: “I was walking down the street and I spotted a penny.”  So, I picked it up and put it in my pocket.

 The curator “said a few words.” The expression “to say a few words” means to stand up in front of a group of people and say some thing, but not for very long. That’s why we say “a few” words – not many words. O ften you will hear this expression at a party like a birthday party. Someon e will say to the person whose birthday it is, “Would you say a few words?” This m eans, “Will you stand up and say something to everyone?”

I said we were able to meet the artist, and that sh e was “very gracious.” “To be gracious” (gracious) means to be polite, to be kind , to be nice. I said that I was happy that “someone with her talent” had “made it i n the art world.” “Talent” (talent) is an ability or a gift. Usually, we talk about talent when we are talking about some special ability that someone has. “To ma ke it” means to be successful. “I hope to make it in the acting world”  means I hope to be successful in that area.

Finally, I said that I thought this artist’s best w ork was “still to come.” “Still to come” means that we’re still expecting it – it hasn ’t happened yet. “The end of this television series is still to come.” It’s in the future.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I really wanted to see the new exhibit at the art m useum, and I invited Lucy to come along. We both like contemporary art, and this  was an exhibition by an artist we've both liked ever since she was up-and-c oming 10 years ago.

This exhibit was a retrospective, so there was goin g to be a lot of different types of work by the artist. There would be some of the a rtist's paintings, her early work. There would also be some of her sculptures. H er most recent work is mixed media. She is very versatile, and that's one of the reasons I like her work so much.

# Getting Up

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 31: Getting Up.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 31. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy wake up an d get out of bed.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

On a weekday, I usually get up around 6:30 a.m., bu t I set my alarm to go off at 6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep a nother 10 minutes.  My roommate thinks I’m crazy, but doing this in the mo rnings actually helps me wake up.  I’m a night owl, not an early bird like she is , so I need an extra few minutes to get going in the morning.

One reason it’s so hard to get up is because my bed room and my bed are so comfortable.  I splurged and bought a bed with a ve ry soft, thick mattress.  I also have matching sheets and pillowcases, and a comfort er that is made of goose down.  Even my nightstand matches my sheets and the  rest of my bedroom.  I decorated it so that it would be restful after a bu sy day at work.

When I get up, the first thing I do is put on my ro be.  It’s always so cold in the apartment in the mornings, no matter what time of y ear it is.  Then, I usually make my bed.  I hated making my bed when I was litt le, but now it’s become a routine.  Sometimes, though, I’m so tired that I sl eep in for just a little too long and then, the bed definitely doesn’t get made.  On those days, I wish I could sleep in all day!

[End of story]

The verb to get, "get," up means to get out of your  bed - to leave your bed.  So, after you stop sleeping - after you wake up, then y ou get up - you get out of your bed.

Lucy begins her story by saying that "On a weekday, " that is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday - those are the wee kdays (all one word),

ESL Podcast 31 - Getting Up

weekday.  The other part of the week is called the weekend, Saturday and Sunday.

"On a weekday," what some people might also call a work day - a day they have to work, Lucy says she "usually gets up around 6:30 " in the morning, but she sets her "alarm to go off at 6:20."  Her alarm, "alarm,"  is what makes noise - what wakes her up, usually it is an alarm clock that you  can set the time to.  To set your alarm, "set," means to put it to the correct t ime.

So, she sets her alarm to go off.  We use the expre ssion, to go off, when we are talking about something that makes a large noise, f or example, such as a bell or an alarm clock.  You can also have a gun; the gun can go off means the gun fires and makes a noise.  Well here, we are using this ve rb, to go off, when we are talking about an alarm clock.

So, her alarm goes off at 6:20 - 20 after 6:00 in the morning - but she hits "the snooze button to sleep another ten minutes."  The s nooze button, "snooze," button, "button," is something on an alarm clock th at allows you to sleep a little more, usually for five or ten minutes.  So, it will  stop your alarm, and then five or ten minutes later the alarm will go off again.  So,  that is called the snooze button. The verb to snooze means to sleep, so it allows you  to sleep a little extra time.

There's an expression "if you snooze, you lose."  I f you snooze, you lose, which means if you fall asleep - if you are not awake, yo u may miss something important.  You will not win; you will lose if you are sleeping.  This used to happen to me when I was young, I would snooze, and then I would lose.  I would miss things because I was sleeping.  Now I try to s tay awake more.

Anyway, getting back to Lucy's story, well, she lik es to sleep another ten minutes. Her roommate thinks that she's crazy, but she says that using her snooze button in the morning helps her wake up.  Remember, to wak e up, "wake" up (two words), means to stop sleeping.

Lucy says that she's "a night owl, not an early bir d."  A night owl, "owl," means someone who likes to go to bed very late at night -  11:30 p.m., 12 o'clock midnight.  Someone who goes to sleep very late, we call that person a night owl. An owl is an animal that is normally awake and make s sounds at night.  In English the sound would be "who, who," or "who, who ," if it's a boy.  So, we have the night owl, and that is a term for somebody who stays up late.  The opposite would be an early bird.  An early, "early," bird.  An early bird is someone who

ESL Podcast 31 - Getting Up

wakes up and gets up early in the morning.  A night  owl will probably get up later in the morning.

There's an expression in English, "the early bird g ets the worm."  The early bird gets the worm, "worm."  A worm, "worm," is a little  animal that birds eat.  The worms live in the ground.  The idea is that if you get up early, you will get more done - you will get things that other people don't get because they get up later. So, the early bird gets the worm.  Well, Lucy is no t eating worms, but she does like to take a "few extra minutes to get going in the morning."  To get going means to get active - to start doing things.

"One reason," she says, "it’s so hard to get up is"  that her "bedroom and her bed are so comfortable."  She has a very nice, comforta ble bed.  She says that she "splurged and bought a bed with very soft, thick ma ttress" - a very soft, thick mattress.  Lucy said she splurged, the verb to splu rge, "splurge," means to spend a lot of money, even when it isn't necessary.  So, you want to buy something nice for yourself, you don't need it, it's not necessary  but you want it.  So, she spends a lot of money - she splurges - and buys a very nic e bed that has a nice, thick mattress.  A mattress, "mattress," is the part of the bed that you actually sleep on.  Usually, a mattress is something that has spri ngs in it - pieces of metal that go up and down that allow your body to be comfortab le.  So, this is a thick mattress - a big mattress - but it is also a soft m attress, so that you can lay down on the bed and it feels good on your body.  The opp osite of a soft mattress is a hard mattress.

Lucy says that she has "matching sheets and pillowc ases."  The sheet, "sheet," is what goes over the bed - what covers the bed so that the bed does not get dirty.  When we say the sheets are matching we mean  that the colors are the same or they are similar so they look good together .  Pillowcases, "pillowcases," (plural) pillowcases are what cover your pillows - what you put your head on when you sleep, that's called a pillow.  So, the pi llowcase goes over the pillow.

Lucy says she also has "a comforter made of goose d own."  A comforter is a thick blanket - a big blanket.  "Comforter," a thic k blanket.  This comforter "is made of goose down."  Goose, "goose," down, "down,"  (two words).  A goose is a kind of animal.  Down refers to the feathers of the animal, "feathers," the feathers.  The feathers are the things that a bird has that covers its skin.  They're usually long and very soft.  So, goose down pillows  or goose down comforters are considered very soft and they're very warm.

ESL Podcast 31 - Getting Up

Lucy says that even her "nightstand matches" her "s heets and the rest of the bedroom."  A nightstand, "nightstand," (one word) is a small table that you have next to your bed, where you can put your alarm cloc k and maybe a glass of water.  That's your nightstand.  Sometimes nightsta nds have what we call a drawer, "drawer."  A drawer is something that you p ut something into, like a little box that is in the table.

Lucy has a nightstand that matches - that has the s ame type of color as the rest of her bedroom.  She says that she decorated her be droom "so that it would be restful after a busy day at work."  To decorate, "d ecorate," means to make your room look nice - to make the colors, the pictures, other things that you have in the room look good - look nice together.  Lucy deco rated her room; she wants it to be restful, "restful."  To be restful means that  when you walk into the room, it's relaxing, it's comfortable, it allows you to be abl e to sleep easily.

Lucy says that when she gets up, the first thing sh e does is to put on her robe. To put on her robe, "robe."  A robe, which is somet imes called a bathrobe, is a large piece of clothing that you wear.  It covers the top of your body, and usually the bottom of your body, up to maybe your knees.  A nd, it is something that you wear often after a bath so that you don't get cold.   It's something you wear so that you can go into the bathroom and you don't need to put your clothes on.  Usually this is something you use in the morning after you shower or when you get up to go into your bathroom so you are not cold.

Lucy puts on her robe because it is "always so cold  in" her "apartment in the mornings."  So, cold here means very cold.  It's al ways very cold - it's always so cold in her apartment, "no matter what time of year  it is" - January, June, September - it's always cold.  "Then," she says, sh e usually makes her bed.  To make your bed means to put the sheets and the blank ets - the comforter - back on the bed so that it looks nice - so that it doesn 't look messy, "messy."  When we say the bed is messy we mean it is not made up -  it doesn't look nice.  This is my problem; I don't make my bed as often as I shoul d.  When you go to a hotel the maid makes your bed, "maid."  The maid is the p erson that comes in and cleans your room and makes your bed.  My mother wou ld say, when I was young, "I'm not your maid.  You have to make your o wn bed."  Actually, I think it would be a good idea for me to get a maid now, so I  don't have to worry about making my bed.

Lucy says she hated making her bed when she was lit tle - when she was younger - "but now it’s become a routine."  A routi ne, "routine," is something that you do - a normal way that you do something, usuall y on a regular basis.  So, my

ESL Podcast 31 - Getting Up

routine when I get up may be to go to the bathroom and clean my face.  Every day I do the same thing; that's my routine.

"Sometimes," Lucy says, she's "so tired that" she s leeps "in for just a little too long."  To sleep in (two words) means to sleep long er than you are supposed to. If you are supposed to wake up at 6:30 and you slee p until 7:00 that would be sleeping in.  When she sleeps in, her bed doesn't g et made, that is she doesn't make her bed.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regul ar speed.

[Start of story]

On a weekday, I usually get up around 6:30 a.m., bu t I set my alarm to go off at 6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep a nother 10 minutes.

# Cleaning Up and Putting on Make-Up

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 32: Cleaning Up and Putting on Make-up.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 32. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy cleaning u p and putting on her make-up. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I share a bathroom with my roommate, which is usual ly not a problem.  We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toilet clean , and we have separate medicine cabinets to keep our things.  There’s also room und er the sink for our hairdryers and tampons.

I start out by rinsing my mouth with some mouthwash  before flossing.  Then, I take out my toothbrush and toothpaste and brush my teeth.  I only wash my hair every other day so I put on a shower cap and don’t have to get out my shampoo and conditioner.  I like to take bubble baths when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do.  I lather up qui ckly and give my legs a quick shave.

I don’t wear a lot of make-up to work so I just put  on a little blush and a light- colored lipstick, and skip the mascara and eye shad ow.  I put a few hot curlers in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!

[End of story]

To clean up is to clean yourself - to make yourself  ready to go out of your house usually.  To put on make-up needs to put something,  usually, on your face that makes you look better.  This is something that wome n do.  I need make-up to make me look better because I'm so ugly, but I don' t normally wear make-up. But, more about that later!

Episode two begins with Lucy saying that she shares  a bathroom with her roommate - the other woman that she lives with in h er apartment.  They share the bathroom - they have only one bathroom, this "is usually not a problem,"

however.  Lucy says that each of them tries "to kee p the sink, tub, and the toilet clean."  The sink, "sink," is where you put the wat er - where you pour the water into in order to clean.  A tub, "tub," sometimes ca lled a bathtub, is a place where you put water.  It's usually a long box in your bat hroom that you put water into it and you then get into the water and you clean yours elf, kind of like when you go swimming.  You go in - your whole body goes into the water.  Well, that's what a tub is, it's a large, long container that you put w ater into in order to take a bath.  A toilet, "toilet," is what you use when you go to the bathroom, when you get rid of things out of your body.

In this bathroom, both Lucy and her roommate "have separate medicine cabinets."  They each have their own medicine cabin et.  A medicine cabinet, "medicine," cabinet, "cabinet," is something that y ou use to put your things - your bottles, your medicine, your toothpaste - things yo u use in your bathroom, you put them in a medicine cabinet.  It's a cupboard - it's a small area where you can put things.  Usually medicine cabinets have a mirro r on the front, which is also the door, and you can open up the medicine cabinet and get things out of it.

Lucy and her roommate "have separate medicine cabin ets."  Lucy says that "There’s also room under the sink for our hairdryer s and tampons."  When we say there is room, we mean there is space - there is a place for you to put things. The word room also refers to a part of your house o r a part of a building - the bedroom, the dining room, and so forth.  But here, it's used to mean space, so there is "room under the sink for" their "hairdryer s and tampons."  Hairdryers and tampons are two things that I do not use as a man.  A hairdryer, "hairdryer," (one word) is a machine that you use to, you can guess, dry your hair.  So, when you wash your hair and it is wet, you can use a hairdry er to make sure that it becomes dry.  I don't use a hairdryer because I don 't have any hair.  When I was young man and a boy I had hair, and I would use a h airdryer, but not anymore.

A tampon, "tampon," is something that I have never used.  A tampon is something that a woman or a girl would use, a girl between the age of 12 and up to a women of the age of 55 or 60 perhaps would hav e to use a tampon every month.  This is something that men do not have to d o.  Basically, a tampon is a long, thin piece of cotton that a woman puts in her  body to absorb or to prevent blood from coming out of her body during each month .  I don't think I need to say more.  A woman has something happen to her every mo nth, what we would call her period, "period."  Her period is when blood lea ves her body, and that is part of her menstrual cycle.  Menstrual, "menstrual," me ans monthly.  So, this is something that men do not have to worry about.  But  in this case, Lucy has hairdryers and tampons in her bathroom.

 "I start by rinsing my mouth," Lucy says.  That is,  when she first walks in to her bathroom she begins to clean up by rinsing her mout h out, or "rinsing her mouth." To rinse, "rinse," means to clean with water.  She rinses "with some mouthwash before" she flosses.  So, she takes some liquid mou thwash, "mouthwash," (one word) which is a kind of liquid soap for your teeth .  It helps clean your teeth and make your breath smell better, or at least it's sup posed to.  So, she rinses her mouth with mouthwash and then she flosses.  To flos s, "floss," means to take a piece of string and put it between your teeth to ge t food from between your teeth - to get rid of - to remove that small piece food t hat might be in your teeth.

After, Lucy takes out, or gets, her toothbrush and toothpaste and brushes her teeth.  So, she gets her toothbrush and puts on too thpaste, which is a kind of soap for your teeth, and she brushes, or cleans, he r teeth.  She only washes her "hair every other day."  That means that she doesn' t clean her hair every day, she does it every other day - Monday, Wednesday, Fr iday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday - every other day.

So, she puts "on a shower cap."  A shower, "shower, " cap, "cap," (two words) is a piece of plastic that you put on your head, and it covers your hair.  You put it over your hair so your hair does not get wet when you ta ke a shower.  It's called a shower cap.  Again, this is something that I do not  need.

Lucy says she doesn't need to "get out her shampoo and conditioner."  She doesn't need to get out, meaning she doesn't mean to remove it from the medicine cabinet.  Shampoo, "shampoo," is a liquid soap for your hair. Conditioner, "conditioner," is a liquid that you pu t on your hair after you shampoo to make your hair soft and nice.  That's shampoo, w hich cleans your hair, and conditioner that makes your hair soft, if you have hair.

Lucy likes "to take bubble baths when" she has time .  A bubble bath, "bubble," bubble bath, "bath," (two words) is a bath where yo u get into the tub and you have a liquid that you put into the water, usually it makes the water smell nice.  It is something that makes bubbles.  Bubbles are parts  of water that have air in them.  They are very light, and sometimes they go u p into the air.  It's like a little ball of water that has air in it; that's a bubble.

Lucy likes "to take bubble baths when" she has time , "but on a busy morning" she does not have time to take a bubble bath, so sh e has to take a shower.  She says, "a shower will have to do."  The expression, "have to do," means it will be

sufficient - it will be enough - it will be good en ough.  So, "a shower will have to do" - it will have to be good enough.

Then, she lathers up quickly and gives her "legs a quick shave."  To lather, "lather," up (two words) means to put liquid on you r body - soap or shampoo or what we would call shaving cream and move it back a nd forth - mix it with water until you have bubbles that cover your skin - this is to lather up - or covers your hair, to lather up with shampoo on your hair.  Lucy  lathers up and gives her "legs a quick shave."  Shave, "shave," can be a noun and a verb.  To shave means to remove hair from your body - from your skin.  Lucy says she gives her "legs a quick shave."  Women in the United States usually s have their legs - they get the hair off of their legs.  They'll also shave under their arms, what we would call their armpit, "armpit."  Your armpit is that space undern eath your arm that connects your arm to the rest of your body.  Men do not shav e their legs; they do sometimes shave their face, or like me, shave their  head.

Lucy says that she doesn't "wear a lot of make-up to work," meaning she doesn't put on a lot of things on her face in order to go to work.  She just puts "on a little blush and light-colored lipstick."  Blush, "blush,"  is a pink powder that women put, usually, on their cheeks.  That is the place undern eath or below your eyes, next to your nose - on either side of your nose, those a re your cheeks.  It's a pink powder.  Powder is when you take something and you break it up into very small pieces, and it's so small that you can take your ha nd and the pieces will stick to your hand - they'll be on your hand; this is powder .  So, blush is a powder that you put on your cheeks, well, women, usually, put o n their cheeks.

Lipstick, "lipstick," (one word) is a color that yo u put on your lips - the part of your mouth.  Women often put on red lipstick.  Lucy says  she puts on "light-colored lipstick," so not very dark - a very light color.  I do not wear lipstick usually, but women often wear lipstick; it makes their lips look  better.

Lucy says that she skips "the mascara and eye shado w."  To skip, "skip," means that she doesn't use it.  She doesn't use mascara, "mascara."  Mascara is a black or brown liquid that a woman puts on her eyelashes.   Your eyelash, "eyelash," (one word) are the little hairs that come out of yo ur eyes or come out of what we would call your eyelid, "lid," that's the piece of skin that covers your eyes.  On the end of your eyelid are eyelashes, and these are lit tle pieces of hair.  Women sometimes try to make those darker by putting on ma scara.

Eye shadow, "shadow," (two words) eye shadow is ano ther kind of powder, but it's powder that a woman puts on the eyelid - the s kin that covers the eye.  So, it has some color to it; that is called eye shadow.

Lucy says she puts "a few hot curlers in" her "hair  and" she's "ready for breakfast."  A curler, "curler," is a small piece of round plastic that women use to make their hair look better.  They heat up the plas tic, and usually there's some metal that they heat up, and they put it in their h air to make their hair more curly. Curly, "curly," is the opposite of straight.  Women  can put curls in their hair by putting hot curlers in them, and then their hair wi ll be curly.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[Start of story]

I share a bathroom with my roommate, which is usual ly not a problem.  We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toilet clean , and we have separate medicine cabinets to keep our things.  There’s also room und er the sink for our hairdryers and tampons.

I start out by rinsing my mouth with some mouthwash  before flossing.  Then, I take out my toothbrush and toothpaste and brush my teeth.  I only wash my hair every other day so I put on a shower cap and don’t have to get out my shampoo and conditioner.  I like to take bubble baths when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do.  I lather up qui ckly and give my legs a quick shave.

I don’t wear a lot of make-up to work so I just put  on a little blush and a light- colored lipstick, and skip the mascara and eye shad ow.  I put a few hot curlers in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!

# Eating Breakfast

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 33: Eating Breakfast

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 33. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy make and e at her breakfast. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

In the kitchen, the first thing I do is pour myself  a cup of coffee and I add a little skim milk and sugar.  My roommate usually makes a p ot when she wakes up for both of us since she gets up first.

I go the fridge to take out the eggs.  When I have time, I like to cook a hot breakfast, so I take out the frying pan, pour a lit tle oil in it, and turn on the front burner on the stovetop.  While the eggs are cooking , I put two pieces of bread into the toaster.  When the eggs are nice and brown  on the edges, I use a spatula to put them on a plate.  Some mornings, I h ave to settle for some cold cereal or just toast with jam, but it’s nice to sta rt the day with a sit-down meal when I get the chance.

When I’m done, I take my plate and my silverware to  the sink, where my roommate has left her breakfast dishes.  Since she makes the coffee in the morning, I wash the dishes.  It’s a pretty good arr angement.  I put a little dishwashing detergent on the sponge, scrub the dish es, and leave them in the drying rack to dry.

[End of story]

In this episode, Lucy eats breakfast.  She begins h er story by saying that "In the kitchen, the first thing" she does is to pour herse lf "a cup of coffee."  The first thing she does is pour herself a cup of coffee.  To  pour, "pour," means to take liquid from one container, such as a bottle or a co ffee pot, and put it into another container, such as a cup.

ESL Podcast 33 - Eating Breakfast

So, she pours herself "a cup of coffee" and adds "a  little skim milk and sugar." Coffee, "coffee," is a dark brown drink that you ca n use to wake up in the morning.  Most coffee, or regular coffee, has a cer tain drug called caffeine, "caffeine," and the caffeine helps people wake up.  If you don't want the caffeine, you can decaf coffee, "decaf."  Decaf is short for decaffeinated, meaning it doesn't have caffeine.

But, Lucy needs to wake up so she has a cup of regu lar coffee, and she puts in her coffee "a little skim milk and sugar."  Skim, " skim," milk is milk that doesn't have any fat in it.  You can have regular milk, two  percent milk with two percent fat, one percent milk, and skim milk with no fat.  She also puts in sugar, "sugar." Sugar is normally white; it has a sweet taste that it adds to food.

Lucy's "roommate usually makes a pot when she wakes  up," meaning she makes a pot of coffee.  A pot, "pot," is what the coffee is put in.  It's like a jug or a bottle; it's like a container for the coffee.  The reason the roommate makes the pot of coffee is because "she gets up first."

Lucy goes to "the fridge" and takes "out the eggs."   The fridge, "fridge," is short for refrigerator.  A refrigerator is where you put your food so it stays cold.  To keep it cold, you put it in a refrigerator.  If you  want it to be frozen, like ice, then you put your food in a freezer, "freezer."

Lucy takes out some eggs from the refrigerator.  Eg gs, "eggs," are, in this case, things that come from a chicken.  Before the chicke n develops it begins as an egg, and this is, of course, a popular dish - a pop ular food for an American breakfast.

Lucy says that when she has time, she likes "to coo k a hot breakfast," so she takes out, or gets, a "frying pan," pours "a little  oil in it," and turns "on the front burner on the stovetop."  A frying pan, "frying pan ," (two words) is a pan where you cook food.  Usually it's foods such as an egg o r meat or vegetables, and it goes on top of heat, and the heat comes from the bu rner.

A burner, "burner," is where the fire or the heat c omes on a stove.  The stove, or stovetop, is the part of the machine in your kitche n where you can cook food.  In our house, for example, you can turn on the burner and fire - flames we would say - start to come out.  And then, you put the pan  on top of the fire - on top of the flames, and you put the meat and the oil and the vegetables, or whatever you are cooking, in the frying pan.  To fry, "fry," is a way to cook food by putting it over heat in a pan.

ESL Podcast 33 - Eating Breakfast

 In addition to putting the frying pan on the burner , which is part of the stovetop, Lucy pours "a little oil in" the pan.  Oil, "oil," is a liquid fat that you put in a pan to help the food cook better.  Lucy says that when "th e eggs are cooking," she puts "two pieces of bread into the toaster."  Two pieces  of bread could also be two slices of bread.  A slice, "slice," is a piece of b read, in this case.

The toaster, "toaster," is a place where you put br ead and you heat it up so that the bread becomes brown.  We would say, "you toast the bread," using "toast" as a verb.  So, you toast toast in a toaster.  There y ou see the verb, the noun, and the noun, which is the machine where you make the t oast.

"When the eggs are nice and brown," meaning when the eggs are very brown, "on the edges," Lucy uses "a spatula to put them on  a plate."  The edge, "edge," of something is the very end of something - the ver y outer part, the part that is at the very end of the object.  So, when you take an e gg and you crack it, "crack," meaning you open the egg, you crack the egg and you  put the egg into the frying pan, the egg will form something like a circle, and  at the - around the egg are the edges.  Also, I should mention that the white part of the egg - the outside of the egg is called the eggshell, "shell," the eggshell, but you don't eat the eggshells normally.

Well, Lucy uses a spatula to put the eggs onto a pl ate - to take them out of the pan and onto a plate.  A spatula, "spatula," is a u tensil; it's something you use in the kitchen.  It is flat, usually square, that has a handle on it and you can use it to go underneath the food in a frying pan to lift the food out of the pan.

"Some mornings," Lucy says, she has "to settle for some cold cereal or just toast with jam."  The expression to settle for, "settle,"  for something means that you don't necessarily want that thing - it's not the be st thing, the thing you want the most, but it's okay - it's acceptable.  When someon e said, "I - I'm settled for something," they mean they weren't completely happy  but it was okay - it was good enough for them.  This is what my wife tells m e; she says, "Jeff, I settled for you."

Toast with jam is one of the things that Lucy settl es for for breakfast when she doesn't have time to make a hot breakfast.  Toast, we already know, is bread that is cooked - that is brown.  Jam, "jam," is a liquid  made from fruit, such as strawberries or cherries.  Cereal, "cereal," is a d ry food that you usually eat with milk.  I have cereal almost every day for breakfast  because I am not a good cook like Lucy, so if I did not eat cereal, I would not eat anything.

ESL Podcast 33 - Eating Breakfast

 Lucy says "it’s nice to start the day with a sit-do wn meal when I get the chance." A sit-down, "sit-down," meal is a meal where you ta ke your time, you relax, you sit down and you have something like a formal meal.   It's a - it's a more relaxed way of eating.

Lucy says that when she's done with her food - when  she has finished eating - she takes her plate and her silverware to the sink.   Silverware, "silverware," are the utensils that you eat with.  They're the knife,  the spoon, and the fork.  So, she takes her dirty dishes to the sink where her "roomm ate has left her breakfast dishes."  So, the roommate, who gets up earlier tha n Lucy, she has already put her dishes in the sink.

Lucy says that "Since she makes the coffee" - her r oommate makes the coffee - "in the morning," Lucy washes "the dishes.  It’s a pretty good arrangement," she says.  An arrangement, "arrangement," is, in this c ase, like an agreement.  It's something that to people say yes to, and they agree  to do something.  In this case, her roommate makes the coffee; Lucy washes the dishes.  In my house, my wife makes the dinner; I wash the dishes.  If I don't wash the dishes, I don't get to eat.

Lucy says that she "put a little dishwashing deterg ent on" a "sponge" to clean the dishes.  Detergent, "detergent," is another word for soap, a special kind of soap. In this case, it's soap for washing dishes, so it's  dishwashing detergent - dishwashing soap - it's the same.  You can also hav e detergent to wash your clothes, so the special soap you use to wash your c lothes in a machine would be called detergent.

Lucy puts the dishwashing detergent on a sponge.  A  sponge, "sponge," is a small piece of material that has holes in it and it 's used for washing dishes.  The water goes into the sponge, and because of these ho les, the water is absorbed by the sponge, that is it stays in the sponge so it  is good for cleaning.

Lucy scrubs her dishes, and then leaves "them in the dying rack to dry."  To scrub, "scrub," as a verb means to clean, usually b y moving your hand back and forth over what you are trying to clean.  It means to clean with using some muscle, we would say - using some energy - using so me force to clean it. There's also a noun, scrubs, with an "s" at the end , "scrubs," that means the clothing - the special clothing that doctors wear, especially doctors that are during surgery.  They wear scrubs, that's what we c all those pieces of special clothing.  Often, it's blue or white clothing.

ESL Podcast 33 - Eating Breakfast

 Lucy puts the dishes on the drying rack.  The dryin g, "drying," rack, "rack," is a place where you can put the dishes so that they dry , and a drying rack is usually made of plastic or metal, and it has places where y ou can put individual plates and usually a separate place for silverware, and yo u use it to dry the plates and the silverware.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[Start of story]

In the kitchen, the first thing I do is pour myself  a cup of coffee and I add a little skim milk and sugar.  My roommate usually makes a p ot when she wakes up for both of us since she gets up first.

# Doing Hair

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 34: Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 34. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy do her hai r and get dressed. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I go back into the bathroom to finish doing my hair .  Before I put the hot curlers in, I had put a little gel in my hair to give it so me volume.  I also like to use my hairdryer to give my bangs a little more shape.  I take out the curlers one by one and brush through them into the style I like.  I fi nish it off with a little hairspray and I’m ready to get dressed.

In my bedroom, I look in my closet for a skirt and blouse to match.  The office I work in is pretty casual so I don’t need to wear a suit to work.  On Fridays, we’re allowed to be even more casual so most people wear jeans and sweaters to the office, but no one dares to show up in t-shirts and  shorts.  I put on the skirt and blouse and open the top dresser drawer to get some pantyhose.  I wish I could wear my tennis shoes to work, but I pick out a pair  of heels and put them on.  I was ready to go.

[End of story]

Lucy begins by going "into the bathroom to finish d oing" her "hair."  To do your hair means to make your hair look nice.  We may als o say, "to fix your hair," but the most common expression is "to do your hair."  W ell, if you remember from a previous episode, Lucy had put hot curlers, or hot rollers.  A roller, "roller," is another name for a curler, and those are things tha t women put in their hair so that their hair is not straight, it has curls in it .

Lucy now needs "to finish doing" her "hair."  She s ays that "Before" she "put the hot rollers," or the hot curlers, "in," she "had pu t a little gel in" her "hair to give it some extra volume."  Gel, "gel," is a thick liquid that you put on your hair.

ESL Podcast 34 -  Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

Sometimes you put it on your hair because you want your hair to go in a certain way - you want it to be flat, for example, you put the gel on top.  It's a thick liquid.

When I was in high school, back in the 1950s, it wa s very popular for high school students to have gel - a type of gel in their hair.   Maybe one of the more famous movies in the United States about 1950s and 1960s i n high school was called Grease, "Grease."  And in Grease, which starred, I think, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta - I'm not sure, I, as a man, have not  watched it as much as most American girls and women have - but in the movie, I  remember that the boys had gel - a type of gel on their hair to make it very f lat on their head.

Getting back to Lucy, she says that she "put a litt le gel in" her "hair to give it some" extra "volume."  Volume, "volume," means she made it thicker, or fuller, or bigger.  To add volume to your hair means to make it thicker.

She also likes "to use" her "hair dryer to give" he r "bangs a little more shape." Bangs, "bangs," (always plural) is the hair that is  on the part of your head above your eyes, between your eyes and the top of your he ad.  We call that part of your head your forehead, "forehead."  So, bangs are hair  that goes over your forehead.

Lucy is trying "to give" her "bangs little more sha pe," that is she doesn't want them just flat; she wants to give them a different shape than what they have right now.  So, she takes "out the curlers," meaning she removes the curlers from her hair, "one by one" and brushes her hair into the st yle that she likes.  To brush, "brush," as a verb, means to take something and put  it through your hair so that your hair goes in a certain direction.  The noun br ush, "brush," is the thing that you put in your hair.  We also use the word brush f or someone who is painting. The thing you use to put paint on wall or on a pict ure; that would be also called a brush, a paintbrush.  This is a hairbrush.

Lucy likes to "finish it off," meaning she likes to  finish doing her hair, "with a little hairspray."  Hairspray, "hairspray," (one word) is liquid that you put on a large area.  In order to make the liquid go in a larger a rea, you spray it on, and you spray it by using something called a nozzle.  The b ottle that has the hairspray, on the top has a nozzle, "nozzle," and a nozzle is som ething that takes the liquid and spreads it out - puts it over a wider area.

So, this is hairspray that Lucy is putting on her h ead.  It's a liquid that keeps the hair in the same place so that if you go outside in  the wind, your hair doesn't get, we'd say, messed up.  To mess, "mess," up your hair  means that your hair goes

ESL Podcast 34 -  Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

in a different style or it moves so that it doesn't  look good.  Again, if you don't have hair like me, you don't have to worry about th is!

Lucy goes into her bedroom and looks in her closet for a skirt and a blouse to wear.  A closet, "closet," is a space in your bedro om where you can keep your clothes.  The clothes that you put in a closet are usually ones that you hang, "hang."  To hang your clothes means to put them on something so that the clothes are not folded, they are vertical and they are hanging down from a bar - a pole that is at the top of your closet.  The thing you put your clothes on is called a hanger, "hanger."

So, you put your clothes, or you hang your clothes on a clothes hanger, and you put them into your closet.  Closets can also just b e places to store things - to keep things.  It's like a big box in your room, but  it's very tall, usually as tall as the person or taller.

In Lucy's closet, she's looking for a skirt and a b louse that match.  Remember, to match means the clothes have the similar or same co lors.  A skirt, "skirt," is a piece of clothing that goes around a woman's waist - in the middle of her body - and then it goes down and covers the top of her leg s, or perhaps all of her legs. You can have a long skirt that goes all the way dow n to the bottom of your leg; you could have a short skirt that goes up only cove ring the top of your legs.

Lucy's looking for a skirt and a blouse.  A blouse,  "blouse," is a special kind of shirt that a woman wears.  Usually it is a shirt th at has a collar, "collar," on the top.  A collar is the part of the shirt near the ne ck, and it makes the shirt look a little more formal.  A woman's blouse also usually has buttons in the front so that when you put the blouse on, you put the buttons tog ether to keep the shirt on your body.  We say you fasten the buttons, "fasten. "  You fasten the buttons so that the shirt stays on.  Buttons are little pieces  of plastic or metal that go usually through a hole and that keeps the shirt on.  A men' s formal shirt would also have buttons and a collar; for a woman, we call it a blo use.

Lucy says, "The office" she works "in is pretty cas ual," or very casual.  To be casual, "casual," means to be less formal - to be i nformal - to be more relaxed. Because Lucy works in an office that is casual, she  doesn't "need to wear a suit to work."  A suit "suit," for a woman is a formal p iece, or a formal set of clothing, usually with a blouse, and then you have a jacket o ver the blouse, and then you have a nice skirt or pants that go with the jacket;  this is a suit.  For men, when they wear a suit, usually they have shirt, pants, j acket, and a tie.

ESL Podcast 34 -  Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

Lucy says that "On Fridays," she is "allowed to be even more casual," and many people at her work "wear jeans and sweaters to the office."  To wear means to have on your body.  Jeans, "jeans," are a popular t ype of informal pants. Perhaps the most famous type of jeans are Levi's, a nd they're usually blue, and sometimes black.  Sweaters, "sweaters," are like ve ry warm shirts - shirts that keep you warm.  Often, you put a shirt on and then if you are cold you put a sweater on top of your shirt.

Lucy says, "no one dares to show up in t-shirts and  shorts."  The expression to dare, "dare," to do something means that no one att empts to do that.  The verb, to dare to, means that it is something that you sho uldn't do or it is something that is risky, you could get in trouble.  Your mother ma y say, "Don't you dare go to the movies tonight," she would mean you better not - yo u are not allowed to go to the movie, if you do, you will be in big trouble - you will have a lot of problems from me.

Well, the story says that "no one" at Lucy's work " dares to show up" or to go to work "in t-shirts and shorts."  T-shirts, "t-shirts ," are shirts that you wear that don't have a collar that are very informal.  Shorts, "sho rts," are like pants but they do not go to the bottom of your leg.  They only go and  cover the top of your leg, those would be shorts.

Lucy puts "on a skirt and a blouse and opens the to p dresser drawer to get some pantyhose."  A dresser, "dresser," is a place where  you can keep clothing such as socks, underwear, shirts, perhaps some pants.  You have to fold your clothes up - you have to put the clothes together and put them in the drawer. Remember, in the closet, you hang your clothes ofte n; in a dresser, you put your clothes in a little box, which we call a drawer, "d rawer."  So, a dresser is a piece of furniture that has several drawers, or several b oxes that you can pull out and put clothing into.

Pantyhose, "pantyhose," (one word) is like a combin ation of a pair of pants and a sock.  It's something that women put on.  Usually it goes over their feet and goes all the way up to their waist, and then they put a skirt on so that it covers the top part of their legs.  Again, this is something only worn by a woman.  Pantyhose are usually a color that is brown or a color of you r skin, and they're a more formal type of clothing.  You would use pantyhose for goin g to a business meeting if you were a woman.  If you were a man, you wouldn't wear  pantyhose unless you wanted to look like a woman, but that's a different  story!

ESL Podcast 34 -  Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

Lucy says she wishes she "could wear" her "tennis s hoes to work."  She wishes she could is a conditional construction, "I wish I could."  I wish I could wear my tennis shoes."  Tennis, "tennis," is, you probably know, a sport, but tennis shoes are the kinds of shoes you wear to go running or to  play sports or to walk around your neighborhood, you would put on tennis shoes.

Lucy can't "wear tennis shoes to work," so she has to "pick out," or select, "a pair of heels" to put on.  Heels, "heels," refers here to a pair of shoes that have a little stick at the back of the shoe that makes the woman taller.  We sometimes called these high heels.  So, Lucy puts on a pair of high heels, or a pair of heels, and now she's ready to go to work.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[Start of story]

I go back into the bathroom to finish doing my hair .  Before I put the hot curlers in, I had put a little gel in my hair to give it so me volume.

# Taking Public Transportation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 35: Taking Public Transportation to Work

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 35. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy go to work  by way of public transportation. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I like my job but it takes over an hour to get ther e from my part of town.  First, I walk three blocks to the subway station and swipe m y monthly pass to get through the turnstile.  I wait on the platform for the first express train.  I get on and since it’s so crowded during the morning hours,  there aren’t any seats and I stand, holding onto a handrail.  At my stop, I get off and transfer to a second train that will get me to Union Station.  This one isn’t as crowded and I manage to find a seat.

When the train gets to Union Station, I get off the  train, go up the stairs, and go out of the front exit to the bus stop.  I get on the B bus to downtown and show my bus pass to the bus driver.  I sit down near the fr ont of the bus and when three more people get on board, the driver starts on the route.  When we get close to my stop, I press the button to signal to the driver  that I need to get off and the bus pulls up to the next stop.  I get off and walk half a block to the building where I work.  It’s a long commute, but I look around eve ry morning and I see that I’m not the only one who has to do it.

[End of story]

Public transportation is anything that the governme nt runs or operates, such as buses, trains, and subways.

Lucy says that she likes her job but that "it takes  over an hour to get there from" her "part of town."  To get there means to arrive.  Her part of town is her area of town.  "First," she says, she walks "three blocks to the subway station" and swipes her "monthly pass to get through the turnsti le."  A subway, "subway," (one

ESL Podcast 35 - Taking Public Transportation to Wo rk

word) is a train, usually that goes underneath the ground.  In some cities, such as Chicago, they have an elevated train, which they ca ll the El.  Subways are usually, however, below the ground; they're undergr ound.  In fact, in London, the subway is called the Underground or the Tube.

In this story, Lucy walks to the subway station.  A  station, "station," is a place where you can get on and off the subway; that's cal led a subway station.  To get into the subway station, Lucy swipes her monthly pa ss.  To swipe, "swipe," means to take a card, such as a credit card, and to  put it through a machine very quickly so that the machine can read or understand the information on the card.

In the subway system, Lucy has a monthly pass, "pas s."  A pass is like a ticket; it's a ticket for an entire month - for thirty days .  So, she swipes the card through the card reader, we would call it, and that card is  her monthly pass.

After she swipes her monthly pass, she can walk thr ough the turnstile.  The turnstile, "turnstile," (one word) is a machine tha t prevents you from walking through somewhere.  It has a bar and after you pay,  you can then push the bar and the bar will move forward - the bar is just a p iece of metal - and then, the next person has to pay and they can push through wi th the turnstile.  One person goes through at a time, and you'll find turnstiles at subway stations, sometimes at train stations.  If you don't have any money, you can just jump over the turnstile. I would not recommend that, however, because they m ight arrest you if you don't pay!

Lucy says she waits "on the platform for the first express train."  The platform, "platform," (one word) is the place where you wait for the train or the subway to stop, and then the doors open and you walk onto the  train.  The platform is the place where you wait right next to the tracks, "tra cks."  The tracks are what the trains go on.

Lucy is at the platform and she's waiting "for the first express train."  Express, "express," here means the train that makes the fewe st number of stops.  Express trains, such as in New York, will only stop at some  of the subway stations, not at all of them.  If you want a subway train that stops  at all the stations, you would get what we would call a local train.  This is true  especially in New York City; if you look at their map of the subway, you will see t hat some subway trains are express, meaning they make fewer stops - they don't  stop at every subway station - and some are local.

ESL Podcast 35 - Taking Public Transportation to Wo rk

Lucy gets "on and since it’s so crowded," or becaus e there are so many people there, "there aren’t any seats" and so she has to s tand, and she stands by "holding onto a handrail," "handrail," (one word).  A handrail is a piece of metal that is in a subway train that you can grab onto.  You can hold your hand around this piece of metal so that you don't fall when the  train goes forward and stops; this is called a handrail because it's where you pu t your hand.  Of course, you could also put your hand on the person next to you,  but they may not like that, so use the handrail!

Lucy says that at her stop, or the place where she leaves the train - leaves the subway - she gets off, or exits, and transfers "to a second train."  To transfer, "transfer," as a verb, means to go from one train to another or from one bus to another.  Your train may not go all the way where y ou want to go, so you may need to transfer to a different train.

Lucy says that she needs to take a second train in order to get to her final destination, which is Union Station.  Union Station  is a train station in downtown Los Angeles.  This train, Lucy says, "isn't as crow ded" - there aren't as many people - it "isn't as crowded" and she manages "to find a seat" - she is able to find a seat.

"When the train gets to Union Station," Lucy gets o ff, or exits - leaves "the train, goes up the stairs" - walks up the stairs - and goe s out "the front exit to the bus stop."  The front exit, "exit," as a noun, means the door where you leave.  You can also use exit as a verb to mean to leave.

Lucy walks out "the front exit to the bus stop."  T he bus stop is the place where, you can guess, the bus stops to pick up people and to drop them off, or to leave them.  The bus stop is like the subway station, but  we don't call it the bus station; we call it the bus stop.  There is actually an expr ession, the bus station, but that's a place where you take a bus to another city; that would be a bus station. Usually there's only one or two of those.  A bus st op is anywhere or anyplace where the bus stops to let people on the bus and le t people off the bus.

Lucy gets "on the B" - the letter "B" - "bus to dow ntown and" shows her "bus pass to the bus driver."  Your bus pass is like your sub way pass.  In this case, you show the pass to the driver; the driver looks at the pass to see that it is a good pass.  Lucy then sits "down near the front of the b us and three more people get on board."  On board, "board," means to be on a tra in, or a plane, or a bus, or a ship.  You may say, "I need to get on board my plan e," that means you need to get onto your plane - you need to go into your plan e.

ESL Podcast 35 - Taking Public Transportation to Wo rk

 Here, Lucy talks about three people getting on boar d, or coming onto and sitting in the bus.  After "three more people get on board, " or get on the bus, "the driver starts on the route."  The route, "route," sometime s called the route (pronounced "root"), both pronunciations are possible, is the p ath or the direction that the bus goes.  It goes down Main Street, then goes on First  Street, then goes down Central Avenue, then takes a left on Seventh Street , and comes back on Waterview Drive.  That would be a route, the street s where the bus goes.  In general, a route is a list of the streets or freewa ys or roads that you take to get somewhere.

Lucy says when she gets close to her stop, she pres ses "the button to signal to the driver that" she needs "to get off."  To signal , "signal," means to indicate - to tell the driver that she needs to get off.  In many  American buses, there's a button or sometimes there's a string that you pull, and it  makes a noise in the front of the bus, and that allows the bus driver to know that yo u want to get off.  It tells the bus driver that you want to get off at the next sto p.  You can also ask the driver, "Can I get off at the next stop?"  Remember, a stop  is anywhere the bus goes to pick up or let out people.

Well, Lucy signals to the driver that she needs to get off at the next stop, and "the bus pulls up to the next stop."  To pull up (two wo rds) means to dive up - to go to. We use that verb especially when we are talking abo ut cars or buses.  Your car can pull up to the house; that means it drives up to the street where your house is and it stops.  The idea of pulling up usually me ans go forward and then stop.

Lucy gets off, or leaves the bus, and walks a "half  a block to the building where" she works.  A block, "block," is the area between t wo streets.  In most American cities, the blocks are square, so you have two stre ets on both sides and that whole thing is called a block.  The block that I li ve on is not square; it's a very strange, unusual shape, but most cities have blocks  that are square.  We also use that expression when we are talking about dista nce.  Someone may say, "How many blocks is it to the train station?"  You could say, "It is four blocks from here," meaning you have to walk four streets to get  there.

Lucy says that she has "a long commute, but" she lo oks "around every morning" - she looks at the other people - and she sees that  she is "not the only one who has to do it," meaning there are many people who ha ve to commute a long distance.  Some companies now allow their employees  to telecommute. Telecommute, "telecommute," (one word) means that y ou work at home but you call the office to talk to people.

 Now let's listen to the episode, this time at a nor mal speed.

I wait on the platform for the first express train.  I get on and since it’s so crowded during the morning hours,  there aren’t any seats and I stand, holding onto a handrail.

# At My Desk

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 36: At My Desk and at Lunch

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 36. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy working at  her desk and go out to lunch with her supervisor. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I get to the office and sit down at my desk.  I sha re a cubicle with another employee, Jim, but he only works in the afternoons so we don’t usually get in each other’s way too much.  I boot up my computer a nd look at my agenda for today.  I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I  decide not to read them right away.  There were some new inter-office paperwork i n my inbox too, but I decide to look at them a little later.  First, I wanted to  start in on a report that I had to finish today.  I had a conference call at the end of the day with the head office, but I had most of the day to get it done.

Before long, it was the lunch hour.  I didn’t pack a lunch so I ask my supervisor if she wanted to have lunch together.  We head down the street to a sit-down restaurant.  The hostess shows us to a table in the  back of the restaurant.  The waiter arrives a few minutes later and we order ent rees, no appetizers, since we need to get back by 1:00.  The waiter was very busy  so I had to wave him down to get the check.  He brought the bill, and my supe rvisor and I split the check. We walk back to the office and I get back to work.  Just four more hours until quitting time!

[End of story]

When we say we are at our desk, we mean we are sitt ing next to or by our desk.

Lucy gets to the office and sits down at her desk.  She shares "a cubicle with another employee."  A cubicle, "cubicle," is a smal l space in a big office where you have walls that divide the different employees.   They don't have a separate office; they don't usually have a door, but they do  have walls - three walls around them so they have some privacy - they have some qui et to work.  But, the

ESL Podcast 36 - At My Desk and at Lunch

cubicles are in a larger office, so it's like a sma ll part of an office that one person can work at or two people can work at.

In the Lucy's case, she shares her cubicle with som eone else, "but he only works in the afternoons so" they "don't usually get in ea ch other's way too much."  To get in someone else's way means that you are interf ering with each other - you are causing problems for each other.

Lucy says that she boots up her computer and looks at her agenda for the day. To boot, "boot," up (two words) means to start your  computer - to turn your computer on.  Your agenda, "agenda," is a list of t hings - a schedule of things that you need to do today: appointments, phone call s, and so forth; all of these would be part of your agenda.

Lucy says that she "had about 30 new emails in" her  "inbox."  Your inbox, "inbox," is in your email program, and that is the place where you find the messages that people have sent you.  You can also h ave a inbox where you put papers that you have to work on.  The opposite of the inbox would be the out box.

Lucy says that there are "some new inter-office pap erwork in" her "inbox too." Inter-office, "inter-office," means between offices .  Inter means between two different offices.  So, inter-office paperwork woul d be things, letters, memos, other business forms that you would give to another  office in your company.  If you are in the accounting department, you take care  of the money; you might send information to the sales department; that woul d be inter-office paperwork.

Paperwork, "paperwork," (one word) just refers to a ny form, letter, memo, anything on paper that is related to your business.   Sometimes people use this expression, paperwork, to describe unnecessary form s or paper forms that you have to complete that cause a lot of problems - tha t take a lot of time.  Someone may say, "There's too much paperwork to get a visa to the United States" - a lot of paperwork.

There's a joke in offices about putting paperwork i n the circular file.  A file, "file," is usually a place where you put business documents  that are related to each other.  Circular, "circular," means round.  The exp ression, circular file, refers to a wastebasket or a trash basket, a place where you wo uld get rid of something - throw something away.  So, someone may say, "Well, I'm going to put this in my circular file," that is I'm going to throw it away.   Of course, it's not really a file.  If it were a file, you would keep it in a filing cabinet.   I worked at a job, many years

ESL Podcast 36 - At My Desk and at Lunch

ago, where I had a small cubicle and we had lots of  paperwork.  Many times, we would joke about putting some of the sales paperwor k into the circular file because it was more work for us to have to read it.

Lucy says that she "wanted to start in on a report that" she "had to finish today." To start in (two words) means to begin - to begin w orking on something - to start something.  "I want to start in on the report" - I want to begin working on the report.  We often use this verb when we are talking  about a big project or a project that is going to take a lot of time.

Lucy says that she has "a conference call at the en d of the day with the head office."  A conference call, "conference," call is when you have three or more people talking on the telephone together at the sam e time.  You can have a conference call of three, four, ten, perhaps even m ore people, although it is difficult to hear everyone if you have more than fi ve or six people talking.  A conference call is a way that businesses save money , of course, so they can have a meeting without actually having to leave you r office.  To me, that is the best meeting, when I don't actually have to go to it.

Lucy says that she has "a conference call at the en d of the day," meaning during the last part of the day, "with the head office."  The head office is the main office. It's the headquarters for your company.  It's the m ost important office, the biggest office, usually.  She does not work at the head off ice, we can guess, she probably works at what we would call a branch of the company, "branch," a branch.  The word branch is the same word we use for a tree - the different parts of the tree - the arms of the tree we call the bran ches.  They're smaller parts of the bigger tree.  This is a branch office; it's a s maller office, part of a larger company.

Lucy says that "Before long, it was the lunch hour. "  Before long means very soon afterwards.  "Before long, it was the lunch ho ur," and the lunch hour is the time that you eat your middle of the day meal - you r lunch.  Some companies have a thirty minute lunch hour.  Some companies ha ve an hour lunch hour. Some companies don't have a set lunch hour for the more important bosses, they may go on a long lunch, especially if it is a meeti ng - a business lunch we would call it.

In Lucy's story, she says that she "didn't pack a l unch," so she asks her "supervisor if she wanted to" go with her to lunch.   To pack, "pack," a lunch means to make food at home, put it in a bag or a sm all box, and bring it to work; that's packing a lunch.  Lucy says that she asked h er "supervisor if she wanted to

ESL Podcast 36 - At My Desk and at Lunch

have lunch together."  A supervisor, "supervisor," is another name for your boss - the person who tells you what to do.  In my life, t hat would be my wife!

Lucy says that she and her supervisor "head down the street to a sit-down restaurant."  To head, "head," somewhere means to g o somewhere or to go in the direction of something.  To "head down the stre et" just means to go down or to walk, in this case, on "the street to a sit-down  restaurant," a restaurant where you can have a more formal meal.

"The hostess shows" them "to a table in the back of  the restaurant."  A hostess, "hostess," is the woman, in this case, in a restaur ant that says hello to you when you come in the restaurant - that greets you, and s he asks how many people are in your party, meaning how big is your group - how many people are in your group, and then she takes you to a table.  The male  version of this would be a host, "host."  So, a hostess is always a woman and host is a man.

In very expensive restaurants - in what we would ca ll fancy restaurants, restaurants where you have to dress very nicely and  you pay a lot of money for your food, they sometimes have what's called the ma itre d', a maitre d', which is the person that takes reservations and shows you to  your table.

In this story, the hostess shows Lucy and her super visor "to a table."  To show someone to a table means to take them to a table.  When I go into a restaurant, sometimes they look at me and they show me the door , meaning they take me to the door and say, "Goodbye, we don't want you in ou r restaurant."  Happens to me all the time, I'm not sure why.

"The waiter arrives" at their table "a few minutes later" and Lucy and her boss "order entrees," not "appetizers."  An entree, "ent ree," is the main part of your meal, what we would call the main course, "course."   Your meal has different parts.  There's the main course, which is the entre e, that's the biggest part of the meal where you would get, for example, chicken or s teak or the largest part of the food you are eating.  An appetizer, "appetizer, " is something you eat at the beginning of the meal, usually it's a smaller porti on of food.  Perhaps you would have some vegetables, or in many restaurants, they have appetizers that are fried food - food that you put in oil to make them brown.  These are appetizers; they are things that you eat before your entree - y our main meal.

Lucy and her boss "need to get back" or to return " by 1:00," so they do not have time to have an appetizer.  After they finished the ir meal, Lucy waved down the waiter.  She says "The waiter was very busy so I ha d to wave him down."  To

ESL Podcast 36 - At My Desk and at Lunch

wave, "wave," someone down means that you put your hand up in the air or you say something to tell the person that you want him to come over to you.  To wave someone down could also be used, for example, if yo u had problems with your car.  Your car stopped working, we would say it bro ke down, and you park on the side of the road and you try to wave someone down to help you.  You wave your arm - you move your arm back and forth to get someo ne's attention.

The waiter "brought the bill," and Lucy and her sup ervisor "split the check."  To split, "split," is the same as divide.  The check, of course, is the bill - how much money you owe.  So, to split the check means to div ide the check; each person pays for the food that they ate.

Lucy and her supervisor walk back to their office.  Lucy says, "Just four more hours until quitting time!"  Quitting time is the t ime that you stop working.  We're going to stop talking and now listen to the story a t a normal speed.

[Start of story]

I get to the office and sit down at my desk.  I sha re a cubicle with another employee, Jim, but he only works in the afternoons so we don’t usually get in each other’s way too much.  I boot up my computer a nd look at my agenda for today.  I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I  decide not to read them right away.

# Bank and Market

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 37: The Bank and The Market

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 37. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy as she run s errands at the bank and at the market. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I left at work at exactly five o’clock because I wa nted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30.  Fortunately, it’s on the  way to the bus stop.  I get to the bank and I stand in line.  I fill out a deposit env elope and sign the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn.  When I get to the f ront of the line, I hand the teller the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how mu ch I had in my account.  She told me my balance and handed me my receipt.

I ride the bus and the subway home.  I realize that  I need a few things at the market and stop at one on the way there.  I pick up  a cart as soon as I walk in and go to the produce department to load up on frui t, some apples and bananas. I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they  have.  I’m feeling lazy and I don’t want to cook tonight.  I pick up a sandwich a nd I head for the checkout stands.  I get into the shortest line and the cashi er rings me up.  She gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags.  I walk the two blocks to my apartment and I’m ready for a relaxing evening at h ome.

[End of story]

The title of this episode is "The Bank and The Mark et."

Lucy says she left "work at exactly five o’clock," we might also say precisely at five o'clock - not 5:01, not 4:59, but five o'clock .  Another way of expressing that is five o'clock on the dot, "dot."  On the dot mean s the same as exactly at that time.

So, Lucy leaves her work at "five o'clock because,"  she says, she wants "to make it to the bank before it closes at 5:30."  To make it, here, means to arrive at the

ESL Podcast 37 - The Bank and The Market

bank.  "I want to make it on time" - I want to be there on time.  She wants "to make it to the bank before it closes."  The bank wh ere you keep your money, and you are able to get money from the bank.

"Fortunately," Lucy says, the bank is "on the way to the bus stop."  On the way means it is between her work and the bus stop - it is convenient for her.  When we say something is on the way, we mean that it is between where you are now and where you are going.

Lucy says she gets "to the bank" and stands "in lin e."  To stand in line means to wait in a line until it is your turn - until it is your time to talk to the person at the bank.  So, Lucy is standing in line or waiting in l ine.  I remember when I was young, I come from a big family and it was so big y ou had to stand in line to get food every day, and if you were last in line, you m ay not eat that day.  So, you have to be careful when you come from a big family!

Lucy says that she filled "out a deposit envelope" and signed "the back of" her "paycheck."  To fill out means to complete.  A depo sit envelope, "deposit," is an envelope that you use to put money into your accoun t.  It is also a verb, to deposit, which means to put something into somethin g else; usually we are talking about money.  The opposite of deposit would  be withdrawal.  A withdrawal, "withdrawal," is when you take money ou t of your bank, and the verb is to withdraw.  We sometimes use that verb, to wit hdraw, also when, for example, a political candidate decides that they are not going to try to win an election.  They can withdraw from the election - th ey can leave the election.

Lucy signs "the back of" her "paycheck."  A paychec k, "paycheck," is a check that your company gives you that's your money that you g et for working at the company.  Paychecks are not as common as they were even five or ten years ago in the US.  Most companies don't give you a phy sical paycheck - a piece of paper.  Instead, they put the money electronically into your bank account.  They make what we would call an electronic funds transfe r.  Electronic funds, "funds," transfer.  Funds is just another word for money, an d to transfer means to move something from one place to another.

Lucy is waiting her turn in line.  Her turn, "turn, " as we mentioned before, is her opportunity when she can talk to someone.  Someone may say to you, "Wait your turn," they mean they are talking to someone else a nd they will talk to you after they finish talking to the other people.

ESL Podcast 37 - The Bank and The Market

When Lucy gets "to the front of the line" - to the beginning of the line - she hands "the teller" her "envelope."  To hand, "hand," mean s to give something to someone with your hand.  The teller, "teller," is the name of the person who works at the bank who takes your money and gives yo u money from your bank account.  We call that person the teller.

Lucy gives the teller her envelope and asks if the teller could tell her how much money she had in her account.  An account, "account ," is the money that you keep with the bank, in this case.  An account can a lso be a relationship or an agreement you have with another company.  Sometimes  in business, we talk about salespeople having different accounts.  That' s the same as different clients or different people that they sell things to - they  have a relationship with them.

In this case, Lucy finds out her balance and gets h er receipt.  The teller told Lucy her balance, "balance."  Your balance is how much m oney you have in your bank account.  To hand her, we already know, means to gi ve her her receipt.  Receipt, "receipt," is a piece of paper that says that I am giving you this much money or this is how much money you put into your account.  It's so that you can show or prove, if necessary, that you put the money into yo ur account.

Lucy decides to take "the bus and the subway home."   She realizes that she needs to get "a few things" - some things - "at the  market."  The market, "market," is another word for a store, usually a st ore that sells food.  We would also call that a grocery store.  Lucy stops at the grocery store - she goes to the grocery store - on her way home.  The store is betw een her subway station and her apartment.

She picks up, or gets, a cart, "cart."  A cart is l ike a small basket or box that you put your food into when you are shopping at the sup ermarket or at the market. She walks in and goes "to the produce department."  Produce, "produce," is the word we use in, a supermarket or a grocery store, to refer to the fruits and vegetables; we call that the produce.  A department  is just a part of a store.  So, you would have in a big supermarket a produce depar tment, maybe a bakery, meat department, a fish department perhaps.  These are different parts of the store.

Lucy goes "to the produce department to load up on fruit."  To load up, "load," up (two words) means to get a lot of.  "I'm going to l oad up on fruit" - I'm going to get a lot of fruit.  She gets "some apples and bananas. "  She looks "around to see what kind of cooked foods" the market has.  Cooked,  "cooked," food is food that is already prepared.  In American markets, many of them sell food that is already

ESL Podcast 37 - The Bank and The Market

ready to eat.  You can just take it home and eat it ; the food is already cooked. Could be chicken; it could be other meat; it could be soup.  These are all things you can buy in many big markets - many supermarkets .

Lucy says that today she is "feeling lazy."  She do esn't want to work very hard, just like me!  She's "feeling lazy" and she does no t "want to cook tonight." Instead, she picks up, or gets, "a sandwich" and he ads "for the checkout stands." So, she's going to buy a sandwich, and after she ge ts it, she heads for, or she goes toward, "the checkout stands."  The checkout s tands are places where you pay for the food that you want to buy.  The verb to  checkout, "checkout," means to buy something at a store.  Usually, when you go get what you want, and then you go to one place to pay for it.  A stand is just  another word for a place to pay for something or a place that sells something.

Lucy gets "into the shortest line and the cashier r ings up" her sale - she rings her up.  Of course, you want to get in the shortest lin e, but normally, most people are in the longest line.  That's why it is the longest line, because there are more people in it.  Think about that one!

Lucy is lucky and she gets in "the shortest line an d the cashier," "cashier," rings her up.  A cashier is the person that takes your mo ney - that takes your cash, or your credit card, or a check.  To ring, "ring," som eone up means to take their money.  When you are at a store and someone wants to buy something, the person figures out or calculates how much money you  need to give them and they take your money.  That is ringing you up.

Lucy gets her change from the cashier.  Her change,  "change," is the money back that you get when you give a cashier cash.  So , if you buy something for 15 dollars, and you give the cashier 20 dollars, your change is five dollars.  You see, I studied math when I was in school!

Lucy says that her bagger handed her her bags.  A b agger, "bagger," is a person in a grocery store or a supermarket that puts the f ood into a bag.  In most grocery stores, at least in California, they have baggers to help you.  In some stores, they don't, however.  You have to put your own food into  a bag.

Lucy walks "two blocks to" her "apartment," and say s she is "ready for a relaxing evening at home."

Now let's relax and listen to the story at a normal  speed.

ESL Podcast 37 - The Bank and The Market

 [Start of story]

I left at work at exactly five o’clock because I wa nted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30.  Fortunately, it’s on the  way to the bus stop.  I get to the bank and I stand in line.  I fill out a deposit env elope and sign the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn.  When I get to the f ront of the line, I hand the teller the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how mu ch I had in my account.  She told me my balance and handed me my receipt.

I ride the bus and the subway home.  I realize that  I need a few things at the market and stop at one on the way there.  I pick up  a cart as soon as I walk in and go to the produce department to load up on frui t, some apples and bananas. I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they  have.  I’m feeling lazy and I don’t want to cook tonight.  I pick up a sandwich a nd I head for the checkout stands.  I get into the shortest line and the cashi er rings me up.  She gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags.  I walk the two blocks to my apartment and I’m ready for a relaxing evening at h ome.

# Dinner and Making Dessert

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 38: Dinner and Making Dessert

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 38. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy eat dinner  and make cookies for dessert. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

When I get home, I change into my casual clothes an d head for the kitchen.  I grab my sandwich, a napkin, and sit down at the din ing room table to eat.  For my birthday last year, my brother gave me some place mats that have maps of the United States on them.  I have always been bad at geography so he thought he would be funny and give me something to study wh ile I ate.  Of course, I haven’t learned a thing!

I am still hungry after the sandwich and want some dessert.  I preheat the oven and then take a package of ready-made cookies out of the fridge that just needed to be baked.  I get out a cookie sheet and put some  aluminum foil on it.  I always do this when I bake because this way, I don’t have to do any dishes afterwards.  I could just throw away the foil.  Then, I shape the dough into circles, put them on the cookie sheet, and put the pan into the oven.

After 15 minutes, I put on my oven mitts and take the pan out.  The cookies smell great, but first, I need to let them cool.  After 3 0 minutes, I put three of them on a plate and the rest of them in a Tupperware containe r.  I’ll take those to work tomorrow.  That should make the day go by a little faster.

[End of story]

So, we get to eat in this episode, and that's good because I am hungry!

When Lucy gets home - when she arrives home - she c hanges into her "casual clothes."  To change, "change," into is a verb that  means to take your clothes off that you have on you right now, and put on differen t clothes.  Someone may say,

ESL Podcast 38 - Dinner and Making Dessert

"I need to go change," they mean I need to change m y clothing, or to change into different clothing.

Lucy changes into her "casual clothes" and heads fo r, or goes toward, "the kitchen."  She grabs her sandwich, meaning she pick s it up with her hand; she also grabs a napkin.  A napkin, "napkin," is a smal l towel that you use to wipe your face when you are eating, and to put on the to p of your legs, what we would call your lap, "lap," so that if any food falls dow n, it doesn't get your clothes dirty. Of course, you can eat very carefully to prevent th at from happening as well. But, if you don't eat carefully, then a napkin is a  good idea.

Lucy sits down at her "dining room table to eat."  The dining room, "dining," room (two words) is the place in your house where you ea t.  To dine, "dine," is to eat.

Lucy says for her "birthday last year," her "brothe r gave" her "some place mats that have maps of the United States on them."  A pl ace mat, "place mat," is a piece of plastic or paper, it could also be a piece  of cloth - material - that you put underneath your plate - each plate on the table so that the table does not get dirty.  These place mats "have maps of the United S tates on them."  Lucy says that she has "always been bad at geography."  To be  bad, "bad," at something means that you are not very good at it.  You could say, "I'm very bad at tennis," that means I don't play tennis very well.  Or, "I'm  very bad at dating.  Whenever I meet a girl, she hates me after the first date," th at's the story of my life!

Well, Lucy is not bad at dating, I don't think; she  is "bad at geography." Geography, "geography," is the study of where thing s are - the location of things. It's more than that, but that's what she means here .  So, Lucy's "bad at geography," and because of that, her brother "thoug ht he would be funny" to give her "something to study while" she eats.  "He thoug ht he would be funny," meaning he was trying to make a joke - trying to be  funny.  "Of course," Lucy says, "I haven't learned a thing," meaning I haven' t learned anything or I have learned nothing.  All of those mean the same - "I h aven't learned a thing."

Lucy says that she's "still hungry after" eating he r sandwich and wants "some dessert."  Dessert, "dessert," is usually something  sweet with sugar, for example, that you eat at the end of your meal.  It's what we  would call your last course. After your appetizer and an entree, you can have de ssert.  It's my favorite part of the meal.

Lucy preheats her oven and then takes out "a packag e of ready-made cookies." To preheat, "preheat," means to heat, in this case,  the oven to get it ready to

ESL Podcast 38 - Dinner and Making Dessert

cook something.  An oven, "oven," is a place where you put food into it and you close the door, we would call the oven door, so tha t the food inside will cook. Usually, we use the verb bake, "bake," when we are using an oven.  So, we cook the food, or we bake the food in the oven.

Lucy is going to bake a package of cookies - "of re ady-made cookies."  A package is just the container - the bag or the box where the cookies are kept. When Lucy says the cookies are ready-made, "ready-m ade," she means that she doesn't have to prepare them by herself.  She doesn 't have to get out eggs and water and flour, and make the cookies herself.  Ins tead, she just has to take the cookie out of the package and put it on the pan and  put it in the oven and it will cook.

If you make something by taking all of the, what we  would call, ingredients or the things that you use to cook your food, we would say  you were cooking from scratch, "scratch."  To cook something from scratch  means that you make the entire thing yourself.

Well, Lucy is not making cookies from scratch; she' s using ready-made cookies, which she takes out of her "fridge that just need to be baked, that is they just need to be put into the oven and they will cook.  S he puts the cookies on a cookie sheet.  A cookie sheet, "sheet," is a long, flat pan that you can use to put things on when you put them in the oven.  We use th at term, cookie sheet, even when we are not using it to bake cookies.  You can put chicken on a cookie sheet and put it in your oven; we still call it your cook ie sheet.

Lucy puts some aluminum foil on her cookie sheet.  Aluminum, "aluminum," is a kind of metal.  Foil, "foil," is a metal sheet - a very thin sheet of aluminum. Sometimes people just say foil instead of aluminum foil; they mean the same thing.  It's like a sheet of paper but it is made of metal, and you can use it to wrap things in - to put things in.  Here, Lucy is using it to keep the cookie sheet clean - to protect the cookie sheet.  She says she does this because after she finishes baking her cookies, she doesn't have to wash any di shes or "to do any dishes." So, the aluminum foil protects the sheet, and so the cookie sheet doesn't get dirty - the pan doesn't get dirty.  That's why she uses the aluminum foil; she doesn't have to wash, or do, any dishes.  She just throws the foil away.

After she puts the foil on the cookie sheet, she sh apes "the dough into circles." The dough, "dough," is a thick material - a thick s ubstance that we use to make cookies.  We also use that word, dough, when we are  talking about pancakes or waffles, types of food that you would eat in the mo rning.  Whenever you have

ESL Podcast 38 - Dinner and Making Dessert

something that you bake, such as bread or cookies, it begins with cookie dough. That's the cookie before it is baked.

Lucy says she shapes the dough.  To shape, "shape,"  means to change something - to take something and to make it look d ifferent.  Here, Lucy is shaping "the dough into circles" - into round cooki es.  She puts "them on the cookie sheet," and then she puts "the pan" - the co okie sheet in "the oven."

"After about 15 minutes," Lucy puts on her "oven mi tts" and takes "the pan out." An oven mitt, "mitt," is like a glove.  It is a ver y thick piece of material, sometimes like a thick towel that you can use to pick up some thing that is very hot.  You don't want to burn your hands, so you put on oven m itts.

We also use that word, mitts, when talking about gl oves that you wear that don't have a separate space for each finger.  A glove, te chnically, is something you put over your hand, and each finger you can move separa tely.  With a mitt, you put your hand in and you can move your thumb, but the f our fingers are all together inside the mitt.  Well, this is a oven mitt, used to take hot things out of the oven.

Lucy says that "The cookies smell great," meaning they smell very good, "but first," she needs "to let them cool."  To cool, "co ol," is a verb, which means to lower the temperature.  Something is hot needs to c ool before you eat it.

"After 30 minutes," Lucy puts three cookies "on a p late" and puts "the rest of them" - the remaining cookies - "in a Tupperware co ntainer."  Tupperware, "Tupperware," is a company that makes small plastic  boxes - small plastic containers that you can put food into.  Tupperware is a name of a company, so you have to use a capital T, "Tupperware."  Even th ough you buy a plastic container that is not made by this company, people still call them Tupperware containers, or sometimes just Tupperware.  If someo ne says, "I need to buy some new Tupperware," they mean they need to buy so me new plastic containers for food.

Lucy says she's going to take her cookies "to work tomorrow.  That should make the day go by a little faster."  When we say the da y will go by, "by," we mean that it will seem like the day is not very long - that t ime is moving very fast.  Just like when you are listening to ESLPod.com courses, the d ay goes by much faster.

Speaking of faster, now let's listen to the story a t a native rate of speech.

# Cleaning and Relaxing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 39: Cleaning and Relaxing

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 39. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy clean up a round the house and then relax. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I am feeling pretty energetic when I finish my thre e cookies and decide to do a little cleaning.  I take out a rag and start dustin g the living room.  I dust the TV and the lamps.  I wipe the coffee table, too.  The rug looked filthy so I get out the vacuum and vacuum it.  I pick up around the room an d put things away.  The bathroom needs cleaning, too, but by this time, I a m starting to feel tired. Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub wi ll have to wait for another day.

I turn on the TV to watch the newscast, but I misse d the national news.  I flip though the channels but all I see are commercials.  My favorite reality show doesn’t come on for another hour so I turn off the TV.  I put down the remote, and pick up a magazine.  I thumb through it for few min utes and then the phone rings. It’s my best friend Marlene, so I put down the maga zine and spend the half hour chatting with her.  There’s nothing like a good tal k with a good friend to end a busy day.

[End of story]

Lucy starts by saying that she's "feeling pretty en ergetic," or very energetic. Energetic, "energetic," comes from the word energy,  "energy."  Energy is the same as power.  When we say someone is energetic, u sually we mean that they have a lot of willingness to do something - they ha ve a lot of energy.  We also use that expression, she has a lot of energy; that means she has a lot of strength to do things - she doesn't get tired very easily.  It's the opposite of being tired.  It's to be energetic, like the host of ESLPod.com's cour ses, very energetic!

ESL Podcast 39 - Cleaning and Relaxing

"When I finish my three cookies," Lucy says, that i s, when I finish eating my three cookies, I "decide to do a little cleaning," she sa ys.  So, Lucy takes "out a rag" and starts "dusting the living room."  A rag, "rag, " or a rag, depends on what part of the country you are from, in my part of the coun try, we say rag, "I take out a rag and start dusting the living room."  A rag is a  small towel; usually it's a small towel you use for cleaning.  To dust, "dust," means  to take a rag or a small towel and remove the little bits of dirt, what we call du st, off of a table or television or other furniture.  Dust can be both a noun as well a s a verb.  As a noun, it's the little dirt - pieces of dirt.  As a verb, it means to remove those pieces of dirt.

Lucy says that she dusts "the TV and the lamps."  S he wipes "the coffee table, too."  To wipe, "wipe," is similar to dust.  It mea ns taking a rag or a towel and cleaning something up.  The difference is that dust ing is only used when we are talking about these little pieces of dirt that you find after a few days in your house.  When you say I'm going to wipe something, h owever, usually that means there's some water or some other dirt - something b igger than just little pieces of dust.  So Lucy says she will "wipe the coffee table " also.

"The rug" that Lucy has looks "filthy."  Filthy, "f ilthy," is another word for dirty.  So, the rug on the floor looks dirty, so she gets "out the vacuum" and vacuums it. The vacuum, "vacuum," is a machine that removes dir t from the floor - from carpet or rugs - by sucking the dirt out.  Vacuum can also be a verb, so when you say, "I'm going to vacuum my rugs," you mean you're  going to use a vacuum to clean your rugs.

Lucy picks "up around the room and puts things away ."  To pick up can mean to take with your hand and grab something and lift it,  but in this case, to pick up means that Lucy is going around and putting things where they belong - taking the newspaper out and throwing in away or making su re that the table looks nice, that it's been dusted.  This is to pick up - to tak e things that don't belong in the room and move them somewhere else.  When you move them somewhere else, we say that you are putting them away.  So, to put something away means to put it where it belongs.  Often, this means putting it in a closet or somewhere where you store it or keep it so that people can't see it .  So, Lucy picks "up around the room and puts things" that don't belong there - tha t should not be there - "away."

"The bathroom needs cleaning" as well, Lucy says.  Lucy sure does have a dirty apartment!  "The bathroom needs cleaning" also, "bu t by this time," she says, "I'm starting to feel tired.  Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub will have to wait for another day."  Mopping comes from the verb to mop, "mop."  A mop is both a noun and a verb.  As a noun, it is the thing you use to clean floors

ESL Podcast 39 - Cleaning and Relaxing

with water and soap.  It looks a little like a broo m.  A broom, "broom," is what you use to clean dust and dirt off the floor.  A mop is  what you use with water to clean a floor.  So, the floor would not have a carpet or not have a rug on it, it would just be wood or linoleum or some other material.

Well, in the story Lucy says that she needs to mop her bathroom and to scrub her tub.  Scrub, "scrub" is a verb, which means to clean something by using a lot of energy - by using a lot of force.  Taking a towe l, for example, and rubbing it back and forth several times; that would be to scru b something.  Lucy says that she's too tired, so that the mopping and the scrubb ing "will have to wait for another day."  Or, if this were my house, it would be another year!

Lucy turns on the television "to watch the newscast ."  A newscast, "newscast," is the same as a news program or a television news sho w that you will watch usually either on your television, although you cou ld have a newscast on the radio as well, or on a podcast.

Lucy says that she was too late to watch the nation al news; she "missed the national news."  The national news, of course, woul d be news about the whole country, not just about your particular area.  If it is news just about your city, we would call that local news.

Lucy flips "through the channels but all" she sees "are commercials."  The channels, "channels," are the stations on the telev ision.  If you have a cable television, you may have 100, 150, 200 channels - 2 00 different television stations you can watch.  In this case, Lucy is flip ping through the channels.  To flip, "flip," through the channels means to go from  one channel to another, usually somewhat quickly.  You want to see what programs are on the television right now, so you flip through the channels.  Unfortunate ly, all Lucy sees "are commercials."  Commercials are just advertisements.   These are things that you see on television that try to get you, usually, to buy something.

"My favorite reality show," Lucy says, "doesn’t com e on for another hour."  A reality, "reality," show, "show," is a television p rogram that does not have professional actors or actresses; it is a show wher e there is a contest between people or groups of people.  Lucy says her show "do esn't come on," or isn't going to be on the television, "for another hour" s o she turns the television off.

She puts "down the remote."  The remote, "remote," is the same as the remote control, and that's the little thing you use to cha nge channels - to flip through the channels, means the same thing, to change channels - to flip through.  It's also

ESL Podcast 39 - Cleaning and Relaxing

what you use to increase the volume - make it loude r - or decrease the volume - make it quieter.  This is called a remote control.  Sometimes we just call it a remote.  In my house, for example, if I'm watching television, I have to have the remote control.  If my wife has the remote, it driv es me crazy!

Back to Lucy, Lucy says that she picks "up a magazi ne" and she thumbs "through it."  To thumb through, "thumb" through (t wo words) means to look at a magazine or a newspaper, but you're not looking at it very closely.  It's sort of like flipping through the channels.  You're flipping thr ough, or thumbing through, the magazine to see what stories are in it or what pict ures are in it.  That's what I do; I just look at the pictures.

After a "few minutes," Lucy's "phone rings" and it' s her "best friend Marlene," and she says, "Well, come on Marlene, let's talk," and so she puts "down the magazine" and she spends a half an hour "chatting w ith her" friend.  To chat, "chat," means to talk to someone, usually about som ething that isn't very important.  She ends her story by saying, "There’s nothing like a good talk with a good friend to end a busy day."  There’s nothing li ke means that this is the best - the best possible thing.  The best possible thing is a good talk - a good conversation - with a good friend.  There's nothing  like listening to ESL Podcast to improve your English.  There's nothing like it!  I hope you agree.  Even if you don't, we're going to listen to the story now at a native rate of speech.

# Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 40: Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 40. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy go through  her bedtime ritual, and go to sleep. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to ge t ready for bed.  I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up.  I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a towel.  Then I put some toner on my face and  then some moisturizer.  I comb my hair and tie it back.  I don’t like getting  hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps.  I floss and brush my teeth, a nd am ready for bed.  By this time, I am pretty beat.

I go into my bedroom and I get undressed.  I put the dirty clothes in the hamper and put on my pajamas.  I take off my slippers and pull back the covers.  I check my alarm to make sure it’s on.  I have this same ri tual every night, which I think helps me fall asleep more easily.  It’s not long be fore I’m fast asleep.

[End of story]

Lucy begins by saying that she is "feeling pretty t ired," or very tired, "by 11:00" and decides "to get ready for bed."  She goes into her "bathroom to take off" her "make-up."  To take off means to remove or to get r id of her make-up.  She uses "a cleanser to wash" her "face," and then dries "it  with a towel."  A cleanser, "cleanser," comes from the word clean, "clean."  It  means something that you use to clean your face, in this example.  You could als o have a cleanser that cleaned other things.  But here, we use it to describe a li quid that you put on your face, kind of like a soap that helps clean your face, and  that's called a cleanser.

After Lucy washes her face with the cleanser, she then dries "it with a towel," "towel."  A towel is a piece of cloth or material t hat you use to dry things with. When Lucy is finished drying her face, she puts on "some toner," "toner."  Toner is a liquid that women put on their face, usually j ust women.  The liquid is

supposed to make the skin on a woman's face softer,  and also a little bit firmer - a little bit tighter.  This is something women do a t night after they have cleaned their face, I think.

The word toner comes from the verb to tone, "tone,"  which has a couple of different meanings, but is often used when you are talking about your muscles - that you want to make your muscles stronger so that  they look better.  This is a case of using the word as a noun, with an "r" at the end, toner, and as we said, it is a liquid that some women put on their face at ni ght.

Well, after Lucy puts this toner on her face, then she puts on "some moisturizer." Moisturizer, "moisturizer," comes from the word moi st, "moist," which means wet, the opposite of dry.  If we say something is moist,  we mean that it is wet - there is water on it.  A moisturizer, as a noun, is a liquid  that women put on their face, and sometimes their arms and legs, to make the skin  less dry - to give their skin more moisture, which is another noun that comes fro m the word moist.  It also makes their skin a little softer.

Then Lucy combs her hair and ties "it back."  To co mb, "comb," as a verb, means to use an instrument to straighten your hair - to p ut it in a certain place - to move your hair in a certain way.  The thing that you use  is called a comb, "comb."  So, it's both a verb and a noun.  A comb is usually a l ong piece of plastic, sometimes metal, that has little - almost like little sticks that come out of it, and we call those little sticks the teeth of the comb, just like your  teeth in your mouth.

Lucy combs her hair and ties "it back."  To tie, "t ie," something is to create - usually to create a little knot, "knot," which is w hen you take a piece of rope or string and you move it in such a way that it create s almost like a little lock, and we call that a knot.  For example, when you are tyi ng your shoes, you take the little strings in your shoes, such as tennis shoes - we called those strings shoelaces - and you tie knots in them so that they' re tight.  So, you tie a knot to keep a rope tight - to keep it from becoming loose.

In the story, Lucy says that she ties her hair back , which means she takes her hair, and because she has long hair, she takes her hair and she puts it toward the back of her head, and then she puts something a round it to keep it there so it doesn't go back onto her face.  This is tying it ba ck.

Lucy says that she doesn't "like getting hair in" h er "face," and that is why she ties her hair back.  Then she flosses and brushes h er teeth, and is now "ready for

bed.  By this time," she says," I am pretty beat," "beat."  When you say you are pretty beat, you mean you are very tired.

Lucy goes into her bedroom and she gets undressed.  To undress is the opposite of to dress.  To dress means to put clothes on you,  so to undress means to take your clothes off.  To get undressed means to undres s yourself - to take your clothes off.

Lucy takes her dirty clothes and puts them into a h amper.  A hamper, "hamper," is also sometimes called a clothes hamper, and it's  a little box, you can think of it as, it's a little box where you put your dirty clot hes or dirty towels that has a top on it.  It is - usually has a top on it, and that is a clothes hamper.  You often find them in a bedroom or sometimes in a bathroom.

After Lucy puts her "dirty clothes in the hamper," she puts on her pajamas. Pajamas, "pajamas," is a type of clothes that you w ear to bed.  So, they're special clothes that you wear when you are going to  go to bed and fall asleep.

Lucy takes off her slippers and pulls "back the cov ers."  She removes her slippers, "slippers."  Slippers are shoes that you wear inside your house.  They are usually soft and comfortable.  You wear them to  keep your feet warm, and also to keep them clean from your floors.  That's a  slipper.

To "pull back the covers" means to take the blanket  that is on your bed and to take the top and to pull it towards the bottom so t hat you can see the sheets of the bed.  Covers, remember, "covers," are the blank ets and the sheets that you put on top of your bed to keep you warm.  So, you p ull them back so you can get into the bed, and after you get into the bed, then you can pull them up - put them back over your body.

Lucy says that she has "this same ritual every nigh t."  A ritual, "ritual," is similar to a routine.  It's when you do the same things in the  same way over and over again.  Every day you get up, you brush your teeth,  you watch television, you go to work.  That could be your ritual - your routine - what you do on a regular basis. Ritual can also refer to a religious ceremony - a r eligious event, but here it just means the things that Lucy does every night.

She thinks that doing this ritual in the same way e very night helps her "fall asleep more easily."  To fall, "fall," asleep means to go to sleep.  "It's not long," she says, "before I am fast asleep."  To be fast asleep , "fast," means that you are

ESL Podcast 40 - Getting Ready for Bed and Going to  Sleep

completely asleep - that you cannot be easily woken  up.  You are very asleep, you might say.  You are fast asleep.

Well, I hope you have not fallen fast asleep and are ready to listen to our story again, this time at a regular speed.

[Start of story]

I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to ge t ready for bed.  I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up.  I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a towel.  Then I put some toner on my face and  then some moisturizer.  I comb my hair and tie it back.  I don’t like getting  hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps.  I floss and brush my teeth, a nd am ready for bed.  By this time, I am pretty beat.

I go into my bedroom and I get undressed.  I put the dirty clothes in the hamper and put on my pajamas.  I take off my slippers and pull back the covers.  I check my alarm to make sure it’s on.  I have this same ri tual every night, which I think helps me fall asleep more easily.  It’s not long be fore I’m fast asleep.

# Understanding Men and Women

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 41 – Understanding Men and Women.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 41. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss relationshi ps. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: Jeff, here's a question. I was just talking to Dawn. You know, they had their first wedding anniversary last week. Guess what her  husband gave her as a present.

Jeff: I don't know. What?

Lucy: He gave her a vacuum cleaner.

Jeff: Didn't she want a vacuum cleaner?

Lucy: Yes, the old one was broken, but that's not the point! It was their wedding anniversary, their first one. Dawn was really upset  that he wasn't more romantic. He really let her down.

Jeff: Oh, great. Women are always saying that men a ren't romantic. But we are! Just not in the way that women want.

Lucy: What do you mean?

Jeff: It's a man's job to protect his wife and fami ly. When something goes wrong, they want to fix it. That's the mark of a good husb and.

Lucy: I can see that, but that's not romantic in my  book.

Jeff: That's because you women have this idealized view of romance that you get from a lifetime of watching chick flicks and readin g romance novels. Even if a man wanted to, he could never get into the head of a woman and guess what she wanted. That's why women have to just tell us w hat they want.

Lucy: That's the problem. We women think men should  just know what we want, without us having to tell them; that is, if the man  really loved and understood us. That's why we don't want to tell you. But I see you r point, too.

Jeff: So, I guess it's really true. Men are from Ma rs and women are from Venus.

Lucy: Yeah, that's what makes life interesting, rig ht?

[end of dialogue]

In this episode, Lucy and I talked about men and wo men and how they understand or misunderstand each other – that is, n ot understand each other. Lucy began by saying, “Jeff, here's a question.” Th at expression “Here’s a question” means “I want to ask you a question.” It' s a way of introducing – we might say “prefacing” – a question. It's letting the other person know that you are going to ask them a question. Lucy said that she “w as just talking to Dawn.” She was recently talking to Dawn. When we say we are “j ust doing” something, we were recently, or right before this, doing somethin g.

She said that Dawn and her husband were having thei r first “wedding anniversary.” “Wedding” (wedding) is, of course, wh en people get married, and “anniversary” is when you celebrate every year, usu ally on that same day. So, if you get married on May first, you celebrate each an niversary on May first in the following years. My parents were married on May fir st. Lucy explained that Dawn's husband gave her a vacuum cleaner for their first wedding anniversary. A “vacuum (vacuum) cleaner” is what you use to get di rt out of a carpet or a rug. Usually, it's electric. The vacuum cleaner, Lucy th ought, is not a good gift for a wedding anniversary. Hmm, that's funny.

I asked Lucy if Dawn wanted one, and Lucy responded , or said in reply to me, “That's not the point.” “That's not the point” mean s that's not what's important. That's not what she meant. That wasn't what I was t hinking of. The “point” (point) of something is either the reason for something or the meaning of something. We often say, “The point is, I want you to do somethin g,” such as go to the store, meaning “What I'm really trying to say is” or “What  I really mean is this.”

Lucy said that her friend Dawn “was really upset.” “To be upset” (upset) means to be angry, to be mad, to be bothered by something. S he was upset because her husband “wasn't more romantic.” “To be romantic” (r omantic) means to be loving of your husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend. “R omance” refers to a love between two people. I, for example, am very romanti c with my wife, but just don't ask her about that.

 Anyway, Lucy said that Dawn's husband “really let h er down.” “To let someone down” is a phrasal verb that means to disappoint th em, to do something that they didn't or don't like. They were expecting one thing  and you did something else. For example, I was supposed to meet my friend last night at 6:00 p.m., but I forgot about it. I let down my friend, or I let my friend down. In either case, it means I didn't do what I was supposed to do or what  he expected me to do.

I then used the expression, “Oh, great.” “To be gre at” usually means to be very good, to be wonderful, to be the best. But when we use an expression with that sort of intonation, with that sort of sound in our voice – “Oh, great” – we’re really saying, “That's terrible. That's bad.” It's just the opposite of what you would think the meaning of great would be in this case.

In a way, we’re using it sarcastically. We are trying to use it in a different way from the way it is normally used in order to either  be funny or to communicate a different message to the person, to say something d ifferent. Somebody says, “Oh, great. My car broke down.” This person doesn't  actually mean they're happy that the car doesn't work. They mean the opposite. They mean it's bad news. It all depends on the way you say it. “Oh great” means  something bad. “Oh, great!” means something good.

I said to Lucy that men are romantic, but they're n ot romantic in a way that women want. Lucy asked me what I meant, and I tried  to explain that many men see their job in the family as protecting or taking  care of the wife and the family, and that this was a mark of a good husband. The exp ression “a mark” or “the mark” (mark) of a good husband means that it's a si gn of a good husband. It's an indication of a good husband. You can use this expr ession, “the mark of” something, with lots of different situations. You c ould say, “The mark of a good actor is that he can remember all of his dialogue,”  or his “lines” as we call them in a movie or in a play. “The mark of,” then, means the quality or characteristic of something.

Lucy said that she could understand my point – that  is, my meaning – but that what I was calling romantic was not romantic in her  book. The expression “in my book” or “in your book” or “in her book” does not m ean a book that you own and read. We’re not talking about that kind of book. In stead, we're talking about my way of seeing the world, according to my way of thi nking, the way I see things, or the way I view things. For example, “In my book, it 's better to exercise early in the morning so that you have time to do it before you g o to work.” “In my book” here means in my opinion, in my view – the way I view th ings.

I said to Lucy that women have an “idealized view of romance.” “Idealized” (idealized) would be the perfect situation. Somethi ng that is idealized would be something in the best possible situation. Usually w e use it, however, to mean unrealistic or impossible to actually do or achieve . When someone says to you, “Well, that's an idealized view of” something, they  mean that that particular way of looking at things would only be possible in a pe rfect world. It can't really be possible for the average person, say.

I then used the expression “chick flicks” and “roma nce novels.” A “chick (chick) flick (flick)” is an informal expression. It refers  to the kinds of movies that women like, often romantic movies. The word “chick” refer s to a woman or a girl. However, it's not a very nice word. Many women and girls might not like it if you use that word with them. So, it's probably one you should not use. A “flick” is a movie. So, a “chick flick” would be a movie for wom en and girls.

A “romance novel” is a novel that is about a romant ic relationship between two people who love each other. However, the term “roma nce novel” refers to a specific kind of book that is popular mostly with w omen, about the romantic relationship of the main characters. There’s usuall y a very beautiful woman and a very handsome or good-looking man in the story. is aid to Lucy that “a man could never get into the head of a woman.” “To get into s omeone's head” means to understand her point of view, to understand her opi nion, to understand how she views the world.

Lucy says, however, that if men really loved women and really understood them, women would not have to tell men what they want. Sh e uses the expression “that is.” She says, “That is, if the man really loved an d understood us.” The expression “that is” is very common in conversation . It means I'm going to give you more of an explanation. I'm going to tell you a  little bit more about what I just said. I'm going to try to make it clear. For exampl e, I could say to someone, “Podcasting involves RSS syndication; that is, it's  a network that goes out over the Internet.” “That is” is used to say, “Let me ex plain a little more” or “I will say it in a different way, perhaps a way that you'll under stand better.”

I end the dialogue by saying, “Men are from Mars an d women are from Venus.” That’s actually the title of a very popular book ab out men and women and relationships. It was very popular, at least, in the 1990s: Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus . The idea is that they basically come from differe nt planets. They see everything very differently, and that's why they don't understand each other. I actually read part of the book. I think he was right about a lot of things, the author. Of course, it was writ ten by a man. Remember that

opinions in these dialogues are not necessarily the  opinions of the people who are speaking the lines.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: Jeff, here's a question. I was just talking to Dawn. You know, they had their first wedding anniversary last week. Guess what her  husband gave her as a present.

Jeff: I don't know. What?

Lucy: He gave her a vacuum cleaner.

Jeff: Didn't she want a vacuum cleaner?

Lucy: Yes, the old one was broken, but that's not the point! It was their wedding anniversary, their first one. Dawn was really upset  that he wasn't more romantic. He really let her down.

Jeff: Oh, great. Women are always saying that men a ren't romantic. But we are! Just not in the way that women want.

Lucy: What do you mean?

Jeff: It's a man's job to protect his wife and fami ly. When something goes wrong, they want to fix it. That's the mark of a good husb and.

# Talking to a Professor

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 42 – Talking to a Professor. This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 42. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educat ional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. In this episode we're going to discuss speaking to your teacher or professor. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

[A knock on the door.]

Jeff: Come in.

Julie: Hi, Dr. McQuillan, I'm Julie Taylor. I'm in your two o'clock class on Thursdays.

Jeff: Hi, Julie. Have a seat. What can I do for you ?

Julie: I wanted to come see you during your office hours because I missed class last week. I had a family emergency.

Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. We went over a lot of  material, so make sure you get the notes from another student in class.

Julie: Thanks, I will. Did you give any assignments ?

Jeff: Yes, I assigned an essay on the topics in cha pter three of your textbook.

Julie: Oh, I see. Are there guidelines for the essa y?

Jeff: Yes, it should be 8 to 10 pages, and it's due  in two weeks. Take a look at your syllabus. It has more details.

Julie: I will. Thanks a lot. I've also been meaning  to talk to you about the trouble I'm having keeping up in class. I'm having trouble unde rstanding the lectures. Is there anything you would suggest?

Jeff: Some students tape-record the lectures and li sten to them afterwards. That seems to help.

Julie: That's a great idea. I'll definitely try tha t. I'm wondering if you give extra credit in your class.

Jeff: No, I don't give extra credit assignments. Bu t if you're worried about passing, there are still two more tests to pull up your grade.

Julie: Yes, I'll study hard for those. Thanks a lot  for your time.

Jeff: No problem. See you in class.

Julie: Okay, Professor McQuillan. See you Thursday.

[end of dialogue]

We just listened to a conversation between a profes sor and a student. The conversation began with the student knocking on the door of the office and the professor saying, “Come in.” That's the expression we use when we wan t someone to enter into a room, especially if they are knocking on our door. We say , “Come in.” The student, named Julie, introduces herself and tells me (since I'm the professor in the dialogue) which class she’s in. She says, “I’m in your two o'clock class,” meaning “I am a student in your class that begins at two o'clock in the afternoon.”

I then tell her to “have a seat.” “To have a seat” means please sit down. Please take a seat. “Have a seat” is perhaps a little more inform al than “Please sit down.” Julie then says that she wanted to come and talk to me during my “office hours.” At the university, a professor teaches his or her classes and then has  to be available to talk to students.

Most universities have their professors keep regula r “office hours,” meaning they are in their office a certain number of hours every week. It depends on the university. Different universities have different requirements. The unive rsities that I’ve taught in usually required five or six hours every week. Those were h ours where you had to be in your office at a scheduled time so that students could c ome by and talk to you if they wanted to. Of course, the professor doesn't want to talk to the student, typically.

Julie said that she had “missed class last week.” “ To miss (miss) class” means not to go to class, not to be in the classroom. We use that e xpression for anything that we are supposed to go to, or were going to go to and didn' t because, typically, we had some problem. For example, I missed that movie last nigh t I wanted to see. It was on television, but I forgot to watch it. The student s ays that she “had a family emergency.” The expression “family emergency,” or perhaps “pers onal emergency,” means that she had some serious problem related to someone in her family.

It's a very general expression that students someti mes use with their professors as a reason for not being in class. Of course, sometimes  students really do have family emergencies – perhaps their sister is sick or their  father had an accident or something along those lines. It could also even be a death in  the family. However, many students, I suspect . . . I think some people use that expressi on “family emergency” knowing that you won't ask too many questions because it's consi dered personal.

 I said to Julie that she missed a lot of material f or the class. I said, “We went over a lot of material.” “To go over something” means to talk abo ut it, to discuss it. In this case, from the professor's point of view, to teach it. We use this expression in a classroom, but you can use it for any situation where you're giving so meone information or where you are explaining something to someone. “Let me go over the instructions for using this computer.” That means let me talk about it; let me teach you or show you.

I said I “went over a lot of material.” The word “m aterial” (material) has several different meanings. It could be something physical. We could talk about the material that your clothes are made of or the material that a desk is made of. It could be made of wood. It could be made of metal. It could be made of plastic . Those are “materials.” When we talk about school, however, “material” refers to informa tion, the content of the actual class. That could include lectures, that could include rea dings, and so forth. All of that is considered “material” that you go over and explain.

I suggested to Julie – the student – that she “get the notes from another student.” In other words, she should talk to another student who  was in the class who took notes, who wrote down the information that I was presentin g or discussing in the class. Julie then asked if I had given any assignments in class.  An “assignment” is basically homework – things that students have to do or prepa re either to talk about at the next class session or to give to the teacher or professo r.

I said I had given an assignment. I said I had “ass igned an essay on the topics in chapter three” of the textbook. An “essay” is usual ly a long piece of writing that students do in school that demonstrates that they understand  the topic. A “textbook” in a school is a book with the information, or some information, a bout the topic of the class. Sometimes instead of “textbook” we simply say “text .” “What text are you using in this class?” That means, “What textbook are you using in  this class? What's the title of it?”

Julie asked if there were any “guidelines for the e ssay.” “Guidelines” means instructions or rules for something. The “guidelines” are the ba sic way in which the professor wants you to do something. The professor may say, “You ne ed to talk about three different sources of information.” That would be a guideline for writing an essay. “Guidelines” are not just for school, of course. You can have guidel ines in business, in government. Basically, it's another word for rules that you hav e to follow.

I told Julie that the essay was “due in two weeks.”  That means she had two weeks to give it to me. We would probably use the expression  “to hand in.” “To hand in” is a two- word phrasal verb that means to give, usually to a teacher, your assignment. When we say it's “due” (due), we mean that's when you have to hand it in. That's the date that you have to give it to your professor.

I suggested that Julie look at her syllabus. A “syl labus” (syllabus) is a piece of paper, usually several pieces of paper that describe what the course or the class is, including

the assignments, the readings, and when the examina tions or tests are. Most American universities require that professors give their stu dents a “syllabus” – an outline of everything they're going to talk about in class and  a list of all the assignments that they will be giving students.

Julie says that she had “been meaning to talk to” m e. The expression “to be meaning to” means you were planning on it. You were expecting to do something, but you haven't actually gotten to it yet. You didn't actually do it. You can say, “I've been meaning to see that movie.” That means I have been hoping to see it, I have been planning to see it, but I haven't actually gone to see it yet. Julie said s he had been meaning to talk to me about some trouble that she was having in “keeping up in class.” “To keep up” is another one of those wonderful phrasal verbs that means to be a ble to do the work that is required – in this case, for the class.

We use the expression “to keep up” in general to me an the opposite of “to fall behind.” “To fall behind” means that you are late for many t hings. You are not on schedule. You are not moving as fast as the other students. If yo u are keeping up, you are getting all of your assignments done, all of your readings done, j ust like everyone else in the class. If you're “falling behind,” that means that you are no t getting the things done like everyone else is getting them done in the class.

Julie says she was “having trouble understanding the lectures.” “To have trouble” means to have problems. “I'm having trouble” means I'm having problems, I'm having difficulties. The “lecture” (lecture) is when the professor stand s up in front of the class and gives them information, explains things to them. I sugges ted that Julie “tape-record the lectures” and that she “listen to them afterwards.”  “Afterwards” is the same as later – at a later time.

Julie asked me if I gave “extra credit” in the clas s. “Extra credit” in American schools and universities is when the teacher gives an extra ass ignment that students can do so that they can perhaps make up points for other assignmen ts, regular assignments on which they didn't do very well. “Extra credit” is a way of helping students who perhaps did very poorly on one of the examinations still get good gr ade in the class. It's extra work. Some professors give extra credit, other professors do n ot. When I was working as a professor, I never gave extra credit. Extra credit is just ano ther word for extra work for the professor. I was a mean professor, you know.

I told Julie that if she was worried about passing the class, about getting a good grade, there would be two more tests to pull up her grade.  “To pass a class” or “to pass a test” means to be successful, to get a good grade. “To pu ll up your grade” means to improve your grade, to increase your grade. It's a very com mon expression in schools. At the end of the conversation, Julie says, “Okay Professor Mc Quillan, see you Thursday,” meaning I will see you on Thursday. In class, I hope.

Notice that Julie calls me “Dr. McQuillan” and “Pro fessor McQuillan.” At universities in the United States, anyone who has a PhD or a doctor ate degree can be called “Doctor.” That doesn't mean they’re medical doctors. Someone teaching at a university can also be called a “professor,” especially if they work there full-time.

Now let’s listen to our dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

[A knock on the door.]

Jeff: Come in.

Julie: Hi, Dr. McQuillan, I'm Julie Taylor. I'm in your two o'clock class on Thursdays.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 43. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss taking a tr ip to the library. Let's get started.  > I read in the local paper that a new public library  had just opened two weeks ago in my neighborhood. I wanted to check it out. But f irst, I called the library to check the hours  of  operation . The librarian  told me that they were open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 6, so I decided to see the new library for myself.
> I parked my car in the library parking lot and walk ed in. There were two library clerks  behind the counter and a librarian at the reference  desk . I walked around and spotted the nonfiction  section and moved on to the fiction  stacks . There was a pretty good collection  in both of these areas. I wanted to see if they ha d a book I've been wanting to read. So, I went over to the computer to check the online catalog . As it turns out, they had one copy  and it had not been checked out . I wrote down the call  number  and went to the stacks. I found it right away.
> When I walked in, I also noticed that the library h ad music CDs, videos, and DVDs that could be checked out. I looked briefly at  the collection but decided not to check out any right then.
> I had my book and I was all set. I stood in line an d waited to check my book out. The library clerk said, "Next please," and I steppe d up to the counter. I asked her what the loan  period  was for the book. She told me that the due  date  was three weeks from today. I gave her my library  card . She scanned the bar  code  on my book and stamped  the due date on the back of it. It was quick and e asy. I was so glad to have a nice new library so close to home .

I described a visit I took to my new public library  in this podcast. I started by saying that I read about it in “the local paper.” B y “local (local)paper” I mean the local newspaper. We sometimes distinguish or try to  define as different, the local

paper from a national newspaper – The New York Time s, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today – these are all national, or in some cases, international newspapers. A “local paper” would be one that is re ad mostly in a single city or a single area. I said that I wanted to “check out” the new library. “To check something out” can have a couple of different meani ngs, especially when were talking about libraries. The first meaning is to in vestigate, to look into, to find out more about. You can say, for example, I'm going to check out his story. That means I'm going to investigate it. I'm going to see  if it's true. We can also use the expression “check out” to mean, look at or pay atte ntion to. You may see a beautiful car drive down the road and say to your f riend, “Check out that nice car.” You may see a beautiful woman walked down the  road and you may say to your friend, “Check out that beautiful woman.” Howe ver, when it's used talking about looking at a beautiful woman, it usually mean s to look at her in a way that indicates that you are romantically or sexually int erested in her. In general, however, “to check out” in this second, more inform al sense, means to look at or pay attention to. We’ll later see this phrasal verb  has a third meaning, especially regarding libraries.

I say that the library has certain “hours of operat ion.” The “hours of operation” are the hours that the library is open. I mentioned wal king into the library and seeing a couple of library clerks and a librarian at the r eference desk. The “library clerks” are the people in the library that help you check o ut and find books. Usually, “library clerks” don't have a lot of special traini ng or education. You don't have to go to school to be a library clerk. There are two m ain areas in the library where you will find people to talk to, who work for the l ibrary. The first is the “circulation desk.” The “circulation desk” is where you check ou t and return books. In most libraries, the “circulation desk” is run by or oper ated by the library clerks. Another place where you'll find someone to talk to is the “ reference desk.” “Reference” refers to books that you go to use in order to find  specific information, such as a dictionary or encyclopedia. At the “reference desk, ” typically, you will find a librarian. A “librarian,” in most places, is a pers on who's actually gone to school and studied something called “library sciences,” at  least that's what they call it nowadays. A “librarian” is someone who has a lot of  information about how to find a lot of information. That’s a “librarian.” the “librarian” works at the reference desk and the “library clerks,” typically, work at the circulation desk.

A “library” usually has two main sections, just lik e in a bookstore – if you can still find a bookstore, nowadays. One section is called the “non- fiction section.” The other section is called the “fiction” section. “Fic tion” refers to things that are invented, that are made up, that are imaginary. A n ovel, for example, is fiction. It's not real. Novels, poems, plays – all of these would be considered part of the “fiction” section. “Nonfiction” are things that are  true, things that exist in the real

world, we might say. A book of history, for example , would be in the non fiction section because it's about something that really ha ppened, or at least, it’s supposed to be. This library had a pretty good coll ection in both of these areas – fiction and nonfiction. A “collection,” usually ref ers to a group of objects, but here it refers to all of the books in a certain section of the library. You could have a good history collection, a good set of books about history. This library had a large collection in both areas – fiction and nonfiction –  meaning they had a lot of books in both areas, or in both sections.

I say in the story that I walked around and spotted  the nonfiction section. “To spot (spot) something” here means to find it, especially  if you've been looking for it. I moved on, or I continued on, to the fiction “stacks .” The word “stacks,” in a library, just refers to the shelves where the books  are kept, where you can actually find the books. Those are the “stacks.” In  some libraries, the stacks are closed to the public. In certain specialty librarie s, the librarian has to go back or send someone back to get the book off of the shelf.  In most public libraries, however, the stacks are open, meaning anyone can go  and check out a book. The opposite of “open stacks” would be “closed stac ks.” So, I'm interested in a specific book, according to the story, and I decide  to go over to look at the “online catalog.” A “catalog” (catalog) is basically a list  of the books that a library owns. Nowadays, most libraries have online catalogs, esse ntially databases that you can search through. In the old days, library catalo gs were little pieces of paper, little cards that would be inside a small drawer, a nd you would pull the drawer out and look for the book by going through all the diff erent cards. Those of us who are old enough to remember that, know that although  it wasn't the most efficient system, it did have some benefits over the current online systems that most libraries use, but we won't go into that now.

When you look up a book, you are looking up somethi ng called the “call number.” You are trying to find the call number of the book in order to find it in the stacks. The “call (call) number” is the number that every b ook is given uniquely, in order to put it on the shelf in a certain order. So, the books are lined up on the shelf, not in alphabetical order, but in “call number” ord er. There are two basic systems of call numbers in the United States. We won’t to t alk about it too much year. One of them is called the Dewey Decimal system, whi ch is the older system. A more recent one is called the Library of Congress s ystem. Most public libraries, I think, still use the Dewey Decimal system. Most aca demic and research libraries use the Library of Congress system. But all librari es use one of those two systems of call numbers. So, you find the call numb er and then you walk over to the shelves and find the book. In the story, I say that “as it turns out, they had one copy.” The expression “as it turns out,” means the result was. Sometimes, it can mean “to my surprise.” I wasn't expecting it. A s it turns out, the library had

one copy. The word “copy” here just refers to the a ctual physical book. If a library owns five copies of a book, that means that five pe ople can go in and each one of them can go home with a book. There are five phy sical books.

I say that the copy of the book I wanted had not ye t been “checked out.” Now we’ve come to the third meaning of this phrasal ver b “to check out” which means to take a book to the circulation desk and say, “I want to take this book home.” When you take something home with you from a librar y, that's called “checking it out,” or “checking out the book.” You can check out  a DVD. You can check out a CD. You can check out a book. I also mentioned that  the library had music CDs – that is, compact disc with music on them – videos a nd DVDs. The word “video” nowadays is often used to refer to the old videocas settes – the VHS cassettes. Most people don't watch those kinds of videotapes a nymore. They watch DVDs. I say that I don't want to check out any of these “ri ght then,” meaning right at that time. Instead, I go to the circulation desk and I w ait in line until the library clerk says, “Next, please.” That's an expression, you'll sometimes hear when you have a line of people waiting to talk to someone at a de sk or a counter. When the person is ready to talk to you, they may say “Next,  please,” meaning the next person in line should now come forward and talk to the person. The library clerk told me to step up or walk up to the counter. The w ord “counter” here just refers to a long, tall desk. On one side of the desk, is the person who works for the library or a  business. On the other side of the de sk is the customer, or in a library, we would call him a “patron” (patron). Som eone who uses the library is called a “library patron.”

I asked the library clerk about the loan period for  the book. The “loan period” is how long you can keep the book before you have to bring it back. She then told me that the due date was three weeks from today. the “due (due) date” is the date that you have to bring it back, the date that the loan period ends. I then gave her my library card. This is a small plastic card t hat you use in order to check out a book. Usually, the card has its own barcode on the back. These are a series of small little lines that can be read electronically by a machine. Library cards have barcodes. So do library books. So, when I gave the book to the library clerk, she scanned the barcode first on my card, one presumes,  and then she scanned the barcode on the book. “To scan” (scan) means to take  one of these machines and put it over the bar code so that the machine can re ad the information from the barcode.

I then say the library clerk “stamped the due date”  on the back of the book. That’s something that a lot of libraries used to do. It's not as common anymore. They would put a little piece of paper on the back of the book and then they would take a little rubberstamp with ink on it and put the dat e when you had to return the

book. So that you could just look at the book and k now when the due date was. Nowadays, they usually just give you a little sheet  of paper printed out from the computer that tells you the due date. Of course, th en you bring the book home and you lose the little piece of paper and then you  have to go online and see when the due date is. So, I’m not sure the new tech nology has been a great improvement. In any case, I say the process was “qu ick and easy,” meaning it was very simple and very fast

Now let's listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.  > I read in the local paper that a new public library  had just opened two weeks ago in my neighborhood. I wanted to check it out. But f irst, I called the library to check the hours  of  operation . The librarian  told me that they were open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 6, so I decided to see the new library for myself.

# Hiring for a Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 44 - Hiring for a Job.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 44. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we’re going to discuss choosing wh om to hire for a job. Let’s get started.  > Last week, my administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. It couldn't have come at a worse time. It wa s a very busy time of year, but there was nothing I could do. Right away, we put a want ad in the classifieds and received several applications for the job. I called  in four of them for interviews, and I had narrowed it down to two candidates.
> The first was Claudia Trujillo. From her résumé, I knew that she had had four years of experience working at a telecommunications  company. She looked promising, and when she arrived for the interview, she was dressed professionally and seemed personable. When I asked her about her experience, she answered my questions with confidence. She soun ded like a hard worker and showed a lot of perseverance. The only drawback s were that she was a little chatty and she also seemed a little disorganized.
> The second candidate was Alex Mayhew. Alex had more  experience than Claudia, but in different capacities, and only had one year of experience as an administrative assistant. When I met Alex, he seeme d a little rough around the edges. He was earnest and eager but didn't have the  air of someone who had worked in a corporate environment. Still, he seemed  bright and easy to get along with. He did strike me as being a little shy, but I  think that was because he was nervous.
> So, those are my two options. Now, which one should  I hire? I need to give it some more thought.

Lucy begins her story by talking about hiring, or f illing a job position that is open in her company. She started by saying that her “adm inistrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks.” An “admi nistrative assistant” is someone who works for a boss or, really, works for anyone in a company who has the job of taking care of or administering some thing, whether it's running a department or running a project or just simply runn ing a large operation.

An “assistant” is always someone who helps someone else. The word “administrative” refers to taking care of something , running something, managing something. In the old days, we used to call this pe rson a “secretary.” But nowadays, “secretary” doesn't sound very important,  and so now we call these people “administrative assistants.” It’s sort of li ke a teacher is called a “teacher” if they're in a high school or grade school, but when they go to the university, they’re called a “professor.” It sounds more import ant, doesn't it? Sometimes administrative assistants do more than just type le tters and make copies and, nowadays, send emails. “Administrative assistants” sometimes do other things.

There's also another job category called a “persona l assistant.” A “personal assistant” is different than an administrative assi stant in that a personal assistant usually helps someone take care of their personal m atters. People who have a lot of money – people who are rich – often don't ha ve a lot of time, and so they hire a personal assistant to go and buy their groce ries and pay their bills and get their cars fixed and so forth. An “administrative a ssistant” is always someone related to a specific job within a company, for exa mple. Lucy's administrative assistant “gave notice.” “To give notice” (notice) means to tell your company that you are going to leave, that you are quitting.

In this case, Lucy’s administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. Two weeks is a common time that people g ive here in the United States, if they're going to quit a job. In fact, so me jobs require that you give them a “two-week notice,” meaning you give them at least  two weeks’ advanced notice that you are going to quit. So, if you're going to quit on the 14th of the month, you have to tell them by the 1st of the month that you are going to quit. Of course, I’m not sure what they would do if you didn't give them  two weeks notice. It's more of a courtesy thing – that is, it's more of a nice thi ng to do, a professional thing to do.

Lucy said that this decision of her administrative assistant to quit “couldn't have come at a worse time.” This expression, “couldn't h ave come at a worse (worse) time,” is used when something very bad has happened  to us and there are other bad things that will happen because of it, or they happen at the same time. If you drive in your car and it begins to rain, that might  be considered something bad

happening. Then five minutes later if you run out of gas, that, of course, would be worse. That would be something that would be in add ition to the bad thing that already happened. So, if something bad is already h appening and then something else that is bad happens, we might use th is expression, “It couldn't have come at a worse time.”

Lucy says she put a “want ad in the classifieds.” A  “want (want) ad (ad)” is an advertisement or notice that you used to put in the  newspaper – now, you would put it on the Internet – that is used to find someo ne for a job. If your company needs someone for a certain job, they need to hire someone. They might put a want ad in the newspaper or on the Internet.

The “classifieds” is a general term we use for adve rtising or notices that appear typically in the back of a newspaper. The “classifi ed ads” are small little advertisements, often for people who are selling th eir cars or selling furniture. One section of the classified ads is called the “wa nt ads,” and these are ads for jobs. There are also personal ads in a classified a ds section. These are ads for people who, I guess, are looking for friendship or love – at least, that's one of the things you would put in a personal ad. It could be for other things as well. Nowadays people just put things on their Facebook p age, I guess.

Lucy said that she called in four candidates to int erview. “To call in” is a phrasal verb meaning to contact or email or call someone an d ask them if they would come to the office in order to be interviewed. “To interview” someone means to sit down and ask them questions – in this case, abo ut their experience – so that you can decide whether you want to give them a job or not. Lucy says she “narrowed it down” to two candidates. A “candidate”  here means someone who is applying for a job, someone who wants a certain job . They don't have the job yet; they want the job. You are still deciding.

Lucy “narrowed it down to two candidates.” “To narr ow something down” is a phrasal verb meaning to reduce the number of possib ilities. If you have ten people applying for the job – who want the job – yo u may “narrow it down” to a group of two or three people. You’re getting rid of  some people and focusing on just a small group. The first person Lucy talked to  was Claudia Trujillo. Lucy says, “From her résumé, I knew that she had had fou r years of experience working at a telecommunications company.”

A “résumé” (résumé) is a list of all of your educat ion, experiences, and the jobs that you have had in the past. It's what you give s ome potential employers, someone who might give you a job, to let them know what your experience is. For certain kinds of jobs, such as a job at the uni versity, we don't use the word

résumé. We use the words “curriculum vitae.” ”Vitae ” (vitae) is a Latin word. We will often just use the abbreviation “CV.” A “CV” is simply a professional résumé – a résumé for a more important job or a job at the u niversity.

Lucy says the person she was going to interview, Cl audia, worked at “a telecommunications company.” A “telecommunications company” might be, for example, a telephone company – a company that deals  with any sort of electronic communications. Lucy said that Claudia “ looked promising” because she “dressed professionally and seemed personable.”  When we say you “look promising,” we mean that it looks like you're prett y good. It looks like you may be a good person, in this case, for the job.

“To dress professionally” means to dress in a forma l way. The way you would dress to an office meeting or a special event, a bu siness event. For a man, that usually means wearing a suit and a tie and pants. F or a woman, it might be a business suit or possibly a dress. That would be “d ressing professionally.” Wearing a bikini or T-shirts or shorts and tennis s hoes – those would not be examples of dressing professionally. Unless you wor ked at the beach, of course.

Lucy said the candidate was “personable.” “To be pe rsonable” (personable) means to be kind, to be polite, to be nice. The can didate that Lucy was interviewing “spoke with confidence.” “To speak wit h confidence” means to be sure of yourself, to answer knowing that you are gi ving the correct answer. She said this woman Claudia was “a hard worker.” A “har d worker” is someone who works hard, who works very well, who doesn't sit ar ound and look at their Facebook page or surf the Internet or read their em ail. It's a person who is actually working – not a person who is sitting arou nd listening to podcasts, for example.

She also described Claudia as someone who “showed a  lot of perseverance.” “Perseverance” comes from the verb “to persevere” ( persevere), which means to continue doing your work even though there are a lo t of difficulties. Someone with perseverance continues on even though it is di fficult. The only drawbacks that Lucy found with this candidate were that “she was a little chatty” and “seemed a little disorganized.”

A “drawback” (drawback) is a disadvantage, a negati ve thing about a person or a situation. The “drawbacks” for Claudia are that “sh e was a little chatty” and she “seemed a little disorganized.” “To be chatty” (cha tty) means to talk too much. “To be disorganized” means to be not organized, to be someone who doesn't have everything neat and clean on their desk, to be  someone who doesn't seem

to know what to do next, who doesn't have a good pl an for the future. That might describe a “disorganized” person. That also describ es me, I think.

Lucy interviewed another candidate, another person who wanted this job, by the name of Alex. She says Alex had different “capaciti es.” “Capacities” means abilities, things that you are able to do. He was, however, “a little rough around the edges.” That expression “to be a little rough ( rough) around the edges (edges)” means that you don't have a lot of experie nce. You have a lot of potential. You have a lot of possibilities, but you  still don't have a lot of experience. That is to be “rough around the edges.”  You need more training, more time on the job, to be what you have the poten tial to be.

Lucy said Alex was “earnest and eager.” “To be earn est” (earnest) means here, basically, to be honest, to be sincere, to be someo ne who you can trust. “To be eager” (eager) means to be very motivated, to be wi lling to do something. Lucy also said that Alex “didn't have the air of someone  who had worked in a corporate environment.” “To have the air (air) of” something means to give the impression, to appear. “That person has the air of someone who is very intelligent” means he appears to be; he looks to be  someone who is very intelligent.

Well, Alex did not “have the air of someone who had  worked in a corporate environment.” A “corporate environment” just means a large company, a large business. The candidate Lucy interviewed was “brigh t and easy to get along with.” “To be bright” means to be intelligent, to b e smart. If you're “easy to get along with,” you’re someone who is personable, who’ s easy to talk to, who doesn't cause a lot of problems.

Lucy then says that Alex “did strike me as being a little shy.” The expression “to strike you” or “to strike me” means to appear to yo u or to appear to me. “He strikes me as an honest man” means it seems to me t hat he is an honest man. That's the impression I get from talking to him. Al ex strikes Lucy as being someone who is a little shy. If you're “shy” (shy),  you're the opposite of “chatty.” You don't like to talk to people. You perhaps are a  little afraid to go up to someone and talk to them and try to communicate wit h them. Lucy said she was going to review her options – her choices – and tha t she needed to “give it some more thought.” “To give something more thought” mea ns to think about it more, to consider it for a longer period of time.

Now let's listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

 Last week, my administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. It couldn't have come at a worse time. It wa s a very busy time of the year, but there was nothing I could do. Right away, we pu t a want ad in the classifieds and received several applications for the job. I ca lled in four of them for interviews, and I had narrowed it down to two candi dates.

The first was Claudia Trujillo. From her résumé, I knew that she had had four years of experience working at a telecommunications  company. She looked promising, and when she arrived for the interview, she was dressed professionally and seemed personable. When I asked her about her experience, she answered my questions with confidence. She soun ded like a hard worker and showed a lot of perseverance. The only drawback s were that she was a little chatty and she also seemed a little disorganized.

The second candidate was Alex Mayhew. Alex had more  experience than Claudia, but in different capacities, and only had one year of experience as an administrative assistant. When I met Alex, he seeme d a little rough around the edges. He was earnest and eager but didn't have the  air of someone who had worked in a corporate environment. Still, he seemed  bright and easy to get along with. He did strike me as being a little shy, but I  think that was because he was nervous.

So, those are my two options. Now, which one should  I hire? I need to give it some more thought.

# A Camping Trip

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 45 – A Camping Trip.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 45. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss taking a ca mping trip. Let’s get started.  > My friends and I decided to take a trip to Yosemite  National Park to do some camping and hiking. We all like the outdoors, but w e all live in the city. We have all been griping about feeling cooped up, so we dec ided to take a road trip. This trip would give all of us a break from the traffic,  noise, and smog that we all deal with in L.A.
> Before we left, I went to the sporting goods store to get some new gear and equipment. I had a tent, but I needed a new sleepin g bag, one that was waterproof. I also needed some new hiking boots. Lu cky for me, I found everything in one stop, and by the time I left the store, I was really psyched about the trip.
> Early on Saturday morning, my friend Rachel came to  pick me up. None of us had a camper, but Rachel had an SUV that fit all of  us comfortably. I was the last one to be picked up, and I put my backpack and othe r gear in the trunk. I was about to get into the car when I realized I had lef t my sunscreen in the house. I rushed back in and grabbed it, and then we were off . I couldn't wait to get some fresh air and plenty of exercise. Yosemite, here we  come!

Lucy described in this story a trip that she and he r friends took to Yosemite National Park. A “national park” in the United Stat es is a park that is run by or operated by the federal or national government. The re are many national parks in the United States, as there are in other countries.  “Yosemite” is a national park here in California, in northern California. I mysel f have never been to Yosemite National Park, unfortunately. I hear it's very beau tiful.

Lucy and her friends were going to Yosemite in our story to do some camping and some hiking. “To camp” (camp) means to have a t ent and to sleep on the ground underneath the tent – at least, that's one w ay of camping. A “tent” (tent) is something made out of, usually, cloth with some pol es, and you put the poles – the metal poles, or the plastic poles – into the gr ound, and you put the material – the cloth material – over it. That gives you some p rotection from the rain, for example. “To hike” (hike) means to walk in an area usually outside – that is, in a park environment. “To go hiking” usually means to g o out away from the city, or at least away from the main part of the city, into a park.

Lucy and her friends “all like the outdoors.” When we talk about the “outdoors” (outdoors) – one word – we’re talking about anywher e that is not inside a building or inside a house. As a noun, there is always an “s ” at the end. We talk about the “outdoors,” not the “outdoor.” You could use “outdo or” without the “s” as an adjective. You can talk about an “outdoor barbecue, ” a barbecue – a place where you cook food – that is outside of your house. Alth ough you can talk about the outdoors without talking about going to a park or a  lake or river, usually when people use that term they are talking about exactly  those kinds of places: a park, a river, and so forth.

Lucy says that she and her friends “have all been g riping about feeling cooped up.” So, they “decided to take a road trip.” “To gr ipe” (gripe) means to complain, to complain very loudly. “To feel cooped (cooped) u p” means to feel like you're inside of a cage. We have on a farm something calle d a “chicken coop.” That's the cage where you keep the chickens. “To feel coop ed up,” then, means to feel like you are being trapped, like you can’t go out a nd do things.

Lucy and her friends were “feeling cooped up,” so they decided to go out on this trip, what she calls a “road trip.” The term “road trip” means that you take a car to get to the place where you're going. You can't take  an airplane or a train. A “road trip” is always involving an automobile.

Lucy says her friends wanted “a break from the traf fic, noise, and smog” that they deal with in L.A. When you want a “break” (break) f rom something, you mean you want to be separated from it. You want time when yo u're not near it or part of it. It's sort of like having a vacation from something.  “I need a break from my work.” “I need a break from watching this movie.” I need to get up and do something different. The word “break” as a noun can mean a ti me of rest in between, typically, times of work or some other activity. A “break from” means you want to get away from something.

Lucy and her friends want to get away from “the tra ffic, noise, and smog.” “Traffic” refers to having a lot of cars on the roa d – too many cars, so that you have to drive very slowly. “Noise” is a word you pr obably know. If you don't, you can come to my house and listen to the children of my neighbor. “Smog” (smog) is a combination of the words “smoke” and “fog.” Re ally it means pollution. Here in Los Angeles, unfortunately, like in many large c ities, there is often smog during the week – pollution caused by cars and factories a nd other things that cause pollution. Dogs, I suppose. Well, okay, maybe not d ogs.

In any case, there's a lot of pollution in a city l ike Los Angeles. Lucy's friends have to deal with this pollution. “To deal with” so mething means to handle, to manage something. “I have to deal with the problem”  means I have to take care of this problem. I have to handle this problem. Luc y continues by saying, “Before we left, I went to the sporting goods store to get some new gear and equipment.” A “sporting goods store” is a store that sells thin gs that you would use for sports or possibly for going outside to the outdoors and d oing something like camping.

“Gear” (gear) is a general term to mean the equipme nt that you use to do a certain activity. We could talk about the recording  gear in a recording studio. That would be the equipment – the microphones, the compu ters, and so forth that are used to do the recording. The word “gear” is used i n a lot of different circumstances. Here, it's used in talking about the  equipment or things that you would need to go camping. You're going to need a te nt to go camping. You're also probably going to want a sleeping bag.

A “sleeping bag” is a large cloth bag that you wrap  around your body, and then you zip it up. You close it. It's to help you keep warm and dry when you are sleeping out in the tent when you go camping. Lucy says she wants her sleeping bag to be “waterproof.” The word “waterproof” means  that it won't get wet, or if it gets wet, the inside of the sleeping bag won't get wet so you don't get wet. Lucy also said that she “needed some new hiking boots.” “Boots” are special shoes that you wear to do things like hiking.

She then says, “Lucky for me, I found everything in  one stop, and by the time I left the store, I was really psyched about the trip .” Lucy found everything “in one stop” – that is, in one place. She was “psyched” (p syched) about the trip. “To be psyched about” something is an informal term that h as become popular in the last 20 years or so to mean to be excited about som ething, to be ready to do something, to be looking forward to doing something . It is, as I say, a very informal expression, but very common.

She says that early on Saturday morning, her friend  Rachel came to pick her up – to drive her to where she wanted to go. She said,  “None of us had a camper.” A “camper” would be an actual vehicle like a car or t ruck – a big truck, you could think of it as – in which you could sleep. This wou ld be the only way I would ever go camping. Real campers don't have campers. They s leep in tents outside on the ground where it's very uncomfortable. Lucy's fr iend had an SUV that they took to go camping. An “SUV” is a “sport utility ve hicle.” It's basically a very large car. It’s sort of between a car and a truck.

Lucy said that she put her “backpack and other gear  in the trunk.” A “backpack” is a bag that you will see people wearing on their back to carry things like their books. This is very common in American universities  and colleges. Almost every student has a backpack. Students from other countri es sometimes think this is strange, because they think about backpacks as bein g for young children in elementary school. But here in the United States, c ollege students very commonly wear backpacks. The “trunk” of a car is the back part of the car, at least an American car, where you put your gear: you r luggage, your bags, and so forth.

Lucy realized that she had left her sunscreen in the house. “Sunscreen” (sunscreen) is basically a kind of lotion, a kind of liquid that you put on your skin so that your skin doesn't burn in the sun. This is something I have to put on anytime I go out in the sun, because I get sunburne d very easily. Lucy went back. She says she “rushed back.” She went quickly into her house and grabbed the sunscreen. “To grab” here means simply to pick it up. Then she says, “We were off.” When we say “we are off,” we mean we are  on our way. We have begun our journey. We have begun our trip.

Lucy ends by saying, “I couldn't wait to get some f resh air and plenty of exercise. Yosemite, here we come!” Lucy wants “to get some fr esh air.” That's a way of saying you want to get away from the pollution and the smog. You want to get away from being in a house or a building all the ti me and breathe in good air, fresh air. That's what Lucy wants on her camping tr ip.

She ends by saying, “Yosemite, here we come!” We so metimes use that expression “here we come” when we are going on a tr ip. If you're going to take a trip to New York City, when you get to the airport,  you might say, “New York City, here we come.” We are on the way. We are traveling there. There is an old song called “California, Here I Come,” meaning I'm on my  way to California.

“California, here I come, right back where I starte d from.”

Well, I won't sing the song now. Instead, let’s lis ten to our story, this time at a normal speed.  > My friends and I decided to take a trip to Yosemite  National Park to do some camping and hiking. We all like the outdoors, but w e all live in the city. We have all been griping about feeling cooped up, so we dec ided to take a road trip. This trip would give all of us a break from the traffic,  noise, and smog that we all deal with in L.A.
> Before we left, I went to the sporting goods store to get some new gear and equipment. I had a tent, but I needed a new sleepin g bag, one that was waterproof. I also needed some new hiking boots. Lu cky for me, I found everything in one stop, and by the time I left the store, I was really psyched about the trip.
> Early on Saturday morning, my friend Rachel came to  pick me up. None of us had a camper, but Rachel had an SUV that fit all of  us comfortably. I was the last one to be picked up, and I put my backpack and othe r gear in the trunk. I was about to get into the car when I realized I had lef t my sunscreen in the house. I rushed back in and grabbed it, and then we were off . I couldn't wait to get some fresh air and plenty of exercise. Yosemite, here we  come!

# Getting Ready to Go

Welcome the English as a Second Language Podcast nu mber 46 – Getting Ready to Go.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 46. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss getting rea dy for work on Monday mornings. Let's get started.  > I guess I'm just like everybody else. I could do wi thout Mondays. On the weekend, I can kick back and relax, but I dread going back to work when the weekend is over.
> This morning was particularly hectic. On weeknights , I set my alarm for seven a.m. That's what I did last night. But when I woke up this morning and looked at my alarm clock, it was seven thirty! The alarm cloc k was on the fritz and it didn't go off. Oh no, I was going to be late again.
> I washed my face, put on my makeup, got dressed, an d ate a small bowl of cereal. I had one foot out the door when I realized  I didn't have my keys. I went back into my bedroom and looked on the shelf where I kept them. No luck. Maybe I left them in my purse. I hunted around for them. Finally, I just dumped out everything from my purse onto my bed. I had my wallet, sunglasses, compact, lipstick, eye drops, aspirin, and tissues.  But no keys.
> I looked around the living room. Maybe they fell be hind the couch cushions. I picked up each one and looked. No keys. I went into  my closet and checked the pockets of my coat. Still, no keys. By this time, I  was pretty frantic, so I tried to calm myself down. I decided to get a drink of water . I opened the refrigerator and what did I see? My keys. They were sitting on the s helf right next to the milk. I must have left them there when I got the milk for m y cereal. It served me right for being so absentminded.
> Oh, how I hate Monday mornings!

Lucy talked about the problem she had getting to wo rk this morning. She said, “I guess I'm just like everybody else” – I'm the same as everyone else. “I could do without Mondays.” The expression “I could do withou t” something means I would rather not have something or I would prefer not to have something. In this case, Lucy prefers not to have Mondays because, of course , Monday is the first day of the work week.

She says, “On the weekend, I can kick back and rela x.” “To kick back” is an informal phrasal verb meaning the same, really, as to relax – to not do anything very difficult, to be calm, to not have to work. “T o kick back” means to enjoy yourself without having to do anything too difficul t. Lucy said that she dreaded going back to work when the weekend was over. “To d read” (dread) means to really hate something, to really not want to do som ething, or to really dislike someone. “I dread talking to my brother-in-law.” Th at means I don't look forward to it. It's not something I want to do. In fact, I hate doing it. That’s not true, actually. My brother-in-law is a very nice guy.

Lucy continues, saying, “This morning was particula rly hectic.” When we say something is “hectic” (hectic), we mean it’s very b usy, too busy. When you are so busy that you can't concentrate or think about anyt hing else, that might be described as a “hectic situation.” “This morning,” according to Lucy, “was particularly hectic” – especially hectic.

“On weeknights,” she says, “I set my alarm for seve n a.m.” “To set your alarm” means to take your alarm clock and program it or se t it for the hour that you want it to ring, that you want it to go off – that you want it to make a noise so that you wake up. “Alarm clocks” are clocks that people use so they can wake up at the right time in the morning. Lucy has an alarm clock that she normally sets for seven a.m., but when she woke up this morning, she says, and looked at her alarm clock, “it was seven thirty.”

Obviously, we have a problem here. The problem is t hat “the alarm clock was on the fritz.” This expression “to be on the fritz” (f ritz) means simply to be broken. It's not as common now as it was a few years ago, but yo u'll still hear people talking about some piece of machinery or some piece of equi pment being “on the fritz.” It's not working. “My computer is on the fritz. I t ried to start it and it won't work.” The alarm clock, because it was on the fritz, didn' t go off – didn't make any noise, any sound.

Lucy says she got up and washed her face and then p ut on her makeup. “Makeup” (makeup) is anything that you put, usually , on your face, such as lipstick and other things that women put on their f ace to make them beautiful, that

I don't really know much about. Lucy puts on her ma keup, gets dressed, and eats a small bowl of cereal – a common breakfast food th at people eat with milk.

She says, “I had one foot out the door when I reali zed I didn't have my keys.” The expression “to have one foot out the door” means yo u are already in the act of leaving. You are already leaving wherever it is tha t you are. That's “to have one foot out the door.” She realized that she didn't ha ve her keys. She went back into her bedroom and looked on the shelf where she norma lly keeps them. Your “keys” are what you use to open a door.

Lucy can't find her keys so she goes into her bedro om and looks on the shelf. A “shelf” (shelf) is a place where you store things l ike books in a room. Lucy then says, “No luck.” That means she wasn't able to find  them. She didn't have any luck. She continues, “Maybe I left them in my purse .” A “purse” is something that many women carry that contains their, nowadays, cel l phone and lipstick and makeup and toothpaste and hammers and animals. Well , at least that's what I think is in a woman's purse. No man actually knows what's inside of a woman's purse, even when they are married to that woman.

Lucy cannot find her keys in her purse. She says, “ I hunted around for them.” “To hunt around” is a phrasal verb meaning to look thro ugh a certain area to try to find something. She then “dumped out everything” fr om her purse. “To dump (dump) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to empty – to  take everything out of a bag and put it on the table or on the floor. Lucy dumpe d out everything from her purse onto her bed.

She then sees the inside of her purse. She has her wallet, where she keeps their money; her sunglasses, which she uses to protect he r eyes from the bright sun; her compact, lipstick, eye drops, aspirin, and tiss ues. Didn't I tell you that women keep lots of different things in their purses? I me an look at all the things that Lucy has.

In addition to her wallet and sunglasses, she has s omething called a “compact” (compact). A “compact” is a small container of powd er that women put on their faces as part of their makeup. “Lipstick” is a kind  of makeup that goes on your lips. “Eye drops,” of course, would be if you had p roblems with your eyes. “Aspirin” is for when you have a headache, like aft er talking to your husband. “Tissues” are used for blowing your nose or for cle aning off parts of your face or body. All of these things are inside of Lucy's purs e, but not her keys.

She then looks around the living room. “To look aro und” means to look in that area, similar to “to hunt around.” She says, “Maybe  they fell behind the couch

cushions.” A “couch” (couch) is a sofa – a place wh ere three or four people can sit, usually in the main room or living room of a h ouse. “Cushions” are the things that you sit on. Sometimes, keys will fall in behin d the cushions in the couch. Lucy picked up each one – each cushion – and looked , but she didn't find her keys. Then she went to her “closet,” a place where she keeps her clothing, and checked the pockets of her coat. “Still,” she says,  “no keys.”

“By this time,” she says, “I was pretty frantic.” “ To be frantic” (frantic) means to be very worried, to be very nervous about something. S he says she tried to calm herself down, to make herself not get so excited. S he “decided to get a drink of water” – a glass of water. She opened the refrigera tor and what did she see? Of course, her keys. Her keys were in the refrigerator . “They were sitting on the shelf right next to the milk” – they were sitting o n the shelf near, or right next to, the milk. “I must have left them there when I got the milk for my cereal,” Lucy says.

Finally, she says, “It served me right for being so  absentminded.” The expression “to serve someone right” means that someone deserve s something, usually deserves something bad. When you say, “It serves hi m right” or “It serves her right,” you mean that something bad has happened to  them, but it's their own fault. It was only just. It was only fair that that  should happen to that person. She says she was “absentminded.” “To be absentminded” m eans to be forgetful – not to be paying attention to what's going on around yo u.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I guess I'm just like everybody else. I could do wi thout Mondays. On the weekend, I can kick back and relax, but I dread going back to work when the weekend is over.

This morning was particularly hectic. On weeknights , I set my alarm for seven a.m. That's what I did last night. But when I woke up this morning and looked at my alarm clock, it was seven thirty! The alarm cloc k was on the fritz and it didn't go off. Oh no, I was going to be late again.

# Teamwork

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 47 – Teamwork.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 47. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss getting alo ng with people, whether at work or at school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: So, does that sound okay with you?

Lucy: What? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you s aid.

Jeff: You seem preoccupied today. What's up?

Lucy: Oh, it's this guy I know from this class I'm taking. His name is Richard. I think I've mentioned him before.

Jeff: Yeah, sure, the guy you're working on a proje ct with, right?

Lucy: Yeah, that's him. The four of us are supposed  to be working as a team on this project, and I'm having a lot of trouble deali ng with him.

Jeff: What do you mean?

Lucy: Well, he doesn't know how to express his opin ion without putting other people down. And, he always has to be right.

Jeff: He sounds a little immature.

Lucy: Yeah, I think it's partly that. He doesn't kn ow how to be diplomatic with people.

Jeff: He doesn't know how, or he doesn't want to?

Lucy: I don't know, but I do know that sometimes he  really gets the better of me.

Jeff: Well, he sounds pretty hard to get along with . Are the other people in your group feeling the same way?

Lucy: Yeah, in fact, they're fed up with him. I kee p having to run interference when our discussions get too heated. Actually, I fe el really sorry for the guy. He doesn't seem to have too many friends, and he alway s seems so unhappy.

Jeff: Well, I think you're helping just by putting up with him.

Lucy: Thanks for trying to make me feel better. Ok,  now what were you saying?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with me saying to Lucy, “So, do es that sound okay with you?” The expression “to sound (sound) okay with so meone” or “to someone” means “Does it seem like a good idea?” Do you think  this is acceptable? Does it sound okay? Lucy says, “What? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn 't hear what you said.” Lucy, of course, is not paying attention to what I am say ing. This happens all the time.

I say, “You seem preoccupied today. What's up?” “To  be preoccupied” (preoccupied) means to be distracted, not to be foc used on what you are doing – thinking about something else instead of what you s hould be thinking about. That's being “preoccupied.” The word “occupied” mea ns to be busy. “To be preoccupied” means to be busy in your mind, thinkin g of lots of different things, too busy to focus on what you should be doing. Jeff  then says – and that's me – “What's up?” meaning “What's going on?”

Lucy says, “Oh, it's this guy I know from this clas s I'm taking.” Now, we learned that Lucy is a student and she's thinking about a g uy – a man – in this case from her class that she is taking, that she is studying in. She says, “His name is Richard. I think I've mentioned him before.” I say,  “Yeah sure, the guy you're working on a project with, right?” – the person tha t you are working on some sort of project for the class with. Lucy says, “Yeah, th at's him. The four of us are supposed to be working as a team on this project, a nd I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with him.”

So, there are four people in this group that are su pposed to be working on a project together, perhaps writing a paper – writing  an essay or something similar. She says that she's “having a lot of trouble dealin g with” Richard. “To deal with” someone is a phrasal verb meaning to handle someone , to manage someone, to be able to get along with and work with someone or some problem. We will

sometimes say, “I need to deal with this problem ri ght now.” That means “I need to work on this problem – manage it, solve it.”

I then say to Lucy, “What do you mean?” What are yo u trying to tell me, Lucy? Lucy says, “Well, he doesn't know how to express his opinion without putting other people down.” “To put other people down” or “ to put down other people” means to criticize them, to insult them by talking as though they weren't as good as you. When you “put someone down,” you are saying  they are not as good as you. You are saying something mean or critical abou t that person. Don't confuse this with “putting down” an animal. “To put down” a n animal means to kill the animal. We’re not talking about killing anyone here . Not yet.

Lucy says that Richard “always has to be right.” So meone who “always has to be right” always has to be the person who is correct i n any situation or any discussion. So, if you are married or have a girlfr iend, for example, you learn very quickly that your wife or girlfriend is always righ t. If you don't learn that quickly, you won't have a wife or girlfriend for a very long  time. Well, back to the story. I say that Richard “sounds a little immature.” “To be  immature” (immature) is to be not mature. “To be mature” means to be grown-up, to  be an adult, to act responsibly like an adult, like a person who is old er. “To be immature” means to act like a child – not to do things that you would expect from someone over the age of 18 or 21.

Lucy says, “Yeah, I think it's partly that.” That's  part of the reason. She says, “He doesn't know how to be diplomatic with people.” “To  be diplomatic” (diplomatic) means to be polite, to be nice, to be sensitive, to  be able to talk to people in a way that everyone is happy – in a way that doesn't anger anyone. That’s to be diplomatic. The adjective comes from the noun “dipl omat,” who is a person who goes, usually, to another country, representing his  or her own country. An “ambassador” would be an example of a diplomat.

Well, unfortunately, Richard is not very diplomatic , according to Lucy. I say, “He doesn't know how, or he doesn't want to?” What I'm saying here is that, is it the case that Richard doesn't know how to be diplomatic , or that he knows how but he doesn't want to be diplomatic?

Lucy says, “I don't know, but I do know that someti mes he really gets the better of me.” “To get the better (better) of” someone mea ns to defeat them, to win against them. That would be “to get the better of s omeone.” A situation could get the better of you. This heat is getting the better of me. It's making me tired and hot and angry. Well, not angry. Sometimes heat make s people angry, though – at least, it doesn't help. Cold can also make people a ngry.

 I continue by saying, “Well, he sounds pretty hard to get along with.” I'm saying that Richard appears to be a person who is difficul t to get along with, to be friends with, to work with. I then ask, “Are the ot her people in your group feeling the same way?” Do they have the same opinion? Lucy says, “Yeah,” which is an informal way of saying yes. “In fact, they're fed u p with him.” ”To be fed (fed) up with” someone is a phrasal verb meaning to be tired  of someone – to be bothered or annoyed by a person or situation. You d on't want to tolerate it anymore. You can't take it anymore, we might say.

Lucy says the other people in her group are “fed up  with Richard.” She says, “I keep having to run interference when our discussion s get too heated.” “To run interference” means to try to prevent people from f ighting, to calm people down who are arguing about something, especially people who may be difficult to deal with. When we say a discussion gets “heated” (heate d), we mean it becomes intense. It becomes an argument with strong emotion s that people begin to express – maybe people are yelling at each other, s houting at each other.

Lucy says, “Actually, I feel really sorry for the g uy.” “To feel sorry for” someone means to feel upset for someone because of the situ ation that person is in. If I feel sorry for you, I am empathetic. I am thinking about you and understanding that you are going through a difficult situation. L ucy says, “Richard doesn't seem to have too many friends” – that is, very many frie nds. I say, “Well, I think you're helping just by putting up with him.” “To put up wi th” someone or some situation means to tolerate – to accept – a situation even th ough you're not very happy about it.

At the end of the dialogue, Lucy then thanks me. Sh e says, “Thanks for trying to make me feel better. Okay, now what were you saying ?” She's asking me to repeat what I was saying to her at the beginning of  the dialogue.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: So, does that sound okay with you?

Lucy: What? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you s aid.

Jeff: You seem preoccupied today. What's up?

Lucy: Oh, it's this guy I know from this class I'm taking. His name is Richard. I think I've mentioned him before.

Jeff: Yeah, sure, the guy you're working on a proje ct with, right?

Lucy: Yeah, that's him. The four of us are supposed  to be working as a team on this project, and I'm having a lot of trouble deali ng with him.

Lucy: Well, he doesn't know how to express his opin ion without putting other people down. And, he always has to be right.

Jeff: He sounds a little immature.

Lucy: Yeah, I think it's partly that. He doesn't kn ow how to be diplomatic with people.

# Getting a Haircut

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 48 – Getting a Haircut.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 48. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we’re going to discuss going to ge t a haircut. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

I have an appointment with my hairdresser today. It  has been too long since I had my hair cut. My bangs were too long. I had spli t ends and my roots were showing. I was a mess!

I arrived for my appointment, and I told the recept ionist that I was there for an appointment with Mark. She told me that he was fini shing up with another client and that he would be with me soon. About 10 minutes  later, he came over to where I was sitting and took me back to his station .

Mark: Hi, how have you been? You're looking good.

Lucy: Thanks. I've been great. Thanks for fitting m e in today.

Mark: No problem. So, tell me, what do you want to have done today?

Lucy: I need a trim.

Mark: Okay. Let's see, how short do you want me to cut it? Shoulder length? Chin length?

Lucy: I'd like to take it up about two inches in the back, and the bangs should fall just under my eyebrows.

Mark: Okay, I really think that's a good length for  your face shape.

Just as I had hoped, Mark did a great job with my h air. I paid the receptionist and made sure I gave him a big tip. Anyone who can do w onders with my crazy hair definitely deserves it!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Lucy telling us that she has an appointment with her hairdresser today. A “hairdresser” (hairdresser) is  a person who cuts and colors and does other things with your hair. “Hairdresser”  is a somewhat older name. Nowadays, you will hear the term “stylist” (stylist ) to describe what a hairdresser does.

There's also the term “barber” (barber). A “barber”  is usually someone who cuts only men's hair. A “barber” isn't normally associat ed with the person who cuts a woman's hair. “Hairdresser” or “stylist” could be a ssociated with either a man or a woman. Traditionally, it was associated only with w omen. My mother used to go to a “hairdresser” every . . . I don't know, two we eks, a month, I don't remember – to get her hair done: to cut it, to perhaps do some thing with the color, to do whatever hairdressers do with women's hair.

Lucy says, “It has been too long since I had my hai r cut. My bangs were too long.” Your “bangs” (bangs) are the hairs that hang  in the front of your head over your forehead, usually stopping before your eyes. I f your bangs don't stop before your eyes then you, of course, can't see. Lucy says  her bangs were too long. She says, “I had split ends and my roots were showing. I was a mess!” “Split ends” (ends) is a situation where the ends of your hair a re damaged and they divide into two separate pieces when they should just be o ne piece. This is something, again, I think women worry about more than men, but  apparently it doesn't make your hair look very good when you have split ends.

Lucy says she has split ends. “And,” she says, “my roots were showing.” “Roots” (roots) here refers to the part of your hair that is right next to your head, right next to your scalp, which is the top of your head. It's the point at which the hair grows out of your head. If you dye your hair – if you col or your hair, as many women do, and some men who don't want people to see their gra y hair – you will eventually see that the original color of your hair will begin  to show because, of course, the hair grows and new hair that grows out of your head  won't be the color of the hair that had been dyed or colored. That's the problem t hat Lucy is having.

Lucy told the receptionist that she was “there for an appointment with Mark.” The “receptionist” would be the person who works at the  front of the “salon” (salon), which is a place where hairdressers work. The “rece ptionist” is the person who makes appointments for customers and usually takes their money at the end of the haircut. The receptionist was told by Lucy that  she was there for an appointment with Mark.

The receptionist told Lucy he was “finishing up wit h another client” and that he would be with her soon. “To finish up” is a phrasal  verb meaning to be at the end of some task that you’re performing – to be almost done, but not quite done. “I'm just finishing up my project.” I'm just completing it. I'm not finished with it. It's not complete, but it is almost complete. That's the ide a of “to finish up.”

Mark is finishing up with another client. The word “client” (client) here just means a customer, usually a customer who pays for some se rvice – something that is done to them or for them. A “customer” is a more ge neral term that would be used, for example, if you were going in to buy some thing like a car or a cup of coffee. That would be a case where we would use “cu stomer.”

Lucy continues the story. She says, “About 10 minut es later, he came over to where I was sitting and took me back to his station .” So, Mark walked over to where Lucy was sitting and took her to his station.  “Station” here refers to an area where someone works inside of a hair salon, in side of what we used to call, at least for women, a “beauty parlor” (parlor). But  they don't call them “beauty parlors” anymore. Now they're called “salons,” whic h I guess sounds better.

Mark says to Lucy, “Hi, how have you been? You’re l ooking good.” Lucy says, “Thanks! I've been great. Thanks for fitting me in today.” “To fit someone in” is a phrasal verb that means to make time for someone. I f you have a busy schedule and someone wants to have an appointment with you, you may decide to fit them in. “I have a little time between my nine o'clock a ppointment and my ten o'clock appointment. I’ll fit you in at 9:45.” Mark is bein g thanked by Lucy for fitting her into his schedule today to have her hair cut.

Mark says, “No problem,” meaning it's not a problem . “So, tell me, what do you want to have done today?” Lucy says, “I need a trim .” A “trim” (trim) is a haircut that removes a small amount of hair from the bottom  of your hair, if you will, without changing the actual style of the hair. When  you trim your hair, you're not cutting off very much hair. You're just cutting off  a little bit to make it look better. Mark says, “Okay. Let's see, how short do you want me to cut it? Shoulder length? Chin length?” Mark is asking Lucy how much hair he should cut.

Lucy is being asked if she wants it shoulder length  or chin length. “Shoulder length” means that your hair would go down and stop  at your shoulder. Again, this is something we would normally talk about for a woman getting her hair cut, although, of course, there are men now who have hai r down to their shoulders. My brother had hair down to his shoulders, but that  was back in the 1970s. I guess it was more common then. Mark also gives Lucy  the option of “chin

length.” Your “chin” (chin) is the bottom of your f ace, basically. It's where your jaw is, right below your mouth, or the bottom of your m outh.

Lucy says, “I'd like to take it up about two inches  in the back, and the bangs should fall just under my eyebrows.” “To take somet hing up,” when we’re talking about haircuts, means to make it shorter, to remove  the length. We also use this phrasal verb in talking about a pair of pants that need to be shortened or a skirt that needs to be shortened. You can take it up a fe w inches. That expression is used with hair to describe how much should be cut f rom the hair. “To take something up” can also mean to start an activity. “ I'm going to take up playing the violin.” I'm going to start this new hobby, this ne w activity. In this case, however, it just means to shorten.

Lucy wants her bangs to fall just under her eyebrow s. Her “eyebrows” are, of course, the little strips of hair that are above he r eyes. She wants her bangs to stop at her eyebrows. Mark says, “Okay. I really th ink that's a good length for your face shape” – for the form or shape of your fa ce. Of course, Mark has to say that because he's getting paid by Lucy. Lucy ends the story by saying, “Just as I had hoped” – just as I had wanted – “Mark did a gre at job with my hair.”

Lucy says, “I paid the receptionist and made sure I  gave him a big tip.” A “tip” (tip) is extra money you give someone who's done a good job, who’s given you good service. It's very common to tip your hairstyl ists or hairdresser or barber. She says, “Anyone who can do wonders with my crazy hair definitely deserves it.” She’s saying that Mark deserves extra money. H e deserves a tip because he's done such a great job with her crazy hair. “Cr azy” here doesn't mean mentally insane. “Crazy” just means difficult to co ntrol or difficult to work with.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I have an appointment with my hairdresser today. It  has been too long since I had my hair cut. My bangs were too long. I had spli t ends and my roots were showing. I was a mess!

I arrived for my appointment, and I told the recept ionist that I was there for an appointment with Mark. She told me that he was fini shing up with another client and that he would be with me soon. About 10 minutes  later, he came over to where I was sitting and took me back to his station .

Mark: Hi, how have you been? You're looking good.

 Lucy: Thanks. I've been great. Thanks for fitting m e in today.

Mark: No problem. So, tell me, what do you want to have done today?

Lucy: I need a trim.

Mark: Okay. Let's see, how short do you want me to cut it? Shoulder length? Chin length?

Lucy: I'd like to take it up about two inches in the back, and the bangs should fall just under my eyebrows.

Mark: Okay, I really think that's a good length for  your face shape.

Just as I had hoped, Mark did a great job with my h air. I paid the receptionist and made sure I gave him a big tip. Anyone who can do w onders with my crazy hair definitely deserves it!

# Preparing a Paper (for School)

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 49 – Preparing a Paper for School.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 49. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to hear a conversation  between a student and his teacher. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Student: I wonder if I could ask you some questions  about our paper, Professor. Do you want us to cite our sources in the footnotes ?

Professor: You should use endnotes for longer expla nations. Otherwise, just follow the style sheet I passed out for citations i n your paper.

Student: I see. And what about the cover page? Is there a special format for that as well?

Professor: Do you have the handout I passed out wit h you? If you look at the bottom of that, you'll see that you should follow the format of the American Psychological Association, fifth edition.

Student: Okay, I guess I missed that.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the student saying to the professor, “I wonder if I could ask you some questions about our paper, Professor.”  A “professor” is a teacher at a college or university. We are listening to a d ialogue between a student and a professor. We guess that the student has gone to ta lk to the professor after class or in her office.

The student says, “I wonder if.” That expression “I  wonder if” is a polite phrase used to introduce a topic or to ask permission to d o something. You might say to your boss, “I wonder if I could leave early this af ternoon, because I have a doctor’s appointment.” You are asking nicely and po litely. The student is being polite to the professor, as students should be.

 He says, “Do you want us to cite our sources in the  footnotes?” The student is asking about a paper – an essay, a written paper th at the professor has given the class. The student asks the professor if she wants them to cite their sources. “To cite” (cite) means to state or to say where you fou nd a certain piece of information. You are providing what we would call the “source” of the information – where you got it from.

So, if you are writing a paper for school and you make some statement about the topic, often the professor will ask you to cite you r sources. “Where did you read that?” “What book did you read that in?” Or, “What article did you find that in?” Nowadays, it might be, “What website was that on?” Note that “cite” sounds the exact same as “sight,” which refers to your ability  to see. We’re not talking about that kind of sight; we’re talking about “cite” as a  verb meaning to name or to give details about where you got information.

A “footnote” (footnote) is a little note on the bot tom of the piece of paper that you are writing your article on. We call that the “foot er.” That's the bottom of the paper. The top of the paper is called the “header” (header), just like your head is the top of your body and your feet are at the botto m of your body. Well, at the bottom of the page, you can have a “footnote.”

It's a small note, usually with a little number on it that corresponds to a number somewhere in the main article in the main text. A “ footnote” gives you additional information about what you are talking about, or it  gives you the source of the information. Another word for a “source” in this ca se would be a “citation” (citation). A “citation” is when you list the sourc e of your information.

Going back to our dialogue, then, we have the stude nt asking the professor if he has to “cite” his sources in the footnotes. The pro fessor says, “You should use endnotes for longer explanations.” The professor is  saying that instead of putting the notes at the bottom of each page, she wants the m at the end of the entire paper. When the notes are at the end of the paper, we call them “endnotes” instead of “footnotes,” which makes sense, I guess,  since they’re at the end.

The professor says, “Otherwise, just follow the sty le sheet I passed out for citations in your paper.” At the university and in other places that publish things, you have a style sheet that tells you how you are g oing to write and format the things that you are publishing or printing. In a un iversity, each academic department has a style sheet that it follows. There  are a couple of popular style books that are used. There is the Chicago style. Th ere is the American

Psychological Association or “APA” style. Different  academic areas use different style books, or different styles.

A “style sheet” would be a piece of paper or severa l pieces of paper that indicate how you should format the paper – where you should put the title, where you should put the footnotes or how the footnotes shoul d be formatted, and so forth. The professor is telling the student to follow the style sheet she “passed out.” “To pass out” means to give, especially when a professo r or teacher gives things to her students. You can also pass out pieces of paper  to a large group of people even though you're not in school. It's not a phrasa l verb we use only in school.

A “citation,” as I mentioned earlier, is a written statement explaining where you got your information. The student says, “I see” – m eaning “I understand” – “and what about the cover page? Is there a special forma t for that as well?” This is not a very intelligent student, since the professor jus t told him to look on the style sheet. I think the professor should fail the studen t right now. Give him an F. He's just not good enough, not smart enough, to be in th is class.

So, the idiot student is asking about the cover pag e. The “cover page” is the top sheet of paper that goes in front of your essay. It  usually lists the title, the author or the person who wrote the essay, and other basic kinds of information. In a class, it would include perhaps the name of the pro fessor and the class that the student is in. The student is asking about the form at of the cover sheet. The “format” is the form or the style in which the cove r sheet or any other part of the paper is written.

The professor says, “Do you have the handout I pass ed out with you?” A “handout” (handout) is a piece of paper that a – ty pically, a professor or teacher gives to her students, that has information about w hat you are supposed to do. The term “handout,” as a noun, more generally can m ean any kind of written information that is given to a group of people in a  meeting or any other sort of situation where you are giving information to peopl e on paper. The student is asked if he has the handout the professor passed ou t with him. That is, did he bring it with him? Does he have it there in the pro fessor's office? (If that's where we are.)

The professor says, “If you look at the bottom of t hat, you'll see that you should follow the format of the American Psychological Ass ociation, 5th Edition.” Remember we talked earlier about different kinds of  style books or style sheets. One of them used in many different areas of the uni versity is the APA or American Psychological Association style sheet or s tylebook. The more technical term actually would be “style manual.”

 The student is asked if he has the sheet – the hand out that the professor passed out or gave to the students. The student says, “Oka y, I guess I missed that.” “To miss” something, as a verb, means not to see it, no t to notice it. The student, of course, didn't look carefully, and therefore missed  the information that the professor is talking about.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Student: I wonder if I could ask you some questions  about our paper, Professor. Do you want us to cite our sources in the footnotes ?

Professor: You should use endnotes for longer expla nations. Otherwise, just follow the style sheet I passed out for citations i n your paper.

Student: I see. And what about the cover page? Is there a special format for that as well?

Professor: Do you have the handout I passed out wit h you? If you look at the bottom of that, you'll see that you should follow the format of the American Psychological Association, fifth edition.

Student: Okay, I guess I missed that.

We’d like thank our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Luc y Tse, for her wonderful scripts, and we’d like to thank you for listening.

# Reading Magazines

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 50 – Reading Magazines.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 50. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode we're going to discuss reading a ma gazine. Let’s get started.  > I'm the first to admit that I'm hooked on reading m agazines. I've been this way as long as I can remember. I love picking up magazines  about different topics. Currently, I subscribe to about six or seven magazi nes, although when I was getting professional journals during my days at the  university, I probably had 15 or 20 coming to my box every month.
> Now I read mostly for pleasure. I like to read The New Yorker  because it is so well written. I also get a copy of Atlantic Monthly  and Harper’s  every month because they have good coverage of cultural, politi cal, and social issues. My latest is to read book reviews. There are a couple of really good book reviews published in the U.S., including The New York Revie w of Books .
> But the best reviews for my money are The Times Lit erary Supplement  and the London Review of Books , both of which come out of England. I have to Thank my friend Gustavo for turning me on to those two. I pr efer to read the nonfiction reviews over the fiction ones, but that's me. Ah, the joys of reading!

This is a story about reading magazines. I begin by  saying that “I’m the first to admit that I'm hooked on reading magazines.” The ex pression “the first to admit” means I'm the first person who is willing to say. W e use this expression when we are talking about something, perhaps, that isn’t ve ry desirable – some bad habit that we have. We might also use this expression whe n we are saying something that perhaps is embarrassing or that we don't norma lly want to talk about. It's not for something serious. It's usually for something t hat isn't very important.

Here, I'm saying I'm the first to admit that I'm “h ooked on reading magazines.” “To be hooked (hooked) on” something means to be ad dicted to something or to

be obsessed with something. We can talk about someo ne being “hooked on heroin” or “hooked on cocaine.” That means they hav e an addiction to those drugs. So, now you can see that “to be hooked on” s omething is a somewhat negative idea, and that goes well with the expressi on “I'm the first to admit.” Of course, being hooked on reading magazines isn't the  same as being hooked on drugs.

“I've been this way,” I continue, “as long as I can  remember.” The expression “as long as I can remember” means as far back as I can remember. It's a phrase we use to show that we can't remember a time when this  wasn't true. I say, “I love picking up magazines about different topics.” “To p ick up” means often to buy, although it could just mean to pick it up with your  hand, to grab it with your hand. I say, “I love picking up magazines about different  topics” – different areas.

“Currently, I subscribe to about six or seven magaz ines.” “To subscribe” (subscribe) means to sign up to receive something –  to say, “Yes, I would like to get this on a regular basis.” You subscribe to this  podcast; you get each new issue or each new episode. You subscribe to a newsp aper or to a magazine, and when you do, you get each issue of that newspaper o r magazine.

I continue by saying, “Although when I was getting professional journals during my days at the university, I probably had 15 or 20 coming to my box each month.” A “professional journal” (journal) is a mag azine written by experts on a certain topic, usually designed for or written for people who are researchers or professors in that particular area of study. I say I used to get many of these “during my days at the university,” meaning during the time that I was working at the university. I say, “I probably had 15 or 20 com ing to my box,” meaning my mailbox, “every month.”

“Now I read mostly for pleasure,” I say. “To read f or pleasure” means to read for enjoyment – not to read in order to get information , necessarily, or at least not to read something for your work or for school, but sim ply because you want to read it. I say, “I like to read The New Yorker  because it is so well written.” When we say something is “well written,” we mean it is writ ten in such a way that is interesting. It is written in such a way that we kn ow this person has a lot of talent and skill. It's enjoyable to read.

“I also get a copy of Atlantic Monthly  and Harper’s  every month,” I say, “because they have good coverage of cultural, political, and  social issues.” The word “coverage” (coverage) means with reports or informa tion about a certain topic. We could talk about the movie coverage or the enter tainment industry coverage in the Los Angeles Times  newspaper. When we say “coverage,” we’re referring

to the stories that are written about that topic. I f you say a newspaper has good coverage of a certain area, you mean they have good  writers and reporters who explain and talk about and write stories about that  particular area.

I then say, “My latest is to read book reviews.” Wh en someone says “my latest,” they mean “the most recent or newest thing that I h ave started doing.” It could be a good thing. It could be a bad thing. “My latest is to read book reviews” – articles written about books that have recently been publish ed, usually. We use the term “book review” for this particular kind of magazine that is about books that have been written recently. A “review” is someone's opin ion about something.

You could have “movie reviews.” You can have “book reviews.” You could have reviews, I guess, of apps for your mobile phone or for your computer. Here, we’re talking about reviews or opinions about books. The magazine is called a “book review.” “Book reviews” are also popular in newspap ers, especially on Sunday. In the United States, the newspapers on Sunday are alw ays bigger, always “thicker,” we would say. They have more sections in  them, and one section that's very common in many newspapers is a book review.

I say that there are a couple of really good book r eviews published in the U.S. “But,” I say, “the best reviews for my money are the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books .” The expression “for my money” means that if I'm going to spend money on something, this is the best option for me. This is where you will get the most for your money, in othe r words. “For my money, the best hot dogs in Los Angeles can be purchased at Pi nk’s,” which is a little restaurant in the middle part of Los Angeles – very  famous for people who live here in Los Angeles.

When I say “for my money,” I mean if I'm going to s pend money, I'm going to spend it there because I'm going to get the best de al there. I’m going to get the most for my money. For my money, the best book revi ews are published not here in the United States, but in England. I say they “c ome out of England.” “To come out of” means to come from, to be created in a cert ain location.

I continue by saying, “I have to thank my friend Gu stavo for turning me on to those two” – those two book reviews. “To turn someo ne on to” something means to get someone interested in something. Don't confu se this with another, more dangerous, phrasal verb expression, “to turn someon e on.” “To turn someone on” means to get someone sexually interested or excited . We're not talking about that. We’re talking about getting someone simply in terested in a new topic or a new thing.

I end the story by saying, “I prefer to read the no nfiction reviews over the fiction ones, but that's me.” “Nonfiction” refers to books about things that are true, that contain true information or facts. “Fiction” refers  to books about imaginary stories, things that someone made up. I also use the express ion here, “that's me,” meaning that's the way I look at things. Grammatica lly, it should be “that’s I,” but we never say that. We say, “That's me.”

Finally, I say, “The joys of reading!” I’m talking about how wonderful it is to read. The word “joys” here refers to the pleasures, the g ood things you get from reading.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.  > I'm the first to admit that I'm hooked on reading m agazines. I've been this way as long as I can remember. I love picking up magazines  about different topics. Currently, I subscribe to about six or seven magazi nes, although when I was getting professional journals during my days at the  university, I probably had 15 or 20 coming to my box every month.

# Eating Fast Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 51 – Eating Fast Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 51. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss eating at a  fast food restaurant. Let's get started. > My friend Julia called me the other day. She wanted  to grab some lunch and asked me if I wanted to go to the local fast food p lace down the street. I said sure, even though I knew it wouldn't be good for me . I hopped in my car and swung by to pick her up at her work. When we go t to the restaurant, there was already a long line at the drive-through. It wa s the lunch hour, so that is to be expected.
> We inched forward in the driveway and finally reach ed the order station. "Welcome to McApple's Restaurant. How can I help yo u today?" I leaned over to shout into the little box, "Uh, I'll have a cheeseb urger, and my friend will take a regular hamburger." "Would you like anything to d rink with that?" she asked. She had a very low voice. "Two Diet Cokes, please,"  I said. "And would you like any fries with that?" she asked again. "No, just the hamburgers, thanks." "That'll be $8.75. Please pull forward."
> We drove up to the pick-up window and paid the cash ier. Our food was ready about 30 seconds later. "Thank you!" I said as we d rove away. We pulled over to the side of the road to eat our hamburgers. I knew I was going to regret it, but it sure did taste good!

I told the story about going to a fast food restaur ant. A “fast food restaurant” is one where you get your food really fast. McDonald’s , for example, is a famous American fast food restaurant. I said that my frien d Julia called me “the other day.” The expression “the other day” just means som e day recently, within the last perhaps week or two. She said she “wanted to g rab some lunch.” “To grab,”

you probably know, means to reach out your hand to pick something up. But here, “to grab some lunch” means to go and eat lunc h, to go to get your lunch.

I said I “hopped in my car.” “To hop” normally mean s to jump up and down like a bunny rabbit. We say “The bunny rabbit jumped” – or  “hopped” – “up and down.” A kangaroo, like you would find in Australia, hops.  But when we use the expression “I hopped in my car,” we don’t mean that  we actually jump, but that we got into our car fairly quickly – right away – i n order to drive away.

I said that I “swung by” to pick my friend up. “To swing by” means to go to that place. We use this expression a lot. “When you are coming from work, dear, would you swing by the grocery store and buy me som e chicken?” – meaning “I want you to stop at the grocery store and get some chicken. If you don’t, you won’t eat tonight.” So, I do.

I was going to “pick her up” which is, of course, I  was going to have her come with me in my car. When we got to the restaurant, there was “a long line at the drive-through.” A “drive-through restaurant” is a r estaurant where you can stay in your car. You don’t even have to leave your car. Yo u can pull up to a little driveway, or a little place where cars go, and you can order your food and pay for your food. It’s called a “drive-through restaurant. ” Not all fast food restaurants have a drive-through, but most drive-through restau rants are fast food restaurants.

I said that it was “the lunch hour,” meaning, of co urse, it was around noon, which is when Americans eat their lunch. I said that “we inched forward in the driveway.” “To inch forward” means to move very slo wly, inch by inch. So, we “inched forward” and we “finally reached the order station,” and that’s the place where they have the menu of the items for the resta urant and a little box that you have to shout into to place or to give your order.

The woman at the restaurant said, “Welcome to McApp le’s Restaurant.” “Welcome to” is a very common thing that you would say to someone who is entering a restaurant or is coming into a store. I said that I “leaned over.” “To lean” (lean) means to bend over, to take your body and bend it down towards the ground. Here, “I leaned over” means that I went ove r the side of my car in order to talk into the little box.

I said, “I’ll have a cheeseburger, and my friend wi ll take a regular hamburger.” When we are ordering at a restaurant, the most comm on expression is to say, “I’ll have a . . .” and then what you want. You can also say “I will take the filet mignon and the shrimp” –  because I’m a very big eater. Th at is the expression we use,

then: “I’ll have” or “I will take.” I said that the  cashier “had a very low voice.” A “low voice” is someone who speaks down here, and a “high voice” is someone who speaks up here. I don’t have a high voice or a low voice, I don’t think.

The cashier told me (that) “That’ll be $8.75.” When  someone is telling you how much money you owe them – at a store, sometimes at a restaurant – they’ll use the expression “that will be.” “That will be $575 to fix your car, please.” That is the expression. It means “this is how much you have to pay me or give me.” She told us, at the restaurant, to “pull forward.” “To pull forward” just means to move your car up forward – going a little bit farther. We use  this expression usually for cars, automobiles: “Please pull forward.” You’ll hear tha t in a fast food – or drive- through, rather – restaurant. It usually refers to cars.

I said that we “drove up to the pick-up window and paid the cashier.” “To drive up” really just means to drive to a place. Once aga in, it’s that use of the preposition to emphasize the word. “We drove up to Sacramento” is the same as saying “We drove to Sacramento,” but it gives it a little more emphasis. The “pick-up window,” you can guess, is the place where  you pick up or get your food in a fast food restaurant. In some fast food restau rants, you have a cashier that you pay in one window or one place, and then you mo ve forward or pull forward a couple of feet and there is someone to give you y our food.

After we got our food, I said that we “drove away.”  “To drive away” means to drive away from a certain place. It is always relat ed to where you are going from. “She drove away from my house and left” means she w as at my house and now she is leaving my house. I said that we “pulled ove r to the side of the road to eat our hamburgers.” “To pull over” means to stop – to get out of the street or the lane where you are driving and to stop. The “side of the road” means the place where you can park a car or stop a car in a street.

Finally, I said that I “was going to regret it,” bu t the hamburger “sure did taste good.” “To regret” something means that you wish yo u would not have done it. I wish I didn’t eat all those french fries. Now I fee l very sleepy. The expression “it sure did taste good” – “sure” here (sure) – sure me ans . . . is another way of emphasizing. “It sure was hot yesterday” means it w as really hot yesterday.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

My friend Julia called me the other day. She wanted  to grab some lunch and asked me if I wanted to go to the local fast food p lace down the street. I said

sure, even though I knew it wouldn't be good for me . I hopped in my car and swung by to pick her up at her work. When we go t to the restaurant, there was already a long line at the drive-through. It wa s the lunch hour, so that is to be expected.

We inched forward in the driveway and finally reach ed the order station. "Welcome to McApple's Restaurant. How can I help yo u today?" I leaned over to shout into the little box, "Uh, I'll have a cheeseb urger, and my friend will take a regular hamburger." "Would you like anything to d rink with that?" she asked. She had a very low voice. "Two Diet Cokes, please,"  I said. "And would you like any fries with that?" she asked again. "No, just the hamburgers, thanks." "That'll be $8.75. Please pull forward."

We drove up to the pick-up window and paid the cash ier. Our food was ready about 30 seconds later. "Thank you!" I said as we d rove away. We pulled over to the side of the road to eat our hamburgers. I knew I was going to regret it, but it sure did taste good!

# Preparing for a Business Trip

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 52 – Preparing for a Business Trip.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 52. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss taking a bu siness trip. Let's get started. > I'm going to a conference this weekend back in my h ome state of Minnesota. I am going there to address a convention full of libr arians, believe it or not. For me, the worst part of going on the road for business is  not the traveling; it's all the preparation you have to do. I created a whole check list of things I have to do when I travel.
> First, I confirm that my flight will be on time dep arting from LAX. Next, I call to double-check on my reservation for the hotel and  the rent-a-car. After that, I pull out my suitcase and start packing. I'm a lig ht packer, so I bring only the pants, shirts, socks, and underwear I'm going to ne ed, nothing more. I throw in my toiletries bag with the usual stuff – shaver,  shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss – and then I'm just about don e.
> Finally, I go through my briefcase to make sure I h ave all the things I'll need for the conference: my badge, my laptop, my overhead tr ansparencies, a notepad, and some pens. Now I'm ready. Off I go to my old ho me.

I talked about preparing for a business trip I have  to take. I said I am “going to a conference this weekend back in my home state of Mi nnesota.” A “conference” is a large meeting of people interested in the same subject or topic. You can have a conference for automobile makers, or a conference of teachers, or a conference of doctors. Anything that you can talk about and ha ve presentations about, you can have a conference.

I said that I was going this weekend to this confer ence “back in my home state.” To say “back in” is just to say “in my home state,”  but it sort of implies that you have moved to another place and now you are going b ack to that place. So, I

lived in Minnesota. I now live in California. I can  go “back” to Minnesota to visit. And, of course, since I was born and raised, or gre w up, in Minnesota, it is my “home state.” It is the state where I was born.

I’m going there “to address a convention.” “To addr ess” means to talk to, to give a presentation to. “I am now going to address the s tudents” means I’m going to give them a presentation or talk to them all as one  big group. This convention – and “convention” is here really just another word f or a conference – this convention is a librarian convention. “Librarians,”  of course, are the people who take care of books and other things in a library.

And I said I’m going there, “believe it or not.” “B elieve it or not” is an expression we use when we are telling someone something that they may not believe or that is very unusual. “Believe it or not, it actually sn owed in Los Angeles once.” I just made that up. I don’t know if that’s true. But that  would be certainly a good place to say “believe it or not.” I said, “The worst part  of going on the road for business is not the traveling.” “On the road” is an expressi on that we use to say “traveling.” “I’m on the road this week” means I am traveling th is week, usually for some business purpose.

I said that I “created a whole checklist.” A “check list” is a list of things that you have to do or that you need to make sure are done. “To check” something, you probably know, means to investigate, but here it me ans to put a little “x” or a little . . . what we call a “check mark,” which is sort of  like a “v” but with one very short side and one very long side. A “checklist” is a lis t of things that we “check off,” which is to say, if I have a checklist of things to  do, after I do it I can “check it off,” meaning I can put a little “x” indicating that I’m done.

The use of the word “whole” here (whole) – “I creat ed a whole checklist.” This is a common, informal way that we talk about something  that is bigger or more work than you expected, or is something more than you th ought. For example, “My sister called me the other day and she gave me this  whole story about how her friend . . . ,” and so on and so forth. “Gave me th is whole story,” meaning it was a long story. So, anything that seems to be greater t han or more than we expect, we can sometimes use that expression. It’s an infor mal expression, for the most part.

I said that I “confirm [that] my flight will be on time departing from LAX.” Lots of things there: “To confirm your flight” means to cal l up the airline and make sure that your plane is going to leave “on time” – the t ime that it’s supposed to leave. “Your flight” is the plane that you’re going to go in, and “departing” just means to leave. There are departing flights and arriving fli ghts. The noun would be

“departures.” Those are the flights that are leavin g the airport, and “arrivals” are the flights or planes that are arriving or coming to the airport.

I said I called “to double-check on my reservation for the hotel and the rent-a- car.” “To double-check” means that I’m checking aga in. I want to be very sure that they have my reservation. So, I’m going to dou ble-check it. I already checked it last week. I’m going to check or investi gate it this week – that’s double-checking. A “rent-a-car” is the same as a “r ental car.” “Rent-a-car,” “rental car” – it’s the same.

I said, “I pull out my suitcase and start packing.”  “To pull out” implies that it was stored somewhere in my closet and I have to take it  out or pull it out – remove it. My “suitcase,” of course, is where you put your clo thes and other things when you go on a trip so that they all stay in one place , especially if you are going on an airplane. “To pack” means to put things in your suitcase in order to leave. We also use this verb “to pack” if you are moving from  one house or one apartment to another. You have to pack your things. You have to put them all in boxes or something that you can move them easily with. I sai d I’m “a light packer,” which means I don’t like to pack or put very many things in my suitcase.

I said that I was going to “throw in my toiletries bag.” “To throw in” means literally to take something up, pick something up, and throw it. But here, “to throw in” means to put in my suitcase. “Toiletries” is a gene ral term that refers to all the sort of things you might find in a bathroom that yo u would need and you can take with you – shaving cream, toothbrush, shampoo, toot hpaste. All of these could be called “toiletries.” One of the toiletries I’m b ringing is “floss” (floss). “Floss” is like a little piece of string that you use in betwe en your teeth to get the food out.

I said that I “go through my briefcase” to make sur e I have all the things I need. My “briefcase” is a place where a businessperson ca rries their papers and their computer, perhaps. This little bag is called a “bri efcase” if it’s used in a business setting or business situation.

If you’re going to a convention or a conference, us ually they give you a “badge” (badge). A “badge” is a little piece of paper, usua lly inside a plastic holder, and it has your name on it, and it’s like a ticket for you  to get into the conference. And conferences and conventions always – almost always – have badges that people wear so you can also see what their name is and say , “Oh, you’re the guy that called me last week and wasted my time.” That’s wha t a badge is for.

“Overhead transparency” is a piece of plastic that is clear – in other words, you can see through it – and you write on it, and you p ut it on an “overhead

projector,” which is basically a big lamp with a mi rror that projects or shows what’s on the transparency up on a big screen.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > I'm going to a conference this weekend back in my h ome state of Minnesota. I am going there to address a convention full of libr arians, believe it or not.

# Picking a Wardrobe

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 53 – Picking a Wardrobe.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 53. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss picking clo thes to wear. Let's get started. > I'm one of those people who don't have much of a fa shion sense. I mean, I know that I shouldn't wear a pink shirt with green pants , but beyond that I'm pretty much a basket case when it comes to picking my ward robe.
> I have plenty of short-sleeve and long-sleeve dress  shirts; some have a button- down collar and some have a shirt pocket in them. I  also own some more casual shirts with a collar, and a ton of T-shirts with ju st about every logo you can think of. I have a couple of good pairs of black slacks f or formal occasions, along with khakis and jeans for more informal events.
> Naturally, I have one nice suit to wear to weddings , funerals, and job interviews, with a suit coat, tie, a belt with a nice-looking b uckle, and pants. I also own a sports coat, but I don't use it much. Well, I bet ter stop talking and start dressing. I'm late for work!

Today’s story is about picking a wardrobe. A “wardr obe” – all one word (wardrobe) – means all of the clothing that you can  wear. “I have a very small wardrobe” means I don’t have very many things I can  wear. A wardrobe is all of your clothing that you own. A wardrobe can also mea n a place where you put your clothing – it’s like a tall cabinet. We call t hat a wardrobe as well.

I started by saying that I didn’t have “much of a f ashion sense.” “Fashion,” you probably know, means a kind of clothing. The kind of style that someone has, the way they look, is part of fashion. And a “fashion s ense” (sense) is the ability to know what would be a good look for someone. That’s someone with a good fashion sense. I don’t have a good fashion sense.

I then said, “I mean, I know that you shouldn’t wea r a pink shirt with green pants.” The expression “I mean” at the beginning of the sen tence is a very common conversational, informal way that we sort of fill u p the space when we are talking, fill up time. It’s like “ah” or “um.” Sometimes we use it, however, a little more specifically, to clarify – to make clear – our mean ing. So, I could say to someone, “I’m going to the store. I mean the grocery store d own the street.”

I said that when it comes to fashion, “I’m pretty m uch of a basket case.” “Basket case” usually refers to someone who has mental or e motional problems, and they have so many problems that they can’t do what they are supposed to do in their job or in their work. We use it here kind of in a joking way. I say, “I’m pretty much a basket case when it comes to picking my ward robe,” meaning I’m not very good at it – I can’t do a very good job.

I said I had “short-sleeve and long-sleeve dress shirts.” The sleeve of your shirt is the part that goes on your arms, and you can guess that “short-sleeve shirts” are shirts where the sleeve only goes down part of your  arm, usually just covering your biceps. Your biceps are those muscles that are  in the top part of your upper arm. Those are biceps, and triceps are on the botto m part of your upper arm. “Long-sleeve shirts” are shirts where the sleeve go es down to your wrist. Your wrist is what connects your hand to the rest of you r arm. That part is called your wrist. So, a “long-sleeve shirt” would go down to y our wrist.

I mentioned that I also own some “button-down colla r shirts.” You have buttons on your shirt. Usually you put each button into a l ittle hole called a “buttonhole,” which keeps the shirt from coming off of you or fro m opening in the front. The “collar” is the part of the shirt that goes around your neck, and a “button-down collar” is a collar that has buttons in the front t hat keep it attached to the rest of the shirt. So, a “button-down collar shirt” would b e a shirt with a button-down collar.

I also said that some of my shirts have a “shirt po cket” in them. A “pocket,” like a pocket in your pants, is a little place where you can keep things, where you can hold things. A “shirt pocket” is a place where you can find your glasses, or a pen, or a piece of paper, and so forth – an iPod, perhap s.

I said that I had “a ton of T-shirts with just abou t every logo you can think of.” “T- shirts” – which is just the letter T - (shirts) – “ T-shirts” are shirts that don’t have a collar, that are usually short sleeve, and that are  used for very informal occasions. Or, you sometimes wear a T-shirt underne ath a more formal shirt, usually a white T-shirt. Nowadays, you have T-shirt s that have all sorts of things printed on them, and companies that have their logo s printed on them use them

as advertising. A “logo” is a symbol that a company  uses. For example, the logo for Nike sportswear – (nike), Nike – is a little ch eck mark. That would be a logo.

I used the expression “every logo you can think of. ” This is a common way of saying “lots and lots” of a particular thing. “Ever y person you could think of was there,” meaning everyone that you know was there. S o, lots of people. I said that I have a couple of “pairs of black slacks.” We talk  about pants or “slacks,” and “slacks” is just another word for pants. It’s usual ly more formal pants. We sometimes call those “slacks” (slacks). We always t alk about a “pair” of pants or a “pair” of slacks.

I mentioned that I own some “khakis and jeans.” “Je ans,” you probably know, are usually blue and are made out of a thick cotton mat erial. “Khaki” is a brownish- yellow material that you can make pants, called “kh akis,” out of. And they’re very popular. “Khakis” were originally used for the mili tary, but now anyone can buy pants made from that material.

I said I own “one nice suit.” A “suit” describes pa nts, shirt, and a suit coat – a coat that goes over your shirt – and usually a tie. All those things together are a “suit.” Usually, you’ll also have a “belt,” which is what g oes around the top of your pants and holds them up. It keeps your pants from falling  down. You wouldn’t want that to happen. A belt has a “buckle,” and the buckle is  the part that you use to hold the belt together. It’s in the very front of your p ants.

Finally, I said I own “a sports coat.” A “sports co at” is a jacket or coat that is used for more informal occasions. So, you wouldn’t go to  a wedding or a funeral with a sports coat. You’d use a “suit coat.” A sports coat  is a little less formal.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I'm one of those people who don't have much of a fa shion sense. I mean, I know that I shouldn't wear a pink shirt with green pants , but beyond that I'm pretty much a basket case when it comes to picking my ward robe.

# A Trip to the Jewelry Store

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 54 – A Trip to the Jewelry Store.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 54. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss shopping for jewelry at a jewelry store. Let's get started. > My wife's birthday was coming up and I wanted to ge ther a special present. She always tells me not to splurge on gifts for her, bu t for once, I decided to pull out all the stops.
> I went to the jewelry store and began looking at al l of the display cases. I started by looking at the bracelets. The sales clerk asked me if I was looking for a bangle or a chain bracelet. I told her that I wasn't sure,  and she showed me some in yellow gold, white gold, and platinum. None of them  seemed like my wife's style, so I moved on to the rings.
> The clerk asked me if my wife liked diamonds, and I  told her that she did but that she also liked other stones, like emeralds, rubies,  or sapphires. I looked at a lot of anniversary bands, but none really fit the bill.
> Finally, I walked over to the display case with the  necklaces. There was a pearl necklace with a really beautiful clasp. I had never  seen anything like it before and I was sure my wife was going to like it. I told the  clerk that I would take it.
> The clerk placed the necklace in its box and gift w rapped it. I have to say that when I left the store, I felt pretty proud of mysel f. I knew my wife would like the present, and I picked it out all by myself. Now, I can't wait to see the look on her face when she opens it!

Today we are talking about why I am such a good hus band, because I went to the jewelry store to buy my wife a gift. I said tha t my wife’s birthday was “coming up.” When we say an event or a date “is coming up,”  we mean that it will be here

soon. Sometimes you hear that on the television whe n a person reading the news announces a story that they are going to talk about in a few minutes. They’ll say, “Coming up: a story about birds,” or w hatever the story is.

Anyway, my wife’s birthday was coming up and so I wanted to give her a special “gift,” or “present.” “Gift” and “present” mean the  same thing. My wife always tells me not to “splurge.” “To splurge” (splurge) means to spend a lot of money on something. “I’m going to splurge on dinner tonight and order the filet mignon or the New York steak.” You can splurge on anything: a  television, a computer, even an iPad.

I said that “for once” I decided to “pull out all the stops.” “For once” here means “for this one time.” “For once, I want to see a goo d movie” means this one time, I want to see a good movie. Usually we use this expre ssion when we don’t normally expect to do a certain thing. For example,  “Normally I go jogging every morning, but for once, I’m going to try swimming.” That would be an example of using “for once.”

“To pull out all the stops” means to do the maximum  possible, to do as much as possible. If you throw a party for a friend, and yo u hire an orchestra with dancers and order wine and food, this would be “pulling out  all the stops” – doing the maximum or most that you could do. It would also be  very expensive. Now, the expression “to pull out all the stops” actually com es from music. On an organ, like an organ in a church, the “stops” are things that h elp control the volume of the organ, and pulling them out makes the organ louder.  So, “to pull out all the stops” means to do the most you can do.

I said I went to the “jewelry store,” and the “jewe lry store,” you probably know, is where you buy “jewelry” – things like rings and nec klaces and bracelets and so forth. I started by looking at the “display cases.”  When you walk into a jewelry store, usually there is a counter or a glass case w here they have all of the jewelry. A “case” is like a box where they keep the  jewelry so you can see it but you can’t touch it. A “display case,” then, is a ca se in a store that displays or shows something.

“I started by looking at the bracelets.” “Bracelets ,” you probably know, are things that go around your wrist. Both men and women can w ear bracelets. The sales clerk asked me if I was looking for a “bangle” or a  “chain bracelet.” There are two kinds of bracelets, basically. A “chain bracelet” is made up of little pieces. We call those little pieces of a chain “links” (links). So,  a “chain bracelet” is flexible and it has little pieces that go all around your wrist. A “bangle bracelet” is solid. It’s one piece. You can put it on and it isn’t flexible like  a chain bracelet is.

 The clerk showed me some bracelets “in yellow gold,  white gold, and platinum.” “Yellow gold” is, you could say, normal gold. It’s a gold color. “White gold” is also gold, but it is a silver or a silver-white color. A nd “platinum” is one of the most expensive types of metal. It is also silver-white i n color. Gold, silver, platinum, white gold, yellow gold – these are all “precious m etals.” “Precious” here means somewhat rare, and because they are rare, they are expensive: precious metals.

I decided none of the bracelets were my wife’s “sty le,” or the kind of look that she would like. So, “I moved on,” or I went to look at,  the display case with the rings. “Rings,” of course, are things that you put on your  finger or your toes. We call a ring on your toe a “toe ring.” But if we just say “ ring,” we usually mean for your fingers. When you get married, you put a ring on. R ings have different types of “stones.” Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires – these are all stones that you can put on a ring.

A “diamond” is one of the hardest stones and is ver y expensive. “Emeralds” are green stones, usually. “Rubies” are sort of a red o r purple-red stone. “Sapphires” are usually blue. These are all expensive stones th at you can put on your ring or somewhere else. You also call these “gems” (gems). A “gem” is an expensive stone that’s used usually for jewelry. A “precious gem” or a “precious stone” is like a precious metal – a rare and, therefore, usua lly expensive type of stone.

I said I looked at a lot of “anniversary bands.” A “band” here is another word for a ring, and an “anniversary band” is often just a pla in ring with no stones on it. Usually, in the United States anyway, when a man ge ts married, he gets a “wedding band.” It’s a ring that usually doesn’t ha ve any stones in it, but it can. Mine doesn’t.

I said that none of these really “fit the bill.” Wh en we say something “fits the bill,” we mean it is appropriate, it is correct, it is rig ht for this situation. “To fit the bill” can be used for lots of different things. “I interv iewed three people today, but none of them had sufficient experience – none of th em fit the bill.” None of them was what I was looking for.

I finally went over and looked at the “necklaces.” A “necklace” is a chain that goes around your neck. There was a “pearl necklace. ” “Pearls” are not stones, but they are a very hard substance that you find in  an oyster. If you have an oyster and you open it up, it will often have a pea rl inside. The “pearl necklace” – the necklace made of pearls – that I was looking at  had a “very beautiful clasp.” A “clasp” (clasp) is what you use to connect a neckla ce or sometimes a chain bracelet. It’s usually in the back and usually very  difficult to do, at least for me.

So, that’s the “clasp.” It holds the necklace toget her so you can put it on and take it off easily.

I told the clerk that I “would take” the pearl neck lace. “I would take it.” This is an expression we can use when we buy something. The sa lesperson says, “How do you like this television?” and you say, “That’s a n ice television. I’ll take it,” meaning I want to buy it. The clerk puts the neckla ce in a box and then “gift wrapped it.” “To gift wrap,” as a verb, means to pu t wrapping paper, usually colored paper, on the box to make it look nice. We call that “gift wrapping.”

I said that I was feeling “pretty proud of myself,”  which means I thought I did a good job, because I picked out the gift “all by mys elf,” meaning with no one else helping me. I ended by saying, “I can’t wait to see  the look on her face when she opens it.” When we say “the look on your face,” usu ally it’s because you are surprised or you’re scared. For example, “I threw a  surprise birthday party for my friend. You should’ve seen the look on his face whe n he came in the door and everyone yelled, ‘Surprise!’” That would be an exam ple of using this expression.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

My wife's birthday was coming up and I wanted to ge ther a special present. She always tells me not to splurge on gifts for her, bu t for once, I decided to pull out all the stops.

present, and I picked it out all by myself. Now, I can't wait to see the look on her face when she opens it!

# A Family Party

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 55 – A Family Party.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 55. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss attending a  family party. Let's get started. > I visit my hometown about once a year. This year, I  was in town for about five days and there was a family get-together. It wasn't  a family reunion since it was just my immediate family, but still, there was a to tal of about 45 people who showed up.
> Our family parties are always held at the home of o ne of my brothers or sisters. It is always a potluck. We never have formal dinner pa rties so we never need catering. At the potluck this past weekend, some pe ople brought casseroles, some brought chips and dip, and some brought cookie s and cakes for dessert. I usually don't have to bring anything since I'm the guest of honor.
> There is always a lot of talking and laughing at ou r family parties. Someone always brings up old childhood memories or a funny anecdote from the old days. A family get-together as big as ours can be overwhe lming for some people. When they ask me what it's like to be part of such a big family, I always tell them one thing: It's noisy!

We’re talking about, in this episode, a family part y that I went to this past weekend. I was visiting my hometown. Your “hometown ” – all one word, “home” and “town” – is the place where you were born, wher e you were raised, where you grew up. I visit my hometown, which is St. Paul , Minnesota, by the way, about once a year. And this year I was in town for about five days. When we say “in town,” we mean at that particular place. So, if  someone asks you, “How long are you going to be in town?” they mean, “How long are you going to be visiting here or staying here?”

I was in town for about five days and there was a “ family get-together.” “Get- together” is a hyphenated word. The verb “to get” w ith the word “together” means to put things together. Well, a “get-together” is a  party or a meeting. It’s a group of people who are coming together, usually for some  social reason. My get- together, my family get-together, “wasn’t a family reunion.” A “family reunion” is when Grandma, Grandpa, your uncles and aunts and co usins – anyone with your last name or related to you – all come together in a big party.

“This wasn’t a family reunion,” I said, “because it  was just my immediate family.” Your “immediate family” is your mother, your father , your brothers and sisters, and usually your brothers’ and sisters’ husbands or  wives. Those would be your “in-laws.” Your brother-in-law is married to your s ister. Your sister-in-law is married to your brother. And they may have children ; those would be your nieces and nephews. That is the immediate family. Or, some  people just talk about the father, the mother, and the children as immediate f amily. An “extended family” would include other parts of your family: Grandma, Grandpa, uncles, and that sort of thing.

I said there were “45 people who showed up” to the get-together. That’s true, by the way. I’m not making that up. “To show up” means  to come to an event. If you’re going to have a party, people would “show up ” to your party. You can “show up to a meeting” – that means you go to the m eeting. Sometimes we say, “Be sure to show up,” meaning be sure to go to that  event.

The family parties that we have are in the house of  one of my brothers and sisters, and “it is always a potluck.” A “potluck” (potluck) is a meal in which everyone brings something different and we all share each other’s food. So, one person brings a salad, another person brings meat to cook hamburgers, or pizza, or some other sort of dish. Someone brings dessert,  someone brings something to drink, someone else brings other things like chi ps, and so forth.

These are not “dinner parties.” I said that we don’ t have “formal dinner parties.” A “dinner party” is a little bit more formal event, w here you sit down and someone comes and brings the food to you. At a “potluck,” u sually you have your own plate, and you go up to a table where all the food is and you get your own food.

This was not a formal dinner party, so we didn’t ne ed “catering.” “To cater” a party, or “to cater” an event – a wedding, a funera l, a Bar Mitzvah, anything like that – means to provide the food. Usually, a profes sional cook and the cook’s helpers come, and they cook the food and serve you the food. They are responsible for all the food and drink – that is ca tering. When I got married – how many years ago? A long time ago – we had “catering”  at our wedding. We had

someone cater the wedding. They took care of all the food and so forth. At least, I think that’s what happened. I don’t remember very  clearly.

In any case, I said that some people at our get-tog ether brought “casseroles.” A “casserole” (casserole) is what we call, in my stat e of Minnesota, a “hot dish.” A casserole usually has some sort of what we would ca ll a “starch” (starch), such as rice or pasta or potatoes. And this is mixed in with meat, often ground beef or ham or turkey or chicken, and usually some sort of cream soup, like cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup. You mix it all to gether and then you put it in the oven and bake it at, I don’t know, 400 degrees for about 30 minutes, and then it’s all ready to eat. That’s a casserole.

I said that some people brought “chips and dip.” “C hips” means potato chips, or it can mean “tortilla chips,” which are chips popular in Mexico that are made with fried tortillas. You can eat chips with “dip” (dip) . “Dip” can be anything that you put a potato chip or a tortilla chip into. It could  be “salsa,” which is chopped up tomatoes, onions, and other things. Or it could be some sort of “cream dip” – there are all sorts of possibilities. All of it is bad for you, of course, and that’s why it tastes so good.

Cakes for dessert were also brought. Of course, you  know what a “cake” is: you cut a cake on your birthday. People bring cakes for  “dessert,” which comes at the very end of a meal – the best part of the meal.

I mentioned that I did not bring anything, however,  because I was the “guest of honor.” Actually, my wife and I were both the “gues ts of honor.” To be the “guests of honor” means that the party was being thrown – a nd notice we use the verb “to throw” for a party – the party was being thrown or being organized for me and my wife. So, we were the “guests of honor.”

I said that in my family get-togethers, there’s alw ays a lot of talking and laughing, and that someone always brings up “childhood memori es or a funny anecdote from the old days.” “Childhood” – all one word (chi ldhood) – means things related to when you were a child. And an “anecdote” is a st ory, often a funny story about something. So, you can have an “anecdote” about wha t happened to you yesterday, and usually the anecdote is funny or ent ertaining somehow.

Finally, I said that a big family get-together “can  be overwhelming for some people.” “To be overwhelming” is when something is much more than what you expected. It can even cause you to become a little confused or nervous or anxious. When you are “overwhelmed” with work, for example, you have too much work. And that’s the basic meaning of overwhel ming.

 Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I visit my hometown about once a year. This year, I  was in town for about five days and there was a family get-together. It wasn't  a family reunion since it was just my immediate family, but still, there was a to tal of about 45 people who showed up.

Our family parties are always held at the home of o ne of my brothers or sisters. It is always a potluck. We never have formal dinner pa rties so we never need catering. At the potluck this past weekend, some pe ople brought casseroles, some (people) brought chips and dip, and some broug ht cookies and cakes for dessert. I usually don't have to bring anything sin ce I'm the guest of honor.

There is always a lot of talking and laughing at ou r family parties. Someone always brings up old childhood memories or a funny anecdote from the old days. A family get-together as big as ours can be overwhe lming for some people. When they ask me what it's like to be part of such a big family, I always tell them one thing: It's noisy!

# Noisy Neighbors

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 56 – Noisy Neighbors.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 56. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss noisy neigh bors. Let's get started. > I live in a quiet neighborhood. At least that's wha t I thought until last week.
> I live in a cul-de-sac in a residential neighborhoo d in Los Angeles. There is a nice retired couple that lives kitty-corner from me. The y have always been very friendly and we have gotten along very well.
> About three months ago, they decided to renovate th eir garage and turn it into a guesthouse. Since they don’t have a lot of money, they wanted to rent out the unit to help make ends meet.
> A new renter moved in about three weeks ago, and th at's when the trouble began. She was a student at the local university an d she liked to invite her friends over. The trouble was they kept very late h ours, and they liked to play loud music. My neighbors were at their wits' end. T hey talked to their tenant several times about the noise, but nothing worked. Finally, they asked her to move out. Fortunately, she was on a month-to-month lease and they didn't have any problems.
> Now that my neighbors have learned their lesson, th eir new tenant is a nice widow with two cats. I'm so glad that everything wo rked out in the end!

Today’s story had to do with my noisy neighbors. I started by saying that “I live in a quiet neighborhood. . . . I live in a cul-de-sac”  (cul) (de) (sac). It comes from French. It’s one of the many loan words, or words t hat we borrow in English from other languages. A “cul-de-sac” is street that is a  “dead end” that doesn’t go any farther. It’s where a street ends and there are hou ses around this little – normally,

a circle – and it’s considered a quiet place, usual ly, because there isn’t very much traffic. The road ends in the cul-de-sac.

So, we live in a cul-de-sac in a “residential neigh borhood.” A “residential neighborhood” just means that’s a neighborhood wher e there are lots of houses and apartments, not a lot of buildings or businesse s or factories. If it’s “residential,” that means it’s usually mostly house s and apartments. It comes from the word “resident,” which is someone who live s in a place. I am a resident of Los Angeles; I live here.

There’s “a nice retired couple that lives kitty-cor ner from me.” A “couple” is two people – a man and a wife, for example – who live t ogether. The couple lives “kitty-corner.” “Kitty (kitty) corner,” two words. Imagine you have two streets that cross, okay? The building that is on the southwest corner is “kitty-corner” from the building on the northeast corner. It’s diagonal  from the house or the building. So, this house is “kitty-corner,” meaning it’s diag onal – not right next to me but diagonal across the street.

I said that this couple has “always been very frien dly” and that we “have gotten along very well.” “To get along” with someone, you probably know, means to be friendly, to be polite – not to have any arguments.  This is what we want from all of our neighbors, that they get along. Actually, th at they just be quiet. That would be more important to me.

The neighbors “decided to renovate their garage and  turn it into a guesthouse.” “To renovate” means to make better, to change – par ticularly a house or a building. “We are going to renovate our house” mean s we’re going to add something to it, change it, improve it, make it bet ter. A “garage,” you know, is where you park your car – where you put your car. I  said they were going to “turn it into.” “To turn something into” means to change it into – in this case, a “guesthouse,” all one word. “Guesthouse” is, you ca n guess, a place where you have someone staying who is a guest of yours. It co uld be a family member. It could be someone that you rent the guesthouse to.

I said this couple doesn’t have a lot of money, so they “wanted to rent out the unit to help make ends meet.” “To rent out” is the same as to rent. Remember, in English we have lots of verbs where we add a prepos ition at the end. It doesn’t change the meaning often. “To rent,” “to rent out” mean really the same thing. When we talk about an apartment or a condominium or  a townhouse, we call each one of those a “unit.” You could have “a 20-un it apartment building,” meaning there are 20 apartments that you can rent.

My neighbors wanted “to help make ends meet.” “To make ends meet” means you can pay for all of your bills: your gas bill, y our mortgage, your downloads from the iTunes music store . . . all of those thin gs are part of “making ends meet.”

The trouble began with my neighbor when a “new rent er” – a “renter” (renter), a noun for someone who rents – a “new renter” moved i n. She was “a student at the local university” and she and her friends liked  to keep “very late hours.” “To keep late hours” means that you stay up. You don’t go to bed until very late. They liked to “keep late hours” and “play loud music,” a nd my neighbors “were at their wits’ end.”

The expression “to be at your wits’ end” means that  you don’t know what to do. You’ve tried everything else. You can’t think of a solution. You are desperate. The word “wits” (wits) is another word for intellig ence, ability. “He doesn’t have his wits about him” is another expression with this  word “wits.” “To have your wits about you” means to know what you are doing, to hav e some intelligence. Here, “to be at your wits’ end (end)” means that you’ve r eached the end, if you will, of your intelligence. You don’t know what to do: “to b e at your wits’ end.”

My neighbors asked their “tenant” (tenant) – that’s  a noun meaning the same as a “renter”; a “tenant” is someone who rents a build ing or apartment, a house – they asked their “tenant” or “renter” to “move out. ” “To move out” – again, notice that verb with the preposition “out” – “to move out ” means, really, to move, to leave a place. So, we add that word “out” to give it a little more emphasis. “To move out” means to move to another place, to leave.

The “renter” or “tenant” was on a “month-to-month l ease.” A “lease” (lease) is a contract or an agreement to rent a house, apartment , or some other building, or what we might call a “property.” “To be on a month- to-month lease” means that you only are obligated – you only have to stay some where – for 30 days. Then, if you want to leave, you can leave.

A different kind of lease would be a “one-year leas e,” where you are required to be there for one year, and if you leave or move out  before, you have to pay the difference in rent that you owe to the “landlord.”

Finally, I said that my neighbors had “learned thei r lesson.” “To learn your lesson,” as an expression, means that I know better  now. I won’t make that mistake again. I was wrong and the experience taugh t me something.

My neighbors rented their guesthouse to “a nice wid ow.” “Widow” is (widow). A “widow” is a woman whose husband has died. Or anoth er expression is “passed away.” When someone dies, we say, perhaps a little bit more politely, “They passed away.” Well, a “widow” is someone, a woman, whose husband has passed away. A man whose wife has passed away is ca lled a “widower,” with an -er at the end.

I said at the end that I was “so glad everything wo rked out in the end.” For something “to work out in the end” means that it ca me to a successful conclusion or resolution – that all the problems were solved.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > I live in a quiet neighborhood. At least that's wha t I thought until last week.
> I live in a cul-de-sac in a residential neighborhoo d in Los Angeles. There is a nice retired couple that lives kitty-corner from me. The y have always been very friendly and we have gotten along very well.
> About three months ago, they decided to renovate th eir garage and turn it into a guesthouse. Since they don’t have a lot of money, they wanted to rent out the unit to help make ends meet.

# Making a Presentation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 57 – Making a Presentation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 57. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss giving a pr esentation for a business meeting or for a class in school. Let's get started . > I don't normally get stage fright, but the thought of getting up in front of my colleagues to give a presentation always gives me b utterflies. But I have no choice; my boss asked me to do it, so I will.
> I set up my projector and PowerPoint program on my laptop. Clearing my voice, I stood up and addressed the 10 people present at the meeting. I started off by saying, "Good afternoon. I want to thank you for in viting me to talk to you today." I had a clicker in my hand to advance the s lides. "Today I'm going to talk to you about our new product, Provasic. Please  feel free to ask questions as we go along," I said.
> I then flipped through the slides showing pictures of our product, and concluded by summarizing the main points of my talk with bull et points. I finished by saying, "Thank you for your attention today. My con tact information is on your handout." Whew! I was glad that was over!

We talked today about giving a presentation at a bu siness meeting, for example. I started by saying that I don’t normally get “stage fright.” “Stage fright,” two words, is when you get scared or nervo us when you have to stand up in front of other people and talk. A “stage,” yo u know, is a place where you have a play in a theater, and “fright” is another w ord for “to be afraid.” “Stage fright,” then, is to be afraid of the stage, but he re we use it more generally to mean anytime you are nervous, or anxious, or scared  about standing up and talking to a group of people.

I said that I had to get up in front of – or stand up in front of – “my colleagues.” “My colleagues,” a noun, refers to the people that I work with or that are in the same profession as I am, the same job type as I am.  These are my colleagues.

I said that when I have to get up in front to give a presentation, I always get “butterflies,” or it “gives me butterflies.” A “but terfly” is an insect that has beautiful wings. It’s small and many people – some people – try to catch butterflies with a big net. A “butterfly” comes ori ginally from a cocoon and then it is sort of born out of a little cocoon, or little s hell. Well, when we say, “I have butterflies in my stomach,” we mean that I feel – m y stomach feels – a little bit nauseated. That is, I don’t feel very well. My stom ach isn’t feeling very well because I am nervous, because I am scared of someth ing. Usually, when you have to give a presentation, people get nervous, an d sometimes they get “butterflies in their stomach.” It’s the expression  we use to say that you’re starting to feel a little sick because you are so n ervous.

“I set up my projector” – or I got my projector rea dy – for my “PowerPoint program.” A “projector” is a machine with a lens th at shows the picture on a larger screen. You can have a “movie projector” – a  projector in a movie theater. You can have a projector at a meeting conn ected to your computer. It shows something up on a big screen, a place where y ou watch a movie or look at pictures. “PowerPoint,” you probably know, is Mi crosoft software that is used for giving presentations.

I said I started my presentation by “clearing my vo ice.” “To clear your voice” means to go like this (clears voice), meaning to cl ear it so that you can speak more clearly. So, “to clear your voice” means to do  what I just did so that your voice sounds better. I said that I stood up and I “ addressed the 10 people present at the meeting.” “To address” means to talk  to a group of people. I said they were “10 people present,” meaning 10 people wh o are there physically at the meeting. That word “present” means a gift, but here it means, it can also mean, to be somewhere, to actually be physically in  a place. “There were students present at the – in the classroom.” That’s  the meaning of “present” here.

I started off by saying, “Good afternoon. I want to  thank you for inviting me to talk to you today.” “To start off” means to begin, you probably know. The expression “I want to thank you for inviting me” is  a common way of starting a presentation if you were, in fact, invited to give a presentation. You start, often, by thanking people. “I want to thank you for inviti ng me today.”

I then said that I had “a clicker in my hand to adv ance the slides.” When you’re giving a presentation like a PowerPoint presentatio n, a “clicker” is a little device, usually smaller than your hand, that has buttons on  it so you can go forward or backward in terms of the pictures or the “slides” t hat you are showing. In a PowerPoint presentation, we call each screen or eac h picture, if you will, a “slide.” Well, you can “advance the slides,” meanin g go forward from one to two to three. You can also go back in your slides to go  backwards: three, two, one. A clicker allows you to go back or forward. It’s us ually like a remote control, really. A remote control is a clicker.

I began my talk by saying, “Today I’m going to talk  to you about our new product” – a very common way of starting a presenta tion, after you thank people for their attention or inviting you, is to t ell them what you’re going to talk about. “Today, I am going to talk to you about my n ew product,” whatever it is. I also used the expression, “Please feel free to ask questions.” That is a very polite way of telling someone that it’s okay for th em to ask questions: to “feel free.” When someone says, “Please feel free to call  me,” that means it’s okay for you to call me. I don’t mind.

I “flipped through the slides” showing pictures of my product. “To flip through” means to go through – usually, to go through more o r less quickly. You can “flip through” slides. We normally – commonly, rather – t alk about “flipping through a book” or “flipping through a magazine” – means you turn the pages very quickly just to get an idea about what is in the magazine o r the book.

I said that I concluded “by summarizing the main po ints of my talk with bullet points.” “The point” of something is the main idea of something. So, when you say, “the main points,” you mean the main ideas of your talk. “Bullet points,” you probably know, “bullet points” is when, on a pi ece of . . . on a computer, on a word processing document, or on a slide in PowerP oint, you have little dots – little usually black dots – and these dots are “ind ented,” meaning they’re moved in a little bit from the edge of the page, and they ’re used to list things. So, a “bullet point” is something that uses that format o n a page.

I ended my presentation by saying, “Thank you for y our attention today. My contact information is on your handout.” Again, a very common way of ending a presentation is to thank people for their attention . This means you are thanking them for paying attention to you, for listening to you, for not falling asleep. My students usually don’t pay attention to me. They are sleeping, or listening to their iPods, or text messaging their friends, and s o forth. But you want to thank people for paying attention. “Thank you for your at tention today” – it means the same.

 “My contact information” is my name, my address, my  telephone number – how you can contact or get in touch with me. I said tha t I put my contact information on a “handout.” That’s one word (handout), a noun w hich means a piece of paper that you give at a presentation or in a class  that has information about your presentation on it. You can have “handouts” at  a conference or any sort of presentation.

I ended by saying “Whew! (I’m) glad that was over.”  That little sound that I made (whew!) is spelled (whew), and it’s an exclama tion, if you will. It’s a sound that we make in English to express relief. “I’m so glad this day is over. Whew!” That’s how I make the sound. Other native speakers may make it differently, but when you see it in a book or see it in writing,  it’s spelled (whew).

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > I don't normally get stage fright, but the thought of getting up in front of my colleagues to give a presentation always gives me b utterflies. But I have no choice; my boss asked me to do it, so I will.
> I set up my projector and PowerPoint program on my laptop. Clearing my voice, I stood up and addressed the 10 people present at the meeting. I started off by saying, "Good afternoon. I want to thank you for in viting me to talk to you today." I had a clicker in my hand to advance the s lides. "Today I'm going to talk to you about our new product, Provasic. Please  feel free to ask questions as we go along," I said.
> I then flipped through the slides showing pictures of our product, and concluded by summarizing the main points of my talk with bull et points. I finished by saying, "Thank you for your attention today. My con tact information is on your handout." Whew! I was glad that was over!

# Having Car Trouble

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 58 – Having Car Trouble.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 58. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss having prob lems with your car. Let's get started. > As I was driving home from work, my car started act ing up. It was making a strange noise and the engine was running roughly. W hen I got home, I popped open the hood to see if there was anything wrong. A fter looking around for a few minutes and not seeing anything, I decided to take my car to the shop.
> I took it down to street to Manny's Car Repair. I'v e never had luck finding a really honest mechanic, but Manny was no worse than most. I explained to Manny the problem and he took a look at it right away. Finall y, he narrowed it down to the fan belt. I asked him how much it would set me back , and he said $80 with parts and labor.
> I usually feel like I'm getting ripped off when I g o to a repair shop, but for once, I thought Manny was being straight with me. I asked h ow long he needed to keep the car, and he said at least until the end of the day tomorrow. He said he would order the part right away and he’d call me when it was ready.
> Oh, well. I guess it could have been a lot worse. I  better dust off my bike to take to work tomorrow. It's about time I got some exerci se!

In this podcast, I had more trouble with my car. I said that I was driving home from work and my car “started acting up.” “To act u p” means here that something is going wrong. “My television is acting up” means it’s not working properly. I said it was “making a strange noise” and that “the engin e was running roughly.” The “engine” is the motor – it’s a part of the car that  makes it go. We talk about an engine or a motor “running smoothly,” meaning runni ng well – working well,

functioning well. Or it can be “running roughly,” m eaning it’s not functioning; it’s not working correctly.

When I got home, I said I “popped open the hood.” T he “hood” (hood) is the part of the car that lifts up, usually in the front of the car where the motor is. It’s like a door that you lift up. And we use the verb “pop ope n.” “To pop open” means that you push a button inside your car and that unlocks the hood so that you can open it.

I said I had to “take my car to the shop.” And, you  probably know, “the shop” is somewhere where you get something fixed, something repaired. There can be a car shop, a camera shop, a computer shop. Anywhere where they fix or repair machines can be called a “shop” – (shop), as a noun . I said that I took my car to “Manny’s Car Repair.” I don’t have a lot of luck fi nding an “honest mechanic.” A “mechanic” is someone who fixes cars. But I said th at Manny was “no worse than most.” When we say someone or something is “no wors e than most,” we mean that he is not any worse than any other or most oth er mechanics. He’s about the same in terms of – here, in terms of honesty.

I explained to Manny my problem, and he “narrowed it down to the fan belt.” “To narrow something down” means to eliminate other pos sibilities, other options, and focus on a small group or one set of possibilit ies or choices. So, I want to go see a movie tonight, and I want to see a horror mov ie and my wife wants to see a romantic movie. We have to “narrow it down” to one or the other in order to make a decision. Of course, we go see the romantic movie  because my wife is always right.

Now, the “fan belt” is the part of the car that con nects the motor to a “fan.” You know what a “fan” is – that spins around to keep yo u cool. Well, there’s a fan in your motor – your engine – to keep your engine cool , I guess. It connects the fan to the motor so the fan will go around.

I asked Manny how much it would “set me back.” When  you ask somebody how much it’s going to “set you back,” that’s an inform al way of saying, “How much is it going to cost?” A “setback” as a noun is a disap pointment or something that moves you backwards instead of forwards either in t erms of your finances, your money, or something else. You can have a setback in  your job, meaning you didn’t get a promotion or you didn’t get a raise. T hese could be considered setbacks. But when we say, “It set me back $20,” we  mean it cost me $20.

Manny said that $80 was the cost for “parts and lab or.” “Parts” are the physical objects, the things that have to go into your car. And “labor” (labor) is the work;

it’s the time the mechanic charges you for to do the repair. So, “parts and labor” are the two parts of, or two things that go into, r epairing your car.

I said I usually feel I’m getting “ripped off.” “To  rip off,” two words, is a verb which means to steal – to have somebody steal something f rom you, often because they are cheating you. They are cheating you in som e sort of business transaction or business situation. “I feel I am bei ng ripped off by the grocery stores,” or “I’m being ripped off at the gas statio n because the price of gas is so expensive.” That’s what we mean when we say “to rip  off.” It means someone is taking your money – and not taking your money hones tly for what they give you.

I said that I thought in this case Manny “was being  straight with me.” “To be straight with” someone means you’re being honest wi th them. You’re telling them the truth. If someone says, “He’s not being straigh t with me,” we mean he’s lying. He’s not telling the truth. Now, that’s different f rom “to be straight.” “To be straight” means that you are a heterosexual – that if you’re a man you like women, and if you’re a woman you like men. That’s b eing “straight.” It’s used as the opposite of “gay” or “homosexual” people.

The end of the story . . . at the end of the story,  I said that I better “dust off my bike to take to work tomorrow.” “To dust off,” lite rally, also can mean to take a piece of cloth – a rag, a towel – and remove dust o r little pieces of dirt on a table or on a chair, and so forth. Here, however, when we  say, “I’m going to dust off my piano,” “I’m going to dust off my bike,” we don’ t mean physically remove dirt. We mean I’m going to start using it again, but it h as been a long time since I have used it. In fact, it’s been so long, there’s d ust on it, there’s dirt on it. So, you can use that for lots of things. “I’m going to dust  off my Spanish to talk to my friend in Mexico” means I haven’t used it for a lon g time.

Finally, I said that “it’s about time I got some ex ercise.” When we say “it’s about time,” the idea is that it’s been too long, and it’ s often something of a complaint. When you say to someone who is supposed to come to your house at seven o’clock and they show up – they arrive – at seven t hirty, you say, “Well, it’s about time,” meaning it’s taking too long for you to do w hatever you were supposed to do.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

As I was driving home from work, my car started act ing up. It was making a strange noise and the engine was running roughly. W hen I got home, I popped

open the hood to see if there was anything wrong. A fter looking around for a few minutes and not seeing anything, I decided to take my car to the shop.

I took it down to street to Manny's Car Repair. I'v e never had luck finding a really honest mechanic, but Manny was no worse than most. I explained to Manny the problem and he took a look at it right away. Finall y, he narrowed it down to the fan belt. I asked him how much it would set me back , and he said $80 with parts and labor.

I usually feel like I'm getting ripped off when I g o to a repair shop, but for once, I thought Manny was being straight with me. I asked h ow long he needed to keep the car, and he said at least until the end of the day tomorrow. He said he would order the part right away and he’d call me when it was ready.

Oh, well. I guess it could have been a lot worse. I  better dust off my bike to take to work tomorrow. It's about time I got some exerci se!

# Opening a Bank Account

S

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 59 – Opening a Bank Account.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 59. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss opening a b ank account. Let's get started. > I decided to switch banks recently, and after looki ng at my options, I went for Mar Vista National Bank. I drove over to the bank, park ed next to the drive-through teller lanes, and walked inside.
> I made my way to the new accounts desk and was gree ted by John, one of the customer service representatives there. I told him I wanted to open a new checking and savings account. He said he’d be happy  to help me, and gave me a form to fill out with my personal information, incl uding place of employment, home address, and so forth. I had to show him a gov ernment-issued ID and give him my Social Security number.
> John asked if I wanted an interest-bearing account with overdraft protection. Technically, he said, the savings account is a mone y market where I can earn interest daily. The checking was free if I had dire ct deposit, and my checks were also free.
> I signed on the dotted line, gave him the minimum d eposit to open the account, and thanked him for his help. I'm glad I got that o ut of the way. Now all I need to do is make some money to put into my accounts!

Today we opened a bank account. An “account” is an agreement for someone to hold your money for you, and in a “bank account,” the bank takes your money and holds it for you. I said that we “opened” a ban k account. That is, we start a bank account or we start an agreement with the bank  so that they will give us . . . we can give them our money.

I said, “I decided to switch banks recently.” “To s witch” means to change – to change one thing for another. “I’m going to switch pens; I don’t like the one I’m using,” meaning I’m not going to use this one and I ’m going to use another one. We sometimes use the expression “to switch places.”  “To switch places” means you go where I am and I go where you are, if we wer e sitting at a table, for example.

I said that I looked at my “options” – or my choice s – and I “went for” the Mar Vista National Bank. “To go for” something here mea ns to decide in favor of – to decide to select or choose that one. “I went for the chicken at the restaurant” means I decided to eat the chicken and not the beef . I said, “I drove over to the bank.” Again, this is one of the many cases where w e have a preposition after a verb, using it here to have a little more emphasis.  “I drove to the bank,” “I drove over to the bank” – they’re very similar in meaning .

I said I parked “next to the drive-through teller l anes.” A “teller” is the person, the clerk, that works at a bank and the one that you ta lk to – to give your money or to take your money from. A “drive-through teller” is w hen you can drive in your car up to a window and talk to a person without getting  out of your car. Nowadays, in most banks they don’t have drive-through tellers; they have drive-through ATM machines – Automatic Teller Machines – instead of h uman beings.

I said I “made my way” to the new accounts desk and  was greeted by John. “To make your way” somewhere means to find your way – to find the path or the route to something. “Did you make your way home las t night okay in the storm?” The idea is that there was some difficulty in findi ng, or in getting to, a certain place. “He made his way to the restaurant” – he got  lost but he finally got there.

There are two basic kinds of accounts you can open in a bank. A “savings account” is when you give the bank your money and it usually gives you interest on your money. That is to say, it pays you a certai n percentage for keeping your money with them. Nowadays, in the United States, it ’s probably 1 or 2 percent – not very much.

A “checking account” is where you give the bank you r money but you can get it back by writing a “check” – a piece of paper with y our name on it and signature. It’s sort of like a . . . a check is sort of like a n “I.O.U” – means “I owe you.” The letters (IOU) stand for a note or a piece of paper that says that I will pay you this amount. Well, a checking account can also be an acc ount where you earn interest. Notice the use of the verb “earn” here. “ To earn (earn) interest” is the verb we use meaning to get interest. So, there are these two kinds of accounts.

And I said that John gave me a “form to fill out. A  “form” is a piece of paper that asks for certain information. The verb we almost al ways use with “form” is “fill out.” You have to fill out your customs form when y ou come to the United States. You have to fill out a form in order to get a loan from the bank. All of these are uses of “to fill out a form” – expression. I also s aid that I had to put down my “place of employment.” That, of course, is where I work – my home address and so forth. The expression “and so forth” means “etc. ” It means “and other things.”

I said I had to give the customer service represent ative a “government-issued I.D.” An “I.D.” is an identification. Your driver’s  license with your picture and your name and your address – that’s an I.D. A “governmen t-issued” . . . “to issue” means to give, so a “government-issued I.D.” is one  that the government gives you – usually a driver’s license or a passport.

In the United States, you may know that we have a r etirement – a government retirement – program when you turn 65. When you are  65 years old or so, you can get money from the government depending on how much Social Security taxes you pay. So, Social Security is our federal o r national retirement system – not a very good system, in my opinion, but that’s a nother question. Everyone, or almost everyone, who lives in the United States has  a Social Security number, and that’s a nine-digit number. So, it’s: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Those numbers are given to you, and they are used for identification.  It’s sort of like a national identification number that everyone has.

John asked me if I wanted an “interest bearing acco unt with overdraft protection.” An “interest bearing” (bearing) . . . if an account  is “interest bearing,” that just means it earns or gets interest; you get money for keeping your money in that account. An “overdraft” is when you write a check f or more than what you have in your bank account. The noun we used for that is an “overdraft,” all one word (overdraft).

“Overdraft protection” is a service that many banks  offer, that if you write a check for too much money – by mistake, we hope – the bank  will loan you the money that you don’t have in your account in order to “ca sh the check,” or to give people money for the check that you wrote. That’s called “ cashing a check.” John explained to me that my savings account was actuall y a “money market account,” and a “money market” is a type of account that earn s a little bit more interest than the other regular savings account.

Most banks in the United States will give you “free  checking” – meaning they won’t charge you any money for having a checking ac count – if you have “direct deposit.” “Direct deposit” means that your “employe r,” the company you work for,

they will automatically electronically put money – your money – into your account every two weeks, or every month, or however often y ou get paid. So, you don’t get a check that you have to take to the bank. They  automatically electronically put it in our account. This is called “direct depos it.” And if you have direct deposit in a bank account, many banks will not charge you a  fee for the account.

I said that I “signed on the dotted line” and gave John the “minimum deposit.” “To sign on the dotted line” means that we sign an offi cial form – we sign a document of some sort. Traditionally, the place where you pu t your signature . . . the line was often dotted rather than being a straight line,  and that’s where the expression comes from. But it just means to sign so mething, to put your signature on something. A “minimum deposit” is the minimum or least amount of money that I can open an account with.

And finally, I said that I was glad I “got that out  of the way.” “To get something out of the way” means that you have something you have to do – you probably don’t want to do it, but you do it so that you don’t have  to worry about it anymore. So, for example, I need to clean the house before my wi fe gets home. I decide I’m going to clean the kitchen and “get that out of the  way” first, because it’s the hardest thing to do.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I decided to switch banks recently, and after looki ng at my options, I went for Mar Vista National Bank. I drove over to the bank, park ed next to the drive-through teller lanes, and walked inside.

I made my way to the new accounts desk and was gree ted by John, one of the customer service representatives there. I told him I wanted to open a new checking and savings account.

# Calling Tech Support

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 60 – Calling Tech Support.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 60. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss calling tec h support for help with your computer. Let's get started. > I recently signed up for a new ISP for my office, u sing DSL. I managed to get the modem and the router configured properly, but now m y email won't work. I dug out the manual that came with the modem and called the toll-free line for technical support. I'm not a big fan of most IT dep artments, but if something doesn't work, they're the only game in town.
> I explained to the tech support person that I could n't get my email to send or receive. He asked me if I had checked the Ethernet connection from the modem to the router, and I said I did. Then he asked if I  had run any diagnostics on the email software and if I was able to connect to the web. I said no to both of these questions.
> He told me he would submit a ticket and have the pr oblem escalated to the next level. Someone should be calling me back, he said. I won’t hold my breath.

I began the podcast by saying that I “signed up for  a new ISP for my office.” “To sign up” for something means to register or to purc hase something. Usually we “sign up” for some sort of service that someone is going to give me, or to give us. I “signed up” here means I bought a new “ISP.” “ISP ” stands for, or means, “Internet Service Provider.” This is the company th at provides you with Internet access in your home or in your office.

I was signing up for a “DSL” Internet service. “DSL ” is an Internet connection that comes over your phone lines. The other type of conn ection would be a “cable Internet” connection, where it comes through a sepa rate cable that is used to bring you your cable television stations. But I’m t alking about a “DSL,” which is a

phone connection. It’s a fast connection. It’s not a “dial-up” connection. A “dial- up” connection is not very fast. “DSL” is much fast er, and cable is usually faster than “DSL” in the United States.

Anyway, I said, “I managed to get the modem and the  router configured properly.” “To manage” something means that you suc ceeded – you were successful in something. “I managed to find a chair  in the crowded classroom.” “To manage” also means to work with people. To be the “manager” of someone or some people means that you are sort of the boss.  But here, the verb “to manage to get” – using it with another verb – means  that you were successful. “I managed to call my father last night”; I had some d ifficulty but I managed to do it.

The “modem” is the part of your computer that conne cts so that you can get on the Internet or get on email. A “router” is kind of  a box. The box will divide or split up the signal to the other computers. They can each  have their own wire that connects to the router, or it could be a “wireless router.”

A “wireless router” is a router that you don’t need  wires for. It’s a router that works usually on what we call “Wi-Fi” (wifi), where  the computers can communicate with the Internet connection without having any wires connecting them. It’s a “wireless” connection just like your c ell phone is a “wireless” phone. There are no wires to connect it to a telephone lin e. It works through radio waves, if you will, in the air. You can tell that I  am not a computer expert.

I said that I “configured” the router and new modem  properly. “To configure” a piece of – a machine or a piece of software means t hat you set it up. You made sure that it was . . . all the parts were connected  correctly, okay? That you made sure that all of the information was provided in the software, for example – that is “to configure” something.

I said that I “dug out” my manual that came with the modem. “To dig out” literally means to take a shovel and put it in the ground to get rid of dirt. That tool we use to get rid of dirt or to dig a hole is called a “sh ovel.” But when we say, “I dug out my manual” or “I dug out my pictures in the drawer, ” we mean that it was put away in such a manner that it was difficult to find , or that we didn’t have it easily available to us.

So, I dug out my manual and I called the “toll-free ” number for technical support. “The toll-free line,” I said. “Toll-free” means, yo u probably know, you don’t have to pay for the call. In the United States, these we re – up until recently these were – all 800 numbers. So, instead of dialing 310-555-1 212, you would dial 800-555- 1212. The “800” means it didn’t cost you any money.

 By the way, in television and in movies we often us e the number 555-1212. That’s not a real telephone number; it’s what we ca ll a “phony” or a false number. And people will use it when they’re giving an examp le and they don’t want to give a real telephone number. I will not give my real te lephone number here on the podcast.

A “toll-free line” or a “number” is here . . . the “line” is really a telephone number for technical support. “Technical Support” is, as y ou probably know, the people you talk to when there is something wrong with your  computer.

I said I’m “not a big fan of most IT departments.” “To be a fan” of something means to like something or like a group of people. You can be a fan of a football team, for example. “IT” stands for Information Tech nology. These are the computer people who build computers, and program so ftware for computers, and so forth. I said that, unfortunately, “They’re the only game in town,” meaning there’s no one else that you can call. When we say,  “He’s the only game in town,” we mean he’s the only person who can do a ce rtain thing.

I called the “tech support” person. And we sometime s say “tech support” instead of “technical support”; it’s the same thing. I call ed the “tech support” person and they asked me to check my “Ethernet” connection. No w, an “Ethernet” connection is just a special type of computer conne ction we use, usually with connecting to the Internet, though you can also use  it to connect two computers to transfer files between computers. Do not ask me how to do that, however. I don’t know.

The tech support person asked me if I had run any “ diagnostics.” A “diagnostic” . . . the verb here is “to diagnose,” which means to figure out or to discover what is wrong with something. So, “diagnostics” means that,  in many software programs, you can run a program that will check to see what is wrong with your program or with your computer. I said I was not able to “conne ct to the web.” We use that verb “to connect,” meaning we are able to communica te with the connection, if you will, and be able to get on the Internet. That’ s called “connecting to the web.”

The technical support person said he would “submit a ticket.” Here, “to submit a ticket” – or we sometimes say a “trouble ticket” – means that he’s going to fill out a form. He’s going to fill out a piece of paper or type in a form on the computer and send it to someone else who will try to help me . So, submitting a “trouble ticket” to an IT department means that you are tell ing them what the problem is and asking them to help. The problem in my case was  “escalated to the next level.” “To escalate a problem” – “to escalate” any thing – means to bring it to a

higher level, to raise it up. Here, it means that the supervisor or the person who has more knowledge will look at my problem.

I ended by saying that I was told someone would cal l me back, or call me on the telephone, but I said, “I won’t hold my breath.” the expression “Don’t hold your breath” or “I won’t hold my breath” . . . your brea th, of course, is (breathing sound) – what you breathe, okay? That’s your breath , the air that comes in and out of your body. “To hold your breath” would be, of course, to stop breathing. But when we say, “I won’t hold my breath,” we mean “I don’t expect anything to happen” – that I don’t think this person will actua lly call me, in this case.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > I recently signed up for a new ISP for my office, u sing DSL. I managed to get the modem and the router configured properly, but now m y email won't work. I dug out the manual that came with the modem and called the toll-free line for technical support.

# Missing Person, Part 1: "The Man in the Mask."

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 61 – Missing Person , Part 1: "The Man in the Mask."

This is ESL Podcast episode 61. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beau tiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the first of a special series calle d Missing Person . Unlike our regular podcasts, the next 12 episodes will all be connected as part of one longer story – a detective story, a murder mystery.

The format of these Missing Person  episodes is just like our regular episodes: we’ll listen to a story, then explain it, then hear  it again at a normal speed. We will begin each episode by recapping or reviewing the pr evious episode, beginning with part 2, of course. There are 12 parts to our M issing Person  special episode series.

As you’re listening to the story, don’t worry about  trying to understand every word, but rather, try to get the general meaning of  the story. Now, let’s get started with part 1 of Missing Person . The title of part 1 is “The Man in the Mask.” > I didn’t kill him.
> I didn’t even plan to kill him. I had a gun, but I just wanted to hurt him and stop him from attacking me. I had no idea why this stran ger was hitting me, and it was ticking me off.
> This morning Anne Prado, one of my students at the University of Southwestern California, came to my office. She said she had a p roblem and she needed my help. Her sister, Sarah, was missing. We were on ou r way to Sarah's apartment to find her when, halfway up the front steps of the  building, a man ran toward me and started punching me.
> I hit the man in the ear. He screamed with pain. He  was small, but a tough son- of-a-gun. I stepped back and hit him hard in the st omach.
> “Oh my God!” he moaned. I think I hurt him that tim e.
> Our episode begins with the “narrator,” or the pers on telling the story, saying that he “didn’t kill him.” We begin our story in the mid dle of a fight between two men. One of them, our narrator, has a gun. The other one , a stranger – or someone he doesn’t know – is hitting him, attacking him.

 Our narrator (whose name is Dr. Reeves, we find out  later) says that this man is hitting him, and it’s “ticking [him] off.” “To tick  someone off” means to make them very, very angry – it’s an informal expression. If you say, “I’m ticked off,” that means “I’m mad, I’m angry.” “That person really tic ks me off” means that person really makes me angry. Again, it’s informal, but fa irly common.

Now, our narrator, Dr. Reeves, is a professor at the University of Southwestern California – not a real university, of course, but this is a story. One of his students, Anne Prado, had gone to his office and sa id that she had a problem. Her sister, Sarah, "was missing." “To be missing” m eans that no one knows where you are. We sometimes use the expression “It’ s gone missing” to mean a person or a thing somehow can’t be found; we don’t know where it is.

Dr. Reeves and Anne decide to go over to Sarah’s ap artment. On their way to the apartment, halfway up the front stairs of the b uilding, a man runs toward Dr. Reeves and starts punching him. The expression “to be on your way” means that you are traveling toward something. “I was on my wa y to the store, and I decided to stop and get gasoline.” So, I’m traveling in a p articular direction on my way to some place. “Halfway up the front steps” would be, of course, not the bottom or the top, but somewhere in between. "Halfway up the front steps" someone starts punching our narrator.

Dr. Reeves hits the man back in the ear. He describ es the man as “small, but a tough son-of-a-gun.” A "son-of-a-gun” is a nicer wa y of saying a vulgar expression, which is “son-of-a-” and the last word begins with a “b.” “Son-of-a- gun” is a nicer of way of saying “son-of-a-(bitch), ” but it still has the same meaning, which is: “This is a bad person, this is s omeone who I don’t like very much.”

Dr. Reeves steps back, or moves backward, and hits the man in the stomach. The man cries, “Oh my God!” This is a common expres sion in lots of different languages. “Oh my God!” is something you would say when you’re surprised or you’re angry or, in this case, you’re hurt. The man  “moaned.” “To moan” (moan) is a verb which means to go “Ohh!” – that is to moa n. Usually, we moan in pain. Dr. Reeves says that he knew the man “was in pain,”  and he “pushed him to the ground.” The “ground” is another word for the earth .

The man falls on the grass and Dr. Reeves starts to  question him, or ask him questions. “Who are you? What do you want?” The man  has a “ski mask” on, so Dr. Reeves can’t see the man’s face. “A ski mask” is like a hat that covers your entire head and your face – it just has holes for y our eyes and your mouth. It’s

what people wear in order to keep warm when they go  skiing down the mountain. But they’re also sometimes used by criminals who are trying to prevent other people from seeing who they are.

The man yells at Dr. Reeves, “Just get the hell awa y from this apartment building! You’re not welcome here!” The expression “Get the hell away!” or “Get the hell out of here!” is a vulgar expression that means, basically, the person is very angry. When you see or hear that expression – “Get the hell away from me!” “Get the hell out of here!” – it is a very angry, v ulgar way of telling someone to leave, to go away. Notice it’s not “Get hell away!”  but “Get the hell away!” – that’s just the way the expression goes. The man tells Dr.  Reeves he’s "not welcome here," meaning he doesn’t want him here.

Dr. Reeves then grabs the man by the shirt. Notice the expression “to grab by.” You could grab someone by the ear. You could grab them by the nose. Dr. Reeves pushes the man to the ground and twists his arm. “To twist” (twist) means to turn something. But “to twist someone’s ar m” means to take their arm and turn it so that it hurts. In this case, he twis ts the man’s arm behind his back. He is trying to get the man to stop fighting and to  give him some answers.

Again Dr. Reeves asks the man why he can’t go in the apartment building, but the man “didn’t say a word.” The expression “didn’t  say a word,” means that someone was completely silent; not even one word di d they speak. The man looks at Dr. Reeves “coldly.” “To look at someone c oldly (coldly)” means to look at him in anger or perhaps in fear. The man gets up  and runs away. The doctor then turns to see if he can find Anne and asks if s he is okay, and she says that she is. Dr. Reeves then asks her if she knows the m an, and Anne says no, she doesn’t know who he is.

The episode ends with a recap of what happened. The  narrator tells us that this morning in his office, Anne Prado came and said tha ther sister had been missing for two days. When Anne’s sister, Sarah, didn’t com e to a lunch appointment they had – “didn’t show up,” we would say – Anne de cided to call her sister, but there was “no answer.” When you’re calling on the t elephone and there is "no answer," that means no one picks up or answers the telephone.

Anne then went over to her sister’s apartment and “ knocked on the door.” “To knock” is [knocking sound] like that, to knock on the wood, but “there was no one home.” That’s an expression we use if no one is in the house: “There’s no one home.” Then Anne called Sarah’s work, and Sarah’s b oss told Anne that she had been missing for two days. And that’s when Anne dec ided to go and ask Dr.

Reeves for his help in finding her sister and her s ister’s husband, Bill, who is also missing.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I didn’t kill him.

I didn’t even plan to kill him. I had a gun, but I just wanted to hurt him and stop him from attacking me. I had no idea why this stran ger was hitting me, and it was ticking me off.

This morning Anne Prado, one of my students at the University of Southwestern California, came to my office. She said she had a p roblem and she needed my help. Her sister, Sarah, was missing. We were on ou r way to Sarah's apartment to find her when, halfway up the front steps of the  building, a man ran toward me and started punching me.

I hit the man in the ear. He screamed with pain. He  was small, but a tough son- of-a-gun. I stepped back and hit him hard in the st omach.

“Oh my God!” he moaned. I think I hurt him that tim e.

I knew he was in pain. I pushed him down to the gro und. He fell onto the grass in front of the steps to the apartment building. Now it was my turn to take control.

I stood over him and asked, “Who are you? What do y ou want?” He didn’t answer. He had a ski mask on, so I couldn’t see his  face.

“Just get the hell away from this apartment buildin g! You’re not welcome here!” he said.

I grabbed him by the shirt, pushed his face into the ground, and twisted his arm behind his back. He yelled even louder now. I think  he was finally ready to stop fighting.

“Now, who are you? Why can’t I go inside the apartm ent?” I was getting angry and wanted some answers. I saw a few people come ou t of the apartment building to see what was happening.

But the man still didn’t say a word. He lifted hims elf up suddenly and pushed me away. He looked at me coldly for a second, then ran  into the street.

I turned to find Anne to make sure she was okay. “D o you know who he was? Have you seen him before?” I asked.

“No, Dr. Reeves. I don’t come to my sister’s apartm ent very often. I don’t know who he is.”

Let me back up a minute: This morning in my office Anne had explained that two days ago she was supposed to have lunch with her si ster, Sarah Salas. When her sister didn’t come to the restaurant, Anne call ed Sarah’s apartment. There was no answer.

Anne went to her sister’s apartment right away and knocked on the door, but there was no one home. She called Sarah’s work. Sar ah’s boss told Anne that Sarah had been missing for two days. So Anne decide d to ask me to help find her sister and her sister’s husband, Bill, who was also missing.

# Missing Person, Part 2: ¡§Beer and Cigarettes.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 62 – Missing Person , Part 2: “Beer and Cigarettes.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 62. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the second in our 12-part special s eries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In part 1, we met Anne Prado, a stu dent at the University of Southwestern California in Los Angeles. Anne has a sister, Sarah Salas, but for some reason Anne can’t locate or find her sister. S he appears to have disappeared, or is missing.

Anne asked her professor, Dr. Reeves, to help her f ind her sister. The professor and Anne went over to Sarah’s apartment, but before  they could get to the door, Dr. Reeves was attacked by another man who started fighting with him. The man eventually ran away. We also learned that Sarah’s h usband, Bill, is also missing.

Now, part 2 of Missing Person : “Beer and Cigarettes.”   > Some of my students know I’m an amateur detective. Before I became a university professor five years ago, I had a real j ob. I worked for a security agency that protected private homes and also import ant people like famous actors and politicians. I learned a lot about crimi nals. I also learned a lot about police work from my father, who was a cop for 34 ye ars.
> I had wanted to become a police officer, too. But t hat was impossible. I got into some trouble when I was a kid. It was a stupid high  school trick, but because I was 18 years old, I was treated like an adult. I wa s arrested by the police, convicted, and now I have a police record. With a c riminal record, I can never be a cop.
> I worked for a while as a bodyguard. One of my case s was protecting a famous politician who was also a history buff. He and I be came friends, he helped me go to college, and now I am a professor.
> This episode begins with our narrator – the person telling the story, Dr. Reeves – talking a little bit about his own background. He s tarts by saying that he’s “an amateur detective.” An “amateur” (amateur) is someo ne who doesn’t necessarily get paid to do what they do. Someone who gets paid is called a “professional.” A “detective” is someone who tries to find a criminal  or tries to find information. Dr. Reeves explains that he has been a university profe ssor for five years.

Before that, he worked for “a security agency that protected private homes” and “important people.” A “security agency” is a compan y that provides protection for a business or a home or a person. We call someone w ho works for a security agency a “security guard.” The narrator also says t hat his father was a police officer for 34 years. The term he uses is “a cop.” A “cop” (cop) is an informal term meaning a police officer, someone working for the p olice.

Dr. Reeves also wanted to become a police officer, but something happened. He doesn’t tell us exactly what, but he says it was “a  stupid high school trick.” A “trick” (trick) is something that you do to someone  else, usually something mean, something bad. We don’t know what it was, but becau se he was 18 years old – which in the United States is the legal age – he wa s “treated like an adult.” “To treat someone like” is an expression we sometimes u se when talking about how we act toward someone. We might say, “Don’t treat m e like a child,” meaning don’t act toward me like I’m a child or talk to me like I am a child.

Dr. Reeves was “arrested by the police.” When the p olice “arrest” you, they put handcuffs on you and take you to the police station  – that’s where the police work, in a police station. Dr. Reeves was “convicte d” (convicted), meaning he went to a trial in front of a judge and a jury – the group of people who decide if you are innocent or not, if you did the crime or no t – and the jury said he was guilty. “To be found guilty” (guilty) is the same a s to be convicted. The opposite would be “to be acquitted.” “To be acquitted” means  you are found to be innocent, or not guilty.

Now Dr. Reeves has a police record. When we say som eone has a “police record” – a “criminal record,” or sometimes we just  say “a record” – we mean that they’ve committed some crime, and if you look up th at person’s name on the police computer, his name will come up along with the name of his crime. Having a “criminal record” or “police record” means that there are some jobs that you can no longer apply for or get, and becoming a cop, acc ording to Dr. Reeves, is one of those jobs.

The professor explains that he also worked as “a bo dyguard.” A “bodyguard” (bodyguard) is very much the same as a security gua rd, except when we say

“bodyguard,” we mean someone who is protecting a pe rson instead of a place. So, the president of the United States has bodyguar ds. We actually call those bodyguards “the Secret Service,” but for regular pr ivate citizens it would be a bodyguard.

Dr. Reeves was once the bodyguard for “a famous pol itician who was also a history buff.” A “buff” (buff) is a person who real ly likes a particular topic. So, you could be an “art buff,” meaning you like to go and look at art, or a “theater buff,” meaning you like to go to the theater – it’s like b eing a fan. Now, Dr. Reeves explains, because of this famous person whom he pro tected, he got interested in history and became a history professor himself.

We then return to the story, to the apartment of the missing couple, Sarah Salas and her husband, Bill. Dr. Reeves suggests to Anne that they go into the apartment and “take a look around.” “To take a look  around” can mean to look closely for a particular thing, often in a place th at you haven’t been to before. You can also “take a look around” without having someth ing you are looking for; you’re just looking. But here, Dr. Reeves and Anne are looking for clues about what happened to Sarah and Bill.

They go up to the apartment on the third floor. Ann e gets the key and gives it to Dr. Reeves. She says, “Here’s the key.” That’s an e xpression we often use when we give something to someone: “Here’s your pen,” “H ere is your . . .” whatever it happens to be. With the key, Dr. Reeves opens the d oor – very slowly, because it is “a stranger’s door.” A “stranger” is someone you don’t know.

The room is full of many expensive things, includin g “a big-screen television” – a television with a large screen – and “a fancy stere o.” Something that’s “fancy” is something that, in this case, is expensive. It has a lot of additional features and can do many different things – that would be someth ing that is fancy. A “stereo” here just means a radio, probably with a CD and MP3  player. Anne says that it “smells like beer and cigarettes” in the apartment,  and she points out that Bill and Sarah didn’t smoke.

The episode ends with Dr. Reeves going into the bac k of the apartment and mentioning how he looks in the mirror. He says that  he’s 42 years old, 5 feet 11 inches – and that’s how we say how tall we are: we say, “I’m 6 feet 3 inches” or “I’m 6 feet 3 inches tall” – they mean the same thi ng. That’s just an example. I am not actually 6 feet 3 inches tall, although sinc e you can’t see me, I could say that I was and you wouldn’t know the difference, wo uld you?

Dr. Reeves says that he’s “balding.” “To be balding ” (balding) means that you’re losing your hair. He checks the windows and the clo sets in the apartment and then begins to go into the bathroom. But he stops b ecause he sees something move. He then turns to Anne and puts his hand up in  the air. So, he takes his hand and indicates for Anne to stop. Then he puts h is finger to his lips, indicating that she should be quiet. Why? Because someone is i n the bathroom.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Some of my students know I’m an amateur detective. Before I became a university professor five years ago, I had a real j ob. I worked for a security agency that protected private homes and also import ant people like famous actors and politicians. I learned a lot about crimi nals. I also learned a lot about police work from my father, who was a cop for 34 ye ars.

I had wanted to become a police officer, too. But t hat was impossible. I got into some trouble when I was a kid. It was a stupid high  school trick, but because I was 18 years old, I was treated like an adult. I wa s arrested by the police, convicted, and now I have a police record. With a c riminal record, I can never be a cop.

I worked for a while as a bodyguard. One of my case s was protecting a famous politician who was also a history buff. He and I be came friends, he helped me go to college, and now I am a professor.

As I said, when Anne came to see me this morning, I  told her I would be happy to help. We came over to the apartment building where Sarah and Bill live, and that’s when this mysterious man tried to stop us fr om going in.

“Let’s see if we can get into their apartment and t ake a look around,” I suggested.

We walked into the large white building and up to the third floor. Anne got an extra key from the apartment manager so we could ge t in.

“Apartment number 306, Anne?” I asked her.

“Yes. Here’s the key,” she answered.

“Let me open the door.” I took the key from her. I opened the door very slowly. One thing I learned from my work as a bodyguard: Be  careful when opening a stranger’s door. You never know what’s behind it.

I opened the door slowly. I went in first, making s ure everything was okay before Anne followed. The living room was large and full of expensive things: a big- screen television, a fancy stereo, a CD player, two  big brown leather chairs, and a comfortable-looking sofa. The living room alone w as bigger than my entire apartment.

“My God, it smells like beer and cigarettes in here ! Bill and Sarah didn’t even smoke,” Anne said.

I walked to the back of the apartment and saw mysel f in the mirror. I am always surprised at how I look: I’m 42 years old, 5 feet 1 1 inches tall, balding, average weight. But when I see myself in the mirror, I look  3 inches shorter, 5 years older, and 10 pounds heavier.

I checked the windows and the closets on each side of the apartment and went into the bathroom. Then I saw something move.

I quickly turned to Anne and put my hand up in the air, meaning: “Don’t move.” I put my finger to my lips, telling her to be quiet.

Someone was in the bathroom.

[end of story]

In the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll find out what they discover in the bathroom. Be sure to come back for part 3: “A Woman  in Pain.”

# Missing Person, Part 3: ¡§A Woman in Pain.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 63 – Missing Person , Part 3: “A Woman in Pain.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 63. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the third of our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In the previous episodes of Missing Person , we learned that our narrator – the person telling the story, Dr. Reeves  – is a university professor and an amateur detective. One of his students asked him  for his help to find her missing sister, Sarah.

Dr. Reeves and the woman go over to the sister’s ap artment, and they find that there is nothing there – no evidence to tell them w hat happened. They then hear, at the very end of the episode, a noise coming from  the other side of the apartment: someone is in the bathroom. That’s where  we stopped our story in the second episode.

Now, we continue with episode 3 of Missing Person : “A Woman in Pain.” > I put my hand on my gun and slowly opened the door wider. I saw nothing. I carefully picked up a towel from the floor. Nothing . There must be someone in the bathroom, I thought.
> In one fell swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back . “Don’t move!” I shouted.
> Suddenly, a little white cat jumped out of the bath tub and scurried between my legs. A cat. I should have known.
> “Oh, Jasmine! I forgot about you!” Anne said. The c at looked happy to see her. She took her into the kitchen. I poked around the r est of the bedroom and then followed Anne into the kitchen.
> “Does the cat have any food left in her dish?” I as ked.
> “It’s almost gone. Poor Jasmine! You must be hungry .”
> Our episode begins with Dr. Reeves slowly opening the door to the bathroom with his gun in his hand. He says that “in one fell  swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back.” The expression “in one fell (fell) s woop (swoop)” means all in one action – when you do something quickly, all at the same time. We often use this expression when more than one thing happens because  of a single action. In this case, Dr. Reeves kicks the shower curtain back. You  have a shower curtain in a shower – the place where you bathe or clean yoursel f standing up – to prevent the water from going out onto the floor.

Dr. Reeves shouted into the bathroom, “Don’t move!”  Suddenly, “a little white cat jumped out of the bathtub.” The “bathtub” – all one  word – is a place where you can sit and take a bath. Sometimes we just call it “the tub” (tub). The cat “scurried” between Dr. Reeves’s legs. “To scurry” ( scurry) means to run quickly. Usually we describe an animal with short legs that runs quickly, like a cat, as an animal that scurries. If they move suddenly, we may  say they scurried. Often, “scurried” means that they’re trying to get away fr om you or get away from something.

Dr. Reeves says, “I should have known.” This is a very common expression in English, “I should have known,” which means “I shou ld have known better.” For example, I can say, “I should have known what was g oing to happen,” which means I had the knowledge or intelligence to know w hat was going to happen, but I didn’t use my brain enough to figure it out, to understand it. The cat’s name is Jasmine. Anne recognizes her, and the cat goes to Anne. Anne, remember, is the student of Dr. Reeves whose sister has gone mis sing.

Dr. Reeves says that he “poked around the rest of the bedroom” and then went into the kitchen. “To poke around” (poke) – in this  case the past tense, “I poked around” – means to look around. Usually when you are looking for something specific, or you are just trying to see what is the re, we use this expression. You could say, for example, “I poked around in my desk drawer, trying to find the scissors,” meaning I looked around, not necessarily  in an organized way.

Dr. Reeves asked Anne if the cat had any food left in her dish. Notice the expression, “Is there any food left (left)?” That m eans “Is there any food remaining?” When you say, “Is there any left?” you are asking or implying that there was some before and that it ran out, meaning there is no longer any left. The cat dish is, in fact, empty, so “Jasmine must b e hungry,” Anne says. Dr. Reeves concludes that Bill and Sarah haven’t been g one long since, of course, the cat is still alive, even though there is no foo d left in her dish.

Dr. Reeves walks over to the “answering machine” or  the “telephone answering machine.” That is, of course, a little machine you have connected to your phone to take messages; when people call you, they leave a message. But no one had called. He looked around more in “the three-bedroom  apartment.” We often use the number of bedrooms to describe an apartment, no t the square footage. In some countries they say, “Well, it’s 500 square met ers,” but in the United States, we usually talk about the number of bedrooms and ba throoms. “It’s a two- bedroom apartment,” or we might say, “It’s a two-be droom, two-bath apartment.” This is a three-bedroom apartment.

Dr. Reeves says that there was “no burglary, no bre ak-in.” A “burglary” (burglary) is when someone steals something from you. The pers on who steals something from you is sometimes called a “burglar” (burglar) – that’s the person who commits or does a burglary. A “break-in” is when so meone enters your house without you knowing it and without you obviously wa nting it. So, a burglar will often break in to a house. A break-in is just for a  house or an apartment – when a robber or someone trying to steal things goes into your apartment or house.

Dr. Reeves checks the master bedroom. “The master b edroom” is the name we give the main bedroom, the largest bedroom. If you’ re in a house with, say, two parents and three children, the parents would sleep  in the master bedroom – it’s the biggest bedroom. Next to the master bathroom is  often a master bath. That’s the bathroom that is usually inside or near a maste r bedroom. The things that Dr. Reeves saw – “a beer bottle,” “some dirty clothes” – didn’t seem unusual. He mentions “an old Time  magazine.” “Time ” is the name of a famous magazine in English that has been around – I don’t know how lon g – for several decades (a decade being, of course, ten years).

Dr. Reeves says that there are some pills on the ta ble, and he asks Anne, “What are these pills for?” When you ask someone, “What is this for (for)?” you mean “What is its purpose? Why is it here?” She says to Dr. Reeves that they were for Bill’s leg, because “he messed up his leg playing f ootball.” “To mess (mess) something up” means here that he hurt it. But you can also use the term “to mess up” when you make a mistake. You can say, “I messed  up. I made a mistake. I

did something wrong.” So, it can have both of those  meanings. The college where Bill played football was USC, which in this s tory means the University of Southwestern California.

Dr. Reeves can’t figure out what happened to Anne’s  sister and Anne’s brother- in-law. “A brother-in-law” is the person who is mar ried to your sister, and your “sister-in-law” is someone who is married to your b rother. The two missing people “seem to have just disappeared into thin air .” The expression “to disappear into thin (thin) air” means that there’s no clue as to what happened. You disappear so completely that no one knows what happened. Sometimes we use this expression when something disappears quick ly.

Dr. Reeves suggests to Anne that they go to the pol ice and talk to them. But Anne doesn’t want to. She says that she had gone to  the police already. They told her “to fill out some forms and wait.” “To fil l out a form” means to put some information on a piece of paper. Dr. Reeves then st ops and looks at Anne and says to himself, “This poor kid.” He doesn’t mean h ere that she doesn’t have any money. When we say “this poor person,” we mean “this unfortunate person,” when something bad has happened to them.

He describes her as “twenty-two” – meaning 22 years  old – “and in such pain.” “In such pain” here means “in a lot of pain.” Then a telephone rings. It is Anne’s cell phone, or mobile phone. She answers it, and he r face suddenly becomes very sad. She hangs up and says to Dr. Reeves, “Tha t was Bill. Something terrible has happened!”

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll find out what terrible thing happened.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I put my hand on my gun and slowly opened the door wider. I saw nothing. I carefully picked up a towel from the floor. Nothing . There must be someone in the bathroom, I thought.

In one fell swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back . “Don’t move!” I shouted.

Suddenly, a little white cat jumped out of the bath tub and scurried between my legs. A cat. I should have known.

“Oh, Jasmine! I forgot about you!” Anne said. The c at looked happy to see her. She took her into the kitchen. I poked around the r est of the bedroom and then followed Anne into the kitchen.

“Does the cat have any food left in her dish?” I as ked.

“It’s almost gone. Poor Jasmine! You must be hungry .”

“Well, Bill and Sarah haven’t been gone long, we kn ow that.” I walked over to the telephone answering machine and checked their messa ges. No one had called.

We continued looking through the three-bedroom apar tment. There was no sign of any violence, no burglary, no break-in. I checke d the master bedroom, and I saw nothing unusual – a beer bottle, photos of Bill  and Sarah’s wedding, some dirty clothes, an old Time  magazine.

Next to the bed, on the night table, there was a bo ttle of pills. “Anne, what are these pills for?”

“I think they’re for Bill’s leg. He messed up his l eg playing football in college at USC,” Anne replied.

I put the bottle back on the table and sat down on the bed to think. I had no idea what happened to Anne’s sister and her brother-in-l aw. They seem to have just disappeared into thin air. They didn’t call anyone.  There was no sign of any crime in their apartment. No one at their jobs had seen them for two days. Where could they be?

“Well, Anne, I don’t see anything here to help us. I think we should talk to the police again.”

“But I’ve tried the police, Dr. Reeves! They told m e to fill out some forms and wait. They won’t do anything. That’s why I went to you for help!” She began to cry a little.

I stopped and looked at her for a second. God, I th ought, this poor kid. Twenty- two and in such pain.

“Okay, well, we won’t find anything else here. Let’ s go,” I said to her.

 Just then I heard a telephone ringing. I turned to the phone on the table, but there was no sound. Then I saw Anne reach into her purse: it was her cellular telephone!

“That’s my cell phone, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said. “Hel lo?”

I watched Anne’s face as she answered the phone. Fi rst it was happy, then worried, then very sad.

“Right . . . 10 minutes . . . yes . . . see you the re . . . bye!” Anne hung up and looked at me in fear.

“That was Bill. Something terrible has happened!”

[end of story]

In episode 4 of Missing Person , “Meeting at the Café,” we’ll learn more about this terrible thing that happened.

For now, from Los Angeles, California, I’m Jeff McQ uillan. Thanks for listening. Come back and listen to us again here on ESL Podcas t.

# Missing Person, Part 4: ¡§Meeting at the Caf?.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 64 – Missing Person , Part 4: “Meeting at the Café.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 64. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the fourth in our 12-part special s eries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, Dr. Reeves and his student, Anne Prado, were in the bathroom of Anne’s sister, Sarah. Sarah and her husband, Bill, are missing. It turned out that the noise they heard in  the bathroom was just a little cat. So, they looked around the apartment and tried  to find something that would tell them what happened to Sarah and Bill.

Dr. Reeves noticed that there were some pills on the table next to their bed in the master bedroom. Those pills, according to Anne, wer e for Bill’s leg, which he had hurt playing football in college. Dr. Reeves told A nne that they should go to the police, but Anne said the police wouldn’t help. The n, at the end of the episode, Anne received a telephone call. When Anne got off the phone, her face was very sad, and she said, “Something terrible has happened !”

Now, we continue with part 4 of Missing Person : “Meeting at the Café.” > “We have to go, Dr. Reeves!” Anne said excitedly. “ That was Bill on the phone. He’s at a restaurant called Café Pico. Sarah’s been  kidnapped!”
> “Kidnapped? Are you sure?” I asked, somewhat incred ulously.
> “I’m sure. Someone has taken Sarah,” Anne replied. “Bill said that a man is holding her, and he will kill her if we don’t give him the ransom he’s demanding.” Anne was pulling me to the door of the apartment. “ Come on! Bill said he will explain at the restaurant.”
> I closed the door to the apartment and followed Ann e down the stairs and to my car. The weather was typical for Los Angeles: sunny , 75 degrees, with brown smog covering the city. L.A. is a city of dreams. B ut for some people, it’s a city of nightmares.
> Our episode begins with Anne trying to get Dr. Reev es out of the apartment as soon as possible in order to meet Bill at a café. B ill had called Anne and told her to come to a café to meet with him. Anne says to Dr . Reeves, “That was Bill on the phone.” The expression “that was” – and someone ’s name – “on the phone” means that is the person who just called. Bill told  Anne that Sarah had been “kidnapped.” “To kidnap” (kidnap) someone means tha t you take someone away and you ask for money in exchange for the person be ing returned unharmed, or safe.

“Are you sure?” Dr. Reeves says, “somewhat incredul ously.” “To be incredulous” is to doubt what another person is saying, to think  that what someone else is saying is probably not true. The adverb “incredulou sly” is how he asks the question – with some doubt. But Anne assures Dr. Re eves that Bill’s story is true.

She tells him that Bill said that a man would kill her sister, Sarah, if they didn’t give him the ransom he was demanding. “Ransom” (ran som) is the word for the money you give to someone who is a kidnapper, someo ne who kidnaps. The money that you pay is called “ransom,” and is usual ly used with the verb “to demand.” “To demand” is to say “You must do this” –  it’s like an order. Kidnappers demand a ransom.

Anne says to Dr. Reeves, “Come on!” The expression “Come on!” in this case means “Hurry up, follow me, come with me.” We also sometimes use that expression when we don’t believe something. Someone  tells us something that we don’t think is true, and we say, “Oh, come on,” meaning “That can’t be true. I don’t believe you.” It’s an informal phrase, someth ing you would say to a family member or a friend.

As they are walking to his car, Dr. Reeves says tha t it’s a typical day in Los Angeles: “sunny, 75 degrees, with brown smog coveri ng the city.” “Smog” (smog) is a word that comes from the words “smoke” and “fo g.” It generally means

pollution, which is why it’s brown, and this smog is “covering the city,” meaning it’s all over the city. Dr. Reeves says, “L.A. is a  city of dreams. But for some people, it’s a city of nightmares.” A “nightmare” ( nightmare) is a bad dream.

Anne and Dr. Reeves drive quickly down Robertson Av enue, which is a big street here in Los Angeles, and they try not to cause a “p ileup.” A “pileup” (pileup) is when a bunch of cars get into an accident. When we say, “There’s a pileup on the freeway,” we mean that several cars are involve d in a single accident. Dr. Reeves says that Anne looked “justifiably nervous.”  “Justifiably” is another adverb. The adjective “justifiable” (justifiable) m eans that it makes sense, that there is a good reason for something to happen. The  verb “to justify” means to give an explanation or to give a reason. So, “justi fiably,” as an adverb, means that it makes sense – that there is good reason for  her to be nervous.

Dr. Reeves says, “You could see it in her eyes.” In  this case, “to see it” means to notice something and to know that it’s true. Dr. Re eves can tell that Anne is nervous by looking in her eyes – he can see it in h er eyes. When Dr. Reeves and Anne arrive at the café, Anne introduces Dr. Reeves  to Bill. Dr. Reeves says, “It’s good to meet you,” which is a common expression whe n you’re first meeting someone: “It’s good to meet you” or “It’s nice to m eet you.” Bill responds by saying, “I’m glad to meet you, too.”

They sit down. Dr. Reeves says, “The waitress came over to take our order,” meaning she asked them what they were going to drin k or eat. Dr. Reeves orders a glass of iced tea and says, “I’m a bit of a caffe ine addict, truth be told.” “Caffeine” (caffeine) is something that is in coffe e and tea and some sodas. It’s a drug that makes you more awake and sometimes a litt le nervous.

An “addict” (addict) is someone who is addicted. the verb is “to be addicted,” and it means that your body needs a drug so much that y ou cannot live without it, the way some people become addicted to heroin or cocain e. Dr. Reeves isn’t actually addicted to caffeine, but he uses the term  “addict” because some people seem like they are addicted to caffeine. He also us es the expression “truth be told.” It’s somewhat of an old-fashioned expression . “Well, truth be told, I don’t really want to go to the movie.” It is used when yo u are being very honest – more honest than usual – with someone.

Anne asks Bill what happened to Sarah, and she asks  this question “impatiently” –another adverb. “To be impatient” (impatient) mean s that you can’t wait; you want to find out right away or do something right a way. And “impatiently,” as an adverb, is how she asks this question. Bill says th at a strange man had come to their door, and when Bill opened the door, “before I knew what was happening” –

before he could figure out what was going on – “he had a gun in my face and was shouting obscenities at me.” An “obscenity” (ob scenity) is a vulgar or bad word, a swear word – something that you would not s ay to someone you liked. This strange man was shouting obscenities at Bill.

Dr. Reeves asks Bill what this man looked like, and  Bill answers, “He was tall and muscular.” “Muscular” comes from the word “muscle,”  and means someone who has a lot of muscles. I’m not particularly muscular , for example. Bill says that the man was wearing a “ski mask,” and you’ll remember t hat a “ski mask” is a hat that covers your whole face so people can’t see who  you are. It is used by people to keep warm when they ski. He says that he thought  the man had a mustache, but “It all happened so fast.” The expression “it a ll happened so fast” means something took place, but you didn’t really have ti me to figure out what was going on.

Bill explains that the kidnapper took him and Sarah  and put them in a car and put a small towel around their eyes. When there is some thing around your eyes like that, we call that a “blindfold” (blindfold), all o ne word. If you have a blindfold over your eyes, you can’t see anything. Bill says they w ere then driven to another place and put into a small “dingy” room. The adject ive “dingy” (dingy) means something that is very dirty, and that has been dir ty for a long time. So, a “dingy room” would not be a very nice place.

Finally, Bill says that this morning, the kidnapper s had “let him go,” meaning they let him leave, and told him that if he wanted Sarah  to be free, he had to pay a ransom of $500,000.

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll learn more about the ransom demand made by the kidnappers.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

“We have to go, Dr. Reeves!” Anne said excitedly. “ That was Bill on the phone. He’s at a restaurant called Café Pico. Sarah’s been  kidnapped!”

“Kidnapped? Are you sure?” I asked, somewhat incred ulously.

“I’m sure. Someone has taken Sarah,” Anne replied. “Bill said that a man is holding her, and he will kill her if we don’t give him the ransom he’s demanding.”

Anne was pulling me to the door of the apartment. “ Come on! Bill said he will explain at the restaurant.”

I closed the door to the apartment and followed Ann e down the stairs and to my car. The weather was typical for Los Angeles: sunny , 75 degrees, with brown smog covering the city. L.A. is a city of dreams. B ut for some people, it’s a city of nightmares.

Anne and I drove down Robertson Boulevard in my old  red Mustang, going around cars as fast as we could without causing a p ileup.

“Where is this café again?” I asked her.

“On Robertson and Pico, next to a bookstore,” Anne answered. She was justifiably nervous. You could see it in her eyes.

Arriving a few minutes later, we found a place to p ark in front of the bookstore and walked into the café. Bill was there waiting for us.

“Bill! Oh my God, Bill, what happened?” Anne hugged  Bill, who looked tired and worried.

“Oh, this is my friend, Dr. Darren Reeves.” Anne sa id. “Dr. Reeves, this is Bill. Dr. Reeves is my professor at USC. But he’s also a very  good detective. When I found out that you and Sarah were missing, I went to him for help.”

“It’s good to meet you, Bill,” I said.

“Um, yeah, I’m glad to meet you, too,” Bill said.

Bill, Anne, and I sat down at a table in front of the café. The waitress came to take our order. I asked for a glass of iced tea. I’ m a bit of a caffeine addict, truth be told.

“Bill, tell us what happened to Sarah. Is she okay? ” Anne asked impatiently.

“Sarah is fine now,” Bill said. “But for a while, I  thought both of us would be killed. Two days ago, a strange man knocked on our door at the apartment. I opened the door, and before I knew what was happening, he had a gun in my face and was shouting obscenities at me.”

“What did he look like?” I asked.

 “He was tall and muscular,” said Bill, “but he wore  a ski mask, so I couldn’t see his face very well. He had a mustache, I think. It all happened so fast.”

“That’s okay. Go on,” I said.

“Well, the man took Sarah and me and put us in a ca r. He put a small towel around our eyes, tied our legs and hands together, and then drove us to another place. We were forced out of the car and into a sma ll, dingy room.

“We were given food twice a day. I’m not sure how m any kidnappers there were holding us there. I heard several voices outside the door, maybe three or four, I’m not sure. Finally this morning, about an hour a go, I was let go and given a message: If I want Sarah to be set free, I have to pay a ransom of $500,000.”

In the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll learn more about the ransom demand made by the kidnappers. Be sure to come back  for part 5: “No Police.”

# Missing Person, Part 5: ¡§No Police.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 65 – Missing Person , Part 5: “No Police.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 65. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the fifth of our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, Dr. Reeves and his student Anne Prado met with Bill. Bill is Anne’s brother-in-law. We learne d that Bill’s wife, Sarah – who is Anne’s sister – has been kidnapped and that the kid nappers are demanding a large ransom: $500,000. Bill said that both he and his wife were kidnapped, but that the kidnappers let him go so he could get the ransom money for his wife.

Now, we continue with part 5 of Missing Person : “No Police.” > “When does he want the money?” I asked.
> “Tomorrow. He said he would call me this afternoon and tell me where to make the drop,” Bill said. “He also made it crystal clea r that we are not to call the police. If I don’t hand over the money by the deadl ine, he said he’s going to kill Sarah!” Bill put his face in his hands. He turned to Anne, “Geez, Anne, I don’t know what to do!”
> “We’ll get the money, Bill, don’t worry!” Anne said . “You know that my parents left Sarah and me a lot of money when they died.” Anne p ut her hand on Bill’s shoulder.
> Anne and Sarah’s parents had owned a very large com puter company in Los Angeles, Prado Computers, Incorporated. When they d ied a few years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Prado left their two daughters a very larg e pile of cash. That’s how Anne got the money to go to USC and how she could a fford her cell phone, her Mercedes, and her apartment on the beach.
> While Anne and Bill comforted each other, I called the young waitress over and asked for another iced tea. She wasn’t very friendl y, but then most waitresses in L.A. aren’t. They all really want to be actresses.
> Our episode begins with Dr. Reeves, the narrator of  the story, asking Bill when the kidnappers want the money. Bill replies, “Tomor row,” and says that the kidnappers will tell him “where to make the drop.” “To make the drop” means to leave the money. The term “drop” (drop) is used by both criminals and police to mean money or information or something that is bein g left for someone else to pick up. So, the kidnappers will tell Bill “where to make the drop,” meaning where to leave the money.

Bill says that the kidnappers “made it crystal clea r” that they were not to call the police. “To make something crystal clear” means to make it very clear, so there is

no misunderstanding. A “crystal” (crystal) is a roc k that is like a piece of glass that you can see through. So, “crystal clear” means  very clear. Bill says that if he doesn’t “hand over the money by the deadline,” the kidnapper is going to kill Sarah. “To hand over” here means “to give.” It is u sually used in situations in which you don’t really want to give the other perso n the money or whatever it is they want. So, if a robber tells you, “Hand over al l your money,” it means “Give me all your money,” even if you don’t want to.

Bill then turns to Anne and says, “Geez Anne, I don ’t know what to do.” The expression “geez” (geez) is one of those expression s you might use when you’re confused or you’re upset or maybe you’re mad. For e xample, you might say, “Geez, I just missed my train this morning,” or “Ge ez, I wish I had seen that movie last weekend.”

Anne tells Bill that he shouldn’t worry about the m oney, because Sarah and Anne’s parents had left them a lot of money when th ey died. Our narrator, Dr. Reeves, then explains that Anne and Sarah’s parents  had owned a computer company in Los Angeles, and when they died, they le ft their two daughters “a very large pile of cash.” “Cash,” of course, is mon ey, and a “large pile” would mean a lot of money. A “pile” (pile) is a stack – w hen you put one thing on top of another. You can pile things up. You can have a pil e of paper, which would be many papers on top of each other. And when you say someone has a “pile of cash,” you mean they have a lot of money.

Anne and Bill then comfort each other. “To comfort”  someone is to talk to them, to sympathize with them, to try to help them. Dr. R eeves, meanwhile, asks the waitress for another iced tea. While he is drinking  his tea, he says, “The thought occurred to me that the kidnappers must know Anne a nd Sarah.” The expression “the thought occurred to me” is another way of sayi ng, “I thought.” It is a little more complicated way of saying the same thing. “The  thought occurred to me that I should go on vacation.” That would be the sa me as “I think I should go on vacation.” I do actually think I should go on vacat ion.

Dr. Reeves then asks Anne and Bill to think of any enemies they might have, people who might want to hurt them. Anne and Bill s pend the next 20 minutes “coming up with a list of people.” “To come up with ” something means to think about a problem or puzzle for a long time and then write or say whatever solutions you thought of. For example, “Come up wit h five people whom you really want to meet” means think about it and then either tell me or write down the names of those five people. You can also say, “ I came up with the answer,” meaning you thought of the answer after thinking ab out it for a while.

After making their list of people, Anne and Bill “g ot the list down to two prime suspects.” “To get something down to” means to redu ce it, to make it less. “At the Italian restaurant, I wanted to order lasagna and p izza and raviolis, but I couldn’t order all three, so I got it down to two choices: the pizza or the ravioli.” “To get something down to” means to reduce the number of so mething.

“Prime suspect” is a term we use for someone who ha s probably committed a crime or done something wrong. A “suspect” (suspect ) is someone who we think might have committed the crime. And the word “prime ” (prime) here means the number one or the most likely suspect. The two prim e suspects in this case are “ex-employees” or former employees – people who use d to work for Prado Computer, Incorporated. These two people had been “ fired” from the company. “To be fired” means to be told to leave your job, to be told that you can no longer work there.

Dr. Reeves tells Anne and Bill that they “need to g et some rest.” Notice that “rest” is used here as a noun and not as a verb. You could  tell someone, “You need to rest,” and in that case “rest” would be a verb. But  you could also say, as Dr. Reeves does, “You need to get some rest,” meaning y ou haven’t had enough rest and therefore, you need to rest more. Anne wan ts to go with Dr. Reeves, but Dr. Reeves says, “You need to get some rest and I n eed to look into these names you gave me.” Bill then adds, “No police,” me aning no police should be involved. Dr. Reeves agrees and says, “Not yet, any way.”

At the end of the episode, Dr. Reeves says, “I had a funny feeling that there was more to this mystery than any of us thought.” “To h ave a funny feeling” means to suspect or to think that there is something wrong. “I have a funny feeling that my neighbor is taking some of my roses at night,” mean ing I suspect that this is what is happening. I don’t know for sure, but that’s wha t I’m thinking. The expression “more to this mystery than any of us thought” means  there is something else going on here, something more that we don’t know ab out yet.

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll meet a friend of Dr. Reeves who will try to help him to solve or to find the answer to t his crime.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

“When does he want the money?” I asked.

“Tomorrow. He said he would call me this afternoon and tell me where to make the drop,” Bill said. “He also made it crystal clea r that we are not to call the police. If I don’t hand over the money by the deadl ine, he said he’s going to kill Sarah!” Bill put his face in his hands. He turned to Anne, “Geez, Anne, I don’t know what to do!”

“We’ll get the money, Bill, don’t worry!” Anne said . “You know that my parents left Sarah and me a lot of money when they died.” Anne p ut her hand on Bill’s shoulder.

Anne and Sarah’s parents had owned a very large com puter company in Los Angeles, Prado Computers, Incorporated. When they d ied a few years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Prado left their two daughters a very larg e pile of cash. That’s how Anne got the money to go to USC and how she could a fford her cell phone, her Mercedes, and her apartment on the beach.

While Anne and Bill comforted each other, I called the young waitress over and asked for another iced tea. She wasn’t very friendl y, but then most waitresses in L.A. aren’t. They all really want to be actresses.

Drinking my tea and thinking about the case, the th ought occurred to me that the kidnapper must know Anne and Sarah or at least know  that they had a lot of money and could get it quickly.

“I know this is a difficult time, Bill,” I interrup ted, “but I need to ask you and Anne a few questions. Does your family have any enemies?  Anyone who might want to hurt you?” Anne looked at Bill, and they both began  to think.

The two of them spent the next 20 minutes coming up  with a list of people who might want to harm them. They got the list down to two prime suspects, both of whom used to work for the Prado Computer business b efore they were fired. They gave me the names of the two ex-employees.

“This will be a good place for me to start,” I told  them. “Now, you two need to get some rest. I’ll drive you both back to Bill’s apart ment.”

“No, Dr. Reeves, I want to go with you!” Anne insis ted. I found it very hard to say no, but I had to. I needed time to be alone and to get some advice from an old friend.

“I’m really sorry, Anne,” I apologized, “but you ne ed to rest and I need time to look into these names you gave me.”

 “No police!” Bill quickly added.

“Don’t worry, Bill,” I told him, “there’ll be no po lice involved. Not yet, anyway.”

The three of us got up and started walking toward m y car. I had a funny feeling that there was more to this mystery than any of us thought.

[end of story]

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll meet a friend of Dr. Reeves who will try to help him solve the mystery. Be sure to come back for part 6: “Kathy (Again).”

# Missing Person, Part 6: ¡§Kathy (Again).¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 66 – Missing Person , Part 6: “Kathy (Again).”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 66. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the sixth in our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, we learned that the kidnappers of Anne’s sister, Sarah, have demanded a large ransom, or a l arge amount of money, and have said not to call the police. We also learned t hat Anne and Sarah’s parents had owned a large computer company and left their d aughters with a lot of money when they died.

It occurred to our narrator, Dr. Reeves, that the k idnappers must know Anne and Sarah in order to know that they could get a lot of  money very quickly. Dr. Reeves asked Anne and Sarah’s husband, Bill, to mak e a list of possible suspects – people who might have committed this cri me – and they came up with the names of two former employees of their parents’  computer company. Then, at the end, we found out that Dr. Reeves has his su spicions and thinks something might be wrong here.

Now, we continue with part 6 of Missing Person : “Kathy (Again).” > I drove Bill and Anne back to Sarah and Bill’s apar tment building to drop them both off there. Anne had left her car there, so she  could drive herself home. I told them to call me if anything new came up.
> “Thanks for your help today, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said . “I know you’ll help us find my sister.” She gave me a big long hug.
> I didn’t linger there with Anne, as much as I wante d to reassure her that things would work out. I needed to talk to an old friend, Kathy Chang, about what happened today. We were supposed to have dinner at 5:30 at her apartment, and it was already 5:20. Kathy hates it when I’m la te.
> I drove to Kathy’s apartment and I snagged a parkin g spot in front of her building. It was 5:45 and I was late. I knocked on the door a nd Kathy let me in.
> Our episode begins with Dr. Reeves dropping Anne an d Bill off at Sarah and Bill’s apartment. (Remember that Bill is Sarah’s hu sband, and Sarah is still missing; Anne is Sarah’s sister.) “To drop someone off” means, usually, to drive them somewhere and then leave them there. You can d rop a person off. You can also drop off a thing or an object. “I have to drop  off my glasses to be fixed” means I have to take my glasses to the repair store  and leave them there.

Dr. Reeves tells Anne and Bill that if anything com es up, they should call him. When we talk about something “coming up,” we mean “ if anything happens.” It could be a positive thing or it could be a negative  thing. Sometimes you might say, “I’m sorry I was late. I couldn’t be there on time because something came up,” meaning something happened that prevented me f rom doing what I wanted to do.

 Anne then gives Dr. Reeves “a big long hug.” A “hug ” (hug) is when you put your arms around someone – usually a friend, though it c ould also be your wife or your husband or your girlfriend – and you pull thei r body close to yours. You could also say “embrace,” which means the same thin g.

Dr. Reeves says that he didn’t “linger” there with Anne, even though he wanted to “reassure her that things would work out.” “To l inger” (linger) means to stay somewhere for a long time. Often, when you linger, you’re waiting for something to happen. “To reassure” (reassure) means that some one has doubts or is perhaps afraid of something, and you want to make them believe that everything is going to be okay. So, “to reassure” here means t hat Dr. Reeves is trying to tell Anne that everything is going to be okay.

Another way of saying that everything is going to b e okay is to say that “things will work out.” When we talk about “things working out,” we mean that there will be a positive result. The opposite would be “things  didn’t work out,” meaning there was a negative result. You might say, for exa mple, “I hired a new employee, but she was very lazy so I had to fire or  get rid of her. Things didn’t work out with that employee.” “To work out” also ha s another meaning, as a verb meaning “to exercise.” So, you could say, “I’m goin g to the gym today to work out,” or “Next week, I will definitely work out.”

Dr. Reeves goes to see an old friend of his, Kathy Chang. The two of them “were supposed to have dinner at 5:30.” When we say “were  supposed to have,” we mean that you were planning on it, or it was schedu led. Dr. Reeves “snagged a parking spot” in front of Kathy’s building. “To sna g a parking spot” means to find or to get a parking spot, and a parking spot is a p lace for your car. It is the same thing as a “parking space.”

Dr. Reeves knocks on the door and Kathy lets him in . “To let someone in” means to open a door and allow someone to come inside. Ka thy is mad at Dr. Reeves, so Dr. Reeves decides to change the subject. “To ch ange the subject” means to start talking about something else. If you’re havin g an argument with your wife or your husband and you don’t want to talk about it an ymore, they may say, “Don’t change the subject. You know what we’re talking abo ut.” So, “to change the subject” means to talk about something different.

We find out that Dr. Reeves’s first name is Darren.  Darren decides to change the subject and asks, “What are we having for dinner?” which means “What are we eating for dinner?” Kathy is upset and says, “You c ome late and now you want dinner?” But then she says, “How much are you willi ng to pay me?” with “one of

her inviting smiles” on her face, meaning she’s not  really upset. When you say something is “inviting,” we mean that it is temptin g, that it is something that you would want to have. It’s clear here that Kathy is f lirting with Darren. “To flirt” (flirt) means to say things or do things to make the other person think that you are romantically interested in them.

Dr. Reeves explains that he and Kathy “stopped dati ng over a year ago.” “To date” means to go with someone – to be romantically  involved with someone. Dating comes before you are married. Another phrase  for dating is “going out.” “Megan and I are going out” means “We are dating.” “We are seeing each other” is another expression. “Are you seeing anyone?” mea ns “Are you dating anyone?” or “Are you going out with anyone?”

Darren says that “deep down,” he thinks Kathy is st ill in love with him. The expression “deep down” refers to what you really th ink to be true about something. So, “Deep down, I really love chocolate, ” even though I may say I don’t like it. It’s sort of like a very private or secret truth. Darren says that he has feelings for Kathy, as well. “To have feelings for”  someone means that you’re interested in the other person romantically, but pe rhaps not as much as the other person is interested in you.

Kathy then says, “Time for dinner. Let’s dig in.” “ To dig (dig) in (in)” – two words – is an informal phrase that means to start eating. D arren explains that Kathy is a reporter, and at the end of his description he says , “One more thing about Kathy.” “One more thing” means there is one additional thin g he wants to say about Kathy – and it is that she’s a great cook. “Let’s e at, big guy,” Kathy says, and so they do. The expression “big guy” here is something  that a woman might say to a man. She’s saying, “You’re a big strong man,” that sort of thing.

On the next episode of Missing Person : a shocking new development.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I drove Bill and Anne back to Sarah and Bill’s apar tment building to drop them both off there. Anne had left her car there, so she  could drive herself home. I told them to call me if anything new came up.

“Thanks for your help today, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said . “I know you’ll help us find my sister.” She gave me a big long hug.

I didn’t linger there with Anne, as much as I wante d to reassure her that things would work out. I needed to talk to an old friend, Kathy Chang, about what happened today. We were supposed to have dinner at 5:30 at her apartment, and it was already 5:20. Kathy hates it when I’m la te.

I drove to Kathy’s apartment and I snagged a parkin g spot in front of her building. It was 5:45 and I was late. I knocked on the door a nd Kathy let me in.

“You’re late, Darren – as usual,” Kathy said.

I knew I was late, but Kathy and I have known each other for many years. I didn’t want to hear about all of the other times I was lat e, so I changed the subject. “I’m glad to see you, too, Kathy. What are we having for  dinner?”

“Dinner? You come late and now you want dinner?” sh e replied. “How much are you willing to pay me?” She had one of her inviting  smiles on her face.

“All I have is yours,” I said jokingly. I think I b roke the ice with that one.

Kathy and I stopped dating over a year ago, but she  still likes to pretend that we’re going out. I meet her every week for dinner, and I play along with the joke. Deep down, though, I think she’s still in love with  me. I admit I have feelings for her, as well. But life keeps interfering . . .

“Okay, time for dinner. Let’s dig in.” Kathy quickl y brushed her long black hair from her face, got up, and went into the kitchen.

Kathy was a reporter for Los Angeles’s biggest tele vision station. She was both very smart and very beautiful. I met her at a confe rence in Hawaii about six years ago. She was now my best friend in Los Angeles. One  more thing about Kathy: she is a great cook.

“Let’s eat, big guy,” she said. And so we did.

# Missing Person, Part 7: ¡§An Accident?¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 67 – Missing Person , Part 7: “An Accident?”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 67. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the seventh in our 12-part special series: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, Dr. Reeves  took Anne and Bill back to Bill and Sarah’s apartment building and then went to see his old friend, Kathy. He was late, and Kathy was not very happy, but she let  him into her apartment where she had made dinner for them.

We also found out that Kathy and Dr. Reeves – or “D arren,” as Kathy calls him – used to date each other, and that Dr. Reeves thinks  that Kathy is still in love with him. Kathy works as a reporter for a television sta tion. At the end of the episode, Kathy and Dr. Reeves were just about to sit down an d eat their dinner.

Now, we continue with part 7 of Missing Person : “An Accident?” > Kathy came back in the room with tonight’s dinner: Italian pasta with chicken. As we ate, I told Kathy about Anne and her missing sis ter.
> “A strange man came to Sarah and Bill Salas’s apart ment building two days ago, forced them both into a car, and took them away,” I  explained. “Today, the man let Bill go and told him to get a half a million do llars or he would kill Sarah.”
> “And how did you get mixed up in all this?” Kathy a sked.
> “Sarah’s sister Anne is my student at USC. She aske d me to lend her a hand, and I said yes.”
> “So, who do you think the kidnappers could be?” she  asked.
> “Well, Bill and Anne gave me the names of two ex-em ployees of Prado Computers. I’m going to see one of them tonight.”
> “Where does this person work?” Kathy asked.
> Our episode begins with Dr. Reeves – or “Darren,” a s Kathy calls him – telling Kathy the story of what happened to Sarah and Bill Salas. He says a strange man “forced them both into a car and took them away .” “To force” (force) someone means to make someone do something that the y wouldn’t normally do, perhaps by using some sort of violence against them . “The man took them away,” meaning he transported them somewhere else, and then he “let Bill go” – meaning he let Bill leave – “and told him to get a half a million dollars.”

Kathy asks how Dr. Reeves got “mixed up in all this .” When we say “I’m mixed up in” something, it means there is some sort of compl ication or problem and I have somehow gotten myself involved in it. So, Kathy is asking “How did you get involved in this?” meaning involved in this problem . And Dr. Reeves explains that Sarah’s sister, Anne, is his student and she had as ked him “to lend her a hand.” “To lend someone a hand” means to help someone, to give someone some assistance. “Here, let me lend you a hand,” means “ Let me help you.”

Dr. Reeves explains that he is “going to see” two e x-employees of Prado Computers who are possible suspects – people who ma y have kidnapped Sarah. When we say we’re “going to see” someone, we mean t hat we’re going to visit or meet with them. Kathy asks where one of these ex-em ployees works, and Dr. Reeves says, “He works at a bar.” A bar is where so meone can go and get an alcoholic drink.

Kathy says that this person isn’t the one who took Sarah. Dr. Reeves asks, “Why?” and she says, “Trust me.” The expression “Tr ust (trust) me” means “Believe me; I know the truth.” Kathy says that the  man who took Sarah “is smart – very smart,” and “smart men don’t work at bars.” Dr. Reeves says that he has to go, but that he will call Kathy tomorrow if he f inds out anything. “To find out anything” means to discover or learn something. He says, “I trust Kathy’s judgment.” When someone says “I trust your judgment  (judgment),” it means that he believes your opinion is correct; he believes yo u. “Judgment” here means an opinion about something.

Dr. Reeves says that he “drove his car down La Brea .” “To drive your car down the street” means to drive your car on the street, but we don’t say we drove “on the street” –  we say we drove “down the street.” I n this case, Dr. Reeves drove his car down one of the big streets here in Los Ang eles, called “La Brea.”

Suddenly, he hears “an announcement on the police s canner.” “A scanner” (scanner) is a radio that can receive or “pick up” signals from police or fire or emergency vehicles. Dr. Reeves has this police scan ner in his car, which is illegal in many cities in the United States. But if  you have a police scanner, you can hear all of the communication between the polic e officers. He says that he “immediately pulled over.” To “pull over” means to park your car on the side of the road.

Dr. Reeves “cranked up the volume.” “To crank” (cra nk) or “to crank up” means to increase or to turn up the volume. It’s an infor mal expression. Somebody might say, “Crank it up!” meaning “Turn the volume up!” O n his police scanner, Dr. Reeves hears about “an accident on the freeway invo lving a black Mercedes.” An accident “involving (involving) a black Mercedes” m eans an accident in which one of the vehicles, one of the cars in the acciden t, is a black Mercedes.

The woman in the car is hurt, and Dr. Reeves listen s to the description of the woman. She’s a “young Latina female.” “Latina” (Lat ina) or “Latino” describes a person who is from Mexico or one of the many Spanis h-speaking countries in Central America and South America. It could also de scribe someone from other

areas where Spanish is spoken, like Puerto Rico. It  is an expression or term that we use to describe someone of that ethnic backgroun d.

The other word we also use sometimes is “Hispanic.”  “Hispanic” and “Latino” (for a man or a boy, “Latina” for a woman or a girl) mea n the same thing. The woman involved in the accident is Anne Prado. And Anne is , you’ll remember, Sarah’s sister – the one who went to Dr. Reeves and asked h im for his help.

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll learn more details of Anne Prado’s car accident.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Kathy came back in the room with tonight’s dinner: Italian pasta with chicken. As we ate, I told Kathy about Anne and her missing sis ter.

“A strange man came to Sarah and Bill Salas’s apart ment building two days ago, forced them both into a car, and took them away,” I  explained. “Today, the man let Bill go and told him to get a half a million do llars or he would kill Sarah.”

“And how did you get mixed up in all this?” Kathy a sked.

“Sarah’s sister Anne is my student at USC. She aske d me to lend her a hand, and I said yes.”

“So, who do you think the kidnappers could be?” she  asked.

“Well, Bill and Anne gave me the names of two ex-em ployees of Prado Computers. I’m going to see one of them tonight.”

“Where does this person work?” Kathy asked.

“He now works at a bar near the airport.”

“He’s not the person who took Sarah,” Kathy said co nfidently.

“Why do you say that? I haven’t even talked to him yet,” I said, surprised.

“Trust me. The man you want is smart – very smart. Smart men don’t work at bars.”

 Kathy was probably right. I thanked her for the won derful dinner and told her I would call her tomorrow if I found out anything. Ev en though I trust Kathy’s judgment, I decided to go visit this former employe e anyway, just to be sure he wasn’t the one who took Sarah.

I drove my car down La Brea. Suddenly I heard an em ergency announcement on the police scanner in my car. The radio picks up al l of the police communication in the city. I had it put into my car so I could he ar any important police action related to my cases. I immediately pulled over and cranked up the volume.

There was an accident on the freeway involving a bl ack Mercedes. The woman in the car was hurt. I listened closely to the name  as the radio operator gave the details: young Latina female, age 22, name – Anne P rado.

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll learn more about the car accident that Anne Prado was involved in. Be sure to come ba ck for part 8: “Tracing the Plates.”

# Missing Person, Part 8: ¡§Tracing the Plates.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 68 – Missing Person , Part 8: “Tracing the Plates.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 68. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the eighth in our 12-part special s eries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, our narrator – Dr . Reeves – was having dinner at the apartment of his friend and ex-girlfriend, K athy. He told Kathy about the case of the missing woman, Sarah Prado, and said th at he had two suspects: two ex-employees of the company that Sarah and Anne  Prado’s parents used to own.

After leaving Kathy’s apartment, Dr. Reeves decided  to go and talk to one of the ex-employees at a club – a bar – near the airport. As he was driving to the airport, however, he heard on his police scanner, o r police radio, a message about a car accident on the freeway involving his s tudent, Anne Prado.

Now, we continue with part 8 of Missing Person : “Tracing the Plates.” > “Be careful! She might have broken bones,” the ambu lance driver yelled.
> I arrived at the accident scene just a few minutes after the police. Anne was already in the ambulance and ready to go to the hos pital.
> “Wait just one second,” I said to the police office r closing the back door of the ambulance. “I’m a friend of the victim. Can I talk to her?”
> “Okay, go ahead,” she said, “but hurry up.”
> “Thanks.” I turned and looked at Anne. She had hurt  her arm and leg, but she was awake and able to speak. “Anne,” I said softly.  “Anne, it’s me, Dr. Reeves.”
> Anne opened her eyes slowly. “Dr. Reeves, wha – wha t are you doing here?”
> “I heard about the accident on my police scanner. A nne, what happened?”
> The title of this episode is “Tracing the Plates.” “Plates” (plates) here refers to the license plates on a car. “To trace (trace) the plat es” means to talk to the police, who can then find out who the car belongs to by loo king up the license plate number on a computer.

As Dr. Reeves arrives at the scene of the accident on the freeway, the ambulance driver yells, “Be careful! She may have b roken bones.” An “ambulance” (ambulance) is a truck that transports people who are sick or hurt and need to get to the hospital right away. It “tra nsports” them, meaning it takes them there. Most cities in the United States have a n ambulance system. Usually the ambulances have what are called “paramedics.” A  “paramedic” (paramedic) is not a doctor, but someone who is trained to help  sick or injured people until they can get to the hospital.

Dr. Reeves asks the police officer if he can talk to Anne, saying, “I’m a friend of the victim.” A “victim” (victim) is someone who has  had something bad happen to them, such as a crime. You can also be a victim of a natural disaster like a hurricane or an earthquake. The police officer says , “Go ahead, but hurry up.” “To hurry up” means to do something quickly. Dr. Re eves says softly to Anne, “Anne it’s me.” To say something “softly” is to low er your voice, to speak in a quiet voice like this. Dr. Reeves asks Anne what ha ppened, and Anne tells him that a red car going very fast hit her “from behind ,” meaning it hit the back of her car.

Anne was lucky enough to get the license plate numb er of the car that hit her, and she gives the number to Dr. Reeves. The policew oman then tells Dr. Reeves that he has to go. She says, “Okay buddy, you’ll ha ve to go now.” “Buddy” (buddy) is a word used to refer to a guy or a man. Technically, a “buddy” is a friend, but people also use it with strangers, like  when we say, “Hey, buddy!” It often has a slight negative connotation or negative  meaning when it’s used like that. Dr. Reeves says that he “jumped out of the am bulance and it drove away.” “To jump out of the ambulance” means to get out of the ambulance very quickly.

He then makes a call from a pay phone. A “pay phone ” is not a very common thing anymore. It’s a public telephone where you ca n pay to make a call. There are still pay phones in the United States, but beca use almost everyone has a cell phone now, they’re not as popular. Dr. Reeves calls  the police department and

tells the operator, “Get me Officer Cho,” meaning “ I want to talk to Officer Cho. Put him on the line.” Because he is a police office r, he is called “Officer Cho.” If I were a police officer, I would be called “Officer M cQuillan.” I’m not a police officer, of course.

Dr. Reeves says that he needs “some information on a car registration.” “Car registration” means who the car is registered to. I n the United States, you have to register any car you own. So, there is a record – there’s a file – with your name and your car’s license plate number. Dr. Reeves tel ls Officer Cho that he’ll call him back in an hour. At the end of the conversation , he tells Officer Cho, “You’re the best!” meaning “You’re great. You are the best at what you do.”

Dr. Reeves then goes to the bar by the airport. He goes into the bar and talks to the bartender. A “bartender” (bartender) – all one word – is the person who works behind the bar serving drinks. He asks the bartende r if he knows Lenny McKay, and the bartender says, “I never heard of Lenny Mac Kay. . . .There ain’t no Lenny McKay working here.” The expression “there ai n’t no” is an informal expression. It means the same as “there isn’t any,”  but the word “ain’t” is very informal and not something you should use at work o r at school.

Well, Dr. Reeves doesn’t believe the bartender, so he goes over to a door with a sign that says “DO NOT ENTER” and he opens the door . “Do not enter” means “Do not go in,” but Dr. Reeves opens the door anywa y, and he finds Lenny McKay. He asks Lenny where he was two days ago at 8 :30 in the morning, and Lenny says that he was in Las Vegas with his girlfr iend. “Las (Las) Vegas (Vegas)” is a big city in the state of Nevada where  people go to gamble. Dr. Reeves says, “I believed Lenny when he told me that  he was in Vegas.” Sometimes, as Dr. Reeves does here, we call Las Veg as simply “Vegas.” “He was in Vegas” is the same as saying “He was in Las Vegas.”

Dr. Reeves decides to check Lenny’s story by talkin g to Lenny’s girlfriend, Tanya. Tanya responds, “What do you want, bud?” “Bud” (bud ) here is the same as “buddy.” It is a shortened form of buddy, and it’s not a very polite thing to say – it has a somewhat negative meaning. Dr. Reeves asks wh ere she was two days ago, and she says, “Who wants to know?” Again, that  is a not very polite and somewhat challenging thing to say. You might say th at to someone when you don’t want to give them much information about your self.

Dr. Reeves explains that he’s “investigating a girl  who’s gone missing.” “To go missing” means to be missing, to be lost, to have d isappeared. He says he wants to “clear someone of suspicion.” “Suspicion” (suspi cion) is when you think that someone is guilty of doing something wrong, and “to  clear someone of suspicion”

means to provide evidence or proof that they didn’t  do anything wrong. Tanya says that she was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend, Lenny, and Dr. Reeves thanks her and then decides to drive home.

When he gets home, he checks his voice mail. “Voice  mail” is where you can leave someone a telephone message. Dr. Reeves has o nly one message, from “a man with a very deep voice” – meaning a very low  voice – who tells him to stop trying to find Sarah Salas, and that if he doe sn’t, he will die.

On the next episode of Missing Person , Dr. Reeves investigates another one of his suspects.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

“Be careful! She might have broken bones,” the ambu lance driver yelled.

I arrived at the accident scene just a few minutes after the police. Anne was already in the ambulance and ready to go to the hos pital.

“Wait just one second,” I said to the police office r closing the back door of the ambulance. “I’m a friend of the victim. Can I talk to her?”

“Okay, go ahead,” she said, “but hurry up.”

“Thanks.” I turned and looked at Anne. She had hurt  her arm and leg, but she was awake and able to speak. “Anne,” I said softly.  “Anne, it’s me, Dr. Reeves.”

Anne opened her eyes slowly. “Dr. Reeves, wha – wha t are you doing here?”

“I heard about the accident on my police scanner. A nne, what happened?”

“A . . . a car . . . red car . . . going very fast . . . hit me. Hit me from behind . . . tried to kill me . . .” It was difficult for her to  talk.

“A red car, Anne?” I asked, hoping to get more info rmation. “Did you see the driver?”

“No . . . didn’t see . . . but . . . I got the lice nse plate . . . 3XZW . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 1,” she said, running out of breath.

 “Anne, that’s wonderful! Good work!”

“Thanks, Dr. Reeves.” She smiled a little and touch ed my hand softly.

“Okay, buddy, you’ll have to go now,” the policewom an yelled. “She needs to get to the hospital.”

I jumped out of the ambulance and it drove away. I got back in my car and drove to the nearest pay phone. I had to find out who own ed that car.

“Hello, police department? Yes, get me Officer Cho. ” Cho was an old friend of mine. When I needed a favor, he was always willing to help.

“Cho? This is Darren Reeves. Yeah, look, I need som e information on a car registration. License number 3XZW451 . . . right, I ’ll call you back in an hour. Thanks, Cho. You’re the best.”

It was now 7:45 p.m. and I still needed to talk to one of the ex-employees of Prado Computers who worked at a bar near the airpor t. I drove down the freeway and arrived about 20 minutes later.

When I got to the bar, I walked inside. It smelled of old beer, old cigarettes, and old men. I sat down at the bar and ordered a drink.  I was here to speak to Lenny MacKay, an ex-employee of Prado Computers.

“Excuse me, bartender,” I said to the man serving the drinks, “I’m looking for Lenny, Lenny MacKay.”

“I never heard of Lenny MacKay,” he answered very q uickly. “You got the wrong place. There ain’t no Lenny MacKay working here.”

I looked into his eyes, and I knew he was lying.

I got up from the bar and walked to the back of the  place. There was a door to the left. The door had a sign on it that said, “DO NOT ENTER.” I entered.

“Hey!” A man yelled at me as I went into the back r oom. “Who are you?”

“I’m looking for Lenny MacKay. Are you Lenny?”

“Yeah, I’m Lenny. Now who are you?” he replied.

 “My name’s Reeves. Look, I’m not here to waste your  time. I just want to ask you a few questions. Now, where were you two days ago a t about 8:30 in the morning?”

“I was in Las Vegas with my girlfriend. Ask her. Sh e’ll tell you that I was with her.”

I believed Lenny when he told me that he was in Veg as, but I needed to be sure. “Who’s your girlfriend? What’s her name?” I asked.

“Her name is Tanya. She’s working here tonight. You  can ask her!”

I walked over to a table and found a girl sitting b y herself, drinking a beer. “Are you Tanya?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’m Tanya. What do you want, bud?”

“I just have a quick question for you: Where were y ou two days ago?”

“Who wants to know?”

“I’m investigating a girl who’s gone missing, and I  just want to clear someone of suspicion, that’s all.”

“I was in Las Vegas with my boyfriend, Lenny. Lenny  MacKay.”

“That’s all I needed to know. Thanks.” I walked out  of the bar and got back into my car. As usual, Kathy was right: Lenny wasn’t inv olved in the kidnapping.

I got back on the freeway and drove to my apartment . It was now 10:30 p.m. and I was tired. I needed to sleep before I could conti nue my investigation. As soon as I got into my apartment, I checked my voice mail  for messages. There was only one. It was from a man with a very deep voice.

The message was short but very clear: “Darren Reeve s, stop trying to find Sarah Salas! If you don’t stop looking for her now, you w ill die!”

On the next episode of Missing Person , Dr. Reeves investigates another person who may have kidnapped Sarah Salas. Be sure to come  back for part 9: “At the Beach.”

# Missing Person, Part 9: ¡§At the Beach.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 69 – Missing Person , Part 9: “At the Beach.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 69. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the ninth in our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, we learned that A nne, the sister of the kidnapped woman, was in a car accident. Fortunately , she was able to get the license plate number of the car that hit her, and s he gave the information to Dr. Reeves. He called his friend Officer Cho, of the Lo s Angeles Police Department, and asked him to find out whom the car belongs to.

Dr. Reeves then went to see one of the suspects in the crime – an ex-employee of Prado Computers named Lenny MacKay – to find out  where he had been at the time of the kidnapping. Lenny didn’t really wan t to speak with him, but finally told him that he had been in Las Vegas with his gir lfriend. Dr. Reeves talked to the girlfriend, who said the same thing – that they  had been in Las Vegas. Dr. Reeves then went back to his apartment, where he fo und a message on his voice mail that said, “Darren Reeves, stop trying to find Sarah Salas! If you don’t stop looking for her now, you will die!”

Now, we continue with part 9 of Missing Person : “At the Beach.”

[start of the story]

So now someone wanted to kill me. But how did anyon e know I was working on this case? Was Lenny part of this kidnapping in som e way? I still had more questions than I had answers about this case.

I called my friend Officer Cho back at the police s tation. He had the car registration information I requested earlier. The m ysterious red car that hit Anne last night on the freeway belonged to John Costello , age 37, living in Santa Monica. Tomorrow I would visit Costello. Tonight, I  just needed to get some sleep.

The next morning I got up early and went to visit A nne in the hospital. Luckily, she was doing just fine. I told her I would pick he r up later in the afternoon and give her a ride home.

 First, I went to visit June Brown, the other ex-emp loyee of Prado Computers that Anne and Bill thought might be involved in the kidn apping. She now worked at a clothing store on the beach, Stern’s Fashions. I lo ve going to the beach in L.A. The sun is always shining, the surfers are riding the waves, and the people all look so beautiful, just like movie stars.

I walked into the clothing store and looked around.  The customers were mostly college students. “Excuse me, miss?” I said to the young sales clerk. “I’m looking for one of the employees here, a June Brown?”

“Who’s looking for her?” she asked, a little suspic ious.

“My name is Darren Reeves. I just wanted to ask her  a few questions.”

“What kind of questions do you want to ask her?” sh e replied.

“Just some questions. Look, is June Brown here toda y or not?” I was getting impatient with this girl.

“I’m June Brown, and I don’t know if I want to answ er your questions, mister.” She crossed her arms and looked at me with a very u nfriendly face. “Who do you work for? The police?”

“No, I don’t work for the police. I’m a, eh . . . p rivate detective,” I answered. “I just want to know where you were three days ago, in the morning. Can you just tell me that?”

“I don’t remember. I think I was with my boyfriend, ” she said with a smile. “Yeah, that’s right, I was with my boyfriend.”

“Can I talk to your boyfriend?”

“No, you can’t,” she said, suddenly getting very an gry.

“Why not?” I asked.

“Because he doesn’t want to talk to you!” June said . “Look, buddy, I don’t have to answer your questions. Now why don’t you just get o ut of my store?” She turned around and walked away.

I couldn’t force her to talk to me, so I didn’t try . I left the store and got back in my car. Maybe this girl was involved in the kidnapping . Maybe she and her boyfriend were trying to get even with Prado Computers. Maybe , maybe, maybe.

[end of story]

Our story begins with Dr. Reeves wondering who migh t have called and left him that threatening message. He asks, “Was Lenny part of this kidnapping in some way?” meaning “Was Lenny somehow connected with this kidnapping?” He says that he has “more questions than answers about this  case.” This is a common construction in English: “more” something “than” so mething else. He calls Officer Cho and finds out that the red car that hit Anne – that is, that crashed into Anne’s car – belongs to someone named “John Costello.” “To  belong to” means to be owned by.

Dr. Reeves then visits Anne in the hospital, and he  tells her that he will “pick her up later in the afternoon and give her a ride home. ” “To pick someone up,” means to go meet someone at their house or wherever  they are – in this case, the hospital – and to drive them somewhere. Dr. Ree ves is going to “give her a ride home.” “To give someone a ride home” means to drive the person back to his or her home.

After visiting Anne, Dr. Reeves goes to find the ot her ex-employee of Prado Computers. Remember, in the last episode he visited  Lenny MacKay, an ex- employee of Prado Computers, the company that Anne and Sarah’s parents had owned. The other ex-employee’s name is June Brown, and she works at the beach in Los Angeles, probably Venice Beach.

Dr. Reeves says he loves going to the beach in L.A.  because “the sun is always shining” and “the surfers are riding the waves.” A “surfer” (surfer) is someone who stands on top of a long board – a “surfboard” –  and literally tries to ride on the waves. The waves are the water moving toward the beach, and the surfers can actually stand on top of the waves with their b oards. That’s what “to surf” means, and there are a lot of surfers here in Los A ngeles.

When Dr. Reeves goes into the clothing store to fin d June Brown, he asked the sales clerk – the woman who works there – “Excuse m e, miss?” If you are an adult and you’re talking to a younger woman, you mi ght refer to her as “miss,” although you can actually say “miss” for a woman of  any age. If you’re trying to get a woman’s attention in a store or in a restaura nt, you might say, “Excuse me, miss.”

Then Dr. Reeves says he’s “looking for one of the e mployees here, a June Brown.” Notice the use of the indefinite article “a ” – “a June Brown.” He could just say, “I’m looking for one of the employees here, Ju ne Brown,” but you’ll often hear people put an “a” in front of the name when th ey’re asking about someone, particularly if they are looking for someone whom they haven’t met before. So, you could go into a restaurant and say, “I’m lookin g for a Mr. Smith,” meaning “I’m looking for Mr. Smith.”

The woman doesn’t want to answer his question, so,  Dr. Reeves says, “Look, is June Brown here today or not?” The word “look” is u sed in this way when you’re getting angry or impatient and you want the person to listen to you very carefully, to pay attention to what you are saying. He asks if  Julie Brown is “here today or not,” meaning “Is she or isn’t she – yes or no?” So metimes, informally, we might say, “Is she here or what?” “Or what” means the sam e as “or not,” but it’s much more informal.

The woman says, “I’m June Brown, and I don’t know i f I want to answer your questions, mister.” The word “mister” (mister) refe rs to an adult male, but in this particular usage, it sort of has a negative meaning . It expresses a certain impatience or dislike. For example, “Now look here mister, I don’t want you here.” It’s not a positive use of the word. The woman then  “crossed her arms,” meaning she linked her two arms together in front of her ch est. She then asks, “Who do you work for? The police?” Dr. Reeves says he’s a “ private detective,” which is someone who helps people solve crimes and does othe r things that the police would normally do.

June Brown says that she was with her boyfriend on the morning of the kidnapping, and Dr. Reeves says, “Can I talk to you r boyfriend?” She becomes angry and says, “He doesn’t want to talk to you!” T hen she says, “Look, buddy, I don’t have to answer your questions.” “Buddy” (budd y) or simply “bud” (bud) is another word for “guy,” and here again, it has a ne gative meaning to it. It’s something you would probably say to someone you’re angry with or don’t like. She tells Dr. Reeves, “Now why don’t you just get o ut of my store,” which is the same thing as telling him to leave her store.

Dr. Reeves leaves the store. He is still puzzled. H e doesn’t know if the girl was involved or not. He thinks, “Maybe she and her boyf riend were trying to get even with Prado Computers.” “To get even (even) with” so meone means that when someone does something wrong to you, you do somethi ng wrong to them in return. It’s like a type of revenge, when you try to get back at or hurt someone who has hurt you. But, of course, Dr. Reeves doesn’ t really know the truth. He ends by saying, “Maybe, maybe, maybe.”

 On the next episode of Missing Person , Dr. Reeves tries to find the man who hit Anne Prado.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of the story]

So now someone wanted to kill me. But how did anyon e know I was working on this case? Was Lenny part of this kidnapping in som e way? I still had more questions than I had answers about this case.

The sun is always shining, the surfers are riding the waves, and the people all look so beautiful, just like movie stars.

I walked into the clothing store and looked around.  The customers were mostly college students. “Excuse me, miss?” I said to the young sales clerk. “I’m looking for one of the employees here, a June Brown?”

“Who’s looking for her?” she asked, a little suspic ious.

“My name is Darren Reeves. I just wanted to ask her  a few questions.”

“What kind of questions do you want to ask her?” sh e replied.

“Just some questions. Look, is June Brown here toda y or not?” I was getting impatient with this girl.

“I’m June Brown, and I don’t know if I want to answ er your questions, mister.” She crossed her arms and looked at me with a very u nfriendly face. “Who do you work for? The police?”

“No, I don’t work for the police. I’m a, eh . . . p rivate detective,” I answered. “I just want to know where you were three days ago, in the morning. Can you just tell me that?”

“I don’t remember. I think I was with my boyfriend, ” she said with a smile. “Yeah, that’s right, I was with my boyfriend.”

“Can I talk to your boyfriend?”

“No, you can’t,” she said, suddenly getting very an gry.

“Why not?” I asked.

“Because he doesn’t want to talk to you!” June said . “Look, buddy, I don’t have to answer your questions. Now why don’t you just get o ut of my store?” She turned around and walked away.

I couldn’t force her to talk to me, so I didn’t try . I left the store and got back in my car. Maybe this girl was involved in the kidnapping . Maybe she and her boyfriend were trying to get even with Prado Computers. Maybe , maybe, maybe.

# Missing Person, Part 10: ¡§The Bartender Shows Up.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 70 – Missing Person , Part 10: “The Bartender Shows Up.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 70. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the tenth in our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, we learned that the person who hit Anne's car is named John Costello. Remember, Anne’s sister Sar ah was kidnapped; Anne and her brother-in-law, Bill, are trying to get her  free; and our narrator, Dr. Reeves – a university professor turned private dete ctive – is helping Anne to find her.

Dr. Reeves also went to talk to another former empl oyee of Prado Computers, the company that Anne and Sarah’s parents owned bef ore they died. Unfortunately, he was not able to get any informati on from the ex-employee, a woman named June Brown. He went down to the beach to talk to her at the store where she works, but she didn’t want to tell him an ything. So, he’s very frustrated and he’s very confused.

Now, we continue with part 10 of Missing Person : “The Bartender Shows Up.” > It was time to try a different approach. I decided to find John Costello first and talk to him. I wanted to find out why his car hit A nne’s and almost killed her. I knew Costello lived in Santa Monica, so I drove up the freeway and got off near Main Street. I went to the address Officer Cho gave  me and knocked on the door. No one answered. I knocked on the apartment manager ’s door. An old woman answered. “Excuse me, I’m trying to find John Coste llo. He lives in number 503.”
> “Mr. Costello lived – past tense – in 503. He moved  out two months ago,” she said.
> “Do you know where he lives now or where he works?”  I asked.
> “I don’t know where he moved to, but I think he sti ll works at the bar on 4th Street.”
> Episode 10 of Missing Person  begins with our narrator, Dr. Reeves, going to fin d John Costello, the man who hit Anne Prado’s car and  put her in the hospital. Dr. Reeves has an address for John Costello in Santa Mo nica, so he drives there and knocks on the door of the apartment, but “no on e answered,” meaning no one came to the door. So, he goes to see the apartm ent manager – the person who takes care of the apartment building – and he s ays he’s trying to find John Costello.

Dr. Reeves says, “He lives in number 503,” meaning he lives in the apartment with the number 503. The manager tells Dr. Reeves t hat John Costello “lived – past tense – in 503.” She says “past tense” to emph asize that the verb “lived” is in the past tense, because John Costello no longer lives there. “He moved out two months ago,” she says. “To move out” is similar  to the verb “to move,” and means to leave the place where you live, to pack up  all your things and go somewhere else. The manager doesn’t know where he m oved, but she thinks he still works at a bar on 4th Street in Santa Monica.

So, Dr. Reeves decides to go and find John Costello  at his work. As he’s walking up to the bar, he hears two gunshots. A “gunshot” ( gunshot) is when a bullet is fired from a gun. Dr. Reeves pulls out his own gun,  which he says is “registered” (registered), meaning the police know that he has the gun. In the United States, in the states where you’re allowed to carry a gun ( and not all states allow you to carry a gun) you have to register your gun; you hav e to fill out a form and be approved to carry a gun. Dr. Reeves says that his g un is registered.

He goes into the bar and he sees that there is a de ad body on the floor. He says the floor “was covered with blood,” meaning there w as so much blood that it was all over the floor. A man yells, “Don’t shoot!” This is what you say when someone has a gun. “Don’t shoot” (shoot) means “Don’t shoot  me.” Dr. Reeves says, “It’s okay, I’m a private detective,” and the man in the bar says, “Someone just shot John.” It turns out that the dead man is John Coste llo, the man Dr. Reeves was looking for.

Dr. Reeves asks if anyone saw who shot John Costell o, but “everyone just shook their heads.” “Shook” (shook) is the past tense of “shake” (shake), and “to shake your head” is to turn your head side to side, left to right, a couple of times to mean “no.” The opposite of “to shake your head” wou ld be “to nod your head,” which is to move your head up and down to mean “yes .” But the men at the bar all “shook their heads” to indicate that they didn’ t know what happened.

Dr. Reeves decides to leave before the police arriv e, and he goes to his favorite sushi bar to have lunch and to think about the case . A “sushi bar” is a place where they serve a popular kind of Japanese food ca lled “sushi” (sushi). Some sushi is made with raw fish, but not all. The “sush i bar” is a long counter behind which the “sushi chefs” stand and make the sushi. You sit in front of the chefs, and they make your sushi right for you. Even though  it is called a “bar,” it isn’t the kind of bar where they mainly serve alcohol, althou gh they often also serve alcohol at a sushi bar.

In any case, Dr. Reeves is “more confused than ever ,” meaning more confused than before, and says he is “stuck.” “To be stuck” (stuck) can mean to be physically unable to move – for example, if you’re in a car accident and your door won’t open, you might say, “I’m stuck in the car!” But it can also mean to be confused and unsure of what to do next, which is wh at Dr. Reeves means when he says, “I was stuck.”

He goes to pick up Anne at the hospital, and they d rive over to Bill and Sarah’s apartment. There are police cars outside of the apa rtment, and of course, both Dr. Reeves and Anne are worried. Dr. Reeves tells A nne to “try to stay calm,” meaning “try to stay relaxed, don’t get excited.” U nfortunately, they receive some very bad news. They learn from Bill that Sarah is d ead; her body was found in front of the apartment building. Bill says that he “made a terrible mistake” and decided to call the police and tell them everything , even though the kidnappers had told him not to call the police.

Bill is crying because his wife has just been found  dead, and Anne, who is Sarah’s sister, is also very much affected by this news. She begins to have difficulty walking, and it “looked like she was going to fall down,” meaning it looked like she was going to fall on the ground. At  the end of the episode, Dr. Reeves says, “I had tried my best,” meaning he had done the best that he could, but he still “blamed” himself, meaning he felt that  he had done something wrong, that he was somehow at fault. But then he says, “Yo u can’t blame yourself,” meaning there’s nothing more he could have done.

As he is “about to leave,” meaning as he was just g oing to leave, he looks at the names on the apartment building mailboxes. He says sometimes you “get lucky.” “To get lucky” means to have something good happen to you, something fortunate. He says, “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” m eaning he looked at something and it was so incredible that he doubted it was tru e. He can’t believe his eyes because one of the names on the mailbox list is “Jo hn Costello” – the man who had just been killed at the bar. And now there are two bodies to explain: John Costello as well as Sarah Salas.

On the next episode of Missing Person , Dr. Reeves confronts a killer.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

It was time to try a different approach. I decided to find John Costello first and talk to him. I wanted to find out why his car hit A nne’s and almost killed her. I knew Costello lived in Santa Monica, so I drove up the freeway and got off near Main Street. I went to the address Officer Cho gave  me and knocked on the door. No one answered. I knocked on the apartment manager ’s door. An old woman answered. “Excuse me, I’m trying to find John Coste llo. He lives in number 503.”

“Mr. Costello lived – past tense – in 503. He moved  out two months ago,” she said.

“Do you know where he lives now or where he works?”  I asked.

“I don’t know where he moved to, but I think he sti ll works at the bar on 4th Street.”

“Thanks for your help.” I got back in my car and dr ove down to the bar. It was only 10:00 a.m., and already there were cars parked  outside the place. Some people like to start drinking really early.

As I walked down the street toward the bar, I heard  two gunshots. I immediately reached for my gun, which I keep on my belt. The gu n is registered, of course, but I only carry it with me when I think there migh t be trouble. I ran toward the bar and I heard another sound, like the wheels of a car  turning very fast. I slowly opened the front door of the bar and looked around.  There was a man standing over a dead body. The floor was covered with blood.

“Don’t shoot!” the man yelled at me.

 “It’s okay, I’m a private detective. What happened here?” I asked.

“Someone just ran in here and shot John! I think he ’s dead,” the man answered.

“John? The dead man’s name is John?” I asked.

“Yeah, he is – was – the bartender. His name’s John  Costello.”

“Someone call the police,” I said. “Did anyone reco gnize the man who shot Costello? Did anyone see what he looked like?” Ther e were four men at the bar. Each man looked at the others. Everyone just shook their heads.

“Uh, I really didn’t see him very well,” said one m an.

“Yeah, it’s dark in here. I didn’t see his face,” s aid another.

I decided not to stay at the bar. I didn’t want the  police to find out about Sarah’s kidnapping and how Costello may have been connected . I drove back toward downtown.

I stopped to have lunch at my favorite sushi bar an d thought about the case. I was now more confused than ever. This morning I gue ssed that John Costello might be the kidnapper. Now Costello was dead. The girl at the beach store might be involved, but I had no evidence of that. I  was stuck. At around 2:00 p.m. I went to the hospital and picked up Anne. She was feeling much better and was happy to see me.

“Have you heard anything from Bill about giving the  money to the kidnappers?” I asked her.

“No, Bill hasn’t called.”

“Well, let’s get over there and see what happened.”  We drove over to Bill and Sarah’s apartment, and we were surprised to see two  police cars outside the building. Bill was sitting on the steps of the buil ding, crying.

“What happened?!” Anne said to me as we parked the car. “Why are the police here?”

 “I don’t know, Anne,” I said. “Let’s just try to st ay calm and find out what is going on.” As we walked toward the apartment building, I had a feeling in my stomach that something was wrong – very wrong.

“Oh, Anne, she’s dead! She’s dead!” Bill cried. He jumped up to hug Anne. “Sarah’s dead!”

“Bill, what happened?” I asked. “Did the kidnappers  call?” I saw that Anne was in shock. She couldn’t believe what Bill was telling h er.

“No, I made a terrible mistake,” Bill said. “I got scared, so I called the police this morning. I told them everything. I told them that S arah had been kidnapped. Then two hours later . . . she was dead! I found Sa rah’s body in the street in front of the apartment building!”

Bill began to cry again, and Anne looked like she w as going to fall down. I grabbed her arm and helped her sit down on the step s. I turned to the police officer standing next to us. “Where was the body fo und?” I asked.

“In the street, like Mr. Salas said,” he answered. “We got here about 30 minutes ago. She was already dead. She had been cut in the throat by some type of knife or piece of glass.”

It was over. I had tried my best, but Sarah was now  dead. I thought about all the things that had happened. I even blamed myself. May be I should have . . . But you can’t blame yourself. Sometimes, you just have bad luck. There was nothing more I could do. I shook hands with Bill and gave A nne one last hug. I decided I would call my friend Officer Cho and tell him what I knew. Maybe they could find the person who killed Sarah.

As I was about to leave, I noticed a list of names on the mailboxes of Bill and Sarah’s apartment building. I don’t know why I deci ded to look at the list. Sometimes you just do the right thing at the right time and get lucky. This was one of those times. I recognized one of the names o n the list. I couldn’t believe my eyes, so I looked more closely a second time. Ye s, I was right. The name on the list read “Costello, John – Apt. 1A.” John Cost ello lived in the same building as Bill and Sarah Salas.

[end of story]

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll learn the identity of Sarah’s killer. Be sure to come back for part 11: “Right on Schedul e.”

# Missing Person, Part 11: ¡§Right on Schedule.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 71 – Missing Person , Part 11: “Right on Schedule.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 71. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the eleventh in our 12-part special  series: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In the previous episode, our narrat or – Dr. Reeves – was trying to find John Costello, the man who had injured Anne  in a car accident. Dr. Reeves went to the address that he had for John Cos tello, but found out that he didn’t live there anymore. So he went to the bar wh ere John Costello worked, but just as he arrived, there were gunshots, and he fou nd John Costello on the floor of the bar, dead.

Dr. Reeves didn’t wait for the police to arrive, bu t instead went to pick up Anne at the hospital. They drove back to Bill and Sarah’s a partment building and found police cars outside and Bill crying on the front st eps. Bill, you’ll remember, is Sarah Salas’s husband. Bill told Anne and Dr. Reeve s that Sarah was dead, and that her body had been found in front of the buildi ng. Anne, of course, was very upset at this news. Dr. Reeves looked at the apartm ent’s mailbox list and discovered that John Costello, the man who was just  killed, had lived in the same building as Bill and Sarah Salas.

Now, we continue with part 11 of Missing Person : “Right on Schedule.” > Things were starting to make sense to me now. I was  beginning to see what had really happened to Sarah Salas and why she was kill ed. But I had no proof to show that I was right. I needed to get some real ev idence.
> I went home and rang up Kathy Chang. I asked her to  do me a big favor that night. Fortunately, she said yes. Now I was ready. I turned on the television and watched the baseball game; I had some time to kill until it was dark outside. When it was nighttime, I got in my car and started driving.
> When I got near Bill and Sarah’s apartment building , I turned off the lights of my car and parked about a block away. I didn’t want an yone to know I was here. It was now 7:30 p.m. I was right on schedule.
> We begin this episode with Dr. Reeves saying, “Thin gs were starting to make sense to me now.” “To make sense” (sense) means tha t something that was confusing before is now understandable or clear to you. He said he “was beginning to see what had really happened to Sarah Salas and why she was

killed.” But he has a problem: he has “no proof” to  show that he is right. “Proof” (proof) is evidence or data or something that shows  that you are correct, that what you are saying is true.

Dr. Reeves goes home and rings up his old friend an d ex-girlfriend, Kathy Chang. “To ring (ring) up (up)” – two words – means  to call someone on the telephone. In the story, it is used in the past ten se: “I went home and rang up Kathy Chang.” “Rang” (rang) is the past tense of ri ng. So, he rang up or called Kathy Chang, and he asked her to do him a big favor . “To do someone a favor” (favor) means to give someone help with something. Dr. Reeves asks Kathy to do him a big favor, and she says yes.

He then decides to watch television because he has “some time to kill.” “To have time to kill” means to have extra time, to have tim e to waste. So, for example, if you have an appointment at noon – at 12:00 p.m. – a nd it’s only 11:00 a.m. and you don’t have anything to do until your appointmen t, you have “some time to kill.” You have some time that you can “waste,” mea ning to not spend on anything very useful. Dr. Reeves has some time to k ill, so he watches a baseball game, and when it is “nighttime” (nighttime) – all one word, and just another way of saying “night” – he drives back to Bill and Sara h’s apartment building.

Remember, this is also the apartment building where  John Costello, the man who was killed in the bar, lived. Dr. Reeves arrives at  the apartment building at 7:30 p.m. “I was right on schedule,” he says. The expres sion “right on schedule” – three words: right (right) on schedule (schedule) –  means exactly on time. For example, if you were planning on being somewhere at  a certain time, and you arrive there at exactly that time, you are “right o n schedule.” So, “to be right on schedule” means to have things going just as you pl anned, just as you expected.

Dr. Reeves gets out of his car and walks up to the front of the apartment building. He needs to “break into” John Costello’s apartment.  “To break (break) into” means to go into a place – a house, a building, an apartment – where you do not have permission to enter. A criminal or a burglar –  anyone who wants to steal something from you – can break into your house or b reak into your car, and when someone does that, it is called a “break-in.” You could say, “I had a break- in last night,” meaning someone broke into my house . Usually people break in to steal something, to take something that isn’t their s.

When Dr. Reeves gets to the apartment, he notices t hat there is a light on, and so he takes out his gun and makes sure that he has bullets. “Bullets” (bullets) are the pieces of metal that a gun shoots. A gun shoots  bullets, and that’s how it hurts you or kills you. He begins to open the front  window “which was already

cracked open.” When we say that a window is “cracke d” (cracked) open” – two words – we mean that it’s open a little bit. It’s o pen a very small amount; there is a very small opening.

Dr. Reeves enters the apartment and sees a light on  in the kitchen, and he decides to surprise or to catch the person who is i n the apartment. Remember, this is John Costello’s apartment, and he’s dead, s o whoever is in the apartment is not John Costello. Dr. Reeves surprises the man by shouting, “Don’t move!” This is what the police would say to someone who wa s trying to run away from them: “Don’t move!” meaning “Don’t go anywhere.” the man turns around, and it’s Bill – Sarah’s husband.

Bill “took the frying pan he was holding and hurled  it” at Dr. Reeves. A “frying pan” – two words, frying (frying) pan (pan) – is a large, heavy, flat pan used to cook things like eggs or fish. Bill “hurled” the fr ying pan at Dr. Reeves. “To hurl” (hurl) means to throw something with great force, u sually at someone else. He hurls the frying pan at Dr. Reeves’s face. Dr. Reev es “ducked down.” “To duck” (duck) as a verb means to lower your head or to get  down close to the ground in order to avoid being hit. If someone throws somethi ng at you, you “duck down” so that it goes over you and doesn’t hit you. There  is also a bird called a “duck,” but here, as a verb, it means to get down near the ground.

When the pan misses Dr. Reeves, Bill comes at him. “To come at” someone means to run toward someone with the intention or the idea of fighting or hurting them. So, the two men fight. They are hitting each other when, suddenly, Dr. Reeves sees his gun on the floor next to them. He r eaches for the gun. “To reach for” something means to stretch your arm out to try  to grab the thing with your hand. But Bill gets to the gun before him, and he s tands up and points the gun at Dr. Reeves. “To point a gun” means to aim it in the  direction that you want to shoot it.

Bill says to Dr. Reeves, “So you figured out the tr uth.” “To figure out” means to solve a problem by thinking about it. Then he says,  “But you will just get a bullet in your head. That’s your reward for being so smart .” A “reward” (reward) is like a prize, and of course, it’s not really a prize when someone shoots you in the head. Bill looks at Dr. Reeves with what he describes as “real hatred.” “Hatred” (hatred) is the noun related to “hate” (hate), and hate is the opposite of “love.” Hate is a very strong, negative feeling about someone or some thing.

At the end of the episode, Dr. Reeves doesn’t know what to do, but then he remembers something: he remembers the pills that he  had seen in Bill and Sarah’s apartment the other day. The pills are for Bill’s bad leg that he injured

playing football in college. A “bad leg” is an inju red leg – a leg that hurts or that isn’t completely healthy. Bill has a bad leg, and h e takes medicine for the pain.

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll find out what Dr. Reeves does.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Things were starting to make sense to me now. I was  beginning to see what had really happened to Sarah Salas and why she was kill ed. But I had no proof to show that I was right. I needed to get some real ev idence.

I went home and rang up Kathy Chang. I asked her to  do me a big favor that night. Fortunately, she said yes. Now I was ready. I turned on the television and watched the baseball game; I had some time to kill until it was dark outside. When it was nighttime, I got in my car and started driving.

When I got near Bill and Sarah’s apartment building , I turned off the lights of my car and parked about a block away. I didn’t want an yone to know I was here. It was now 7:30 p.m. I was right on schedule.

Very quietly, I walked up the sidewalk in front of the apartment building. I needed to break into Costello’s apartment, which was on the first floor. I looked into the apartment through the window. There was a light on.  I took out my gun and made sure I had bullets in it. I slowly began to open the front window, which was already cracked open. After about a minute, I got the window open and stepped inside the living room of the apartment.

I saw a light on in the kitchen. There was someone in there, and this time it was no cat. I walked to the kitchen door; I needed to s urprise the person if I was going to catch him. As I opened the door, I yelled as lou d as I could, “Don’t move!” The man turned around suddenly. I had guessed right: it  was Bill.

“What?! What are you . . .” Before he finished his sentence, Bill took the frying pan he was holding and hurled it toward my face. I ducked down and the pan flew over my head.

Bill came at me. He pushed me to the ground and hit  me in the stomach. I hit him back in the face. We hit each other several times, until I noticed that my gun was now on the floor next to us. I stopped hitting Bill  and reached for the gun. But Bill

saw what I was doing and jumped up. He grabbed the gun before I could get it in my hands and pointed it at me.

“Don’t move, Reeves.” Bill had a big smile on his f ace. I was not smiling.

“So you figured out the truth, eh?” Bill said. “You  think you’re so smart, don’t you, Reeves? Well, you were right. I did kill Sarah, and  now I will get all of her money. But you will just get a bullet in your head. That’s  your reward for being so smart.”

Bill looked at me with real hatred. I have seen men  kill before. I know the look in their eyes before they kill. I knew that I didn’t h ave much time to think of something. Bill stood in front of me with the gun p ointed at my face. Suddenly I remembered the pills I had found in Bill and Sarah’ s bedroom for Bill’s bad leg.

Now I knew what to do.

[end of story]

On the next and final episode of Missing Person , we’ll find out what Dr. Reeves decides to do. Be sure to come back for part 12: “K athy to the Rescue.”

# Missing Person, Part 12: ¡§Kathy to the Rescue.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 72 – Missing Person , Part 12: “Kathy to the Rescue.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 72. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is the last in our 12-part special ser ies: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In our previous episode, we found out that  the person who had kidnapped and killed Sarah Salas was her own husban d, Bill. We also found out that John Costello, the bartender who was shot and killed at his work, lived in the same apartment building as Bill and Sarah Salas.

Our narrator, Dr. Reeves, went over to Bill and Sar ah’s apartment building and broke into John Costello’s apartment, where he surp rised Bill. The two men fought, and at the end of the episode, Bill had Dr.  Reeves’s gun and was going to shoot him. But Dr. Reeves suddenly remembered the p ills that he found in Bill and Sarah’s apartment – pills for Bill’s bad leg. “ Now,” he said, “I knew what to do.”

Now, the final episode of Missing Person : “Kathy to the Rescue.” > Without thinking for another second, I kicked Bill in his right knee. He screamed in pain and fell backward onto his back. The gun fe ll to the ground. I picked it up and pointed it at Bill.
> “The game is over, Bill,” I said, moving the gun cl oser to his face. “I know that you killed John Costello, too. Was he your partner in kidnapping Sarah?”
> “Costello was an idiot. He was supposed to kill Ann e and then keep quiet. But he told me he wanted more money or he would tell the p olice everything he knew. So I had to kill him so he wouldn’t blab to the cop s.”
> “And you came to Costello’s apartment tonight to ge t rid of any evidence that connected you to him?” I asked.
> In this final episode of Missing Person , we find out how the story ends. The title of this episode is “Kathy to the Rescue.” “To rescu e” (rescue) someone means to save them from trouble – to help when they are in d anger or need help. So, “Kathy to the Rescue” means that Kathy is going to come and help Darren Reeves, our narrator.

The episode begins in the middle of a fight between  Bill and Dr. Reeves. Bill has Dr. Reeves’s gun and is pointing it at him. Then Dr . Reeves remembers that Bill has a bad leg, so he kicks Bill in the knee. The “k nee” (knee) is the joint that connects your upper leg to your lower leg. So, he k icks Bill in the knee, and Bill screams in pain and falls “backward.” “To fall back ward” (backward) means to fall in the direction of your back. “To fall forward,” is to fall facedown, to your front. Bill falls “backward onto his back.”

 The gun that Bill was holding falls to the ground, and Dr. Reeves picks it up. Now Dr. Reeves points the gun at Bill and says, “The ga me is over, Bill,” meaning “This is it. I know what you did, and it all stops now.” Dr. Reeves continues, “I know that you killed John Costello, too. Was he you r partner in kidnapping Sarah?” A “partner” (partner) in this case is someo ne you are working with, someone who is helping you.

Bill says, “Costello was an idiot. He was supposed to kill Anne and then keep quiet.” But Costello failed to kill Anne, and then he told Bill he “wanted more money or he would tell the police everything he kne w.” So, Bill says he had to kill him “so he wouldn’t blab to the cops.” “To blab” (b lab) means to give information to. It’s an informal way of saying that he’s going to tell the police some secrets. “To blab” is usually used when someone tells someon e else about a secret when they’re not supposed to.

Bill killed Costello and then he went to Costello’s  apartment “to get rid of any evidence.” “To get rid of” means to destroy, to thr ow away, to make disappear. Bill needs “to get rid of any evidence.” “Evidence”  (evidence) is proof; it is something that would show that Bill and John Costel lo were partners. Costello has Bill’s name “written on a sheet of paper.” A “s heet (sheet) of paper” is the same as a piece of paper. Bill says he needed to fi nd this sheet of paper and get rid of it.

Just then, Kathy Chang knocks on the door, and Dr. Reeves says, “Kathy! Right on time!” “To be right on time” means to arrive exa ctly when you are supposed to. So, “right on time” means the same as “exactly on time.” It means you are here exactly when I expected you to be here. Dr. Re eves asks Kathy if she called the police, and she says, “Yes, they’re on their wa y here right now.” “To be on one’s way” means to be traveling to a particular pl ace.

Kathy is a reporter, and she says that she has “a c ameraperson from the television station outside.” A “cameraperson” (came raperson) is the person who operates the video camera. The police arrive and ar rest Bill Salas. “To arrest” (arrest) is what the police do when they take someo ne to jail. If you are arrested, you will have to defend yourself in court with a ju dge and lawyers and so forth. So, the police arrest Bill Salas for the murder of his wife and for the murder of his partner, John Costello.

Dr. Reeves says that Anne – Sarah’s sister – “would  be devastated.” “To devastate” (devastate) means to destroy, to ruin, to break something apart until there is nothing left. For example, a storm like a hurricane or a tornado can

devastate part of a city – it can completely elimin ate it. But in this case, it is Anne who will be devastated, meaning she’s going to be very sad and extremely upset. It’s something that’s going to bother her for a lon g time, knowing that her brother- in-law murdered her sister.

A week later, Dr. Reeves and Kathy get together for  dinner, and they talk about what had happened to Sarah Salas. We find out that Bill killed his wife, Sarah, because she had a lot of money and because Bill “ha d a two-million-dollar life insurance policy” on her. A “life insurance policy”  is something you pay for in case someone dies; if that person dies, then the co mpany you bought the life insurance from will pay you the amount of the polic y. Bill had a two-million-dollar life insurance policy on Sarah, plus he would get h alf of the money from the computer company that Anne and Sarah owned.

We also find out that John Costello got involved be cause he was a neighbor of Bill and Sarah’s. He agreed to kidnap Sarah so that  he could get some money as well. But things didn’t work out as planned. John C ostello called Sarah on the phone and asked her for some help on his computer, and “when she got there” – when she arrived there – “John tied her up.” “To ti e someone up” means to take some rope and put it around their arms and their le gs so they can’t move and they can’t leave. He tied Sarah up, and then Bill l eft Los Angeles so that everyone would think that they had both been kidnap ped.

But John Costello “wasn’t a very good helper.” A “h elper” (helper) is, of course, someone who helps. The plan was for John Costello to kill Anne on the freeway, but he didn’t do that, and when he wanted more mone y, Bill decided to kill him, as well. When Dr. Reeves found out that John Costel lo lived in the same apartment building as Bill and Sarah Salas, he “kne w it was no coincidence.” A “coincidence” (coincidence) is when two things that  have a connection to each other happen at the same time. Usually it is just b y chance; it just happens. But Dr. Reeves says he knew that this “was no coinciden ce,” which is how he figured out what happened and solved the mystery.

At the end of the story, Dr. Reeves calls Kathy “a very beautiful woman” – he is still attracted to her, it seems. He and Kathy share some wine, and Kathy “smiled and raised her glass.” “To raise” means to lift up into the air. Dr. Reeves says that he has “forgotten the simple pleasures of life ,” meaning the simple things that make life good. And one of those simple things  is Kathy’s “wonderful smile.” So, perhaps we can expect Darren and Kathy to begin  another romantic relationship.

And so, on this happy note we end the last episode in our series: Missing Person .

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Without thinking for another second, I kicked Bill in his right knee. He screamed in pain and fell backward onto his back. The gun fe ll to the ground. I picked it up and pointed it at Bill.

“The game is over, Bill,” I said, moving the gun cl oser to his face. “I know that you killed John Costello, too. Was he your partner in kidnapping Sarah?”

“Costello was an idiot. He was supposed to kill Ann e and then keep quiet. But he told me he wanted more money or he would tell the p olice everything he knew. So I had to kill him so he wouldn’t blab to the cop s.”

“And you came to Costello’s apartment tonight to ge t rid of any evidence that connected you to him?” I asked.

“Costello had my name written down on a sheet of pa per I gave him. I had to find the paper and get rid of it.” Just then I heard a k nock on the door, and someone came in. It was Kathy Chang.

“Kathy! Right on time!” I said. “Did you call the p olice?”

“Yes, they’re on their way here right now. I have a  cameraperson from the television station outside. We’re ready to report the story.”

The police arrived a few minutes later and arrested  Bill Salas for the murder of his wife and John Costello. Anne would be devastate d, of course, but at least now she would know the truth. Now it was really ove r, and the murderer had been found.

A week later, I met Kathy at her apartment for our usual dinner. Of course, she wanted to know all about the case of Sarah Salas’s kidnapping. We talked over a wonderful meal of baked chicken.

“I understand that Bill killed his wife, Sarah, for  her money,” Kathy said, “but how much money was he going to get?”

 “Bill had a two-million-dollar life insurance polic y on Sarah,” I responded. “Bill would get two million plus half of the money from P rado Computers.”

“And how was John Costello involved in this whole t hing?”

“John Costello lived in the same apartment building  as Bill and Sarah,” I said. “He moved in a few months ago and became friends with B ill. But John liked to go to Las Vegas and gamble. He also liked to smoke and dr ink. So, he needed money – lots of money.”

“And Bill gave him a chance to make a lot of money by helping him kidnap Sarah,” Kathy said.

“Exactly. Bill told John he would give him $500,000  if he helped him kidnap Sarah.”

“But how did they take Sarah? Where did they keep h er?”

“Bill had planned everything out very carefully,” I  explained. “He told John Costello to call Sarah on the phone to ask for some  help with his computer. When she got there, John tied her up and kept her i n his room. Bill left Los Angeles for two days in a rented car so people woul d think that both he and Sarah had disappeared. And it worked: Anne called m e because she thought that both Bill and Sarah were in trouble.”

“What went wrong with Bill’s perfect plan, then?”

“The problem was that John Costello wasn’t a very g ood helper,” I said. “He was supposed to kill Anne on the freeway, but he didn’t . Then he told Bill that if Bill didn’t give him more money, he would tell the polic e about the kidnapping.”

“That’s when Bill decided to kill Costello, to make  sure Costello didn’t tell the police?”

“Exactly. He went to the bar where Costello worked and killed him,” I said. “Then he went back to Costello’s apartment to kill his wi fe. He cut her throat and put her body in the street. But when I discovered that John  Costello lived in the same apartment building, I knew it was no coincidence, a nd that’s how I figured it out.”

I took a drink of wine and looked at Kathy. She rea lly was a very beautiful woman.

 “Well, let’s not think about Anne or Bill or John C ostello,” Kathy said. She smiled and raised her glass of wine. Perhaps I’ve been wor king too hard on this case. I’ve forgotten the simple pleasures of life. It was  time to spend some more time on the good things in life, like a good glass of wi ne, a good meal, and Kathy’s wonderful smile.

# Halloween

ION

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 73 – Halloween.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 73. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Trick-or-treat! Today's podcast is all about Hallow een. Let’s get started.  > As a kid, I always loved Halloween. I liked dressin g up in a costume that I had picked out at the store or, more often, that I had made out of odds and ends at home. The best part was going trick-or-treating. So me years, I went with my brothers and sisters. When I got a little older, I went with my friends.
> We would go to all the houses in our neighborhood a nd knock on the door or ring the doorbell. When the door opened, we would yell, "Trick or treat!" We never played tricks and always got treats. The neighbors would put some candy in our bags, and we would go home at the end of the night and eat to our hearts' content.
> To get ready for Halloween, my parents would buy pu mpkins from the market or from the makeshift pumpkin patches on the side of the road so we could make jack-o’-lanterns. We’d take a pumpkin, cut off the top, scoop out the seeds from the inside, and carve a face on the front. Sometime s we carved a scary face and sometimes we carved funny ones. At night, we would put candles inside the jack- o’-lanterns and put them on our doorstep.
> One year we had a Halloween party. Our friends came  over dressed up as witches, ghosts, superheroes, cartoon characters, a nd anything else you can think of. We played party games like Bobbing for Ap ples, and we even created a haunted house in our backyard. It was a blast! Hall oween is truly a holiday for kids.

Today we are talking about Halloween, which is a ve ry popular tradition or custom here in the United States. It's not an offic ial holiday – it's not like Christmas or New Year's where you don't have to go to work – but it is very widely celebrated in the U.S. The name “Halloween” is a combination of two

words: “hallow” (hallow) and “een” (een). “Hallow” is an old word for “holy,” and “een” is an old English word that means “eve” (eve) . The “eve” of something is the night before something.

In the Catholic Church, November 1st is called “All  Saints Day,” or sometimes “All Hallows Day.” So, the night before All Hallows  Day is All Hallows Eve, which ended up being shortened to simply “Halloween.” “Ha lloween,” then, always falls on, or takes place on, the 31st of October. Hallowe en is a very old holiday that began early in European history – some people think  even before the days of the Romans. At the time, people would have celebrations  associated with the dead.

Originally, the idea was that for one night, the de ad would come back to life and would go around looking for food. So, people would leave food outside their houses as gifts for the dead people. People would w ear masks over their faces to disguise themselves. A “mask” is something you wear  over your face so that people can't recognize you. The verb “to disguise” (disguise) means to change your appearance so people don't know who you are. B ut nowadays, at least in the United States, Halloween is a holiday for child ren to dress up in costumes and walk from house to house, getting candy from th eir neighbors.

In the story, I say that “when I was a kid, I liked  dressing up in a costume that I had picked out at the store.” “To dress up” is a tw o-word phrasal verb that usually means to wear your nicest clothing. “I'm going to d ress up for the wedding this Saturday. I'm going to wear a suit and a tie.” But “to dress up” can also mean to put on a costume. A “costume” (costume) is clothing  that makes you look like a different person. So, you would get a police office r costume if you wanted to dress up as a police officer.

We often made costumes out of “odds and ends.” “Odd s and ends” are just various things you have in your house: paper bags, material, string, whatever you happen to have. In my family, we would often make o ur costumes from odds and ends, from whatever it is that was in the house at that time. Nowadays, people go out and buy costumes. Sometimes, they can be very e xpensive. There are also stores that will rent costumes to you just for that  day.

In the story, I say that the best part of Halloween  was “going trick or treating.” “Trick (trick) or treat” (treat) is what children s ay, or yell, when the neighbor opens the door. The children walk up to the door, they knock on the door, and they yell, “Trick-or-treat.” What they are really s aying is that either they will play a trick on the neighbor or they will get a treat.

A “trick” here means something naughty, something s lightly bad that you would do to someone. We have the expression “to play a tr ick on someone,” which means to deceive or fool someone. A “treat” is a sm all surprise gift – often food, and in this case, candy. So, the neighbors are supp osed to give the children a treat if they don't want the children to play a tri ck on them. We call this tradition “trick or treating.”

There is another story about the history of why we say, “Trick or treat,” which is that children used to have to do something entertai ning in order to get a treat. In this case, a trick could mean a song, a game, or so mething involved with magic. But in any case, at least nowadays in the United St ates, kids do not perform tricks. Instead, they knock on the door and they ex pect to get candy. So, if you live in an area, in a neighborhood, with children a s I do, you have to go out and buy some candy to give to the children who come tri ck-or-treating or you will be a very unpopular neighbor.

After trick-or-treating, I say that we would go hom e with our candy and “eat to our hearts’ content.” “To do something to your hearts’ content” (content) means to do something for as long as you want to do it, to do s omething until you are satisfied. So, “to eat to your hearts’ content” mea ns to eat as much as you want with no restrictions, not stopping for any reason.

I said that before Halloween, “My parents would buy  pumpkins from the market or from the makeshift pumpkin patches on the side of the road.” A “pumpkin” (pumpkin) is a round orange vegetable that is very important for the celebration of Halloween. You can get a pumpkin either from the  grocery store – from the market – or from what is called a “pumpkin patch” ( patch). A “pumpkin patch” is basically a field where they have pumpkins for sale , often where the pumpkins themselves are grown.

The word “makeshift” (makeshift) is an adjective me aning something that is temporary. A “makeshift pumpkin patch” is something  that they put together just for Halloween, and then when Halloween is over, the y take it apart. This happens a lot during holidays. You will see temporary or ma keshift places where you can buy Christmas trees during the Christmas season. for Halloween, you can buy pumpkins. Even in the city you will find these make shift areas, usually on an empty parking lot where people sell things that are  for that particular holiday.

My parents bought pumpkins so that we could make ja ck-o’-lanterns. “Making jack-o’-lanterns,” also called “carving a pumpkin,”  is another Halloween tradition. You carefully cut the top off of the pumpkin and th en you scoop out the seeds from the inside. “To scoop (scoop) out” means to sc rape out or to remove.

 When carving a pumpkin, you first need to scoop out  the seeds that are inside the pumpkin. After you've done that, you then carve  a face on your pumpkin. “To carve” (carve) means to cut something very carefull y or precisely. So, you carefully take a knife and you carve a face on your  pumpkin. You make holes for the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and so forth. You ca n make a happy, smiling face or a mean, scary face.

The carved pumpkin is usually called a “jack-o’-lan tern” (jack-o’-lantern). A “lantern” is something like a lamp – when you put a  candle inside a carved pumpkin, the light shines out through the holes of the face like a light or a lantern. You then put your “jack-o'-lantern” on your doorste p. A “doorstep” (doorstep) is the step or area in front of your house near the fr ont door. The door of the house is often above the level of the ground, so you have  to have stairs, or steps, in order to get up to the door.

I said that “one year, we had a Halloween party,” m eaning the Halloween party was at our house. A “Halloween party” is often a co stume party in which everyone dresses up in a costume. At our party, peo ple came dressed up as witches, ghosts, superheroes, and cartoon character s. A “witch” (witch) is a woman who is said to have a magical powers. A man w ho has magical powers is called a “warlock” (warlock). A “ghost” (ghost) is the spirit of someone who has died. A “superhero” is someone like Batman or Super man. And “cartoon characters” are characters like Bugs Bunny and Mick ey Mouse. On Halloween, you can dress up as all sorts of things or people.

At our Halloween party, we played party games like “Bobbing for Apples.” “Bobbing (bobbing) for Apples” is a traditional gam e at many American Halloween parties. To play, you fill a large contai ner, such as a bucket, full of water, and you put apples in the water. The players  in the game then have to get the apples out of the water without using their han ds. So, you would put your head in the water and try to remove an apple by bit ing with your teeth, which is harder to do than it sounds. That's called “Bobbing  for Apples.”

I said that we even made a “haunted house” in our b ackyard. Something that is “haunted” (haunted) is something that is thought to  be influenced by, or affected by, some sort of spiritual or magical presence. A “ haunted house” is a house that is supposed to have spirits or ghosts living in it.  Creating a haunted house is another tradition associated with Halloween. We had  a haunted house in our backyard, which is the area behind your house.

Finally, I said that our Halloween party was a blas t. “It was a blast” (blast) is an informal expression meaning it was a lot of fun.

Now let’s listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed. > As a kid, I always loved Halloween. I liked dressin g up in a costume that I had picked out at the store or, more often, that I had made out of odds and ends at home. The best part was going trick-or-treating.

# Reserving a Rental Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 74 – Reserving a Rental Car.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 74. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about making a reservation for a re ntal car. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I will be in Chicago next week and need a rental ca r. I called up Bargain Rental Car and made a reservation. After I got through the  phone tree, I spoke with a reservation agent.

Agent: Welcome to Bargain Rental Car.

Jeff: I'd like to reserve a rental car.

Agent: What city will you be picking up from?

Jeff: Chicago.

Agent: Which airport location? O’Hare or Midway?

Jeff: Hmm. I'm not sure. Is there a downtown locati on?

Agent: Sure. We have an office at 401 State Street.

Jeff: Is that near Prairie State College?

Agent: I really don't know.

Jeff: That's okay. I'll go ahead and make a reserva tion for that location.

Agent: For what date and time?

Jeff: For November 11 th , around 7 p.m.

Agent: Returning to the same location?

 Jeff: No. I’d like to drop it off at the Chicago O’ Hare airport.

Agent: Okay. On what date and time?

Jeff: It'll be that Sunday, November 13 th , around the same time.

Agent: What size car would you like? A compact, mid -size, or full-size?

Jeff: I’d like the most economical.

Agent: That would be the compact. The rental fee wo uld be $32.25 a day, giving you a grand total of $62.50 for the two days.

Jeff: Does that include taxes and fees?

Agent: No. With all applicable taxes and fees, you grand total comes to $77.40.

Jeff: Okay, that's fine.

Jeff: I'll be using a MasterCard.

Agent: Okay, I have a compact reserved for pickup a t our downtown location on November 11 th  at 7 p.m., returning November 13 th  at 7 p.m. at Chicago O’Hare. Is there another reservation I can help you with?

Jeff: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Have a good afternoon and thank you for calling Bargain Rental Car.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with me saying, “I will be in C hicago next week and need a rental car.” Chicago is located in the central part  of the United States, in the state of Illinois. “I called up Bargain Rental Cars and m ade a reservation.” “Bargain Rental Cars” is just a made-up name, not a real com pany that rents cars. A “bargain” is a good deal, a low price. I called up this rental car company and made a “reservation.” A “reservation” is when you make some arrangement to use a service or perhaps to use a physical object f or a certain amount of time. Here, I'm reserving a car. I want to use a car when  I am in Chicago. “After I got through the phone tree, I spoke with a reservation agent.”

The term “phone tree” refers to a system of announc ements that you hear when you are trying to get a hold of someone, when you a re trying to contact someone, in a large company. A lot of companies, when you ca ll the phone number for the company, do not have a live human being answering the phone. Instead, you hear a message. Typically, the message will say som ething like, “If you'd like information on this topic, press 1. If you'd like i nformation on this topic, press 2,” and then you have to keep pressing different number s or saying different numbers until you get to the information or the per son you want. That's a phone tree.

I say, “After I got through the phone tree” – after  I found the right option – “I spoke with a reservation agent.” An “agent” (agent)  is a person who works for a company, who is responsible for talking to customer s. The president of the company doesn't have time to talk to every customer , so they hire people to work for the company, called “agents,” who talk directly  to the customer when the customer has questions. You can have a “customer se rvice agent” – that's a person who deals with the customers and gives them service, gives them help. Some companies call them by a special name.

Here, we use the term “reservation agent” – that wo uld be the person who is going to help me make a reservation. The agent answ ers the phone, “Welcome to Bargain Rental Car.” That's a very formal way th at a company might use to answer the phone. I say, “I'd like to reserve a ren tal car.” The agent then asked me, “What city will you be picking up from?” “To pi ck something up” from somewhere is to go to a particular location in orde r to get something. Here, she's asking where I will pick up the car, where I will g et the car. I may pick up at one

location and drop off at a different location. We’l l talk about dropping off in a minute.

“Picking up a car” means getting the car the first day so that you can drive it and use it. I tell her that I'll be picking it up in Ch icago. She then asked, “Which airport location?” She's asking which place I want to pick it up, since in many big cities there is more than one airport. The Los Angeles are a, for example, has at least three large airports and several small airports. the agent asks if I want to pick up the car at “O'Hare” or “Midway.” Those are the name s of two large airports in the Chicago area. I say, “I'm not sure. Is there a down town location?” Now I'm asking if I can pick up my car not at the airport, but som ewhere in the central part of the city.

The agent says, “Sure, we have an office at 401 Sta te Street” – that's the place where I could go and pick up a car downtown. I then  asked the agent, “Is that near Prairie State College?” I'm asking if the place where I can pick up the car is near to the place where I want to go, which in this  dialogue is a made-up college by the name of “Prairie State College.” That's not a real college. The agent doesn't know if Prairie State College is near the d owntown location. I say, “That's okay. I'll go ahead and make a reservation for that  location.” “I'll go ahead” means I will continue on. I want to make the reserv ation.

The agent asked for what date and time. I say, “For  November 11 th , around 7 p.m.” – seven o'clock in the evening. Then the agen t asked me, “Returning to the same location?” That means, “Are you going to bring  the car back” – are you going to return the car – “to the same place where you picked it up?” I say, “No. I'd like to drop it off at the Chicago O'Hare airpo rt.” “To drop something off” is the opposite of “to pick something up.” It's to leave it when you are finished using it – in this case, giving the car back to the rental car  company. The agent asks, “Okay, on what date and time?” I say, “It'll be tha t Sunday, November 13 th , around the same time” – approximately at the same t ime.

The agent says, “What size would you like? A compac t, mid-size, or full-size?” There are three basic sizes you can rent a car in. The smallest size is called a “compact” (compact). Usually, a compact car is very  small and often has only two doors. A regular car that has four doors and is lar ger would be called a “full-size car.” In between a full-size car and a compact car is a “mid- (mid-) size car.” A mid-size car is not small but not large – somewhere  in between. Usually, mid- sized cars do have four doors.

I say, “I'd like the most economical.” When we talk  about something being “economical,” we mean it's not expensive. It's chea p. It doesn't cost a lot of

money. I want the cheapest car I can rent, which is  what I always do in real life when I rent a car. I always rent the cheapest car I  can find. The agent says, “That would be the compact,” meaning if you want the chea pest car, you want to rent the compact car. Then she tells me that “The rental  fee would be $32.25 a day, giving you a grand total of $62.50 for the two days .”

The “rental fee” (fee) is the price of the car. The  agent is giving me the price of the car for each day. She says it “would be” – it w ill be – “$32.25 a day.” She doesn't use the words “dollar” and “cents.” She jus t says “$32.25.” When you're talking about prices, the person will understand fr om the context, from the conversation, what that means. It doesn't mean $3,2 25 dollars a day, although it could. It means $32.25. The agent then says that the total would be $62.50 – 62 dollars and 50 cents for the two days.

I say, “Does that include taxes and fees?” In most places, when you rent a car, you have to pay taxes. You have to pay the governme nt some additional money. Also, sometimes when they give you the price of the  rental car, there are additional costs, additional fees that they don't i nclude in the daily fee that they tell you. In other words, something that would not be included in the $32.25 a day. You have to be very careful to make sure that the price you are getting when you rent a car in the United States includes the taxes and fees – all the additional costs.

Of course, the gas is not included. You have to pay  for your own gas. And usually when you rent a car in the United States, y ou have to fill the gas tank up again before you return it. If you don't, they will  charge you for the gas that they have to put in the car so that the next person can use it. The agent says, “No,” meaning no, it doesn't include taxes and fees.

She then says, “With all applicable taxes and fees,  your grand total comes to $77.40.” “Applicable” (applicable) means relevant –  connected to what we are talking about. “All applicable taxes” would be all the taxes that would apply to or be relevant to this transaction, this rental. It's not really a necessary term. Of course the company is not going to charge you taxes  for things that are not applicable, but it's one of those terms that has be en adopted by a lot of businesses nowadays. They use that term. The agent says the “grand total” comes to $77.40. The “grand (grand) total” is the f inal total after all the expenses are added together.

Sometimes, the company that you are purchasing some thing from will give you a total that just includes certain costs and then the y say, “Well, adding the taxes and the other things, the grand total is . . .” wha tever it is. The term “grand total”

 is also used, many times, when you are buying more than one thing. You may be buying several different items from a store. The pe rson who is giving you the prices may give you the individual prices for each thing you buy and then at the end say, “The grand total is . . .” – and that woul d include all of the things that you are buying.

I say, “Okay that's fine” – that's okay. She then a sks for my last name and I spell it for her. She says, “And your first name?” I say,  “Jeff.” The agent doesn't understand me, so she says “J-E-S-S?” She thinks my  name is Jess, and I say, “No, J-E-F, as in Frank, F.” Like many languages, E nglish has certain words that we use when we are trying to communicate the letter  that might be difficult for the other person to hear or to distinguish. Different c ountries, I'm guessing, in English have different words that they use.

There isn't one official set of words that everyone  who speaks English uses. People will often use the names of common objects o r of people. So, I use the name “Frank.” “F, as in Frank” means if you think of the word “Frank,” the first letter is “F” – that that's the letter I'm talking about. It's always the first letter that you use. So, you might say, “B, as in Boy.” The wor d “boy” begins with a “B,” and that's how you know that I'm saying “B” and not “D”  or “G.”

Again, it's hard to give you a list of these words.  In some languages, there is an established list that everyone uses, but not in Eng lish. I actually use the list that is used internationally by radio operators and mili tary people. Some people know this list, but it's used mostly by government offic ials and military officials. The words in alphabetical order from A-Z are “Alpha,” “ Bravo,” “Charlie,” “Delta,” “Echo,” “Foxtrot,” “Golf,” “Hotel,” “India,” “Julie t,” “Kilo,” “Lima,” “Mike,” “November,” “Oscar,” “Papa,” “Quebec,” “Romeo,” “Si erra,” “Tango,” “Uniform,” “Victor,” “Whiskey,” “X-ray,” “Yankee,” and “Zulu.”  Now you know.

The dialogue ends with the agent asking me what cre dit card I want to use. I say, “I’ll be using a MasterCard.” “MasterCard,” “Visa,”  and “American Express” are the three most popular credit cards in the United S tates. The agent then repeats the information about my reservation and asks me if  there is another reservation she can help me with. I say, “No. That's all. Thank s.” That's all means I'm done. I don’t have anything else to get from you or ask of you.

The agent then says, “It's my pleasure.” That's a very formal way to say, “You're welcome.” “It's my pleasure. Have a good afternoon and thank you for calling Bargain Rental Car.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

I will be in Chicago next week and need a rental ca r. I called up Bargain Rental Cars and made a reservation. After I got through the phone tree, I spoke with a reservation agent.

Agent: Welcome to Bargain Rental Car.

Jeff: I'd like to reserve a rental car.

Agent: What city will you be picking up from?

Jeff: Chicago.

Agent: Which airport location? O’Hare or Midway?

Jeff: Hmm. I'm not sure. Is there a downtown locati on?

Agent: Sure. We have an office at 401 State Street.

Jeff: Is that near Prairie State College?

Agent: I really don't know.

Jeff: That's okay. I'll go ahead and make a reserva tion for that location.

Agent: For what date and time?

Jeff: For November 11, around 7 p.m.

Agent: Returning to the same location?

Jeff: No. I’d like to drop it off at the Chicago O’ Hare airport.

Agent: Okay. On what date and time?

Jeff: It'll be that Sunday, November 13, around the  same time.

Agent: What size car would you like? A compact, mid -size, or full-size?

Jeff: I’d like the most economical.

 Agent: That would be the compact. The rental fee wo uld be $32.25 a day, giving you a grand total of $62.50 for the two days.

Jeff: Does that include taxes and fees?

Agent: No. With all applicable taxes and fees, you grand total comes to $77.40.

Jeff: Okay, that's fine.

Agent: Your last name?

Jeff: McQuillan. M-C-Q-U-I-L-L-A-N.

Agent: And your first name?

Jeff: Jeff.

Agent: J-E-S-S?

Jeff: No, J-E-F, as in Frank, F.

Agent: What credit card will you be using?

Jeff: I'll be using a MasterCard.

Agent: Okay, I have a compact reserved for pickup a t our downtown location on November 11 at 7 p.m., returning November 13 at 7 p .m. at Chicago O’Hare. Is there another reservation I can help you with?

Jeff: No, that's all. Thanks.

Agent: It's my pleasure. Have a good afternoon and thank you for calling Bargain Rental Car.

Today’s podcast is going to be about getting childc are, or getting someone to take care of your children. Let’s go! > My friend Susan is an engineer, and she's also a si ngle mom. She has been working some odd hours lately and was having a toug h time finding childcare for her four-year-old daughter and her eight-year-old s on.
> Her daughter, Kimberly, is enrolled in a preschool,  and Susan is able to drop her off on her way to work. But the preschool closes at  6:00 p.m., and sometimes Susan can't get there in time to pick her up.
> Her son, Paul, is in the second grade and goes to a  public school near their house. Paul gets out of school at 3:00 p.m., but Su san never gets off work before 6:00 p.m., and sometimes later.
> So, what can she do with the kids after school? I w ent with Susan to check out a latchkey program at the local community center. It seemed like a good idea. Paul would be picked up from his school, and he could st ay at the center to do his homework and to play in the center until as late as  7:00 p.m. The tuition was fairly low and there was rolling admission. The tro uble was, there was very little supervision of the kids, and the staff seemed inexp erienced.
> Now, Susan is considering hiring a nanny. The nanny  would pick both kids up from their schools and bring them home. The nanny c ould make dinner for them and stay with them until she got home. This would b e ideal, but a good nanny is hard to come by and is very expensive to hire, even  the ones who don't live in.
> I don't envy Susan. Single moms – and dads – have it tough.
> In this episode, we’re talking about “childcare” (c hildcare), which is when you have someone look after or take care of your childr en while you are working. I talk about my friend Susan, who is an engineer and a single mom. A “mom” is a mother, and a “single mom” is a mother who isn’t ma rried. She could never have been married, or she could have divorced, or her hu sband could have died. In any event, she is on her own. She is a “single mom. ”

This friend of mine “has been working some odd hour s.” “To work odd (odd) hours” means to not work during the usual working h ours, normally eight or nine o’clock in the morning until five o’clock in the af ternoon – those would be normal hours, or business hours. “Odd hours” would be if y ou had to work, for example, from ten o’clock at night until six o’clock in the morning. That might be considered working “odd hours.” Another use of that expression  is when you do not have a regular schedule. For example, some days you work f rom eight o’clock in the morning until three o’clock in the afternoon, other  days from noon until eight o’clock at night, and so forth.

I say that Susan “was having a tough time finding c hildcare.” “Tough” here means difficult – Susan was having a difficult time  finding childcare for her two children. “Her daughter, Kimberly, is enrolled in a  preschool.” A “preschool” (preschool) – all one word – is what we call a scho ol for young children especially between the ages of three to five. Sometimes presch ools go a little younger than that, but normally it is for ages three to five. He re in the U.S., children go to preschool, and then when they finish preschool –usu ally around age five – they go into kindergarten, and after kindergarten they g o into grade school: first grade, second grade, and so forth.

Preschool is optional; children don’t have to go to  preschool. There are some people who like to keep their children at home beca use they can stay home to watch them, or who prefer to put them in some other  program. Susan’s daughter, Kimberly, goes to a preschool, and Susan “is able to drop her off on her way to work.” “To drop off” means to leave someone or some thing at a certain place. “On her way to work” means somewhere between her ho use and her work. She can drop off her daughter at this preschool, which is located on her way to work.

“But the preschool closes at 6:00 p.m., and sometim es Susan can't get there in time to pick her up.” “In time” means before some d eadline, before it is too late. “Did you get there in time?” means “Did you get the re before it was too late?” So,

for example, if a movie starts at 7:00 p.m., and yo u get there at 7:05 p.m., you didn’t get there in time. The movie already started .

Susan’s son, Paul, “is in the second grade and goes  to a public school near their house.” In the United States, a “public school” is a school that the government operates, that the government runs. The opposite of  a “public school” would be a “private school.” This is different than in British  English.In Britain, the term “public school” means “private school,” so it can be very c onfusing. But in the United States, a “public school” or a “public” anything is  usually something that the government operates. And in the United States, each  school system is governed, or run, by a local school board – a group of people  who are elected to run the school system in their area.

“Susan never gets off work before 6:00 p.m.” “To ge t off work” means to be finished with work. “I get off work at five” means I am done working at five. Susan and I went “to check out” or to investigate – “a la tchkey program at the local community center.” A “latchkey (latchkey) program” is a program in which school- age kids can go to a special place after school and  there’s someone there to take care of them until the parents come and pick them u p, usually after five or six o’clock in the afternoon. This is called a “latchke y program.”

A “key” is what you open a door with, and the word “latchkey” refers to the key to the front or main door of a house. Here in the Unit ed States, the school day is usually over at around three o’clock in the afterno on, sometimes a little later, and many working parents don’t have a place for their c hildren to go after school. So, for that hour or two hours before the parent can ge t home from work, a lot of children are on their own, and they have to use the ir key – their “latchkey” – to get into their house. Kids who do this are sometime s referred to as “latchkey kids.”

A “latchkey program” is a program where these kids can come together in one place where there are adults to take care of them. One place that may have a “latchkey program” is a “community center.” A “comm unity center” is usually a government building in a neighborhood, or a section  of a city, that different organizations can use for various things. Usually there will be a big room like an auditorium for concerts or plays. Community centers  will often offer classes that are free or inexpensive. Many cities have a communi ty center, operated by the city government.

I say, “the tuition was fairly low” at the latchkey  program. “Tuition” is money you pay to go to a school. We often talk about tuition being “low” or “high.” “Low tuition” is not very expensive; “high tuition,” how ever, is expensive. I say this

latchkey program has “rolling admission.” “Rolling admission” is when there isn’t a deadline for applying or signing up to get into s omething. You can join the program at any point during the year.

But the problem with this program was that “there w as very little supervision of the kids, and the staff seemed inexperienced.” “Sup ervision” is the act of looking after or taking care of someone or something. The v erb is “to supervise,” and a person who supervises is called a “supervisor.” At this latchkey program, “there was very little supervision of the kids,” meaning the kids weren’t being watched very well. Also, “the staff seemed inexperienced.” Someone who is “experienced” has been doing something for a long time and has “e xperience” doing it. “Inexperienced” is the opposite of “experienced” – someone who is “inexperienced” has not been doing something for a long time.

Susan is now considering “hiring a nanny.” A “nanny ” (nanny) – what the French might call an “au pair” – is a person, often a youn g woman, who comes to a house and takes care of the children while the pare nts aren’t there. Often, a nanny cleans the house and makes meals for the fami ly. Sometimes nannies are “live- (live) in (in),” meaning they sleep and stay  with the family full-time. There are also nannies who will just come during the day and leave at night. I say that a good nanny “is hard to come by.” When we say someth ing is “hard to come by,” we mean it’s difficult to get. For example, “It’s h ard to come by really good movies nowadays.” Well, I think so.

I say that, “I don’t envy Susan.” “Envy” (envy) is similar to “jealousy.” When someone has something that you want, you “envy” the m for having that thing. I say that “I don’t envy Susan,” because she has a di fficult situation – it is not a situation that I would want. I end by saying, “Sing le moms – and dads – have it tough.” “To have it tough” means to be in a difficu lt situation or circumstance – to have things harder than some.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

My friend Susan is an engineer, and she's also a si ngle mom. She has been working some odd hours lately and was having a toug h time finding childcare for her four-year-old daughter and her eight-year-old s on.

Her daughter, Kimberly, is enrolled in a preschool,  and Susan is able to drop her off on her way to work. But the preschool closes at  6:00 p.m., and sometimes Susan can't get there in time to pick her up.

 Her son, Paul, is in the second grade and goes to a  public school near their house. Paul gets out of school at 3:00 p.m., but Su san never gets off work before 6:00 p.m., and sometimes later.

So, what can she do with the kids after school? I w ent with Susan to check out a latchkey program at the local community center. It seemed like a good idea. Paul would be picked up from his school, and he could st ay at the center to do his homework and to play in the center until as late as  7:00 p.m. The tuition was fairly low and there was rolling admission. The tro uble was, there was very little supervision of the kids, and the staff seemed inexp erienced.

Now, Susan is considering hiring a nanny. The nanny  would pick both kids up from their schools and bring them home. The nanny c ould make dinner for them and stay with them until she got home. This would b e ideal, but a good nanny is hard to come by and is very expensive to hire, even  the ones who don't live in.

I don't envy Susan. Single moms – and dads – have it tough.

# Asking for and Giving Instructions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 76 – Asking for and Giving Instructions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 76. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to discuss asking for and giving instructions. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

My supervisor at work asked me the other day to hel p out one of the new employees. She needs some basic orientation on how to log in to our network. So I made an appointment with her to come to my cub icle for a little training session.

Jeff: Hi, Lucy. How are you settling in?

Lucy: Just fine, thanks. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out with this software. May I ask you what we will be covering to day?

Jeff: Sure. Before I do that, could you tell me if you've worked with this program before? That will help me figure out how to proceed .

Lucy: I've done a little work with it, but not much .

Jeff: Well, it's a good idea to have the manual rea dy, since it can get a bit hairy. You should start by logging in with your username a nd password.

Lucy: How do I do that?

Jeff: You can just click on the button in the corne r. Be sure to enter the password you created. You can write it down until you memori ze it, but you might want to keep it in a safe place.

Lucy: Okay. Then what?

Jeff: Well, then just select the network you want to work with, and you're all set.

Lucy: Great, thanks for your help, Jeff. May I trou ble you to show me how to print reports out from the program?

Jeff: Sure. I'll do what I can to help.

[end of dialogue]

In this episode, we are talking about how to ask for instructions – how to ask other people to explain to you how to do something.  In this particular example, my supervisor at work asked me to “help out one of the new employees.” “To help out” means the same as “to help.” “I'm going to help her out” means “I'm going to help her.” It's another one of those many examples of a two-word verb in English, in which the second word – a preposition –  gives some additional emphasis. In the case of “to help out,” the preposi tion “out” stresses, or emphasizes, the fact that we are really going to be  helping the person.

The employee at my work “needs some basic orientati on on how to log in to our network.” An “orientation” (orientation) is when yo u give someone an overview, or a general idea, about what to do. Usually, when a p erson joins a new organization, a new company, or a new school, we gi ve them some orientation, meaning we give them some direction, some informati on. We let them know how the company or school is organized, where the most important offices and people are, and so forth.

“To log in” means to enter information that allows you to be a member of or to use a particular computer system software or someth ing similar. You might “log in” to a website. A “network” (network) is a system  of connected computers in a company or organization. I asked Lucy, the new empl oyee, “to come to my cubicle.” A “cubicle” (cubicle) is a small work spa ce with short walls that don't go up to the ceiling and no door. In a big office, the re could be many cubicles. They are like little offices divided by small walls, but  they're not really offices because they're not separate rooms.

I ask Lucy how she is settling in. When we ask some one, “How are you settling in?” we mean, “How are you getting used to” – or ge tting accustomed to – “your new situation?” You can “settle in” at a new school , a new house, or a new job. It just means that you are becoming familiar with thin gs and adjusting, or adapting, to your new situation. Lucy says she is settling in  “just fine.”

Then she says, “I appreciate you taking the time to  help me out.” The expression “I appreciate you” plus the “-ing” or gerund form of a verb is a very common way of thanking someone. For example, “I appreciate you  listening to our podcast” or

“I appreciate my friend taking me to the airport.” You can also appreciate someone for not doing something. “I appreciate you not punching me in the nose,” for example.

Lucy then asks, “May I ask you what we will be cove ring today?” This is another polite way of asking someone for something, a polit e way of introducing a question. “May I ask you where the bathroom is?” or  “May I ask you what we will be doing today?” Notice that the expression “May I ask you” is then followed by another question. It’s what we sometimes call an “e mbedded question,” which has a different subject-verb order than a regular q uestion.

For example, in the question “What will we be cover ing, or going over, today?” the question word “what” comes first, the auxiliary  verb “will” comes second, and the pronoun “we” comes third. That's a normal quest ion. But in an embedded question, or question within a question, we reverse  the order of the verb and the pronoun so that “what will we” becomes “what we wil l,” as in, “May I ask you what we will be covering?” If you don't say “May I ask y ou,” then it's just a regular question: “What will we be covering?”

After Lucy asks me what we will be covering, I say,  “Before I do that, could you tell me if you've worked with this program before?”  “Could you tell me” is another polite way of asking someone a question. “Could you  tell me if the movie starts at seven or at eight?” That's another way of asking, “ Does the movie starts at seven or at eight?” But beginning with “Could you tell me ” is a more formal, more polite way of asking. I tell Lucy that knowing whether she  has worked with the program before will help me figure out or help me understan d how to proceed. “To proceed” (proceed) means to go forward, to move for ward, to keep going.

I tell Lucy, “It's a good idea to have the manual r eady, since it can get a bit hairy.” The expression “it's a good idea” is a polite way of saying, “You should do this.” “It's a good idea to arrive early for your intervie w” means “You should arrive early for your interview.” It's a little more indirect an d polite way of suggesting something to someone. The word “hairy” (hairy) here  doesn't mean actual hair. Although you could describe someone with a lot of h air on his body as being “hairy.” Monkeys and bears are hairy. But here the word “hairy” just means difficult. “This could get hairy” means this situat ion could become difficult.

I tell Lucy, “You should start by logging in with y our username and password.” “You should” is a very direct way of telling someon e to do something. “You should tell me where the money is.” It's not very p olite, but it's very common, particularly among people who know each other well or between a boss and her employee. I also tell Lucy, “Be sure to enter the p assword you created.” “Be sure

to” is another way of politely but directly remindi ng someone to do something. “Be sure to turn the light off” means remember to t urn the light off.

I tell Lucy that she might want to keep her passwor d in a safe place. The expression “You might want to” is similar to “it's a good idea to.” “You might want to turn your computer off at the end of the day.” I t's a polite way of telling someone what you think the other person should do, that still has the form of a suggestion. So, you're not saying, “You must do thi s,” but you're saying, “Well, you might want to do this” – it's a good idea. We u se those two expressions interchangeably, one for the other. “You may want t o”; “you might want to.” There's really not much of a difference in meaning in normal conversation.

Finally, Lucy asks “May I trouble you to show me ho w to print reports out from the program.” “May I trouble (trouble) you” is anot her polite, formal way of asking someone for something. If you were talking to a str anger, someone you didn't know, you might ask, “May I trouble you to tell me where the bathroom is?” Notice that was another example of a question withi n a question, what we call an “embedded question.” And so, the second question ha s the subject and verb in reverse order.

The subject comes first, and then the verb: “where the bathroom is.” If it were just a regular question, if you will, we would say, “Whe re is the bathroom?” But to be more polite, we would say, “May I trouble you to te ll me where the bathroom is?” This is a very formal way of asking a favor of some one. If you know someone very well, it's probably too formal. It might seem a little strange that you're using this way of asking for information or for asking a question. However, if you are in a formal situation or if you don't know someone, th en it is perfectly okay.

Lucy asks about printing out something. “To print o ut” is another two-word phrasal verb where the preposition doesn't really a dd much to the meaning other than emphasis. “To print out” just means to print. “I'm going to print out my report” means I'm going to print my report with the printer . But again, we often add an extra word – in this case, the preposition “out.”

There is a noun “printout” which is one word, that refers to the actual paper copy of what you print out from a computer. It could be computer information, it could be financial information, it could be a receipt, an d so forth. So, “printout” functions both as a noun (as one word) and as a verb (as two words). I also tell Lucy to write down her password until she memorizes it. “Wr ite down” is another two- word phrasal verb that really just means to write. I also tell Lucy to keep her password in a safe place, a place where no one will  steal it.

Finally, I explain to her how to select, or choose,  the network she wants to work with. I say after you do that, “you're all set” (se t). The expression “all set” means completely ready – ready to go. If you're leaving o n a big trip, you have to prepare your luggage, prepare your bags. When you'r e finished, you can say, “Okay, I'm all set” – I'm ready to go.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

My supervisor at work asked me the other day to hel p out one of the new employees. She needs some basic orientation on how to log in to our network. So I made an appointment with her to come to my cub icle for a little training session.

Jeff: Hi, Lucy. How are you settling in?

# Shopping at the Mall

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 77 – At the Shopping Mall.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 77. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to go shopping at the mall. Let’s get started.  > I needed a new pair of pants for a wedding I was at tending next week, so I went to the mall during my lunch hour. The mall had a bi g variety of stores, including two department stores, so I was sure to find someth ing that was just right. I found a space in the parking structure and entered the ma ll through the main entrance. This was right next to the food court.
> Okay, where to start?
> I headed to one of the two department stores. On the way there, though, I saw a nice pair of pants in a window display of a men’s c lothing store. I decided to go in. As I walked in, I saw a sales clerk hanging som e shirts on a rack.
> She said, “Hi, can I help you find something?”
> “Oh, I’m just browsing,” I said.
> “Okay. Let me know if you need any help.” I told he r thanks, and started looking around the store. There were some nice sweaters fol ded on the shelves and some dress pants on the racks. I made my way toward  the back of the store and found the same pair of pants I saw in the window di splay. And, they were on sale! They were 50 percent off. I started looking f or my size. There were plenty of smalls and larges, but no mediums.
> The sales clerk was walking by just then so I asked  her, “Do you have any other sizes in the back?” But, I was out of luck. This wa s all they had. “But,” she said, “I have another pair of pants in a medium and they’ve been marked down, too. Would you like to try them on?”
> Our story begins with me explaining that “I needed a new pair of pants for a wedding I was attending” – or going to – “next week , so I went to the mall during my lunch hour.” A “mall” (mall) is a large shopping  structure, a large building that contains many different stores. The mall I went to had a large or “big variety of stores,” meaning it had many different kinds of sto res.

The mall had two department stores. A “department s tore” is a large store that sells many different kinds of items, which are typi cally organized into sections or departments. “Department stores” might sell clothin g. They might sell bicycles. They might sell dishwashers. Department stores in the U.S. sell lots of different kinds of things. I knew that this mall had two depa rtment stores, “so I was sure to find something that was just right,” meaning that w as perfect for me.

I found a “space,” meaning a space for my car, “in the parking structure.” A “parking structure” is basically a parking garage t hat usually has more than one level. It could have two stories. It could have fiv e stories. In some of the bigger malls in the U.S., there are seven or eight levels to the parking. That's called a “parking structure.” If there's just one level of p arking and it’s outside, we would call that a “parking lot.” So, I went to the parkin g structure and found a space.

I “entered the mall through the main entrance.” The  “main entrance” would typically be the place where most people enter into , in this case, the mall. I say, “This was right next to the food court.” In America n malls, there’s often a “food

court” (court) which is basically an area for small  restaurants to serve food. Usually, there are a set of tables and chairs in the middle of an area, and the small restaurants – typically, seven or ten restaur ants – are there selling food, and you can buy food from many of the restaurants a nd then sit down at one of the tables.

I say that “I headed to one of the two department s tores.” “To head to” means to go in the direction of. “On the way there” – as I w as walking to the department store – “I saw a nice pair of pants in a window dis play of a men's clothing store.” A “window display” (display) is an area that has a large piece of glass in front of it where stores put things that they are selling so pe ople can see them as they walk by. You could have a window display in a store that  was right on the street, or you could have a window display, as in this case, i n a store inside a mall. “I decided to go in,” meaning I decided to walk into t his men's clothing store.

“As I walked in” – while I was walking in – “I saw a sales clerk hanging some shirts on a rack.” A “sales clerk” (clerk) is an em ployee at a store who helps people find what they need and pay for the things they want to buy. A “rack” (rack) here means a section of bars or poles where clothing is hung or put in a store. If you have a dress shirt, or possibly a dre ss for a woman, you’d probably want to put it on a rack. You’re not going to fold it up and put it on a shelf on a flat piece of wood. You want to put it on what would be called a “hanger” (hanger) so that it hangs from a pole – basically, a large meta l stick. Clothing is put on racks so that people can go through them quickly and find  what they need.

The sales clerk said, “Hi, can I help you find some thing?” That's a very common expression when you walk into a store. The sales cl erk will ask you if you need help. I say, “Oh, I'm just browsing.” “To browse” ( browse) means to be shopping but not looking for anything specific. It's a good thing to say to a sales clerk when you walk into a store when you don't really want the sales clerk to help you or to try to sell you something. You just want to be left  alone. Then, you can say, “Oh, I'm just browsing. Thank you.” The sales clerk know s then not to bother you unless you ask for help.

The sales clerk in this case says exactly that: “Ok ay, let me know if you need any help” – ask me if you want me to help you. “I told her thanks, and started looking around the store.” I found some dress pants on some  racks. “Dress pants” are nice pants – not jeans, but pants you could wear, f or example, to a wedding. “I made my way toward the back of the store and found the same pair of pants I saw in the window display.” “To make your way” some where is to move in that direction.

It's often the case in stores that they will put the items, the products, the things that are on sale – that are discounted – in the bac k of the store. They want you to walk through all of the new expensive things before  you get to the cheap things in the back. Well, I was looking for the cheap thin gs. So, I walked to the back of the store and found the same pair of pants I had se en in the window display. I then say, “They were on sale!” When we say somethin g is “on sale,” we mean it is at a lower price. It has been discounted. You pa y a lower price than what you would normally pay.

I started looking for my size; I started looking for a pair of pants that would fit me. “To fit” someone means that the clothing looks good  on them. I say, “There were plenty of smalls and larges, but no mediums.” Sizes  of clothing come basically in one of three categories: small, medium, or large. “ Medium” would be in between, of course, “small” and “large.” They're not exact t erms. And different stores will have different ways of deciding what's a small vers us a large versus a medium. It can be a little confusing. When you buy clothing on  the Internet, they'll usually have a chart – an area that you can see what they m ean by a small, what the actual size in inches is of the piece of clothing, for example.

“The sales clerk was walking by just then,” right a t the time I was looking, “so I asked her, ‘Do you have any other sizes in the back ?’” When you ask a sales clerk if they have something “in the back” or “in b ack,” you are asking whether they have anything that is not out for the public to see, that is stored in the back of the store, typically, that they haven't put out for people to buy yet. Sometimes people will buy things and the store hasn't had tim e to put new items to replace the ones that have been purchased. That's why you a lways want to ask if the store has more sizes in back if you can't find your  size on the rack or in the front parts of the store.

I then say, “I was out of luck. This was all they h ad.” That means that the sales clerk told me they did not have more sizes in the b ack, and therefore I could not buy a medium of the pair of pants I wanted. “But,” she said, “I have another pair of pants in a medium” – in a medium-size – “and the y've been marked down too.” When we say something has been “marked (marked) dow n,” we mean the price has been lowered. The item has been discounted. You  will pay a lower price now that it has been marked down. It's really just anot her way of saying “on sale.”

The clerk asked me if I would like to try them on. “To try on” clothing means to put it on your body to see if you like it, to see i f it fits. I said I did want to try the pair of pants on, and I followed her back “to the d ressing room.” The “dressing room” is the place in a clothing store where you ca n try on clothes. Basically they’re little closets that you can walk into that typically have a mirror in them so

you can look at yourself and see how wonderful you look in the new piece of clothing. The clerk gave me her name and said that I should let her know if I needed anything else.

I say, “I tried the pants on and they fit perfectly . I liked the color, too.” So, I say, “I took the pair of pants to the register.” The “regis ter” (register) is a machine, nowadays typically a computer, that is used to reco rd whatever you are purchasing and a place to put the money you give th em to buy the item, to buy the product. When I say it records it, I mean it en ters it – nowadays, into a computer system – so the store knows how many peopl e bought that particular item. A “register” used to be just a place where yo u would give them the money and they would keep the money. Now, it's a more sop histicated computer.

The clerk asked, “Are you ready?” I told her I was,  and “she started ringing me up.” “To ring up” someone or “to ring someone up” is a phrasal verb meaning to take someone's money in exchange for something they  are buying from you. “To ring someone up” is to take the money, give them a receipt, and give them what they are buying. That’s the process of ringing some one up. Basically, it's taking the money.

The clerk told me the “total” – the amount I had to  pay – and asked how I would like to pay for this. What the clerk is asking here  is do I want to give her cash, or do I want to use a credit card? Many years ago, a l ot of stores would also accept personal checks, but that's not very common in most  stores anymore. You have to pay either with cash or credit card. I told the clerk I would be paying with my MasterCard type of credit card, and I “handed” her the card; I gave her the card.

“She processed the card” – she rung me up – “and as ked me to sign the credit card receipt.” You have to sign the receipt so the credit card company can verify that it's you. Nowadays, you often sign the credit card slips electronically with a pen on, again, a small pad, a small little machine,  that's connected to the computer that records your signature as you write it. The clerk gave me a copy of the receipt and a bag with my pants in it. She said , “There you go. I hope you like the pair of pants. Thanks for coming in,” meaningthanks for coming into the store and buying something. I thanked her and left.

I then say, “I couldn't believe I got my shopping d one so quickly. There is a first time for everything.” This expression, “There is a first time for everything,” is one that we use when something happens for the first ti me and, usually, that you have never experienced before. Sometimes the phrase  is used almost to make a joke. Someone says, “Are you going to go camping th is weekend?” You might say, “Well, no. I hate camping, but maybe there's a  first time for everything.”

 Of course, whenever you do something, you have nece ssarily to do it a first time before you can do it a second time. The idea of the  expression, then, is that this is something that I've never done before. Or, if yo u're trying to make a joke, it might be something that you probably won't do, but it would be possible for you to do.

Now is listen to the story, this time at a normal s peed.

[start of story]

I needed a new pair of pants for a wedding I was at tending next week, so I went to the mall during my lunch hour. The mall had a bi g variety of stores, including two department stores, so I was sure to find someth ing that was just right. I found a space in the parking structure and entered the ma ll through the main entrance. This was right next to the food court.

Okay, where to start?

I headed to one of the two department stores. On the way there, though, I saw a nice pair of pants in a window display of a men’s c lothing store. I decided to go in. As I walked in, I saw a sales clerk hanging som e shirts on a rack.

She said, “Hi, can I help you find something?”

“Oh, I’m just browsing,” I said.

“Okay. Let me know if you need any help.” I told he r thanks, and started looking around the store. There were some nice sweaters fol ded on the shelves and some dress pants on the racks. I made my way toward  the back of the store and found the same pair of pants I saw in the window di splay. And, they were on sale! They were 50 percent off. I started looking f or my size. There were plenty of smalls and larges, but no mediums.

The sales clerk was walking by just then so I asked  her, “Do you have any other sizes in the back?” But, I was out of luck. This wa s all they had. “But,” she said, “I have another pair of pants in a medium and they’ve been marked down, too. Would you like to try them on?”

I said I did and followed her to the dressing room.  She said, “My name is Cheryl. Let me know if you need anything else.” I tried the  pants on and they fit perfectly. I liked the color, too.

 I took the pair of pants to the register. The sales  clerk asked, “Are you ready?” I told her I was and she started ringing me up. The c lerk told me the total and asked me, “How would you like to pay for this?”

“With my MasterCard,” I said and handed her my cred it card.

She processed the card and asked me sign the credit  card receipt. She handed me a copy and a bag with my new pair of pants in it . She said, “There you go. I hope you like the pair of pants. Thanks for coming in.”

I thanked her and left. I couldn’t believe I got my  shopping done so quickly. There’s a first time for everything.

# Seeing a Play

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 78 – Seeing a Play.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 78. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today's episode is going to be about going to the theater to see a play. Let's go.  > I ran into my neighbor Dennis yesterday afternoon. He asked if I wanted two tickets to the theater. He had season tickets but c ouldn't go to this performance. It was opening night of Shakespeare's The Tempest . I jumped at his offer and invited Lucy to come along.
> We arrived at the theater half an hour before openi ng curtain. We had the tickets in hand and didn't need to pick them up at the will  call window. The doors to the theater were open and we handed our tickets to the ticket takers standing in the doorway.

> At the end of the second act, there was an intermis sion. Lucy and I went into the lobby and bought drinks from the bar. After about 1 5 minutes, the lights flickered and we went back to our seats.
> After the last act, the audience gave the actors a standing ovation. This was the best play I had seen in ages. The acting was superb , and the staging and direction were fresh. I couldn't have asked for a b etter theater experience. I owed Dennis big time for giving me his tickets.

In this episode, we went to the theater to see a pl ay. I begin the story by saying, “I ran into my neighbor Dennis yesterday afternoon. ” “To run into someone” means to meet someone whom you weren't expecting to  meet.

Dennis asked me “if I wanted two tickets to the the ater.” A “theater” is a place where you go and see a play – a live, dramatic perf ormance. Dennis had season tickets. “Season (season) tickets” are tickets for several different performances – by the same group of actors, in this case – during a certain period of time. Usually, season tickets for a theater include all of the performances for the four or five months, perhaps more, when the theater is h aving performances.

You can have season tickets to a lot of different k inds of events. You could have season tickets to a professional football team, or to a college football team, or to a professional soccer team. That means you have tic kets for all of their games throughout the entire year, throughout the season w hen they are playing. Sometimes the season can go across two different ca lendar years. It might start in September and end in May of the following year, but we would still call those “season tickets.” I say that Dennis “had season tic kets but couldn't go to this performance,” couldn't go to this particular night when the play was being performed.

“It was opening night of Shakespeare's The Tempest ,” I say. “Opening night” is the first night that the play can be seen. It's the  first night of the performance of the play or concert or whatever the event is. This was Shakespeare's The Tempest  – one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, actually. I say that “I jumped at his offer.” “To jump at” something means to immedia tely accept it, to enthusiastically accept it. “The beautiful woman as ked me to dance, and I jumped at the opportunity.” For some reason, my wif e didn't like that. I'm not sure why.

I say that I “invited Lucy to come along” – to come  with me. “We arrived at the theater half an hour before opening curtain.” So, w e arrived at the building where the play was going to be performed 30 minutes befor e it began. “Opening curtain” is when the play begins. I say, “We had the tickets in hand,” we had them with us, “and didn't need to pick them up” (or get them) “at the will call window.”

A “will call window” is a place where you get your tickets if you have already purchased them in advance, before the performance. Sometimes, you buy a ticket and perhaps you don't have a chance to get them mailed to you, although nowadays a lot of these things are done electronica lly. If that happens, you can go to the theater, to the “will call window,” and t hat's a place where you pick up tickets you've already paid for, typically. I say, “The doors to the theater were open and we handed” – or gave – “our tickets to the  ticket takers.” A “ticket taker” does exactly what you might expect. He takes your t icket from you and allows you into wherever you're going – in this case, the theater.

Lucy and I “looked for our seats and were pleasantl y surprised” – meaning it was a good surprise – “to find that we had some of the best seats in the house.” The expression “the best seats in the house” means the best place to sit in order to see some event, for example in the theater or a sta dium. The best seats in the house would be the seats perhaps right next to the theater stage or right next to the performers. “House” here doesn't refer to an ac tual house where you live. We don't mean the best chairs in your home. We mean the best place to sit in an auditorium or theater in order to see and enjoy the  performance. I say, “I thought we would be sitting in the balcony.”

The “balcony” (balcony) is the section of seats tha t is above the main floor where the seats are. It's sort of like the second, or per haps third or fourth, area above the main floor where you sit – what's sometimes cal led the “orchestra section,” the section that would be right next to the orchest ra, if there were an orchestra for a musical performance such as an opera. The bal cony is either on the side of the theater or in the back of the theater, above the main floor of the theater. Sometimes balcony seats aren't very good because th ey are located at a greater distance than the seats that are on the main floor or the orchestra section.

I say that “the lights dimmed and the curtain went up.” “To dim” (dim) means to make the lights get darker slowly. So, you are lowe ring the level or the intensity of the lights. “Dimming the lights” doesn't mean tu rning the lights off completely; it just means making them darker or making the area wh ere you are darker.

I say, “The lights dimmed and the curtain went up.”  “The curtain went up” means to say that the performance began. The “curtain” he re refers to a large piece of material, usually made of cloth, that hangs at the front of the stage. When the play begins, the curtain goes up, or sometimes the curtain is drawn on both sides. It moves on both sides so that you can then see the actors and what is called the “scenery” – the physical background for the play.

I then say, “At the end of the second act, there wa s an intermission.” The word “act” here is used to describe a section or part of  a play. When we talk about a play “in three acts,” there are three major parts of the play, or three major sections of the story. “Intermission” (intermission ) is a break between sections of the play. Typically, there's one intermission in a play that comes somewhere in the middle of the play, or a little after the middl e of the play. “Intermissions” are generally short – 10 or 15 minutes is typical.

This intermission was 15 minutes. After the intermi ssion was over, after the 15 minutes were over, “the lights flickered.” “To flic ker” (flicker) is for the lights in a theater or anywhere to quickly come on and off. This could happen because

you're having electrical problems. But when it’s do ne in a theater, it's a way of indicating to everyone who is standing outside the theater, or inside the theater, that the play is going to start again, that intermi ssion is now over. It's a sign for you to go back and sit down in your seat. This has nothing to do with the popular photography website “Flickr,” which is spelled with out an “e” for some reason.

I say that “after the last act, the audience gave the actors a standing ovation.” A “standing ovation” (ovation) is when everyone stand s up on their feet and claps. That's called a “standing ovation.” I say, “This wa s the best play I had seen in ages.” “In ages” means in a very long time. “The ac ting was superb” – that is, excellent – “and the staging and direction were fre sh.”

“Staging” (staging) is the design and organization of the things on the actual stage where the play is performed – where they put the chairs, where they put the table, and so forth. “Direction” refers to what  the director does. The director is the person who tells the actors how to say their li nes, how to act, how to behave during different parts of the play. All of that wou ld be part of the direction. I call the direction “fresh.” “Fresh” here means new. It d oesn't seem as though the director just took old ideas and put them up there.  He came up with something new.

I close the story by saying, “I couldn't have asked  for a better theater experience. I owed Dennis big time for giving me his tickets.” The expression “could not have asked for” is used to explain certain ideal conditi ons, to explain that the situation was as good as I could hope for. It's the best poss ible situation; it could not have been better. That's why we say we “couldn't have as ked for more.” It wouldn't be possible, because this was already so good.

“To owe someone big time” means very much – to be i n someone's debt, to have to pay someone back a great deal because of somethi ng they have done for you. In general, the term “big time” just means very muc h. And that's what I'm saying at the end of the story.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I ran into my neighbor Dennis yesterday afternoon. He asked if I wanted two tickets to the theater. He had season tickets but c ouldn't go to this performance. It was opening night of Shakespeare's The Tempest . I jumped at his offer and invited Lucy to come along.

We arrived at the theater half an hour before openi ng curtain. We had the tickets in hand and didn't need to pick them up at the will  call window. The doors to the theater were open and we handed our tickets to the ticket takers standing in the doorway.

We looked for our seats and were pleasantly surpris ed to find that we had some of the best seats in the house! I thought we would be sitting in the balcony, but we were in the orchestra section in the center. This was great! The lights dimmed and the curtain went up.

At the end of the second act, there was an intermis sion. Lucy and I went into the lobby and bought drinks from the bar. After about 1 5 minutes, the lights flickered and we went back to our seats.

After the last act, the audience gave the actors a standing ovation. This was the best play I had seen in ages. The acting was superb , and the staging and direction were fresh. I couldn't have asked for a b etter theater experience. I owed Dennis big time for giving me his tickets.

# Disagreeing Politely in a Business Setting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 79: Disagreeing Politely in a Business Setting.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 79: Disagreeing Politely in a Business Setting. I’m you r host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development located in b eautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about disagreeing with people yo u work with. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: I don't think this is going to work. This pla n calls for the new office to open by July and I think that's too ambitious. I don't s ee how the groundwork can be done any earlier than September.

Jeff: I understand your concern. I don't want to ru sh the opening of the new office either. But, as I see it, a lot of the preparations  were made last year when we considered opening an office in Miami. Even though the site is different, a lot of the cost projections are the same.

Lucy: That may be, but remember that one of the rea sons we scrapped the Miami plan was because the budget was too big.

Jeff: That's not how I saw it. I think the major re ason we didn't go ahead with the Miami plan was a problem with timing but I know tha t the budget was a concern, too. As you can see, though, this plan has a lower budget than the Miami plan.

Lucy: I don't agree. If you add in all of the extra s, the budget is the same, if not higher. I think we need to go back to the drawing b oard on this.

Jeff: I have to disagree. This plan is the best we' ve come up with and is workable.

Lucy: I'm afraid we just don't see eye to eye on th is. Let's call a meeting with the rest of the team and see what they think.

Jeff: Okay, let's do that.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking about disagreements at work in this p odcast. We start off by having Lucy say that she doesn’t think “this plan is going  to work.” When we say something is “going to work” or “it works,” we mean  that it functions properly or it does what it’s supposed to do. You can talk about a  plan or a proposal to do something as “working” or “not working” you can als o talk about a computer as “working” or “not working” or any machine as “worki ng,” meaning it’s functioning, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do.

Lucy said that the plan that they are talking about  “calls for” the new office. When we say something “calls for” we mean that that’s wh at it says, that’s what it says should happen. We often use this expression when we  are talking about a plan for something or a policy for something. “The polic y calls for everyone to meet with their boss once a year,” meaning that’s what it tells people to do. This plan calls for opening a new office and Lucy thinks that  it’s “too ambitious.” The plan is “too ambitious.” “Ambitious” is an adjective which means that you are trying to do a lot, probably in this case, according to Lucy, to o much. When someone is “ambitious” – a person is “ambitious,” that means t hat they want to be successful, they want to do better, they want to be the best in  whatever it is that they do. For a plan to be “ambitious” we mean that it’s trying to do a lot and perhaps too much.

Lucy says she doesn’t see how the “groundwork” can be done. The “groundwork,” all one word, “ground” and “work” tog ether, the “groundwork” for anything is the foundation. It’s the work that has to be done before anything else can be done. So, if you are going to, for example, take a trip, to do the “groundwork” or to – we often use the verb “to lay. ” “To lay the groundwork” means that you do all the things required before yo u start on your trip. You buy your tickets, you investigate, you know, hotels and  that sort of thing. So, you can “lay the groundwork” for a project, a plan, or any sort of event.

This podcast is about expressing disagreement polit ely and you’ll notice that we start off very polite and then we become a little l ess polite, never becoming the opposite of polite, which is “rude.” We’re not rude  to each other.  We’re very polite and then we’re somewhat polite. We start off  being very polite. I say to Lucy, “I understand your concern.” “Your concern” is something that you are worried about. It’s what you are trying to discuss in our conversation. And this expression, “I understand your concern,” is often u sed when the person doesn’t necessarily agree with you but they want to be nice  about it and they want to say that they understand what the other person’s point of view is or opinion is.

I mentioned that the plans that call for the new of fice were based upon another plan in Miami and I said that the “cost projections ” are the same. “Cost projections” is a noun that we use in business to t alk about the amount of money that we have to spend for a certain product, servic e, or project. So, the “cost projections” are like the predictions. A “projectio n” is your best guess about what something is going to be, and “cost projections” are your estimate of how much things are going to cost you, how much money you’re  going to have to spend. Lucy then, again, disagrees with me politely. She s ays, “That may be, but remember,” and gives me her opinion. The expression , “That may be,” means that she is saying that what I just said is correct  but she has something else that supports her opinion. So, when you say to someone “ Well, that maybe but,” you’re disagreeing with them. You’re saying that wh at they are saying is correct but that’s not the most important thing, that what you have to say more important or is more appropriate.

Lucy said that one of the reasons we “scrapped” the  Miami plan was because the budget was too big. “To scrap something” means to g et rid of it, to cancel it, to decide not to do something. We often talk about our  plans being “scrapped.” “I scrapped my plans to go to New York this week becau se it’s too cold,” or “I scrapped an idea.” We scrap that idea, we decided n ot to use it. I disagree with Lucy again, and now we’re becoming a little less fo rmal, a little less polite here. I say, “That’s not how I saw it.” The expression, “Th is is how I see it,” or “That’s not how I see it,” means that’s not my opinion or that is my opinion. “To see something,” here, means to understand it. “How do y ou understand it?” or “What is your opinion about this topic?” I say that the p roblem with the Miami plan was with “timing.” “Timing” (timing) refers to or means  the schedule, when you were going to do something. So, “timing” has to do with when something gets done.

Lucy then disagrees with me in the most direct way possible. She says, “I don’t agree.” And when you say to someone in a business s etting, “I don’t agree,” often you know that person well enough because it’s  a very direct way of disagreeing with someone. “I don’t agree.” She says  that when you add in all the “extras” for the plan, the budget for this plan is still the same. The “extras” are things that are additional. We say that “I’m going to throw in some extras” – means I’m going to give you some additional things.

Lucy says that she thinks we need to “go back to the drawing board” on this. The expression, “to go back to the drawing board,” mean s that you have to start over. A “drawing board” is literally the table or the des k where an artist or an architect draws plans for a building, for example. I then als o am very direct in my disagreement. I say to Lucy, “I have to disagree.” This is basically the same as “I disagree.” It has a little bit more politeness to it. “I have to disagree,” That’s a little

more polite in English but I’m still being fairly d irect. Lucy says to me that we just “don’t see eye to eye” on this. “Eye” (eye) like yo ur eye in your head, “eye to eye” means that we agree, or in this case, we don’t agre e. When you say to someone, “We see eye to eye on this,” that means we agree an d, of course, if you don’t “see eye to eye,” you don’t agree.

Lucy suggests that we “call a meeting.” “To call a meeting” means that we’re going to have a meeting – announce the meeting to e veryone who has to come. So, that verb we use – “to call” – is very common w ith meetings or other types of gatherings when people get together.

Okay. Now let’s listen to the story or dialogue aga in, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy: I don't think this is going to work. This pla n calls for the new office to open by July and I think that's too ambitious. I don't s ee how the groundwork can be done any earlier than September.

Jeff: I understand your concern. I don't want to ru sh the opening of the new office either. But, as I see it, a lot of the preparations  were made last year when we considered opening an office in Miami. Even though the site is different, a lot of the cost projections are the same.

Lucy: That may be, but remember that one of the rea sons we scrapped the Miami plan was because the budget was too big.

Jeff: That's not how I saw it. I think the major re ason we didn't go ahead with the Miami plan was a problem with timing but I know tha t the budget was a concern, too. As you can see, though, this plan has a lower budget than the Miami plan.

Lucy: I don't agree. If you add in all of the extra s, the budget is the same, if not higher. I think we need to go back to the drawing b oard on this.

Jeff: I have to disagree. This plan is the best we' ve come up with and is workable.

Lucy: I'm afraid we just don't see eye to eye on th is. Let's call a meeting with the rest of the team and see what they think.

Jeff: Okay, let's do that.

# Asking for Directions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 80: Asking for Directions.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast number 80. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast is about listening or rather asking for directions. So, let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I went to Vancouver for a meeting this week. I have  always liked Vancouver, and on top of that, my cousin Dominick just moved there . I got in touch with him and he invited me over to see his new place.

On the way over, though, I got a little lost. I kne w I was in the right area, but I was turned around. He lived in an apartment over an old  bakery and I couldn't find it.

I stopped a man who was walking by to ask for direc tions.

Lucy: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building?

Man: The Cross Bakery building? Oh sure. You're act ually walking in the opposite direction.

Lucy: Oh, you're kidding! I thought I was heading e ast.

Man: No, east is the other direction. To get to the  Bakery, you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway. When you ge t to the intersection of Broadway and Elm, you hang a left. Go straight down  that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left.

Lucy: Okay, let me see if I've got that. I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway, then I make a left and the building is on my left- hand side. Is that right?

Man: Yeah, you've got it. Do you want me to show yo u the way?

Lucy: Thanks for the offer, but I think I've got it . Hopefully, I won't get lost again on my way there!

 [end of dialogue]

This podcast is about asking for directions, h. How  to get somewhere when you are lost or don’t know where to go. This story begi ns with Lucy going to Vancouver and she says she likes Vancouver but “on top of that” her cousin Dominick just moved there. The expression, “on top of that,” means in addition to. It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thi ng. – In t Tthis case, it’s a good thing. “I’m going to a Hawaii and on top of that I’ m going to take a cruise around the islands,” – something additional, something bet ter. Lucy says that she “got in touch” with her cousin. “To get in touch with someo ne” means to contact them. We often say to people, “Stay in touch,” meaning ke ep in contact with me. Call me every few weeks or few months, whatever it happe ns to be. But when Lucy says she “got in touch” that means she called or co mmunicated, maybe emailed her cousin. He “e” invited her over” to see his new  place. “To invite someone over,” – one of those two-word verbs we’ve talked a  lot about. “To invite over” means you’re inviting someone to come to your locat ion. If someone says, “I want to invite you over to dinner,” they mean, “I want you to come to my house for dinner.” But if someone says, “I want to invite  you to dinner,” usually that means you’re going to go to a restaurant.

The new “place” that Lucy is visiting is just anoth er word for the new house or the new apartment. People refer to where they live some times as their “place.” “My place is located near Santa Monica, California.” It  can be anywhere you’re living. Lucy said that she “got a little lost.” “To get los t,” here means that you couldn’t find your way, – you didn’t know where you were. the expression, “get lost,” when you say that to someone as a command,  – “You,  get lost!” – wWe’re saying we want you to leave. It’s kind of something  that you would say to someone you don’t like and you want them to leave. – “Get lost!”

Lucy said that she was “turned around” when she was  trying to find her cousin’s apartment. “To be turned around” or to be “all turn ed around” – means that you’re not sure which direction you are travelling in. “I went to downtown Los Angeles and there were many one-way streets, – streets wher e you can only move in one direction, – and I got all turned around;” – I didn ’t know where I was.” Lucy says, “Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Cro ss Bakery building?” She begins in asking for directions, by saying, “Excuse  me” which is a common way of getting someone’s attention that you – particula rly someone that you don’t know. It’s a polite way of getting their attention.  The expression, “Could you tell me how to get to,” means can you give me directions  on how to arrive to this particular place. So, she asks for directions to a bakery and the man says, “Sure, I can tell you but you’re walking in the opposite d irection.” He means here that

she is going, for example, north, when she should b e going towards the south, – the other direction, – opposite of what she is trav elling. So, east would be west, west would be east.

Lucy says, “Oh, you’re kidding!” The expression “Yo u’re kidding” (kidding) means here that she is surprised by the response that she  gets. “To kid someone” (kid) – “to kid,” as a verb, – means to joke with them, –  not to tell them the truth but in a sort of fun or joking manner. So, when Lucy says,  “You’re kidding!” – sShe’s saying, “Wow, are you sure? I didn’t realize;” – th at surprises me.” The other expression is “I’m kidding,” and when someone says,  “I’m kidding,” or “Just kidding,” they mean they’re joking, they’re not tel ling the truth. Lucy says that she thought she was “heading” east. “To head” in a dire ction”,  – east, west, north, south, – means that you are travelling or going, – walking, driving, etc., – in that direction. You can also “head” to a particular plac e. “I’m heading to the store” means I’m going to the store. The man tells Lucy th at east is the “other direction,” meaning pretty much the same here as the opposite d irection.

He gives her instructions by telling her that she n eeds to “turn around and go three blocks to Broadway.” When you tell someone to  “turn around,” you mean to go in the opposite direction. He says that she need s to go three “blocks.” A “block” is – in a city – is the distance between tw o streets – is one “block.” She needs to go three “blocks” and when she gets to the  “intersection” of Broadway and Elm, she should “hang a left.” The “intersectio n is the place where two streets cross and the expression “to hang a left” is informal. It means to “take a left” or “to go left.” Notice the expression is “ha ng a left” or “take a left.” You can also say, “mMake a left.”  A – all those are the sa me. You can, of course, also “hang a right,” or “make a right” or “take a right. ” The expression using the verb “turn,” however, doesn’t take the article “a” or (a ). So, you “turn right” not “turn a right.” You “turn right,” you “turn left.” T– that means the same as to make a right, – to take a right or to hang a right. “Hang” is ver y informal, however.

The man then tells her to “go straight down the str eet.” “To go straight” means don’t go left, don’t go right – go in the direction  you are walking.” And the building she is looking for will be “on your left,” meaning on the left-hand side. Lucy repeats the directions back. She says, “Okay, I nee d to go down Elm until I hit Broadway.” “To go down a street” just means to trav el or to move down a street in your car or by walking. “To go down to Elm until  she hits Broadway” – when we say, “You should go to this in this direction until  you hit a street or a freeway or a road” we mean until you arrive there. “Go until you  hit 5th Street then hang a right” means drive until you reach or arrive at 5th  street and turn right.

Lucy said then that she needs to “make a left.” A– again, we talked about that expression and the building will be on her “left-ha nd side.” “Left-hand” side” is the same as on your left.

At the end the man says, “Do you want me to show yo u the way?” “To show someone the way” means you’re going to take them or  they are going to follow you. I’m going to show you the way, – the route or how you get there. The man may be interested in more than just helping Lucy he re, we might guess. And Lucy says, “Thanks for the offer” – means thank you  for offering or for volunteering to help me. Anything that you offer or  say that you will do for another person, you could use this expression. – “Thanks for the offer of taking my car to the mechanic.” Notice we would offer --, in this ex pression, we use the preposition “of” and then we use the verb in the “- ing” form. “Thanks for the offer of going to the store for me.” But Lucy “turns down ” the offer, and that’s the verb we use, to “turn down” an offer, – to say no. The o pposite would be to “accept” an offer, – to say yes. Lucy says that “I’ve got it ,” and what she means here is she understands. When someone says, “I’ve got it” –  means, “Yes, I understand. I don’t need any more help.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I went to Vancouver for a meeting this week. I have  always liked Vancouver, and on top of that, my cousin Dominick just moved there . I got in touch with him and he invited me over to see his new place.

# Airplane Announcements

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 81: Airplane Announcements.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 81. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center f or Educational Development in beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii – just kidding – in L os Angeles, California. Be sure to visit our website at www.eslpod.com.

Today’s podcast is about airplane announcements, wh at you hear when you take an airplane in the United States. Let’s go! > I had to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles recent ly and, like most travelers, I've almost memorized the standard safety announcement m ade by the flight attendants. It goes something like this:
> Good afternoon and welcome to Flight 345, service to Los Angeles International Airport. We appreciate your full attention to this important safety announcement. This 747 aircraft is equipped with four emergency e xits, two in the front of the plane and two in the aft. Be sure to identify the n earest exit to you, which may be behind you. If the plane should lose pressure, an o xygen mask will drop from the compartment above your seat. Reach up, pull down on  the mask until the tubing is fully extended, place the mask over your nose an d mouth, secure it with the elastic band, and breathe normally.
> Passenger seat cushions on this aircraft may be use d as a flotation device and detailed instructions may be found on the safety in formation card in the seat pocket in front of you. Smoking is not permitted at  any time while on board this aircraft. Also, federal law prohibits tampering, di sabling, or destroying these detectors in the lavatories. Your compliance with a ll crew member instructions, all placards, and lighted seat belt and no smoking sign s is required.
> The following electronic devices may not be used du ring takeoff or landing: portable compact disk players, portable computers, and cellular phones, which should be in the off position and stowed. Now, in p reparation for take-off, please fasten your seatbelt, return your seatback and tray  tables to the full upright and locked position. Your carry- on luggage must be sto wed in the overhead compartments or underneath the seat in front of you . On behalf of all Mar Vista
> Today we are on an airplane, listening to the openi ng, or beginning, announcement from the “flight attendants.” The “fli ght attendant” is the man or woman who works in the plane that gives you your co ffee and gives you safety information and so forth. A “safety announcement” is what we listen to today. A “safety announcement” is the announcement the fligh t attendant makes to tell you all the rules that you have to follow on the ai rplane. The announcement begins by saying that “this is flight 345, service to Los Angeles International Airport.” “Service to” just means that is where the  plane is going. It’s where this plane is going to land. You can sometimes be on a p lane that is going to more than one city so they may say, “Service to Los Ange les International Airport and continuing on,” or going on, to, for example, San F rancisco. So, when they say, “continuing on,” they mean this plane is going to s top and then it’s going to go somewhere else.

The airplane that we are in here is also called an “aircraft,” all one word, “aircraft” is the same as the “airplane.” It’s the actual plan e you are in. The announcement says that this aircraft is “equipped with four emer gency exits.” When we say it’s “equipped” – something that is “equipped” (equipped ), we mean it has. It’s usually something we talk about for a machine or, i n this case a plane, or a car. You can say your car is “equipped with air-conditio ning” – means it has air- conditioning in it. “Four emergency exits.”  The “e mergency exits,” you probably know, are the doors in the plane where you escape f rom if you are in an emergency. There are usually a couple of these door s. In this announcement there were two in the front of the plane and two in  the “aft.” “Aft” (aft) is the back of the plane – just means the back of a vehicle, in  this case a plane. The flight attendant says that “You should look for the neares t exit to you, which may be behind you,” meaning you may have to go back in the  plane to the closest door.

The announcement continues that, “If the plane shou ld lose pressure, an oxygen mask will drop from the compartment above.” For a p lane to fly, in order for you to breathe, it has to be “pressurized,” meaning the  air has to be “pressurized” so that you can breathe it. If an airplane loses press ure if, for example, there’s a problem or there is a hole in the plane and it lose s pressure, you will not be able to breathe and that’s why airplanes have oxygen mas ks. An “oxygen mask” – a mask, you probably know, is what goes over your fac e. An “oxygen mask” is something that goes over your mouth and your nose a nd you can breathe oxygen in order to breathe properly. It comes down from the “compartment”

above your seat. “Compartment” just means a place w here something is stored – something that you keep something. Anything can be a “compartment” but we use this term especially in airplanes. The “compart ment above you” just means in the space above you in the airplane.

Now, the instructions here are to “reach up,” in ot her words, to put your hand up and take the oxygen mask until the “tubing is fully  extended.” The “tubing” is – a “tube” is a round, usually hollow, meaning it’s emp ty inside, thing that you can put water or gas.  In this case, oxygen can go through.  You can have “tubes” in all sorts of places. Here, you have “tubing” from the c ompartment in the plane, on the top, to the mask so the oxygen goes through. for something to be “fully extended” just means that it is out as far as it ca n go, you have the tube so that it is as long as you can get it. The instructions are to put this mask over your nose and mouth, “secure it with an elastic band and brea the normally.” “To secure something” means to make sure that it isn’t going to move. So, you’re “securing it,” meaning you’re putting it on your face and you ’re using an elastic band. An “elastic band” is something that stretches and we u se those to keep something on our head like a mask. You can also use an “elast ic band” for putting something together, for example, you have a bunch of pens. I have a bunch of pens sitting in front of me and they are put togeth er with a rubber band or “elastic band.”

A “seat cushion” is what you are sitting on in the airplane, and “seat cushions” can be used in an emergency as “flotation devices.”  The verb “to float” means to stay on top of the water. It doesn’t go down into the water. It doesn’t sink (sink). The opposite of “to float” is to sink. A “flotation  device” is just a fancy way of saying something that will not sink. So, if you can ’t swim, you have a “flotation device” that keeps you, or your head above water. A irplanes in the United States also have little cards, little pieces of paper, tha t give these instructions on how to use certain emergency parts of the airplane. Now, w e call this a “safety information card,” information about safety. And yo u can find these in the “seat pocket” in front of you. The “seat pocket” is the p ocket that is on the seat that is directly in front of you.  It’s on the back of the seat in front of you and it’s where you put magazines and newspapers and the “safety in formation card.”

In the United States, “smoking” is not allowed on a ny airplane and the announcement says, “Smoking is not permitted while on board this aircraft. To be “on board” an airplane means to be on the airplane,  to be physically – your body is present on the airplane. When you get onto an ai rplane, the verb we use is “to board” (board). “To board” an airplane means to get  on the airplane. The opposite would be “to de-board” (de-board), to get off an airplane. And when you are on it, we say you are “on board.” “Federal law, ” which is to say, the United

States government, prohibits tampering, disabling, or destroying smoke detectors in lavatories. “To tamper with something” (tamper) is a verb which means to change it, to do something to it so that it doesn’t  work. “To disable” is similar. “Disable” (disable) is a verb, which means to make a machine or something to stop working, so very similar with tampering. “Tamp ering” doesn’t necessarily mean that you break it, but you change it somehow, whereas, “to disable” means to make the machine not work.” The “detectors” or “ smoke detectors” are, of course, those little, usually round things that if there’s smoke, it begins to buzz; it begins to make a noise. These are in the “lavatorie s.” A “lavatory” is just another word in English for a bathroom or the restroom.

The announcement also says that “Your compliance wi th all crew member instructions, all placards, and lighted seatbelts s igns is required.” “Compliance” is a noun. The verb is “to comply” (comply). “To compl y” means to follow someone’s orders, to do what you are told to do. “C rew members” are anyone who works for the airline that is on the airplane. That would be the pilot, the co- pilot, the flight attendants, so forth; these are a ll “crew members” (crew), “crew member”. A “placard” (placard) – a “placard” is jus t a fancy word in English for a “sign.” So, there’s a sign that says, “No smoking.”  That could be called a “placard.” The electronic devices that you can take  on an airplane, such as a compact disc player, a computer, cellular phone or mobile phone, cannot be used “during take-off or landing.” “Take-off,” and the verb is “to take off,” means when the plane is going up into the air. And “to la nd,” or a “landing” as a noun, means when the plane is coming back down on the gro und. The cellular phone or mobile phones have to be in the “off position” –  means they have to be turned off and “stowed.” “To stow something” (stow) just m eans to store it, to put it in a certain place so that it is safe. We use that word a lot when talking about airplanes or ships or boats. We talk about “stowing  planes”-- just means where you store something, where you put something.

The announcement finishes by saying that you should  “fasten your seatbelt.” Of course, your “seatbelt,” all one word, “seatbelt” is what goes around your waist so that you don’t fall out of your seat if there’s an emergency. It also tells you to “return your seatback and tray tables into the full  upright and locked position.” Couple of different phrases or words here, first of  all, “seatback.” “Seatback” is the part of your seat, or the chair if you will, yo u’re sitting in – that’s the part of the seat that goes back and forth. So, you can lean bac k. You can put your seat back. The verb we would use here is “to recline.” You can “recline” (recline) your seat back, but when you are taking off and landing,  it has to be in its “upright” position. “To be upright,” all one word (upright), means to be straight, not to be leaning forward or leaning backwards.

The “tray table” is that little piece of plastic th at comes down from the seat in front of you where you can put your meal and your coffee and your books. It’s like a little table. A “tray table” is a small table that has to be also in its upright and locked position. You have to put the little lock on  it so it doesn’t fall down. Finally, you’re told that, “Your carry-on luggage must be st owed in the overhead compartments.” “Carry-on luggage,” you can guess, is the luggage that you “carry on,” or take on to the airplane. The opposit e of “carry-on” would be your “checked luggage.” Your “checked luggage” is the lu ggage that is down below, underneath the airplane. The “carry-on” is what you  put either above your head, and those spaces above your head are called the “ov erhead compartments.” We sometimes call these the “overhead bins” (bins), sa me thing as a compartment. Or they have to be put in the seat in front of you.

Now let’s listen to the announcement again this tim e at a native rate of speech.

[start of story]

I had to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles recent ly and, like most travelers, I've almost memorized the standard safety announcement m ade by the flight attendants. It goes something like this:

Good afternoon and welcome to Flight 345, service to Los Angeles International Airport. We appreciate your full attention to this important safety announcement. This 747 aircraft is equipped with four emergency e xits, two in the front of the plane and two in the aft. Be sure to identify the n earest exit to you, which may be behind you.

# In a Rut

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 82: In a Rut.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 82. My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educatio nal Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about being in a rut. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Woman: What do you want to do tonight?

Man: I don't know. What do you want to do?

W: I have no idea. Do you think we're in a rut?

M: What do you mean?

W: Well, we do the same things every weekend. We go  to the same restaurants. We see the same friends. You know what I mean?

M: Yeah, I guess you're right. It's easy to get bog ged down in the day-to-day and forget to change things up once in a while. Let's b reak out and do something completely different tonight.

W: Okay, I'll look in the events section of the pap er to see what's going on tonight. Hmm, we could go to a concert. There is a good one tonight. I bet it's not sold out but we'll have to drive an hour to the ven ue.

M: An hour? That's a bit of a bummer. Let me take a  peek and see what else there is. How about going dancing? We haven't done that in a while. There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping o n Friday nights. Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor, and the cover charge isn't bad.

W: I'm not really in the mood for dancing, actually . You know what? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging, after all. How ab out you?

M: Yeah, I was hoping you’d say that. It's nice to have the option to go out but I’d rather stay in. Maybe we can go out tomorrow night.

W: Yeah, definitely tomorrow night.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking in this podcast about “being in a rut .” “To be in a rut” means that you are doing the same thing over and over again un til you get bored. It’s like having the same routine or same things that you do all the time. When you start to get bored with that, we use the expression “in a  rut.” A “rut” (rut) is if, for example, you have a bicycle and the bicycle goes ba ck and forth in the ground. Many bicycles go back and forth.  Eventually, there  will be a path or a line that is formed by the bicycles going back and forth, and so  that when you go in your bicycle, it will fall into that little hole, that l ittle path which we call a “rut.” So, “to be stuck in a rut” or “to be in a rut” means that you are moving in a direction and that you always go in that direction.

The woman says that they go to the same restaurants  and see the same friends. “You know what I mean?” That expression, “you know what I mean,” or sometimes we might just say, “You know?” means “Do you understand?” Though sometimes, we use it just to make sure the other pe rson is listening. The man answers that, “It’s easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day.” “To get bogged down” (bogged), the verb is “to bog down” or “to ge t bogged down,” means that you are slowed down or that you get stuck in a cert ain position. A “bog” (bog) is very wet, muddy ground that if you put something on  it, it will sink, it will go down into it and it’s hard to get it out. So, “to be bog ged down” means that you have these burdens, these problems or these things that keep you from doing something different. The expression, “the day-to-da y” (day) -- “the day-to-day” just means the common ordinary normal things that y ou do every day.

One way of getting out of being “bogged down” is “t o change things up.” “To change things up” – notice this is another two-word  verb, “to change up” – again, it means pretty much the same as to change – to cha nge the way you do things. “Let’s change things up and tonight we are going to  the beach instead of to a movie.” That is the expression we might use. The “u p” doesn’t change the meaning very much. It’s a little more common, howev er, when we say that we’re going to change the way we do something. The man su ggests that they “break out” and do something different. “To break out” – l iterally, if you are in prison, and you want to get out before your time, you have to “ break out” – means you have

to escape. You have to get out. So, the man here is  using this as a metaphor. “To break out” means to get out of, to escape what they’re doing right now.

The woman suggests that they look in the “events se ction” of the paper. The “events section” is the part of a newspaper that ha s the listing of all the movies and the dance clubs and the theater and so forth. S ometimes we call this the “calendar section” because it often has a calendar,  a list date by date of when things will happen. She suggests going to a concert  and says, “I bet it’s not sold out.” “I bet” – “to bet” (bet)  again has a couple of different meanings. One meaning of “to bet” is that you go, for example, to  Las Vegas or to Monte Carlo or someplace where you can gamble, play poker or do ot her sorts of gambling, and you can place a “bet” or simply “bet,” which means you put money down and you hope that you win that particular game. Here, howev er, when we say, “I bet,” what we’re really saying is “I think.” We use the p hrase “bet,” I suppose, because we’re saying, “I could bet; I could put money down and be sure that I was going to win.” More generally though, it simply means “I think” or “in my opinion.” The woman says it’s probably not “sold out.” “To sell o ut,” or “to be sold out” means that there are no more tickets, there’s no more tic kets to the event. She says that it’s going to take an hour to drive to the “venue.”  A “venue” (venue) is a place where a concert or a play is performed. A theater is a type of “venue.” The man doesn’t want to travel for an hour. In fact, he say s, “That’s a bit of a bummer.” A “bummer” (bummer) simply means something that you d on’t like, an unfortunate event. It’s an informal expression, probably used m ore often by younger people. “Boy, that’s a bummer.” It just means that’s a bad thing, that’s an unfortunate thing.

The man says, “Let me take a peek and see what else  there is.” “To take a peek” (peek) means to take a look, usually a quick look. A “peek” is when you look at something very quickly. There’s a game that young c hildren play called “peek-a- boo.” And “peek-a-boo” is when you hide behind some thing – little child will hide behind something then stick their head out and then  put it back so you can’t see it.  That’s kind of like playing “peek-a-boo.” Or y ou put your hand in front of your eyes, you take a quick look, a “peek,” and then you  put your hand back in front of your eyes. The suggestion of the man is that they g o dancing and he points out – or he says to the woman that there’s a “club” in Si lver Lake that’s supposed to be “hopping” on Friday nights. A “club” is a place whe re people dance, in this instance, a “dance club.” “Silver Lake” is just a n eighborhood here in Los Angeles. “To be hopping” means to be very busy, to have lots of excitement. Usually we talk about a “dance club” or a “party” a s being “hopping.” It means there are a lot of people there and there is a lot of excitement there.

The dance club usually has a “DJ.” And “DJ” stands for “Disc Jockey” and that’s the person who plays CD’s nowadays or the records i n the old days. A “dance floor,” of course, is the place in the club where y ou can dance. And the “cover charge” is how much you have to pay to get into a d ance club. That fee, or that price, is called the “cover charge.” Sometimes, peo ple will just say, “the cover.” “How much is the cover for that club?” How much do you have to pay to get in? The woman says that she’s not really “in the mood f or dancing.” “To be in the mood” means that you feel like doing something, tha t you want to do something. She’s not “in the mood.” She wants to stay home and  “veg.” She says, “I’m staying home tonight and vegging.” “To veg” (veg) is an informal verb, means to relax, not to do any sort of thinking or anything t hat would make you have to work. So, someone who is “vegging” is someone who is relaxing but not doing anything intellectual. The man says that he wants to stay home, too. He says, “It’s nice to have the option to go out but I’d rat her stay in.” “To have the option” just means to have the choice. “To go out” and “to stay in” are opposites. “To go out” means to go somewhere like a play or a theater  or a movie theater or a concert, to leave your house and to go somewhere, u sually for entertainment. “To stay in” means to stay at your house. When some one says, “I’m staying in tonight,” they mean I’m not going to leave my house  or my apartment.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Woman: What do you want to do tonight?

Man: I don't know. What do you want to do?

W: I have no idea. Do you think we're in a rut?

M: What do you mean?

W: Well, we do the same things every weekend. We go  to the same restaurants. We see the same friends. You know what I mean?

M: Yeah, I guess you're right. It's easy to get bog ged down in the day-to-day and forget to change things up once in a while. Let's b reak out and do something completely different tonight.

W: Okay, I'll look in the events section of the pap er to see what's going on tonight. Hmm, we could go to a concert. There is a good one tonight. I bet it's not sold out but we'll have to drive an hour to the ven ue.

M: An hour? That's a bit of a bummer. Let me take a  peek and see what else there is. How about going dancing? We haven't done that in a while. There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping o n Friday nights. Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor, and the cover charge isn't bad.

W: I'm not really in the mood for dancing, actually . You know what? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging, after all. How ab out you?

M: Yeah, I was hoping you’d say that. It's nice to have the option to go out but I’d rather stay in. Maybe we can go out tomorrow night.

W: Yeah, definitely tomorrow night.

# Planning a Business Luncheon

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 83: Planning a Business Luncheon.

You’re listening to episode 83 of English as a Seco nd Language Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful – for the most part – Los Angeles, Califo rnia.

Today’s podcast is going to be about planning a bus iness lunch or a business luncheon. Let’s eat!

[start of dialogue]

One of my co-workers, Betty, was retiring this mont h after working for the company 23 years. I was put in charge of planning a  retirement lunch in her honor at a restaurant nearby. The company was picki ng up the tab and it was up to me to set a day and time. After asking the peopl e in the department and finding out their availability, I called the restau rant to make a reservation.

Manager: Bruno's.

Jeff: Hi, I'm calling from Nika Corporation. We wou ld like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant.

Manager: Oh, certainly. I'm Linda, the manager. I can help you with that. How many will there be in your party?

Jeff: There will be about 18 people.

Manager: Okay. For a party that size, we have a sep arate banquet room in the back.

Jeff: Is there an extra charge to reserve the room?

Manager: No, as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests, there is no extra charge.

Jeff: That's great. I'd like to go ahead and reserv e the room, then, for Friday, December 2, at around noon. This is a retirement pa rty and we’d like to bring a

cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of cha mpagne. Will that be acceptable?

Manager: The cake is no problem at all, but we do c harge a corkage fee of $15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the resta urant.

Jeff: Oh, that's fine.

Manager: Great. I have the banquet room reserved for a luncheon for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December. May I have your  name and contact information?

Jeff: Sure. I'm Jeff McQuillan and my number is 323 -555-6840, extension 42.

Manager: Thanks, Mr. McQuillan. I'll give you a cal l a week in advance to confirm the arrangements.

Jeff: Sounds good. Thanks for your help.

Manager: Thank you for choosing Bruno's. We look fo rward to seeing you on the 2nd.

[end of dialogue]

We learn in this podcast about making plans at a re staurant for a business lunch. The expression we use in the title is “luncheon” (l uncheon) and “luncheon” is just another word for lunch but it implies something mor e formal, often for a business reason. The reason for this particular business lun cheon is that one of my co- workers, Betty, was retiring this month. “To retire ” means that you are leaving your job. Usually, you retire when you are, in the United States, 64 or 65 years old. I was “put in charge” of planning a retirement  luncheon. “To be put in charge” means that you are the person who will organize. Yo u are the leader of that particular task, or thing you have to do.

Now, the lunch is in Betty’s honor, “in her honor,”  which means it’s for her. It’s something we’re doing especially for her. We use th at expression, “in your honor” or “in his honor,” to mean that it’s a special even t that we are doing to honor or to thank this person. The company is going to be “pick ing up the tab.” “To pick up the tab” means to pay for. It’s a somewhat informal  expression to pay for. The “tab” (tab) is another word for the bill or the che ck. So, you can ask, for example, “Who’s picking up the tab?” It means, “Who is payin g for this?” Not just in a restaurant but for any sort of project. I said that  it was “up to me” to set a day and

time. The expression, “it is up to you” or “it is u p to me,” means it’s my decision. I’m the one who has to choose. So, for example, if you were saying to your wife or husband, “Do you want to go to a movie or do you  want to go to a play?” and they said to you, “It’s up to you,” or simply, “Up to you,” that would mean they want you to pick. That usually is what happens in m y house.

I said that I had to find out what the “availabilit y” was of the people in my department at work. The “availability” means whethe r they can go on certain time or date. I then called the restaurant to make a “re servation.” A “reservation,” of course, is when you call a restaurant or a hotel or  airline and say, “I want to use your service at a certain time.” The woman answered  the phone with the name of the restaurant, Bruno’s. I told the woman that we wanted to “hold a business lunch” at the restaurant. “To hold a lunch” just me ans to have a lunch. We sometimes use that for events or activities. “Where  is the reception being held?” means, “Where is the reception going to be? What is  the location of the reception or the party?” The woman answering the phone introd uced herself as the manager, or the boss, of the restaurant. And she as ked me, “How many would be in your party? How many will there be in your pa rty?” “Party” here doesn’t mean a celebration. “Party” just means group or the  number of people in your group. So, when someone says, “How many in your par ty?” -- which is a very common question at a restaurant, they’re asking you  how many people are in your group, how big of a table do you need? Now, in  my case I needed 18 seats, or 18 places. I had a big “party.” And so the manag er told me, “Well, for a party that size,” meaning that big, “we have a separate b anquet room in the back.” A “banquet room” in a restaurant is a private room, a  separate room where people can have events and parties and not interfere with the rest of the restaurant, those people who are not in the party. It’s a separ ate room. A “banquet” is just another word for a very formal, very nice meal with  lots of different food.

I asked if there was an “extra charge to reserve the room,” meaning is it going to cost more money. “Charge” is – here, really, refers  to whether they’re going to charge me more money, whether they’re going to tell  me I have to pay more money. The woman said there was no extra charge if I could “guarantee” at least 15 guests. “To guarantee” as a verb means to promis e, to say someone, “Yes, that will happen” or, “I will do that.” A “guarante e” as a noun is a promise that you make to someone. We also use that word, “guarantee, ” for something that you buy, maybe a computer or a television, and they’ll sometimes say, “This is guaranteed,” meaning if there’s something wrong wit h it, we will fix it or take it back. I then make a reservation for the 2nd of Dece mber and I tell the manager that we want to bring a cake for the “guest of hono r.” The “guest of honor” is when you have a dinner, a meal, a lunch and you are  thanking someone or you

are honoring or telling this person that they’ve do ne a good job. The person that you are having the lunch for is called the “guest of honor.”

I also asked if I can bring some bottles of champag ne in the restaurant and the manager says, “Yes, but there’s a corkage fee.” A “ corkage fee” (corkage) – when you have a bottle of wine or champagne, there’ s a little thing at the top of the bottle that is like the cap or the top that kee ps the wine in the bottle.  We call that a “cork.” “Cork” is a type of material and “co rkage fee” means that in this case, they charge you for each bottle of champagne or wine that you bring in that you don’t buy at the restaurant. Some restaurants h ave corkage fees; some restaurants you can’t bring in wine or alcohol even  by paying an extra amount of money. I say to the woman, “That’s fine,” meaning t hat’s okay, I agree. And the woman, the manager, repeats back my information. Sh e gives my telephone number with the “area code” first. In the United St ates, there is – each different region has its own “area code.” I live in “area cod e” 310. There are many “area codes” in Los Angeles depending on where we live. A nd the regular or local telephone number has 7 digits. I also give my “exte nsion,” meaning at my work, if you call that number, you have to dial in or ask for phone number 42, “extension” 42.

The woman tells me that she will call me a week in advance to confirm the arrangements. “In advance” just means before. So, i f I say to you, “Let’s meet in February of next year. I’ll call you a week in adva nce of our meeting,” I mean I’m going to call that person 7 days before we are actu ally going to have our meeting. “Arrangements” just means the agreement, the information that I gave the manager. The “arrangements for something” are the details, the information that you need in order to do what you’re going to d o. We often talk about “arrangements at a restaurant” or “arrangements for  a meeting” – means the person who’s taking or the actual things that you h ave to do in order to have the meeting or the lunch. I say to the manager, “Sounds  good,” meaning that is okay with me, that everything is agreeable to me.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.

# Bargaining with a Seller

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 84: Bargaining with a Seller.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 84. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about bargaining with a seller. Let’s go shopping!

[start of dialogue]

It was Saturday afternoon and I was shopping in the  garment district in downtown L.A. If you want to find good deals on clothes, sho es, and accessories, this is the place to come. To get the best deal, though, you ha ve to be ready to bargain.

I walked by a stall and saw a purse I liked. The ow ner had just finished making a sale.

Lucy: Does this come in any other colors?

Man: Yeah, we have this one in white and blue. I al so have this other style in green.

Lucy: How much is the blue one?

Man: It's $32.

Lucy: $32? What about the green one?

Man: That's $30.

Lucy: That seems a little high. Can you do better o n the price?

Man: This is a designer bag and it's good quality. It's a bargain at that price.

Lucy: Is that your best offer?

Man: That's the best I can do.

Lucy: Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.

Man: Okay, how about $28.

Lucy: That's still more than I wanted to spend. Wha t if I take the blue one and the green one?

Man: I'll give you both of them for $55.

Lucy: That's not much of a break on the price. How about $50 for both?

Man: You drive a hard bargain. The best I can do is  $54. You won't find it cheaper anywhere else.

Lucy: Why don't we split the difference and make it  $52?

Man: Okay, okay. You've got a deal.

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast, we go shopping in the “garment dis trict” in downtown Los Angeles. The “garment district” (garment) – a “garm ent” is a piece of clothing. It’s something you wear. And a garment district is a pla ce, usually, where you can buy clothes cheaper than other places. It’s a place  where factories -- people who make clothing will often sell their clothes directl y to the public. There’s a garment district in Los Angeles, there’s a garment district  in New York City and in many cities throughout the world. This is often the place and a “district” is just a place or a neighborhood where you find a lot of companies  that make clothing. The person in this particular podcast wants to find a “ good deal.” When you say, “I’m looking for a good deal,” you’re saying, “I’m looki ng for a cheap price, a low price, something that’s not expensive,” at least it is les s than what you would normally pay. If you want a good deal, you often have to wai t until there is a sale on what you want to buy when they lower the price.

In this particular example, Lucy is looking for som e clothes, some shoes, and “accessories.” “Accessories” are what women wear in  addition to their dress or their shoes.  That would include earrings or a neck lace around your neck.  Those are accessories. A man can also have “accessories,”  like a watch or a belt and so forth. Lucy is ready to “bargain” in the garment  district. “To bargain,” the verb (bargain), means that you are going to try to get a  lower price than the price that the person selling it wants to give it to you for. And you don’t normally bargain in a regular store in the United States but you can ba rgain at certain places, and the

garment district in Los Angeles or many other place s, there are many people selling different things all next to each other – is a place where you can often bargain. When you go to a market that has lots of d ifferent people selling, usually we talk about each little store as a “stall.” A “st all” (stall) is a small place in a market where someone is selling their goods. You co uld have a “stall” in a grocery market or, in this case, in the garment dis trict market.

The owner, according to Lucy – she went up to one of the stalls and saw a purse she liked. And the owner was finish “making a sale. ” “To make a sale” just means that he was selling something to someone else. The dialogue begins with Lucy asking the seller, “Does this purse come in any oth er colors?” The expression “to come in” here just means “Do you make it?” Do you h ave that particular purse, in this case, in another color or in other colors? You  can say, for example, “This car comes in black, white, and blue,” meaning you can b uy one that’s painted black, painted white, or painted blue. You can talk about the way things “come in” for size as well. You want to buy a shirt and the one t hat you see is too small, you could ask, “Does this come in a large?” In this cas e, Lucy asked the man if this purse comes in any other colors and the seller says , “Yes, we have this one in white and blue.” The expression “to have something in a color” is the same as “it comes in a color.”

Lucy asked the price for the blue one and the man s ays, “It’s $32,” and Lucy says, “That seems a little high.” When you are barg aining with someone, of course, you don’t want to accept the first price th at they give you and so she is indicating here, politely, that this price is too h igh for her. “That seems a little high.” That’s too much. Then she asked the seller, “Can you do better on the price?” This is a very standard question in English  when you are trying to see if the person selling it will lower the price. “Can yo u do better on the price?” “Can you give me a lower price?” is what we’re asking. O f course, the seller doesn’t want to give a lower price and so, here, he tries to justify, or give you a reason, why the price is as it is. This seller says that the purse is a “designer bag and it’s good quality.” The “bag” here (bag), or bag, just r efers to a purse, in this case. A “bag” is anything that you can carry something in t hat is usually a not solid, that is flexible. A “designer bag” or a “designer purse” is  one that’s made by a famous company, designed by a famous designer, someone who  figures out what style should be. Gucci, for example, is a famous Italian designer.

The man selling the purse says that, “It’s a bargai n at any price.” Here, a “bargain” is a noun, not a verb. We know that “to b argain” – means to try to get a lower price. A “bargain” is the same here as a good  deal. If I say, “That’s a bargain” we mean that’s a very good deal. Lucy then  says, “Is that your best offer?” When you ask someone that’s selling somethi ng, “Is that your best offer?”

you’re saying, “Is that the lowest price you can gi ve me?” The man says, “Yes, that’s the best I can do,” meaning that’s the lowes t price. And Lucy says, “Well, I think I’ll shop around.” “To shop around” means to go somewhere else to buy things or to look at things. Of course, what normal ly happens when you start leaving in your bargaining with someone is that the y decide to lower the price to get you to stay, to get you to buy. And so the sell er says, “Oh, how about $28?” And Lucy says, “That’s still more than I wanted to spend.” This is another polite way of saying that the price is still too high. “Th at’s more than I want to pay.” “That’s more than I want to spend.” Lucy then offer s to buy two purses, one green and one blue, and asked the man what the pric e would be and the seller says, “$55.” Lucy then responds, “That’s not much of a break on the price.” When we say that there is a “break (break) on the price, ” we mean that it’s a discount, that it is a lower price. We say sometimes also, “G ive me a break on this price” – means give me a lower price, take some of the money  off of the price.

Lucy then offers $50 and the man responds by saying , “You drive a hard bargain.” This is kind of a common expression for s omeone who likes to bargain a lot and try to get the absolute lowest price. “Yo u drive a hard bargain” means that you are trying to get a much lower price than I want to give. The man then says, “The best I can do is $54.” “The best I can d o” means this is the lowest price I can give you. It’s like the best offer. Fin ally Lucy uses a good bargaining strategy. Lucy wants to pay $50. The man wants to c harge her $54. So, Lucy says, “Why don’t we split the difference and make it $52?” “To split the difference” means that we are going to take the pri ce right in the middle. So, 50, 54, “to split the difference” would be $52. Finally  the man says, “Okay, okay. You’ve got a deal.” Here the word “deal” means that  I agree to do it, you have a sale. “You’ve got a deal.” It’s saying, “Okay, I wi ll sell that to you at that price.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

# The Blind Date

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 85: The Blind Date.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 85. My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educatio nal Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On today’s podcast, we’re going to learn about two people who don’t know each other, going on a blind date. Let’s go! > I broke up with my boyfriend last month. We had gon e out for a year and I was ready to settle down but I could tell that he still  wanted to play the field before getting married. I don't think Don ever cheated on me, but I finally realized that he wasn't the marrying type.

> Today, we go on a “blind date.” A “date” is what tw o people who are romantically interested in do, such as going out to dinner or go ing to see a movie. A “blind date” is when the two people don’t know each other and they’ve never seen each other before. Hence, therefore, we call it a “blind  date.” “Blind,” meaning, of course, if you can’t see. The woman in the story sa ys that she “broke up” with her boyfriend last month. “To break up with someone” is  that when you end a relationship, a romantic relationship, between a bo yfriend and a girlfriend, for example. It can be both a noun and a verb. You can say, “I’m breaking up with you,” meaning, “I’m not going to see you anymore ro mantically,” or you can say, “He had a very difficult break up,” a “break up” me aning the event of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

Lucy mentions that she and her boyfriend had “gone out” for a year and she was ready to “settle down.” “To go out,” in this case, means to see someone in a romantic way.  For example, two people, a boyfriend  and a girlfriend, if they’re “going out,” that means that they’re in a relations hip. So, you may say to someone, “Are you going out with anyone right now?”  You don’t mean that you are leaving your house. You mean, “Are you in a rel ationship with someone?” Usually, we say this before someone gets married. A fter that, you can’t go out anymore. Well, you’re not supposed to.  Anyway, Luc y said she wants to “settle down.” “To settle down,” here, means “to get marrie d,” so when a woman or a man says, “I want to settle down,” they mean, “I wa nt to get married.” “Settle down,” two words, as a verb also means to be calm, to be relaxed. If you say to a young child, “Settle down,” you mean, “Don’t be so excited.”

Lucy mentioned that her boyfriend, Don, still wante d to “play the field” before getting married. “To play the field” means that you  want to date or go out on dates with other people, that you want to see diffe rent people before you go on a – before you get married or settle down. “To see ot her people,” here, means that you are, again, in a romantic relationship. Lucy sa ys she doesn’t think Don ever “cheated on” her but that he wasn’t the “marrying t ype.” “To cheat on someone” in a romantic relationship means that you see someo ne else, you go out on a date with someone else while you’re still in the re lationship with the other person. So, you have a girlfriend and you meet another girl  at a party and you decide to go on a date with her. Or if you’re married and you r husband is away on a

business trip and you decide to date or see or get romantically involved with the mailman, that would be cheating on our husband.  No w, that’s why you shouldn’t go on very long trips.

Lucy said that her friend or her boyfriend, Don, wa sn’t the “marrying type.” “The marrying type” just means someone who’s willing or interested in getting married someday. Her friend, Sheila, was “thrilled” to hear  that the two of them had “split up.” “To be thrilled” means to be very excited, to be very happy. Someone says, “I’m thrilled you came to dinner,” they mean, “I’m very happy you came to dinner.” “To split up” is the same as to break up. Brad Pitt and Jennifer Anniston “split up.”  That means they separated.  And that c ould be true for a boyfriend or girlfriend; it could be true for a husband and wife . Her friend Sheila wants to “set her up” with some of her single friends. “To set so meone up with someone else” means that you are going to arrange for those peopl e to meet each other and to go out on a date. This can be very painful sometime s if you don’t like the person they set you up with. This sort of date is called a  “blind date” because you don’t get to see or meet the other person before you go o ut to dinner or see a movie. Sheila tells Lucy that her friend, Alan, is her “so ul mate” and that he would be her “Mr. Right.” A “soul mate” (soul) soul, is someone who thinks like you, who has the same opinions, someone who is so close to you t hat they are like your own soul, your own force that keeps you alive. To say y ou are going to be someone’s “Mr. Right” is an expression that girls and women u se to describe their ideal husband, the perfect husband, or simply, the person  that they are going to marry someday. “You are Mr. Right” for that person. We do n’t say “Ms. Right” or “Mrs. Right” but we do say “Mr. Right.”

Sheila says this friend of hers, Alan, is “good-loo king,” has a “good sense of humor” he’s “bright,” he’s “witty,” he’s “kind” and  he’s “considerate.” Now, she’s not talking about me. “Good-looking” is someone who  is very attractive, someone that other people will find physically attractive. A “good sense of humor” means they can laugh, they can tell a joke, they like to laugh. “To be bright” here means to be intelligent. We say, “He’s a very bright guy, ” we mean he’s a very smart guy. “To be witty” (witty) means that you say cleve r things, that you can think of a funny or interesting way to say something.  That’s to be “witty.” “To be kind,” of course, is to be nice. And “to be considerate” is to be thinking of other people, to consider the feelings and thoughts of other people.  Lucy said that “in the end,” she told Sheila to give him her number. “In the end ,” here, means at the conclusion, she finally decided after some time, to  tell Sheila to give her Alan’s number. “Her number,” here, or rather, “Alan’s numb er,” means his telephone number. We sometimes just say, “Give me your number .” We mean, “give me your telephone number.”

So, Alan and Lucy decide to meet at a café and she describes him, Alan, as “a nice-looking guy sitting by himself near the window .” “Nice-looking” is the same as good-looking, attractive, physically attractive.  Lucy and Alan introduce each other. “Hi, are you Alan?” “Yes, you must be Lucy.”  “You must be Lucy” is what you would say to someone that you haven’t met befor e but you know that that’s the right person. “So, you must be John,” meaning I  know you’re John even if I’ve never met you. You wouldn’t say that to someone who  you know already. Lucy says that Sheila likes to play “matchmaker.” A “mat chmaker,” all one word (matchmaker), is someone who likes to set people up  with other people, that is, likes to match people who they know and get them to  go on dates and be romantically interested in each other.

Alan says, “To tell the truth, I’m not big on blind  dates.” The expression, “to tell the truth,”  we use when we’re going to tell someon e something that is very honest, that might be a little bit too much. So, we ’re saying, “Well, to tell the truth, I don’t like this movie.” It’s often with something  that’s negative but not always. Alan says he’s not “big on blind dates.” When you s ay, “I’m big on something,” you mean you really like that thing. “I’m big on wa tching football on Sunday. I really like to do it.” The opposite is to be “not b ig on something.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of story]

I broke up with my boyfriend last month. We had gon e out for a year and I was ready to settle down but I could tell that he still  wanted to play the field before getting married. I don't think Don ever cheated on me, but I finally realized that he wasn't the marrying type.

My friend Sheila was thrilled to hear that we had s plit up. She never liked Don and she was anxious to set me up with some of her s ingle friends. I told her that I didn't want to go on any blind dates but she kept t elling me about this guy, Alan. She thought he was my soul mate and she was sure th at he would be my Mr. Right. According to Sheila, he was good-looking, he  had a good sense of humor, he was bright and witty, and was kind and considera te. In the end, I told Sheila to give him my number. He called and we agreed to meet  for coffee.

I walked into the café and looked around. I saw a n ice-looking guy sitting by himself near the window.

Lucy: Hi. Are you Alan?

Alan: Yeah. You must be Lucy.

Lucy: Did you have trouble finding the café?

Alan: No, I've actually been here before. I'm reall y glad you could make it. Sheila has been telling me all about you.

Lucy: Well, Sheila likes to play matchmaker. But it 's nice to meet you, too.

Alan: To tell the truth, I'm not big on blind dates .

Lucy: Yeah, me neither but I'm glad I came.

Alan: Yes, so am I.

# Asking About Jobs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 86: Asking About Jobs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 86. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Be sure to visit our website a t www.eslpod.com.

Today’s podcast is about asking someone politely ab out their job. Let’s go!

[start of dialogue]

I was at the store the other day. I saw a former co -worker, Michael, across the room. He used to work at my company until he quit a  few months ago to start a new job as a public relations officer at Missouri U niversity. It's a job he's been working toward for years. He wasn't happy working f or a corporation and wanted to get into either a non- profit organization or a university. I wanted to see how he was doing. The truth was, I was thinking of making a move myself.

Becky: Hey, Michael. Remember me? I'm Becky. We use d to work at Lekmans together.

Michael: Oh, sure. How are you? Long time, no see. How are things at Lekmans?

Becky: It's about the same. I've been thinking of m aking a change myself. Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university?

Michael: No, not at all. Go ahead.

Becky: Well, I was wondering what the salaries are like. I mean, are they much lower than the corporate world?

Michael: Well, I can't speak for all universities, but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lekmans. I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation.

Becky: Yeah, that's what I thought, but I've heard that the perks are better. I was wondering if that was really true.

Michael: I'd have to say yes and no on that. I don' t get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lekmans but I get to take class es for free if I want to. I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm takin g classes now to do that.

Becky: Oh, that's great. It sounds like you're real ly happy with your move.

Michael: Yeah, I guess I am. Working at a universit y really suits me.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking about asking someone politely about their job in this podcast. That’s always a sensitive subject, that is, some pe ople don’t like answering questions about their job so you want to do that ve ry politely and there are several expressions that we use in relation or rela ted to this topic. Let’s begin at the beginning of the story. The woman in the story,  Becky, says that she was in the store “the other day.” That expression “the oth er day” means the same here as “recently.” It could have been yesterday, maybe last week. She said she saw a “former co-worker” of hers. “Former” (former) mea ns, here, a “ex-co-worker,” someone who used to be a co-worker but isn’t any lo nger. We talk about former presidents and former movie stars, people who used to be but aren’t anymore. This former co-worker of hers, Michael, is now work ing as a “public relations officer” for a university. A “public relations offi cer” is someone who deals with or handles the media or the press for a company. “Publ ic relations,” in general, is making sure that your company or your business has a good image, that people get accurate information about you.

Becky says that it’s a job he’s been “working towar d” for years. To say you are “working towards something” means that that is your  goal, that you are trying to accomplish that goal. He said that he wanted to get  in to either a “non-profit” organization or a university. A “non-profit” organi zation is one that doesn’t try to make money but tries to help other people. It still  has to have money, of course, but it’s not a regular business in that sense. Beck y then says, “The truth was, I was thinking of making a move myself.” The expressi on “the truth was” or “the truth was that” is just a way of introducing some s tatement or some idea that indicates that you are going to be very honest with  the person. “To make a move,” here, means to leave your job and to go to a  different company. Then in the conversation, Becky says, “Hey Michael. Remembe r me?” and Michael says, “Oh, sure. Long time, no see.” That expression, “Lo ng time, no see,” is one we use for someone, of course, that we haven’t seen in  a long time. We could say, “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you,” but we  usually use that short expression, “Long time, no see.” It’s a very unusua l expression because there’s no subject in the sentence. We don’t say, “Long tim e, I have not seen you,” so

I’m not sure quite why we use that. That’s one of the few cases where you’ll see that particular form or construction of the sentenc e, “Long time, no see.”

Becky then says to Michael that she was thinking of  “making a change” herself, making a move, changing jobs, and then she introduc es a polite way of asking a question, “Do you mind if I ask you a few things ab out your job?” That expression “Do you mind if” followed by the question, “Do you mind if I ask you where you bought those shoes?” That is a polite way of introd ucing a question. Michael responds by saying, “No, not at all,” meaning, “I d on’t mind.” The response to the affirmative or positive or “yes” response to the qu estion, “Do you mind?” is “No, not at all,” or “No, I don’t mind,” meaning it does n’t bother me. When you say, “Do you mind?” you’re asking, “does it bother you? Is it okay that I ask you this question?” We can also use this as a polite way of requesting something from someone. “Do you mind moving over to the left so I can see the movie screen?” For example, you’re sitting in a theater and someon e has a big hat sitting right in front of you. I should add that if you say “Yes” to  the question, “Do you mind?” “Yes, I mind,” that’s considered rather rude to say  “Yes” to that question. Even though you might want to. Maybe it does bother you but you have to know someone pretty well to answer “Yes” to the question . “Do you mind if I take all of your money?” Then, you might want to say, “Yes, I m ind.”

But Michael doesn’t mind and he says, “Go ahead,” m eaning, “Ask your question.”  “Go ahead.” And Becky says, “Well, I wa s wondering what the salaries are like.” This is another case where you ask the question politely by putting another expression in front, “I was wonderi ng.” “To wonder” means “I was thinking about,” meaning “I have a question. I’m no t sure. I was wondering.” This is an embedded question, which means that the subje ct and the verb are reversed as they would be from a normal question. F or example, if you wanted to ask someone a question, “What are the salaries like ?” You notice that “are” comes first, the verb, and then “the salaries,” the  subject, comes second. But if the question is inside another sentence, then we sw itch the subject in the verb to normal order. “I was wondering what the salaries are like.” This is a very common expression, “I was wondering.” Michael says, in res ponse, “Well, I can’t speak for all universities but my salary is definitely lower. ” That expression “I can’t speak for everyone,” meaning, “my views or my opinions do n’t represent everyone but,” and then you give what your opinion is.

In this case, he says that the salaries are “compar able.” I’m sorry, he says the salaries are “not comparable” at the university ver sus a major corporation and this is something I can say is definitely true, hav ing worked at a university. The “salaries,” or the amount that you get paid is “not  comparable,” meaning it’s not the same. You can’t compare one with the other. The y’re not equal. Becky then

asks about the “perks” at Michael’s job. “Perks” (p erks), or “perk” – a “perk” is a benefit. It’s usually a word we use associated with  a job. “This job has lots of perks. I get to travel twice a year. I get a free B lackberry or Palm Treo or, you know, a new cell phone every six months.”  Those wo uld be perks. They’re not part of your regular salary but they are benefits t hat a company or organization gives you. Becky then uses the expression “I was wo ndering.” “I was wondering if that was really true.” Again, a polite way of askin g, “Is that true?” And Michel says, “I have to say, yes and no.” That expression,  of course, is when you want to answer a question both ways. It’s partly true; it’s partly not true. So, someone says, “Are you going to the store today?” And you s ay, “Yes and no.  Yes, I’m going to the store but no, I can’t buy you anything .”

At the end of the dialogue, Michael says that worki ng at a university “really suits” him. When we say something “suits” you (suits), we mean it’s a good fit for you. It’s something that is a good match for you. And yo u can say that about a job, but you could also say it about the color of your hair.  You dye your hair green and you say, “Oh that green really suits you.” I wouldn ’t do that but, you know, some people might. So, when something suits you, it’s ap propriate for you. It’s good for you. Of course, the word, “suit” (suit), has other meanings in English. A “suit” is also what a man or a woman wears, a formal “busines s suit” with a jacket and a tie and pants, and a “suit” is also a legal term. W hen you sue someone (sue), the noun is a “suit” and that is a legal action you tak e against someone else. For example, someone hits your car and they don’t want to pay for the damage, you can “sue” them. You can file a “suit” against them so that the court will make them pay. Well, we won’t make you pay, but we will give you the dialogue again, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I was at the store the other day. I saw a former co -worker, Michael, across the room. He used to work at my company until he quit a  few months ago to start a new job as a public relations officer at Missouri U niversity. It's a job he's been working toward for years.

# Hotel Housekeeping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 87: Hotel Housekeeping.

You are listening to English as a Second Language P odcast episode 87.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about staying in a h otel room and getting services from housekeeping.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I’m so glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out  to be a dump.  The last time I went on vacation, I booked it online sight unseen, and it turned out to be a run down motel.  This hotel was completely different.  The décor was tasteful and updated, the staff was friendly, and the rooms were  well-maintained.

Well, that is, until my second day there.  When I l eft my room in the morning, I had removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping would know I needed my room made up.  When I got back in the afternoon, though, it hadn’t been done properly.  The maid had made the b ed, cleaned the bathroom, and re-stocked the mini-bar, but she hadn’t vacuume d the carpet and didn’t leave any soap or clean towels.  I called down to the fro nt desk to make a complaint.

“Front desk.  How may I help you?”

“Hello.  I’m in room 1201 and housekeeping didn’t l eave any soap or clean towels.  And, the floor still needs to be vacuumed. ”

“Oh, I’m so sorry.  Let me connect you with houseke eping.”  I waited on hold.

“Housekeeping.”

“Yes, this is room 1201.  The maid who cleaned my r oom didn’t leave any soap or clean towels, and the floor needs vacuuming.”

“Okay.  I’ll get someone up there right away to tak e care of that.”

About 10 minutes later, the maid knocked on the doo r.  I stepped out of the room and she left the toiletries in the bathroom and vac uumed.   That was pretty quick service.  I’m glad I didn’t get the run-around.

[end of dialogue]

Today we are traveling and staying at a hotel.  I b egin the story by talking about how I was glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out to be a dump.  The verb “to book” (book) has nothing to do with books that you read, it’s another word for a reservation or to reserve.  So, “I reserved a room”  is the same as “I booked a room.”  We tend to use that verb particularly for h otels, but you can also say “I booked a flight to New York,” meaning I bought an a irplane ticket.  I said that the hotel didn’t turn out to be a dump.  “To turn out” means it didn’t result in, it didn’t end up.  “End up” “turn out” are two verbs that mea n in this case pretty much the same thing, that the final result wasn’t.  The hote l, I said, wasn’t a “dump” (dump).  That’s a…again, a very particular expressi on – special expression we use for a house or a hotel or some building that is  not very clean, that isn’t very well managed or organized – not very clean, that wo uld be a dump.  A “dump” is also a place where you put garbage and trash.  Ever y city has a city dump where the trash and garbage that is collected is put, and  that’s where the expression comes from: it’s a ugly, dirty place.

I said that I booked my vacation hotel online sight  unseen.  The expression “sight (sight) unseen (unseen)” means that I didn’t look a t it, that I didn’t have a chance to physically go there and see what it was like bef ore I booked it.  So if I’m going to travel to another city, such as San Francisco, a nd I book a hotel room, and I’ve never seen the hotel, well then, I’m booking it sig ht unseen.  I said that the hotel I booked for my vacation turned out to be a run down motel.  To be “run down” means that it’s old, it needs repairs, there are ma ny things that are broken or dirty.  You can have a run down hotel.  You could h ave a run down car, an old car doesn’t look very nice.  A “motel” (motel) is s imilar to a hotel (hotel), but usually a motel is smaller.  It comes from the expr ession “motor hotel,” I believe. It’s a hotel that usually is for people who are sta ying a short amount of time, not very luxurious, not a nice place, but often a clean  place, not necessarily a run down place.  That’s a motel.  I said that the “déco r” (décor), which is, I’m sure, a French word.  In English, it means the decorations,  how it looks.  “The staff,” I said, “was friendly (the “staff” are all the people  that work at the hotel, the employees) and the rooms were well-maintained,” mea ning they were clean and they didn’t need repairs and so forth.

Well, I then said that on my second day in the hote l I removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping wou ld know I needed my room

made up.  Couple of expressions there: “Do Not Dist urb,” that’s the sign the hotel gives you to put outside your door so that in the m orning the “maid,” the person who cleans the room, doesn’t knock on your door or come into your…your hotel room if you’re still sleeping for example.  I like to sleep late, especially when I’m on vacation, so I always put the “Do Not Disturb.”  “To disturb” means to bother, so you’re saying don’t bother me, don’t wake me up.   I use the term “housekeeping,” and “housekeeping,” of course you p robably know, is the word that we give to the department in a hotel that clea ns and makes the beds, changes the sheets and the towels, and so forth.  T hat’s all one word: “housekeeping.”  “To keep house” as a verb would me an to make sure everything is clean and organized and so forth.

I said I needed my room made up.  That two-word ver b, “made up,” here means, for a hotel, that it needs to be cleaned, that the bed sheets need to be changed, that new towels need to be put in the bathroom.  Th is is to make up a room.  My room needed to be made up.  Now, “made up” can also  mean invented, like “I made up a story” means I invented a story, I create d a story that isn’t true.  But here, it’s a…as a verb it means to clean and so for th in a hotel room.

The maid made my bed.  “Maid” (maid) is, as we said  before, the person that cleans the room, and “to make the bed” means to put  new sheets on, and to make sure the sheets are tight, and that it’s…the b ed looks nice.  That’s to make the bed.  So the maid had made (“make” in the past tense is “made”) the bed. She re-stocked the mini-bar.  The “mini-bar” is my favorite part of the hotel room; it’s that little refrigerator and there are usually  in American hotels little bottles of alcohol, which you can buy.  They’re not free; they ’ll charge you for them when you leave the hotel – when you check out of the hot el.  That’s called a mini-bar, and “to stock,” or “to re-stock” means to put thing s in there.  So if they re-stock the mini-bar, that means that I took some things ou t – I drank some things, and now they’re putting new ones back in.  Mini-bars ha ve things other than alcohol; they have soda pop, like Coke and Pepsi, that sort of thing as well.  The maid had not vacuumed the carpet.  “To vacuum,” of cours e, is to take a machine, which is called a vacuum that lifts the dirt up fro m a carpet.  And, so therefore I called the front desk to make a complaint.  The “fr ont desk” is sometimes called “reception,” and that’s the place where when you fi rst walk into the hotel you check in, and where you check out of the hotel.  In  some countries it’s common for you to leave your key to your room when you lea ve the hotel, and to pick the key back up when you come back.  But in American ho tels, that’s very…that’s not the way it is done.  They give you a key, usual ly an electronic key like a credit card, and that is your key.  You don’t get a physic al key to your hotel room that you leave at the front desk.

I called down and I told the housekeeping – I asked  for housekeeping, and the person at the front desk said, “Let me connect you, ” in other words, let me connect you to that telephone that you need speak t o, or the person you need to speak to.  And when housekeeping answered the phone , I said, “Yes, this is room 1201.”  In other words, I am on the 12 th  floor of the hotel.  Notice that we don’t same room one thousand two hundred and one, o r we don’t say room one two zero one, although you could say that.  It’s mu ch more common to say twelve zero one, or even more common in the United States: twelve oh one.  We, of course use, oh and zero to mean the same thing m any times.  And I complain, of course, about my room, and about 10 minutes late r, the maid comes up and knocks on my door.  And then I said I stepped out of the room.  “To step out of the room” means I left the room.  Sometimes that ex pression, “to step out,” means to go somewhere, to leave to somewhere.  “I’m  going to step out for a few minutes” means I’m going to leave and be back in a few minutes.  The maid left the toiletries in the bathroom.  The word “toiletri es” comes, of course, from “toilet,” or the bathroom or the restroom, but thos e are all the things that you might use in a bathroom, like mouthwash or shampoo or things for your hair like conditioner.  Those are all toiletries.

At the end of the story, I said I was glad I didn’t  get the run-around.  “To get the run-around,” and “run-around is normally hyphenated  (run-around). “To get the run-around” means that you are not getting a straig ht or an honest answer from people, or that they are not doing what they are su pposed to do to help you.  So for example you go to a store and you complain that  the – I don’t know – the iPod Nano is scratching, and they say, “Well, no, that’s  not really a problem.  It’s…it’s okay…well, you know,” that is getting the run-aroun d, when they’re not giving you what you expect.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, and this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I’m so glad that the hotel I booked didn’t turn out  to be a dump.  The last time I went on vacation, I booked it online sight unseen, and it turned out to be a run down motel.  This hotel was completely different.  The décor was tasteful and updated, the staff was friendly, and the rooms were  well-maintained.

Well, that is, until my second day there.  When I l eft my room in the morning, I had removed the “Do Not Disturb” sign from my door so that housekeeping would know I needed my room made up.  When I got back in the afternoon, though, it hadn’t been done properly.  The maid had made the b ed, cleaned the bathroom,

and re-stocked the mini-bar, but she hadn’t vacuume d the carpet and didn’t leave any soap or clean towels.  I called down to the fro nt desk to make a complaint.

“Front desk.  How may I help you?”

“Hello.  I’m in room 1201 and housekeeping didn’t l eave any soap or clean towels.  And, the floor still needs to be vacuumed. ”

“Oh, I’m so sorry.  Let me connect you with houseke eping.”  I waited on hold.

“Housekeeping.”

“Yes, this is room 1201.  The maid who cleaned my r oom didn’t leave any soap or clean towels, and the floor needs vacuuming.”

“Okay.  I’ll get someone up there right away to tak e care of that.”

About 10 minutes later, the maid knocked on the doo r.  I stepped out of the room and she left the toiletries in the bathroom and vac uumed.   That was pretty quick service.  I’m glad I didn’t get the run-around.

# Socializing at a Reception

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 88: Socializing at a Reception.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  88. I’m Dr. Jeff McQuillan, your host, from the Center for Education al Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this podcast, we’re going to talk about what you  do when you got a reception or a party after a conference or formal meeting. Le t’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Man: Hi. It's a bit crowded in here.

Woman: Yes, it's always like this on the first nigh t of the conference. Is this your first time attending?

Man: Yes, it is. By the way, I'm Dan Morimoto.

Woman: I'm Gwen Renault. Were you here this morning  for the opening keynote? I thought the speaker was excellent.

Man: No, unfortunately, I didn't arrive to the venu e until late morning. Luckily, I pre- registered and just had to pick up my registra tion packet, so I was able to catch the luncheon speaker and she was very good.

Woman: You know, I attended a really interesting se ssion this afternoon on ethics in the profession. It was a panel discussion  and there was some lively debate. The luncheon speaker, Stephanie Morse, pres ented some of her findings from her new ground- breaking study.

Man: I'm sorry I missed it. It sounds interesting. Do you plan on staying for the duration of the conference?

Woman: No, I'm afraid I have to leave early tomorro w. Will you excuse me? I see a colleague of mine over there and I'd like to say hello.

Man: Oh, sure. It was nice meeting you.

Woman: Yes, you, too.

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast we hear two people who are “sociali zing” at a conference reception. “To socialize” means to talk to other pe ople, to have conversations with other people, often people that you work with or people that are in the same line of work, the same type of work, but you can so cialize, really, with anyone. It just means talking, being friendly, having conversa tions with people. We often use that verb “to socialize” when we’re talking abo ut a party or a reception. A “reception” is really the same as a party but it is n’t quite as, perhaps, active. When you say you’re going to have a “reception,” th at often means, in a professional sense, that there may be some food. Th ere may be some drinks but there’s probably not going to be any dancing, at le ast not at most business receptions or conference receptions. We also use the word, however, for a wedding. When someone gets married, the party that you have at the wedding is called the “wedding reception,” and there, of cours e, there might be a lot of dancing and a lot of drinking and well, you know wh at happens.

The man in this particular conversation introduces himself or says something to the woman next to him. He says, “Hi. It’s a bit cro wded in here.” “To be crowded” means that there are too many people and that there ’s so many people, you can’t move easily. The woman responds by saying, “Yes, it ’s always like this on the first night of the conference,” and then asked the man if this was his first time attending. “To attend a conference” means to go to a conference, to be part of the conference. The man says, “Yes it is.,” and the n he says, “By the way, I’m Dan Morimoto,” introduces himself. The expression “ By the way” is often one that we would use in this particular circumstance. When you start talking to someone that you don’t know and you decide that you want to  tell that person your name. You may say, “Oh, and by the way, I’m Jeff,” and, of course, the person, you hope, will give you his or her name.

This woman says, “I’m Gwen Renault,” and then asked  Dan if he was here this morning for the opening “keynote.” A “keynote” (key note) is a speech that someone gives to a large group of people at a confe rence, like either a business conference or an academic conference. It’s one of the main speakers where everyone comes together in a big auditorium or a bi g, what we might call, a conference “hall” (hall), which is a large space wh ere people can listen to a speaker. And in fact, the woman refers to – Gwen re fers to  the opening “keynote” or the opening “keynote address,” which is the same as a speech. She says that she “thought the speaker was excellent.” Of course, the “speaker” is the person who gave the keynote address, who gave the s peech.

 The man says he hadn’t seen the keynote because he didn’t arrive to the “venue” until late morning. The “venue” (venue), here, just  means the place where they’re having the meeting or the conference. The man says that he’s “pre-registered” and just had to pick up his “registration packet.” “To be pre-registered” (pre) – (registered) means that you sent in your money in a dvance. You’ve already registered for the conference or for the meeting an d a “registration packet” is when you go to a conference or a meeting, they’ll u sually give you some information, sometimes a bag that has the schedule of when all the meetings are. This would be part of your “registration packet.”

The man said that he was able to “catch the luncheo n speaker” and thought she was very good. The “luncheon speaker” is the person  who speaks at a lunch. “Lunch” and “luncheon” are pretty much the same. “L uncheon” is usually a word we use for a little more formal meal at lunch time.  The expression “to catch the luncheon speaker” just means that – “to see” or “to  listen to.” You might say to someone, “Did you catch that movie last night on TV ?” That means, “Did you watch that movie?” So, we use that expression a lot , “to catch,” when we’re talking about a show or a presentation, for example .

The woman said that she attended a really interesti ng “session” this afternoon. At a conference or at a meeting, “to have a session” m eans to have a smaller presentation. So, you have -- for example, in the m orning, you might have a keynote address where everyone comes together in on e big room, one big auditorium and then you have various “sessions,” an d the “sessions” are smaller presentations. You may have 5 or 10 or 20 presentat ions and each one of those has a “session” and you get to pick, usually, which  “session” you want to attend, you want to go to. She went to a session or a prese ntation on “ethics in the profession.” “Ethics” (ethics) is what’s right and what’s wrong, so we talked about what’s right and what’s wrong. So, we talk about, “ It’s a problem of ethics.” We’re saying, “What are the right things to do and what are the wrong things to do in terms of the morality or the weather it’s a g ood or bad thing?” For example, honesty should be part of the “ethics” in every pro fession.

The woman goes to a “panel discussion.” A “panel di scussion” is when you have two, three, or more people, usually sitting up at a  table in the front of the room. We call that a “panel” and those people are each go ing to have a chance to talk about a certain subject. The woman said there was a  “lively debate at the panel,” meaning that people were arguing, disagreeing, not necessarily being rude or impolite. You can have a “friendly debate.” The lun cheon speaker who was at the panel discussion presented some of her “key finding s from a new ground- breaking study.” When someone does a research study  or any sort of

investigation or report, the answers they get, or the conclusions that they have or they reach are called their “findings.” It’s what they found. It’s what they discovered. And it’s a noun. “Findings” is a noun. It can also be singular. One of the findings – one finding, I should say – that’s a lso possible. A “study,” you know already, is an investigation into something, often something that is presented at a conference or published in a magazine – scientific magazine. When we say something is “ground-breaking,” that’s a hyphenated  word, “ground” – “breaking,” we mean that it is something new, something that is  a whole new area of research. “Ground-breaking” is what we do when we a re going to build a house or a building. You have to break the ground. You ha ve to dig a hole in the ground and the very first hole, if you will, that you dig is often – there’s a ceremony around it. “We’re going to be a having a ground-bre aking for our new library.” And everybody comes and they have a shovel and the president or whoever is the leader, will take the shovel and put it in the ground and throw some dirt. Of course, they don’t continue working. The president doesn’t build the building, but it’s the beginning, the ceremonial beginning of the  building. So, “ground- breaking” is the first, or it’s something that you do when you start something. And as an adjective, it’s used here to mean something t hat is new, something that is one of the first of its kind.

The man asked the woman if she is going to be stayi ng for the duration of the conference. The “duration” just means for the rest of or until the end of the conference. The woman says “no” and then she says, “Will you excuse me?” meaning I want to do something else.  In this case,  she wants to talk to someone else. So, when you say to someone, “Will you excuse  me?” what you are saying to them is, “I need to leave now. I need to stop ta lking to you,” but it’s a polite way of doing that. The man says, “Oh, sure. It was nice meeting you,” or, “It was nice to meet you.” It’s the same meaning. And the w oman says, “Yes, you too,” meaning, “Yes, it was nice to meet you too.”

Now let’s listen to the conversation this time at n ative rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Man: Hi. It's a bit crowded in here.

Woman: Yes, it's always like this on the first nigh t of the conference. Is this your first time attending?

Man: Yes, it is. By the way, I'm Dan Morimoto.

Woman: I'm Gwen Renault. Were you here this morning  for the opening keynote? I thought the speaker was excellent.

# A Good Listener

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 89: A Good Listener.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 89. I’m Dr. Jeff McQuillan, your host, from the Center for Education al Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about ways of listening politely to someone else. We’ll listen to a conversation. Here we go!

[start of dialogue]

Woman: Hi. Long time no see. How have you been?

Man: Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some troubl e with my son.

Woman: Tell me all about it.

Man: Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's b ecome quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think  he’s running around with the wrong crowd.

Woman: Oh, I see. What makes you think that?

Man: Well, he's become friends with a couple of old er boys who are in a band and one night last weekend, he came home really lat e, way past his curfew.

Woman: Really? What happened?

Man: He told me that his friend's car broke down an d they had to walk home.

Woman: I see what you mean. I understand why you're  concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?

Man: I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.

Woman: You may be right, but it doesn't hurt to fin d out more about what's going on in his life.

Man: You're right. I should talk to him. Sometimes,  it's not easy being a parent. Thanks. It helps to get it off my chest. You're alw ays so easy to talk to.

Woman: I don't know about that, but my door is alwa ys open. Stop by anytime.

[end of dialogue]

We listened to two co-workers, two people who work together, having a conversation and the conversation begins by the wom an saying, “Hi. Long time, no see.” “Long time, no see” means, “I haven’t seen  you in a long time.” And she asks the man, “How have you been?” meaning, “How ha ve you been feeling? How are you doing?” And the man says, “I’ve been fi ne, but I have some trouble with my son.” The woman then says, “Tell me all abo ut it.” This is an expression we use when someone – you want someone to tell you all of the details. It’s a polite way of inviting the person to share their st ory or their problem. In this case, the man has a problem with his 14-year-old son. Who  doesn’t have a problem with a 14-year-old son? And he says the son is a bi t “secretive.” “To be secretive,” you can guess, means to keep secrets, to not tell other people, to keep things to yourself. The boy is also, according  to his father, “running around with the wrong crowd.” “To run around with” doesn’t  here mean physically that he’s running on a race track. “To run around” means  that he is associating with, he’s hanging around, he’s in the company of other p eople, so that particular expression, “running around,” usually means that he  has friends that are not very good for him. The “wrong crowd” is an expression, m eaning people that are going to cause you more problems, that are going to  be a bad influence on you. “He’s running around with the wrong crowd.” Of cour se, “crowd” also means a large group of people but here it means the friends  or the people that his son has become friends with.

The woman then says, “Oh, I see,” which, of course,  is a common way of indicating to the person you’re talking to that you ’re listening. “Oh, I see. What makes you think that?” she asks the man. In other w ords, “Why do you think that?” “What makes you think that?” means, “Why do you have that opinion?” And the man says that he’s becoming – his son has b ecome friends with some older boys who are in a “band.” A “band” of course,  would be like a rock band, and that’s trouble, right? Then the man says that h e came home very late, way past his “curfew.” “Curfew” (curfew), here, means the time in which someone is supposed to be back home. So, a teenager might say,  “I have a 10 o’clock curfew.” That means, “I have to be home by 10 o’clo ck.” The woman says, “Really? What happened?” Again, those are ways of i ndicating that you’re listening. “Oh, really?” And she asks for more info rmation because she’s a good listener, I guess.

 Well, the man says that his son’s friend’s car “bro ke down” and they had to walk home. “To break down,” here, means that it stopped working. Machines -- we often talk about machines, like cars, breaking down , particularly cars. “My car broke down. The engine stopped working or there was  some problem with it.” The woman then says, “I see what you mean.” This me ans, “I understand what you’re saying,” and it is a good expression to show  the other person that you are listening. “I see what you mean.”  I understand. Th at’s why she then says, “I understand why you’re concerned.” “To be concerned”  means to be worried, to be anxious, to be thinking about a problem. The man  says that he hopes that it’s just a “phase” his son is “going through.” The expr ession “just a phase he’s going through” means – Well, let’s start with the word “p hase.” “Phase” is – here, means a period of time or a length of time, a “phas e” of something.  For example, we talk about the “phases of the moon,” when the mo on is full and when the moon is half – a half moon, a new moon.  When you c an’t see the moon at all, we call that a “new moon.” Those are all “phases” of the moon and that just means the period of time. But when you say someone is “going through a phase,” we mean it’s a temporary -- or we hope it’s  a temporary change in their behavior or in their attitude.  That’s what the man  means when he says, he hopes his son – that “it’s just a phase he’s going through,” meaning he’ll eventually, as he gets older, not have these proble ms. That’s what we hope anyway.

The woman says, “You may be right but it doesn’t hu rt to find out more.” The expression “it doesn’t hurt,” means it would be a g ood idea; it won’t cause you any problems to do something else like ask more que stions. It has nothing to do with physically hurting like you hit your head on the door or something. That’s not what the expression refers to. “It doesn’t hurt to”  and then the verb about what you’re saying the person should do. “It doesn’t hur t to close your windows at night, in case it rains.” It won’t cost you that mu ch. It doesn’t cause you problems. The man then says that he appreciates the opportuni ty to talk to the woman and says, “It helps to get it off my chest.” The expres sion, “to get something off your chest,” means that -- usually there’s some problem or something that you want to tell someone and if you tell them it, you will feel  better. So, let’s say you perhaps, have a – something you want to tell your husband or  wife or boyfriend or girlfriend or your teacher, but you’re reluctant, y ou don’t really want to, and finally you decide to tell them and you say, “I want to get  this off my chest” – means it’s been bothering me and I now want to tell you so tha t I’ll feel better about whatever it is.

The woman says that her “door is always open.” When  someone says, “My door is always open,” they mean you can come and talk to  me anytime you want – that I’m available for you to talk to.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Woman: Hi. Long time no see. How have you been?

Man: Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some troubl e with my son.

Woman: Tell me all about it.

Man: Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's b ecome quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think  he’s running around with the wrong crowd.

# Room Service

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 90: Room Service.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 90. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about room service in a hotel. L et’s eat!

[start of dialogue]

I was staying at a nice resort hotel in Arizona on a short vacation. I had been out on the golf course playing a round of golf. When I got back into the room, I was feeling pretty hungry. I was meeting some friends f or a late dinner around 8:30. I wanted a snack. I took a look at the room service m enu and called their number.

Woman: Room service. What would you like to order?

Jeff: Hi, I'm in room 1201 and I'd like an order of  the calamari and a slice of cheesecake.

Woman: Do you want the calamari appetizer or the en trée?

Jeff: I'd like the appetizer.

Woman: Anything to drink?

Jeff: A diet Coke. About how long will that take?

Woman: It'll be about 30 minutes.

Jeff: Okay. Thanks.

There was a knock on my door about a half hour late r.

Jeff: Who is it?

Woman: Room service...Hi. Where would you like me to put the tray?

Jeff: On the desk would be fine.

Woman: The total is $16.75.

Jeff: Oh, that's higher than I'd expected.

Woman: There's a 12% service charge for room servic e and there's also the usual food tax.

Jeff: Oh, I see. Can I charge it to the room?

Woman: Sure. Just fill in the total here, write in your room number, and sign at the bottom.

Jeff: Okay, there you go. Thanks.

Woman: Thank you and have a nice day.

The calamari and the cheesecake really hit the spot .

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast we are on a short vacation in Arizo na, the state next to California – one of the states next to California. Very dry, l ots of desert. Anyway, we are in a nice “resort hotel.” A “resort hotel,” or simply a “resort,” is a hotel that has other services such as a golf course, maybe a spa where y ou can get a massage and so forth. More luxurious, more expensive hotels som etimes are resorts and the idea is that you can go and spend your whole vacati on and you would have plenty of things to do at the hotel. The “golf course” is where you play the game of “golf,”  where you hit a little light ball with a stick and the “golf course” is the place whe re golf is played. That’s (course) “course,” and a game of golf can called ei ther “a game of golf” or a “round of golf.” A “round of golf” means that you a re playing either nine holes because in golf you have possible 18 holes. You hit  the ball from one hole to the other. You can play 9 holes or 18 holes and a “roun d of golf” could be either one of those.

I said I was meeting some friends for a late dinner  at around 8:30 but I wanted a “snack.” And a “snack” (snack) is a small amount of  food, usually between meals. So, you have breakfast at 8 in the morning. You mig ht have a “snack,” say, an apple or a banana at 10 o’clock and then, if you’re  working in the United States, you would have lunch around noon. If you want to ge t food at a hotel and you want the food delivered to you, you call “room serv ice.” “Room service,” two

words, is the name that we give that service in a h otel that delivers you food from their restaurant or their kitchen.

So, I call room service and the first thing I do is  say, “I’m in room 1201 and I’d like an order of calamari and a slice of cheese cake.” T he expression, “I’d like an order of,” is how you say, “I want to have one plat e or one dish of” that particular food. Notice also that we say, “I want an order of the calamari.” You can also say, “I want an order of calamari” – means the same. “Ca lamari” (calamari) is squid. “Squid” (squid) is a type of seafood. It’s a small – what’s called a “mollusk” in English (mollusk) and it’s a type of seafood, and y ou fry it up in oil and you get “calamari.”  I also wanted a “slice of cheesecake.”  A “slice of cake” is a piece of cake. We often use that for anything where you can cut up, like a “slice of pie,” a “slice of cake,” even a “slice of bread” when you h ave a big loaf of bread and you cut it up into small “slices” or pieces. “Cheesecak e” is a very rich desert that has cream and soft cheese and a – what we call a “crust ” (crust). That’s what’s on the bottom and the side. That’s the “crust” of the chee secake. I happen to love cheesecake but it can make you a little overweight so you have to be careful. Don’t eat too much cheesecake.

The woman asks me if I wanted the calamari “appetiz er” or the “entrée.” An “appetizer” is the first course, what you have befo re your main course, and that main course is called the “entrée” (entrée), anothe r one of the French words that we borrowed in English. And the “entrée” is your ma in course, your main dish. I said I wanted the appetizer. In fact, I said, “I’d like the appetizer,” meaning I want the appetizer or smaller size of calamari, not the entrée. The woman then asked if I wanted anything to drink. She said, simply, “A nything to drink?” – which is just a short version of, “Would you like anything to dri nk?” I ordered a diet Coke and then I asked, “About how long will that take?” mean ing, “How much time do I have to wait for my food?”  “How long will it take? ” When we say, “How long will it take?” – you can use that about any amount of time.  For example, your brother needs to go to the store and he asked you to drive him and you say, “Well how long will that take?” meaning, “How much time is th at going to take me?”

The woman comes back with my food and she knocks on  the door and I say, “Who is it?” That’s what we would say when someone knocks on your door and you don’t know who it is. “Who is it?” You’re askin g them to identify themselves. She comes in, she gives me the food, and the price or the total is more than I thought it was going to be and I say, “That was hig her than I expected,” meaning it cost more than I thought it would. And the woman  from room service says that there’s a 12% “service charge.” A “service charge” is what a hotel will charge you for bringing that food up to your room, so there’s the price of the food and then there’s the price of the service. It’s kind of like  a tip, but usually in American

hotels people add a dollar or two after the service  charge, though you don’t have to do that. I asked the woman if I can “charge it to the room.” When you “charge something to your room” in a hotel, what you’re say ing is that you want this to go on your bill and you will pay for everything when y ou leave or check out of the hotel, and it’s pretty common if you eat room servi ce or in the restaurant of a hotel. You can ask to put something on your bill. T he woman says, “Of course,” asked me to write my name and my room number so tha t they can find my bill at the front desk of the hotel, and after she leaves, I say that the cheesecake and calamari “really hit the spot.” When we say somethi ng “hits the spot” we mean that the food really was very satisfying and I am no longer hungry. “That hit the spot. I really felt like it and I ate it and now I’ m not hungry anymore.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I was staying at a nice resort hotel in Arizona on a short vacation. I had been out on the golf course playing a round of golf. When I got back into the room, I was feeling pretty hungry. I was meeting some friends f or a late dinner around 8:30. I wanted a snack. I took a look at the room service m enu and called their number.

Woman: Room service. What would you like to order?

Jeff: Hi, I'm in room 1201 and I'd like an order of  the calamari and a slice of cheesecake.

Woman: Do you want the calamari appetizer or the en tree?

Jeff: I'd like the appetizer.

Woman: Anything to drink?

Jeff: A diet Coke. About how long will that take?

Woman: It'll be about 30 minutes.

Jeff: Okay. Thanks.

There was a knock on my door about a half hour late r.

Jeff: Who is it?

Woman: Room service...Hi. Where would you like me to put the tray?

Jeff: On the desk would be fine.

Woman: The total is $16.75.

Jeff: Oh, that's higher than I'd expected.

Woman: There's a 12% service charge for room servic e and there's also the usual food tax.

Jeff: Oh, I see. Can I charge it to the room?

Woman: Sure. Just fill in the total here, write in your room number, and sign at the bottom.

Jeff: Okay, there you go. Thanks.

Woman: Thank you and have a nice day.

The calamari and the cheesecake really hit the spot .

# Thanksgiving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 91: Thanksgiving.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 91. I’m Dr. Jeff McQuillan, your host, from the Center for Education al Development in Los Angeles – in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about Thanksgiving or Thanksgivi ng Day, a holiday celebration in the United States. Let’s get started ! > Thanksgiving reminds us to be grateful, but for a l ot of people, the holiday also means a weekend of eating a lot and watching footba ll, and my family is no exception.
> My family likes to have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner each year. We invite people from our extended family. We also invite clo se friends, especially those who don't have family in town. When it comes to Tha nksgiving dinner, our motto is “The more the merrier.”
> Our dinner, of course, starts with a big turkey, ba ked in the oven. I always carve it before it's served. Then we have the fixings. We  always have mashed potatoes, stuffing, yams, cranberries, and corn on the cob. Some years, we go wild and have other vegetables and sides. And for d essert, we have pumpkin pie. My wife is not a big fan of pumpkin pie so for her,  we also have ice cream.
> After we have a really big meal, we usually watch f ootball on TV. Things usually get pretty rowdy since there are always fans on bot h sides rooting for their own team to win. Last year, my uncle almost got into a fistfight with my nephew. Luckily, no one‚ and no furniture, was harmed. That  was a relief!

We’re talking about Thanksgiving in this podcast. “ Thanksgiving Day” is a celebration in the United States. It’s an “official  holiday,” which means all the government offices are closed. The post office and schools are closed. Most people have the day off; they don’t have to work. I t is a celebration that, according to the traditional story, celebrates “the  pilgrims.” “The pilgrims” (pilgrims) were some of the first settlers or colon ists to come from Europe to the

United States back in 1620 – 1620’s, I should say. And the “Thanksgiving Day” celebrates the first, or one of the first “harvest festivals.” A “harvest festival” is a celebration that you have in the fall. When the end  of the growing season – so, you gather in all your food and you have a festival . Many cultures have a “harvest festival” and in the United States, it’s Thanksgivi ng Day. It’s always the fourth Thursday of November.

In other countries, there is also Thanksgiving Day.  In Canada, there’s a Thanksgiving Day on the second Monday in October. B ut here in the United States, it’s in November. “Thanksgiving” means, of course, to give thanks, to be grateful, and to be “grateful” (grateful) means tha t you are thankful or that you are appreciative of all the good things that you have. In my family – in most families, it’s a day to get together with your family in the afternoon or evening and to have a big meal and I said that my family is “no excepti on,” meaning we are not an exception. We’re not unlike other people. We are li ke other people. We also have a big meal and a celebration.

In my family, we have a traditional Thanksgiving di nner and I’ll tell you what that is in a second. We invite people from our “extended  family,” and your “extended family” is your aunts, your uncles, your nephews, y our nieces. Your “immediate family” is just you, your brothers and sisters, the  children and so forth. “Extended family” includes grandma and grandpa and aunts and uncles and cousins and so forth. We always invite people who don’t have “fami ly in town” and to say I have “family in town” means I have members in my family who live here. We often use the expression “I have family back in Minnesota.” S ome of my family members are I Minnesota. Well, I say that. You wouldn’t say  that probably.

The Thanksgiving dinner, I said, we have a “motto.”  A “motto” (motto) – a “motto” is a slogan. It’s a saying, usually an official exp ression. For example, in the United States, if you look on our coins, our money,  you’ll see the “motto” “In God We Trust.” That’s one of our official, if not our o fficial, “motto.” Our motto for Thanksgiving dinner in my family is “The more the m errier.” The expression “the more the merrier” means the more people that come, the better it is, so we want as many people to come as possible. “The more the m errier.” “To be merry” (merry) means to be happy, so the more people, the happier we are. I said our dinner is a “traditional Thanksgiving dinner” and t hat usually means, in the United States, a turkey, a big 10, 15, maybe 20 pound turk ey, which, of course, is a bird, and you put the big turkey in an oven and you “bake ” it. That is, you cook it in an oven. “To bake” is to cook in an oven. And after it ’s ready, you take it out and you “carve” it. “To carve a turkey” means to cut the me at off of the turkey. We use the verb “to carve.” Normally, “to carve” means that yo u take a knife to wood, for

example, and you put letters into the wood. That wo uld be “carving into the wood” or “carving the wood.” This is a verb we use for cutting turkeys.

I also said that at our traditional dinner we have “fixings.” “Fixings” is all of the other things besides the turkey, besides the main c ourse. All the – what we would call “the sides” – that is the “side dishes,”  the dishes in addition to the main dish, which is the turkey. Some “sides” that are co mmon for Thanksgiving are “mashed potatoes.” “Mashed potatoes” – “potato,” of  course, is a round white, usually, inside, and you “peel” the potato. You tak e the skin off. “To peel” (peel) is to take the skin off of the potato. And you usually  bake it or you boil it in water and then you mash it up with a fork, put a little m ilk and butter. Hmm, I’m getting hungry just talking about it. “Stuffing” – “stuffin g” is bread crumbs, usually with some other spices, onions.  Everyone has a differen t recipe for “stuffing.” It’s what you put inside the turkey. It bakes inside the  turkey. It’s like a bread side dish. You can also make stuffing or what we would p robably call “dressing.” That’s the same thing but you cook it outside the t urkey. “Yams” are also common. “Yams” (yams) – I don’t like yams myself bu t many people do and it’s – another name for a “yam” is a “sweet potato.” It’s a type of – think of it as a type of potato. “Cranberries” are traditional for Thanks giving. “Cranberries” are small red berries. “Corn on the cob” is – some families h ave “corn on the cob.” The “cob” of corn is what the corn grows on. It’s the m iddle that you don’t eat but you take the corn off of the cob or you can cook it on the cob and then eat it. Put butter and salt or something and then you can eat the corn right from the cob.

Sometimes, I said, we “go wild” and have other vege tables and dishes. “To go wild” can mean a lot of things but normally it mean s you’re going beyond what you normally do. It could also mean getting very ex cited. “Don’t go wild.” Don’t get too excited. But here it means – it’s used some what comically, somewhat as a joke, to mean that we do more than what we normal ly would do. For dessert, or the least meal – part of your meal, the sweet part of your meal, the traditional pie is a “pumpkin pie.” A “pumpkin pie” – “pumpkins,” of course, become ripe or ready to eat in the fall – a big round orange “pump kin” – and people make “pumpkin pie.” My wife is not a “big fan” of pumpki n pie. To say you’re a “big fan of” means you really like it. Well, my wife is not a “big fan” and so, for her we have ice cream.

Normally on Thanksgiving, there are “football” game s and here, we mean American football and it’s traditional to – for som e families, to sit around and watch football games on Thanksgiving Day. I said th at my family can get a little “rowdy.” “Rowdy” (rowdy) means noisy and loud and m aking a lot of noise because there are people who are rooting for their own team to win while they’re watching it on TV. “To root” (root) – “to root for”  someone or some team means

that you are hoping that they will win. So, I gradu ated, for example, from the University of Southern California and I’m “rooting”  for them to win the national football championship.

My uncle, I said, almost got into a “fistfight” wit h my nephew. A “fistfight” – well, first of all, a “fight,” you know, of course, is – two people have an argument and they start hitting each other. Your “fist” is your hand, but your hand when you put it in a position like a ball to hit someone. That’s  your fist. So, a “fistfight” is when two people are hitting each other with their “fists ” (fist). Finally, I said, “No one was hurt,” and, “That was a relief.” When we say, “ That was a relief,” we mean that something bad could’ve happened but it didn’t.  For example, “My sister almost missed her flight from San Jose,”  means she  almost didn’t make it to the plane but she made it and “that’s a relief,” someth ing that could’ve happened but it didn’t.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

Thanksgiving reminds us to be grateful, but for a l ot of people, the holiday also means a weekend of eating a lot and watching footba ll and my family is no exception.

My family likes to have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner each year. We invite people from our extended family. We also invite clo se friends, especially those who don't have family in town. When it comes to Tha nksgiving dinner, our motto is “The more the merrier.”

Our dinner, of course, starts with a big turkey, ba ked in the oven. I always carve it before it's served. Then we have the fixings.

My wife is not a big fan of pumpkin pie so for her,  we also have ice cream.

After we have a really big meal, we usually watch f ootball on TV. Things usually get pretty rowdy since there are always fans on bot h sides rooting for their own team to win. Last year, my uncle almost got into a fistfight with my nephew. Luckily, no one‚ and no furniture, was harmed. That  was a relief!

# Types of Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 92 – Types of Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 92. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today's podcast is about types of work. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

I got a call yesterday from Amy, a co-worker from the office. She and I work in the same department. We've had lunch at work a few times, but I really didn't know her that well. I was really glad she called.

Kevin: Hello.

Amy: Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?

Kevin: This is Kevin.

Amy: Oh, hi. It's Amy, from work.

Kevin: Oh, hey, how's it going? I didn't recognize your voice.

Amy: Not bad. Listen, the reason I'm calling is tha t I'm having a dinner party a week from Saturday at my place around seven thirty.  I wanted to see if you could make it.

Kevin: So, it's not this Saturday but the Saturday after that. That would be the 17th.

Amy: Yeah, that's right, the following Saturday – the 17th.

Kevin: Let me just check my calendar. Yeah, I think  I can make it. Are you inviting anyone else from work?

Amy: Yeah, I am. Jennifer from marketing already RS VP’d, so she'll be there for sure, and I'm waiting to hear back from James in ac counting. I've also invited a few other friends.

 Kevin: Just out of curiosity, are they in finance, too?

Amy: No. My friend Janis is in the medical field. S he's an orthopedic surgeon. She's bringing her boyfriend, Tim, and I think he's  an engineer in the automobile industry. Then there's Megan. She works part-time i n retail and moonlights as a tour guide on the weekends. She's been wanting to g et into the hospitality industry for a long time.

Kevin: Wow, that sounds like a great group of peopl e. I'm looking forward to it. Can I bring anything?

Amy: No, that's okay. Just come and bring your appe tite.

Kevin: Sounds great. Thanks for the invitation.

Amy: No problem. I'm glad you can make it. See you in the office tomorrow.

Kevin: See you then. Bye.

[end of dialogue]

We just listened to a telephone conversation betwee n two people who work at the same office, Kevin and Amy. Amy calls up Kevin,  and Kevin answers the phone by saying “Hello,” which is how we answer the  phone in English: “Hello.” “Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?” When you're calling s omeone on the phone, and you don't know if you got the right person, you can  ask, “May I speak to Kevin?” or “Could I speak to Jeff?” or whomever you are try ing to reach.

Kevin identifies himself by saying, “This is Kevin, ” meaning “I am Kevin.” We would not actually say, “I am Kevin,” though. We sa y, “This is Kevin.” Amy says, “Oh, hi. It's Amy from work,” and Kevin replies, “O h, hey, how's it going?” We sometimes use the word “hey” to mean something simi lar to “hi” or “hello.” It's very informal, but you will hear that very often. K evin says he didn't “recognize” (recognize) Amy's voice, meaning he didn't know tha t it was her. Amy invites Kevin to a dinner party. A “dinner party” is a dinn er, but a little more formal dinner – usually a dinner with several people.

The party is going to be “a week from Saturday.” “A  week from Saturday” means the Saturday that comes seven days from the closest  Saturday in the future. So for example, if today is Friday, and you tell someo ne you're going to have a party “a week from Saturday,” you mean not tomorrow, but seven days from tomorrow.

“The following Saturday” is another way we could say that. Amy says the dinner party is going to be “at my place.” The word “place ” (place) here means where I live – my apartment or my house. We often refer to where we live as “my place.” “Where is your place?” Well, my place is in Los Ang eles, on the west side.

Kevin says, “Let me just check my calendar.” A “cal endar” (calendar) is a list of days of the month or the days of the week. So, “to check your calendar” means to make sure you have a certain day, or date, avail able. Kevin says that he does. He then asks Amy who else will be at the dinner par ty, and she says that “Jennifer from marketing already RSVP’d.” “Marketin g (marketing) is the part of a company that lets other people know about their pro duct or service. That's part of marketing.

“To RSVP” means to write or to call someone back to  tell them whether or not you are going to be at a party. When you have a spe cial party or some sort of formal event, you will often ask people to RSVP. “R SVP” is a French expression. It stands for “ Répondez s'il vous plaît .” My French is not very good. I apologize to all of our French speaking listeners. But in Englis h, we just say “RSVP,” which we use as a verb. For example, “I RSVP’d to his inv itation” means I responded to his invitation and let him know if I would be at his party.

Amy also says she's “waiting to hear back from Jame s in accounting.” “To wait to hear back” means to wait for someone to call you ba ck. James works in accounting. “Accounting” (accounting) is the part of a company that takes care of the money, for the most part. The accounting depart ment takes care of all the different types of records, taxes, and so forth. the different parts of a big company are called “departments.” James works in ac counting, or in the accounting department.

Kevin then asks “just out of curiosity” if Amy's ot her guests are also in finance. “Curiosity” (curiosity) is your interest in knowing  more about something, and the expression “just out of curiosity” is something we say when we are asking a question that doesn't directly relate to the topic we've been talking about. So, we could be talking about baseball, and you might say,  “Yeah, my uncle recently went to a baseball game,” and I might say, “Just ou t of curiosity, is he your uncle who lives in San Francisco?” My question isn’t exac tly related to what we were talking about, but I just want to know. I am curiou s to know.

Amy is in finance. “Finance” (finance) is the part of a company or a type of company that deals with money. But it's a little di fferent from accounting. “Finance” deals with getting money or with loaning money to a company. That would be the job of someone in finance. Another of Amy's friends is in the

medical field. The word “field” (field) here just m eans a type of work. You can talk about the education field, or the accounting field,  or the medical field. All of those just mean a particular area or type of work. Someon e who works in the “medical field” would be someone who works in a hospital or in a clinic, for example.

Amy's friend Janis is an “orthopedic surgeon.” A “s urgeon” (surgeon) is a doctor who cuts you open to work on you in an operating ro om. That is a room in the hospital where, for example, if you had a heart att ack and needed to have your heart fixed, the surgeon would open up your chest a nd operate on your heart. That kind of doctor is called a “surgeon,” and an “ orthopedic (orthopedic) surgeon” is a surgeon who works on your bones. So, if you broke your leg and you needed surgery to fix it, you would go to an or thopedic surgeon.

Amy says that Janis is bringing her boyfriend, Tim,  to the dinner party, and that Tim is “an engineer in the automobile industry.” An  “engineer” (engineer) is a general term for someone who works in a technical f ield, often involving math and science. The “automobile industry” is the car i ndustry. And “industry” (industry) here means the same as field. It's an ar ea of work, a type of work.

Another of Amy's friends, Megan, “works part-time i n retail but moonlights as a tour guide on the weekends.” The word “retail” (ret ail) has to do with selling things. So when you say, “I work in retail,” it usu ally means that you work in a store that sells things to the general public, like  a grocery store or a department store. A “department store” is a store that sells m any different things, like clothing and electronics and kitchenware.

Megan works in retail, but “moonlights as a tour gu ide.” “To moonlight” (moonlight) – all one word – means to work at anoth er job in addition to your main job. So, I have my regular job working as a te acher, for example, but I want to make some more money, because teachers often don 't get paid very much money, so I might moonlight as a waiter at a restau rant. That's not my regular job. It's an additional job. I guess we use the ter m “moonlight” because it is often a job you do at night when the moon is up.

A “tour (tour) guide (guide)” – two words – is some one who works showing visitors a particular place. It could be in a singl e building. For example, a museum has tour guides who take people around and t ell them what all the things are in the museum. This is especially useful  when you go to a modern art museum, because you can't figure out what it means without them. A tour guide can also be someone who drives you around an entire  city. So, if you come to Los Angeles, you can take a tour, and the tour guid e will be the person who will be telling you everything about the city.

 Finally, Kevin says that he's “looking forward to it.” “To look forward to” something means to want it to happen. He asksif he can bring anything to the dinner party, and Amy tells him to “just come and bring your appetite.” When someone says, “Just come and bring your appetite,” it means they don't want you to bring anything to the party, but they want you to arrive hungry and ready to eat. It's a polite way of saying you don't have to do anything but come and enjoy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I got a call yesterday from Amy, a co-worker from the office. She and I work in the same department. We've had lunch at work a few times, but I really didn't know her that well. I was really glad she called.

Kevin: Hello.

Amy: Hi. Could I speak to Kevin?

Kevin: This is Kevin.

Amy: Oh, hi. It's Amy, from work.

Kevin: Oh, hey, how's it going? I didn't recognize your voice.

Amy: Not bad. Listen, the reason I'm calling is tha t I'm having a dinner party a week from Saturday at my place around seven thirty.  I wanted to see if you could make it.

Kevin: So, it's not this Saturday but the Saturday after that. That would be the 17th.

# Diversity at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 93: Diversity at Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 93. I’m your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Developm ent in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is called Diversity at Work. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: What were you and Richard talking about earli er? It looked intense.

Lucy: Yeah, Richard said something to me that I did n't appreciate.

Jeff: Oh, no. I know how insensitive he can be. Wha t has he done now?

Lucy: He asked me how long it took me to learn Engl ish.

Jeff: But you were born and raised in California!

Lucy: Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't ma tter how many generations my family has lived in the U.S., we'll always be forei gners in their eyes.

Jeff: What a racist! How can you stand working with  the guy?

Lucy: You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He ma de the comment out of ignorance, not malice.

Jeff: So, what did you say when he asked you how lo ng it took you to learn English?

Lucy: I told him 28 years, and he knows I'm 28 year s old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute and then he got it.

Jeff: Are you sure he really got the message?

Lucy: Yeah, I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English.

 Jeff: That's hilarious! What did he say?

Lucy: He said, "36 years," and we both laughed abou t it. He apologized and now it's all good.

Jeff: I'm glad. I bet he won't make that mistake ag ain.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking in this podcast about “diversity at w ork” and the word “diversity,” when used in business or in schools in the United S tates, means people – talking about people from different backgrounds, perhaps, d ifferent cultures and to be “diverse” is to have people represented from differ ent backgrounds and different cultures. In the discussion today, we’re talking ab out the assumption that some people make that if you look different, if you’re n ot, for example, Caucasian or white-looking, that you don’t speak English as a na tive speaker here in the United States. And that assumption is made by some people and that’s the problem that happens in today’s podcast. The podcas t begins with me asking Lucy what she and Richard were talking about and I say, “It looked intense.” “Intense” (intense), here, means something that was  very serious or very difficult. Something that involves a very strong emotion would  be “intense.”

Lucy says that “Yeah. Richard said something to me that I didn’t appreciate.” “Yeah” (yeah) is the same as yes – informal way of saying yes. When Lucy says she “didn’t appreciate it” – “I didn’t appreciate,”  she says, means, “I didn’t like it. It’s something that I didn’t want to hear.” I say to Lucy that Richard is “insensitive.” “To be insensitive” means that you d o not understand or respect other people’s feelings or emotions. To say somethi ng that would hurt someone or to make someone mad or upset, that would be some one who is “insensitive.” I then asked Lucy, “What has he – Richard – done now? ” The expression “What has he done now?” doesn’t mean, “What did he do this very moment?” but we use that expression, particularly the word, “now,” to mean he’s done something bad in the past and now he’s done something again s o you would say that about someone who has already done something wrong in the  past. “What have you done now?” meaning you’ve done things wrong in the past about this topic.

Lucy explains that Richard asked how long it took h er to learn English and I say, “But you were born and raised in California,” meani ng she was born here and she was “raised” – she grew up here is what “raised ” means. And if you are “born and raised” in California or any other part of an E nglish speaking area, you would be a native speaker of English. Lucy says, “Yeah, b ut I get that sometimes.” The

expression, “I get that,” refers to that kind of co mment or that kind of question. And she goes on to say that “no matter how many gen erations” her family has lived in the U.S, they will always be foreigners “i n their eyes.” “Generations” means – different parts of a family have different “generations.” Your grandfather is one “generation” and your father is – or mother – is a second “generation,” – another “generation” and you are another “generatio n.” So, we talk about “generations,” we mean that part of the family that  is of the same line, we might say. To say something will be “in their eyes” means  in their opinion. It means they see everything in a certain way.

I respond by saying, “What a racist!” meaning Richa rd is a racist. “To be a racist” (racist) means you are someone who judges people ba sed upon their physical appearance, the color of their skin. Then I asked L ucy, “How can you stand working with the guy?” “How can you stand” means ho w can you tolerate, how can you put up with, how can you – how are you able  to work with him even though he causes problems. Lucy says that “Richard isn’t such a bad guy,” that he “made the comment out of ignorance not malice.” A couple of expressions there. “To make a comment out of” means the reason I made that comment. Here she says that Richard made the comment “out of  ignorance.” “To be ignorant” means that you don’t know and so, if you make a comment “out of ignorance,” you mean the person didn’t know. He mad e the comment out of ignorance not “malice.” “Malice” (malice) means to have a bad or evil intention.

So, I ask Lucy what she sad to Richard and Lucy say s she told him it took her 28 years to learn English. And, of course, she’s 28 ye ars old, meaning she’s learned English from the time she was a baby. “Richard was puzzled for a minute but then he got it.” “To be puzzled” (puzzled) is a ver b. “To puzzle” or “to be puzzled” means to be confused, not to know what the answer i s. As a noun, a “puzzle” (puzzle) is a game or a problem that you have to so lve. The expression, “He got it,” means he understood it, so Richard “got it.” I  then asked Lucy, “Are you sure he really got the message?” “To say, “Do you get th emessage?” means do you understand the main point, the main idea that I am trying to communicate or tell you. “He didn’t get the message” means he didn’t un derstand. We often use this for when we are telling someone something that mayb e they don’t want to hear or that may be difficult for them and when you say,  “I got the message,” means “Okay, I understand. You don’t need to tell me anym ore.”

Lucy then asked Richard how long it took him to lea rn English and I said that that’s “hilarious.” “Hilarious” (hilarious) means very funny, or extremely funny. Lucy said that Richard apologized and now “it’s all  good.” The expression, “It’s all good,” is an informal expression, which means every thing is fine; there are no problems. We say that probably a younger – the youn ger generation would say

that – younger people. “It’s all good,” meaning no problems. You could also say that when life is going well for you and everything  seems to be successful for you. You could say, “It’s all good.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: What were you and Richard talking about earli er? It looked intense.

Lucy: Yeah, Richard said something to me that I did n't appreciate.

Jeff: Oh, no. I know how insensitive he can be. Wha t has he done now?

Lucy: He asked me how long it took me to learn Engl ish.

Jeff: But you were born and raised in California!

Lucy: Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't ma tter how many generations my family has lived in the U.S., we'll always be forei gners in their eyes.

Jeff: What a racist! How can you stand working with  the guy?

Lucy: You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He ma de the comment out of ignorance, not malice.

Jeff: So, what did you say when he asked you how lo ng it took you to learn English?

Lucy: I told him 28 years and, he knows I'm 28 year s old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute,  and then he got it.

Jeff: Are you sure he really got the message?

Lucy: Yeah, I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English.

Jeff: That's hilarious! What did he say?

Lucy: He said, "36 years," and we both laughed abou t it. He apologized and now it's all good.

 Jeff: I'm glad. I bet he won't make that mistake ag ain.

[end of dialogue]

That’s going to do it for today. I want to thank yo u for listening. From Los Angeles, California, we’ll see you next time on ESL  Podcast.

# Nervous at an Interview I

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 94: Nervous at an Interview part I.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 94. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about being nervous at an interv iew and this is the first of two parts to this podcast. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was on my way to an interview and there was a lot  of traffic on the road. I got to the office in the nick of time for my appointment. I walked into the lobby of the building and looked at the directory. I saw that Ca sey Enterprises was on the penthouse floor and headed to the elevator. The doo r was just closing.

David: Could you hold the elevator, please? Thanks a lot.

Woman: No problem. What floor?

David: I'm headed to the 18th floor, the top floor.

Woman: Oh, so am I.

David: Do you work there? I have an interview today  with Dale Mendoza. Do you know her?

Woman: Yeah, I know her pretty well.

David: To tell you the truth, I'm really nervous. I  had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that ke pt trying to bite my head off. Oh, wow, my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms. Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering. I just h ope I get though this in one piece.

The elevator doors opened just then and we both wal ked out. I don't know why I poured my heart out to a perfect stranger, but it a ctually seemed to help me chill out a bit. I didn't feel quite as nervous.

 We were in the reception area and I headed to the r eception desk. The woman started walking in the other direction. She turned and called back, "Good luck," with a smile.

[end of dialogue]

We hear in this podcast the story of a man going to  an interview and is very nervous about the interview – the job interview. the story begins by him saying that, “I was on my way to an interview.” “To be on your way” means that you are traveling towards, you are moving in that direction . “I’m on my way to the store” means I am going perhaps in my car to the store. the man said there was “a lot of traffic on the road,” meaning a lot of cars in the street or on the freeway, and he says he got to the office “in the nick of time” for his appointment. “To get somewhere in the nick (nick) of time” means that yo u get there just before it’s too late. You get there right at or just before the tim e you are supposed to be there, so if you’re appointment is at 9’oclock, and you ar rive at 8:57, you got there “in the nick of time.”

The man walks into a “lobby” (lobby) of the buildin g. The lobby is when you first walk into a building before you get to the offices.  There’s usually an area like a welcoming area which we would call “the lobby.” And  the man walks over and looks at the “directory.” And the “directory” for the building is a list of all of the offices, who is in what office and what floor they’ re on or which company is on which floor if it’s a tall building. And the man fi nds out that the place he is going is on the “penthouse” floor. The “penthouse” (penthous e), all one word, is the top floor of a building, usually a tall building. The “ penthouse” floor is often -- for example, if it were an apartment or a condominium b uilding, a building of different living units, then the top floor is often  the best floor and it is the most luxurious, but here it just means the top of the bu ilding, the very top floor.

The man goes towards the elevator and the door is “ just closing,” meaning it’s just starting to close. And he says to the woman in side, “Could you hold the elevator please?” “To hold the elevator” means to k eep the door open to stop the door from closing. We use that expression; “Could y ou hold the door” means could you open the door, could you make sure the do or stays open. The man then uses an informal expression, “Thanks a lot!” “ Thanks a lot” means thank you very much but it’s more informal. And the woman res ponds also with an informal expression. She says, “No problem.” “No problem” he re means “you’re welcome” but you’ll find it very common in many situations t hat a native speaker of English will respond to someone thanking them by saying, “N o problem” instead of

“You’re welcome,” but they mean the same. “No probl em” is a little – a bit more informal.

The woman says to the man, “What floor?” meaning wh at floor do you want to get off on. And the man says he’s going to the “top  floor,” which is the same as the “penthouse floor.” The woman says, “Oh, so am I ,”  meaning I am also. “So am I.” That’s a correct, if you will, formal way of  saying it. An informal way of saying it would be “Me too.” Even though it’s gramm atically incorrect, it’s still very common to hear people say, “Me too” instead of “So am I.” The man asked the woman if she knows Dale Mendoza, and the woman says  yes and then the man begins to say or talk about how nervous he is. He s ays, “To tell you the truth, I’m really nervous.” The expression “To tell you the tr uth,” or “To tell the truth” before – as a beginning of a sentence before something els e usually is when you are going to say something to a person that you might n ot tell them in a different situation, that you’re going to be very honest. It’ s often something that’s negative that you’re going to tell this person and here the man tells the woman that he’s really nervous. He talks about a dream he had last night where he was interviewed by a “three-headed monster,” which woul d be -- a “monster,” of course, is a fictional animal that is mean, and Fra nkenstein, for example, is a monster. And a “three-headed monster” would be a mo nster with three heads, which, of course, is ridiculous but that’s the drea m that the man has.

He said that the monster “kept trying to bite my he ad off.” The expression “to bite your head off” here literally means that the monste r puts his head in his mouth and bites it off, but we also use that expression i n another situation to mean when you yell at someone, when you are angry with s omeone and you say very mean or very strong – with a very strong emotion. You may say, “Don’t bite my head off” – means don’t get very angry with me. But  here, it actually means the monster biting his head off. Now, the man is nervou s and he says his “palms are sweaty.” Your “palm” (palm) is the inside of your h and. It’s the central part, not the fingers or the thumb, but that rest of that ins ide of your hand is your “palm,” and if your palms are “sweaty,” meaning they’re wet , that’s often a sign that you are nervous.

The man also says that he hopes the woman who’s int erviewing him won’t hear his teeth “chattering.” “To chatter,” here, means to bite down – up and down very quickly. I’m not sure I can imitate that very well but when you’re teeth are “chattering,” you’re either very cold or you’re ver y nervous about something, and here the man is clearly nervous. The man finally sa ys, “I hope I get through this in one piece,” meaning I hope I survive this interv iew without any problems, without any damage. The expression, “I want to get through this in one piece,” means without any injury, without any problems taki ng place. The elevator doors

then opened and the man says, “I don’t know why I p oured out or poured my heart out to a perfect stranger.” “To pour your hea rt out” – “pour” (pour), like you would pour water into a glass – “to pour your heart  out” means to tell something to someone else that’s very personal, that’s very –  often emotional and it’s usually a sad thing or not a positive thing, a nega tive thing. The expression, a “perfect stranger,” is the same as a “complete stra nger,” and the words “perfect” and “complete” here are just giving the idea of it being a “stranger,” someone you don’t know, more emphasis. You could just say, “A s tranger,” and when you say “a perfect stranger” you’re just giving that fact m ore emphasis. It doesn’t really change the meaning of the word.

The man says that by telling this perfect stranger his story about being nervous, it helped him to “chill out a bit.” “To chill out” (ch ill) and then (out), two words, means to relax, to be calm. It’s an informal expres sion, probably more common among younger people. Someone tells you to “chill o ut,” they’re telling to relax, to calm down, don’t get excited. Sometimes we use the verb just “to chill.” “What are you doing?” “I’m chilling,” meaning I’m relaxin g, I’m taking it easy, I’m not working. Again, that’s a very informal use of the w ord. “To chill” also means to make cold but here it has nothing to do with that. Finally, the man and woman go their separate ways. She walks into the office and he goes to the “reception desk,” or the desk in the front of the office where  people first come. Usually, there is someone behind the desk that we would call the “ receptionist.” She or he is the person working at that desk.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I was on my way to an interview and there was a lot  of traffic on the road. I got to the office in the nick of time for my appointment. I walked into the lobby of the building and looked at the directory. I saw that Ca sey Enterprises was on the penthouse floor and headed to the elevator. The doo r was just closing.

# Nervous at an Interview II

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 95:  Nervous at an Interview II.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 95. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is part two of a two-part podcast. We began with number 94 called Nervous at an Interview. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was just in time for my interview and I was very nervous. I walked up to the receptionist. She was talking into a headset and ty ping on her keyboard.

David: Good morning. I'm David Laso. I have an appo intment with Dale Mendoza at 10 o'clock. Could you please let her know that I 'm here?

Receptionist: Please have a seat and I'll tell her.

About three minutes later, a man came out of the of fice and approached me. He introduced himself as Ben, Ms. Mendoza’s administra tive assistant. He told me he would show me to her office.

I followed him and we stopped in front of an office  door with a placard on the door with the name "Dale Mendoza" and her title "Vi ce President" written on it. Ben knocked on the door and opened it. By this time , I was feeling more confident and was actually looking forward to the i nterview.

Then I saw Dale Mendoza. She was the same woman who  was in the elevator on my way up. I had been so nervous that I just cou ldn't stop talking. I had told her how nervous I was about this interview. I had e ven told her about my nightmare with a three-headed monster interviewing me for a job. And now, here she was, my potential new boss.

Dale: Hello, you must be David. It's nice to meet y ou.

There was a frog in my throat. My heart was beating  a mile a minute.

David: It's nice to meet you, too.

Dale: Have a seat and make yourself comfortable. Yo u see? I only have one head and I don't even bite.

Needless to say, that was not my best interview. Bu t, you live and learn. I'll know next time to keep my mouth shut!

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast we heard the man going for a job in terview, who was very nervous, and he says that he was “just in time” for  his interview. “To be just in time” is the same as “in the nick of time,” meaning  you get there right before the time or the moment you are supposed to be there. the man walks up to the “receptionist,” who’s the person who works in the “ reception desk,” a place where you first go in an office, sort of a welcome place,  welcome desk, and the woman who’s working, the receptionist, is talking into a “headset.” A “headset” (headset), all one word, is what you would wear on your head t alking on the telephone, so there’s a piece that goes in your ear and there’s u sually a microphone that comes out and it’s – on the top of your head there’ s a band that attaches it to your head, if you will, and that is a “headset,” an d you can use a headset for talking on the computer, for example. You can liste n and talk in a headset.

The man says – he introduces himself, “I’m David La so,” which is the same, of course, as “My name is David Laso,” and tells the r eceptionist, “Could you please let Dale Mendoza know that I am here.” “Could you p lease let her know that I’m here?” That’s what you would say to someone who is a receptionist if you are waiting for an appointment. “Could you let her know ” means could you tell her that I am here. The receptionist says, “Please have  a seat,” meaning please sit down here and wait, and a few minutes later, a man comes out of the office and that man is Ms. Mendoza’s “administrative assistant .” An “administrative assistant” is someone who helps or assists an admin istrator, a person in charge of something. An “administrative assistant” is some one who is a helper to the person who is the boss or the person who has a supe rvisor or administrator role.

The man then “shows him to her office,” meaning he walks with him and shows him or indicates to him where the office him, a. An d the man notices – David notices – that there is a “placard” on the door. A “placard” (placard) is just a sign,. sSo, there’s a sign on the door with “Dale Mendoza”  on it and her “title,” “Vice President.” The “title” of someone is what their po sition is, what they do in a company. “The President,” “The Vice President,” “Th e Chief Executive Officer,” all of these are “titles.” “Titles” can also be ref erred to political figures, “The

President” of a country or “The Prime Minister” of a country. – That’s a “title,” the words “Prime Minister” and “President.” The man the n realizes that the woman he is interviewing with is the same woman he talked  to yesterday on the elevator – or rather talked to this – before the interview o n the elevator  and realizes that he has told her all of these things about him being  nervous. He says, “And now, here she was, my potential new boss.” “Here she was ,” meaning she’s here in front of me. “My potential new boss” – “potential” means my possible new boss.

The woman introduces herself and David says, in try ing to respond, that “there was a frog in my throat.” When we say we have a “fr og” (frog) – like the little green animal that jumps, a “frog.” “To have a frog in your throat” means that you’re having problems speaking. This is often beca use you may be nervous and so, “there’s a frog in his throat” means he doesn’t  know what to say. He says his heart was beating “a mile a minute.” When we say so mething is going or “beating” – your heart is “beating a mile a minute, ” it means that it is very – that you are very nervous and that your heart is going –  the other expression would be “Your heart is racing” – means it’s beating very  fast – that would be “going a mile a minute,” and, of course, going one mile in a  minute. well, that would be very fast.

The woman says, “Have a seat,” and says, “You see, I only have one head and I don’t even bite,” because David said he had a dream  that she was a three- headed monster. The story ends with David saying, “ Needless to say, that was not my best interview.” The expression, “Needless to say,” is something you would say before something very obvious. “Needless to say, if it’s sunny outside, the temperature might be warmer” – not always true,  I know, but the expression, “Needless to say,” means you’re going to say someth ing obvious now. It would be the same as “obviously” here. David says, “But y ou live and learn.” That’s kind of an old expression. “Live and learn” means you ma ke mistakes and you learn from your mistakes, you learn from your experiences . And he finally says, “I’ll know next time,” or the next time this happens, “to  keep my mouth shut,” meaning I won’t talk. “To keep your mouth shut” mea ns not to talk. We sometimes say to children, “Keep your mouth shut.” It’s kind of a rude – well, it’s something you would only say to a child. It’s very rude to say that to an adult but a parent who’s angry at their child might say, “Kee p your mouth shut,” meaning don’t talk.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I was just in time for my interview and I was very nervous. I walked up to the receptionist. She was talking into a headset and ty ping on her keyboard.

David: Good morning. I'm David Laso. I have an appo intment with Dale Mendoza at 10 o'clock. Could you please let her know that I 'm here?

Receptionist: Please have a seat and I'll tell her.

About three minutes later, a man came out of the of fice and approached me. He introduced himself as Ben, Ms. Mendoza’s administra tive assistant. He told me he would show me to her office.

# High School Reunion

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 96: High School Reunion.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 96. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Now let’s get started with this podcast on High Sch ool reunions. > When I got home from work, I opened my mail. The le tter turned out to be a bombshell. I held in my hand an invitation to my 10 -year high school reunion. It was a shock because I couldn't believe it had been 10 years. The first thing I did was to call my oldest and dearest friend, Maria. We  had gone to high school together and we had been best friends.
> Maria said that she had received her invitation in the mail, too. I told her that I was leaning against going. After all, why live in the past? I thought, but Maria convinced me that it would be a trip to see some of  our old friends and to find out what had become of them. At the very least, we woul d get a chance to see each other and to talk about old times.
> And, Maria said, Jeff McQuillan might be there. Ah,  Jeff McQuillan. He was a senior when I was a sophomore, and I had a big crus h on him. I thought he was so cute and he was smart, too. He was at the top of  his class. He wasn't the class clown, but he had a great sense of humor and was voted most likely to succeed. He never gave me a second look, but I alwa ys made sure I sat next to him in class. I wonder what he's doing now and whet her he'll be there. Hmm, maybe this reunion will be more fun than I thought.

In this podcast we hear about a high school “reunio n.” I should say, right from the beginning that I did not write this podcast, and yo u know this is not true for a couple of reasons. This is a work of fiction becaus e first, I was not cute or good looking in high school and second, this is not my 1 0th year anniversary of my high school graduation. I wish it were. Anyway, we’ re talking about high school “reunions” here and a “reunion” is when you have a meeting or a party with

people from your old high school or college class. And in the United States, it is very common. Most high schools have reunions, somet imes every five, sometimes every 10 years, usually a 10-year, 20-yea r, 25-year, where you go back and you talk to the people and you have a smal l party with people who you went to school with either in high school or in col lege. Though college – because college isn’t so big, it’s not quite as common.

This is a story about Lucy getting a letter in her mail and she says the letter “turned out to be a bombshell.” When we say somethi ng “turned out to be” we mean it resulted in the – or we might say “it ended  up being.” The idea is that you have some information or something happens and then  you wait a certain amount of time and then you discover or find out wh at the actual event or what the result is. For example, the doctor finds a smal l bump or lump on your arm and they examine it closely and it “turns out” to b e nothing serious, meaning they find out later it’s nothing serious. Here, she look s at the letter, she opens it and it turns out to be, she says, “a bombshell.” A “bombsh ell” is something that is a big surprise, an incredible surprise. It could be a goo d surprise. It could be a bad surprise. Lucy then says, “I held in my hand an inv itation to my 10-year high school reunion,” That expression, “I held in my han d,” seems a little obvious, a little redundant, a little repetitive. When you hol d something, it’s probably going to be in your hand, but we use that expression in Engl ish to give more emphasis, to make it seem more dramatic. “I hold in my hand the winning lottery ticket.” Well, not really, but that would be an example of using “ in my hand” to give more drama to an announcement.

The high school reunion, we already talked about, is a meeting or a gathering of people, in this case, ten years after you graduated  from high school. And Lucy says the first thing she did was call her “oldest a nd dearest friend,” Maria. The expression “oldest and dearest” means someone who I ’ve known for many, many years and is a very, very good friend. To be a “dea r friend” (dear) means to be a very good friend. “He’s a dear friend of mine.” He’ s a very good friend of mine. It’s a little old-fashioned to say, “my dear friend .” It’s not quite as common anymore to hear that expression but “oldest and dea rest,” you will still hear, which means very good, in this case, friend. The “o ldest and dearest” would often be your “best friend.” Your “best friend,” you can guess, is the person you are closest with who is your friend.

Maria said – Lucy’s friend, Maria, said that she re ceived her invitation, and Lucy said, she was “leaning against going” “To be lean a gainst something” means you haven’t made a decision, you’re not sure if it’s go ing to be yes or no but your thinking is going towards a certain direction. “I’m  thinking about not going.” “I’m leaning against not going, but I haven’t made a fin al decision.” Lucy says, “After

all, why live in the past?” meaning why re-live or live again those old memories? Why think about what happened in the past? Maria co nvinced her, however, that it would be a “trip” to see some of their old frien ds and to find out what had become of them. The expression, “It’s a trip” (trip ), or, “It would be a trip,” is an informal expression for mostly younger people and it means it would be a lot of fun. It would be very exciting or very interesting.  Sometimes, we use the expression also to mean something incredible, somet hing unexpected. “I was in the grocery store yesterday and I saw Tom Cruise, the movie star,” and someone else would say, “Wow, that’s a trip,” meaning that must have been amazing or interesting.

The expression “What had become of them” – Maria sa ys they can find out “what had become” of their friends. To say or to ask “Wha t had become of someone” means what happened to them. You haven’t heard abou t them or seen them in a long time and you don’t know what has happened to them, and that was when you would use this expression “what has become of.”  “What became of my old friend John? Did he go to college? Did he get a job ?” That’s the use of the expression, “what became of someone.”

Lucy says that “At the very least,” she and Maria w ould get a chance to see each other and to “talk about old times.” “At the very l east” here means even if nothing else interesting happens, even if none of the other  things that they are expecting or hoping for happens, they will be able to do this , and it’s sort of another way of saying, the minimum, the very least that can happen , and if you think perhaps, that not everything that you plan on happening will  happen, you might use this expression. “I’m going to go to the beach today and  I want to swim but at the very least, I want to get a suntan.” So, even if I don’t  swim, I’ll be able to do this. “Old times” – the expression “to talk about old times” s imply means the past.

The final part of the story is Lucy talking about s omeone at the reunion that she wants to see. This happens to be someone named “Jef f McQuillan.” I don’t know him personally. Lucy says he was a “senior” while s he was a “sophomore” and you probably know in American high schools and coll eges, the first year – there are four years – the first year is the “freshman,” the second year is the “sophomore,” the third year is the “junior,” and the final year is the “senior” year, so someone who’s in their final year would be calle d a “senior” and someone in their “sophomore” year is obviously in their second  year. Lucy said that she had a “big crush” on him. “To have a crush on someone” me ans that you like them romantically. We usually use that expression for te enagers or children. “My niece, who’s a freshman, has a crush on a movie sta r,” meaning they like them. They’re not in love with them but they like them ro mantically, they’re attracted to them.

 Lucy says that this mysterious Jeff McQuillan was s o “cute” and was smart. too. “To be cute” here is what a girl might say about a boy or a boy on a girl. “She’s cute,” meaning she or he is attractive, good lookin g. Lucy says he was “at the top of his class.” When you say someone is at the “top of their class,” we mean they’re one of the smartest. they’re getting one of  the best grades or some of the best grades. He wasn’t, according to Lucy, the “cla ss clown.” The “class clown” – a clown, of course, is someone who dresses up in a funny suit, often with a big red nose to make children laugh, but the expression , “class clown,” describes that person, and there’s always one, who tries to make everyone laugh, who tries to be funny all the time. That’s the class clown.

Lucy said that the fictional Jeff McQuillan “had a great sense of humor,” meaning he could laugh and liked to make jokes, and was vot ed “most likely to succeed.” The expression, “most likely to succeed,” means tha the was voted most likely to be successful. In American high schools, it is comm on that they take a survey or a poll of all the senior class members before they graduate and people who vote for certain categories such as, I don’t know, best student or best looking or most athletic. It’s a very American high school – common  American high school phenomenon. I don’t know if it’s common in other co untries but – and then they take this list of people who are voted and they put  it in the school newspaper or, perhaps, put it in what we call a “yearbook.” And a  “yearbook,” all one word, “yearbook” is a book that has everyone’s picture in  it and most high schools have yearbooks. Well, “most likely to succeed” means this is the person who would probably be most successful later on in life. That’ s the idea. That was, of course, not true. Now, Lucy said that, “He never gave me a second look.” “To give someone a second look” means to pay attention to th em, to look at them. In this case, “He never gave me a second look” means he did n’t pay attention to me. He wasn’t interested in me romantically.

Well, now that we’re done with that story, let’s li sten to it again, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of story]

When I got home from work, I opened my mail. The le tter turned out to be a bombshell. I held in my hand an invitation to my 10 -year high school reunion. It was a shock because I couldn't believe it had been 10 years. The first thing I did was to call my oldest and dearest friend, Maria. We  had gone to high school together and we had been best friends.

Maria said that she had received her invitation in the mail, too. I told her that I was leaning against going. After all, why live in the past? I thought, but Maria convinced me that it would be a trip to see some of  our old friends and to find out what had become of them. At the very least, we woul d get a chance to see each other and to talk about old times.

And, Maria said, Jeff McQuillan might be there. Ah,  Jeff McQuillan. He was a senior when I was a sophomore, and I had a big crus h on him. I thought he was so cute and he was smart, too. He was at the top of  his class. He wasn't the class clown, but he had a great sense of humor and was voted most likely to succeed. He never gave me a second look, but I alwa ys made sure I sat next to him in class. I wonder what he's doing now and whet her he'll be there. Hmm, maybe this reunion will be more fun than I thought.

# Checking Into a Hotel

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 97 – Checking Into a Hotel.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 97. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today's episode is about checking into a hotel. Let ’s get started.

[start of story]

I flew into Atlanta the afternoon before a big meet ing. I hailed a taxi at the airport and told the driver the name of the hotel. I asked him how long it would take to get there. He said it would only be 20 minutes. is at back and relaxed.

We got to the hotel and the doorman helped me take my luggage to the check-in desk, where I spoke with the front desk clerk.

***

Rob: Hi, I'm checking in. The last name is Rama.

Clerk: Yes, here is your reservation. You have a st andard room reserved for two nights. Is that right?

Rob: Actually, no. It should be a suite. I had book ed a non-smoking king.

Clerk: Oh, my mistake. The reservation is for a sui te and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed. I'm sorry for the error.

Rob: That's okay. I'm here a little early. Is it po ssible to check in right now?

Clerk: Sure, that's no problem. May I have your cre dit card? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals.

Rob: Here it is.

Clerk: Okay, now if you could please verify the roo m rate here – initial next to the X and sign right here. How many keys will you need?

Rob: Oh, just one.

Clerk: Okay, you're all set. You're in room 1201. T ake the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left. Do you need any help with your bags?

Rob: No, I'm fine. Thanks.

Clerk: Enjoy your stay.

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with me saying, “I flew into Atlan ta the afternoon before a big meeting.” “To fly into” somewhere means to take an airplane to that place. “I flew into New York.” “I flew into Paris.” “I flew into H eathrow in London.” That means I've taken a plane to those places. A “big meeting”  can mean one of two things. It can mean a very important meeting. You might say, “ This is a big meeting for me,” meaning it's very important for me, important for my career. Or it can just mean a large meeting with lots of people. That woul d also be a “big meeting.”

“I hailed a taxi at the airport.” “To hail (hail) a  taxi (taxi)” means to put your arm out in order to get a taxicab to stop and pick you up. So, if you're in a big city, like New York City for example, you have to stand out in  the road and put your hand up and wave to hail a taxi. I asked the taxi driver  “how long it would take to get there.” “How long” means how much time, and the tax i driver said that “it would only be 20 minutes.”

After arriving at the hotel, “the doorman helped me  take my luggage to the check- in desk.” A “doorman” (doorman) – all one word – is  usually a man, though it doesn't necessarily have to be, who greets you at a  nice hotel and offers to help you with your luggage. “Luggage” (luggage) is what we call the bags where you keep the clothes for your trip. So, the doorman “he lped me take my luggage to the check-in desk.” The “check-in (check-in) desk” is the same as the “front desk.” It's the place where you go to register or to check in to a hotel.

I say to the woman at the check-in desk, “Hi, I’m c hecking in,” meaning “I just arrived and I want to register and go to my room.” So, the woman says, “Yes, here is your reservation,” meaning she sees, either  on the computer or on a piece of paper, the information about my reservatio n. She tells me that I have a “standard room.” A “standard room” is the regular o r most basic kind of room in a hotel. There are different types of room. There’s the standard room, and then there are, in many hotels, rooms called “suites.” A  “suite” (suite) is a bigger room, usually a nicer room, and a more expensive room.

 I tell the woman that I should have a suite reserve d for me, and then I say, “I booked a non-smoking king.” “To book” (book) means to reserve a room, or to make a reservation. “Non-smoking” means you can't s moke in the room. Most public places in the United States do not allow smo king, although most hotels still have smoking sections or smoking rooms. I asked for  a “non-smoking king.” The word “king” here refers to the size of the bed. A “ king bed,” also called a “king- size bed,” is the biggest bed.

Actually, there is a bed bigger than a regular king  bed. It's called a “California King,” and it's longer than the regular king bed. B ut a “king-size” is the biggest bed you will normally find. It sleeps two people ve ry comfortably. A smaller bed that is also good for two people is a “queen bed.” The queen is smaller than the king, and smaller than the queen bed is the “double  bed.” Two people can sleep in a double bed if they are very friendly or know e ach other really, really well.

The clerk then says, “Oh, my mistake,” meaning “I w as wrong. I made a mistake.” She then asks me for a credit card. She says they n eed “a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals.” To have somethi ng “on file” means to have a record of it; in this case, they need to have your credit card on file so they know what the credit card number is in case, for example , you leave without paying your bill. If you have your credit card on file, th en they have the number and can still charge.

She mentions “room charges and incidentals.” “Room charges” are the amount that it costs you to rent the room, and “incidental s” (incidentals) are all the other things that you pay for to use in a hotel room. So,  for example, a call on the telephone in your hotel room is an incidental. In m any hotels, each call on the telephone is 50 cents or a dollar. They will charge  you even when it's what we call a “local call,” which is a call within the sam e city.

Another incidental would be the room’s minibar. In some hotels, they have what's called a “minibar” (minibar), which is a small refr igerator that has food and drinks in it. Every day, the maid – the person who comes to clean your room – checks the minibar, and if you've taken something out, she  marks that down on a piece of paper, and then when you check out, when you lea ve, you have to pay for whatever you took from the minibar. That's another example of an “incidental.”

The woman then asked me to “verify the room rate.” The “room (room) rate (rate)” is the cost of the room, the price of the r oom. She tells me to “initial the next to the X.” “To initial” (initial) something me ans to write down the first letter of your first and last names. So, for Jeff McQuillan, I would initial “JM.” Often, on

very long official forms, instead of writing your w hole name you will just write your initials. “Initial next to the X” means write your initials on the line next to a little X that is printed on the form.

Then she asked me how many keys I will need. Of cou rse, in most modern hotels, they don't actually give you a key. They gi ve you a little card that looks like a credit card, and that is your electronic key . The clerk asked me, “Do you need any help with your bags?” meaning did I want s omeone to carry my luggage to my room for me. And I say, “No, I'm fine .” “No, I'm fine,” or “No, I'm fine. Thanks,” are polite ways of saying, “No, I do n't need any help, but thank you.”

Finally the woman says, “Enjoy your stay,” meaning my stay at the hotel. The time that you will be somewhere is your “stay” (sta y). If someone asks how long is your stay, and you answer “three days,” that mea ns you will be there for three days.

Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a normal speed.

# Winter Weather

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 98: Winter Weather.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 98. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast, we’re going to talk about weather in the wintertime. Let’s get started! > I grew up in Minnesota, where the summers are hot a nd humid and winters are bitterly cold. Living in Los Angeles now, it's some times hard to describe to people how winter weather can be in chillier climates. In L.A. most of the year, the weather is sunny, clear, and warm. In one of my fav orite movies, LA Story, the weathercaster pre-recorded his weather forecasts be cause the weather was the same every day!
> Well, that's an exaggeration, because even in L.A.,  it can sometimes be quite cool in the winter and some areas around the beache s can have dense fog and occasionally drizzling. But that's nothing compared  to Minnesota. In winter, they get snow flurries and blizzards, when as much as 3 feet of snow can fall. As a kid, I would build snowmen and make angels on the g round. That part was fun but I also froze my buns off!
> And, of course, one thing that Minnesota has a lot of in the wintertime is snow. Sometimes, we get so many inches of snow, we have to shovel and plow our way out of our houses. The worst is when there is f reezing rain and sleet and the roads are slippery. Needless to say, there are a lo t of fender benders on the road with this kind of weather. Luckily, Minnesota doesn 't get any hurricanes that far north, but other parts of the country are hard hit by those every year.
> Well, I have to say that it's nice not to have to s crape ice off my windshield in the mornings, but I do miss the white Christmases.

We’re talking about winter weather in this podcast.  I begin by telling how I grew up in Minnesota and Minnesota is a state in the nor thern part of the United States – northern and middle. It has a border with Canada.  In Minnesota I said, “The summers are hot and humid and the winters are bitte rly cold.” “To be humid” (humid) – “humidity” has to do with how much water is in the air, so if it’s “humid,” there’s a lot of water in the air and it can feel –  make hot weather feel even worst. You do a lot of sweating when it’s “humid.” “To be bitterly cold in the winter” means to be extremely cold, to be very, very cold. I said I live in Los Angeles now and it’s sometimes hard to tell or describe to peop le what the weather is like in “chillier climates.” “To be chillier” means to be c older. If you say, however, “It’s chilly in here” you mean it’s cold – it’s a little cold. So, “chillier” here means “more cold.” “Climate” is just describing the weather, the type of weather that you have in a particular area. In L.A., I describe the weath er as “sunny, clear, and warm.” “Sunny,” of course, means the sun is out all the ti me. “Clear” means there are no clouds in the sky. “It’s sunny and clear;” there are no clouds, just the sun.

One of my favorite movies is “LA Story” and it’s ab out a weathercaster, someone who works on the television who tells what the weat her is going to be like. This weathercaster falls in love, of course, with a beau tiful woman and it’s a very good movie about Los Angeles and the people who live her e. The weathercaster “pre- records” his weather forecast. “To pre-record” mean s you record in advance. It’s not live. Normally, of course, television broadcast s – the news, for example, is live. The person is talking at the same time that y ou are watching it. “To pre- record” is to record something before that, and bec ause the weather is always the same in Los Angeles, the joke in the movie was that you could record the weather forecast in advance, “pre-record” them and not have to be in the studio. A “forecast” is, of course, is a prediction about w hat the weather is going to be like, the “weather forecast.”

I said that even in L.A., it could be quite cool in  the winter and the beaches can have “dense fog” and occasionally “drizzling.” “Coo l,” you know already as being lower temperature. “Fog” is when you have -- it’s b asically like a cloud on the ground and it’s water, lots of water, in the air, s o much so that you can’t see. A “dense fog” is the same as a “thick fog,” meaning it’s very heavy. it’s very difficult to see more than a few feet, That would be a “dense  (dense) fog (fog).” “Drizzling” – “to drizzle” means it is raining but it is raining very lightly, so a light rain, not a lot of rain coming down, would be a “dr izzle” as a noun or “to drizzle” as a verb. “Drizzle” is spelled (drizzle).

In Minnesota, however, in the wintertime, we get “s now flurries and blizzards”. A “snow flurry” is when the snow is falling but there ’s also some wind and so it’s a little difficult to see when you have snow flurries . A “flurry” is (flurry) and the

plural, we normally use the plural in talking about  weather, “flurries” is (flurries). A “blizzard” (blizzard) is when there is so much snow  – so much snow that you can barely see in front of you, so a lot of snow – it’s  a “snow storm” really, with lots of wind and snow coming down. I said that as a kid, I would build “snowmen” and make “angels” on the ground. A “snowman,” you proba bly know, is when you take snow, when you roll it up, usually into two or  three big balls, a big ball, a medium ball and a small ball, and the small ball on  top is the head of the snowman and you put things like a carrot to make the nose and something dark, maybe some stones or something that you would put i n for the eyes and so forth, and, of course, you put a hat on top of the snowman . And we would make snowmen in Minnesota all the time. “Angels” is some thing we would do as children when it was snowing and right after it wou ld snow. Often, the children go outside and they lay down with their back against the ground and then they take their arms and their legs and they move them up and  down and what happens is you get -- if you stand up, what you see is somethi ng like an artistic angel (angel). An “angel,” of course, is a spirit, if you  will, from heaven or from above, and many times, they’re depicted or they are drawn by artists as having big arms and these big legs, so we would make something up t hat would like a typical angel picture on the ground. It was a lot of fun.

I also said that “I froze my buns off.” “To freeze your buns off” – well, first of all your “buns” (buns) is an informal slang word for yo ur bottom, your rear end, your butt (butt) what you sit on those are your “buns.” A mother who’s angry at their son or daughter might say, “Get your buns over here ,” meaning get yourself over here. The expression, “to freeze your buns off,” me ans that you’re very cold, that you’re extremely cold, not just your buns but your whole body. Anyway, in Minnesota we had so much snow, I said, that we had to “shovel and plow our way out of our houses.” “To shovel” (shovel) means – well, it’s a noun and a verb. A “shovel” is something that’s a long stick a nd at the bottom there is a piece of metal and you use a shovel to dig a hole but you  can also use a “snow shovel” to move snow out of your way. And that is a verb as  well. “To shovel” is to use the shovel. A “plow” – again, this is a noun and a verb (plow). “To plow” usually is what happens when you have a big truck and in front  of the truck, there’s a big piece of metal and that metal pushes or moves the s now off to the side of the road so that people can drive on the road. That tru ck is called a “plow,” as a noun, but the verb is “to plow,” that’s what the “p low truck” or the “plow” does.

I said that the worst in Minnesota is when there is  “freezing rain” and “sleet.” “Freezing rain” is what it sounds like. The rain co mes down but it doesn’t freeze until it hits the ground so there is all this ice o n the ground. “Sleet” is a combination of rain – freezing rain and snow. “Slee t” is spelled (sleet). I said the roads are often “slippery” when there’s a lot of sl eet. ”Slippery,” of course, means

that you can slip, that you can fall. It’s hard to stand up or it’s hard for cars to stop because they slip on the ice. “Needless to say,” I said, meaning it’s obvious. “Needless to say,” obviously, “there are a lot of f ender benders on the road.” A “fender” (fender) is the front part of your car. It ’s like – sometimes called close to the bumper, the very front of the car, and if you h it another car, you have a car accident, you’re probably going to damage the fende r. And a small car accident is called a “fender bender” (bender), two words, “f ender,” “bender.” It means a small car accident, not a serious one.

I said Minnesota doesn’t get any “hurricanes” and a  “hurricane” is what they call, in some places, a typhoon. A “hurricane” is a large  storm and we unfortunately had a couple of big hurricanes here in the United S tates recently, in New Orleans, for example. I said that some parts of the  country are “hard hit” by hurricanes every year. “To be hard hit” means that they are seriously affected that they cause a lot of damage – “To be hard hit.”  Finally, I said that, “I am glad I don’t have to scrape ice off my windshield.” “To sc rape ice” is when it’s cold, and there’s -- particularly when there’s freezing rain,  there’s going to be ice on your car. And the front part of your car, the window -- the front window of your car that you look out of is called “the windshield,” all one  word, “windshield.” And you, of course, have to take a piece of plastic or metal an d you have to get rid of the ice and that would be “to scrape,” to remove something that is very strongly attached to the surface. I said that I do miss the “white Ch ristmases,” meaning the Christmas time, December 25th, when you have snow o utside. The traditional, almost romantic version of Christmas is that it’s a  “white Christmas,” and that’s the kind of popular image of Christmas. Of course, in Los Angeles, we don’t have any white Christmases.

Now let’s listen to the story again this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of story]

I grew up in Minnesota, where the summers are hot a nd humid and winters are bitterly cold. Living in Los Angeles now, it's some times hard to describe to people how winter weather can be in chillier climates. In L.A. most of the year, the weather is sunny, clear, and warm.

# Sitcoms and Game Shows

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 99: Sitcoms and Game Shows.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 99. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan from the Center for Educational Deve lopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about televisions sh ows. We’re going to be talking about game shows and comedies on American Televisio n. Let’s get started! > When I want to kick back and relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what's on. Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the coasts in the Un ited States, but there are plenty of reruns and shows in syndication between the time I get home from work at five and eight o’clock. I like to watch quiz sho ws like Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? I actually tried out once to b e on Jeopardy, thinking I could be the next Ken Jennings! But I didn't pass the test. So much for trivia.
> The national news is on at 6:30 in L.A., and there is lots of local news before and after that. Between six and seven there are Hollywo od gossip shows like Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight, as well as som e sitcoms. One of my favorites is Seinfeld, the ultimate comedy program about nothing. Of course, there are some old favorites, too, such as MASH and  Friends. When I'm feeling really bored or really desperate‚ I'll turn on Whee l of Fortune and watch somebody buy a vowel.

We are talking about popular American television in  this podcast and I began the story by saying that, “When I want to kick back and  relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what’s on.” Couple of expressions there – “ to kick back,” two words – “to kick back” means, really, the same as relax, just s it down, not to do anything very difficult. “To flip on” (flip) (on) – “to flip on the TV” means simply to turn it on, two separate words “flip on,” and “to see what’s on” me ans simply to see what programs are currently showing on television. Someo ne might ask, “What’s on TV tonight?” – meaning what programs are showing to night.

I said that, “Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the co asts in the United States.” “Primetime” (primetime) is the time when the new sh ows, the most current programs, comedies, and dramas, are on. “Primetime”  in the United States is usually three hours long every night and that’s whe re the most important or most popular television programs are shown. “On the coas ts,” that is, on the west coast of the United States, Los Angeles, San Franci sco, San Diego etc., and on the “East coast” of the United States, New York, Wa shington, Boston, Atlanta, the primetime or most important shows are on betwee n 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM. In the middle of the United States, in the central part of the United States, primetime is usually on at 7:00 PM – from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, but here in Los Angeles, it begins at 8 o’clock. And I said that ev en before that, there are plenty of “reruns and shows in syndication.” A “rerun,” al l one word, (rerun) is a program – a television program that has been on before but now it’s being shown again. Sometimes it could be three, four, or even five yea rs old but they’re still showing those same programs. “To rerun” means, of course, to run it again or to show it again. When we say a show is in “syndication,” we m ean that this is a program -- a television program that individual television sta tions across the country have bought, have purchased in order to show on their st ation. The opposite of “syndication” or “syndicated programs” would be “ne twork programs,” and “network” (network) – “network programs” are one of  the programs that come from the five major companies – five major networks  in the United States.

I said I liked to watch “quiz shows.” A “quiz (quiz ) show” is a show where they ask questions about some general knowledge topic, h istory or politics, and people try to answer the fastest and the get points  or money if they answer the questions correctly. Two of the most popular that h ave been around for many years – one is called “Jeopardy.” “Jeopardy” has be en around for 20, 25 years, perhaps more, and it’s a daily program, 30 minutes,  where host of the program – Alex Trebek is his name – he asks questions for – there are three different people. Now, the interesting thing about jeopardy is that he doesn’t actually ask a question, he gives an answer and then you, as the p erson playing the game, have to ask a question so, for example the answer h e will show you is “Sacramento” and the question would be, “What is the capital of California?”

“Who Wants to be a Millionaire” is more traditional  – a traditional game show where one person asks a question and there’s only o ne person that -- who is playing the game. They’re not competing against or playing against anyone else and each question gets more and more difficult unti l the most difficult questions, if they get them right – all the other ones right, is worth a million dollars. Very few people a million dollars on “Who wants to be a Mill ionaire.”

I mentioned that I “tried out” to be on Jeopardy. “ To try out,” two words (try out) – “to try out” means that I wanted to be on the progr am and so I went and I took a test to see if I could be on the program. “To try o ut” as a verb, in general, means whenever you want to be part of – usually a team, s ometimes it may be a play, for example, and I’m trying out for the part of Ham let, Shakespeare’s Hamlet – means I go to the theater and I do some acting and see if they’ll select me to be the person who plays Hamlet. Well, you can try out for a sports team, you can try out for a play. I tried out for the game show, the quiz show, “Jeopardy,” thinking I could be “the next Ken Jennings.” “Ken Jennings” is  a person who won, I think, 2.5 million dollars on the game show “Jeopardy.” He  was on for weeks and weeks.

Well, I didn’t pass the test and I said, “So much f or trivia.” The expression, “So much for,” means that we’ve given up on it, we’ve no longer have any hope for it. You may hear someone say, “Well, I went to the stor e and they didn’t have what I wanted. So much for that,” meaning I’ve given up. I  don’t want to do that again. “So much for trivia.” “Trivia” (trivia) – “trivia” is small facts, little facts, not very important, knowing the capitals of all the 50 state s in the United States would be “trivia.” I said that the national news comes on at  6:30 here in Los Angeles and each of the major networks – well, at least three of the five major networks have a national news show that is 30 minutes long every night. There’s also, of course, local news programs, “local news” here in Los Angel es and in most cities in the United States.

Between 6 and 7 at night here in Los Angeles, there  are Hollywood gossip shows on. “To gossip” (gossip) means to talk about other people, usually something about their private life, and Hollywood gossip show s, of course, would talk about famous stars, famous movie stars, and television st ars. The two shows that are most popular that have been around for many years o n American television are “Access Hollywood” and “Entertainment Tonight.” The re are also some “sitcoms” on during the 7 to 8 o’clock hour. A “sitcom” (sitc om) stands for “situation comedy” and it’s a comedy show that has some sort of story. Usually we’re following a group of people, for example, the famou s sitcom from the 1990’s was “Friends” and “Friends” was about 6 young people li ving in New York City and that was a comedy show. That was a sitcom. One of the most famous sitcoms from the 1990’s that is very popular still in the U nited States is called “Seinfeld,” and Seinfeld was the name of the star of the show a nd it was a show about four people – single people living also in New York – Ne w York City, and the famous joke on the show was that it was “a show about noth ing,” meaning there wasn’t any strong theme of the show. It was just about the  lives of these four people, and it was a very popular, very funny comedy show.

The other comedy shows that are popular or have bee n popular include “Friends,” which is also in other countries, in oth er languages. It’s been translated. You might have seen “Friends” in your o wn country. And the one that was very popular in the 1980’s is called “MASH” (ma sh). “MASH” was a show about doctors during the Korean War. It’s kind of a  strange situation to have a comedy about but it was a very, very popular show i n the 1970’s and 80’s, but people still watch the show in “reruns,” meaning ma ny television stations still show these programs like “Seinfeld,” “Friends,” and  “MASH” even though they are no longer making new shows or new episodes. is aid when I feel really bored or really “desperate” – “to be desperate” means tha t you’ve done everything else you can do and you have no other choices, no other options. When you’re desperate – when I’m desperate I turn on “Wheel of Fortune.” “Wheel of Fortune” is another quiz show. It’s a game show where they s pin a big wheel and the wheel has different amounts of money on it and the game is to guess a bunch of words, usually an expression or a phrase, but they only give you one letter at a time and you have to guess what the word is. I don’ t really like it very much but it has been popular for 15, 20 years in the United Sta tes. One of the things they do on the show is you can guess any sort of consonant but if you want a vowel, you have to take some of the money you have won and “bu y a vowel.” So, I say at the end of the story, “I watch somebody buy a vowel ” because that’s something that’s always happening on the show. Someone will b uy an “A,” an “E,” an “I,” an “O,” or a “U” so they can help them guess what the word is. I’m very bad at that sort of game which is probably why I don’t like it.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at native r ate of speech.

When I want to kick back and relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what's on. Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the coasts in the Un ited States, but there are plenty of reruns and shows in syndication between the time I get home from work at five and eight o’clock. I like to watch quiz sho ws like Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? I actually tried out once to b e on Jeopardy, thinking I could be the next Ken Jennings! But I didn't pass the test. So much for trivia.

The national news is on at 6:30 in L.A., and there is lots of local news before and after that. Between six and seven there are Hollywo od gossip shows like Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight, as well as som e sitcoms. One of my favorites is Seinfeld, the ultimate comedy program about nothing. Of course, there are some old favorites, too, such as MASH and  Friends. When I'm feeling really bored or really desperate‚ I'll turn on Whee l of Fortune and watch somebody buy a vowel.

# Making Unkind Comments

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 100.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  100. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today we are going to talk about saying unkind or n ot nice things about another person and how we react to that. Let’s get started!  > Yesterday, I was talking to an ex-colleague of mine  who, frankly, has something of a big mouth. I bumped into him at the beach, whe re he was walking his dog. Anyway, as I was saying, he's the kind of guy that' s always bad mouthing his co- workers. So he came up to me and said, "Hey, Jeff. Long time, no see. What've you been up to?" "Ah, not much, " I said. "Well, gu ess who I saw yesterday? John Robeson, the guy from accounting at Firth Indu stries. You remember him, the guy with big ears and and an ego to match." “It  takes one to know one,” I thought, but I kept it to myself. "Oh, really? How interesting," I replied.
> "Yeah, well, I hate to talk behind someone's back, but ever since he and I had that falling out last year, I've never really cared  for the guy." "How come?" I asked. "Well, he's a bit of a backstabber, always t rying to outdo the other guy." "I know what you mean," I said. I knew at this point it was time to make my exit, otherwise, this guy would go on about John Robeson for the next 10 minutes.
> "What time do you have?" I asked him. "It's quarter  after five." "Geez, already? Man, I've got to hit the road. I'm suppose d to meet my brother at the pier in a few minutes. But, hey, it was sure go od to see you again. You take care!" With that, I made my exit. I've got better t hings to do than to listen to him gripe all day.

In my story, I said that “I was talking to an ex-co lleague of mine,” and “colleague” is someone usually that you work with or that is in  the same profession or the same occupation as you are. An “ex-colleague” here would mean someone that I use to work with. I said that “Quite frankly, he ha s something of a big mouth.” “Quite frankly” means quite honestly – to be very h onest. “To be frank” means to be honest. I said he had a “big mouth.” To say some one has a “big mouth” is

something of an insult. It means that they talk too  much, that they’re always telling things to other people, that they should no t. I said I “bumped into him at the beach.” “To bump into” means to meet someone th at you were not expecting to meet. It is similar to “I ran into.” “I ran into  my friend at the supermarket.” I wasn’t expecting or planning to see him there but there he was.

My friend was “walking his dog.” “To walk your dog”  of course, means to take your dog outside so the dog can well, do his busine ss, let’s say. I said that “my friend is the kind of guy who is always bad mouthin g his co-workers.” “To bad mouth” means to say bad things about another person . “Don’t bad mouth your friend” meaning – means don’t say unkind or un-nice  things about your friend.

“Co-workers” is the same as colleagues, someone tha t you work with. I said that my friend “comes up” to me. He comes up to me and s ays – to “come up to someone” means to approach someone – he says to me,  “Long time, no see.” This is a common expression that we often use. It’s  an informal expression which means “it’s been a long time since I have seen you. ” “Long time no see” – you say that to someone you have not seen in a long tim e. He told me that he saw a mutual - or someone that we both know – friend, Joh n Robeson, and he said, insulting John, that he had “big ears and an ego to  match.” Well, an “ego” – your ego is, of course, your pride. Your ego is how you feel about yourself. When someone has a “big ego,” they think they’re very im portant. To say someone has an “ego to match” – “to match” means the same as, the same size as or the same amount as. He said – my friend said that “the guy has big ears and an ego to match” meaning his ego is also big.

I thought to myself, “it takes one to know one.” “I t takes one to know one” is another expression just like “Long time, no see” – very common in American English. “It takes one to know one” means when some one says something unkind - not nice – about another person, we someti mes say, if that same person has those same negative or unkind qualities, “it ta kes one to know one” – for example, someone who has a big ego who complains ab out another person with a big ego. “Well, it takes one to know one.” You ha ve to be something in order to recognize it in someone else.

My friend said that he “hated to talk behind someon e’s back.” “To talk behind someone’s back” means to say un-nice, again unkind things, not nice things about someone when they are not present – when they  are not there.

He, my former colleague, my ex-colleague said that he and Jon Robeson had a “falling out” last year. A “falling out” means an a rgument – a fight, not necessarily a physical fight, but when you have a disagreement with someone and that

disagreement causes you to not talk to each other. “My friend and I had a falling out over who was going to pay for dinner last night .” You often – we often say we have a “falling out” over some problem.

My friend says that he “never really cared for John  Robeson.” “To care for someone,” of course, means to like someone in this case. “To care for” also means “to help,” “to assist,” but here it just mean s to like. “How come?” I asked, meaning “why?” “How come, why?” - it’s an informal way of asking why. Well, my friend said “He’s a bit of a back stabber.” A “back  stabber” – “to stab” means to take usually a knife and put it into something. “To  stab someone” means to take a knife and put it into them. A “back stabber” woul d be somebody who attacks you without you having a chance to defend yourself.  It’s very closely related to the expression “to talk behind someone’s back.” A “ back stabber” is someone who does something not nice, something unkind to yo u behind your back, meaning without you knowing.

According to my ex-colleague, John Robeson was alwa ys trying to “outdo” the other guy. “To outdo” means to do better than the o ther person. I said “At this point, I needed to make my exit.” “To exit,” of cou rse, means to leave. “To make your exit” means to leave. It means the same as exi t – to make my exit. It comes – the expression probably comes from the theater, f rom someone on a play – in a play rather, making their exit – meaning they lea ve the stage, the leave off where people can see them.

I said my ex-colleague would “go on about John for the next ten minutes.” “To go on about something or someone” means to talk too mu ch. “I was talking to my brother yesterday and he went on and on about his n ew car,” meaning he talked for a long time – too long of the time. I used a co uple of expressions in responding to my ex-colleague. I asked him, “What t ime do you have?” This is the same as asking someone “What time is it?” It’s a little bit more polite. If you come up to a stranger or someone that you do not kn ow and you say, “Excuse me, what time is it?” -  that’s okay but a little m ore polite way would be to say, “Excuse me, can you tell me what time you have?” He re I just said, “What time do you have?” meaning could you tell me the time. A fter I was told the time, I said “Geez, already?” “Geez” (geez) is an informal way of saying, “Wow!” I also said, “Man I’ve got to hit the road.” “Man” here is  again informal. It just is an expression of excitement or it means the same as – sometimes we say, “Boy!” “Boy! I’ve got to hit the road.” It just emphasizes  that you have to do that particular thing. The thing I had to do was “to hit  the road.” “To hit the road” means to leave, to go somewhere. “What time are we going to hit the road?” “Well, we’ll probably leave at 7pm.” The pier – is aid I was meeting my brother at

the “pier.” The “pier” – a pier is (pier) something  that goes out into the ocean from the beach. It’s usually made of word and people can  walk out onto the pier.

I told my ex colleague that it was “sure good” to s ee him again. This is a common way of saying goodbye to someone after or someone t hat we haven’t seen in a long time. “It’s sure good to see you again,” means  it’s nice to see you again. I told him to “take care” – that is “to take care” of  himself. Again, a very common expression – “You take care!” means I hope that eve rything goes well for you, that you take care of yourself. I wanted to leave b ecause I didn’t want to hear my friend “gripe” all day. “To gripe” (gripe) means to  complain. It’s a somewhat informal expression meaning, “to complain.”

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal rate of speech.
