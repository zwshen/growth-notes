This episode is about a man and a woman. The man is  going to be chivalrous, or at least that's what we hope. Let’s get started. > When I first met Lance, I thought he was the perfec t guy.  He was a real gentleman.  He opened doors for me and pulled out m y chair in restaurants.  He was as chivalrous as they come.  But after a while,  I realized that he took chivalry a little too far. ...
> Lance:  Let me carry that box for you.
> Guinevere:  No, that’s okay.  It’s not heavy.
> Lance:  It doesn’t matter.  I’m your boyfriend and I can’t have you carrying a box when my hands are free.
> Guinevere:  Is that some kind of code of conduct I don’t know about?
> Lance:  It’s how a knight would treat his lady.
> Guinevere:  That’s nice, but I’m perfectly capable of carrying my own box, thank you.
> Lance:  Don’t argue.  It’s my duty to show every co urtesy to my girlfriend, so give me that box.
> Guinevere:  Are you saying that your code of conduc t takes precedence over my preferences?
> Our story begins with Guinevere telling us about ho w she met this man by the name of Lance. She says, “When I first met Lance” –  when I met him the first time – “I thought he was the perfect guy” – the per fect man, the perfect person. “Guy” here would probably refer to a man, however. Sometimes, people will use “guys” in the plural to mean both men and women, bu t when it's singular, it's usually a man, I think.

Anyway, Guinevere says that this Lance was a real g entleman. A “gentleman” (gentleman) is a man who behaves well, who acts nic e, especially with women. A man who has good manners could be called a gentlema n. “Lance opened doors for me and pulled out my chair in restaurants.” The se are two things that traditionally gentlemen – men with good manners – a re supposed to do. If you are walking into a building and there is a woman wi th you, as the man, you are supposed to open the door and let her walk in first . Similarly, if you are sitting down at a restaurant somewhere, or sitting down to eat, the man will go over and pulled the chair out to make it easier for the woma n to sit down so the woman doesn't have to pull her own chair out. That's what  Lance did with Guinevere when they first were dating, when they first were g oing out as a romantic couple.

“Lance,” Guinevere tells us, “was as chivalrous as they come.” “Chivalrous” (chivalrous) is similar to being a gentleman. It me ans to be courteous. It means to be well mannered. It means to pay special attent ion to being nice to women. “Chivalrous” is an adjective. “Gentleman” is a noun . The two are related, however. We describe a man who acts like a gentlema n as being chivalrous, especially when we're talking about how that man tr eats or acts toward women. Guinevere says, “He was as chivalrous as they come. ” The expression “as they come” means more than other people, or simply very much. “He's as rich as they come” would mean he is one of the richest people yo u will ever know. He's very rich.

“Lance was as chivalrous as they come. But after a while,” Guinevere says, “I realized that he took his chivalry a little too far .” “To take something too far” means to do too much of something or to go to such an extreme that now it's

almost a bad thing. You're doing it too much. “Chiv alry” is the noun related to the adjective “chivalrous.” Well, Lance apparently is t aking his chivalry too far.

We begin then with the dialogue. Lance says to Guin evere, “Let me carry that box for you.” That might be another thing the gentl eman might do for a woman – carry her bags or carry her things that are heavy.

Guinevere says, “No, that's okay. It's not heavy.” Lance says, “It doesn't matter.” That's not important. “I'm your boyfriend and I can 't have you carrying a box when my hands are free.” The expression “to have yo ur hands free” means that you're not holding anything, that you can use your hands to do something, in this case, to help carry the box. Guinevere says, “Is th at some kind of code of conduct I don't know about?” A “code” (code) is a s et of rules or laws. “Conduct” (conduct) is how you act. A “code of conduct” would  be rules for how you act, especially formal rules that some organization, per haps, creates. Guinevere is asking if what Lance wants to do is part of some ki nd of, or some variety of code of conduct.

Lance says, “It's how a knight would treat his lady .” A “knight” (knight) is a title of honor that is given to a man by the king or the que en. In the United States, we don't have a king or queen so we don't have knights . But, for example, in Great Britain, in the United Kingdom, there is a queen wh o makes some men, anyway, knights – people with a lot of power, a lot of infl uence. Important people are often knighted. We can even use that word as a verb, “to knight.” The term “lady” (lady) here means a woman with good manners, a woman with grace, a woman who is considered to be well behaved, well mannered.

Guinevere says, “That's nice, but I'm perfectly cap able of carrying my own box. Thank you.” “To be capable,” (capable) means to hav e the ability, to have the skills, or the knowledge to do something. “To be pe rfectly capable,” means you are completely capable. “Perfectly” is just a word to emphasize. It's sort of like “very” capable.

Lance says, “Don't argue. It's my duty to show ever y courtesy to my girlfriend so give me that box.” Lance is telling Guinevere not to disagree with him. “Don't argue.” Lance hasn’t been a boyfriend very long. Yo u got a lot to learn, Lance, let me tell you. Anyway, Guinevere says she's perfectly  capable of carrying her own box but Lance says that it's his “duty” (duty) to s how every “courtesy” (courtesy) to his girlfriend. Your “duty” is your obligation, your responsibility, the thing you are supposed to do. “Courtesy” is something that is  nice, something that is polite that you do to show your respect to someone, to sho w that you are well behaved,

that you have good manners. “Courtesy” is a noun th at describes those activities or those actions.

Guinevere says, “Are you saying that your code of c onduct takes precedence over my preferences?” “To take precedence (preceden ce) over something” means to be more important than something, to come before something. You should never let your job, your work, take preceden ce over your family. It should never be more important than your family.

Guinevere is asking if Lance’s code of conduct, his  rules for chivalry, take precedence over her preferences. Lance says, “No, I 'm just telling you that my job is to help and protect you even if it's against  your will.” “To protect someone” means to keep them safe, to make sure that nothing bad happens to them. “To do something against your will” means the opposite of what you want. “He did it against his will.” That means he didn't really want  to do it but he did it anyway. Lance is saying that it is his duty to protect Guin evere even if Guinevere doesn't want him to.

Guinevere ends our story by saying, “How can you ar gue with that logic?” “Logic (logic) is thinking, usually thinking in a rational , intelligent way. In some cases, it means following certain formal rules of reasoning, of thinking, of logic. We think about Aristotle and his writings about logic. In th is case, Guinevere is saying that it's difficult to try to convince Lance that he's w rong because he has this set of reasons that don't seem to allow for anyone to diff er with him. That's why she says, “How can you argue with that logic?” Sometime s we might say that when we think the person is correct and they are saying something we agree with – sometimes we might say this expression or use this expression when we think the person’s ideas are a little crazy and there is no way we could agree with them. It can have opposite meanings. I'm not sure w hich meaning it has for Guinevere.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of story]

When I first met Lance, I thought he was the perfec t guy.  He was a real gentleman.  He opened doors for me and pulled out m y chair in restaurants.  He was as chivalrous as they come.  But after a while,  I realized that he took chivalry a little too far. ...

Lance:  Let me carry that box for you.

 Guinevere:  No, that’s okay.  It’s not heavy.

Lance:  It doesn’t matter.  I’m your boyfriend and I can’t have you carrying a box when my hands are free.

Guinevere:  Is that some kind of code of conduct I don’t know about?

Lance:  It’s how a knight would treat his lady.

Guinevere:  That’s nice, but I’m perfectly capable of carrying my own box, thank you.

Lance:  Don’t argue.  It’s my duty to show every co urtesy to my girlfriend, so give me that box.

Guinevere:  Are you saying that your code of conduc t takes precedence over my preferences?

Lance:  No, I’m just telling you that my job is to help and protect you, even if it’s against your will. ...

How can you argue with that logic?

This episode is a story about listening to the traf fic report – a report about how the traffic is on the freeways and roads in your ci ty. Let's get started.  > Every afternoon before I leave work, I listen to the traffic report to see if I should take my usual route home or make a detour.  So toda y, like every day, I turned on my radio.
> “It’s a tough commute today if you’re traveling on I-35 north.  There’s a major slowdown due to an overturned big rig that’s blocki ng the number two lane.”
> Oh no.  That meant that I had to take the 40W inste ad.
> “If you’re traveling on the 40W, you’ll find a lot of congestion. It’s down to one lane because of a pileup.  Emergency vehicles are r esponding.”
> Wow, that meant I might have to take surface street s all the way home.
> “And if you’re thinking of taking Broadway Boulevar d west from downtown, think again.  There is a stalled vehicle blocking the rig ht lane and construction all the way to Main Street.”
> Well, I was in a no-win situation.  Do I want to sp end two hours in gridlock or two more hours at work?

Our story begins when I say that every afternoon be fore I leave work, before I leave my job, I listen to the traffic report. The “ traffic report” is information about

how fast cars are moving on different streets and f reeways. Usually, people listen to the traffic report on the radio in their car. Th ey turn on the radio and there are certain radio stations that frequently give you a t raffic report. Here in Los Angeles, because traffic is always so bad, because we have so many cars, there are a couple of stations that give traffic reports every five to 10 minutes throughout the entire day. So, within five or 10 mi nutes of getting in your car, you can hear what the road conditions are. That is how much traffic there is on the road.

I said that, “I listen to the traffic report to see  if I should take my usual route home” – my usual way of going from my office to my home – “or make a detour.” A “detour” (detour) is when you go a different way than you would normally go, either because there are problems on the road – the re's a lot of traffic, for example – or because the road is closed due to cons truction, because they're fixing or building it. You can't drive on it, so yo u have to take a detour. You have to take another road that will get you to the same place although, usually, it will take longer. I say that “Today, like every day, I t urned on my radio.”

Next, we hear the voice of the person who is giving  the traffic report. I've always wanted to be the person on the radio giving the tra ffic report. Maybe someday I will be able to get that job. It's kind of an inter esting job here in Los Angeles because the traffic reporters – the people who tell  you how the traffic is doing – often are in helicopters and they’re flying around the city looking down at the freeways and the streets to see how the traffic is doing, whether it is crowded or not. So, it's kind of an exciting job, at least her e in Los Angeles.

The traffic reporter says, “It's a tough” – or diff icult – “commute today if you're traveling on I-35 North.” Your “commute” (commute) is the trip between your home and your office, and your office and your home . That time traveling, that act of traveling, typically in a car, is what we ca ll your “commute.” “It's a tough commute,” the announcer, the reporter says, “if you 're traveling” – if you are going on – “I-35 North.” The “I” stands for “inters tate.” In the United States, we have the most important, the largest highways and f reeways as part of something called the interstate highway system. I-35 North wo uld be a freeway that I just happen to know, runs in the middle of the United St ates through my home state of Minnesota. I-35 North would be the people who we re traveling north on that road.

The traffic announcer says there is a major, or a very serious – important – slowdown. A “slowdown” – one word – is a situation where the cars are slowing down but they're not stopped completely. They're st ill moving, but they're going more slowly than they normally would. I say there is a major slowdown due to, or

because of, an overturned big rig. “To overturn som ething” is to flip it over, to make the bottom be facing the top, and the top faci ng the bottom. “Overturned,” when used in describing a car or a vehicle, means the car or the truck has turned over, and now it is upside down. A “big rig” (rig) is a large truck. It's an informal word we use to describe a very large truck that wou ld, for example, carry things from one city to another. It’s a very long truck. I f the big rig overturned, that would be very serious because, of course, it's a very big  truck and it probably would cause problems for people trying to drive on the ro ad. In fact, this big rig is blocking the number two lane.

“To block” (block) means not allow someone access, not allow someone to go through a certain area. If the truck is blocking tr affic, it's preventing other cars from driving through that area. The truck is blocki ng the number two lane. A “lane” (lane) is the area on a freeway or a road wh ere the car drives. Some freeways, most freeways, have more than one lane go ing in each direction so you can have two cars traveling side-by-side, next to each other, going in the same direction. In Los Angeles, some of our freeway s have four, five or even six lanes of cars – six lines of cars – going in the sa me direction. In many cities, at least here in Los Angeles, the traffic reporters wi ll number the lanes so you'll know which lane they’re talking about. The number o ne lane is the lane that is farthest to the left as you drive down the freeway.  That's the lane where people go fast. So, if you don't want to go fast, you shou ld not be in the number one lane. The number two lane, then, would be the lane next to the number one lane, to the right of the number one lane, and then, of c ourse, number three, number four, and so forth, depending on their position on the freeway. So, this overturned big rig is blocking the number two lane. It's block ing part of the freeway.

I then say, “Oh no. That meant that I had to take the 40W instead.” I had to take another freeway. But then we hear the traffic repor ter again telling us about the problems on the other freeway, on the 40W. He says,  “If you're traveling on the 40W, you'll find a lot of congestion.” “Congestion”  is traffic that's moving very slowly, cars that are moving very slowly. The repor ters says that “its” – meaning the freeway – “it's down to one lane because of a p ileup.” “To be down to,” means that it has been reduced to. It has been lowe red to that number. You might say, if you only have one dollar left in your  pocket, “I'm down to one dollar,” meaning the amount of money I have has been reduced  to one dollar. I spent all the rest of it buying coffee at Starbucks, or where ver. The freeway is down to one lane because of a “pileup.” A “pileup” (pileup) – o ne word – is a crash involving more than two cars or more than two vehicles. A pil eup would be three or more cars that have hit each other on the freeway or on a road somewhere, and are blocking other people from driving by, or at least that's what typically happens.

The traffic reporter says that, “Emergency vehicles  are responding.” “Emergency vehicles” refers to a police car, an ambulance – for people who are injured – or a fire truck, if there's a fire. All of those are eme rgency vehicles – a police car, an ambulance, or fire truck. When we say the emergency  vehicles are responding, we mean they're actually going to the scene, the pl ace where the accident is, in order to help. We talk about responders being peopl e who, in an emergency, are the first to go and help – the police men and women , the firemen and women, and so forth.

I then say, “Wow. That meant I might have to take s urface streets all the way home.” Because the two freeways are congested, I say that I might have to take surface streets. “Surface (surface) streets” are an y roads, any boulevards, any streets in a city, not including freeways, highways , and expressways. Those three words all mean the same thing, really. “Surfa ce streets” is anything but the freeway. It's all of the other streets, not includi ng the freeway or the highway.

The traffic report’s final announcement is that, “I f you're thinking of taking,” of driving on, “Broadway Boulevard west of downtown, t hink again,” meaning you should reconsider your plans. You should come up wi th a better idea – “think again.” “There is a stalled vehicle blocking the ri ght lane.” “Stalled” (stalled) is an adjective we use to describe a car that won't move because of some mechanical problem. That's a stalled car. In this case, there is a stalled vehicle, which is just a more general word for car or a truck, blocking the right lane and construction all the way to Main Street. “Construction” here means they are building a new road or fixing the road and you can't drive on it.

“Well,” I said, “I was in a no-win situation.” A “n o-win situation” is a situation where no matter what happens, it's going to be bad.  It's a situation where regardless of the decision you make, something bad will happen. I say, “Do I want to spend two hours in gridlock or two more hou rs at work?” “Gridlock” (gridlock) is a situation where there are so many c ars that nobody can move or it seems like nobody can move. The cars are all stoppe d because there are too many cars on the road. That's “gridlock.” If I go h ome now, I'm going to be on the road for two hours before I get home. The other opt ion is to stay at work and work later waiting for the traffic to die down, to reduce, to be less of a problem. Neither of those are very good options for me, and that's why I say, “This is a no- win situation.”

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Every afternoon before I leave work, I listen to the traffic report to see if I should take my usual route home or make a detour.  So toda y, like every day, I turned on my radio.

“It’s a tough commute today if you’re traveling on I-35 north.  There’s a major slowdown due to an overturned big rig that’s blocki ng the number two lane.”

Oh no.  That meant that I had to take the 40W inste ad.

“If you’re traveling on the 40W, you’ll find a lot of congestion. It’s down to one lane because of a pileup.  Emergency vehicles are r esponding.”

Wow, that meant I might have to take surface street s all the way home.

“And if you’re thinking of taking Broadway Boulevar d west from downtown, think again.  There is a stalled vehicle blocking the rig ht lane and construction all the way to Main Street.”

Well, I was in a no-win situation.  Do I want to sp end two hours in gridlock or two more hours at work?

She builds freeways to better English that are neve r congested, never blocked. I speak poetically of our very own Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.



# Working Overseas

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 904: Working Overseas.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 904. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to ESLPod.com and become a member of this podcas t. If you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this and all of our c urrent episodes.

This episode is a dialog about someone who will be taking the job in another country. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Danielle:  I’m so excited!  I just got my new posti ng overseas.  I can’t wait to live abroad and work as an expat.

Angus:  I remember my first overseas assignment.  I t was interesting, but the adjustment took some time.

Danielle:  I won’t have any problems.  I already ha ve my work permit and vaccinations, and I speak the language fairly well.   And remember, I don’t have any family to relocate.

Angus:  I didn’t think I’d have any problems either , but when I got to McQuillanland, I was in culture shock.

Danielle:  I’m ready for the differences in the cos t of living.  I’ll be getting a housing allowance, which will offset the increase i n living expenses.

Angus:  I wasn’t thinking so much about the expense  of living abroad.  I was referring to a different pace of life and the many cultural differences that affect every facet of life.

Danielle:  That’s what I’m looking forward to.  It’ ll all be so exciting.

Angus:  I’m glad you’re in euphoria right now, but be prepared for some bumps in the road.

Danielle:  No problem.  To me, smooth sailing would  be boring!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Danielle saying to Angus, “I 'm so excited. I just got my new posting overseas.” The word “posting” (posting)  is used for people who work in jobs that frequently require moving from one pla ce to another. A large company, for example, might have offices in many di fferent countries. So, a manager might have a posting in one country and the n a posting in another country. It's not normally used for jobs that don't  require you to move to different places, either within a country or to another count ry. So, for example, a schoolteacher probably wouldn't refer to his or her  new job as a “posting” because it doesn't involve traveling to different p arts of the world or of the country.

But Danielle obviously works for a company that req uires her to move frequently, and her new posting is overseas. “Overseas” (overse as) means in another country. A “sea” (sea) is an ocean. “Overseas” woul d be over or across an ocean. Now technically, a job would be overseas, if  you lived in the United States, if that job were in Europe, Asia, Africa, A ustralia, the Middle East, and so forth – anything that would require you to travel o ver an ocean in order to get there. Hawaii is part of the United States. So, you  wouldn't be traveling overseas if you were working in Hawaii. Overseas always refe rs to a foreign country, another country not your own. Now, many people use overseas to mean the same as the next word in our dialogue which is “abr oad.”

Danielle says, “I can't wait to live abroad.” “Abro ad” always  means in another country. “Overseas” means in another country, or it  can mean specifically, in another country that is not connected to, in this c ase, the United States. So, if you were working in Canada or Mexico, you might not  say that I'm working overseas. You might say “I'm working abroad,” but it's perfectly acceptable to use overseas, even when you don't actually have to trav el over an ocean.

Danielle says that she can't wait to live abroad, m eaning she's very excited about living abroad. She's also excited about working as an expat. An “expat” (expat) is short for “expatriate” (expatriate). An expatriate is a person who lives in a foreign country, who lives in another country, not his own.  So, if you move to the United States from another country and work here, you woul d be considered an expat. If I go to Mexico to teach English, I would be called an ex-pat.

Angus says, “I remember my first overseas assignmen t.” An “assignment” is the same as a posting. “It was interesting, but the adj ustment took some time.”

“Adjustment” is when you have to change your behavi or to adapt to a new situation, or a new environment. When you move to a  different country, there are many things that are new and so there is a period o r a time of adjustment.

Danielle says, “I won't have any problems. I alread y have my work permit” – her permission from the government of this foreign coun try to work there – “and vaccinations.” “Vaccinations” are injections that y ou get from the doctor to protect you against some diseases that might be present in a foreign country that is not present in your own country.

Danielle says, “I speak the language fairly well,” meaning pretty well, very well but not perfectly. “And remember,” she says, “I don 't have any family to relocate.” “To relocate” means to move from one place to anoth er, to leave your home or apartment and move to a completely different, usual ly, town or state, or in this case, country. You may know that the prefix “re” me ans again. So, “relocate” means in a way to find yourself again in another pl ace, to move yourself to another place.

Angus says, “I didn't think I'd” – I would – “have any problems either, but when I got to McQuillanland” – the new country – “I was in  culture shock.” “Culture shock” is a feeling of confusion, of unhappiness, t hat often happens when you move to a new place, when you move to a new country . Usually, when you move to somewhere for the first time and you want to go there, you’re very happy during the first, maybe month, two months, maybe ev en six months that you're there. We sometimes call that situation, that condi tion, “euphoria.” (euphoria). After this period of euphoria, however, usually you  go through another part of your adjustment which is culture shock.

“Culture shock” is when you feel like you're confus ed or you're angry, or you don't really understand and like the new place that you'r e living. This happens to everyone that I've ever met who's lived in another country, including myself. At first, everything is great but then you go through a period where things are very difficult. You look around and you say, “I'm not li ke these people here.” This happens even when you move to a different part of y our country.

When I moved to Los Angeles, I went through culture  shock after the first year or so of living here. If you are able to survive that stage, that period of culture shock, things will get better, and you'll have a more real istic, balanced view of the place where you live after perhaps, a year or two, but so metimes culture shock can be so serious that it causes people to move back to wh ere they came from.

Angus says he went through culture shock when he mo ved to McQuillanland. Danielle says, “I'm ready for the differences in the cost of living.” The “cost of living” is how much it costs you to live in a certa in place, how much the food is, how much the rent is, and so forth. All of those are part of the cost of living. In some countries, the cost of living is much higher t han in other countries. In some cities like Los Angeles, the cost of living is much  higher than in other cities.

Danielle says that she'll be getting a housing allo wance. A “housing allowance” is money that a company gives you to pay for the rent of your house, or apartment when you are working in a different city or a diffe rent country. Danielle says the housing allowance will “offset” the increase in “li ving expenses.”

“To offset” (offset) means to have the opposite eff ect. In this case, even though the cost of living will be higher, the housing allo wance will pay for that. It will counteract, we might say, that. It will offset it. It will balance it. She says the housing allowance will offset the increase in livin g expenses. “Living expenses” is basically the same as cost of living – what it cost s you to rent your apartment, to drive your car, to buy your food and so forth. Angu s says, “I wasn't thinking so much about the expense” – the money required – “of living abroad. I was referring to a different pace of life.” “Pace” (pac e) is like speed. “Pace of life” would be how rushed people are, how relaxed people are. The pace of life in New York and Los Angeles is much faster than the pa ce of life in Honolulu, Hawaii, or in a small town in Minnesota. That's “pa ce of life.”

Angus says, “There are many cultural differences th at affect every facet of life.” “Facet” (facet) means part or feature. Danielle say s, “That's what I'm looking forward to. It'll all be so exciting.” It will all be very exciting.

Angus says, “I'm glad you're in euphoria right now”  – we explained euphoria a few minutes ago – “ but be prepared for some bumps in the road.” “Bumps in the road” is an expression meaning difficulties or chal lenges that you will have to face on your way to reaching your goal, on the way to your destination. There’ll be bumps in the road. Literally, “bumps” are where the earth of the road goes up a little higher and it causes your car to bounce a little bit as you go over the bump. “Bumps in the road,” however, is an expressio n meaning difficulties in obtaining or achieving your goal.

Danielle says, “No problem. To me, smooth sailing w ould be boring.” Danielle is not worried about difficulties or bumps in the road . She thinks that the opposite of that would be boring. The opposite expression for b umps in the road is, in a way, “smooth sailing.” “Smooth sailing” means you don't have any problems. You are able to reach your goal without having any difficul ties. “Sailing” is when you go

out in a boat and you let the power of the wind mov e the boat back and forth. “Smooth” is the opposite of rough or in this case, difficult. “Smooth sailing” is not having any difficulties.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Danielle:  I’m so excited!  I just got my new posti ng overseas.  I can’t wait to live abroad and work as an expat.

Angus:  I remember my first overseas assignment.  I t was interesting, but the adjustment took some time.

Danielle:  I won’t have any problems.  I already ha ve my work permit and vaccinations, and I speak the language fairly well.   And remember, I don’t have any family to relocate.

Angus:  I didn’t think I’d have any problems either , but when I got to McQuillanland, I was in culture shock.

Danielle:  I’m ready for the differences in the cos t of living.  I’ll be getting a housing allowance, which will offset the increase i n living expenses.

Angus:  I wasn’t thinking so much about the expense  of living abroad.  I was referring to a different pace of life and the many cultural differences that affect every facet of life.

Danielle:  That’s what I’m looking forward to.  It’ ll all be so exciting.

Angus:  I’m glad you’re in euphoria right now, but be prepared for some bumps in the road.

Danielle:  No problem.  To me, smooth sailing would  be boring!

# Getting a Marriage License

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 905: Getting a Marriage License.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 905. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website ESLPod.com has some additional courses in business and daily English that you might enjoy. Go to our website and  take a look.

This episode is a dialogue about someone who is going to get married and needs to get the official government marriage license. Le t's get started.

[start of dialog]

Yves:  Help me fill out this application for our ma rriage license.

Vanessa:  Can’t you do it?  I’m really busy with wo rk right now.  Do as much as you can and ask me if you don’t know something.

Yves:  Okay, I’ll try, but I’m reading through the requirements, and it’s a good idea for both of us to know what they are.

Vanessa:  Okay, then just read them out loud to me.

Yves:  All right.  We need to bring identification and it’s best to bring our birth certificates, just in case.  We don’t need blood te sts and there’s no waiting period in this state.  Are you listening?

Vanessa:  To every word.  Go on.

Yves:  For people who have been married before, the y’ll have to bring proof of divorce, death, or annulment.  Okay, since you’ve b een married before, you’ll need to bring a copy of your final divorce decree.  Did you hear that?

Vanessa:  Yeah, yeah.

Yves:  We can choose any qualified officiant and the marriage license is valid for 90 days – that’s 90 days to get married and have the marriage recorded.  We only have 90 days after we get the license to get m arried, got that?

 Vanessa:  Sure, 90 days.  No problem.

Yves:  I’m starting to wonder.  If you don’t have t ime to fill out our marriage license application, how will you make time for our  wedding?

Vanessa:  What?  I’m really busy right now.  Let’s talk about it later.

Yves:  Is it just me, or does this conversation not  bode well for our future marriage?

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Yves – which in English, s pelled “Eve” would be a woman's name, but this is the French “Yves” and so it’s a man – Yves says, “Help me fill out this application for our marriage  license.” Yves and Vanessa are going to get married and when you get married in the United States, you have to fill out or complete an application. An “applicatio n” is a form that you are required to complete with information about yourself. This is an application for a marriage license.

The state governments in the United States each con trol the giving of marriage licenses. A license is recognition by the governmen t that you are officially married, that you are married according to the law.  That's a marriage license. It’s sort of like a license to drive except you don't ha ve to take a test to be married. You probably should  have to take a test to be married but you don't. You have to do that only if you want to drive a car.

Vanessa says, “Can't you do it? I'm really busy wit h work right now. Do as much as you can and just ask me if you don't know someth ing.” Vanessa is very busy, she says, too busy to even help fill out the applic ation for her marriage license. Yves says, “Okay, I'll try, but I'm reading through  the requirements and it's a good idea for both of us to know what they are.” So Yves  says, “Yes, I understand you're busy, but I think you should do this with me .” Vanessa says, “Okay. Then just read them out loud to me.” “Out loud” means sp eaking the words so that other people can hear them. The opposite of out lou d would be “in silence” or “to yourself” – where you read something but you’re not  saying anything as you're reading.

Yves says, “Okay” – actually he says, “All right,” which means okay, “we need to bring identification and it's best to bring our bir th certificates just in case.” “Identification” is some document that proves that you are who you say you are.

Typically, identification would be a driver’s licen se or a passport, but for some things, like getting married, some states might req uire a birth certificate, which says you were born with this name, at this place, o n this date.

Yves says, “We don't need blood tests and there is no waiting period in this state.” “Blood tests” are analyses of your blood to  determine if you have any diseases or illnesses that can be detected that way . Many states used to require that the man and the woman getting married have a b lood test. I think there’s still maybe one state that still requires blood tests. the blood test is not to determine, as some people think, whether these two people are biologically compatible, whether they'll be a good match. That, of course, i sn't something you could figure out from a blood test. If you could, we could save a lot of problems but unfortunately, you can't determine the most importa nt things about the person you're getting married to by testing their blood.

Now, blood tests were used to make sure that one of  the people getting married didn't have diseases that might harm the other pers on – specifically, syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted disease, a disease that you get from someone who has the disease by having sexual relations with  that person. At one time, in the 1930’s and 1940’s, it was thought that syphilis  was a big problem and so we had to have blood tests to make sure that the disea se didn't spread, didn't infect more people, but it was decided that it wasn't as b ig a problem as people thought, and so most of these blood tests in almost  every state have been eliminated. Interestingly enough, however, the rate  of syphilis has almost doubled in the United States in the last 10 years.

Yves says that, “We don't need blood tests and ther e is no waiting period in this state.” In some states, you can't just get married on the day that you decide to get married. You can’t go down and decide, “I’m going to get married today.” Instead, you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can get your marriage license.

That's probably a good idea. If you woke up this mo rning and said, “Hmm, I'm going to get married today,” that's probably not a very good idea. You should probably think about it for at least a few days. As  in the case of blood tests, however, most states do not have a waiting period, or at least there are a lot of states that don't. California does not. So, you can  fly to California and get married that same day. Pretty exciting! I don't recommend it, but you can do it. States that do have waiting periods typically require that you wait only maybe three to five days – not very long.

Yves says, “Are you listening?” He thinks that Vane ssa is not listening to him. Vanessa, however, says “To every word.” I'm listeni ng to every word you say – go on, continue. Yves says, “For people who have be en married before, they'll have to bring proof of divorce.” “Proof” is some so rt of document or evidence or object that you have that demonstrates that what yo u are saying is true. If you have been married, and then have legally ended your  marriage, have divorced your partner, you have to prove that. You have to p rove it typically through something called a “divorce decree” or a “final div orce decree” (decree).

A “final divorce decree” is just a piece of paper f rom the place where you were divorced, saying, “Yes, in fact, these two people a re no longer married.” It's also possible, although it's not very common, that you can end a marriage not with divorce but with “annulment.” “Annulment” (annulmen t) is when you have a situation where something happens that makes the ma rriage invalid, that the conditions for marriage are not met.

One of the conditions for a couple to be legally ma rried in most places or at least in many places is that they have sexual relations. If they don't, the marriage can be annulled. Marriage is not legally, technically, a marriage until the couple has sexual relations. Annulments however, are quite rar e.

Divorces however, are not rare, and in our story, it looks like Vanessa has been married before and divorced. So, she will need to bring proof of that. Interesting statistic: more second marriages fail than first ma rriages, and more third marriages fail than second marriages. You would thi nk that people would have experience with marriage the first time, and so the  second time would be successful, but it's in fact just the opposite. So,  if you've gotten a divorce once, you're much more likely to get a divorce again.

Vanessa doesn't seem to be listening to Yves. Yves says, “Did you hear that? And Vanessa says, “Yeah, yeah.” You can tell she's not interested. Yves goes on, “You can choose any qualified officiant.” An “o fficiant” (officiant) is usually a religious official – a priest, a minister, a rabbi,  an imam – who is recognized as a religious official and can therefore marry you, can  say that you are married. You don't have to go to a religious official, however. You can get married by someone from the government, by a judge, for example.

Yves says that, “The marriage license is valid for 90 days.” So, you get your marriage license and then you must use that marriag e license, you must actually get married, within 90 days. You have to get marrie d and then go back and return the license to the government to say, “Yes, we got married on this date, by this

person.” That's having your marriage recorded. “To be recorded” here means to be registered officially with the government.

Again, Yves asked Vanessa if she's listening if she  understands, and Vanessa says, “Sure, no problem.” Yves says, “I'm starting to wonder” – I'm starting to have doubts. “If you don't have time to fill out ou r marriage license application, how will you make time for our wedding?” “To make t ime for something” is to schedule something, to take some action to make sur e that you have time for something. Your “wedding” of course, is the ceremon y in which you get married. It's those few minutes or perhaps hour, during whic h you have the marriage ceremony.

Vanessa says, “What? I'm really busy right now. Let 's talk about it later.” Yves says, “Is it just me, or does this conversation not  bode well for our future marriage?” The expression “Is it just me or” is use d when we are sort of making a joke, trying to say that “It seems obvious to me bu t other people do not seem to have noticed or don't seem to think it is obvious.”  “Is it just me” means “Am I the only one who thinks this?” What does Yves think? He  thinks that this conversation that he has just had with Vanessa does  not “bode (bode) well” for his marriage. “To bode well” is to be a good sign. “To not  bode well” is to be a bad sign, an indication that something bad is going  to happen in the future.

Now let’s listen to our dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Yves:  Help me fill out this application for our ma rriage license.

Vanessa:  Can’t you do it?  I’m really busy with wo rk right now.  Do as much as you can and ask me if you don’t know something.

Yves:  Okay, I’ll try, but I’m reading through the requirements, and it’s a good idea for both of us to know what they are.

Vanessa:  Okay, then just read them out loud to me.

Yves:  All right.  We need to bring identification and it’s best to bring our birth certificates, just in case.  We don’t need blood te sts and there’s no waiting period in this state.  Are you listening?

Vanessa:  To every word.  Go on.

 Yves:  For people who have been married before, the y’ll have to bring proof of divorce, death, or annulment.  Okay, since you’ve b een married before, you’ll need to bring a copy of your final divorce decree.  Did you hear that?

Vanessa:  Yeah, yeah.

Yves:  We can choose any qualified officiant and the marriage license is valid for 90 days – that’s 90 days to get married and have the marriage recorded.  We only have 90 days after we get the license to get m arried, got that?

Vanessa:  Sure, 90 days.  No problem.

Yves:  I’m starting to wonder.  If you don’t have t ime to fill out our marriage license application, how will you make time for our  wedding?

Vanessa:  What?  I’m really busy right now.  Let’s talk about it later.

Yves:  Is it just me, or does this conversation not  bode well for our future marriage?

# Using Illegal Drugs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 906 – Using Illegal Drugs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  906. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast by going to our website.

This episode is a dialog between Ron and Nancy abou t using drugs that are illegal. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Nancy:  So, what do you think?

Ron:  Uh, that was interesting.

Nancy:  That’s all you have to say?  I spent six mo nths making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter illega l drug use.

Ron:  Well, I’m not sure if it gets the point acros s.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  I show footage of people  using hardcore drugs.

Ron:  That’s just it.  You start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it’s a gateway drug, and then showing addicts popping pills, shooting up heroine, and snorting and freebasing cocaine.

Nancy:  I’m trying to show the downhill spiral that  results from illegal drug use.

Ron:  But considering how incredibly explicit the f ilm is, I’m afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of film.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  What type of film?

Ron:  Well, instead of an anti-drug educational fil m, it seems more instructional. If kids didn’t know how to use illegal drugs before , they will after watching this film!

 [end of dialog]

Nancy begins our dialogue by saying to Ron, “So wha t do you think?” What is your opinion (of something)? Ron says, “Uh, that wa s interesting.” Notice: the way that he says that indicates that he perhaps doe sn't like it or disagrees with it. This is a common, polite way that people sometimes indicate to others that they have an opinion that perhaps disagrees with the per son they're talking to, and that the person they're talking to won't like. Some one may ask, “What you think of my new shirt?” And you think it's really ugly. You might say, “Oh, that's interesting.” Of course, if you say it that way the n they know exactly what you're really saying.

Nancy says, “That's all you have to say? I spent si x months making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter i llegal drug use.” So Nancy has made a movie, a film, that is an “anti-drug” film. “Anti (anti) –“ usually means against. You can be antidiscrimination. You are aga inst discrimination. You don't like it. “Anti-drug” would be someone who is agains t drugs, who opposes drugs – in this case, drugs that people use for what we mig ht call “recreational purposes,” just for fun.

Nancy made this anti-drug film “to show students in  schools to try and deter illegal drug use.” “To deter” (deter) means to disc ourage someone from doing something. “To deter” means to try to get someone not  to do something. So, if you have a law against guns, you're trying to deter  violence. You're trying to prevent violence. Here, we’re trying to prevent peo ple from using drugs illegally. “Illegal” (illegal) means “not legal” – in this cas e, drugs that people are not supposed to use without permission.

Ron says, “Well, I'm not sure if it gets the point across.” “To get the point across” means to make yourself clear, to make your message clear, to very clearly communicate what you're trying to say to the other person. Nancy says, “What do you mean? I show footage of people using hardcore d rugs.” “Footage” (footage) refers to video or film, but usually just one part of a movie, or one part of a show, or one part of a video. The word is used generally to talk about a video or a film of something, often that is part of a larger film o r larger video. “Footage” might also refer to just a short piece of video.

Nancy says, “I show footage of people using hardcor e drugs.” The word “hardcore” (hardcore) – one word – means extreme, the most serious type of something, usually something that's negative. At le ast that was the traditional use of this word “hardcore.” If you talk about “hardcor e drugs,” you are saying that

these were very bad drugs, drugs that would cause p erhaps an extreme reaction in the person, drugs like cocaine or heroin.

In the last 20 years or so, people, especially youn ger people, have started to use the word to describe a very intense or extreme expe rience, or someone who is really committed to or devoted to a certain kind of  activity. Someone who goes swimming every day for three hours might be describ ed as a “hardcore swimmer” – someone who's really dedicated, who’s extreme in their dedication. But here, it means drugs that are potentially very dangerous.

Ron says, “That's just it.” That's the problem. “Yo u start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it's a gateway d rug.” “Pot” (pot) is an informal word for marijuana, the illegal drug that comes fro m the cannabis plant. “To smoke pot” would be to smoke a marijuana cigarette.  There are lots of names for marijuana cigarettes. The most common, at least whe n I was growing up, was “joint” (joint). People talked about “smoking joint s.” (Well, not me …other people!)

Ron says that in the movie, Nancy shows people smok ing pot – “making the point” – trying to communicate the idea – “that it' s a gateway drug.” The term “gateway (gateway) drug” refers to a drug that is n ot very harmful, that doesn't have very serious effects, but that might lead peop le to want more and more drugs – drugs that are more serious that do  have more serious effects. Marijuana is not considered a hardcore drug. It doesn't have serious effects on people when they take it. It's not seriously addicting – at lea st, as much as marijuana and cocaine, I don't think. I don't know. I have not tr ied any of these drugs, but many people believe that if you allow people to smoke ma rijuana legally, that will lead them to more serious drugs.

“Gateway” is a word that comes from “gate” (gate) w hich is the…doors to an open space, usually a garden or the front of your h ouse, not the door of your house but – the property of your house might have a  fence around it and in order to go through the fence, you go through a “gate.” I t's an entrance. So, “gateway” refers to the place where you would enter into some thing. In this case, you would enter into the world of more serious drugs.

So, Nancy begins her film by showing people smoking  marijuana, and then showing “addicts popping pills, shooting up heroin,  and snorting and freebasing cocaine.” There are several drug-related terms in t hat sentence, that clause. Let's go through them briefly.

The first word is “addict” (addict). An “addict” is  a person who is reliant on or addicted to some sort of drug, some sort of chemica l substance. Usually, we use

this word in talking about someone who has a seriou s drug addiction, a serious drug problem with hardcore drugs such as cocaine an d heroin.

“To pop (pop) pills” means to swallow a lot of pill s. It's often an expression we use to indicate someone who abuses drugs, especiall y drugs that you may get from your doctor for legitimate reasons, for good r easons, but then you take too many of them. You start taking them just to feel go od. That's to “pop pills.”

“To to shoot up heroin” means to inject an illegal drug called heroin into your skin, into your blood vessels, in order to feel the  effects of the drug. People who are “shooting up” are people who are using drugs th at require that you stick a needle, a sharp point, into your skin in order to p ut the drugs right into your body.

Finally, we talk about “snorting and freebasing coc aine.” “Cocaine” is another hardcore drug, illegal drug. “To snort” (snort) mea ns to breathe in with your nose. This verb can be used to describe someone who may make a funny sound when they laugh like [laughs and snorts] – like that. Bu t in talking about drugs, “to snort” is to breathe in, in order to get the drug i nto your body through your nose. “To freebase” (freebase) means to heat cocaine in o rder to prepare it to be smoked. You are converting the cocaine in order to smoke it instead of snorting it.

Nancy says, “I'm trying to show” – with her film – “the downhill spiral that results from illegal drug use.” “Downhill spiral” (spiral) is a situation that is becoming worse and worse. “To go downhill” means to go from the top of a hill to the bottom of the hill. We talk about “downhill skiing, ” for example. A “spiral” is when something goes around in a circle, usually moving i n addition to moving around and around. So, a “downhill spiral” would be a situ ation that is going to down in the sense of getting worse.

Ron says, “But considering how incredibly explicit the film is, I'm afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of fi lm.” “To be explicit” (explicit) means to show something directly, with a lot of det ail. This word is like hardcore, sometimes associated, for example, with pornography , for the showing of sexual acts. If we talk about a movie being very explicit,  or having “explicit sexual content,” that's what we’re talking about. It could  also have explicit violence. Usually, “explicit” has a somewhat negative connota tion, a negative meaning.

Nancy says, “What do you mean?” What type of film? Ron is saying that teachers might think this is a different kind of film. Ron s ays, “Well, instead of being an anti-drug educational film, it seems more instructi onal.” “Instructional” means something that is designed to teach people how to d o something.

 Ron says, “If kids didn’t know how to use illegal d rugs before,” meaning before watching the film, “they will after watching this f ilm.” Ron is saying that the film is so explicit. It shows in detail so much about how to use drugs, that it might actually have the opposite effect. It might show ch ildren how drugs are used rather than warning them against using those drugs.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Nancy:  So, what do you think?

Ron:  Uh, that was interesting.

Nancy:  That’s all you have to say?  I spent six mo nths making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter illega l drug use.

Ron:  Well, I’m not sure if it gets the point acros s.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  I show footage of people  using hardcore drugs.

Ron:  That’s just it.  You start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it’s a gateway drug, and then showing addicts popping pills, shooting up heroine, and snorting and freebasing cocaine.

Nancy:  I’m trying to show the downhill spiral that  results from illegal drug use.

Ron:  But considering how incredibly explicit the f ilm is, I’m afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of film.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  What type of film?

Ron:  Well, instead of an anti-drug educational fil m, it seems more instructional. If kids don’t know how to use illegal drugs before,  they will after watching this film!

[end of dialog]

Our scriptwriter knows how to get the point across in her very instructional dialogs, and she does it all without smoking pot.



# Buying Tools at a Hardware Store

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 907 – Buying Tools at a Hardware Store.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 907. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in the city of, the beautiful city of, Los Angeles, Ca lifornia.

Our website is of course, ESLPod.com. Become a memb er of ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide to this episode.

This episode is a dialog about buying tools, things  you use in order to fix other things or make other things, at a hardware store, a  place where you buy tools. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Chuck:  Just remember that we have a lot to accompl ish today, so let’s just get what we need and go, okay?

Ayaka:  Sure, we just need a few tools for our DIY project.  The power tools are over there.

Chuck:  Whoa, we’re not getting power tools.  We ju st need a few simple hand tools:  a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers –  and maybe an extra screwdriver or two.

Ayaka:  We would get the job done so much more quic kly if we had power tools. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun.  We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table saw.

Chuck:  A table saw?!  We’re doing some simple repa irs, not remodeling our house.

Ayaka:  You never know when you need a good saw and  I’ve always wanted a table saw.

Chuck:  Other women want clothes and jewelry, and y ou want power tools?

Ayaka:  That’s right.  You should be counting your lucky stars!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Chuck saying to Ayaka, “Just  remember that we have a lot to accomplish today, so let's just get what we need and go, okay?” Chuck is telling Ayaka that they have a lot to “accomplish” today, meaning they have a lot of things they need to do today, to get done today.  He just wants to go into the store, get what they need, and leave.

Ayaka says, “Sure. We just” – or only – “need a few  tools for our DIY project.” “DIY” is an abbreviation for the phrase, “Do It You rself.” “To do it yourself” means to build something or construct something on your o wn. If you want to table, you could buy a table or you could do a “DIY project.” a do-it-yourself project where you build the table.

Ayaka says, “The power tools are over there.” “Powe r tools” are tools that are electric, that you plug into a wall. For example, y ou could have a power drill. That’s a kind of tool that is used to make holes in  something. “Power tools” are any tools that run on electricity. Chuck says, “Who a, we’re not getting any power tools.” That first word “whoa” is used to express s urprise. Chuck is surprised that Ayaka wants to buy some power tools.

He says, “We just need a few simple hand tools.” A “hand tool” is something that is not electric. It's a tool that you just use your  own physical force, with your own bodily force, or power. A hammer, for example, is a  hand tool. It’s used to hit things that you need to put into, say, a piece of w ood, like a nail.

Chuck says, “We just need a few simple hand tools: a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers – and maybe an extra screwdrive r or two. “Hammer,” we just mentioned, is a tool usually that has a wooden hand le that is you grab it by, a long piece of wood, and at the end of the wood, the re is a heavy metal part that is used to hit (usually) nails. “Nails” are small p ieces of metal that you use to attach something or to put something into a piece of wood. That's a hammer.

A “wrench” (wrench) is a tool made of metal. The ha ndle, the part that you grab onto with your hand, is long and narrow. On the top  of the tool, there is what looks like the letter “U” turned on its side, and y ou are able to make the “U” smaller or larger in order to fit over, say, a pipe  – a long round metal tube – that you want to turn. That's a wrench.

A “chisel” (chisel) is a tool that has a wooden han dle and a long flat piece of metal at the other end that is sharp. It's a way of  cutting into wood, for example. There are other uses for a chisel. When we think ab out the great sculptors like

Michelangelo, we think of someone with a hammer and  a chisel, using the chisel to remove pieces of rock from the marble so that he  can make the statue. That's another use of a chisel.

“Pliers” (pliers) is a tool that looks a little lik e a pair of scissors. It's made of (usually) metal, and is used to grab things – not to cut things, typically, but to grab them and turn them, or pull them.

A “screwdriver” (screwdriver) is a tool, again usua lly made of metal, that looks like a long stick, and at one end of the stick is a  narrow piece of metal that is part of the stick. that's used to turn something called the “screw.” A “screw” is a small piece of metal that goes into a piece of wood or ot her material by turning  it. A “nail” is a small piece of metal that goes into woo d or other material by hitting  it. So, that's what a screwdriver does. It screws or pu ts than screw into a piece of wood or metal or other material.

Ayaka says, “We would get the job done so much more  quickly if we had power tools.” Ayaka is saying, “Yes, we can buy hand tool s, but power tools would be quicker. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun.” The other way of putting a nail into a piece of wood or other material is to  buy an electric tool, a power tool, called a “nail gun.” It's not a real gun. A “ nail gun” is a power tool that pushes nails into wood in a way that doesn't requir e you to pound or hit anything. It's all done by the machine. A “power drill” (dril l) is a tool used to create a narrow, deep hole in a piece of wood or metal or ot her material.

So, Ayaka says that instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun. “We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table s aw.” Ayaka is walking around the hardware store, and she's seeing things that sh e wants to get. That's why we have this somewhat unusual expression in the middle  of the sentence, “and hey.” Here it indicates that she has just seen something and she's stopping herself in order to describe what she sees. In this case, it's  something she wants. It's a “sander.”

A “sander” (sander) is a machine that is used to ma ke wooden surfaces, a piece of wood, smooth by rubbing or moving back and forth  something called “sandpaper.” “Sandpaper” is a piece of paper that h as small, hard objects on it, and if you rub it back and forth over a piece of wo od, the wood will become smooth. That's what a “sander” does. A “sander” is an electric power tool.

A “table saw” is a large machine that is used to cu t long pieces of wood. A “saw” (saw) could also be a hand tool. You can have a han dsaw that you move back and forth. It's like a big knife that you’re moving  back and forth to cut something,

such as a piece of wood. A “table saw” is a saw tha t runs on electricity that you would have in your garage or wherever you’re workin g that is used to cut long pieces of wood – or short pieces of wood, I guess.

Chuck says, A “table saw? We’re doing some simple r epairs, not remodeling our house.” Chuck doesn't like Ayaka’s idea of buying a ll of these power tools. He says, “We’re doing some simple, some easy repairs.”  “Repairs” (repairs) are corrections or modifications to fix something, to g et something working again. If you have a refrigerator, and it stops working, you need to get it repaired. You need to fix whatever the problem is – or you can ju st buy a new refrigerator. Chuck says that they're not “remodeling” their hous e. “To remodel” (remodel) means to make major or large changes in your house.  If you are remodeling your kitchen, you might be removing all of the things in  your kitchen and basically building a new kitchen or changing things significa ntly. That's “to remodel.”

Ayaka says, “You never know when you need a good sa w, and I've always wanted a table saw.” “You never know” means you can 't possibly anticipate when you will, in this case, need a good saw. Chuck says , “Other women want clothes and jewelry, and you want power tools?” Chuck is su rprised that Ayaka wants to buy these tools, which we might associate more trad itionally with men. Ayaka says “That's right.” That's correct. “You should be  counting your lucky stars.” “To count (count) your lucky stars” means to be very gr ateful for something that has happened, something that you don't have any control  over. What Ayaka is saying here, somewhat jokingly, is that Chuck is a very lu cky husband because his wife doesn't want to go out and spend money and buy clot hes and jewelry, like perhaps some other wives do. No, his wife just want s to buy power tools.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Chuck:  Just remember that we have a lot to accompl ish today, so let’s just get what we need and go, okay?

Ayaka:  Sure, we just need a few tools for our DIY project.  The power tools are over there.

Chuck:  Whoa, we’re not getting power tools.  We ju st need a few simple hand tools:  a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers –  and maybe an extra screwdriver or two.

Ayaka:  We would get the job done so much more quic kly if we had power tools. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun.  We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table saw.

Chuck:  A table saw?!  We’re doing some simple repa irs, not remodeling our house.

Ayaka:  You never know when you need a good saw and  I’ve always wanted a table saw.

Chuck:  Other women want clothes and jewelry, and y ou want power tools?

Ayaka:  That’s right.  You should be counting your lucky stars!

This episode is a dialogue between Andy and Sita ab out responsibilities in the workplace. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Andy:  What are you doing?

Sita:  I’m running some numbers for the new project .

Andy:  I thought that was Delia’s turf.

Sita:  She’s usually the go-to person for this type  of information, but I need this info right now.

Andy:  I’d be careful about stepping on Delia’s toe s.  She doesn’t take kindly to people encroaching on her responsibilities.

Sita:  I know she can be territorial at times, but I’m sure if I explain to her why I’m getting this information right this minute, she’d u nderstand.

Andy:  Okay, but don’t be surprised if she thinks y ou’re trying to gain control of her little fiefdom.  She’s really entrenched and sh e doesn’t like anyone muscling in.

Sita:  Do you really think she’ll misunderstand my motives?

Andy:  I wouldn’t take any chances.  Hurry up and f inish what you’re doing, cover your tracks, and get out.  With any luck, she won’t  think this is the beginning of a turf war.

[end of dialog]

Andy begins by asking Sita, “What are you doing?” S ita says, “I'm running some numbers on the new project.” “To run some numbers,”  or “to run the  numbers,” means to do some sort of mathematical calculation, to analyze data, to analyze information in the form of numbers. Sometimes we’ll  say, “I'm going to run the numbers.” We might also say, “I'm going to crunch ( crunch) the numbers.” Both of these are terms used in the business world to de scribe the activity of analyzing information using some sort of calculation, some so rt of statistical analysis.

Andy says, “I thought that was Delia’s turf.” “Turf ” (turf) means the area that you believe you have control over. It can also mean ter ritory. The word “territory” (territory) is usually used in talking about countr ies – what territory belongs to this country, what area of land belongs to this country.  However, it could also be used in a “smaller sense,” we could say, talking about r esponsibilities at work. Well, this is my territory. This is my turf. This is the area that I feel responsible for, that I am responsible for. The word “turf” usually is us ed to imply that someone feels strongly about the area that they have responsibili ty for, and doesn't want anyone else interfering.

Sita says “She” – meaning Delia – “is usually the g o to person for this type of information, but I need this info right now.” The e xpression “go-to person” means the person who you would normally ask to do a certa in task because that person is an expert, that person is the best person to do that. Sita says that Delia is normally the person who would crunch or “run the nu mbers,” but she needs this “info” – this information – “right now.” Sita can't  wait for Delia to do the analysis, so she is doing it herself.

Andy says, “I'd be careful about stepping on Delia' s toes.” “To step on someone's toes” (toes) means to interfere with their area of responsibility, to become involved in someone else's work when that other per son doesn't want you to be involved. So, for example, if I am supposed to orga nize a meeting, and you decide that you're going to help me organize the me eting even though I don't want you to, that would be a case of you “stepping on my toes.” Your “toes” are the digits that are on your feet. You have fingers on your hands. On your feet, you have toes. The phrasal verb “to step on” means to put your foot on top of. “To step on someone's toes,” then, is a metaphor, m eaning to get in someone's way, to interfere with someone else's responsibilit ies.

Andy says, “Delia doesn't take kindly to people enc roaching on her responsibilities.” The expression “does not take ki ndly to” means dislikes, resents, does not like something, is very uncomfort able with something. You

don't hear this expression too frequently, but you will still read it and hear it, about someone “not taking kindly to” some action th at another person does. In this case, Delia does not take kindly to people “en croaching on her responsibilities.” “To encroach” (encroach) means to become involved in something that belongs to someone else, to become i nvolved in some activity that another person is responsible for. It's very s imilar to the phrase “to step on someone's toes.” “To encroach” means to start to mo ve in someone else turf, especially when we're talking about a work environm ent. Delia does not take kindly to other people encroaching on her responsib ilities, taking over for responsibilities.

Sita says, “I know she can be territorial at times. ” Sita says that Delia can be “territorial” (territorial). “To be territorial” is  related to the noun “territory.” The idea that this is my area of responsibility, this is my turf, and I don't want anyone else interfering with me. Sita says, “I'm sure if I expl ained to her” – to Delia – “why I'm getting this information right this minute, she'd u nderstand.” “Right this minute” means right now, immediately, right away. “I need t his information right this minute.” I need this information now .

Andy says, “Okay, but don't be surprised if she thi nks you're trying to gain control of her little fiefdom.” “To gain control” means to have power over someone or something, usually power that you get by taking it from another person. So, you have someone at your work who is responsible for the annual meeting with your entire company. You try to gain control of that job , of that task, of that responsibility, by taking over the power from that person.

The word “fiefdom” (fiefdom) refers to an area of l and belonging to someone with a lot of power. It's an old word that describes a s ystem, common in the Middle Ages in Europe, called “feudalism” (feudalism). Feu dalism involved receiving land and protection from a very wealthy person in e xchange for working for that person or giving some sort of service to that perso n. Here, and in modern usage, “fiefdom” refers to an area that you are responsibl e for and that you are very territorial about, an area of responsibility that y ou don't want anyone else interfering with.

Andy says, “Delia is really entrenched and she does n't like anyone muscling in.” “To be entrenched” (entrenched) means you are unlik ely to change. You have your established ways, the ways you do things, and you're not going to change for anyone. That's me. I'm very entrenched in some of my ideas! Well, Andy says, Delia is entrenched, “and she doesn't like an yone muscling in.” “To muscle (muscle) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to go into someone else's space, someone else's area of responsibility, in th is case. It can literally mean to

use physical force to get into someone's territory or someone's area, but here it means something like gaining control of someone els e's responsibility, by using some sort of pressure, using some tactic that allow s you to gain control even if the other person doesn't want you to.

Sita says, “Do you really think she'll misunderstan d” – or not understand – “my motives?” Your “motive” is your motivation, your re ason for doing something. Andy says, “I wouldn't take any chances,” meaning y ou shouldn't try to do this unless you're absolutely sure. You shouldn't risk a nything. He says, “Hurry up and finish what you're doing, cover your tracks, an d get out.” “To cover your tracks” (tracks) means to remove evidence so that o ther people don't know where you've been or what you have done. We use this expression when someone is doing something wrong and you don't want  anyone else to know about it, so you're going to hide the evidence or g et rid of any indication that you were there or that you did something wrong.

Andy says, “With any luck” – if you're lucky – “she  won't think this is the beginning of a turf war.” A “turf war” is when two different people or two different groups are fighting each other for responsibility of a certain task, usually in a large organization such as a company.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Andy:  What are you doing?

Sita:  I’m running some numbers for the new project .

Andy:  I thought that was Delia’s turf.

Sita:  She’s usually the go-to person for this type  of information, but I need this info right now.

Andy:  I’d be careful about stepping on Delia’s toe s.  She doesn’t take kindly to people encroaching on her responsibilities.

Sita:  I know she can be territorial at times, but I’m sure if I explain to her why I’m getting this information right this minute, she’d u nderstand.

Sita:  Do you really think she’ll misunderstand my motives?

Andy:  I wouldn’t take any chances.  Hurry up and f inish what you’re doing, cover your tracks, and get out.  With any luck, she won’t  think this is the beginning of a turf war.

# Buying Electronic Books

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 909 – Buying Electronic Books.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 909. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialogue between Kindo and Nookie  about buying electronic books. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Kindo: What’s that?

Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloa ding some new books onto it.

Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.

Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you  know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 di gital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library  from place to place.

Kindo: I don’t usually read 10,000 books all at onc e and I hear that there are a lot of incompatible formats out there. Each company is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the  format. I think I’ll just wait until the dust sett les.

Nookie: The different formats aren’t that big a dea l. You can easily convert a book in one format to another.

Kindo: I like the look of text on a printed page.

Nookie: You mean that faded text on that yellowed p age? On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line s pacing.

Kindo: Can I get all of the out-of-print books on m y shelves in digital format?

Nookie: Well, I’m not sure.

Kindo: Until I can, I’ll stick to my low-tech books .

[end of dialog]

We begin the dialog with “Kindo” (his real name!) a sking “Nookie,” which perhaps is a nickname, “What's that?” Nookie says, “It's my  new e-book reader.” An e- book reader is a small electronic device, usually t hat you can hold in your hands, that has electronic books. Examples would be the Ki ndle, the Nook, the iPad, using the iBook software – all of these would be cu rrent examples of e-book readers, although the iPad is more than an e-book r eader. That's what Nookie has.

Hey, maybe Nookie is related to “Nook” and “Kindo” is related to Kindle. Ahh…see, our Dr. Tse is very clever!

Anyway, Nookie says, “I'm just downloading some new  books on to it.” “To download” means to transfer information from the In ternet to your computer, or your phone, or whatever it is that you have. Nookie  is downloading some books onto the new device. Kindo says, “I haven't bought one yet. I'm old school. I still prefer a printed book.” The expression “old school”  means old-fashioned, preferring things from a long time ago. This is als o a very common expression nowadays, when people are talking about the way the y may do things. They may do them the way they used to be done many years ago , or it could be used to describe, as I think was one of the original uses, music. “I like old-school music from the 70’s and the 80’s.”

In our dialog, Kindo is “old school.” He says he pr efers a “printed book.” A “printed book” would be a book on physical paper. T he idea is that he likes doing things the way we used to do them. Nookie says, “Bu t if you haven't tried it yet, how do you know you won't like it better? This e-bo ok reader can store over 10,000 digital books.” “To store” (store) here, as a verb, means to keep something so that you can use it in the future. For  electronics, for computers, “to store” means to have something on your permanent me mory in your computer.

“Digital” (digital) refers to electronic informatio n – things that are stored on the hard drive of a computer, for example, things that are stored typically in what is called “binary (binary) code” – with zeros and ones . Nookie says that her e-book reader can store over 10,000 digital books and it's  “easily portable.” “To be portable” (portable) means that you can move it fro m one place to another. You can pick it up and move it to another place without  any difficulty. Nookie says, “Imagine” – or try to imagine, try to think about –  “trying to carry an entire library from place to place.” Nookie is saying that the e-b ook reader that she has is like

having an entire library in your pocket, an entire library that you can carry from one place to another.

Kindo says, “I don't usually read 10,000 books all at once,” meaning I don't read 10,000 books at the same time. So, Kindo is suggest ing here, perhaps, that's not such a big advantage. He also says that there are a  lot of “incompatible formats” out there. “To be incompatible” (incompatible) mean s that you are not able to get along with, or you are not able to use one thing wi th another. When we talk about physical things, “incompatible” means that you can' t use this thing with that thing. “Format” just refers to the way that a certain piec e of information, in this case, an electronic book, is created and stored. It's the fo rm that that particular piece of information takes. So, for example, if you have a K indle e-reader, you use something called .MOBI, or least that's one of the formats that can be used. Microsoft Word is another format. PDF is a format. These are ways of transmitting information.

If you have “incompatible formats,” you have a file , an electronic piece of information, that can't be used with certain things . They're incompatible. They can't be used together. So, Kindo says that “Each c ompany is trying to edge out the others by establishing their format as the  format.” “To edge (edge) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to try to push someon e else out of a competition or to eliminate someone from a certain competition.  In this case, it's the competition for consumers. “One company edges out a nother” is another way of saying one company is more successful than the othe r. One company is able to be the number one company in that particular area. In this case, we're talking about e-book readers.

Kindo says that “Each company is trying to edge out  the others” – the other companies – “by establishing” – or by creating and trying to get other people to follow – “their format as the  format,” meaning the only one that people should use. Kindo says, “I think I'll just wait until the dust settles.” “To wait until the dust settles” means that you have a situation where thin gs are changing very quickly and they're going to continue to change, so that it  doesn't make any sense for you to try to make a decision now. Just wait until things calm down. Wait until all of the changes are completed and then you can decid e what to do. That's what Kindo is recommending. He’s going to wait until the  “dust settles,” wait until we know which format of e-books will be the winner in this competition.

Nookie says, “The different formats aren't that big  a deal.” They’re not that important. “You can easily convert a book in one fo rmat to another,” or another format. “To convert” means to change something so t hat you transform it in some way so as to allow you to use it, in this case, on a different e-reader.

 But Kindo says, “I like the look of text” – or prin ted words – “on a printed page,” on paper page. Nookie says, “You mean that faded te xt on that yellowed page?” When text, when printed words on a piece of paper, become “faded,” they’re more difficult to see. They’re more difficult to re ad. Over time, of course, if you have something in the sun or out in the rain and th en later you try to read it, it might be more difficult because the text has faded.  It is no longer the same easy to see color that it used to be.

“Yellowed” simply means changing in color from, in this case, white paper to slightly yellow paper. You know how you have an old  book and you open it up and it might be 50 years old? Sometimes you'll see that the paper has become a different color, like a yellow color. That's where this word “yellowed” comes from, as an adjective – a page that is yellow.

Nookie says, “On an e-book reader, you can adjust the text size, font, and even line spacing.” Nookie is giving the advantages of a n e-book reader. She's saying you can adjust the “text size” – that's how big the  letters are - “the font” – that's the form of the letter. There are different fonts y ou can use – and “line spacing.” “Line spacing” is the amount of space between one l ine of text and another line of text.

Kindo says, “Can I get all of the out-of-print book s on my shelves in digital format?” Books that are “out-of-print” are books th at are no longer being made, books that you can no longer buy new. “Out-of-print  books” are books the companies have stopped printing, have stopped makin g.

Kindo asked Nookie a good question, whether the boo ks that he owns that are out-of-print are available for an e-reader, are ava ilable in electronic format, or as he says, a “digital format.” Nookie says, “Well, I' m not sure.” Kindo says, “Until I can” – meaning until I am able to read all of my ol d books on an e-book reader” – I'll stick to” – or I will stay with – “my low-tech  books.” “Low (low) – tech (tech)” is a term referring to “low technology” – technology t hat is very old, that is very simple, that has, perhaps been around for a long ti me. If you think of books, paper books, as a type of technology, then we’re ta lking about “low-tech,” something that doesn't require electronics or compu ters or anything like that. The opposite of low-tech would be “hi-tech.” “Hi-tech” would be the most sophisticated, advanced computers and other electro nic equipment that are now available.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Kindo: What’s that?

Nookie: It’s my new e-book reader. I’m just downloa ding some new books onto it.

Kindo: I haven’t bought one yet. I’m old school. I still prefer a printed book.

Nookie: But if you haven’t tried it yet, how do you  know you wouldn’t like it better? This e-book reader can store over 10,000 di gital books and it’s easily portable. Imagine trying to carry an entire library  from place to place.

# Plagiarizing a Paper

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 910 – Plagiarizing a Paper.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 910. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there to download a L earning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Samanth a about someone who is cheating in school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Paul:  All done.

Samantha:  You’re done with your paper?  How can th at be?  I’m just getting started.

Paul:  I’m just a better student than you are.

Samantha:  Let me see that.  You didn’t write this.

Paul:  No, I didn’t.  I downloaded somebody’s paper  from some website and slapped my name on it.  The professor will never kn ow.  Wise up.  Do you want me to find one for you?

Samantha:  No way!  Not only is it cheating, if you  get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.

Paul:  Don’t be such a goody two-shoes.  Everybody does it.  I know a guy who pays somebody in another state to write all of his papers for him and another guy who lifts his papers from old books.  Don’t tell me  you’ve never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your ow n.

Samantha:  Are you kidding me?  Borrowing ideas fro m a book with proper attribution is what you’re supposed to do.  You, on  the other hand, are plagiarizing your way to your degree.

Paul:  Damn straight!  Look who’s done with his hom ework and who is still working on hers.

Samantha:  I’d rather earn what I get and know that  I didn’t shortchange myself out of an education!

[end of dialog]

Paul begins our dialog by saying, “All done,” meani ng “all finished.” I'm completely finished with whatever I was doing. Sama ntha says, “You’re done with your paper?” “Paper” here, when we are talking  about school, refers to an essay or another written document that is required as part of your homework. It could be a report on a book. It could be an analysis of some subject – any of those things would be called a “paper.”

Samantha says, “How can that be?” “How is that poss ible?” she means. “I'm just getting started,” meaning I'm just getting started on my paper. Paul says, “I'm just a better student then you are.” Samantha says in re ply, “Let me see that. You didn't write this.” Samantha is saying that Paul di dn't even write this paper that he said he completed.

Paul says, “No, I didn't. I downloaded somebody’s p aper from some website and slapped my name on it.” Paul says that he bought, h e purchased, or at least, he downloaded from the Internet, this paper and then “ slapped” his name on it. “To slap (slap) on something” means to add something, u sually something to a written document.

Let's say you're preparing a report for your boss a nd, you, at the very last minute, right before you need to give it to him, you rememb er that you didn't put a conclusion on it. You didn't summarize your finding s. So, you decide to “slap on” a conclusion. It means to add something to a docume nt very quickly, but not very carefully, often done without a lot of preparation.

It's not a good idea to slap something on a documen t right before you need to turn it in. That's, however, what Paul is saying ab out his name. He slapped his name on this document. He just changed the name and  put his own name on it.

He says, “The professor” – the teacher, the instruc tor – “will never know. Wise up. Do you want me to find one for you?” Paul is sa ying that the professor will never discover that this is not his paper, and he t ells Samantha to “wise up.” “To wise up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to unde rstand something about the real world, about the way things really work. We of ten use this expression when

someone seems innocent or what we would describe as  “naïve” (naïve). Someone who's naive is someone who doesn't have a l ot of experience, who thinks things are more honest, perhaps, than they r eally are, or who thinks that people are more honest than they really are.

Paul is saying that Samantha should wise up, and th en offers to find a paper for her. Samantha, however, says, “No way. Not only is it cheating, if you get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.” Samanth a is not going to do what Paul did. She's not going to be dishonest. She's not going to cheat. “To cheat” (cheat) is to get something unfairly, to win a game unfairl y, or to get a grade that you don't deserve because you did something that you we ren't supposed to do.

Samantha says, “If you get caught,” meaning if some one finds out about this bad thing that you did, “you could flunk the class.” “T o flunk” (flunk) means not to pass a class in school, to get what we would call a  failing grade, or a failing mark. Usually, that means getting an “F.” That means that  you failed, that you flunked, that you did not pass the class.

That happened to me a couple of times. I took Germa n once and flunked, but I didn't really complete the course, and then I also took a class in computer programming back in the 1980’s. I believe it was “C OBALT” (Cobalt). I flunked that class, too. So, even professors flunk classes.

Samantha is telling Paul that he will flunk this cl ass if he is caught, or possibly get expelled. To be or to get “expelled” (expelled) mea ns that you are told you must leave the school, leave the university. You can no longer be a student here. It's the worst possible punishment you can get. It means  you can no longer go to school at that place.

Paul is not too worried, however. He says to Samant ha, “Don't be such a goody two-shoes.” This is an old expression – a “goody (g oody) two (two) [-] shoes (shoes).” When you call someone a “goody two-shoes, ” it means that this is a person who always follows the rules. It's an insult ing term, however. It's something that you are saying to criticize someone.  Someone who’s a goody two-shoes is too good, is too honest, is too willin g to follow the rules, instead of doing what everyone else does. Of course, this is a  very relative description; that is, it depends on who you are and what the situatio n is. Usually, however, it is used as an insult, especially among children.

Paul then says that “Everybody does it,” meaning ev erybody cheats. “I know a guy” – I know a man – “who pays somebody in another  state to write all of his papers for him and another guy” – another person – “who lifts his papers from old

books.” Paul is saying he has two friends, or two p eople he knows: one of them pays someone else to write his papers, another one steals his papers from old books. He copies old books.

Paul says, “Don't tell me you've never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your own.” “To paraphrase” (par aphrase) means to express someone else's ideas, but in your own words, using your own words to give the same idea. A “source” (source) is where you get inf ormation from. It could be a book. It could be the Internet. It could be a frien d – all of those could be sources of information. “To represent something” means to p resent it in a certain way. Paul is saying that even Samantha has taken other p eople's ideas and called them her own. She's represented them as her own.

Samantha says, “Are you kidding me?” Are you joking ? She says, “Borrowing ideas from a book with proper attribution is what y ou're supposed to do.” She’s saying that if you take an idea from another source , you need to have proper “attribution” (attribution). “Attribution” is a sta tement indicating where you got this idea from, or where you got this quote from. She sa ys, “You on the other hand are plagiarizing your way to your degree.” Samantha  is saying that Paul is plagiarizing his way to his degree. “To plagiarize”  (plagiarize) means to take someone else's words and use them as if they were y our own, to take someone else's writing and say that it was your writing. Th at is “to plagiarize.” And of course, that is dishonest and not allowed by any sc hool – any good school, anyway. A “degree” (degree) is the same as a diplom a. It's an official piece of paper showing that you have completed your studies at a university or college.

Paul, however, is not going to change his mind. Whe n Samantha says that he's plagiarizing his way to his degree, he says, “Damn straight.” This is somewhat of a vulgar expression. “Damn” (damn) when you say it in anger or in excitement, is a vulgar, impolite phrase. Often, you say it when y ou are angry about something. Here, however, Paul is using it as a way of emphasi zing. “Damn straight” means you are in complete agreement with the other person . You agree with the other person in everything they say. You're saying, “Yes,  that's correct. I agree with you.” But you use it usually in cases where you are  trying to emphasize to the other person how much you agree with that statement .

Again, it's a vulgar expression. You shouldn't use this at work. You shouldn't probably use it at all. You could say, instead of “ Damn straight,” you could say, “Absolutely!” or “Yes, that's absolutely right.”

Paul continues by saying, “Look who’s done with his  homework and who is still working on hers.” He’s saying, “I'm done with my ho mework. You're still working

on your paper.” Samantha says, “I'd rather earn wha t I get and know that I didn't shortchange myself out of an education.” “To earn it” means to get it by working. “To shortchange yourself out of something” means to  give someone less than what they deserve, to cheat someone out of what the y should be getting. “To shortchange someone out of something” is to be dish onest with them. Samantha is saying she doesn't want to shortchange herself  out of an education. She wants to get a real education by doing her own work.

Now let's listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Paul:  All done.

Samantha:  You’re done with your paper?  How can th at be?  I’m just getting started.

Paul:  I’m just a better student than you are.

Samantha:  Let me see that.  You didn’t write this.

Paul:  No, I didn’t.  I downloaded somebody’s paper  from some website and slapped my name on it.  The professor will never kn ow.  Wise up.  Do you want me to find one for you?

Samantha:  No way!  Not only is it cheating, if you  get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.

Paul:  Don’t be such a goody two-shoes.  Everybody does it.  I know a guy who pays somebody in another state to write all of his papers for him and another guy who lifts his papers from old books.  Don’t tell me  you’ve never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your ow n.

Samantha:  Are you kidding me?  Borrowing ideas fro m a book with proper attribution is what you’re supposed to do.  You, on  the other hand, are plagiarizing your way to your degree.

Paul:  Damn straight!  Look who’s done with his hom ework and who is still working on hers.

Samantha:  I’d rather earn what I get and know that  I didn’t shortchange myself out of an education!

She never cheats or plagiarizes. She's an original scriptwriter. I speak, of course, of our wonderful, Dr. Lucy Tse.

This episode is a dialog between Danny and Sybil ab out how you correct someone in a conversation. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Danny:  You look like you need to relax.

Sybil:  Excuse me?

Danny:  What I mean is, you look like you could use  some R and R.

Sybil:  I didn’t know I looked tired and worn out.

Danny:  No, what I’m trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.

Sybil:  Yes, that’s certainly true.

Danny:  The human body needs downtime to recuperate  and to regenerate.

Sybil:  Okay, I guess that’s true.

Danny:  Let me rephrase that.  People need time awa y from work to get ready for more work.

Sybil:  Are you saying you’re planning on giving me  more work?

Danny:  No, no, no.  Let me put it another way.  It ’s imperative that you don’t work this weekend.

Sybil:  Why?  What’s going on this weekend?  Are yo u saying that something big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m  being left out?

Danny:  No, not at all.  What I’m trying to say is. ..[sigh]...would you like to go out with me Saturday night?

Sybil:  Oh, I guess I didn’t catch your drift earli er.  You’re asking me out for Saturday.

Danny:  Yes, I am.

Sybil:  Then, I accept.

Danny:  Really?

Sybil:  Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me  out on a first date ever again!

[end of dialog]

Danny begins a dialog by saying to Sybil, “You look  like you need to relax.” You look like you need to be calmer, less worried, less  anxious. Sybil says, “Excuse me?” The expression “excuse me” is used in a lot of  different ways. Here it's used when someone says something to you and you don 't really understand why they said it. You might also be a little upset or a ngry that they said this to you, so you're indicating your displeasure, the fact that y ou don't like what they said.

That's why Sybil says “Excuse me?” She's not very h appy that Danny has told her that she needs to relax. Danny then corrects hi mself. He says, “What I mean is you look like you could use some R and R.” The p hrase “what I mean is,” is used when you've just said something that the other  person didn't understand, or you don't think the other person understood correct ly, and you want to give another way of saying it. You want to say it in a d ifferent way. So, when Sybil says, “Excuse me,” indicating she didn't like what Danny said, Danny says, “What I mean is, you look like you could use some R and R .” “R and R” stands for “Rest and Relaxation.”

Sybil said, “I didn't know I looked tired and worn out.” Sybil thinks that Danny is criticizing her, in a way, saying that she looks ti red and worn out. “To be worn (worn) out” means to be very tired, both physically  and perhaps mentally. Danny realizes that Sybil still doesn't like the way he e xpressed his idea. So, he uses another phrase to correct himself again.

 He says, “No, what I'm trying to say is, people nee d leisure time once in a while.” “What I'm trying to say is” means the same as “what  I mean is.” It's an expression or a phrase you would use in a conversation when yo u need to correct yourself, or you need to say something in a different way. Da nny says that people need leisure time once in a while. “Leisure” (leisure) m eans time that you do what you enjoy, time that you do some activity that isn't wo rk.

Finally, Sybil seems to understand what he's saying . She says, “Yes, that's certainly true.” Danny continues, “The human body n eeds downtime to recuperate and to regenerate.” He is saying that ou r bodies, our physical bodies, need “downtime.” “Downtime” – one word – is time th at you don't have anything scheduled. It’s time where you are just going to do  whatever you feel like doing. It's similar to leisure, although you could have do wntime at your work, where you don't have anything scheduled. You can relax a litt le, but still have to think of something to do. “Downtime” in this conversation, i n this dialog, means something closer to leisure, relaxation.

“The body needs downtime,” Danny says, “to recupera te.” “To recuperate” (recuperate) means to recover, usually to recover f rom some sort of sickness or illness. In this case, the body needs time to recup erate, to get its energy back. “To regenerate” is another verb that Danny uses her e. “Regenerate” (regenerate) means to become renewed, almost to take on a new li fe. It's not that common of an expression or a verb in cases such as this, but it's possible to say that the body needs time to regenerate. Literally, it means to “make again,” to generate again, to create again.

Sybil says, “Okay. I guess that's true.” Again, Syb il is not perhaps happy with what Danny has said, and Danny sensing this, seeing  this, says, “Let me rephrase that.” “To rephrase” (rephrase) means to e xpress an idea in a different way, especially if the first time you said it wasn' t exactly what you wanted to say or was unclear. This is another way of correcting y ourself, of saying, “Wait a minute. Let me say this in a different way.” Danny says, “Let me rephrase that. People need time away from work to get ready for mo re work.” Now Danny is presenting a little different idea. He’s saying tha t we need down time and leisure so that we can work even more.

Sybil says, “Are you saying you're planning on givi ng me more work?” Now we realize Danny appears to be Sybil’s boss. So, Sybil  asks Danny if he is planning on giving her more work, and that's why he's tellin g her to relax and so forth. Danny says, “No, no, no. Let me put it another way. ” “To put something another way” is to say it in a different way. This is anoth er expression, another phrase

you can use when you want to correct what you just said or when the person misunderstood you. “Let me put it another way.” It means the same as “Let me rephrase that.”

Danny says, “It's imperative that you don't work th is weekend.” Something that is “imperative” (imperative) is something that is extr emely important, something that is necessary, something that is required. Danny is saying, “It's imperative that you do not work this weekend.” Sybil says, “Why?” “ What's going on? – What's happening? – “this weekend? Are you saying that som ething big is happening in the department this weekend and I’m being left out? ” “To be left out” means not to be included in some activity or some discussion.  We could also say “to be excluded.” That's “to be left out.”

Now Sybil is worrying that Danny doesn't want her to be part of something important. Danny says, “No, not at all,” meaning “N o, you're not being left out.” “What I'm trying to say is,” and he sighs – he goes  [sighing] – “would you like to go out with me Saturday night?” Danny, who remember , we think is Sybil’s boss, is asking her out on a date, is asking if she would  like to go and spend time with him this weekend. He said, “Would you like to go ou t with me this weekend?” – Saturday night. “To go out with someone” means to g o on a date with them. I'm not sure if this is a good idea for the boss to be asking one of his employees out on a date. Most companies don't like that. Well, Da nny is doing it anyway!

Sybil says, “Oh, I didn't catch your drift earlier. ” “To catch someone's drift” (drift) is an old expression meaning to understand the main  idea of what someone else is saying, to get the general idea of what another person is telling you. Sybil says she did not catch Danny's drift earlier. She says, “You're asking me out for Saturday.” Danny says, “Yes, I am.”

Sybil says, “Then, I accept.” Danny says, “Really?”  He’s surprised. And he should be. I mean, Danny is not an attractive perso n. I mean, he’s not as good- looking as Sybil. Danny says, “Really?” Sybil says,  “Yes, as long as you promise never to ask me out on a first date ever again.” Sy bil is making a little joke here. Of course, you can only ask someone out on a first date once. You can only do something the first time once. She's also saying th at Danny did not do a very good job on asking her out on this date, and I thin k we can all agree that's true.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Danny:  You look like you need to relax.

 Sybil:  Excuse me?

Danny:  What I mean is, you look like you could use  some R and R.

Sybil:  I didn’t know I looked tired and worn out.

Danny:  No, what I’m trying to say is, people need leisure time once in a while.

# Working as a Lobbyist

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 912 – Working as a Lobbyist.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 912. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Cody and Jada ab out someone who works to try to influence public policy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Cody:  You’re not the kind of person I would expect  to work as a lobbyist.

Jada:  Why not?

Cody:  I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy a nd corrupt, using underhanded tactics.

Jada:  It’s not like that at all, at least not for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.

Cody:  So what do you do exactly?

Jada:  I meet with legislators and try to sway them  to support laws that are favorable to the people and companies I represent, and to discourage them from voting for laws that aren’t.

Cody:  You’re a spokesperson for your clients, then .

Jada:  I’m more than that.  I work for clients in the private sector and in corporations, as well as for special interest group s.  I advocate for what would benefit my clients in a way that they can’t do them selves directly.

Cody:  Isn’t there sometimes a conflict of interest ?  Let’s say your client this month wants a law passed and your client next month  doesn’t.  What happens then?

 Jada:  I’m a gun for hire.  I do my best for my cli ent, whichever that client is at that moment.

Cody:  I’m glad to hear you say that.  I could use the services of a good lobbyist. I’ve been trying to get my wife to agree to buy a n ew boat...

Jada:  Stop right there.  In this case there is a c onflict of interest.  Your wife talked to me last week and wants me to have a littl e talk with you about that new boat...

[end of dialog]

Cody begins by saying, “You're not the kind of pers on I would expect to work as a lobbyist.” A “lobbyist” (lobbyist) is someone who  works with government officials, usually elected government officials, an d tries to get them to vote a certain way on some law or some regulation. “Lobbyi sts” work to try to influence what we call “public policy,” the government's poli cy or the government's actions about a certain topic. Cody is saying to Jada that he did not expect her to work as a lobbyist. I should mention also: the verb is “ to lobby” (lobby). That means to try to influence a government official.

Jada says, “Why not?” Why didn't you expect me to w ork as a lobbyist? Cody says, “I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy a nd corrupt, using underhanded tactics.” The verb “to picture” (picture) means to imagine something in a certain way, to have an image or picture of something in yo ur head. Cody says that he “pictures” lobbyists as being “kind of,” or sort of , or somewhat, “pushy and corrupt.” “To be pushy” (pushy) means to be very as sertive, we might say “aggressive,” forceful, someone who insists on gett ing their way, insists that everyone agree with them. That would be a pushy per son.

“Corrupt” (corrupt) means that you are doing someth ing wrong. You are lying. You are cheating. You are doing something to get in fluence, usually with a government official, although not always. Cody says  that he pictures lobbyists as being pushy and corrupt and using “underhanded tact ics.” A “tactic” (tactic) is an approach, a method or strategy, roughly speaking. “ Underhanded” means dishonest, unfair. We might also use the word “snea ky” (sneaky). “Underhanded tactics” would be doing something in an unfair or d ishonest way.

Jada says, “It's not like that at all, at least not  for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.” This phrase, “power s of persuasion,” refers to your ability to change other people's opinions or d ecisions by telling them

information that will change their mind, or giving them another option, another way of doing whatever they're trying to do. Cody says, “So what do you do exactly?” The word “e xactly means here “precisely,” in detail. Tell me what you do from th is moment to this moment, or this day to this day. Jada says, “I meet with legis lators and try to sway them to support laws that are favorable to the people and c ompanies I represent.” “Legislators” (legislators) are people who are elec ted as representatives of the people. Representatives in a state government or re presentatives in our national government can both be called “legislators.” The ve rb “to legislate” means to make a law. So, legislators are people who make law s.

Jada says, “I meet with legislators and try to sway  them.” “To sway” (sway) means to persuade, to convince, to change someone's  opinion about something. Jada tries to persuade or “sway” these legislators to support laws, or to vote for laws, that are favorable to the people and companie s she represents. “Favorable” (favorable) means useful, beneficial, h elping. We might also use the word “advantageous” – something positive for a cert ain person or group. Jada wants the laws to be favorable to the people she re presents. “To represent” typically means to go in the place of someone else.  So instead of you going and talking to the legislator, you send a representativ e who will “represent” you. The lobbyists represents and works for the people who g ive her money to talk to legislators. Jada says she also works to “discourag e” legislators from voting for laws that are not favorable. “To discourage” means to get them to not  do something.

Cody says, “You're a spokesperson for your clients then?” A “spokesperson” is a general term for someone who speaks for another per son, who speaks in public for another person, someone who might speak to news paper reporters, representing some person or company. That person is  called a “spokesperson.” The traditional words were “spokesman” and “spokesw oman,” but a more general term used sometimes now is “spokes person .”

Jada says, “I'm more than that,” meaning I do more than just speak for my clients or the people I work for. “I work for clients in the private sector and in corporations, as well as for special interest group s.” “The private sector” (sector) refers to businesses and corporations, something th at is not the government. We call the government the “public sector.” The privat e sector is everyone who is not in or part of the government.

Jada says she works for clients in the public secto r and in corporations – although corporations are be part of the private se ctor – as well as for “special interest groups.” A “special interest group” is an organization, usually, that

represents a whole group of companies or group of p eople who have some common interest. For example, there may be many dif ferent companies that grow corn in the United States, many different indi vidual farmers who grow corn. They might have a group that gets together and send s a lobbyist to Washington to try to get laws that will favor those companies and those farmers. That group would be called a “special interest group” because they all have the same interest, the same concern. Jada says that she “adv ocates” for what would benefit her clients. “To advocate” (advocate) means  to speak on behalf of a group of people and say what should be done – to speak for a group of people trying to get changes in the way something works.

Cody says, “Isn’t there sometimes a conflict of int erest?” A “conflict of interest” is a situation where what you say publicly, or what yo u do publicly, may disagree with or cause problems with things you do privately . For example, if I own a bunch of land, a lot of land, in a certain area and  I am also a government representative, for me to pass laws about how that land is going to be used would be a “conflict of interest.” I have two diffe rent things that I'm responsible for: I'm responsible as a government official, but I'm also responsible as a person who owns the land. So, my interests will perhaps co nflict or not agree.

Cody says, “Let's say your client this month wants a law passed, and your client next month doesn't.” Cody is saying that if Jada ha s one company she's working for that wants a law in a certain way, or written i n a certain way, and then the next month she has a new company who wants the law written in a different way, isn't this a conflict of interest? Notice Cody uses  the expression “Let's say.” “Let's say” means, “for example.”

Jada said, “I’m a gun for hire.” This expression “I 'm a gun (gun) for hire (hire)” means literally that you are a person who is given money to go and kill someone, but that's not what Jada is talking about. We use t his expression more generally to mean someone who is given money, who is hired, to solve a certain problem, and this person will work for anyone who wants that  problem solved, even people who have different interests, even when there is a conflict of interest.

Jada says, “I do the best for my client, whichever that client is at that moment,” or at that time. Cody says “I'm glad to hear you say t hat. I could use the services of a good lobbyist. I've been trying to get my wife to  agree to buy a new boat.” Cody is making a joke, of course. You don't send someone  else like a lobbyist to change your wife's mind. The way you do that is by going to the jewelry store. Cody needs to learn a little about marriage here!

Jada says, “Stop right there,” meaning stop talking . “In this case, there is a conflict of interest,” she says. “Your wife talked to me last week and wants me to have a little talk” – or conversation – “with you a bout that new boat.” What she's saying is that Cody's wife talked to her and has al ready asked her to influence Cody, so she can't represent both parties, or both people, at the same time.

Of course, she's making a joke also, because “lobby ist” isn't a word we would use to describe someone in this situation. We use “ lobbyist” only to describe someone who is trying to influence a government off icial, not your wife.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Cody:  You’re not the kind of person I would expect  to work as a lobbyist.

Jada:  Why not?

Cody:  I picture lobbyists as being kind of pushy a nd corrupt, using underhanded tactics.

Jada:  It’s not like that at all, at least not for me. I just use my powers of persuasion to help my clients.

Cody:  So what do you do exactly?

This episode is a dialog between Ashley and Terrell  about something called “motion sickness,” when you get sick inside of a mo ving vehicle. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ashley:  You don’t look so good.  What’s wrong?

Terrell:  I felt motion sickness watching that movi e.  The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.

Ashley:  It didn’t bother me. The hand-held camera used to film the movie had that effect on you?

Terrell:  I’m susceptible to motion sickness.  You should see me on a boat.  The rocking motion makes me seasick and nauseous.  When  I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family took a road trip.  My parents always had a barf bag ready.

 Ashley:  Wow, that sucks.

Terrell:  Yeah, and don’t even try to get me on an airplane.  Just the starting of the engines makes me feel airsick and looking down gives me vertigo.

Ashley:  So how do you travel?

Terrell:  Very rarely and usually with one foot on the ground!

[end of dialog]

Ashley says to Terrell, “You don't look so good,” m eaning you don't look very healthy. You look sick. “What's wrong?” Terrell say s, “I felt motion sickness watching that movie.” “Motion sickness” is a feelin g of what we would call “nausea,” feeling sick in your stomach or sick to  your stomach, caused usually by being in a car, or a boat, or an airplane, or some other vehicle, some other means of transportation.

Terrell, however, was not in a vehicle. He was watc hing a movie, and he says the movie gave him motion sickness. Terrell said, “The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.” Terrell is saying that the camera m oved back and forth suddenly and quickly from one place to another. Tha t's what he means by the phrasal verb “to jerk (jerk) around” – to move quic kly back and forth. This term can also be used informally when you have a situati on where you are, perhaps, not treating someone very well. You tell them one t hing and then five minutes later you tell them another thing. This is especial ly true if you’re a boss, or if you're in charge of another person. “To jerk someon e around” is a very negative way of describing someone's behavior and how they a re treating another person. They're treating them by making decisions that chan ge very quickly.

Terrell is talking about a camera that is moving ba ck and forth. He says the cameras jerking around made him “dizzy” (dizzy). “D izzy” is a feeling in your head that everything is moving or spinning around y ou. When you're dizzy, you feel like you may fall down. If you spin around in a circle ten times, you'll feel dizzy. You'll feel like you might fall down.

Ashley said the movie didn't bother her, didn't aff ect her. She then asks Terrell, “The hand-held camera used to film the movie had th at affect on you?” “Hand- held” is something you hold in one of your hands. A  “camera,” of course, is used to film or to record the movie. So, a “hand-held ca mera” would be a camera used, usually, to make a movie, although it could j ust be a camera used to take

pictures. In some movies nowadays, the makers of the movie will use a hand- held camera because they think perhaps it provides a more “realistic” image for the people watching the movie, although, I’m not a filmmaker, so I can’t give you any exact explanations.

Ashley is asking Terrell if the hand-held camera th at was jerking around had that “effect on you.” “That effect” refers to motion sic kness. An “effect” (effect) is a result or an outcome or a consequence. Terrell says , “I’m susceptible to motion sickness.” When you’re “susceptible (susceptible) to something,” you are very easily affected by it or can easily have a problem with it. “Susceptible” is usually used when talking about, for example, an illness or  a sickness, or something negative in your behavior. Young children may be su sceptible to colds. They may be more likely to get a cold, or a sick person with  an infection is more susceptible to serious health problems, because they are sick. Terrell says he’s susceptible to motion sickness.

He says, “You should see me on a boat.” That expres sion, “you should see me,” means you have to imagine this situation because I would really show you or you would really understand it if you were to see me in  this other situation. For example, you should see me on a bicycle. I am a won derful bicyclist. That’s not true, but the example here is that you can imagine that person, and if you did see the person in that situation, you would realize exa ctly what they're talking about.

Terrell says, “The rocking motion” – on a boat – “m akes me seasick and nauseous.” A “rocking (rocking) motion” is a motion  that goes back and forth many times, usually somewhat slowly. “To be seasick ” (seasick) – one word – means to have motion sickness caused by being on wa ter, by being in a boat or ship. That's “seasick.” It's just the same as motio n sickness. “Motion sickness” is the general term. If you're on a boat, we might cal l it “seasickness.” If you’re in car, it would be to be “carsick,” and so forth.

“Nauseous” as I mentioned earlier, means feeling si ck to your stomach, like you're going to vomit, like you're going to throw u p. Terrell says, “When I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family too k a road trip.” So, now we see that word “carsick” that I just mentioned. That mea ns getting motion sickness by being in a car. A “road trip” is when you take a lo ng driving trip somewhere. The United States is a very big country, and it's popul ar for people to take road trips, to travel to, say, a different state to see a natio nal park, or to visit a different city. These are driving trips that can often take several  days. When I was young boy, my father, who was a schoolteacher, would take us o n road trips in the summer time when he didn't have to work. One road trip was  almost six weeks long. That was a really, really long trip.

 Anyway, Terrell says that his parents always had a “barf bag” ready. A “barf (barf) bag” is a somewhat informal term to describe  a small paper bag that you usually find on an airplane for people who get moti on sickness and are going to be physically sick, who are going to throw up. Thes e bags are used so that you can not make a mess, basically. “Barf” (barf) as a verb means to vomit, but it's a word that is only used informally.

Ashley says, “Wow, that sucks.” This is, again, a very informal use of a verb. “To suck” as a verb here means to be terrible, to be aw ful. It's very informal, and probably not one you'd want to use in a business se tting. Some people still think it's a little vulgar, even. So, I would be careful about using this. It is, however, used commonly in conversation, and you'll certainly  hear it in movies and television shows. When someone says something “suck s,” they mean it's bad. It's very bad.

Terrell agrees. He says, “Yeah, and don't even try to get me on an airplane.” “Don't even try” means, “Do not attempt to (in this  case) get me on an airplane.” Of course, you can imagine that Terrell would get s ick on an airplane as well. He says, “Just the starting of the engines makes me fe el airsick.” The “engines” (engines) are the motors, the machines that give the airplane energy so it can fly. Terrell is saying as soon as the engines start, as soon as they start working, they start running on an airplane, he starts to get airs ick. “Airsickness” is when you have motion sickness on an airplane.

So, now we have “seasick,” “carsick,” and “airsick”  for motion sickness on a boat, in a car, and on an airplane. Terrell says that loo king down gives him “vertigo.” “Vertigo” (vertigo) is a feeling of dizziness cause d by being up at a very high location. If you are in a very tall building, and y ou look out the window down to the street, you might get vertigo. It might cause y ou to be dizzy. There was a famous Alfred Hitchcock movie called Vertigo .

Ashley says, “So, how do you travel?” How do you ge t from one place to another if you always have motion sickness? Terrell says, “ Very rarely,” not very often, “and usually with one foot on the ground,” meaning he walks. He doesn't take any sort of vehicle to get from one place to anothe r.

Now let's listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Ashley:  You don’t look so good.  What’s wrong?

 Terrell:  I felt motion sickness watching that movi e.  The camera jerked around and it made me dizzy.

Ashley:  It didn’t bother me. The hand-held camera used to film the movie had that effect on you?

Terrell:  I’m susceptible to motion sickness.  You should see me on a boat.  The rocking motion makes me seasick and nauseous.  When  I was a kid, I used to get carsick every time my family took a road trip.  My parents always had a barf bag ready.

Ashley:  Wow, that sucks.

Terrell:  Yeah, and don’t even try to get me on an airplane.  Just the starting of the engines makes me feel airsick and looking down gives me vertigo.

Ashley:  So how do you travel?

Terrell:  Very rarely and usually with one foot on the ground!

This episode is a dialogue between Carl and someone  working at a hotel. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

After three days of travel and meetings, I returned  to my hotel room ready for some downtime.  All I wanted was some peace and qui et so I could get a good night’s sleep. ...

[phone rings]  Carl:  Hello.

Hotel staff:  Hello, Mr. Mendez.  I’m calling to we lcome you to our hotel.  I hope you’re finding everything to your satisfaction.

Carl:  Yes, yes.  Everything’s fine.  I just want to get some rest right now.

Hotel staff:  Of course, Mr. Mendez.  If there’s an ything we can do for you, don’t hesitate to ask. ...

I hung up the phone and turned off the ringer.  I d idn’t want any more unsolicited phone calls.  But then, there was a knock on the do or. ...

Hotel staff:  Hello, sir.  I’m here to turn down yo ur bed.  May I come in?

Carl:  I don’t need the bed turned down, thanks. ...

Before I closed the door, I put the do-not-disturb sign on my door.  I wanted no more interruptions.

All of a sudden, a loud alarm went off.  I opened m y door and a hotel employee was explaining that there was a small fire in the k itchen and that the guests were being evacuated.  We would have to leave the buildi ng immediately.

I left my hotel room and wondered if there was a va st conspiracy to rob me of my sleep or if I’m just the unluckiest guy in the worl d!

[end of dialog]

We begin with Carl saying, “After three days of tra vel and meetings” – that is, after three days of traveling and meeting with othe r people – “I returned to my hotel room ready for some downtime.” “Downtime” is where you are able to relax, where you don't have anything scheduled. Carl says,  “All I wanted was some peace and quiet so I could get a good night’s sleep .” The expression “peace (peace) and quiet (quiet)” means a period of time w hen you don't hear any loud noises. You don't hear other people. You have silen ce. That's what peace and quiet is. We often use this expression, “peace and quiet,” when we’re talking about there being noise from your neighbors, or in this case, at a hotel. You want some peace and quiet. You want people to be quiet s o that there is less noise and you can relax.

Carl wants to get a “good night’s sleep.” A “good n ight’s sleep” is a night where you sleep well, where you're not interrupted by noi se in the middle of the night while you're sleeping. Carl then gets a phone call.  Carl says, “Hello” and someone from the hotel staff, someone who works at the hotel, says, “Hello Mr. Mendez, I'm calling to welcome you to our hotel. I hope you're finding everything to your satisfaction.” The hotel staff member is ca lling Carl to make sure everything is “to his satisfaction.” The expression  “to your satisfaction” means that it is doing what you expected it to do, that it is meeting your requirements, that it is meeting your needs.

Carl says, “Yes, yes. Everything is fine. I just wa nt to get some rest now.” The hotel staff member says, “Of course, Mr. Mendez. If  there's anything we can do for you, don't hesitate to ask.” “To hesitate” mean s to not do something, to stop something that you want to do. We use the expressio n “Don't” – do not – “hesitate” to do something when we want to make sur e the other person feels as though they can ask you or do whatever you are tell ing them they can do without any worries, without any problems.

Then Carl says that he “hung up” the phone, he put the phone down, and turned off the “ringer.” The “ringer” is what makes noise inside of a telephone. Back in the old days, there used to be an actual bell in the telephone. If you are old enough, you can remember those kinds of phones. Now  it's all electronic. “To turn off the ringer” would be to turn off the sound  so that when the phone rings, when someone calls you, it doesn't actually make a noise. It doesn't actually ring. “To ring” is to make a noise, usually with a small bell…or big bell.

Carl says, “I didn't want any more unsolicited phon e calls.” “Unsolicited” mean not solicited. “To solicit” means, in general, to a sk for something. “Unsolicited” would be things that you didn't ask for. Carl doesn 't want any unsolicited phone calls, but then he says, “There was a knock on the door.” A “knock” (knock) is the noise that's made when you hit your hand against so me object, usually a piece of wood. So, “knocking on a door” would sound somethin g like [knocks on wood] – something like that.

Then Carl gets up out of bed, I guess, and opens the door. The hotel staff member says, “Hello, sir. I'm here to turn down you r bed.” “To turn down your bed” is what some more expensive hotels do. They co me in and they pull the blankets and the sheets back so that you are able to go and use the bed without any problems. It's often done in order to make sure  that the blanket and the sheets are warm for you when you are ready to actua lly go to bed. This is something that is done, as I say, at more expensive  hotels, not the ones that I stay at.

Carl says, “I don't need the bed turned down. Thank s.” He says, “Then, before I closed the door, I put the do-not-disturb sign my d oor.” “To disturb” (disturb) means to bother someone, to interrupt them. “Do not  disturb” means do not bother me. Do not interrupt me. A “do-not-disturb” sign is a little, usually piece of plastic, that you put on the door handle of your ho tel door telling the people who work for the hotel that you don't want them to knoc k on the door. You don't want them to disturb you. This is a good idea if you wan t to sleep and you don't want the hotel staff to wake you up early in the morning  or as we see here, to bother you late at night.

Carl says, “I wanted no more interruptions.” An int erruption is when someone or something stops you from doing what you're doing. “ Interruptions” often cause us to lose our focus. We can't focus on what we're doi ng. We can't concentrate on what we're doing. Carl says, “All of a sudden” – su ddenly – “a loud alarm went off.” An “alarm” (alarm) is a very loud noise. “To go off” is a two-word phrasal verb that, in this case, means “to sound.” When the  alarm begins to make a noise, we would say it “goes off.” “Go off” as a ph rasal verb can be used in a

couple of different ways. You can “go off on  someone.” That would mean yell at someone, make a lot of noise by yelling and screami ng at someone with whom you're angry. “To go off” can also mean to leave. “ I'm going to go off and be by myself.”

Carl says that he opened his door after the alarm w ent off, and a hotel employee – someone who works for the hotel – was explaining that there was a small fire in the kitchen, and that the guests – the people stayi ng at the hotel – “were being evacuated.” “To be evacuated” (evacuated) means to be told that you have to leave the place where you are, usually because ther e's something dangerous that might happen to you.

For example, if there is a flood near your home, wh ere a river has too much water and so the water starts to go on the other pa rts of the land, you might be asked to evacuate, to leave your house, because it' s dangerous if you stay there. Carl says, “We would have to leave the building imm ediately.” That's what he was told by the hotel employee. He said he left his  hotel room and wondered if there was a “vast conspiracy to rob” him of his sle ep. “Vast” (vast) means very large or extensive. “Conspiracy” (conspiracy) is a secret plan that two or more people have to do something bad, to do something wr ong, usually against the law. A “vast conspiracy to rob” him would be a cons piracy to take something away from him. “To rob (rob) someone” means to stea l something from someone.

Carl is making a joke here. He doesn't really belie ve there is a vast conspiracy to rob him of his sleep. He doesn't believe that all of the employees at the hotel are secretly trying to keep him from sleeping. He says he wonders if there was a vast conspiracy to rob him of his sleep, or if he's just  the “unluckiest guy in the world.” “To be unlucky” means to have bad luck, to have bad  things happen to you, and that certainly is the case with poor Carl.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

After three days of travel and meetings, I returned  to my hotel room ready for some downtime.  All I wanted was some peace and qui et so I could get a good night’s sleep. ...

This episode is a dialog between Mike and Grace, ab out learning to read music, learning to look at a piece of paper that has notes  on it and be able to understand what it means. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Mike:  You have a great voice.  You should join our  choir.

Grace:  I don’t know anything about music.  I can’t  even read music.

Mike:  It’s not that hard.  I could teach you.  Loo k, this is a piece we’re working on right now.

Grace:  What’s that weird thing at the beginning?

Mike:  That’s the clef.  It tells you which note ea ch line and space on the staff represents.

Grace:  Okay.  What about these numbers?

Mike:  That’s the time signature.  It tells you how  many beats are in each measure, and what kind of note gets one beat.  This  little number above there gives you the tempo.

Grace:  Hmm, that’s kind of complicated.  Why are a ll of these notes stacked on top of each other?

Mike:  That’s to indicate a chord, with two or more  notes played together at the same time.  See?  Musical notation is really very s imple.

Grace:  I don’t think I got all that.

Mike:  I’m happy to help you until you get the hang  of it.  We could even work on some duets.  We could sing harmony or I can accompa ny you on the piano.

Grace:  I think you’re overestimating my singing ab ility, but I’m willing to give it a try.  At least, I think I can stay on pitch.  I jus t don’t want to embarrass myself too much.

Mike:  I think you’re overestimating the quality of  our community choir!

[end of dialog]

This dialogue introduces us to a lot of music-relat ed vocabulary. We begin by Mike saying to Grace, “You have a great voice. You should join our choir.” A “choir” (choir) is a group of people who sing toget her. You can have a choir of ten people. You could have a choir of a hundred people.  Grace says, “I don't know anything about music. I can't even read music.” “To  read music” means to be able to understand written music, music on a piece of paper, and convert that, if you will, into actual sound, either by singing or b y playing an instrument – or you can just read music to figure out what something mi ght sound like.

Mike says, “It's not that hard.” It's not very diff icult. “I could teach you. Look, this is a piece we’re working on right now.” A “piece (p iece) of music” is one song, one composition, one thing that you are going to si ng. A “piece of music” could be something you also play with a musical instrumen t – or both singing and musical instruments. The word “piece” is used in a lot of different areas of art. We can talk about a piece of art, meaning a painting, or a sculpture, or anything that you would classify as art.

Mike says he can teach Grace how to read music. He gives her a piece of paper and Grace says, “What's that weird thing at the beg inning?” Mike says, “That's the clef.” A “clef” (clef) is a musical term, as are most of the terms we’re going to be using in this dialog. A “clef” is a written symb ol that indicates the meaning of other symbols on the page of written music. There is normally either a “treble clef,” as it's called, or a “bass clef.” The “trebl e (treble) clef” is sometimes also called the “G clef,” I guess, and the “bass clef” is sometimes called the “F clef.” However, I'm not a musician. I'm just reading this from a piece of paper because I don't know that much about music, but our wonderf ul scriptwriter does. So, she's helping me with this.

Mike says “That's the clef,” the little symbol at the beginning of the piece of music as it's written down on a piece of paper. Mike says , “The clef tells you which note each line and the space on the staff represents.” I n written music, there are lines and then there are spaces in between the lines. I b elieve there are typically five lines, five black lines, and then you have spaces i n between the lines. The clef tells you which notes go on which lines or which sp aces.

Mike talks about the spaces on the “staff” (staff).  The staff is what we call those five horizontal, parallel lines that we write the m usical notes on or that we use to indicate which musical notes you're supposed to sin g or play. A “note” (note) is a musical sound. “Do re mi fa so la ti do, do re mi f a so la ti do.” I don't know if that was actually the correct musical notes in English. I'm not sure about other languages, but I believe it is probably the same. W e have words that we use to represent each note.

“Notes,” when written on a staff, usually consist of round circles, sometimes the circles are empty, sometimes they're blackened in. The circles often have a line attached to them, going up or down, and the lines themselves often have other small lines that go off of the larger line. That's how we write notes, and depending on what the circle looks like and how man y lines you have, you indicate different kinds of notes.

However, the sound of the note is indicated by wher e it is on the staff. If it's on the top of the staff, it's higher than it is if it were on the bottom of the staff. Grace says, “Okay. What about these numbers?” Mike says, “That's the time signature.” The time signature are two numbers, one on top of the other, on a musical staff that are used to show how many beats are in each gr oup of notes – that's the top number – and which note gets the beat – that's the bottom number. For example, if you see a four and then another four underneath it, that would be a “four over four time signature.” There are four beats per sect ion of music – that little section is usually called a “measure” – and in a four-four time signature, the quarter note gets the beat. If it were three over four, then the re would only be three beats in the measure.

A “beat” is a evenly-spaced rhythmic sound in music . That's the technical definition, I guess. The beat is usually indicated,  in a rock band, for example, by either the drum or the bass guitar. In certain kind s of dances, where people dance to the music, you will see people counting the beat. For example, if you are dancing the waltz and it had a beat of one-two- three, one-two-three, one-two- three, one-two-three – people actually count that to make sure that they are dancing correctly. That one-two-three, one-two-thre e that you are hearing in the music is the “beat.”

 Mike says that “The time signature tells you how ma ny beats are in each measure.” “Measure,” remember, is a small group of notes that has the same number of beats. When you look at a musical staff, measures are separated by a vertical line - the line that goes up and down.

Mike says that the time signature tells you how man y beats are in each measure and what kind of note gets one beat. “This little n umber above there gives you the tempo.” The “tempo” (tempo) is sort of like the  speed of the song. It's how many beats per minute are in the piece of music. So mething that has a very fast tempo goes very quickly. What we call a “fast song”  goes by quickly, what we call a “slow song” goes or seems to go more slowly.

Grace says “Hmm, that's kind of complicated. Why are all these notes stacked on top of each other?” “To stack” (stack) means to put  one thing on top of another. Grace wants to know why the musical notes on the st aff are stacked one on top of the other. Mike says, “That's to indicate a chor d.” A “chord” (chord) is a group of two or more notes that are played at the same ti me. If you are singing, you can't sing a chord by yourself, technically. There would have to be other people singing with you. Some musical instruments such as a piano can play a chord because you can play more than one note at a time.

Mike says, “See? Musical notation is very simple.” “Musical notation” is just another word for written music, the way that we typ ically write music down on a piece of paper. Grace says, “I don't think I got al l that,” meaning I don't think I understood everything you just explained to me.

Maybe Grace isn’t too smart. Maybe, maybe she shoul dn't be singing. Well, let’s continue here. Mike says, “I'm happy to help you un til you get the hang of it.” “To get the hang of something” is to get used to someth ing. We could even work on some duets. A “duet” (duet) is when two people sing  together. “Due” is Italian for two. I’m not sure if that's where “duet” comes from  – probably. A lot of the words we use in music with our musical notation are in It alian.

Mike says, “We could sing harmony or I can accompan y you on the piano.” To be in “harmony” means to have two or more notes played  at the same time that sound good together. “Accompany” means to play a mu sical instrument while another person sings. So, I'm playing the piano, an d you’re singing. I'm “accompanying” your singing.

Grace says, “I think you're overestimating my singi ng ability.” “To estimate” means to guess. “To overestimate” means to have a h igher opinion of something

than it deserves, or to think that something is gre ater than it actually is. The opposite of “overestimate” is “underestimate.” “To underestimate” means to think something is less important, or not as good as what  it in fact is. Grace says, “I'm willing to give it a try.” I'm willing to try it. “ At least, I think I can stay on pitch.” “To be on pitch” (pitch) means the same as to be in tun e, when you sing a note the way it's supposed to be sung – not too high, which is what we would call “sharp,” or too low, which is what we would call “flat.” I a m rarely on pitch when I sing.

Grace says, “I just don't want to embarrass myself too much.” Mike says, “I think you're overestimating the quality of our community choir.” Mike is saying that the choir really isn't very good and so even if Grace i sn’t perfect, she'll be just fine.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Mike:  You have a great voice.  You should join our  choir.

This episode is a dialogueue between Julianna and H ugo about someone being forced out or forced to leave their position. Let's  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julianna: Ha ha! The wicked witch is dead!

Hugo: What are you talking about?

Julianna: Bettina is stepping down as chairperson of the committee. I thought this day would never come.

Hugo: That’s a big surprise. I never thought I’d li ve to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.

Julianna: It wasn’t her choice exactly. The rest of  the committee forced her out, saying they couldn’t work with her anymore. Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Hugo: But I thought she had the support of the high er-ups and they wanted her in the position.

Julianna: Well, she’s somehow fallen from grace and  they can’t wait to see the back of her. It’s nice to see her get her comeuppan ce – finally!

Hugo: Maybe we’re not getting the full story. Maybe  she had personal reasons for leaving.

Julianna: Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid of her once and for all. Hallelujah!

Hugo: How do you know the next chairperson won’t be  worse?

Julianna: Bite your tongue!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Julianna saying, “Ha ha! T he wicked witch is dead!” The “wicked (wicked) witch (witch)” is a reference to a famous movie from the 1930’s called The Wizard of Oz . In the movie, there was an evil or bad character who was called the “Wicked Witch.” A “witch” is a w oman who is said to have magical powers. “To be wicked” means to be bad. It' s an old word for someone who is bad.

So, a “wicked witch” would be an evil witch, in this case, an evil woman. Now, one of the lines in the movie, I don't want to tell  you what happens at the end of the movie, but one of the lines in the movie is “Th e wicked witch is dead!” We're guessing that Julianna is referring to someone who is not a witch, and is probably not dead, but in this case, is no longer in their p osition. And that's what Hugo asks her about.

Hugo says “What are you talking about?” Julianna sa ys, “Bettina is stepping down as chairperson of the committee.” “To step dow n” is a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to voluntarily leave your position. You could be the president of a company and then decide to “step down,” to resign, to leave your position.

Julianna says that “Bettina is stepping down as cha irperson of the committee.” We’re not sure what the committee is, but the Betti na is the chairperson. Since Bettina is a woman, we could also call her the “cha irwoman.” Julianna says, “I thought this day would never come.” That expression , “I thought this day would never come,” means you have difficulty believing th at something has actually happened. You wanted it to happen for a very long t ime and now it happens, and you're surprised.

Hugo says, “That's a big surprise. I never thought I'd live to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.” The expression, “I never thought I'd live to see the day,” is similar to the previous ex pression, “I thought this day would never come.” You're saying that you are very surprised that something has actually happened because, again, you were waiting for it for a long time and now it has happened.

Hugo says that he never thought he'd see the day wh en Bettina would willingly, that is, voluntarily, not like being forced, give u p her position. “To give up something” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to de cide no longer to use it, or to stop using something. “I'm going to give up drin king coffee in the mornings.”

I'm going to stop drinking coffee in the mornings. When we use the verb that way, there is this notion of a sacrifice. I'm going to s acrifice voluntarily and give up a certain activity. Here, it means basically to no lo nger be in a position, to resign, to step down.

Julianna says, “It wasn't her choice exactly.” That  means it wasn't voluntary – completely, anyway. That's what Julianna means when  she says, “It wasn't her choice exactly.” “The rest of the committee” – the other members of the committee – “forced her out, saying they couldn't w ork with her anymore.” “To force someone out” is to make someone leave a posit ion either in business or in politics, or in, perhaps, some other position of au thority.

When a politician is forced out of office, he is ma de to resign or leave his position by people who don't want him there. Bettina was for ced out of her position as chairwoman of the committee. Julianna says, “Oh, ho w the mighty have fallen!” This is an old expression that refers to a verse or  a sentence in the Bible describing how someone who was very strong and powe rful suddenly loses their power. “To fall” here means to no longer be powerfu l, to no longer be in your position. “Mighty” (mighty) describes someone who is powerful, who is strong. So, the expression, “Oh, how the mighty have fallen ” means that someone who is very powerful is now suddenly not powerful.

Hugo says, “But I thought she had the support of the higher-ups.” The expression “the higher-ups” refers to people who are at the to p of an organization in terms of the management, the people who are the leaders or the bosses. Those of the “higher-ups.” Hugo says he thought Bettina had the support of the higher-ups, of the bosses, and that they wanted her in the positio n.

Julianna says, “Well, she's somehow fallen from gra ce and they can't wait to see the back of her.” “To fall from grace” is to do som ething that makes other people unhappy with you. Another way of saying this would be “to fall out of favor” (favor). “To fall from grace,” or “to fall out of f avor,” is to be in a high position, or a position where you are respected and everyone likes  you, to a position where you do something bad, and now nobody likes you, and  perhaps you've lost your power or your position.

Julianna says that the “higher-ups” – the bosses – “can't wait to see the back of her.” When you “can't wait to” do something, you ve ry much want to do it. You are eager to do it. You want to do it right away, i f possible. In this case, the bosses can't wait to see the back of Bettina. “To s ee the back of someone” means to want to see someone leave. If someone leav es, they turn around and walk away from you and what do you see? You see the  back of that person. So,

the expression “they can't wait to see the back of her” means they are very eager for her to leave. They want her to leave as soon as  possible.

Julianna says, “It's nice to see her get her comeup pance – finally!” This is a somewhat unusual word, “comeuppance” (comeuppance).  “Comeuppance” is a punishment for something that you did wrong. It's s omething that you deserve because you've been doing something wrong, and ther efore need to be punished. It's typically used in referring to peopl e who think they are superior to everyone else, who think they're better than everyo ne else, and then they do something wrong and they lose their power, or they “fall from grace,” we might say. That would be getting your “comeuppance.” You have some sort of punishment for doing something wrong after having t hought that you were better than everyone else.

Hugo says, “Maybe we're not getting the full story. ” The “full story” here means the entire truth, the entire story, everything that  could be known about the situation. Hugo says, “Maybe she had personal reaso ns for leaving.” “Personal reasons” would be perhaps some problem with her fam ily, or she was sick, or something like that, something that was not related  to her job performance.

Julianna says, “Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid of her once and for all.” “To be rid (rid) of someone” means to no longer have someo ne, or it could also be used to mean to no longer have something, especially som ething that you don't like. “We are now rid of the neighbor next door who had a  loud, barking dog.” The neighbor moved out, left, and now we are “rid of” them. We no longer have to have them next to us.

“Once and for all” means finally and completely. We  use this phrase when something has happened that you have been waiting f or, or anticipating, for a long time, and that is now complete and over – “onc e and for all.” Julianna says, “We’ll be rid of Bettina once and for all. Halleluj ah!” “Hallelujah” (hallelujah) is an old phrase, an old word to express joy, happiness, when something very good happens. You'll often see this word used in a relig ious context. “Hallelujah” is wonderful, great, that's what Juilianna means by it .

Hugo says, “How do you know the next chairperson wo n't be worse?” – in other words, the person who comes after Bettina could be worse than Bettina. Julianna says, “Bite your tongue.” That expression, “bite (b ite) your tongue,” means “Stop talking immediately.” We say this when someone is s aying something bad that we don't want to hear, or someone is predicting som ething bad that will happen, and you don't want them to talk about it anymore be cause you don't want it to happen. The phrase can also be used simply to mean to be quiet, to not say

something, even though you could say something. “I' m going to bite my tongue when my sister-in-law comes over.” I'm not going to  say the things I want to say that might make her angry, or might make my wife an gry. That's more important.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Julianna: Ha ha! The wicked witch is dead!

Hugo: What are you talking about?

Julianna: Bettina is stepping down as chairperson of the committee. I thought this day would never come.

Hugo: That’s a big surprise. I never thought I’d li ve to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.

Julianna: It wasn’t her choice exactly. The rest of  the committee forced her out, saying they couldn’t work with her anymore. Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Hugo: But I thought she had the support of the high er-ups and they wanted her in the position.

Julianna: Well, she’s somehow fallen from grace and  they can’t wait to see the back of her. It’s nice to see her get her comeuppan ce – finally!

Hugo: Maybe we’re not getting the full story. Maybe  she had personal reasons for leaving.

Julianna: Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid of her once and for all. Hallelujah!

Hugo: How do you know the next chairperson won’t be  worse?

Julianna: Bite your tongue!

This episode is a dialog between Patricia and Ed ab out some of the names and terms we use in describing family members. Let's ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party. I got some nametags with “father,” “mother,” and “kids” p rinted on them, with a space for people to write their names. It’ll be easier for people to introduce themselves and make friends.

Ed: The nametags are a good idea, but we have to ke ep in mind that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families . We won’t just have nuclear or traditional families coming.

Patricia: I don’t see how that makes a difference.

Ed: Don’t you? What if we have same-sex families? W e need to be ready to hand out two “father” or two “mother” nametags. There are also a lot of stepfamilies with more than one set of parents.

Patricia: Well, the men are all “fathers” and the “ women” are all mothers – that’s simple. I still don’t see the problem.

Ed: What if the children are being raised by grandp arents? Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women grandmo thers.

Patricia: Okay, we might have some of those familie s.

Ed: And don’t forget that some parents are divorced  or are single parents. Their current partner may not be their spouse. It wouldn’ t be appropriate to give them

“father” or “mother” nametags. We might even get fo ster families, in which case, the nametags may not be applicable at all.

Patricia: I give up. Forget I ever brought up these  nametags. I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them.

Ed: That’s a good idea. Given the complexity we liv e in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go!

[end of dialogue]

Patricia begins our dialog by saying to Ed, “Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party.” Apparently they're hav ing a party for the people who live around their house, in their neighborhood. Pat ricia says, “I got some nametags with ‘father,’ ‘mother,’ and ‘kids’ printe d on them with a space for people to write their names.” A “nametag” (nametag)  is usually a small piece of paper, or something that you write on that has your  name. You usually put it on your shirt at a party where perhaps people aren’t g oing to know each other, and so this helps people know what other people's names  are. This is very common at large events, such as conferences and convention s.

Patricia is not having a convention. She’s just hav ing a neighborhood party, and she wants these nametags to say “father,” “mother” and “kids.” Ed says, “The nametags are a good idea.” He likes that idea, “but ,” he says, “we have to keep in mind” – we have to remember – “that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families.” “In this day and age” mea ns nowadays, in the current period, or we might even say, “in modern times.” Us ually, we use this phrase when we’re about to talk about something that has c hanged in society, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

Ed says, “There are a lot of unconventional familie s.” “Conventional” (conventional) means traditional, normal, expected – what you would expect in this situation. “Unconventional” means not  conventional, something you wouldn't normally expect in a situation. Ed uses this adject ive to describe families nowadays. The traditional family, the conventional family, was always a father, a mother, and child or children. Now we have “unconve ntional families,” and that's what we're talking about here in this dialog.

Ed says, “We won't just have nuclear or traditional  families coming.” The “nuclear family” refers traditionally to the father, the mot her, and the children. It's the traditional family, the family that has been most c ommon in the last, I don't know,

,000 years. Ed says that “we will not just have t hose kinds of traditional families coming to the party.”

Patricia says, “I don't see how that makes a differ ence.” I don't see why that is important. Ed says, “Don't you?” He’s surprised tha t she doesn't. “What if we have same-sex families?” One of the more recent cha nges in some countries, in Europe and parts of the United States, has been for  the government to recognize marriage as being not just between a man and a woma n, but possibly between two men or two women. This is obviously very contro versial. A lot of people don't like this change, but it is a change that has taken  place, and so we need to know how to describe it. And when you read about it, usu ally, the phrase that you will see will be “same-sex.” A “same-sex couple” would b e two people who are of the same sex – two men or two women. So, a “same-sex fa mily” would not be a family where everyone is the same sex. You might ex pect that, but instead it means that the leaders of the family are both of the same sex. The children, of course, could be of different sexes.

Ed says, “We need to be ready to hand out” – or to give – “two father or two mother nametags.” Again the traditional use of the word “father” and “mother” refer to their biological functions. You can only h ave one father, and one mother, but here we're using the term more loosely to descr ibe two heads of the family, neither of which could be (potentially) the biologi cal father or mother.

Ed says, “There are a lot of stepfamilies with more  than one set of parents.” A “stepfamily” is a family where the mother or the fa ther has married again to another person, who is not the mother or father of their children. So, a mother and a father get married. They have a child. They g et divorced, and the mother remarries another man, and that man legally becomes  the father of the children. We would call him the “stepfather.” So, a stepfamil y is a family that either the parents divorced and remarried – one of the parents  divorced and remarried – or perhaps the person was never married before, had a child (the woman) and then married. That might also be a stepfamily.

Patricia says, “Well, the men are all fathers and the women are all mothers – that's simple.” Of course, that's not true in a bio logical sense. Patricia says, “I still don't see the problem.” I still don't understand wh at the problem is.

Ed says, “What if the children are being raised” – are being brought up – “by grandparents?” “Your grandparents” are the mother a nd father of your mother and father. So, your mother has two parents, your f ather has two parents – those are your “grandparents.” Ed says, “Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women, grandmothers.”

 Patricia says, “Okay, we might have some of those f amilies.” Ed also says that there could be some parents who come who are divorc ed, or who are single parents. “To be divorced” means that you legally en d your marriage. The person that you said you were going to live with until you  die…well, you don't. You get divorced and then you can go out and find a new per son that you will live with until you die.

Ed says that there will be divorced parents and sin gle parents. A “single parent” would be a man or a woman who is raising his child or his children by himself, or herself, without the help of the other parent. Sing le-parent families are typically women who have children without getting married, bu t it could also be a man who has a child with another woman and the woman le aves, or dies, or something, and the father raises the child. There a re all sorts of possibilities in modern life, and that is one of them.

Ed continues, “Their” – meaning the parent who is d ivorced or who is a single parent – “current partner may not be their spouse.”  Your “partner” (partner) is a very general term to describe someone with whom you  are in a romantic relationship. It could be a girlfriend. It could be  a boyfriend. It could be a husband. It could be a wife. The term could apply to any of those cases.

Ed says, the current partner of the single parent o r divorced parent may not be their spouse. The word “spouse” (spouse) refers to someone's husband or wife. You have to be married to have a spouse, but you do n't have to be married to have a partner. Generally speaking, when someone in troduces you to their “partner,” they are not talking about their spouse.  They could be, but if the person is married, you would just say, “Well, this is my h usband,” or “This is my wife,” or, “This is my spouse.” You probably wouldn't call the m “partner.” “Partner” is just a term that has been used in the last 20, 30 years or  so because there are so many people who are involved in romantic relationsh ips who are not married.

Ed says, “It wouldn't be appropriate to give these people ‘father’ or ‘mother’ nametags. We might even get foster families, in whi ch case the nametags may not be applicable at all.” A “foster (foster) famil y” is a family where the children aren’t legally the children of the two parents or the parent that is taking care of them. What happens is that, unhappily, in some fami lies, the parents are not able to or unwilling to take care of their children, and  so the government takes the children from the families and gives them to other parents who take care of them. They don't legally become the children of those “fo ster parents,” as we call them, but they are raised by them. They are helped by the m.

Ed says, “We might even get foster families, in whi ch case, the nametags may not be applicable at all.” “In which case” means in  that situation, or under those circumstances. “Applicable” means that it applies to them, that it is appropriate for them. If they’re foster parents, then the terms  “mother” and “father” may not be considered appropriate for them.

Patricia says, “I give up.” When someone says “I gi ve up,” they mean, “I'm not going to try anymore,” usually because something is  too difficult for you to do. Patricia says, “Forget I ever brought up these name tags.” “To bring up” here, as a phrasal verb, means to begin to talk about someth ing, to mention something. Patricia is saying, “Just forget I even started tal king about nametags.” “I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them” – blank.” “Blank” (blank) means nothing is written on the piece of paper. The piece of paper, or possibly the screen on your computer, is empty. We would say it is “blank.” “Bl ank” is normally used for talking about pieces of paper, however.

Ed says, “That's a good idea. Given the complexity we live in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go.” “Complexity” an d “simplicity” are opposite ideas. “Complexity” refers to how difficult or comp licated something is. “Simplicity” refers to how easy to understand, or h ow easy to control, a situation is. “Simplicity” comes from the word “simple.” “Com plexity” comes from the word “complex.” These are opposite ideas.

Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Okay, we’re nearly done setting up for the neighborhood party. I got some nametags with “father,” “mother,” and “kids” p rinted on them, with a space for people to write their names. It’ll be easier for people to introduce themselves and make friends.

Ed: The nametags are a good idea, but we have to ke ep in mind that in this day and age, there are a lot of unconventional families . We won’t just have nuclear or traditional families coming.

Patricia: I don’t see how that makes a difference.

Ed: Don’t you? What if we have same-sex families? W e need to be ready to hand out two “father” or two “mother” nametags. There are also a lot of stepfamilies with more than one set of parents.

 Patricia: Well, the men are all “fathers” and the “ women” are all mothers – that’s simple. I still don’t see the problem.

Ed: What if the children are being raised by grandp arents? Some of the men could be grandfathers and some of the women grandmo thers.

Patricia: I give up. Forget I ever brought up these  nametags. I’ll get blank ones with nothing on them.

Ed: That’s a good idea. Given the complexity we liv e in today, choosing simplicity might be the way to go!

# Preparing for a Disaster

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 918 – Preparing for a Disaster.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 918. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. If you do, you can  become a member of ESL Podcast and help support us.

This episode is a dialogue between Lilly and Paul a bout getting ready for something disastrous, something very bad that might  happen in the future. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lilly: Quick, we need to go get some supplies. I wa s listening to talk radio on my way home from work, and this guy was on talking abo ut how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.

Paul: Oh no, not this again. You have to stop liste ning to that garbage on the radio. Listen, there is no impending doom, and this  guy was just crying wolf.

Lilly: No, he wasn’t. He had proof that the world is going to end soon and he was sounding the alarm. Those people killed in the stor m last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine. Disaster is coming!

Paul: Let me be the voice of reason for a minute. H ow many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?

Lilly: A few times, but this is for real. There’ll be a disruption of services, a run on food and water, and chaos!

Paul: Let me ask you this: if the world is ending, aren’t we all just going to die?

Lilly: Not if you have an underground bunker. Start  digging!

[end of dialogue]

Lilly begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “Quick ” – meaning do this quickly – “we need to go get some supplies.” “Supplies” are m aterials you use to do something else. Lilly says, “I was listening to tal k radio on my way home from work and this guy” – this man – “was on” – was on the radio – “talking about how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.” So, Lil ly was driving home from work, and she was listening to “talk radio.” “Talk radio” refers to radio programs that don't have music but have people who are being  interviewed or people who are talking, usually giving their opinions about so mething. In the United States, in the last 30 years or so, talk radio has become very  popular, especially for political people – people who have strong political opinions,  whether they're conservative or liberal. You can find a talk radio station that has mostly people who are on there talking about their political views. Many peo ple associate talk radio, also, with not being very reliable, with having people on  there who have very extreme views – views or opinions about things that are not  ones that the majority of people would have.

This is what has happened to Lilly. She was listeni ng to talk radio and some man, some guy, was on the radio – was on the radio progr am – talking about “doomsday.” “Doomsday” (doomsday) is the word we gi ve for the day that the world will end. At some point in our future, someth ing bad will happen and we will all die – the entire human race will die. That will  be the “doomsday.” “Doom” (doom) is something bad – death, destruction.

Paul says, “Oh no, not this again.” That expression , “not this again,” means or implies that this is not the first time that Lilly has had this idea or has had a strange idea. Paul says, “You have to stop listenin g to that garbage on the radio.” “Garbage” (garbage) normally refers to something th at is worthless, something that has no value. We might also use the word “tras h.” In other English-speaking countries, they use the term “rubbish” (rubbish). I n the U.S., we use more commonly the word “garbage.” Paul is referring here  to things that are not worth listening to. He's talking about the garbage on the  radio. He means that the people who are on there are idiots, that they're sa ying stupid things. Paul says, “Listen, there is no impending doom, and this guy w as just crying wolf.” “Impending” (impending) is something that will happ en soon, usually something negative that will happen soon. Paul is saying that  there is no impending doom. There is nothing bad that is about to happen.

He says, “This guy was just crying wolf.” The expre ssion “to cry (cry) wolf (wolf)” refers to an old story about the boy who cried wolf . This might even be one of the stories from Aesop, from the ancient world, from an cient Greece. “To cry wolf” means to refer to or to say that something bad is g oing to happen as a joke, as a

trick. If you cry wolf, you are saying something bad is going to happen even when you know that it's not true.

In the original story, the boy was out to protect the sheep and other animals. If the boy saw a wolf, he was supposed to yell very lo udly – to cry, which means here to yell very loudly – “Wolf!” so that all of the other adults would come and kill the wolf and protect the sheep. Well, the boy was l onely and wanted some attention. So, he cried wolf even though there was no wolf, and of course all the people came running. Well, he did this once. He did  it twice. The third time he did it, there really was a wolf, but no one believed hi m – no one came running – because he had already cried wolf twice and it was just a joke. It was something that wasn't true.

The general idea, then, of this expression is that if you say something is true and it’s not, and you keep doing that, eventually peopl e will not believe you. That's what Paul is saying that the guy on talk radio is d oing. He's crying wolf. He's saying something bad will happen when he knows that  there is nothing bad that will happen.

Lilly says, “No, he wasn't. He had proof that the w orld is going to end soon.” “Proof” (proof) is evidence. It's something that te lls you something is true. Lilly says the man “was sounding the alarm.” “To sound the alarm” means to warn people about some danger, about some problem. Lilly  says, “Those people killed in the storm last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine.”

This is another expression that refers to an old co ncept. A “canary” is a kind of bird. “Coal” (coal) is a very hard, black substance  that you dig out of the ground to use as fuel, to use for energy. A “mine” (mine) is when you dig holes in the ground to get coal or some other object that is ins ide of the earth. In the old days, they used to put a canary inside of a coal mine, be cause if the canary smelled gas the canary would die, and that would be an earl y indicator that there was a problem – that there was gas and that the men who w ere working in the coal mine should leave. So, the canary was like a warnin g sign, a warning system that told you that there was a problem.

Lilly is saying that the people who were killed in this storm in the story last week were canaries in the coal mine. They were indicatin g that there was a greater danger to the rest of us. She says, “Disaster is co ming.” “Disaster” is something horrible, something very bad that is going to hurt or kill many people. Sometimes, we use disaster to refer to something that's really  bad – a very bad situation or even a very bad movie. If you say, “That movie was a disaster,” you mean it was a very poorly made movie, not a good movie at all.

 Paul says, “Let me be the voice of reason for a min ute.” “The voice of reason” is the person who is calm, the person who is logical. Paul says, “How many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?” Paul is asking Lilly how many times she has had this idea t hat the world was going to end soon. Lilly says, “A few times, but this is for  real.” This is actually going to happen, she says.

Lilly says that there will be “a disruption of serv ices, a run on food and water, and chaos.” A “disruption” (disruption) is an interrupt ion in something, a temporary stop of something. In this case, it will be a disru ption of services, which might refer to electricity, or water, or transportation –  anything required for us to survive. The expression “a run on something” refers  to a situation where everyone goes out and tries to buy the same kind of  thing. So, if there's going to be a lot of rain, there might be a run on umbrellas . “Umbrellas” are things we use to protect ourselves from the rain. Everyone is going to go out and try to buy umbrellas. There's going to be a run on umbrellas. “Chaos” (chaos) is a general word referring to lack of order. We might even use the word “disorder,” a situation where no one is in control, where the world is with out any sort of authority, everything is going wrong, and there is no one ther e to take care of it.

Paul says, “Let me ask you this: if the world is en ding, aren't we all just going to die?” Paul is asking why they should do anything if  the world is going to end. There's nothing we can do to stop it. Lilly, howeve r, doesn't agree. She says, “Not if you have an underground bunker.” Lilly is s aying that we won't die if we dig a big hole in the ground and hide under the gro und in a protected room. That's what an “underground bunker” (bunker) is. Li lly ends by saying, “Start digging!” “To dig” (dig) means to use usually a too l called a “shovel” that removes dirt and allows you to create a hole in the ground.  Lilly is telling Paul to start digging into the ground so they can create this und erground bunker. There are actually people in the United States who believe th at they have to have that kind of protection, and they make their own bunkers. I d on't know anyone personally who's done that, but I have read stories about it a nd heard about it on talk radio.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lilly: Quick, we need to go get some supplies. I wa s listening to talk radio on my way home from work, and this guy was on talking abo ut how doomsday is coming and we need to prepare.

Paul: Oh no, not this again. You have to stop liste ning to that garbage on the radio. Listen, there is no impending doom, and this  guy was just crying wolf.

Lilly: No, he wasn’t. He had proof that the world is going to end soon and he was sounding the alarm. Those people killed in the stor m last week? They were the canaries in the coal mine. Disaster is coming!

Paul: Let me be the voice of reason for a minute. H ow many times have you believed that the world was ending in the past few years?

Lilly: A few times, but this is for real. There’ll be a disruption of services, a run on food and water, and chaos!

Paul: Let me ask you this: if the world is ending, aren’t we all just going to die?

Lilly: Not if you have an underground bunker. Start  digging!

# Visiting Childcare Centers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 919 – Visiting Child Care Centers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 919 – or backwards: 919.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can find that 8- to 10-page guide on our website at ESLPod.com. You can download that guide if you become a member of ESL Podcast, which I hope yo u will.

This episode is a dialogue between Adam and Noelle about trying to find a place where they can put their young child while the two of them work. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adam: What’s that?

Noelle: It’s a list of questions I’m going to ask a t the childcare center when we visit today. I want to be prepared.

Adam: We already know that it’s licensed and has a good reputation. What other questions are you going to ask?

Noelle: Lots. For instance, I want to know what the  ratio is of children to each childcare worker and what their staff turnover rate  is.

Adam: Okay, I guess those are important questions.

Noelle: And I want to know what their policies are on disciplining the kids and what kinds of meals and snacks they serve.

Adam: Also good questions.

Noelle: And I want to find out their policies on si ck kids and if they allow late pick- up.

Adam: Yeah, I guess those are really good questions , too.

Noelle: And I want to know if I can observe any tim e I want to and if there is a secure check-in/check-out system.

 Adam: Those are all good questions, but I guess is houldn’t be surprised that you’ve done your homework.

Noelle: That’s why you married me, right? Because I ’m so practical?

Adam: If that’s why I married you, wouldn’t that ma ke me  the practical one?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Adam asking Noelle, “What' s that?” Noelle says, “It's a list of questions I'm going to ask at the childcare  center when we visit today.” A “childcare center” is a place – not a school, but a nother place – that takes care of young children, children who are too young to be in  school, usually under the age of five. So, a young baby or a one-year-old, or two -year-old, or three-year-old, or four-year-old – all of these would be the kind of c hildren you would find in a childcare center, typically.

Traditionally, women always stayed home and took ca re of the children while the man went out to work. Over the last 50 years, and i n many western nations in particular, there has been a change in the economy.  So, now a lot more women work. Some of these women, if they have a lot of mo ney, can hire someone, can get someone to come in and take care of their child ren at their home – what we might call a “nanny” (nanny). This is one woman who  comes – typically it is a woman – who comes and takes care of children while the wife is working or somewhere else. This only happens, however, if you have a lot of money.

Instead, what most people do is, if the mother or f ather cannot stay home to take care of the child, they put the child in what's cal led a “childcare center.” A childcare center is a place where, usually, there a re several adults and lots of young children. It's sort of like a school, but usu ally they're not there to teach your children. They're just there to take care of them while you are at work.

Noelle has a list of questions she wants to ask the  people who work at the childcare center. Obviously, she and Adam are looki ng for somewhere where they can take their young child. Adam says, “We alr eady know that it's licensed and has a good reputation.” Adam is referring to on e specific childcare center that apparently Adam and Noelle are interested in. He says that this is a “licensed” facility, or a “licensed” childcare cent er. “Licensed” means it has official permission from the government to be a childcare ce nter. In many places, you must get permission if you want to open up a place like this that will take care of children. Adam also says the childcare center “has a good reputation.” A

“reputation” is what other people think of you. So,  if it has a “good reputation,” many people think this is a good place.

Adam says, “What other questions are you going to a sk?” Noelle says, “Lots,” meaning I have a lot of questions. I have many ques tions. “For instance” – for example – “I want to know what the ratio is of chil dren to each childcare worker.” A “ratio” is the same as a proportion. It's how muc h you have of one thing compared to another thing. If you have a ratio of 1 0 children to 1 adult, that means you have 1 adult taking care of 10 children. The ratio is 10 to 1 – we would say, “10 to (to) 1.” Noelle wants to know the  ratio of children to childcare workers.

She also wants to know what the “staff turnover rat e is.” “Staff” (staff) refers to the employees – the people who work at any company,  including a childcare center. “Turnover” (turnover) – one word – refers to people quitting their jobs and getting new jobs. When a company has a high turnove r, it has a lot of people who come and go. People are always leaving and they ’re always bringing new people in. We might refer, then, to the “turnover r ate” – the percentage of people who are replaced every month or every year.

Adam says, “Okay, I guess those are important quest ions.” Noelle says, “And I want to know what their policies are on disciplinin g the kids and what kinds of meals and snacks they serve.” A “policy” (policy) is a set of rules or regulations – what you do in certain circumstances, certain situa tions. Noelle wants to know “what their policies are on disciplining the kids.”  “To discipline” (discipline) means to do something to someone who is making a mistake or who has done something wrong – usually you try to do something s o that the person doesn't do it again. That is “to discipline,” to provide some sort of negative consequence for someone's negative actions. You're trying to correc t what they are doing and make sure they don't do it again.

People have different ideas about how to discipline  children. Some people think you should yell at them. Some people think you shou ld lock them in a room by themselves. My neighbors apparently don't believe i n any discipline for their children. So, everyone has a different idea about h ow you should discipline your child.

Noelle wants to know, also, something about the foo d that they give the children. She wants to know the “kinds of meals and snacks th ey serve.” A “snack” (snack) is a small amount of food that you might eat in bet ween meals. So, you have breakfast in the morning, and then maybe at ten o'c lock in the morning you have a snack. You have an apple, or a doughnut, or an or ange, and then you have

your lunch, which is a meal. Then in the afternoon you might have another snack, another piece of food, and so forth.

Children are often given little snacks in between their meals, and that's what Noelle is referring to. She wants to know what kind  of snacks they serve. Notice the verb “to serve” means to give someone food. Ada m says that these are good questions. Noelle continues, however – she has even  more questions.

She says, “I want to find out their policies on sic k kids and if they allow late pickup.” “Sick kids” would be kids who are ill, kid s who have some medical problem. They might have a cold or the flu, for exa mple. Noelle wants to know what their policy is on sick kids. She wants to kno w, probably, whether you can bring a sick child to the childcare center. Some ch ildcare centers do not allow you to do that because, of course, then all of the other children will get sick.

Noelle also wants to know about “late pickup.” “Pic kup” is when the parent comes to get the child at the end of the day. A “late pic kup” would be the ability to get your child at a time later than normal. So, normall y if parents come at five o'clock, but you can't be there until seven o'clock, you wou ld have a “late pickup.” It would be later than everyone else. Adam says, “Yeah , I guess those are really good questions, too.” Noelle continues, “And I want  to know if I can observe any time I want to.” “To observe” means to watch what is happening. Noelle is probably referring here to the ability for the pare nt to just come in and to watch to see how the childcare workers are taking care of th eir children.

Noelle says she wants to know if there is “a secure  check-in/check-out system.” In order to make sure that the children are safe, m ost childcare centers will have some sort of system where they only allow people wh o they know are the parents – or who the parents have sent – to pick up their c hildren. “To check in” is the opposite of “to check out.” “To check in” is when y ou first arrive at a location. We talk about checking into a hotel. When you get ther e, you go to the desk and they give you a key, and you give them money and your na me. “To check out” is when you leave. So, “to check in your children” would be  to bring them to the childcare center, typically in the morning, and then check ou t would be to come at the end of the day and pick them up. “Secure” (secure) here  just means safe.

Adam says, “Those are all good questions, but I gue ss I shouldn't be surprised that you’ve done your homework.” “Homework” is usua lly what you get in school, what a teacher gives the students to do at home and  to bring back the next day. “To do your homework,” as a general expression, mea ns to do the work required, to do the research, to investigate sufficiently.

Noelle says, “That's why you married me, right? Bec ause I’m so practical?” Someone who is “practical” is someone who gets thin gs done, who's concerned about the results, who’s very productive. I am the opposite of that. I am very impractical (impractical).

Adam says, “If that's why I married you, wouldn't t hat make me  the practical one?” Adam is saying, “Well, if I was smart enough to marry you, then I’m the practical one, because I am getting things done by having you do them.” That's probably somewhat true in many marriages.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adam: What’s that?

Noelle: It’s a list of questions I’m going to ask a t the childcare center when we visit today. I want to be prepared.

Adam: We already know that it’s licensed and has a good reputation. What other questions are you going to ask?

Noelle: Lots. For instance, I want to know what the  ratio is of children to each childcare worker and what their staff turnover rate  is.

# Leasing Business Equipment

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 920 – Leasing Business Equipment.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 920. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there, become a membe r of ESL Podcast, and download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue about renting or paying to use, temporarily, equipment for your business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Olena: We need to keep pace with changing technolog y, but how are we going to raise capital to upgrade our equipment?

Joel: I’m not sure. Maybe we can find a supplier wh o will extend credit to us. We can pay in installments.

Olena: That’ll be hard to do. No one wants to exten d credit these days.

Joel: I know what my brother did when his company n eeded new equipment.

Olena: What?

Joel: He leased it instead of buying it.

Olena: Leasing equipment? I’ve never considered it.  I don’t want to end up paying more for the equipment over time than it’s w orth, and still not own the equipment at the end of the contract.

Joel: The flip side is that you won’t be saddled wi th outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load. My brother says that there are ot her advantages to leasing. You can have the maintenance included in your contract,  so you won’t have to worry about high repair bills.

Olena: I don’t know . . .

Joel: And my brother also told me that he was able to negotiate a purchase option. You can do the same if you really want to o wn the equipment.

Olena: Your brother really seems to know what he’s talking about. Why isn’t he working for me?

Joel: You have someone even better. You have an emp loyee who listens and steals the competitors’ good ideas.

[end of dialogue]

Olena begins by saying to Joel, “We need to keep pa ce with changing technology.” “To keep pace (pace) with” something m eans to do as well as this other thing is doing, or to move as quickly as, or we might use another phrasal verb: “to keep up with” something else. In this cas e, Olena is talking about keeping pace with changing technology. The idea her e is that as technology changes, so we too must change. We have to adapt to  this new technology.

Olena says, “How are we going to raise capital to u pgrade our equipment?” “To raise capital” (capital) means to get money to do s omething for a business. When you want to start a large new project, you might ne ed to raise capital. You might need to go to a bank or to investors and have them give you money so that you can do this new project. You can also raise capital  for other things that are not part of a business, but the idea is that it’s for a  large project.

Olena wants to raise capital to “upgrade” their equ ipment. “To upgrade” (upgrade) means to get a newer version of something . We can talk about upgrading our software on our computers. We get the  latest version, the newest version. And there’s always a newer version, right?  “Equipment” refers to machines that we use for a particular purpose. It’s  a very general term. It could refer to a computer. It might also refer, in sports  for example, to a ball or a hockey stick. That’s sporting equipment. Here, we’r e talking about business equipment – things you would use in your business. It might be a computer. It might be a fax machine. It might be some machine th at makes something.

Joel says, “I’m not sure” – I’m not sure how we’re going to raise capital. “Maybe we can find a supplier who will extend credit to us .” A “supplier” (supplier) is a company that sells to other companies – sells, typi cally, equipment to other companies. “To extend (extend) credit” means to all ow someone to get something they’re buying from you before they give you any money. If you’re buying a car from me, I might say, “Okay, here’s the car, and pay me back in the

next two months.” I’m extending credit to you. I’m saying, “You can use this and pay me later.” That’s what Joel wants to do to get this new business equipment.

He says, “We can pay in installments.” “To pay in i nstallments” is to pay a little bit over a long period of time. So, if you owe someone $10,000, you may pay them a thousand dollars a month for ten months. That would  be paying in installments. Of course, that would be without interest. You migh t have to pay more with interest.

Olena says, “That will be hard to do” – that will b e difficult. “No one wants to extend credit these days.” “These days” means nowad ays or currently, in this time period that we’re in now. Joel says, “I know w hat my brother did when his company needed new equipment.” Olena says, “What?” – what did your brother do? Joel says, “He leased it instead of buying it.”  “To lease” (lease) means to use something for a short period of time and pay someon e to use it for that period of time. When that period of time is over – it might b e a month, it might be a year, it might be five years – then you have to give whateve r you are leasing back. You have to give whatever you are using back to the per son who you got it from and who you were paying. “Lease” is very similar to ano ther word: “rent.” We can talk about “leasing” or “renting.” We often use the two words interchangeably, one for the other. When we’re talking about equipment, howe ver, especially in a business situation, we would probably use the word “lease.” “Rent” might be used for, for example, “renting a car” or “renting a house,” although you can also “lease” a house. It just depends on the situation. In this case though, “lease” is probably more common for business purposes.

Olena says, “Leasing equipment? I’ve never consider ed it” – I never thought about it. “I don’t want to end up paying more for the equipment over time than it’s worth.” “To end up” is a two-word phrasal verb that ’s very common in English. It means to have to do something at the end of a certa in period of time, or to be in a certain kind of situation at some point in the fu ture. For example, “I don’t want to end up having to pay a lot of money for a house.  So, I’m going to buy it right now before the prices go up.” In the dialogue, Olen a does not want to end up paying more for the equipment that she’s leasing th an she would if she bought the equipment. “To end up” here, then, means to be in a situation where in this case she had to pay more money for the equipment th an it’s worth, than you could buy it for.

She said she doesn’t want to do that “and still not  own the equipment at the end of the contract.” A “contract” is just a legal, usu ally written, agreement between two people or two companies. Remember, when you lea se something, you have to give it back to the person from whom you were le asing it, and Olena is worried

that they’ll be paying more for the piece of equipm ent that they’re leasing than it’s worth. They could just buy it rather than lease it.

But Joel says, “The flip side is that you won’t be saddled with outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load.” “The flip side”  is the other side of something, the other aspect of something. Literally, we talk a bout the flip side of a coin – a small piece of metal money. “To flip a coin” means to put it on your fingers and use your thumb, typically, to make it go around in circles. “The flip side of something” is the other side of something. Joel is saying that the other side of this situation – the situation of leasing – is that  you won’t be saddled with outdated equipment. “To be saddled (saddled) with s omething” means to have to do something that is difficult. We might also use the expression “to be burdened with something.”

Joel is saying that you won’t have this problem, an d the problem you won’t have is having outdated equipment. Something that is “ou tdated” is something that is very old, something that is no longer used. If you have an old RadioShack TRS80 computer, that is very outdated. That was my first computer back many, many years ago. Joel says, “You won’t be saddled wi th outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load.” “To off-load” means to ge t rid of something that you no longer want.

Joel says, “My brother says that there are other ad vantages” – other positive things – “to leasing. You can have the maintenance included in your contract, so you won’t have to worry about high repair bills.” “ Maintenance” refers to taking care of a piece of equipment so that it continues to work properly.

Olena says, “I don’t know.” Joel says, “And my brot her also told me that he was able to negotiate a purchase option.” A “purchase o ption” is when you lease something, but if you decide to buy it, the owner w ill use some of the money you pay to lease it as part of the purchase price – as part of what he’ll accept as payment for the item. So, if you “lease to own,” wh ich is the common expression in this situation, you are paying money now to use it, and then if you decide to buy it, to purchase it, you have that option. You h ave that choice in the future. Joel is telling Olena that she will have that choic e if she wants to, in the future. He says, “You can do the same” – the same thing – “ if you really want to own the equipment.”

Olena says, “Your brother really seems to know what  he’s talking about. Why isn’t he working for me?” Joel says, “You have some one even better. You have an employee who listens and steals the competitors’  good ideas.” Olena is sort of

joking here. She’s saying, “Well, why hasn’t your b rother worked for me, if he’s so smart.”

And Joel says, “Well, you have something better her e. You have someone” – meaning Joel – “who listens and ‘steals’” – or take s – “the competitiors’ good ideas.” Your “competitor” (competitor) is a busines s that sells the same kind of thing that you sell. A “competitor” can also be som eone with whom you are playing a game and you’re trying to defeat. You’re trying to win over the other person. You’re trying to win the game instead of th em. That’s also your competitor. What Joel is really saying, then, is th at Olena doesn’t have to have Joel’s brother working for her because Joel is goin g to take all of his brother’s good ideas and give them to Olena anyway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Olena: We need to keep pace with changing technolog y, but how are we going to raise capital to upgrade our equipment?

Joel: I’m not sure. Maybe we can find a supplier wh o will extend credit to us. We can pay in installments.

Olena: That’ll be hard to do. No one wants to exten d credit these days.

Joel: I know what my brother did when his company n eeded new equipment.

# Describing Chance and Probability

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 921 – Describing Chance and Probability.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 920. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can download it at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialogue that’s going to give us some of the vocabulary we use in talking about taking a chance or how likely some thing is – what we call “probability.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raul: What are the chances that Rob will be here on  time?

Tiffany: I’d say it’s fifty-fifty. You never know. He might surprise us and be early.

Raul: Fat chance of that happening. I’ve known him for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive early or n ot, I’d be in big trouble.

Tiffany: Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irr esponsible. I’d say there’s a pretty good probability that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised.

Raul: His intentions are good, but he loses track of time and doesn’t know what day it is half the time.

Tiffany: He told me that he’s trying to change.

Raul: Well, as I said, his intentions are good. He just needs to work on his follow- through.

Tiffany: Come on, he could be on his way right now.

Raul: Don’t hold your breath. I’ll believe his prom ises when hell freezes over.

Tiffany: Aren’t you being just a wee bit cynical?

 Raul: And aren’t you just indulging in wishful thin king?

Tiffany: Hey, I think that’s him coming down the ro ad! I think you’d better eat your words.

Raul: And I think you’d better get glasses.

[end of dialogue]

Raul says to Tiffany, “What are the chances that Ro b will be here on time?” “What are the chances” means “How likely is it?” What is the probability that Rob will be here on time? Normally, when we talk about the chances or the probability, people give a percentage – how likely something is to happen. For example, the people who try to forecast the weather , who try to say whether it’s going to rain tomorrow or not, usually give the cha nce of rain in a percentage. “There’s a 50 percent chance it will rain tomorrow, ” or “There’s an 80 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow.” Tiffany says – in talking about the chances of Rob being here on time, she says – “I’d say it’s 50 -50.” “50-50” means it could be that he shows up on time or not. There’s an equal p robability.

Tiffany says, “You never know. He might surprise us  and be early.” Raul doesn’t believe this, however. He says, “Fat chance of that  happening.” The expression “fat (fat) chance” is an informal one which means s omething is very unlikely, almost impossible. It’s a very informal expression.  It has nothing to do with someone being fat, someone being overweight. It jus t means that there is not a very good chance. In fact, it’s almost impossible. If my friend says to me, “I’m going to walk over to that woman and ask for her ph one number.” And I say to him, “Fat chance,” which means she is not going to give you her phone number, maybe her email address. I guess people give out em ail addresses now. I don’t know.

Anyway, Raul says, “I’ve known him” – I’ve known Ro b” – “for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive earl y or not, I’d be in big trouble.” The expression “to stake (stake) your life on somet hing” means to be completely sure of something, so sure that you would die if yo u were wrong. That’s how sure you are. You’re saying, “You can kill me if I’m not  correct,” in a way. “I’ll stake my life on something” means “I’m absolutely sure that this is true.” Raul, however, is saying that “If I had to stake my life on this fact  – that Rob will arrive early – I would be in big trouble. If that situation were tru e, I would be in a lot of trouble. I would be in big trouble. I would have a lot of prob lems.”

 Tiffany says, “Don’t exaggerate.” “To exaggerate” m eans to make something seem more important, or larger, or worse than it re ally is. Raul is saying that there is no chance that Rob will arrive early. Tiff any says, “Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irresponsible.” “To be irresponsib le” means to be not responsible, to not worry about the negative consequences of you r actions. That would be “irresponsible.” “Rob is not completely irresponsib le,” Tiffany says. “I’d say there’s a pretty good probability” – a pretty good chance – “that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised ,” or especially because he promised to be here on time.

Raul says, “His intentions are good.” Rob’s “intent ions” are the things that he plans on doing. Your “intentions” are your plans – what you want to do, what you are planning on doing. Raul says, “His intentions a re good.” He wants to do the right thing. “But he loses track of time and doesn’ t know what day it is half the time.” The expression “to lose track (track) of” so mething means to not be paying attention and then not to know where something is. Normally we use this expression with time, to mean to not know what time  it is, to be so involved in some activity that you don’t realize what the time is and often are late for things that you should not be late for. “To lose track of time,” then, means not to know what time it is because you’re so busy doing other things.

Raul says that’s what happens to Rob. “He loses tra ck of time and doesn’t know what day it is.” He doesn’t know if today is Monday  or Tuesday or Wednesday. He “doesn’t know what day it is half the time.” The  expression “half the time” doesn’t really refer specifically to what time it i s. It’s a general expression meaning “usually,” or at least 50 percent of the ti me. Half the time, I don’t know where my dog is. That means I usually don’t know wh ere he is. Fifty percent of the time, I don’t know where he is. Of course, it w ould be very difficult for me to lose track of my dog because I don’t own a dog, but  if I did own a dog, I probably wouldn’t know where he was half the time.

Tiffany says, “He told me that he’s trying to chang e.” Raul said, “Well, as I said,” – as I already mentioned – “his intentions are good . He just needs to work on” – to work harder on – “his follow-through.” “Follow-t hrough” (through) means doing what you promised to do. Tiffany says, “Come on. He  could be on his way right now.” The expression “come on” here is used to indi cate that Tiffany disagrees with Raul. Tiffany thinks Raul is being unreasonabl e or is exaggerating. Tiffany says, “Rob could be on his way right now.” “To be o n your way,” means you are moving in a certain direction. You are travelling i n a certain direction.

Raul doesn’t believe, however, that Rob is on his w ay. He says, “Don’t hold your breath.” This expression, “don’t hold your breath,”  means don’t wait for something to happen, because it probably won’t happ en. We use this expression, “don’t hold your breath,” when we are saying to som eone, “I don’t think you should expect that. I don’t think you should get yo ur hopes up. I don’t think you should be anticipating that happening, because it p robably won’t happen.” “To hold your breath,” of course, means not to breathe.  So, if you hold your breath for a long time, you will possibly die. So, “don’t hold  your breath” means don’t hold your breath until this happens, because it will be a very long time before it does, and then you’ll be dead.

Raul doesn’t believe Rob will be here on time. In f act, he says, “I’ll believe his promises when hell freezes over.” This is an old ex pression, “when hell freezes over,” that is used to show that you don’t believe this will ever happen. “Hell” is, according to some traditions, a place where you go after you die if you have been evil or bad during your life. “Hell” is very hot. S o, for hell to freeze over – for water to freeze in hell – would be basically impossible, because hell is supposed to be a very hot place full of fire and that sort of thin g.

There’s a related expression, “a snowball’s chance in hell.” A “snowball” is a round ball made of snow. “A snowball’s chance in he ll” would not be very good. In other words, because hell is so hot, the snowbal l will melt. It doesn’t have a chance. It won’t survive. That’s what it means. Bot h of these expressions are very informal. You wouldn’t use them in a formal bu siness situation.

Tiffany says, “Aren’t you being just a wee bit cyni cal?” A “wee (wee) bit (bit)” is an old expression that means a little bit, a tiny a mount. It’s often used sarcastically. It’s often used jokingly when someon e is actually doing something in a much larger amount or in a much larger way. Ti ffany is saying that Raul is being a “wee bit cynical.” What she really means is  he’s being very cynical. “To be cynical” (cynical) means not to believe somethin g, especially not to believe that other people are good or have good intentions.

Raul says, “And aren’t you just indulging in wishfu l thinking?” “To indulge (indulge) in wishful thinking” means to pretend tha t everything is good, that everything is happy, even when it is not. We do this sometimes so that we don’t get depressed – so that we don’t feel unhappy – but  it’s not realistic. It’s not what is actually happening in the world.

Tiffany says, “Hey, I think that’s him coming down the road!” Tiffany thinks she sees Rob walking down the street. Tiffany says, “I think you’d better eat your words.” “To eat your words” is a somewhat odd expre ssion. It means to be forced

to admit that you are wrong. This is often used whe n it’s an embarrassing situation for the person to admit that they’ve made  a mistake, that they’re wrong.

Raul, however, at the end of the dialogue still doe sn’t believe he’s wrong. He says, “I think you’d better get glasses,” meaning T iffany is not seeing what she thinks she sees. She needs glasses so that she can see better, and if she had glasses, she would see that it was not Rob who is w alking down the road.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Raul: What are the chances that Rob will be here on  time?

Tiffany: I’d say it’s fifty-fifty. You never know. He might surprise us and be early.

Raul: Fat chance of that happening. I’ve known him for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive early or n ot, I’d be in big trouble.

Tiffany: Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irr esponsible. I’d say there’s a pretty good probability that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised.

Raul: His intentions are good, but he loses track of time and doesn’t know what day it is half the time.

Tiffany: He told me that he’s trying to change.

Raul: Well, as I said, his intentions are good. He just needs to work on his follow- through.

Tiffany: Come on, he could be on his way right now.

Raul: Don’t hold your breath. I’ll believe his prom ises when hell freezes over.

Tiffany: Aren’t you being just a wee bit cynical?

Raul: And aren’t you just indulging in wishful thin king?

Tiffany: Hey, I think that’s him coming down the ro ad! I think you’d better eat your words.

 Raul: And I think you’d better get glasses.

This dialogue between Greg and Anne is about someon e who doesn’t believe their doctor – who at least wants to get someone el se’s opinion, an additional opinion, about a medical condition. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Greg: Where are you going?

Anne: I’m going to see another doctor to get a seco nd opinion. My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical condition, and I don’t want to take it at face value.

Greg: You’re second-guessing your doctor?

Anne: No, I just want to make sure he’s right. He’s  also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I  really have it, I want to be more aggressive.

Greg: Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?

Anne: No, he even gave me a recommendation for anot her specialist.

Greg: What’s all of that?

Anne: This is a complete set of my records along wi th my test results. I’m hoping he’ll have a fresh perspective when he looks at all  of it and my patient history.

Greg: What are you hoping he’ll find?

Anne: The best-case scenario is that he’ll find tha t my doctor was wrong and that I don’t really have this condition.

Greg: If he tells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious ? You’ll have one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’t.

Anne: Then it would be time for a third opinion.

[end of dialogue]

Greg begins our dialogue by asking Anne, “Where are  you going?” Anne says, “I’m going to see another doctor to get a second op inion.” The expression “second opinion” means you’ve gotten the recommenda tion or opinion of one person, but you want to get someone else’s opinion,  someone else’s recommendation. The expression is often used in tal king about healthcare – about medicine – when you talk to one doctor who sa ys you should do this, and then maybe you don’t like that idea, or you don’t t hink the doctor knows what he’s talking about, so you go to see another doctor and get his or her opinion.

Anne wants to go see another doctor to get a second  opinion. She says, “My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical conditio n, and I don’t want to take it at face value.” “To diagnose” (diagnose) means to i dentify a problem, especially a medical problem – why someone is sick or what ill ness a person has. “Medical condition” refers to a disease or an illness that y ou have, some problem in your body. The expression “to take something at face (fa ce) value” means to accept something as being true, but without investigating it very much – to believe that it’s true without getting more information, without  researching it.

“Face value” is a term that we often use in talking  about money. We talk about the face value of a coin, or the face value of a ce rtain bill, a certain piece of money. Sometimes, money that’s very old might be wo rth more than what it says on the piece of money. That would be where you have  something that is worth more than the face value of the coin, or the face v alue of the bill.

So, if you have a five cent coin from, I don’t know , 1893, it might be worth more than five cents even though the face value is still  five cents. When I was growing up, we used to collect pennies, and you try to coll ect pennies from different years but also from different mints. A “mint” (mint) here  means the places where they manufactured or made the coins, and that would be i ndicated on the coin itself.

Anyway, getting back to our dialogue, Anne doesn’t believe her idiot doctor and wants to get another opinion. Greg says, “You’re se cond-guessing your doctor?”

“To second guess” means to question someone’s opini on or to question someone’s actions. Anne says, “No. I just want to make sure he’s right.” I want to be certain he’s correct.

“He’s also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I really have it, I want to be more aggressive.” “Tre atment” refers to how you try get someone better, how you try to heal someone, ho w you try to get someone to recover from their sickness or illness. A “conserva tive treatment” would be a treatment where you do the minimum. You do a small amount but not as much as you could. The opposite of conservative here wou ld be “aggressive” (aggressive). “Aggressive treatment” would be to do  the maximum, to do as much as possible to try to get the person over thei r sickness or to get the person healthy.

Greg says, “Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re ge tting a second opinion?” Here, the verb “to mind” means to be bothered by. “ Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?” Anne says, “No. H e even gave me a recommendation for another specialist.” A “speciali st” (specialist) is a doctor in this case, who knows a lot about one particular ill ness, one particular kind of medical condition. You might have a specialist in e ars and throats and noses. In fact, there is something called an “ear, nose, thro at specialist.” In American hospitals, these are doctors who know a lot about t hose three things. So, if you have a problem with your ears – my wife thinks I ha ve a problem with my ears – you would go to an “ear, nose, and throat specialis t.”

Greg says, “What’s all of that?” He sees something else that Anne is holding in her hand. Anne says, “This is a complete set of my records along with my test results.” The word “records” (records) has a couple  of different meanings. Here, it refers to documents or pieces of paper or, nowadays , electronic files that have information about you. “Medical records” is a refer ence to documents about your health – how old you are, how much you weigh, resul ts from medical tests you might have taken in the past, and so forth.

Anne, in fact, talks about “test results.” “Test re sults” are outcomes of exams or analyses, especially when we are referring to thing s like a blood test. The doctor takes some of your blood, and then they analyze the  blood for certain things. That would be – once you get the results, once you get what the analysis says – your test results. Anne has all this information th at she’s going to give the other doctor, the other specialist.

She says, “I’m hoping he’ll” – the doctor – “have a  fresh perspective when he looks at all of it” – all of my records – “and my p atient history.” A “fresh

perspective” means a new opinion about something, e specially from someone who has not been involved in the case or involved i n the situation. If you work on something for a very long time, sometimes you can’t  see certain issues or certain problems because you’re too close to it. You’ve bee n involved with it for too long. You need to get a new or a fresh perspective – a ne w view on things, usually from someone else who hasn’t been working on the sa me thing you have.

Anne wants to get a fresh perspective on her medica l records and her patient history. Your “patient (patient) history” is a deta iled record of everything that the doctor has done for you – all of the tests he has p erformed on you, all of the drugs that he has given you, and so forth. That wou ld be your “patient history.”

Greg then asks, “What are you hoping he’ll find?” A nne says, “The best-case scenario is that he’ll find that my doctor was wron g and that I don’t really have this condition.” A “scenario” (scenario) is a situa tion or an outcome, a result. “Best-case (case)” refers to the best possible situ ation. So, a “best-case scenario” is the best possible thing that could hap pen. If you apply for a job, the best-case scenario is that they give you the job, a nd they give you a new house and a new car. Well, that probably won’t happen, bu t that would probably be the best-case scenario – the best possible thing that c ould happen. The opposite of a best-case scenario is a worst-case scenario – a “wo rst- (worst) case scenario.”

Anne hopes that the second specialist will tell her  that she doesn’t have this disease or this problem at all. Greg says, “If he t ells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious?” “To be dubious” (dubious) means to be dou btful – not to believe or not to trust someone or something. Greg says, “You’ll h ave one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’ t.” Anne says, quite logically, “Then it would be time for a third opinion.” It wou ld be time for her to see a third doctor, a third specialist, which I think is actual ly a good idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Greg: Where are you going?

Anne: I’m going to see another doctor to get a seco nd opinion. My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical condition, and I don’t want to take it at face value.

Greg: You’re second-guessing your doctor?

Anne: No, I just want to make sure he’s right. He’s  also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I  really have it, I want to be more aggressive.

Greg: Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?

Greg: If he tells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious ? You’ll have one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’t.

This episode is a dialogue between Alicia and James  about having problems getting someone to lend you money. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Alisha: This is the second time I’ve been turned do wn for a credit card in a month. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

James: Have you checked your credit report recently ? Maybe you have a bad credit rating.

Alisha: I have a full-time job with a good income, which they can easily verify, and I don’t have any outstanding debt, so what coul d be the problem?

James: Have you had a credit card before?

Alisha: Yes.

James: Did you always make your payments on time?

Alisha: Well, no.

James: Then that may be your answer. Your payment h istory makes a big difference with the credit bureau. If you’ve missed  payments or been late, that’s a big strike against you.

Alisha: You mean if I were late a few times, I woul dn’t be able to get another credit card?

James: A few times? How many times?

 Alisha: Well, maybe a lot of times.

James: And why do you need another credit card if y ou already have one?

Alisha: Had one, past tense. The credit card compan y cancelled it.

James: Aha, I think we’ve just found the crux of the problem.

[end of dialogue]

Alisha says, to begin our dialogue, “This is the se cond time I’ve been turned down for a credit card in a month.” A “credit card”  is like a Visa or a MasterCard that you use to buy things with. “To be turned down ” means to be denied, to be rejected. It’s a two-word phrasal verb meaning not to allow someone to have something or to do something. In this case, Alisha has tried to get a credit card, but the credit card company said no. They turned he r down. She says, “I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.”

James says, “Have you checked” – have you looked at  – “your credit report recently?” A “credit report” is a written statement , usually from one of three large companies that produce these statements, about whet her you have paid your credit card bills and your other loans from banks a nd other places on time. If you don’t pay your bills on time, if you send the money  in late, that will show up on – that is, that will appear on – your credit report. And if you do that a lot, companies are not going to give you a credit card if they see  that you have not paid your credit card bills in the past – your credit card bi lls from other banks and companies.

“Credit reports” are things that every American who  uses a credit card has. Most Americans do not have a very good credit report – a  very good “credit record,” we would say. They have problems. There are ways of  correcting the problems but it takes a little time. But let’s continue with  our dialogue.

James says, “Maybe you have a bad credit rating” (r ating). What these companies do, that produce the credit reports, is c alculate how well you do on paying your bills, and they give you a number. A hi gh number is good. A low number is bad. So, having a low, or bad, or negativ e credit rating is to have a number that indicates that you have had problems pa ying your bills on time in the past. Many credit card companies look at your credi t rating and decide if they’re going to give you a loan or not. Banks also look at  this information to decide whether they’re going to loan you money.

 Alisha says, “I have a full-time job with a good in come.” “Income” (income) is the money you get from working. Alisha says they can ve rify that information easily. “To verify” (verify) means to check to make sure it ’s true. We might also say here, “to confirm.” Alisha says, “I don’t have any outsta nding debt, so what could be the problem?” “Debt” (debt) is money that you owe o ther people, that you have borrowed from other people and that you have to pay  back to them. “Outstanding debt” is money that you have not yet paid back – mo ney that you still have to give back to the bank, or the credit card company, or whatever person or institution you borrowed money from.

James says, “Have you had a credit card before?” Al isha says, “Yes.” “Did you always make your payments on time?” Your “payments”  is the money that you give the credit card company for your bill. “On tim e” means before or on the day that you are supposed to pay it. So, if you need to  pay your bill by June 10th and you don’t pay it until June  15th, you are not paying on time. You are late, and  this will show up – this will appear – on your credit re port and result in a bad credit rating. Alisha says, “Well, no.” No. I didn’t alway s make my payments on time.

James says, “Then that may be your answer.” That’s the reason, possibly. “Your payment history makes a big difference with the cre dit bureau.” Your “payment history” is a report about how often you’ve been la te in paying your bills. The “credit bureau” (bureau) is a company that keeps tr ack of that, organizes this information that produces the credit report, and gi ves the credit ratings. There are actually three large companies in the United States  that do this. Most credit card companies use one of those three credit bureaus to decide whether they’re going to give you a credit card or not. Once again, banks  do the same thing. They use one of the credit bureaus, one of the credit compan ies, to see whether you are a good person to loan money to.

James continues, “If you’ve missed payments or been  late, that’s a big strike against you.” “To miss a payment” means not to do s omething you should have done, and in this case it would mean not paying you r bill when you should have done. Sometimes people pay their credit card bills,  but they pay them late. If you do this, James says, “that’s a big strike (strike) against you.” The expression “a strike against someone” means something that will make it more difficult to do something well, or something that makes other peopl e have a negative or bad opinion about you. Usually, though, it’s the first meaning, referring to things that will make it difficult for you to do something that  you want to do. If your parents don’t have any money and you’re not able to go to s chool, that’s a big strike against you. That’s a big problem in terms of you t rying to be successful.

Now, the word “strike” actually comes from the game  of baseball, when the pitcher of one team – the person who throws the bal l – throws the ball, and the person who is trying to hit the ball, the batter, s wings at the ball – moves the large stick, the bat, to try to hit the ball – but misses. That’s called a “strike.” There are other ways of getting a strike, too. If y ou hit the ball and it doesn’t stay within the lines that it’s supposed to stay in the field, that could also be considered a “strike.” I don’t want to go into the rules of baseball, but the term, you should know, comes from baseball.

Alisha says, “You mean if I were late a few times, I wouldn’t be able to get another credit card?” James says, “A few times?” – a small number of times. Then he asks, “How many times?” How many times has she been late? Alisha says, “Well, maybe a lot of times” – many times. Ja mes says, “And why do you need another credit card if you already have one?” Alisha says, “Had one, past tense.” Alisha is saying that she does not have a c redit card anymore. Remember, James asked why she needs another credit card if she already has one. He says, “if you already have one,” because “y ou” – we use the verb form “have.” However, Alisha is saying that it’s not som ething she still has. It’s something that she used to have, and that’s why she  uses the past tense “had” (had).

Alisha says, “I had one, past tense.” The term “pas t tense” is used in grammar to indicate that the verb is indicating time that has already passed, that an action has already taken place in the past and that it’s f inished, over and done. Alisha says, “The credit card company cancelled it” – canc elled her card. “To cancel” (cancel) means to end something, to no longer be us ing a certain service or paying for something.

James says, “Aha! I think we’ve just found the crux  of the problem.” “Aha” is an informal expression we use when you’ve found the so lution to a problem, and James has found the solution to Alisha’s problem. H e says, “I think we’ve just found the crux of the problem.” The “crux” (crux) is the most important part of a situation or a story, or in this case, a problem – the main thing, the main idea that’s important in understanding the problem. In A lisha’s case, she’s missed her payments and the credit card companies have cancell ed her card. This is why other credit card companies won’t give her another card.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alisha: This is the second time I’ve been turned do wn for a credit card in a month. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

James: Have you checked your credit report recently ? Maybe you have a bad credit rating.

Alisha: I have a full-time job with a good income, which they can easily verify, and I don’t have any outstanding debt, so what coul d be the problem?

# Getting Access to Important People

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 924 – Getting Access to Important People.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 924. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about trying to get in t ouch with – or make contact with or communicate with – important people. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Camile: That is a really good idea.

Nathan: Thanks, but there’s no way I can get past a ll of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to the president. He’s the on ly one who can green-light a project like this.

Camile: Can’t you present it to your boss first?

Nathan: If I bring the idea to my immediate supervi sor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.

Camile: What you need to do is to get the ear of on e of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.

Nathan: I’m not sure how I can do that. I don’t kno w any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle. We don’t exactly travel i n the same circles, you know.

Camile: How’s your jump shot?

Nathan: Why do you ask?

Camile: My cousin works at the same gym where the c ompany president goes to exercise. Sometimes he likes to play a game of pick up basketball, often one-on- one. If you got a call from my cousin when he’s the re, you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the righ t time.

 Nathan: You mean talk business on the courts?

Camile: Sure, isn’t that how real deals get made?

Nathan: You might have an idea there.

Camile: Yes, but one piece of advice: Let him win!

[end of dialogue]

Camile begins our dialogue by saying, “That is a re ally good idea.” Obviously, we are coming in in the middle of a conversation that has already started between Camile and Nathan. Nathan says, “Thanks. But there’ s no way I can get past all of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to  the president.” Camile and Nathan are obviously talking about trying to commun icate with the president of some company.

He says, “There’s no way” – it’s not possible for m e – “to get past all of the gatekeepers.” A “gatekeeper” (gatekeeper) is someon e who works for an important person, typically who controls access to that person, who decides who is going to get to see that person and who will not  get to see that person. We usually think of presidents of companies or, certai nly, presidents of countries who have people around them who work for them who contr ol access to that person, who decide who’s going to get to talk to the presid ent and who isn’t. That’s what a “gatekeeper” is. Nathan is worried he can’t get p ast the gatekeepers – that is, he can’t get around them to communicate directly wi th the president. He talks about getting “access to the president.” “To get ac cess” is to be allowed to talk to or communicate with someone.

Nathan says, “The president is the only one” – the only person – “who can green- light a project like this.” The verb “to green-ligh t” means to say yes to something. It’s a very common expression in business, to mean to approve an idea, to say yes to a project. Why “green-light?” Well, of cours e, in a traffic signal, the green light indicates that you can go, that you can move forward. A red light would mean that you should stop. A yellow light, at least  in the United States, means that you need to be careful because the light is go ing to be changing to red soon. For most people, this means you need to drive reall y fast.

Well, Nathan says, “The president is the only one w ho can green-light a project like this.” Camile says, “Can’t you present it to y our boss first?” That is, “Isn’t it possible for you to talk to your boss as the first step?” Nathan says, “If I bring the

idea” – and we don’t know what that idea is – “to m y immediate supervisor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.” Your “supervisor” is your boss – the person who tells you what to do at your job. Your “immediate supervi sor” is the boss who’s just one level above you. In most companies, you may hav e a boss, and then someone who is their boss, and then someone even hi gher who’s their boss. Your “immediate supervisor” is the boss who’s close st to you, if you will – the one who is just one level above you. The idea is that t hat boss, that supervisor, himself has a boss or a supervisor.

Nathan says if he brings the idea he has to his imm ediate supervisor, “she will either take it over or nix it.” “To take something over” means to fully control something, to say, “Okay. I’m going to now do every thing related to this project.” It’s sort of like stealing it, in a way, except tha t the person who’s taking it over may have the right to do that – may say, “Okay. Wel l, I’m going to say this is my idea, and I’m going to take it over. I’m going to a ct upon it myself.” Nathan says if he gives his idea to his immediate supervisor, “she ’ll either take it over or nix it.” “To nix” (nix) means to reject, to cancel, to say no to something.

Camile says, “What you need to do is to get the ear  of one of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.” “To get the ear of someone” means to get someone to listen to you, to get someone to pay  attention to you. An “advisor” (advisor) is a person who gives advice an d recommendations to a more important person – a president, or a vice-president , or a boss. Your “advisors” are the people that you ask recommendations from. You ask their opinion about something that’s important to you.

“To do an end (end) run” means to go around, or to bypass, or to skip someone who normally you would have to talk to and get the approval of and, instead, go to someone at a higher level. So, instead of talkin g to your immediate supervisor, you go directly to the president. You go all the wa y around that person. You do an end run. You go around the person. That’s what C amile is recommending to Nathan, that he needs to do an end run around the o ther managers in order to get the ear of one of the president’s advisors.

Nathan says, “I’m not sure how I can do that. I don ’t know any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle.” The phrase “inner (i nner) circle” refers to the closest advisors to an important person like a president. T he president’s or leader’s inner circle would be the small group of men and women th at he or she gets advice from – talks to in order to find out what should be  done next. That’s the inner circle.

Nathan says, “We don’t exactly travel in the same c ircles, you know.” The expression “to travel in the same circles” uses the  word “circle” again but in a different way. It means a group of people who are a t the same social level who are often friends with each other or who have somet hing in common. For example, here in Los Angeles there are some people who know a lot of movie writers, and movie directors, and movie producers. I do not travel in those same circles, meaning none of my friends or people I kno w are movie directors and producers. That’s actually not true. My old neighbo r is a movie producer.

But anyway, the expression “to travel in the same c ircles” means to have the same kinds of friends or to be in the same situatio n where you would know these people. That’s what Nathan is saying is not the cas e for him. He doesn’t travel in the same circles as the inner circle, the close adv isors of the president.

Camile says, “How’s your jump shot?” A “jump (jump)  shot” is something you do in the game of basketball, where you jump up in the  air and try to throw the ball into the round circle called the “basket.” It’s an odd question. So, Nathan says, “Why do you ask?” – “Why are you asking about how I  play basketball?” Camile says, “My cousin works at the same gym” – the same gymnasium – “where the company president goes to exercise. Sometimes, he l ikes to play a game of pickup basketball.” A “pickup” game of anything is when you just play with the people who are there. You don’t plan it. You don’t organize your team in advance. You just go to a place where you think oth er people will be, for example, playing basketball, and you make a team ri ght there. You form your own team. That would be a pickup game of basketball .

Camile says sometimes the president likes to play a  pickup game of basketball, “often one-on-one.” “One-on-one” is when, in basket ball, there are just two people playing – one person versus another person –  and you try to get as many points as you can by throwing the ball through the basketball net. Camile says, “If you got a call from my cousin when he’s there” – in  other words, if Camile’s cousin called Nathan when the president was at the gym – “you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the right time. The expression “the right place at the right time” means to be at a cer tain place at a certain time, where you are able to do what you really want to do . It’s almost like having good luck. “To be at the right place at the right time” means to be somewhere and, even though you didn’t plan it, something good happ ens to you.

Nathan says, “You mean talk business on the courts? ” “To talk business” means to discuss what is happening at your workplace. The  “courts” here refers to the basketball court – the place where you would play the game of basketball. Camile says, “Sure. Isn’t that how real deals get m ade?” A “deal” is an

agreement. Nathan says, “You might have an idea the re,” meaning “I think that is a good idea.” Camile says, “Yes, but one piece of a dvice.” A “piece of advice” is a recommendation. “Let him win!” – meaning let the president win, allow the president to win. Don’t try to beat him in the game  that you are playing of basketball.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Camile: That is a really good idea.

Nathan: Thanks, but there’s no way I can get past a ll of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to the president. He’s the on ly one who can green-light a project like this.

Camile: Can’t you present it to your boss first?

Nathan: If I bring the idea to my immediate supervi sor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.

Camile: What you need to do is to get the ear of on e of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.

Nathan: I’m not sure how I can do that. I don’t kno w any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle. We don’t exactly travel i n the same circles, you know.

Camile: How’s your jump shot?

Nathan: Why do you ask?

Camile: My cousin works at the same gym where the c ompany president goes to exercise. Sometimes he likes to play a game of pick up basketball, often one-on- one. If you got a call from my cousin when he’s the re, you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the righ t time.

Nathan: You mean talk business on the courts?

Camile: Sure, isn’t that how real deals get made?

Nathan: You might have an idea there.

 Camile: Yes, but one piece of advice: Let him win!

# Going Through Customs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 925 – Going Through Customs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 925. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about someone who is going through customs. When you go into another country, the government officials of that c ountry often want to look to see what you are bringing into the country. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Customs Officer: Your passports, please. What is yo ur final destination?

Özkan: Los Angeles.

Customs Officer: How long is your stay?

Özkan: We’ll be there for a week.

Customs Officer: What is the purpose of your trip?

Özkan: I’m going there on business, and my family is accompanying me on vacation.

Customs Officer: Who are you traveling with?

Özkan: This is my wife, Ayse, and these are my chil dren, Mustafa and Ömer.

Customs Officer: Are you bringing in any restricted  items? Any plants, fruits and vegetables, meats, or animals?

Özkan: No.

Customs Officer: Do you have anything to declare?

Özkan: We bought some duty-free items in the airpor t. Here’s the receipt.

 Customs Officer: That’s fine. Step over to the exam  station for baggage inspection. ...

We opened our bags for inspection, and luckily, the  inspector found nothing to confiscate and we got off scot-free. I’m really gla d they didn’t find that cat we’re smuggling in as a gift for my favorite podcaster!

[end of dialogue]

The topic of this episode is “going through customs ” (customs). “Customs” refers to the office, or the people who work for the offic e, of the government that check the things that you are bringing into a country. So , when you go from one country to another and you have a suitcase – you have lugga ge with clothing and other things in it – the customs official wants to make s ure that you’re not bringing anything into the country you’re not supposed to. M ost countries have two people or two offices that handle new arrivals to the coun try, either at an airport or somewhere else. That would be “immigration and cust oms.” “Immigration” checks to make sure that you have the legal right to come into the country, and “customs” checks to make sure you’re not bringing a nything that you shouldn’t bring into the country.

Our dialogue begins, then, with a customs officer. “Officer” here just means employee – person who works for the customs office.  The customs officer says, “Your passports, please.” Your “passport” is the of ficial government document from your government that allows you to travel to o ther countries. In the U.S. you typically have to show your passport to an immigrat ion official and then later to a customs official, because it’s your official identi fication.

Customs officers will often ask you what your final  destination is. So, if you fly to Boston, but you are only going to arrive in Boston and stay there for a few hours, and then you’re going to drive down to New York Cit y, you would say your final destination is New York City. That’s where you are going to go. That’s the place you’re really going to go. You’re just here in Bost on to rent a car and drive down to New York City. That’s what the customs officer is asking Özkan.

Özkan says, “Los Angeles.” That’s his final destina tion. The customs officer says, “How long is your stay?” Your “stay” is the period of time when you’re going to be in a certain place. “How long are you going to rema in in Los Angeles?” Özkan says, “We’ll be there for a week.” The customs offi cer says, “What is the purpose of your trip?” Why are you coming? Usually they wan t to know if you’re there for

business or if you’re there for pleasure – that is,  just for fun. Özkan says, “I’m going there on business.” So, his reason, his purpo se, is for something related to his job.

He says, “My family is accompanying me on vacation. ” To “accompany” someone is to go with someone else. The other perso n needs to go somewhere, and you decide to go with them, perhaps “to keep th em company,” we might say. That is, to be their friend, to have someone for th em to talk to. That would be an example of accompanying someone.

In this case, the family is accompanying Özkan on v acation. “On vacation” means they’re there for pleasure. They’re there jus t to have fun, to relax. The customs officer says, “Who are you travelling with? ” Özkan answers, “This is my wife, Ayse, and these are my children, Mustafa and Omer.” The customs officer says, “Are you bringing in any restricted items?” A n “item” (item) is just a thing – something. A “restricted item” is something that yo u are not supposed to bring into that country or that, if you bring it into tha t country, you need special permission, or you might even have to pay money, li ke a tax, to bring it into the country. That would be a “restricted item.”

The customs officer then lists, or gives examples o f, restricted items – plants, fruits and vegetables, meats, or animals. In some c ountries, they don’t allow you to bring in plants, for example, because they’re af raid that they may be plants that have diseases, or have bugs, or have things th at might hurt the plants in that country. Özkan says, “No.” No, I don’t have any of these restricted items.

The customs officer says then, “Do you have anythin g to declare?” “To declare” (declare) means to make an official statement. In t his case, it means to tell the customs officer that you have something that you wa nt to bring in the country but that you will probably have to pay tax on or that y ou think the customs officer might want to know that you’re bringing it in.

So, for example, if you’re bringing in a lot of cig arettes, or if you’re bringing in alcohol, you might have to declare that at customs.  You might have to say, “Yes, I am bringing in a bottle of alcohol,” and tell tha t to the customs officer. You might have to pay some sort of tax, however, if you do th at. But, you do not want to go through customs and not declare things you’re suppo sed to, because then, if they search you and they find those things in your luggage, in your suitcase, you could get into more trouble. They, in fact, could n ot allow you to come into the country, possibly.

Özkan says, “We bought some duty-free items in the airport. Here’s the receipt.” In many places, you can buy things without having to pay taxes on them, especially if you are about to leave the country an d you’re not going to remain in that country. If you are from another country, you can sometimes buy things at the airport, or even there on the airplane, that yo u don’t have to pay the local taxes on. That’s what Özkan is talking about. He sa ys, “We bought some duty- free items.” “Duty” (duty) is the tax. It’s another  word for a tax you pay to bring something into a country. “Duty-free” means that it  is not taxable. You don’t have to pay tax on it.

The customs officer says, “That’s fine. Step over to the exam station for baggage inspection.” “To step over” means to move over to o ne side, to go to a particular place in a particular direction, usually to the sid e of where you are right now. The customs officer wants the family to step over to the “exam station.” “Exam” is short for “examination.” The word “station” is some times used to describe one particular place within a larger place where someth ing is done. In this case, it is a place at the airport, usually a big table where the y take your luggage or your baggage and they open it up and they inspect it – t hat is, they look inside of it to see what you are bringing into the country.

When you come into the United States, you don’t alw ays have to go through baggage inspection. Sometimes it’s just random. The y just pick people who they think may be bringing something – or just because they need to show that they’re working – and they inspect the luggage. They look i nside of your luggage to make sure that you are not bringing in anything tha t you should not.

After the customs officer speaks to Özkan, he says,  “We opened our bags for inspection and luckily,” – fortunately – “the inspe ctor found nothing to confiscate and we got off scot-free.” The “inspector” is the p erson who works for the customs office who looks, who inspects the baggage.  “He found nothing to confiscate.” “To confiscate” (confiscate) means to take something from you because you are, in this case, bringing it in illeg ally. “To confiscate” means to take away something from another person. In this ca se, the inspector did not confiscate anything.

And so, Özkan says, “We got off scot-free.” “To get  off scot- (scot) free” means not to be punished for something you did wrong. We only use this expression if you’ve done something wrong but you are not punishe d for it. You have no negative consequences for it. That is “to get off s cot-free.” That’s what Özkan says.

He says, “We got off scot-free. I’m really glad the y didn’t find that cat we’re smuggling in as a gift for my favorite podcaster.” “To smuggle (smuggle) in something” or “to smuggle something in” is a phrasa l verb meaning to bring something in that you are not allowed to – to hide something so that the customs inspector doesn’t see it, because it’s illegal and you don’t want to get caught, or you don’t want to pay the duty, to pay the tax you would have to. This is not, by the way, a very good idea. But Özkan wants to give his favorite podcaster – I don’t know who that is – a cat. I assume it’s not m e.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Customs Officer: Your passports, please. What is yo ur final destination?

Özkan: Los Angeles.

Customs Officer: How long is your stay?

Özkan: We’ll be there for a week.

# Getting an Advantage in Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 926 – Getting an Advantage in Sports.

On this episode, we are going to talk about sports,  and in particular, how you can get an  advantage – how you can do better than othe r people in sports. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tammy: What are you doing this year to give your te am an advantage?

Phillip: I have a few tricks up my sleeve. We’re go ing to have a winning season.

Tammy: Are you going to start Wang?

Phillip: No, I’m redshirting Wang. I want him to si t out his first year so he can sharpen his skills.

Tammy: I’m really surprised. Wang is already a grea t player and too good to sit on the bench.

Phillip: Trust me, I know what I’m doing. He’ll get  an extra year of eligibility and be even better next year.

Tammy: If you say so. What about Schwartz?

Phillip: He’s out for the season. He’s hurt and won ’t be able to play.

Tammy: That’s a major blow! He’s your star player, right?

Phillip: He’s a loss, but I have a secret weapon.

Tammy: Oh, yeah?

 Phillip: This new player, Pierre, is going to give the other teams a run for their money.

Tammy: Who is he?

Phillip: Just somebody I recruited. Let’s just say he’s talented beyond his years.

Tammy: Huh? You mean he’s a ringer? You’re bringing  in a ringer?

Phillip: Of course not. He’s just a little more exp erienced than my other players, and he’ll be a force to be reckoned with.

Tammy: Only if nobody catches on.

Phillip: Catches on to what?

[end of dialogue]

Tammy begins our dialogue by asking Philip, “What a re you doing this year to give your team an advantage?” An “advantage” is a b enefit – something that helps you succeed or helps you do better at whateve r it is you're doing. Philip says, “I have a few tricks up my sleeve.” This is a n old expression, “to have a few tricks (tricks) up your sleeve (sleeve).” Your “sle eve” is the part of your shirt that goes over your arm. In magic, when you have someone  who's performing magic tricks, one of the things they do, I guess, is put things up their shirts and then they pull them out, and it seems like it’s magic.

Well, that's probably the origin, or where we get t his expression, “a few tricks up your sleeve.” Basically, it means to have a surpris e, to have a surprising plan that you're not telling other people about, that no one else knows about. “To have a few tricks up your sleeve” means to have a few thin gs that you're going to do that are going to help you, even though no one else know s about them.

Phillip says, “We’re going to have a winning season .” A “winning (winning) season” is a period of time when you are playing a particular sport and you are winning at that sport. “Season” is the time when yo u play a certain sport. So, in the United States, baseball season begins in April and ends in October. Actually, now I think it ends in early November, but that's the basic season – the time of year, the months that we play baseball, professiona l baseball. A “winning season” would be a season where your team wins most  of its games. That's a winning season.

 Tammy then asks, “Are you going to start Wang?” Wan g is the name of the player. “To start” means to put a certain player on  the field or on the court when the game begins. For example, when you have a hocke y game or a soccer game, the game begins and you have a certain group of players who are playing for you. Now, they may not play the whole game. You  may decide to replace one of them – to take a player out and put another play er in – but the players that you put on the field, or you “start” in the game at the  beginning, are called the “starters.” They’re called the “starters” because y ou start, or begin, with them.

Tammy is asking if Philip is going to start Wang, o ne of his players. Philip says, “No. I'm redshirting Wang.” “To redshirt someone” is sort of a particular phrase that we use in American sports. I'm not sure if it' s used in other English-speaking countries. “To redshirt” someone means to take a pl ayer, usually a young player, in grade school or high school, and not play them f or one year even though they could play. Now, why would you do that? Well, becau se in some sports, the rules say that a player can only play so many years. If y ou want a player to get better, to get more mature, you may wait a year and not pla y the player when they could play by their age, but you decide, because of their  experience, you're going to wait and not play them for another year.

So, now they have the same number of years – in ter ms of what they can play or when they can play – but they will be one year olde r and, therefore, will have more experience. There are even some parents who wi ll wait and not start their child in school when they're five years old. They’l l wait until they're six years old. So, the child will have a little bit more maturity and therefore advantages over the other children. My mother was just the opposite. Sh e had me go to school as soon as possible – the sooner the better.

Phillip says, “I want him” – I want Wang – “to sit out his first year.” “To sit out” means not to participate. He wants this to happen s o that Wang “can sharpen his skills.” “To sharpen (sharpen) your skills” means to become better at something, to become better at doing something, to become more  skilled.

Tammy says, “I'm really surprised. Wang is already a great player [and] too good to sit on the bench.” “To sit on the bench” (bench)  is a sports expression referring to the players who are not actively participating o r playing in the game. If you're sitting on the bench, you're not one of the starter s. In fact, you may not play during the game at all. Typically, this is done for  players who aren't very good. When I played basketball in seventh grade, I sat on  the bench almost the entire year because, of course, I'm not a very good basket ball player.

Philip says to Tammy, “Trust me” – believe me – “I know what I'm doing. He’ll get an extra year of eligibility and be even better nex t year.” “Eligibility” means that you meet the requirements to participate in somethi ng. The word comes from “eligible” (eligible), which means you're able to, you have the qualifications for something. Tammy says, “If you say so.” That's an e xpression we use when you don't really believe the other person, but you don' t want to argue about it. You'll just say, “No? Well, okay. I don't believe you, but  if that's what you say, then that's fine.”

Tammy says, “What about Schwartz?” (another player) . Philip says, “He's out for the season.” “To be out for the season” means that he is not able to play the rest of this season, perhaps because he's injured. And t hat, in fact, is exactly the case with Schwartz. “He's hurt and won't be able to play .” Tammy says, “That's a major blow.” A “blow” here means a problem. A “majo r blow” is a big problem. Tammy says, “He's your star player, right?” “He's y our best player,” is what Tammy is saying. Your “star (star) player” is your best player. Philip says, “He's a loss,” meaning, “Yes, we will miss him.”

“But,” Phillip says, “I have a secret weapon.” A “w eapon” (weapon) is something you use to hurt another person. A “secret weapon,” however, just refers to someone or something that you're going to use that nobody knows about, but is going to be very effective or is going to do a very  good job. Tammy says, “Oh, yeah?” Philip says, “This new player, Pierre, is go ing to give the other teams a run for their money.” The expression “a run (run) f or your money” means a challenging or difficult experience – something tha t is going to be difficult for you to deal with but that you have to deal with if you' re going to be successful. Tammy says, “Who is he?” Phillip says, “Just somebo dy I recruited.” “To recruit” (recruit) means to go out and find someone to bring  onto your team or to bring into your organization.

Philip says, “Let's just say he's talented beyond h is years.” “Let's just say” is a way of indicating that you're not telling the whole  truth, or you’re not telling exactly what you think or what you know, but you're  giving the person an indication by using indirect language. Phillip says  that Pierre is “talented,” or has a lot of skills, “beyond his years.” If you have so mething beyond your years, that means you're better than what we would expect for s omeone your age. If you're ten years old and you're able to do high-level phys ics and math, we might say that you’re “smart beyond your years.” You know mor e than what we would expect a ten-year-old to know. That has never happe ned to me, someone thinking I know more than I should at my age. In fa ct, it's usually the opposite.

Tammy says, “Huh?” She’s confused. She doesn't know  what Philip is really saying. She says, “You mean he's a ringer?” A “ring er” (ringer) – especially an athlete in a sporting game that comes in and is bet ter than everyone else but doesn't qualify – is not really eligible to play. S ometimes it is used just to describe someone who is way more qualified than everyone els e and doesn't really belong there. If you can imagine a professional golfer pla ying with a group of high school students as part of their team, that would be a cas e of someone who's an obvious ringer.

This does sort of happen sometimes, when you have y oung men and young women, or young boys and girls, who are great athle tes. They even go on and compete in the Olympics. Then they come back, and they go to college, and they're part of their college team. Well, of course  their college team is going to win, because they're one of the best athletes in the world at what they do. So, that might be a case of a ringer. I think technical ly, though, we use this word when someone really should not be there, when you a re breaking the rules to have them there.

Philip says, “Of course not” – of course he's not a  ringer. “He's just a little more experienced than my other players, and he'll be a f orce to be reckoned with.” A “force to be reckoned with” is someone who is very strong, someone who cannot be ignored, someone who is very powerful or who wil l be very good at what they do.

Tammy says, “Only if nobody catches on.” “To catch on” is a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to discover what's really happening, to find out what is really happening, especially in a case where someone is tr ying to keep something a secret. Philip says, “Catches on to what?” Philip a cts as though there's no problem, but Tammy thinks that there is a problem a nd that Philip knows there's a problem with this ringer – with this player, Pier re, that he's bringing onto the team.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tammy: What are you doing this year to give your te am an advantage?

Phillip: I have a few tricks up my sleeve. We’re go ing to have a winning season.

Tammy: Are you going to start Wang?

 Phillip: No, I’m redshirting Wang. I want him to si t out his first year so he can sharpen his skills.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 927 – Being Tidy and Messy.   This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 927. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.   Our website is ESLPod.com.

Let's get started.   [start of dialogue]  Carole: It is beyond me how you and Oscar can be roommates. You’re very tidy and he’s, well, a slob.   Felix: It’s not always easy, but we’re making it work.   Carole: Isn’t Oscar really messy all the time? Whenever I see him, his clothes are rumpled and his hair is unkempt.  Felix: His room is really cluttered, but he keeps the common areas in passable condition. I do have to straighten up fairly often, and I sometimes have to pick up after him, but that’s because I’m pretty nitpicky.  Carole: That’s very tolerant of you.  Felix: Well, we have set up a system so that if things get too messy, I have some recourse.  Carole: Really, what’s your system?  Felix: Oscar and I agreed that every time he leaves a big mess, I can fine him.  Carole: That seems kind of drastic, but maybe it works for you guys.  Felix: Yeah, it keeps the place pretty clean. # Understanding Corporate Structure

[start of dialogue]

Andrea: This organizational chart is really confusi ng.

Raffael: Why are you looking at that?

Andrea: I have an interview next week and I’m tryin g to bone up on the company I’ll be interviewing with. I want to impress them, but this chart is really confusing.

Raffael: Let me see. It’s a simple flow chart. You have your board of directors at the top, with the managing director reporting to th em, and then the executive officers overseeing major departments.

Andrea: But I thought managers work below the execu tive officers.

Raffael: You’re confusing managers with managing di rectors. The managing director oversees the entire company, and managers oversee daily operations.

Andrea: Oh, I see. So these here are the department s: accounting, marketing, purchasing, personnel, R & D, sales, and production .

Raffael: That’s right. Which department are you int erviewing for?

Andrea: I think the job is in purchasing.

Raffael: You think? Don’t you think that’s somethin g you should get straight before you do anything else?

Andrea: You might have a point there.

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Andrea saying to Raffael, “This organizational chart is really confusing.” An “organizational chart” is a d iagram or an image that shows you the structure or organization of a company. Her e's the president, and then below the president there are two vice presidents, and then each vice president has an assistant vice president, and so forth. An “ organizational chart” is like a map of the company – who is the boss and how are th ey arranged, from the president down to the lowest worker.

Raffael says, “Why are you looking at that?” Why are you looking at this organizational chart? Andrea says, “I have an inter view next week and I'm trying to bone up on the company I'll be interviewing with .” So, Andrea is going to interview, I guess, with a new company, and she wan ts to “bone (bone) up.” “To bone up” is an informal, two-word phrasal verb mean ing to study, to study a lot – usually to try to memorize a lot of information in a short amount of time. Andrea is trying to bone up on the company with which she'll be interviewing.

She says, “I want to impress them,” – I want them to think that I'm good – “but this chart is really confusing.” She can't figure o ut how the company is organized. Raffael says, “Let me see” – let me look at that. H e says, “It's a simple flow chart.” A “flow (flow) chart (chart)” is actually a  diagram that shows how a process works. For example, you could do a flow cha rt on how to make a cake or bake a cake. First, you buy the ingredients, then y ou mix them together, then you put them in the oven. Then you take it out of the o ven. That could be made into a flow chart so you could see on a piece of paper how  one thing causes another thing, or you do one thing and then another thing.

“Flow charts” usually have boxes and circles with a rrows that connect the different steps of a process. Raffael says that this organizational chart is a flow chart, which is probably not correct. Raffael isn't  the brightest person in the world – not the smartest person in the world, let’s say. I don’t think the organizational chart is a flow chart. A flow chart is a chart that  shows you how a process works, but an organizational chart shows you how things are arranged: one on top of the other, or one higher up than the other.

But, we continue with Raffael's explanation. He say s, “You have your board of directors at the top, with the managing director re porting to them, and then the executive officers overseeing major departments.” W e have a lot of vocabulary there. Let's go back and look at that sentence. “Yo u have” – meaning here you have on the chart – “board of directors,” or “the b oard of directors.” A “board of

directors” is a group of people who make the most i mportant decisions for a company. Often, people on the board of directors do n't work for the company full- time. They might even be from another company.

Large corporations and companies in the U.S. typica lly have a board of directors. In fact, the government requires corporations in mo st places to have a board of directors. Sometimes, the board of directors can ju st be one or two people. Typically, it's 10 to 15 people if it's a big compa ny. The board of directors is at the top of the organizational chart. They’re sort of li ke the leaders of the whole company. Below them, at least on this organizationa l chart, we have the “managing director.” The managing director can also  be called the “CEO” – the Chief Executive Officer. This is the highest-level administrator in the company – sort of like the president of the company, although  he may not be called the president of the company.

“Below the managing director” – below the CEO, mean ing “below” in terms of power and authority – “come the executive officers. ” “Executive officers” are high- level members of a company that are usually in char ge of a certain section or part of the company. These executive officers overs ee major departments. “To oversee” (oversee), as a verb, means to supervise –  to make sure that employees are doing their work. These executive off icers are in charge of, or oversee, major or important departments. A “departm ent” is a section or part of a company.

Andrea says, “But I thought managers work below the  executive officers.” Raffael says, “You're confusing managers with managing dire ctors. The managing director oversees the entire” – or the complete – “ company, and managers oversee daily operations.” So, the managing directo r is in charge of the entire company. The managers are only overseeing daily ope rations, usually in just one small part of the company.

Andrea says, “Oh, I see,” meaning “I understand.” “ So these here” – pointing at the organizational chart – “are the departments.” T hen Andrea lists the departments in this company, the sections or parts of this company. They are accounting, marketing, purchasing, personnel, R & D , sales, and production. We have lots of terminology here. Let's start with the  first department, which is accounting. The “accounting” department is in charg e of keeping track of the money – how much money comes into the company and h ow much the company spends.

The “marketing” department is in charge of getting people to buy the product or service that the company makes. That could be adver tising. That could be doing

other promotions. There could be a lot of things in volved in marketing. The “marketing department” is usually the most importan t part of the company, in some ways – often the part of the company that gets  the most money because, of course, if the company doesn't sell anything, th en the company won't survive.

“Purchasing” is another part of this company. “Purc hasing” comes from the verb “to purchase” (purchase), which means to buy. This is the part of the company that buys the things that the company needs to make  whatever product it makes. Another department is “personnel” (personnel). “Per sonnel” is the department that is in charge of hiring people, of getting new people to come into the company. “Personnel” also takes care of other thing s related to the employees and their stay at the company.

“R & D” is another department mentioned by Andrea. “R & D” is “research and development.” The “R” and “D” stand for “research” and “development.” This is the part of the company that creates new products o r new services. “Sales” is the part of the company that actually goes out and sell s the product or service to the customer. The difference between “marketing” and “s ales” is that the marketing people are trying to get people to buy the product in a general way by advertising. The “sales department” are the actual people who go and talk to the customer – who perhaps collect the money, who give the product to the customer, and so forth. “Production” is the final d epartment mentioned by Andrea. “Production” is the part of the company tha t actually produces or makes the product.

Raffael asks Andrea, “Which department are you inte rviewing for?” – which of these departments are you trying to get a job with?  Andrea says, “I think the job is in purchasing.” Raffael says, “You think?” meani ng “You're not sure?” He says, “Don't you think that's something you should get st raight before you do anything else?” “To get straight” means to clarify, to under stand something that might be confusing. Raffael is saying that, obviously, Andre a needs to know what job she's applying for before she goes to the company.

Andrea says, “You might have a point there” – she a grees with Raffael. She says, “You might have a point there.” “To have a po int” means to have said something important, to have said something that is  worth paying attention to.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andrea: This organizational chart is really confusi ng.

 Raffael: Why are you looking at that?

Andrea: I have an interview next week and I’m tryin g to bone up on the company I’ll be interviewing with. I want to impress them, but this chart is really confusing.

# Trying to Locate Someone

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 929 – Trying to Locate Someone.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 929. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can download it at ESLPod.com. In this episode, Carmen and Antonio are looking for someone. They're trying to find or locate someone. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Carmen: Hi, I’m looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time. Have you seen him?

Antonio: Waldo? I haven’t seen him in a while. He c omes in sometimes, but it’s pretty hit-and-miss.

Carmen: I can’t seem to pin him down. Every time I think I’m hot on his trail, I’m too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground .

Antonio: That’s Waldo. He’s the most elusive person  I know. I think he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to locate him.

Carmen: I’m starting to get that feeling. I’ve been  trying to track him down for over two months.

Antonio: He does seem to have a sixth sense and kno ws when to vanish.

Carmen: I’m starting to think he doesn’t really exi st and that he’s just a figment of my imagination.

Antonio: It’s funny you should say that. I think his ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.

[end of dialogue]

Carmen begins our dialogue by saying to Antonio, “H i, I'm looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time.” “To come in” somewhere means, really, to go to a certain place. “From time  to time” means sometimes but not always. We might also use the word “occasionall y.” Carmen says to Antonio, “Have you seen him?” meaning “Have you seen Waldo?”

Antonio says, “Waldo? I haven't seen him in a while ” – in a long time. “He comes in sometimes, but it's pretty hit-and-miss.” The ex pression or the phrase “hit-and- miss” means “unpredictable” – sometimes it's true, sometimes it isn't true. In this case, it means sometimes Waldo is there, wherever “ there” is, and sometimes he isn't. Antonio says that it's “pretty” – or “very” – hit-and-miss.”

Carmen says, “I can't seem to pin him down.” “To pi n (pin) someone down” means to, in this case, force them to make a decisi on about something, or perhaps to understand someone clearly. I'm not sure  which is the case here for Carmen – which meaning she's talking about. Normall y, “to pin someone down” is to get them to say yes or no to a question they perhaps don't want to make a decision about.

Carmen says, “Every time I think I'm hot on his tra il, I'm too late.” “To be hot on someone's trail” (trail) means to be very close to finding someone or finding something. Usually, we use this expression when the  person is being chased or pursued by, for example, the police. When the polic e are trying to catch a criminal, they may be hot on their trail. I'm not, again, sure what Carmen is talking about here.

She says, “Every time [I think] I'm hot on his trai l, I'm too late. He’s skipped town or has gone underground.” The expression “to skip ( skip) town” means to leave your town, to leave the place where you are living without telling anyone where you went. Usually, the expression is used when some one, for example, owes you a lot of money or has a lot of debt, and they need to escape because they don't have the money to pay you. In that case, we might u se this phrase “to skip town.” He skipped town because he didn't want to pay his f riend back the $5,000 that he borrowed.

“To go underground” means to hide yourself or whate ver activities you are participating in. It means to do something secretly . “To go underground,” if you’re a person, means to hide, to make sure no one finds you, probably because you've done something wrong. That seems to be the c ase with Waldo, here. Carmen says, “He’s skipped town or has gone undergr ound.”

Antonio says, “That's Waldo,” meaning that's what w e would expect from someone like Waldo. “He's the most elusive person I  know.” “To be elusive” (elusive) means to be difficult to find, or it coul d also mean something that is difficult to achieve, something that is difficult to accomplish. I want to be in the Olympics, but it's an elusive goal. It's a very dif ficult goal for me to attain, for me to achieve. Maybe someday, though, if they have a p odcasting Olympics. I definitely think I could win a gold medal. Well, a silver medal, anyway.

Antonio says Waldo is very elusive. He says, “I thi nk he actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse with people who are trying to  locate him.” Antonio is saying that Waldo likes or actually enjoys playing a game of cat and mouse. “To play a game of cat and mouse” is to be in a situati on where someone is trying to find you and you hide or you do things to avoid get ting caught.

If you think about what a cat and mouse would do if  they were in the same room, you kind of get the idea of what we're talking abou there. The mouse would try to run away from the cat, and the cat would try to cat ch the mouse. So, “playing a game of cat and mouse” means hiding from someone el se who's trying to catch you. That's what Waldo likes to do. He likes to do this with people who are trying to locate or find him.

Carmen says, “I'm starting to get that feeling.” Sh e means, “I am beginning to understand that that is the truth.” She says, “I've  been trying to track him down for over two months.” “To track (track) someone dow n” is a phrasal verb meaning to find someone, especially someone who is difficul t to locate. “My ex-girlfriend tried to track me down, but I changed my name so th at she wouldn't find me on the Internet. Don't tell anybody.”

Antonio says that Waldo “does seem to have a sixth sense and knows when to vanish.” “To have a sixth (sixth) sense” means to h ave a feeling about something – an intuition, we might call it, not necessarily a  reason. You think something is going to happen; you're not sure why. You can't get  an intellectual analysis of the situation, but you just seem to know – you seem to sense it. That's what a “sixth sense” is. Of course, we normally talk about the fi ve senses that a human being has: you can see, you can hear, you can taste, you can touch, and you can smell. Those are the five senses. The “sixth sense”  is this idea that somehow you have some additional power.

There was a movie, you may remember, with Bruce Wil lis called The Sixth Sense – a very scary movie, but a very good one. The famo us line or sentence from that movie was “I see dead people.” I see dead people. T here are no dead people in this dialogue, however.

 Antonio says that Waldo has a sixth sense and “know s when to vanish” (vanish). “To vanish” is to disappear. Carmen says, “I'm star ting to think he doesn't really exist and that he's just a figment of my imaginatio n.” Carmen is beginning to wonder whether Waldo is even a real person, whether  he really exists. She says maybe he's “just a figment (figment) of my imaginat ion.” To be a “figment of your imagination” means something that you’ve invented, something that you’ve created in your own mind but that is not real. Anto nio says, “It's funny you should say that.” “It's funny” here doesn't mean Antonio is laughing. He means it's interesting or it's curious.

He says, “I think (Waldo's) ultimate goal is to be invisible, just another face in the crowd.” Your “ultimate goal” is the most important objective, the most important thing that you want to accomplish. “To be invisible ” (invisible) means no one can see you. Antonio is saying that Waldo's ultimate go al is to be invisible, “just another face in the crowd.” A “face in the crowd” m eans that no one can distinguish you from anyone else. You're very ordin ary. You're very normal. No one would notice you. Antonio is saying that Waldo wants to be just another face in the crowd – someone that no one notices and, the refore, no one can find.

My own theory is that Antonio is Waldo. That's righ t, Antonio is Waldo, but he's hiding. He has something on his face so that Carmen  can't recognize him. Maybe Carmen is Antonio's – that is, Waldo's – ex-girlfri end. That would explain this dialogue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carmen: Hi, I’m looking for Waldo. I was told that he comes in here from time to time. Have you seen him?

Antonio: Waldo? I haven’t seen him in a while. He c omes in sometimes, but it’s pretty hit-and-miss.

# Fearing Bioterrorism

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 930 – Fearing Bioterrorism.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 930. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast today. This episode is a dialogue between Natalie a nd Anton about the unhappy topic of bioterrorism. It sounds like a lot of fun.  Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Natalie: Why are you wearing that gas mask?

Anton: I’m getting used to it. If we ever have a bi oterrorist attack, I’ll be ready. Want to try one on?

Natalie: No, thanks. If we get involved in biologic al warfare, I think we’ll have some warning.

Anton: That’s what you think. Airborne toxins, bact eria, or viruses could be in the air right now, and you and I wouldn’t be able to de tect it. It could infect you in the blink of an eye.

Natalie: Then I’ll be sick or dead anyway. So who c ares?

Anton: I said we  wouldn’t be able to detect it, but there are agenc ies with early detection equipment that could. As soon as they sou nd the alarm, we can put on our gas masks and take other precautions.

Natalie: If we’re really attacked by bioterrorists,  what good is early detection? It’s not like you can really escape the toxins.

Anton: Don’t pooh-pooh these preparations. They cou ld be the difference between life and death when the time comes.

Natalie: Right. In the meantime, I think I’ll just get dressed – without the stylish gas mask.

[end of dialogue]

Today we talk about a popular topic in the history of the world: war. We begin our dialogue with Natalie saying, or asking Anton, “Why  are you wearing that gas mask?” A “mask” (mask) is something, usually, that goes over your face. A “gas mask” is a special kind of mask that is supposed to  help protect you from dangerous air that you might breathe. Anton says, “ I'm getting used to it.” I'm getting used to the gas mask.

He says, “If we ever have a bioterrorist attack, I' ll be ready.” “Bioterrorist” (bioterrorist) is an adjective referring to someone  using biological weapons – that is, weapons that are made to usually make other peo ple sick, physically sick. The term “bioterrorism” refers to political groups or m ilitary groups that use these weapons in order to frighten other people in order to get them to change their political policy.

Of course, terrorism is something that we live with  in the modern world. “Terrorism” is basically an attempt by a group of p eople to change the policies or politics of another group of people, or another cou ntry, by using violence. Anton is worried about a “bioterrorist attack.” An “attac k” is when you try to hurt or kill another person. A “bioterrorist attack” would be an  attack that involved biological weapons.

Anton asked Natalie if she wants to “try one on” – that is, if she wants to try the gas mask on, if she wants to put it on her face. Na talie says, “No, thanks. If we get involved in biological warfare, I think we'll h ave some warning.” “Warfare” (warfare) just refers to actions in a war. Natalie is saying that if we are involved in biological warfare, we’ll have some warning. “Warni ng” (warning) is advance notification that something is going to happen. Whe n someone tells you in advance about something bad that is going to happen  in the near future – that's the definition of a “warning.”

Anton says, “That's what you think.” That expressio n, “that's what you think,” is used to show when you don't agree with what the oth er person has just said. For example, someone says to you, “If you don't study, you will fail your examination” – you will not pass your test. And you say, “Well, that's what you think. I never study for exams, and I always pass them.” That neve r happened to me, but you could imagine someone saying that. “That's what you  think” is used when you disagree with what the person just said. Anton disa grees with Natalie. He does not think they will get any warning if they are inv olved in a biological war.

Anton then gives some examples of biological weapon s, things that terrorists or others could use on people in order to make them si ck or kill them. He says, “Airborne toxins, bacteria, or viruses could be in the air right now, and you and I wouldn't be able to detect it.” Let's start with “a irborne toxins.” A “toxin” (toxin) is something that is poisonous, something that will hu rt living creatures – living beings like human beings. “Airborne” (airborne) mea ns something travels through the air. “Airborne toxins” would be toxins that tra vel through the air and that, of course, you could breathe in accidentally.

“Bacteria” is the plural of “bacterium,” which is a  single-celled organism – a very small living thing that can make you sick. A “virus ” (virus) is also very small thing that can reproduce itself. It can get bigger inside  of another living thing such as a plant or an animal. A virus can also make you sick.  Anton says, “Airborne toxins, bacteria, or viruses could be in the air right now,  and you and I wouldn't be able to detect it.” “To detect” (detect) means to notice , to identify, to find something.

Anton says that these things “could infect you in the blink of an eye.” “To infect” (infect) means to make someone sick, usually by giv ing them some sort of bacteria or virus. Anton says that these terrible b iological weapons “could infect you in the blink of an eye.” That expression, “in the blink (blink) of an eye,” means very quickly, very rapidly. To blink your eye  is to move your eyelids up and down across your eyes. That, of course, is some thing that happens very quickly. That's why we have this expression, “in the blink of an eye.” It means something happens very quickly, very rapidly.

Natalie, however, is not worried by what Anton says . She says that if something infects me, I'll be dead or sick anyway, “So who ca res.” In other words, there's nothing you can do about it. Anton said, “I said we  wouldn't be able to detect it, but there are agencies with early detection equipme nt that could.” What Anton is saying is that even though you and I cannot detect these poisonous toxins in the air, there are groups – government agencies, govern ment organizations – that have special equipment that could detect these pois onous bioterrorist weapons.

Anton says, “As soon as they” – these agencies – “s ound the alarm, we can put on our gas masks and take other precautions.” “To s ound the alarm” means to let other people know about some problem or some danger . To let other people know about some dangerous situation – that's the me aning of “to sound the alarm.” Anton says when the agencies “sound the ala rm” – when they let people know – “we can put on our gas masks and take other precautions.” A “precaution” (precaution) is an action that you tak e to try to prevent something bad from happening to you, to try to protect yourse lf.

Natalie says, “If we’re really attacked by bioterro rists” – people who use biological weapons – “what good is early detection? ” Natalie is saying here it won't matter if someone is able to detect or figure  out that we are being attacked. She says, “It's not like you can really escape the toxins.” Natalie is saying that we can't get away from these biological weapons. We ca n't escape the toxins. “To escape” means, usually, to run away from something.  Here, it means not to be affected by something.

Anton says, “Don’t pooh-pooh these preparations.” T hat expression, “pooh- pooh,” is a weird expression. “To pooh-pooh” someth ing means to indicate that something is not important or even that it's a litt le silly. We also have another verb, “to belittle” (belittle). “To belittle” an id ea is to pooh-pooh something, to pooh-pooh an idea. Anton is saying, “Don't pooh-poo h these preparations.” You should take them seriously, is what Anton is saying . “They could be the difference between life and death.”

When we say something is “the difference between li fe and death,” or “it's a matter of life and death,” we mean that it's so imp ortant that you could actually die if you don't pay attention to it or if things d on't turn out the way you'd like. Anton is saying that being able to have early detec tion could save our lives, and therefore, it would be the difference between life and death. I should mention here, also, that we say “life and death,” but the o riginal expression back in the early 19th century was “life or death.” However, in  the last hundred years or so, people use both “a matter of life or death” and “a matter of life and death.” You can use either one.

Natalie says, “Right.” She says this, however, in a  way that indicates she doesn't really believe Anton. She says, “Right. In the mean time, I think I'll just get dressed without the stylish gas mask.” “In the mean time” means until this happens, until there is a biological attack. “I thi nk I'll just get dressed without the stylish gas mask” – “stylish” (stylish) means fashi onable. It is used to describe clothing or things you wear that make you look good , that everybody else thinks looks good. Natalie is making a joke here. Gas mask s, of course, would never be considered stylish. They wouldn't be considered thi ngs that would make you look better. That, of course, is not their function.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Natalie: Why are you wearing that gas mask?

Anton: I’m getting used to it. If we ever have a bi oterrorist attack, I’ll be ready. Want to try one on?

Natalie: No, thanks. If we get involved in biologic al warfare, I think we’ll have some warning.

Anton: That’s what you think. Airborne toxins, bact eria, or viruses could be in the air right now, and you and I wouldn’t be able to de tect it. It could infect you in the blink of an eye.

Natalie: Then I’ll be sick or dead anyway. So who c ares?

Anton: I said we  wouldn’t be able to detect it, but there are agenc ies with early detection equipment that could. As soon as they sou nd the alarm, we can put on our gas masks and take other precautions.

Natalie: If we’re really attacked by bioterrorists,  what good is early detection? It’s not like you can really escape the toxins.

Anton: Don’t pooh-pooh these preparations. They cou ld be the difference between life and death when the time comes.

Natalie: Right. In the meantime, I think I’ll just get dressed – without the stylish gas mask.

This episode is a dialogue between Jane and Hercule  about solving a mystery – when someone has committed a crime, perhaps even mu rder. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jane: You have to watch this movie. It’s so good!

Hercule: I’m not really into mysteries.

Jane: But this is a really good whodunit.

Hercule: I prefer action movies.

Jane: Listen, the movie gives you plenty of clues, and the detective follows hunch after hunch, lead after lead, but the movie is full  of red herrings. Everybody seems to have an alibi and the witnesses aren’t rel iable.

Hercule: I don’t know. It seems kind of confusing to me. I don’t really want to use my brain when I’m watching a movie.

Jane: But that’s the fun part of it. The true ident ity of the victim is a mystery, the suspects all have skeletons in their closets, and the detective isn’t what he seems.

Hercule: Yeah, well . . .

Jane: And just when you think you’re getting to the  bottom of it, the rug gets pulled out from under you. It keeps you guessing un til the very end. Hey, where are you going?

Hercule: I’m going to find an action movie where al l my brain has to do is handle the sensory overload!

[end of dialogue]

Jane begins our dialogue by saying to Hercule, “You  have to watch this movie. It's so good!” Jane is watching a movie she really likes and wants Hercule to watch it with her. Hercule says, “I'm really not in to mysteries.” When we say we're “into” something or we’re “not into” somethin g, that means were interested in it or we’re not interested in it. Hercule says h e's not interested in mysteries. A “mystery” is usually a story about some crime. Typi cally, someone is murdered – someone is killed. That's a mystery.

Jane says, “But this is a really good whodunit.” A “whodunit” (whodunit), one word, is a story – it could be a movie, or a televi sion show, or a novel – about a murder that keeps people guessing. The story has a lot of different things going on, a lot of different people who could have done it – who could have committed the murder. “Whodunit,” although it's used as a sin gle word as a noun, obviously comes from the three words “who,” “done,” and “it.”  You're trying to figure out in the story who is the murderer.

Hercule says, “I prefer action movies.” Jane says, “Listen,” meaning pay attention to me, “the movie gives you plenty of clues, and the detective follows hunch after hunch, lead after lead.” A “clue” (clue) is some pi ece of information that gives you an idea about what happened. In this case, it gives  you an idea about who the murderer is – who is the person who committed the c rime. Jane says this movie “gives you plenty of clues,” meaning the movie indi cates to you different pieces of information that, if you put them all together, wil l help you figure out who the murderer is.

Most mystery stories have someone in the story who solves the crime – that is, who figures out who committed the crime – in this c ase, the murder. That person is called the “detective.” The “detective” is the p erson – it could be a police officer or anyone – who figures out who committed the crime . The detective is usually the hero of the story. For example, Agatha Christie , one of the great mystery writers of the 20th century, had two very famous de tectives about which she wrote several stories: Hercule Poirot and Jane Marp le – “Miss Marple,” as she was called in the books. Interestingly enough, our dialogue is between a Jane and a Hercule, but no relation to the Agatha Christ ie characters.

Jane says the detective in this movie “follows hunc h after lunch, lead after lead.” A “hunch” (hunch) is a guess. It's a guess about, i n this case, who committed the

crime. A “lead” (lead) is the same as a clue. It's information that will help you figure out who committed the murder. The detective,  then, “follows hunch after hunch,” meaning the detective makes some guesses in  order to try to figure out who committed the crime. Jane says the movie is “fu ll of red herrings.” A “red herring” (herring) is a distraction, something that  isn't important but that distracts you from focusing on what is important. A “red herr ing” is any piece of information or any event in the novel that looks im portant, but it turns out it really isn't important.

Jane says, “Everybody seems to have an alibi and the witnesses aren't reliable.” An “alibi” (alibi) means an excuse for where you we re or an explanation for where you were during the time of the murder. If the murd er took place at 10:00 a.m., and you were at the grocery store at 10:00 a.m., th at's your alibi – that's the explanation of where you were when the crime took p lace. “Witnesses” are people who see what happens or hear what happens. I n this case, in this movie, everybody has an alibi and “the witnesses aren't re liable,” meaning you can't believe what they say.

Hercule, however, still doesn't really want to watc h the movie. He says, “I don’t know. It seems kind of confusing to me. I don't rea lly want to use my brain when I'm watching a movie.” Hercule is saying he doesn't  want to think when he's watching a movie. He just wants to be entertained. That's why he likes action movies – movies with lots of car chases and violenc e.

Jane says, “But that's the fun part of it” – that's  why it's interesting to watch a mystery movie. “The true identity of the victim is a mystery.” The “victim” (victim) is the person against whom the crime was committed – in this case, the person who was perhaps murdered. The “identity” is the nam e of the person, who the person really is. In this story, in this movie, the  true identity of the victim is also a mystery. In other words, we don't actually know the  name of the person who was killed.

In addition, Jane says, “The suspects all have skel etons in their closets, and the detective isn't what he seems.” So, this is a very complicated mystery, indeed. In addition to not knowing who was actually murdered, or the name of the person who was actually murdered, these suspects all have skeletons in their closets. A “suspect” (suspect) is a person who might have comm itted the crime, who the detective thinks might be guilty, who might be the one who did it. Jane says, “The suspects all have skeletons in their closets.” The expression “to have skeletons (skeletons) in your closet” means to have secrets a bout yourself, secrets about your past that could be very embarrassing.

Skeletons in your closet are things that you don't want anyone to know about, things that you have done wrong in your past. The w ord “skeleton” refers to the bones in the human body. A “skeleton” is what is le ft after someone dies. The body eventually decomposes. It eventually is change d so that all there is left are the bones. The idea here is that if you kill someon e and you hide them in your closet, someone may go into your closet and eventua lly discover their bones. Once again, it's just an expression used to say tha t you have some bad things that you have done in your past. Jane says the dete ctive also “isn't what he seems,” meaning the detective may himself have some  secrets. Hercule says, “Yeah, well . . .”

And Jane continues trying to get Hercule to watch t his movie. She says, “And just when you think you're getting to the bottom of it” – just when you think you're understanding what happened – “the rug gets pulled out from under you.” The expression “the rug gets pulled out from under you”  means that there is a sudden change in the story, or something happens that is c ompletely unexpected that you didn't realize was going to happen. Jane says, “It keeps you guessing until the very end.” When we say something “keeps you gue ssing,” we mean you don't know. You don't know the answer. In this case, you don't know the answer until the end of the movie.

Jane then says, “Hey, where are you going?” Hercule  says, “I'm going to find an action movie where all my brain has to do is handle  the sensory overload.” “Sensory” (sensory) refers to your senses: what you  can see, what you can hear, what you can taste, what you can smell, and what yo u can touch. “Overload” (overload) is when you have too much of something. So, “sensory overload” is when you have too much noise or too much sound – to o much of whatever it is – that it's causing you some confusion because you ju st are getting too much information, if you will. That's what happens in an  action movie sometimes. There's so much going on that it's sensory overload .

Hercule is saying, here, he doesn't want to think. He doesn't want his brain to have to think, as it would if he were to watch the mystery movie that Jane is watching.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jane: You have to watch this movie. It’s so good!

Hercule: I’m not really into mysteries.

 Jane: But this is a really good whodunit.

Hercule: I prefer action movies.

Jane: Listen, the movie gives you plenty of clues, and the detective follows hunch after hunch, lead after lead, but the movie is full  of red herrings. Everybody seems to have an alibi and the witnesses aren’t rel iable.

Hercule: I don’t know. It seems kind of confusing to me. I don’t really want to use my brain when I’m watching a movie.

Jane: But that’s the fun part of it. The true ident ity of the victim is a mystery, the suspects all have skeletons in their closets, and the detective isn’t what he seems.

Hercule: Yeah, well . . .

Jane: And just when you think you’re getting to the  bottom of it, the rug gets pulled out from under you. It keeps you guessing un til the very end. Hey, where are you going?

Hercule: I’m going to find an action movie where al l my brain has to do is handle the sensory overload!

# Rebuilding Consumer Trust

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 932 – Rebuilding Consumer Trust.

This episode is a dialogue between Karen and Brando n about getting people who buy from your company to trust you again. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Karen: The scandal over our new product line really  damaged our image, and we need to rebuild consumer trust.

Brandon: This is going to be an uphill battle. Losi ng customers is easy. Winning them back will be really hard.

Karen: I agree, but our stock is taking a beating a nd we need to do something now.

Brandon: Part of the problem was that the rumors ab out the new product heightened expectations and we just fell short of the mark. We need to always remember to under promise and over deliver.

Karen: Yes, that was a big part of the problem, but  we also need to have more transparency. We can’t make major changes without f irst getting customer input and without notifying them well in advance. Otherwi se, our customers feel betrayed.

Brandon: All right, I think we have a place to begi n. Should I call a general meeting to talk specifics?

Karen: Sure, and while we’re at it, we can work on employee morale, too!

[end of dialogue]

 Our dialogue begins with Karen saying to Brandon, “ The scandal over our new product line really damaged our image, and we need to rebuild consumer trust.” A “scandal” (scandal) is some activity or behavior that causes people to be surprised or shocked. It's almost always considered  a bad thing. “To have a scandal” would be to have some sort of negative sit uation where someone has done something wrong or an organization has done so mething wrong. That's a scandal.

There was an old expression: “to give scandal.” “To  give scandal” is to do something wrong and have other people find out abou t it and thereby encourage them to do something wrong: “Well, maybe it's okay to misbehave,” and then they do. That's the idea of giving scandal. Nobody worries about that anymore, apparently, especially here in Hollywood.

Karen is talking about a scandal at their company, the company where Karen and Brandon work. The scandal relates to their new product line. A “product” is something you sell, usually something physical. The  other kind of thing a company would sell would be a “service” – they woul d do something for you. This is a “product line,” meaning it's a whole group of related products.

We're not sure what this scandal is, but Karen says  there was a scandal, and the scandal has “damaged” or hurt the company’s “image. ” Your “image” in this case means your reputation: how other people view you or  how other people see you – what other people think about you.

“We need to rebuild consumer trust,” Karen says. “T o rebuild” means to build again, to recreate, especially after something has been damaged or hurt. If you have an earthquake, like we have here in Los Angele s sometimes, and your house falls down, you will need to rebuild it – you  will need to put it up again. Or, you could move in instead with your mother-in-law, who lives in another city. Then you wouldn't have to rebuild your house, but y ou would have to live with your mother-in-law. Your “mother-in-law,” of course , would be the mother of your husband or wife. But here, we're not talking about rebuilding a house. We’re talking about rebuilding consumer trust.

“Consumers” are the people who buy your product or service – your “customers.” “Trust” is the good feelings and positive beliefs t hat people have about your company and your products. “To rebuild consumer tru st” would be to get people to trust you again, to like your company again, to want to buy your products again.

Brandon says, “This is going to be an uphill battle .” “Uphill” (uphill) means to go from the bottom of a hill to the top. “Uphill” is the direction that you are going. The opposite of “uphill” would be “downhill.” That woul d mean going from the top of the hill to the bottom. We do that, for example, wh en we ski. We call it “downhill skiing” – to ski from the top of the mountain or the hill to the bottom. Here, we’re talking about “uphill,” which is the opposite of “d ownhill.” A “battle” (battle) is a fight. So, an “uphill battle” would be a very diffi cult task, something that would be very difficult to do. Not only do you have to go up  the hill, but you also have to fight to get up the hill.

Brandon says, “Losing customers is easy. Winning th em back will be really hard.” It's easy to lose a customer; you can just make the m mad and they'll go away. To get them to come back again is, however, much more difficult. That is what Brandon is saying here. “To win someone back” means  to get them to come back – in this case, to your company to buy your product s.

Karen says, “I agree” – it will be difficult – “but  our stock is taking a beating and we need to do something now.” The expression “to ta ke (take) a beating (beating)” means to be defeated, or to be damaged o r hurt or injured. “To take a beating” would be to have a very negative experienc e in which you basically are losing whatever battle or whatever situation you are in. The “stock” of the company “is taking a beating,” according to Karen. The “stock” is the partial ownership that people have in your company.

Brandon says, “Part of the problem was that the rum ors about the new product heightened expectations and we just fell short of the mark.” Brandon is talking about “rumors.” These are comments that people make , in this case about a product, either good or bad. A “rumor” can be any s ort of information that has not yet been confirmed, that is not yet official, but t hat people are talking about. “Rumors” can be either good or bad. It depends on the situation.

Here, the rumors were about the new product, and th ey “heightened expectations.” “To heighten expectations” is to mak e someone believe that something will be really good, will be fantastic, w ill be better than they could've expected. That's “to heighten expectations.” “To fa ll short of the mark” (mark) is not to meet those expectations, not to do as well a s people thought you were going to do.

If you tell someone, “This is the best movie in the  world. You're going to love it,” that is heightening their expectations. Now they’re  thinking, “Wow. This is really going to be good.” Then they go see the movie – for  example, I don't know, Superman  – and they decide that it isn't a very good movie.  The movie “falls

short of the mark.” The movie does not impress you as much as you were expecting. You don't like it as much as you thought  you would. That's what happened here, according to Brandon.

He says, “We need to always remember to under promi se and over deliver.” “To under promise” means not to promise very much – to promise someone less, in fact, than what you are actually going to give them . “To over deliver” is the opposite idea. “To over deliver” is to give them mo re than what they were expecting. When you “under promise and over deliver ,” you tell your customer that you're not going to give them very much, so th ey don't have high expectations, but then you give them more than what  they expected, and that makes them even happier.

Karen agrees with Brandon. She says, “Yes, that was  a big part of the problem, but we also need to have more transparency.” “Trans parency” (transparency) refers to showing people how you are doing somethin g, or being honest with people – telling them exactly what is going on.

Karen says, “We can't make major changes without fi rst getting customer input and without notifying them well in advance.” “Input ” would be information, opinions, feedback – in this case, from your custom ers. “To notify someone” means to inform them, to tell them something, to gi ve them some news. “In advance” means before something happens. You can bu y your tickets in advance for the movie. You can go online; you can b uy the ticket before you even go to the movie theater.

Karen says they should not make changes in their pr oduct without first talking to their customers – “getting customer input” – and wi thout “notifying them” or telling them “well in advance,” before the changes take pla ce. “Otherwise,” Karen says, “our customers feel betrayed.” “To feel betrayed” ( betrayed) means to feel someone has treated you unfairly, someone has done something wrong to you. You feel hurt.

“Betrayal” is usually connected with trust. If you are dating someone and you find out that that person is also dating another person and didn't tell you that, well, that would be an example of a betrayal. You would f eel betrayed. You trusted that person and then they did something to hurt you . Brandon then asks, “Should I call a general meeting to talk specifics?” “To ta lk specifics” means to talk about something in great detail, to talk about all the pa rticular things, the individual things, you are going to do to help solve a problem .

Karen says, “Sure, and while we’re at it, we can wo rk on employee morale, too!” “While we’re at it,” means while we are doing this other thing, we can also do something else. For example, “We’re planning to cle an our house on Saturday. While we’re at it, I also plan on cleaning the gara ge.” We’re going to do two things here – one thing and then another thing. “Wh ile we’re at it” means to do two things at the same time, or in the process of d oing one thing, you're also going to do something else.

Karen is talking about improving “employee morale.”  “Morale” (morale) is how people feel about something, especially how excited  or motivated they are to accomplish some task. “Employee morale” would be ho w your employees feel: Do they like what they're doing? Are they excited a bout what they're doing? Do they want to do what they are doing?

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive speed.

[start of dialogue]

Karen: The scandal over our new product line really  damaged our image, and we need to rebuild consumer trust.

Brandon: This is going to be an uphill battle. Losi ng customers is easy. Winning them back will be really hard.

Karen: I agree, but our stock is taking a beating a nd we need to do something now.

This episode is a dialogue between Emma and Uday ab out forgetting about things that have happened to you in the past. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: I think it’s time.

Uday: I beg to differ.

Emma: You can’t live in the past. I know that you l ike reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.

Uday: I don’t want to move on. If you’ve had the li fe I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.

Emma: But your best days are still to come. Constan tly harking back to days gone by doesn’t allow you to live in the moment and  to plan for the future.

Uday: So what? I have my memories to comfort me in my old age.

Emma: You’re speaking as though your life were over . You’re still young.

Uday: Not as young as I used to be.

Emma: These old trophies and football jerseys won’t  keep you young.

Uday: Yes, but they help me remember some of the hi ghlights of the old days. Did I ever tell you about the time I single-handedl y won the game?

Emma: Uh . . .

[end of dialogue]

Emma begins our dialogue by saying to Uday, “I thin k it's time.” “It's time” is a phrase we use to mean that something should be done  right now, immediately, without waiting. We’re not sure exactly what Emma is talking about, however – what needs to be done right now. We don't know yet.  We do know that Uday then says, “I beg to differ.” “To beg (beg) to differ” is an old phrase, a very formal phrase that is used to show that you disagree with another person. “I beg to differ” means I think you're wrong, or I disagree w ith you.

Emma says, “You can't live in the past.” “To live i n the past” is to spend all of your time thinking about things that have happened to you last year, last month, maybe 20 years ago. That would be to live in the pa st – not to be thinking about your future or even your present, but to be constan tly thinking about things that you did many years ago. Emma says, “I know that you  like reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.” “To relive” means to live again. Really, it means to experience somethin g again or to think about something as if it were happening right now.

“To relive your glory days” would be to continue to  think about, or try to do again, the things that you did in your “glory days,” or the days when you were popular or successful. The term “glory days” refers to the bes t days of your life. There was a song by Bruce Springsteen many years ago called “Gl ory Days,” about someone who was looking back at the times when he was succe ssful in his life.

Emma says that it's fun to relive your glory days, “but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.” “To move on” means to conti nue with the future without thinking about things that have happened in the pas t. Usually we use this expression, this phrasal verb, when something bad h as happened to us, and perhaps it's preventing us from moving forward, fro m continuing with our lives. Your girlfriend decides to break up with you. You n eed to move on – you need to find another girlfriend who will also, of course, b reak up with you, but that's not the idea here.

“To move on” means to continue forward with your li fe without worrying about the past. Emma also uses the expression here “to let go  of the past.” “To let go of the past” means something similar: to stop thinking abo ut things that have happened in the past and, instead, to think about your futur e.

Uday says, “I don't want to move on. If you’ve had the life I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.” “To cling” (cling) means to hold ti ghtly onto something. However, here it means to think about your past all the time  – not to be able to forget about it. “To cling to your past” would be the opposite of “letting go of your past.” “To let go of” something means to stop holding it, to stop gripping it. Uday doesn't want to let go of the past. He wants to cling to the pas t.

Emma says, “But your best days are still to come.” Emma is saying that the best things in Uday’s life haven't happened yet, so he s hould be looking forward to what will happen to him, not thinking about the pas t. Emma says, “Constantly harking back to days gone by doesn't allow you to l ive in the moment and to plan for the future.” “To hark (hark) back to” something  means to refer to something that happened in the past, to remind you of somethi ng that has happened in the past. “Days gone by” is a somewhat poetical way of saying “the past” – things that have already happened.

Emma says that you can't “live in the moment” and “ plan for the future” if you are constantly thinking about the past. “To live in the  moment” means to live in the present – to think about and focus on what is happe ning to you right now, not what happened to you yesterday or 10 years ago – an d not to think about what will happen even in the future, but instead to thin k about what is going on in your life right now, at this very minute. Emma is asking  Uday to forget about his past and to live in the moment, as well as to plan for the future.

Uday says, “So what? I have my memories to comfort me in my old age.” Uday is saying “So what,” meaning “Why is that important?” What you are saying to me isn’t important. “I have my memories to comfort me. ” Your “memories” are things that you remember. “To comfort” means to make you f eel calm or relaxed, to feel good about yourself. Uday is saying that he has his  memories to comfort him in his old age – as he gets older.

Emma says, “You’re speaking as though your life wer e over. You're still young.” Uday says, “Not as young as I used to be.” He means  he's not as young as he was last year or 10 years ago, which of course is o bvious. No one is younger now than they were in the past; that doesn't make a ny sense. The reason Uday says this is to indicate that he is aware that he is getting older. He is no longer as young as he wants to be.

When someone says, “not as young as I used to be,” it means “I'm old. I don't feel young the way I used to feel young.” I feel th at way sometimes. When I have to move some heavy boxes, for example, and the next  day my back hurts, I say

to myself, “I'm not as young as I used to be.” I tr y to tell my wife that so that I don't have to move the boxes, but she never listens .

Anyway, Emma says, “These old trophies and football  jerseys won't keep you young.” A “trophy” (trophy) is usually an object th at looks like a small statue that is given to someone who wins a competition. It is u sually tall, made of metal and wood, and has the name of the person who won, or at  least the prize that they won. “Trophies” are usually given for big competiti ons – sporting competitions or other events.

Emma says, “These old trophies and football jerseys  won't keep you young.” A “jersey” (jersey) is a shirt that you wear when you  are participating in some athletic activity. When you are a member of a sport s team, you have team jerseys. They all have the same color, the same des ign. Typically, jerseys will have numbers on them. That's your number as a playe r. In my glory days as an 8th grade volleyball player, I had the number 10. T hat was the number on my jersey. Oh, those were the days.

Emma says the “old trophies and football jerseys” –  and here she means American football – “won't keep you young.” You won 't become young by keeping these old things. Uday says, “Yes, that's t rue, but they help me remember some of the highlights of the old days.” “ Highlights” are the best or most important moments or parts of some story or so me situation.

Uday says, “Did I ever tell you about the time I si ngle-handedly won the game?” Uday is asking Emma if she remembers him telling the story about how, during one game, he “single-handedly” won it. “Single-hand edly” means alone, without help from anyone else.

Of course, husbands like to tell their wives storie s of their glory days, and usually they tell them many, many times, and I think that's  the situation here with Emma. Emma says, “Uh . . . ,” meaning she does know the s tory and she doesn't really want to hear it again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: I think it’s time.

Uday: I beg to differ.

Emma: You can’t live in the past. I know that you l ike reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.

Uday: I don’t want to move on. If you’ve had the li fe I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.

This episode is a dialogue between Jack and Chrissy  about watching a movie with special effects. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chrissy: Wow, that movie was amazing, but I can’t b elieve that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I bet the French are really pissed.

Jack: You’re kidding, right? They didn’t really blo w up the Eiffel Tower. They used special effects to make it look that way.

Chrissy: Are you sure? It really looked like the re al thing.

Jack: They used a scale model or a computer-generat ed image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechnics or other visual e ffects to create what you saw on the screen. It’s like a big optical illusion . I can’t believe you really thought they blew up the Eiffel Tower.

Chrissy: Oh no, I didn’t. I was just kidding. But y ou have to admit that it was pretty cool that they got the real president of the  United States to kill that monster, right?

Jack: You must be messing with my mind again. That wasn’t the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standin g in front of a green screen. They added the monster later in post-produc tion.

Chrissy: Oh, right, sure. But you have to hand it to them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City, right?

Jack: Oh, boy . . .

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Chrissy saying, “Wow, that  movie was amazing, but I can't believe that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I  bet the French are really pissed.” “To blow up” something is to destroy it, to make it explode. “Blow up” is a two-word phrasal verb, of course. It's used here to  indicate that something was destroyed, usually with a bomb or some sort of expl osive. Chrissy is saying that in the movie, they blew up the Eiffel Tower.

The Eiffel Tower is the most famous monument of Par is – the most famous site in Paris. That's why Chrissy says, “I bet the Frenc h are really pissed.” “To be pissed” (pissed) is something of a vulgar term, whi ch we don't normally talk about on the episodes here. But it's here in our dialogue , so I'll explain that it means to be angry – to be very, very angry or upset. However , it's not a word you should use normally, especially in front of your boss or i n front of your family. A much better expression here would be “angry” or “upset,”  which is what this word means.

Jack says, “You're kidding, right?” meaning “You're  joking, right?” He says, “They didn't really blow up the Eiffel Tower. They used s pecial effects to make it look that way.” “Special effects” are techniques that are used in television and movie production. You think something is happening, even though in reality it isn't. In this case, it looks like the Eiffel Tower is being destroyed in the movie, but Jack says no, that did not actually happen; they used sp ecial effects.

He says they use special effects to "make it look t hat way.” He means they use special effects so that it appears as though the Ei ffel Tower were destroyed. Chrissy says, “Are you sure? It really looked like the real thing.” Immediately, we get the sense that Chrissy might not be the most in telligent person in this conversation. Jack says, “They used a scale model o r a computer-generated image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechni cs or other visual effects to create what you saw on the screen.”

There are several somewhat difficult terms in that sentence. Let's go back to the beginning where Jack says, “They used a scale (scal e) model (model).” A “scale model” would be a small representation of an object , but it's not the real object. If you go to Paris, you can probably buy a little Eiff el Tower that's maybe three inches tall. It's not the actual Eiffel Tower. It's  what you might call a scale model. It looks exactly the same, but it is made to be a very small size. That's what Jack is saying they used in this movie.

“Or,” he says, “they used a computer-generated imag e.” A “computer-generated image” would be something that you would create usi ng software on your computer. Jack says also that they added “some pyro technics or other visual effects.” “Pyrotechnics” (pyrotechnics) means firew orks – explosions that produce bright lights and colors and, typically, fi re. That's “pyrotechnics.”

Jack says, “They may have used pyrotechnics or visu al effects.” “Visual effects” are just special effects that are not sound, but so mething that you see. “Visual” (visual) refers to that which you can see, or somet hing that can be seen. Jack continues, “It's like a big optical illusion.” An “ illusion” (illusion) is something that looks real but it isn’t. An “optical (optical) illu sion” is something that makes your eyes think something is going on when it isn't real ly going on. It looks like it's one thing, but it in fact is another thing. That would be an “optical illusion.”

Jack says, “I can't believe you really thought they  blew up the Eiffel Tower.” Jack can't believe that Chrissy could be that stupid. Bu t Chrissy says, “Oh no, I didn't. I was just kidding.” Now Chrissy says that she wasn't  serious, that she knew that they didn't really blow up the Eiffel Tower – right . When we use that word “right” with the intonation that I just used, you’re really  saying “I don't believe you. I don't think that's true.”

Chrissy says, “You have to admit that it was pretty  cool that they got the real president of the United States to kill that monster , right?” So now Chrissy says something else incredibly stupid. She says that the  real president of the United States killed the monster in the movie. A “monster”  (monster) is a large, ugly, imaginary creature, an animal that doesn't really e xist but that you are very scared of. If you remember the movie Frankenstein , Frankenstein was what we would call a monster – kind of like my neighbor.

Jack says, “You must be messing with my mind again. ” Jack is saying to Chrissy that she is “messing” with his mind. “To mess” (mes s) with someone's mind means to try to trick another person, try to fool a nother person, try to get someone to believe something is true that really is n't true. It's somewhat of an informal expression. “To mess with” in general mean s to interfere with or to cause problems with. It could be used in a physical  sense. “To mess with” someone would be perhaps to fight them, to hit them .

There's an old expression: “Don't mess with Texas.”  “Don't mess with Texas” means don't get into a fight or criticize or anger anyone from the state of Texas. The state of Texas, which is located in the south-c entral part of the United States on the border with Mexico, has a reputation of bein g a state that has a lot of

pride, where everything is bigger – at least, that' s what they think in Texas. But we’re not dealing with Texas here. We’re dealing wi th Chrissy.

Jack says, “That wasn't the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standing in front of a green screen.” “Prost hetics” (prosthetics) are artificial body parts used sometimes for people who  lose their arms or lose one of their legs. Here, it's something that an actor woul d put on to make him look different. “Makeup” is something you would put typi cally on your face to make you look different. Women put makeup on to make the m look more beautiful.

A “green screen” is a wall that is green. A “green screen” is used in movie and television production in order to put a different b ackground behind the person – but that is done after you actually make the film, after you actually film the video. You then can go back, if the background is green, a nd change what is behind the person so that it looks like something different.

Jack says, “They added the monster later in post-pr oduction.” “Post-production” is the final stages, the final steps in making a mo vie or a television show or a record or a podcast. “Post-production” is what happ ens after you do the recording. It's all of the things that happen to ge t the recording – whether it's audio or visual – ready to release, ready to publis h.

Chrissy says, “Oh, right, sure, but you have to han d it to them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City , right?” The expression “to hand (hand) it to” someone means to compliment them , to say that they did something very well. Chrissy is saying that in the movie, they took a section of the Great Wall of China and moved it to New York Ci ty. That's what Chrissy thinks. That's why she says, “You have to hand it to them.” You have to congratulate the people who made the movie for doing such an amazing thing.

Of course, that's not actually what happened, but t hat's what Chrissy thinks. That's why Jack ends our dialogue by saying, “Oh, b oy.” That expression, “Oh, boy” is when you are frustrated, or you can't belie ve how stupid the other person is, or you can't believe the crazy ideas that the o ther person has. Chrissy certainly has some crazy ideas.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chrissy: Wow, that movie was amazing, but I can’t b elieve that they blew up the Eiffel Tower. I bet the French are really pissed.

 Jack: You’re kidding, right? They didn’t really blo w up the Eiffel Tower. They used special effects to make it look that way.

Chrissy: Are you sure? It really looked like the re al thing.

Jack: They used a scale model or a computer-generat ed image of the Eiffel Tower and added some pyrotechnics or other visual e ffects to create what you saw on the screen. It’s like a big optical illusion . I can’t believe you really thought they blew up the Eiffel Tower.

Chrissy: Oh no, I didn’t. I was just kidding. But y ou have to admit that it was pretty cool that they got the real president of the  United States to kill that monster, right?

Jack: You must be messing with my mind again. That wasn’t the president. That was an actor wearing prosthetics and makeup standin g in front of a green screen. They added the monster later in post-produc tion.

Chrissy: Oh, right, sure. But you have to hand it to them for moving a section of the Great Wall of China to New York City, right?

Jack: Oh, boy . . .

We hope that our scriptwriter never messes with our  minds. I don't think she would. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Luc y Tse.

# Showing Signs of Age

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 935 – Showing Signs of Age.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 935. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there to download a L earning Guide for this episode. You can also take a look at some of our sp ecial courses in business and daily English.

This episode is a dialogue between Julian and Vera about getting old. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julian: What is that, another gray hair?! My hair is already thinning on top. I don’t need more gray hairs.

Vera: I think salt and pepper hair looks great on m en. It makes them look distinguished.

Julian: It makes them look old. Thank God I don’t h ave a receding hairline – yet.

Vera: When you get to be my age, you won’t worry so  much about graying hair. There are a lot of other things to worry about.

Julian: Like what?

Vera: Forget I mentioned it. Showing signs of age i sn’t something to be lamented. It’s natural and part of maturing as a pe rson. It gives you character.

Julian: Stop being evasive. Like what?

Vera: Okay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness a nd memory loss.

Julian: Gee, thanks. If I ever need to talk someone  off a ledge, I’ll give you a call!

[end of dialogue]

Julian begins by saying, “What is that, another gra y hair?” A “gray hair” is a hair that has changed color because someone is getting o ld. It's usually not gray; it's more like white hair. If you have a lot of white ha ir or gray hair, it may mean – not always – but it may mean that you are getting old.

Julian says, “My hair is already thinning on top.” The verb “to thin” refers here to hair that is falling out of your head – out of the top of your head, what we would call your “scalp” (scalp). Your “scalp” is the skin  on the top of your head. As you get older, sometimes the hair begins to fall out an d doesn't grow back. So, you have less hair on the top of your head than you did  when you were younger. This is certainly true for people like me.

Julian says, “I don't need more gray hairs.” Vera s ays, “I think salt and pepper hair looks great on men.” The expression “salt and pepper hair” refers to hair that is both black and white. Some of it is black or bro wn. Some of it is white due to the graying of the hair. “Salt,” of course, is whit e. Pepper is black. So, that's where we get the expression “salt and pepper hair.”  That's what Vera is talking about.

She thinks that salt and pepper hair “looks great o n men. It makes them look distinguished.” “To be distinguished” means to be d ignified. If you are distinguished, you get respect from other people. I t looks like you are someone of importance, someone who has authority. Julian doesn 't agree with Vera. He says, “It makes them look old,” meaning the salt an d pepper hair makes men look old.

He says, “Thank God I don't have a receding hairlin e – yet.” Your “hairline” (hairline) is what separates, on the top of your he ad, the part where you have hair and the part where there is just skin. So, if you start at your eyes and you move up on the top of your head past your forehead,  most people eventually will have hair somewhere at the top of the head. The lin e that separates the hair from the skin that has no hair is called your “hairline. ”

The verb “to recede” (recede) means to move back. A  “receding hairline,” then, is a hairline that appears to be moving back, because you're losing more and more hair on the front part of your head. Julian says he  does not have a receding hairline yet. That word “yet” means that he expects  probably, someday, that that will happen as well.

Vera says, “When you get to be my age” – when you a re as old as I am – “you don't worry so much about graying hair. There are a  lot of other things to worry about.” Julian says, “Like what?” He means, “Give m e some examples of other

things I have to worry about as I get older.” Vera says, “Forget I mentioned it.” She says, “Forget I mentioned it,” because she's co mmunicating to Julian that he doesn't really want to know – that the news is very  bad and he will probably be better off not knowing this bad news.

She says, “Showing signs of age isn't something to be lamented.” “To show signs of age” means to see changes in your physical appea rance that indicate that you are getting older. That could mean getting gray hai r. It could mean losing your hair. It could mean that your skin is not as soft a s it used to be. It could mean that you are not able to run as fast as you used to. The re could be a lot of signs of old age. It could mean repeating things that you just s aid a minute ago. There could be a lot of signs of old age. It could mean we . . . wait a minute, am I repeating myself?

Vera says that “old age is not something to be lame nted.” “To lament” (lament) means to feel sad about something, especially somet hing that you may have lost. Another word we use here would be “to mourn” (mourn ). Usually, mourning is something you do when someone dies. You feel sad th at you have lost that person. “Lamenting” is a more general term that cou ld be used to describe the loss of anything or the feeling of sadness because something has been lost or something bad has happened.

Vera says it's a natural part of “maturing as a per son. It gives you character.” Vera is talking about showing signs of age. She say s, “It's natural and part of maturing as a person.” She’s saying that it's a nor mal part of getting older and wiser. “To mature” (mature) means to become older, but also to become wiser – to know more than you did when you were young.

Vera says, “It gives you character” (character). “C haracter” here means personality, something that makes you different fro m other people. In this context, it's a positive thing. “To have character”  means to be a good person. It's a compliment to say that someone has a lot of chara cter. Vera says that showing signs of age “gives you character.”

Julian then says, “Stop being evasive.” “To be evas ive” (evasive) means to hide something – to not give a clear, direct answer to s omeone's question. Julian repeats the question, “Like what?” He's asking for examples of other things one has to worry about as one gets older. Vera says, “O kay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness and memory loss.” “Wrinkles” (wrink les) are small “folds,” we call them, in your skin. They're sort of like small line s on your skin that form as you get older. I have lots of wrinkles already and I'm only 29.

Another thing you get when you get older, according  to Vera, are “age spots.” “Age spots” are small areas on your skin that have a different color than the skin around it. It's often caused by being out in the su n too much. If you live in a place like Los Angeles, you may be out in the sun more th an people in other parts of the country, which is why you may see more people w ith age spots in California than you do in Minnesota, where it is less sunny.

Vera says a couple of other problems of getting old  are “deafness and memory loss.” “Deafness” (deafness) is the inability to he ar. When you can't hear anything, that is a sign of deafness. Beethoven, the great composer, was partially deaf and got more deaf as he got older, I believe. “Memory loss,” we've already talked about, is when you forget things, when you c an't remember something. That's memory loss.

Julian says, “Gee, thanks.” That expression, “Gee, thanks,” is used sarcastically here. Julian isn't really thanking Vera. He's not h appy that Vera told him this information, but to be fair to Vera, she did tell J ulian that he didn't want to hear this bad news. That's why she was being evasive.

Julian says, “If I ever need to talk someone off a ledge, I'll give you a call.” A “ledge” (ledge) is something you see on some buildi ngs, outside of a window or somewhere on the wall on the side of the building. A “ledge” is a horizontal space that comes out from the wall. It's at 90 degrees fr om the wall. The wall is vertical; it goes up and down. A ledge is horizontal. It goes  out from the side of the wall. Sometimes the ledge is big enough that you can actu ally walk on it.

Now, if you are out on the ledge, however, you may be trying to kill yourself. You may be trying to jump off the ledge and kill yourse lf. So, that's the meaning behind Julian's statement here, “If I ever need to talk someone off a ledge.” “To talk someone off a ledge” would be to convince some one not to kill himself – to come away from the ledge, to come back into the bui lding to be safe.

Julian is making a joke here. He is saying that Ver a is very depressing. Her news is very depressing, and he would not want her to be  talking to someone else who was depressed and who perhaps was trying to kill hi mself, because she is so depressing.

That's why he says, “If I ever need to talk someone  off a ledge, I'll give you a call.” He's being sarcastic again. He's making a jo ke. He’s saying, really, “I will not call you because you are so depressing.” The pe rson will probably want to jump off the ledge after talking to you instead of coming back into the building.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Julian: What is that, another gray hair?! My hair is already thinning on top. I don’t need more gray hairs.

Vera: I think salt and pepper hair looks great on m en. It makes them look distinguished.

Julian: It makes them look old. Thank God I don’t h ave a receding hairline – yet.

Vera: When you get to be my age, you won’t worry so  much about graying hair. There are a lot of other things to worry about.

Julian: Like what?

Julian: Stop being evasive. Like what?

Vera: Okay, like wrinkles and age spots, deafness a nd memory loss.

Julian: Gee, thanks. If I ever need to talk someone  off a ledge, I’ll give you a call!

# Working With the IT Department

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 936 – Working with the IT Department.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 936. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. You probably know that a lready, but did you know that you can become a member of ESL Podcast and dow nload a Learning Guide? You did? You knew that? Oh, okay.

Our topic today is working with an IT or Informatio n Technology department – those are the people in your company who know how y our computer is supposed to work. Let's get started.  > Whenever I have a technology problem at work, I try  to solve it myself. It’s not that I know a lot of about technology. In fact, the  opposite is true. I’m pretty much a computer illiterate, but I still try.
> Why do I bother? The answer is the IT department in  my company. Every time I consult one of the IT specialists, they make me fee l like an idiot. But this time, I had no choice but to call in the experts.
> ***
> Leah: What seems to be the problem here?
> Steve: My computer is acting up and I can’t get this file to open.
> Leah: Move. Let me take a look. Ha, of course your computer is acting up. I don’t know what you did to it, but it’s really screwed up .
> Steve: I’m not sure how I could have done that.
> Leah: Me neither. This is configured all wrong. And  the reason you can’t open this file is because it’s encrypted. Did that occur  to you?
> Steve: No, I guess I didn’t.
> Our story begins with Steve describing his situatio n at work. He says, “Whenever I have a technology problem at work, I try to solve  it myself.” “Technology” refers to anything, really, that is made by humans that he lps you accomplish some goal or task. Normally, nowadays, we associate technolog y with things like computers and phones and other electronic devices. Steve is s aying that if he has a problem at work with technology, he tries to solve it himse lf – to find the answer himself.

He says, “It's not that I know a lot about technolo gy. In fact, the opposite is true.” If, for example, the water is cold and your friend says, “Oh, the water is hot,” you can say, “No, the opposite is true.” The opposite of “hot” would be “cold.” In our story it's a little confusing because Steve says, “ It's not that I know a lot about technology.” We know that Steve does not know a lot  about technology, because he's saying “it's not that,” which means “it is not  true that.” The statement that is not true is, “I know a lot about technology.” Then,  Steve says, “The opposite is true” – the opposite of that statement, “I know a l ot about technology,” is true. In other words, Steve does not know very much about te chnology.

He says, “I'm pretty much a computer illiterate, bu t I try.” “Pretty much” means primarily, mostly, for the most part. “Literate” (l iterate) usually refers to your ability to read and write in a given language. “Illiterate”  (illiterate) means that you cannot read or write. However, we use “literate” nowadays sometimes to means “skilled” – to have knowledge about something. “Computer illi terate” means he doesn't know very much about computers.

Steve says, “Why do I bother?” “Why do I bother” me ans “Why do I trouble myself?” Why do I make an effort to do something th at may not be successful? “The answer is the IT department in my company,” St eve says. The “IT department” is the Information Technology departmen t – the part of a company that is responsible for computers and other electro nic devices.

Steve says, “Every time I consult one of the IT spe cialists, they make me feel like an idiot.” “To consult” (consult) can mean a couple  of different things. Here it

means to ask for someone's assistance, to ask for s omeone's help. We often use that in a professional or business context when we are asking for assistance from, in this case, another person in our company.

“Consult” can also be used as a verb to refer to the act of you providing additional services to another company. “I'm consul ting for a textbook company” – I'm working for a company that makes books for st udents. The verb “consult” has those two meanings, one which means to provide assistance – usually for some small issue within your company, in this case.  And, it can mean to work for another company temporarily, to help them with some  larger problem.

The company where Steve works has “IT specialists.”  A “specialist” (specialist) is anyone who knows a lot about a certain topic. You c ould have a specialist in ancient archaeology. You could have a specialist in  Renaissance poetry. You could have a specialist in neurosurgery. All of tho se are possible uses of the word “specialist.” Here, we're talking about someon e who knows a lot about computers. These IT specialists at Steve's company make Steve feel like an idiot; they make him feel stupid. Maybe that's beca use Steve is stupid. I don't know, I've never met Steve.

Steve says, “But this time, I had no choice but to call in the experts,” When you say you “have no choice but to,” that means you hav e no other options. You have to do a certain thing. I have no choice but to eat this piece of chocolate cake. If I don’t eat it, it will be wasted. I'll have to throw  it out. I have no choice but to eat it. Steve has no choice but to call in the experts. “To  call someone in” is a phrasal verb meaning to ask someone to come in and help you  – in this case, with your problem.

So, then we begin our dialogue. Leah says, “What se ems to be the problem here?” Leah is one of the IT specialists. Steve say s, “My computer is acting up and I can't get this file to open.” The phrasal ver b “to act up” here means to cause problems – to not work or function properly. Steve cannot get a file to open on his computer. A “file” is just a general term for any sort of electronic document. It could be a Microsoft Word file. It cou ld be a PDF file. It could be an MP3 file. There are lots of different electronic fi les.

Steve cannot get this file to open. He wants to loo k at it or listen to it and he's unable to do that. Leah says, “Move.” “Move” means move over, leave your seat. There was actually a very funny comedy show a few y ears ago about an IT specialist, and the IT specialist was very rude – w as very condescending, meaning he would talk to people as though they were  idiots, as though he were

the only person who knew anything about computers. That's what Leah is doing here. She’s saying, “Move. Let me take a look” – le t me examine this situation.

She says, “Ha, of course your computer is acting up . I don't know what you did to it, but it's really screwed up.” “To be screwed up”  means to have a lot of problems, to have a major problem. Steve says, “I'm  not sure how I could have done that.” Leah says, “Me neither.” Notice that in  informal English, we usually don't say, “I neither.” That would sound very stran ge to most native speakers of English. We say, “Me neither,” even though it's not  technically grammatically correct. Leah is saying, “I don't know either.”

She says, “This is configured all wrong.” “To confi gure” (configure) means to establish the settings for a computer device or a p iece of software – to go in and determine how it's supposed to operate normally. “T his is configured all wrong,” Leah says. We're not sure what “this” is – perhaps the software program that Steve is trying to use. If it's “configured all wro ng,” it is configured incorrectly.

Leah says, “And the reason you can't open this file  is because it's encrypted.” “Encrypted” (encrypted) comes from the verb “to enc rypt.” “To encrypt” means to protect something with a special code so that no on e can understand what it is or no one, in this case, can open the file because you  put some sort of special protection on it.

You can have encrypted messages where you are sendi ng messages to someone, and perhaps you’re changing the letters in  the words so that no one can understand what you're saying except the person  who knows how to “decrypt” the code. “To decrypt” means to figure ou t what the message is trying to say because you know how it was encrypted. You k now the way that they try to protect it. Sometimes, for security purposes, fi les are encrypted so that they are protected. No one can read them unless they kno w how to decrypt them.

Leah says, “Did that occur to you?” Did you think a bout that as being a possibility? Steve says, “No, I guess I didn't.” Le ah says, “I’ll fix everything, but try not to screw it up again.” Leah is saying, “Try not  to break it again” or “Try not to do something that would cause it to act up again.” Steve says, “I'll do my best,” meaning “I'll try not to.”

Then, at the end of the story, we hear Steve say, “ See what I mean?” That expression, “See what I mean?” as a question is use d to indicate that you have just shown an example or given evidence for some st atement that you made previously. At the beginning of the story, Steve wa s saying that he didn't like to call someone from the IT department because the peo ple who worked there were

not very nice to him. They made him feel like an id iot. Then he gives us an example of this in his dialogue with Leah.

So, at the end of the story, he can say, “See what I mean?” meaning “I was right.” I showed you. Here is the evidence, and you  should, therefore, agree with my statement.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of story]

Whenever I have a technology problem at work, I try  to solve it myself. It’s not that I know a lot of about technology. In fact, the  opposite is true. I’m pretty much a computer illiterate, but I still try.

Why do I bother? The answer is the IT department in  my company. Every time I consult one of the IT specialists, they make me fee l like an idiot. But this time, I had no choice but to call in the experts.

***

Leah: What seems to be the problem here?

Steve: My computer is acting up and I can’t get this file to open.

Leah: Move. Let me take a look. Ha, of course your computer is acting up. I don’t know what you did to it, but it’s really screwed up .

Steve: I’m not sure how I could have done that.

Leah: Me neither. This is configured all wrong. And  the reason you can’t open this file is because it’s encrypted. Did that occur  to you?

Steve: No, I guess I didn’t.

Leah: I’ll fix everything, but try not to screw it up again.

Steve: I’ll do my best.

*** See what I mean?

# Being a Stay-at-Home Dad

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 937 – Being a Stay-at-Home Dad.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 937. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can find that at ESLPod.com on this crazy thing called the Internet.

Our dialogue today is between Gladys and Dan about the father in the family staying home to take care of the children while the  mother goes out and works. Sounds like fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gladys: Hi, Dan. I’m surprised to see you here at the supermarket in the middle of the day.

Dan: Why?

Gladys: I thought you’d be working.

Dan: I am working. I’m a stay-at-home dad and I tak e care of the kids while my wife goes to work.

Gladys: Oh, did you get laid off from your job?

Dan: No, my wife works full-time out of the house a nd I work full-time at home.

Gladys: You mean that your wife is the breadwinner and you’re a househusband?

Dan: If you want to put it that way, yes. I’m the c aretaker for the kids during the day and I do the household chores.

Gladys: Oh, your wife must be a feminist.

Dan: No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern  sensibilities.

Gladys: Well, I know that some families like to liv e radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.

Dan: We don’t think of it as radical. In fact, it’s  quite common nowadays.

Gladys: if you say so. Tell your wife I’d be happy to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she’s a housewife agai n.

Dan: [sigh]

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gladys saying to Dan, “Hi,  Dan. I'm surprised to see you here at the supermarket in the middle of the da y.” The “supermarket” is the store you go to, to buy food. The “middle of the da y” would be sometime usually between, say, eight in the morning and five in the afternoon, when people are normally working, at least Monday through Friday.

Dan says, “Why?” Why are you surprised? Gladys says , “I thought you'd be working.” Dan says, “I am working. I'm a stay-at-ho me dad and I take care of the kids while my wife goes to work.” A “stay-at-home d ad,” or father, is a dad who does not work outside of the house but instead take s care of the children. In the traditional family, in the United States and in mos t countries, the mother would stay home to take care of the children and the fath er would go out to work.

Times have changed, at least in some families; not in most, but in some families, the father may stay home. I think this is still pro bably fairly rare in the United States, but it does happen. I had a friend of mine who was a stay-at-home dad. His wife worked as a lawyer, and he stayed home to take care of the children. Dan says he's a stay-at-home dad and he takes care of the kids while his wife goes to work.

Gladys says, “Oh, did you get laid off from your jo b?” “To be laid (laid) off” means the employer said that you no longer have a job at that company. The employer said, “I'm sorry. We need to let some people go.” W e need to dismiss you from your job. Normally, when we use the expression “to be laid off,” we mean that the person didn’t do anything wrong. The company let the person go – ended the person’s job – because of some problem in the compa ny or some change in the company.

If we say someone was “fired” (fired), then we are saying that person did something wrong and the company got rid of them. If  you're fired from your job,

it's because you did something wrong. If you're lai d off from your job, it's because the company decided that it needed fewer employees,  or somehow you were no longer needed at the company.

Dan says that he was not laid off. He said, “No, my  wife works full-time out of the house and I work full-time at home.” “Full-time” me ans you’re working at least 40 hours at a job. “To work outside of the home” would  mean to go to another building and work during the day. “To work at home”  would be to stay in your house or apartment and work.

Gladys, however, has having a little difficulty und erstanding the situation. She says, “You mean that your wife is the breadwinner a nd you're a househusband?” “You mean” is short for "Are you saying to me? Do y ou mean?" Gladys is saying that Dan's wife is the breadwinner. “To be a breadw inner” (breadwinner) is to be the person who earns the most money or the majority  of the money for a household. The breadwinner would be the person who is making the most money and therefore supporting the rest of the family.

A “househusband” is a rather new expression. The tr aditional term for a woman staying home would be a “housewife” (housewife) – o ne word. A “househusband” is a husband who stays home and takes care of the h ouse and family. Dan says, “If you want to put it that way, yes.” The expressi on “to put it that way” means to say something in a particular way, especially in a way that you hadn't thought about before or that you hadn't considered before.

Dan says, “I’m the caretaker of the kids during the  day and I do the household chores.” A “caretaker” (caretaker) is someone who t akes care of someone or something. In this case, Dan is referring to him ta king care of their children. “Household chores” refers to things that you do in a house in order to keep it clean and working properly – to make sure that ever ything is getting done that needs to be done. “Household chores” would include washing the windows every once in a while. My wife tells me once every three or four months. I think really once a year is enough, don't you?

Doing the dishes, taking out the trash, cleaning the house, fixing things that break – all of these would be examples of household  chores. The word “chore” (chore) is something you’re required to do that is usually somewhat unpleasant. If you say something is a “chore,” you mean it's diffi cult and not very fun to do. “Household” just refers to things done in a house –  where a “house” refers to an apartment, a townhouse, a condominium, or an actual  separate home.

Gladys says, “Oh, your wife must be a feminist.” A “feminist” (feminist) is a difficult word to define. Everybody has a slightly different definition. In general, people understand the word to mean a woman who is i n favor of equal rights for men and women, who doesn't believe in the tradition al roles or responsibilities and duties that a woman would have, for example, in  a marriage. However, the term has taken on all sorts of political meanings a s well. So, when someone uses it, you have to be very careful to understand what exactly they mean by it.

We’re not exactly sure what Gladys means by saying that Dan's wife is a feminist. It might be a criticism of Dan's wife or a suggestion that Dan's wife is somehow unusual in wanting to work outside of the h ome. Dan says, “No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern sensibiliti es.” That's an interesting response. Dan is saying, “No, my wife is not a femi nist” – again, because the word feminist can sometimes be used negatively as w ell as positively.

Dan doesn't want to use that term to describe his w ife. Instead, he says his wife is “just a modern woman, with modern sensibilities. ” “Sensibility” refers to the way you think about something, the way you feel abo ut a particular thing, or a particular way that something works. The word “mode rn” refers to the way things are done now, in comparison perhaps to the way they  were done 20 years ago or 50 years ago or 100 years ago.

Many people believe “modern” means good, that if it 's something we do now, then it must be good. This, of course, is a rather naïve way of looking at the world. “Naïve” (naïve) means innocent but not very intelligent. I'm not saying, of course, that it's a bad idea that Dan's wife works outside the home. I'm just pointing out the use of the word “modern” here mean s more than just the way we do things now. It's meant to be a very positive des cription of something, typically.

Gladys says, “Well, I know that some families like to live radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.” Gladys is saying t hat what Dan and his wife are doing is “radical” (radical). “To be radical” means  to be very extreme, to be very different than what normal people do. A “lifestyle”  is just the way that you live, the style in which you live, the manner in which you li ve. A “radical lifestyle” would be living in a way that almost no one else does. Glady s talks also about “changing up gender roles.” “To change up” is a phrasal verb that here means to change something in an unexpected or unusual way.

“Gender roles” refers to the way that men and women , boys and girls, act and behave. “To change up gender roles” would be to hav e the man do things that traditionally the woman has done and the woman to d o things that the man has traditionally done, and in a way, that's what Glady s is talking about here with Dan

and his wife. Nowadays, the most common situation is not always the woman staying home and the man working, but both the man and the woman – both the wife and the husband, the mother and the father – w orking outside the home.

Dan says, “We don't think of it as radical.” “In fa ct,” he says, “it's quite common nowadays.” “Nowadays” (nowadays) means currently – this year or in the past five years. Dan is saying it's quite common for wom en to work outside of the home while the father stays home and takes care of the children. I don't think that's true, although it might depend on what you m ean by “common.” How common does it have to be to be considered common? I'm not really sure, but that's what Dan thinks.

Gladys says, “If you say so.” That expression, “If you say so,” is said when you don't believe what the person has just said, but yo u don't really want to argue with them. Gladys says, “Tell your wife I'd be happ y to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she's a housewife agai n.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written instructions about how to prepare a particular type of food. Normally, again, in traditional gender roles the wo man, the mother, would stay home and cook food and would use recipes.

Gladys is perhaps making a little joke here, or per haps trying to criticize Dan by saying that when Dan's wife goes back to being a ho usewife and Dan goes back to working outside of the home, then she can share recipes with the wife. I'm pretty sure she means this as a criticism of Dan an d his wife. Dan just sighs at the end. He goes (sighs), meaning he's frustrated. He decides perhaps that it's not worth continuing to argue with Gladys.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gladys: Hi, Dan. I’m surprised to see you here at the supermarket in the middle of the day.

Dan: Why?

Gladys: I thought you’d be working.

Dan: I am working. I’m a stay-at-home dad and I tak e care of the kids while my wife goes to work.

Gladys: Oh, did you get laid off from your job?

 Dan: No, my wife works full-time out of the house a nd I work full-time at home.

Gladys: You mean that your wife is the breadwinner and you’re a househusband?

Dan: If you want to put it that way, yes. I’m the c aretaker for the kids during the day and I do the household chores.

Gladys: Oh, your wife must be a feminist.

Dan: No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern  sensibilities.

Gladys: Well, I know that some families like to liv e radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.

Dan: We don’t think of it as radical. In fact, it’s  quite common nowadays.

Gladys: if you say so. Tell your wife I’d be happy to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she’s a housewife agai n.

Dan: [sigh]

# Learning to Ride the Subway

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 938 – Learning to Ride the Subway.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 938. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Donny and Cayla about riding on a subway. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Donny: Come on, we need to buy our subway tickets a t that ticket machine.

Cayla: Why can’t we just get them at the ticket win dow? I’m not sure what the fare is.

Donny: There’s a long line and we need to catch a t rain right now.

Cayla: I’ve never taken the subway before. I don’t know how it works.

Donny: Just follow me. Here, take this card and wal k through the turnstile. Put your card in this slot and then retrieve it as you pass through.

Cayla: Okay, now where do we go?

Donny: Let’s look at this subway map showing all of  the lines. That’s the station we want.

Cayla: Don’t we need to get transfers?

Donny: We don’t need transfers to take connecting t rains. Let’s see, we want the express, not the local train . . .

Cayla: Are you sure we shouldn’t just ask somebody,  like a station agent?

Donny: Good luck finding one. And plus, I don’t nee d one. I can figure it out. Follow me. I think that’s the right platform.

Cayla: Are you sure that’s the right train?

Donny: Yes, and if you ask me another question, you  can continue this conversation with those tracks!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about subways. A “subway” (subw ay) is a system of underground trains in a large city that transport p eople from one part of the city to another. Many large cities have subways, all around  the world. Here in the United States, the most famous subway system would probabl y be in New York City. But other cities, such as Washington D.C., have sub way systems. Los Angeles kind of has a subway, not really. It's a very small  section of our transportation system. We do have other types of public transporta tion, but subways aren’t very popular here in Southern California, where everyone  drives a car.

But our dialogue is about subways, and we begin wit h Donny saying, “Come on, we need to buy our subway tickets at that ticket ma chine.” “Come on” is just a way of getting someone's attention – getting them to come with you, in this case. A “ticket machine” is a machine that sells, usually , little pieces of paper that give you permission to enter into something. In this cas e, they give you permission to go on the subway train.

Cayla says, “Why can't we just get them at the tick et window? I'm not sure what the fare is.” A “ticket window” would be a place wh ere there is actually someone working – a real human being that you can talk to a nd, in this case, buy a ticket from. We might call this place a “ticket window.” W e might call it a “ticket counter.” There are other names that you could give  this particular place where someone is working with whom you can speak and from  whom you can buy your ticket.

Cayla says she's not sure what the fare is. The “fa re” (fare) is the amount of money that you have to pay to take a certain kind of transportation. We can talk about “bus fare.” We can talk about “subway fare.” We could talk about “train fare.” In all of these cases, we’re talking about the amount of money it takes to travel from one place to another. On a subway in an  American city nowadays, you probably have to pay $1.50 or $2.00 for each ri de. Maybe it's more. I don't know; I don't ride the subways.

Cayla doesn't know what the fare is, and that's why  she wants to go to a ticket window to ask someone. Donny however says, “There's  a long line and we need to catch a train right now.” “Train” here refers to  the vehicles that are in a subway system that move you from one place to another. We also use the word “train” to talk about transportation that may take you from on e city to another. Cayla says, “I've never taken the subway before.” When she says  she's never “taken” the subway, she means she's never ridden on the subway.  She's never actually been on a subway train. “I don't know how it works” – I don't understand how it functions, how it operates, what the system is.

Donny says, “Just follow me,” meaning do what I do.  “Here,” Donny says, “take this card and walk through the turnstile. Put your card in this slot and then retrieve it as you pass through.” There are a coupl e of different ways that a subway system can function, especially when you are  getting on the subway, when you are entering into the subway system. Usual ly there is some sort of card that you buy that you can use for a number of diffe rent rides. You can typically put on a certain number of rides on your card so yo u can use that card for 10 rides, for example.

When you walk up to enter into the subway system, u sually there is a machine called a “turnstile” (turnstile). The “turnstile” is a small device or machine that allows one person to go through at a time. In the t urnstiles on the subway systems that I've been on, you have to put in your ticket into the machine. The machine will then check to make sure that you have paid, and if you have, then it will allow you to go through this turnstile – to go  through the machine so that you can get on the actual subway train. Sometimes you p ut the ticket in the machine and it comes out on the other side or on top of the  machine. Sometimes you just take the card and you slide it through – you pass it through a certain part of the machine.

Donny is explaining to Cayla that she needs to put her card in this slot. A “slot” (slot) is a small opening for a coin or a ticket in  a machine. In this case, it's the place where the ticket goes in the turnstile. “To r etrieve” (retrieve) means to get something back. You put your ticket into the turnst ile and then you “retrieve” it – the machine gives it back to you. Cayla says, “Okay , now, where do we go?” Donny says, “Let's look at this subway map showing all of the lines.” Most cities have more than one “line.” That is, they have more than one route, more than one direction that a train goes.

You may have one line that goes from downtown to a certain city. You might have another line that goes from the western part of the city to the northern part of the city. A “line,” then, is a route in a bus or  a train system. Usually lines have

either numbers, colors, or names, sometimes all thr ee. You might take the “7 line” in New York City to go from Manhattan to Quee ns, which is another part of New York City. Some cities have colors and each lin e has a different color: the red line, the blue line, the green line. Some citie s give names to the different lines related to where the line goes, typically.

Donny is looking at a subway map with Cayla. He say s, “That's the station we want.” A “station” is a place where you get on and off the subway. In most cities that have subway systems, there are usually dozens of different stations – places where you can get on and off. The stations all have  names associated with the place where the station is located. In some cities,  stations will have symbols also. This is sometimes done in cities where you may have  a large population that either doesn't read or write very well or doesn't s peak the language of that city very well. The stations have symbols that you can l ook at, and even if you don't understand the language you know which station that  is. In our dialogue, Donny is indicating to Cayla which station they want.

Cayla says, “Don't we need to get transfers?” A “tr ansfer” is permission to go from one type of transportation to another. These a re quite common in bus systems. Donny says, however, for the subway system  “we don't need transfers.” He says, “We don't need transfers to take connectin g trains.” A “connecting train” would be a second train that you would get on in or der to get to the place where you want to go. You “transfer” or go from one train  to another. Not when the train is moving, of course.

Donny says, “Let's see, we want the express, not the local train.” In some subway systems there are specific trains that only stop at a limited number of stations. This is to allow people to move more quic kly from the more popular stations, often in the center part of the city, to areas farther away from the city or on the “outer edges,” we might say, of the city. “E xpress trains,” then, don't stop at every station. “Local trains” stop at every sing le station on that line. In the New York subway system, for example, if you get on a lo cal train, you will stop at every station. That will take you a longer amount of time, of course. An express train is a lot faster, but it will only stop at som e of the stations, not all of the stations.

Donny is saying that he and Cayla need an express t rain. They don't need to ride the local train. Cayla says, “Are you sure we shoul dn't just ask somebody, like a station agent?” A “station agent” is a person who w orks for the subway system, whose job it is to help people find which train the y should get on. Personally, I’ve been on many different subway systems all around the world, and I haven't seen very many station agents there to help people, but I guess they do exist.

 Donny says, “Good luck finding one.” And that's exa ctly right. Donny is saying it's very difficult to find a station agent in most subw ay stations. That's why he says, “Good luck finding one. And plus, I don't need one.  I can figure it out” – I can understand it. “Follow me. I think that's the right  platform.” A “platform” (platform) is the area where people stand before getting on the train. It's where the train comes to a stop and people are able to get on and o ff the train. The platform is always part of the station. It doesn't move. The tr ain moves.

Cayla says, “Are you sure that's the right train?” – that is, the correct train. Donny says, “Yes, and if you ask me another question, you  can continue this conversation with those tracks.” “Tracks” (tracks) are the long parallel pieces of metal that the train actually rides on. We call tho se “tracks.” Donny is making a joke, saying that if Cayla keeps asking questions, she can have a conversation with the tracks because Donny won't be there anymor e; he'll be on one of the trains that has already left.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Donny: Come on, we need to buy our subway tickets a t that ticket machine.

Cayla: Why can’t we just get them at the ticket win dow? I’m not sure what the fare is.

Donny: There’s a long line and we need to catch a t rain right now.

# Planning a Wedding

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 939 – Planning a Wedding.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 939. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. If you want a Learning G uide for this episode, become a member of ESL Podcast by going to our webs ite.

This episode is a dialogue between Seamus and Cathy  about getting married. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Seamus: What’s that?

Cathy: It’s a planning book for our wedding.

Seamus: We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.

Cathy: I know, but there are so many things to plan . We have to book the hall far in advance, you know, and once we set the date, we have to send out save-the- date notifications to our friends and family.

Seamus: I thought that the point of putting off the  wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us time to pl an – later.

Cathy: It is, but it’s never too early to start pla nning for a wedding. I’m meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the bal l rolling.

Seamus: A wedding coordinator?! We don’t need a wed ding coordinator. We can make all of the arrangements ourselves.

Cathy: You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception. There are caterers, photographers and videographers , entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the swans  and the doves), and . . .

Seamus: Are you serious?! You’re not planning a wed ding. You’re starting a circus!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Seamus asking Cathy, “What 's that?” Cathy says, “It's a planning book for our wedding.” A “wedding” is when  two people get married. It's the ceremony in which two people get married. They promise, usually, to be with the other person until they die. Of course, a lot of them are lying because they don't stay with the person until they die, but that 's the idea anyway. That's what you are thinking when you get married, and you get married in a ceremony called your “wedding.”

Seamus says, “We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.” Seamus is saying that they are still 18 months away from the actual wedding. He's a little surprised, I think, that Cathy is already planning the wedding. Cathy says, “I know, but there are so many things to plan. We have  to book the hall far in advance.” “To book” means to reserve, to make a res ervation. The “hall” (hall) refers to the place where the wedding reception wil l take place.

The word “reception” means, basically, the party – the celebration that will happen after the wedding. We call that the “wedding  reception.” We do not call it the wedding party, because the “wedding party” refe rs to the people . . . the bride, the groom – the woman and man getting marrie d – and the other people who are in their wedding, who are their close frien ds or family members, typically. Cathy says that they have to book the hall “far in advance.” The phrase “far in advance” means long before something happens, well before the actual date that this event will take place. Cathy says they “have to book the hall far in advance.”

She also says, “Once we set the date, we have to se nd out save-the-date notifications to our friends and family.” “To set ( set) the date” means to select or determine the exact date that you are going to get married. “We're going to get married on June 23rd. That's the day we will get ma rried.” That is “setting the date.” You can set the date for any important event . You can set the date for the beginning of a new project in your company.

It's common in the United States, when two people d ecide to get married, to tell their friends and family as soon as they have set the date. They do this so that their friends and family can “save the date.” “To s ave a date” means to put it on your calendar and not plan anything else because yo u want to go to this event. “To save the date” means to leave that date free so  that you can attend, in this case, the wedding. A “notification” is either a let ter or an email or some way of communicating news to you. “Save-the-date notificat ions” are often sent out as little postcards, although nowadays I guess you wou ld send an email to tell

people the day that you are getting married so that  they will be able to save the date.

Seamus says, “I thought that the point of putting o ff the wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us tim e to plan – later.” Seamus is explaining why he's a little surprised that Cathy wants to start planning the wedding. He says, “I thought the point of putting o ff the wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off.” The “point” he re means the purpose, the reason for doing something. Seamus is saying that I  thought the reason we were putting off the wedding was to take the pressure of f. “To put off” something means to delay it, to decide you're going to do it at a later date.

“To take the pressure off” means to do something th at will make a situation less stressful, perhaps by making it at a later date so you have more time to do whatever it is that is causing you stress. Seamus a nd Cathy apparently decided that they would finish school – perhaps they are co llege students – before getting married. That's why they put off the wedding until after they finish school. This was done to take the pressure off of them – to make  the situation less stressful, so they don't have to worry about studying for scho ol and planning for their wedding.

Cathy says, “It is,” meaning that is the reason why  we put off the wedding, “but it's never too early to start planning for a weddin g.” Cathy says, “I'm meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the ball rol ling.” A “wedding coordinator” is a person whose job is to help other people plan their weddings. Some people hire a wedding coordinator to help them find out wh ich hall they should book, which caterer they should use. A “caterer” is a per son who provides the food for an event such as a wedding and so forth. I did not have a wedding coordinator. My wedding coordinator was my now wife.

However, some people who have more money may actual ly hire someone to help them plan their wedding. The word “coordinator ” comes from the verb “to coordinate,” which means to organize things – to ma ke sure that everything is working properly, that everyone is doing the right thing, the thing they're supposed to do. Cathy is meeting with the wedding c oordinator next week “to get the ball rolling.” The expression “to get the ball rolling” means to get something started, to make something begin to happen. We ofte n use that expression when we’re talking about a large project, for example.

Seamus says, “A wedding coordinator?!” He's very su rprised. “We don't need a wedding coordinator,” he says. “We can make all [of ] the arrangements ourselves.” “Arrangements” here means plans. Seamus  is saying that they don't

need a wedding coordinator. Cathy disagrees. She sa ys, “You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception.” “To  go into” something here means to be involved in something, to be a requirem ent for something else to happen.

“To pull off” something or “to pull something off” is a phrasal verb meaning to successfully implement or execute something – to ma ke something happen successfully. That's “to pull off.” We usually use that phrasal verb when it may be very complicated or difficult to be successful at d oing something. Cathy says that Seamus has no idea – doesn't know – how difficult it is to pull off a wedding and reception. He has no idea what goes into that plann ing.

Cathy says, “There are caterers, photographers and videographers, entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the s wans and the doves), and . . .” And here Seamus interrupts her. Let's go back and e xplain what she was talking about. She says there are caterers. A “caterer” is the person who makes the food, who prepares the food for the big event, as w e mentioned earlier.

A “photographer,” of course, would be someone who t akes photographs, pictures. A “videographer” would be someone who mak es a movie of your event. Nowadays, it's very popular for people to hire some one to make a little movie about their wedding. I never had this, but I got ma rried, I guess, before this became popular. “Entertainers” are people who sing or dance or do something to entertain or to keep people happy at a large event.

“Ice sculptors” are people who make little figures or statues out of ice. For some reason, at American weddings it’s very popular, at least in some places, for people to get a sculpture made out of ice, usually in the shape of some animal, and use that in the wedding reception. Usually it's  placed near the food. When my oldest brother got married – this was back in the early 1970s – he and his wife had someone make a swan, which is a kind of an imal. They hired an ice sculptor to make this figure out of ice.

“Animal trainers” are people who make animals behav e or make animals perform tricks, I suppose. “Swans,” we mentioned, refers to  a type of bird. “Doves” are another type of bird. Cathy is saying, I guess, tha t she wants to have actual animals at her wedding. That is not typical. That is not usual or normal. Having someone make an ice sculpture for you is not that u nusual, but certainly having animals at your wedding (other than perhaps your in -laws – the relatives of your spouse, of the person you are marrying) is not typi cal, is not common.

Seamus says, “Are you serious?! You're not planning  a wedding. You're starting a circus!” A “circus” (circus) is a kind of enterta inment. It's basically a large show that involves a lot of animals and animals doing tr icks, that sort of thing. Seamus is very surprised that Cathy is mentioning having a nimals at the wedding, and he should be surprised because that is a very strange thing. Maybe Seamus should think again about marrying Cathy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Seamus: What’s that?

Cathy: It’s a planning book for our wedding.

Seamus: We aren’t getting married for a year and a half.

Cathy: I know, but there are so many things to plan . We have to book the hall far in advance, you know, and once we set the date, we have to send out save-the- date notifications to our friends and family.

Seamus: I thought that the point of putting off the  wedding until we finish school is to take the pressure off and allow us time to pl an – later.

Cathy: It is, but it’s never too early to start pla nning for a wedding. I’m meeting with a wedding coordinator next week to get the bal l rolling.

Seamus: A wedding coordinator?! We don’t need a wed ding coordinator. We can make all of the arrangements ourselves.

Cathy: You have no idea what goes into pulling off a wedding and reception. There are caterers, photographers and videographers , entertainers, ice sculptors, animal trainers (you know, for the swans  and the doves), and . . .

Seamus: Are you serious?! You’re not planning a wed ding. You’re starting a circus!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 940 – Ending Excessive Spending.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Raphael and Kelly about spending too much money. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raphael: Sorry to be a buzzkill, but this gravy tra in we’ve been on is about to end.

Kelly: What do you mean?

Raphael: There have been a lot of complaints about our department’s spending on extraneous things, and to quell the masses, the department head is making some major changes.

Kelly: Like what?

Raphael: Like no more frivolous and excessive spend ing on travel and entertainment at conferences.

Kelly: But those are the only things that make this  job bearable. Those perks are part and parcel of working for a government agency – at least that’s what I used to think.

Raphael: Well, once the press got wind of some of o ur spending practices, they started to question our budget allocations. The lon g and short of it is that those days are about to end.

Kelly: And I was planning to take you and few other  employees to St. Lucia for a retreat in the spring.

 Raphael: I think you’d better change those plans, a t least the venue. You’d have better luck getting it approved if you picked Cleve land!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Raphael saying to Kelly, “ Sorry to be a buzzkill.” A “buzzkill” (buzzkill) is a person who spoils or rui ns everyone else's fun. Basically, a “buzzkill” is a person who does something to stop  other people from having fun while they're in the middle of having fun. They do something or say something that makes everyone no longer enjoy themselves. Tha t's a “buzzkill.” There's an older term, a little less common nowadays, for this  same idea, which is a “party pooper” (pooper). A “party pooper” is the same as a  buzzkill. The word “buzz” is sometimes used to mean excitement – a certain atmos phere in a situation or place. That's probably the origin of this term “buz zkill.”

Raphael says he's sorry to be a buzzkill, “but this  gravy train we've been on is about to end.” “Gravy (gravy) train (train)” is a s ituation where you have a lot of money, or people are able to make a lot of money ve ry easily. A gravy train would be a really good situation financially – some thing either that is making you a lot of money or that is allowing you to spend a l ot of money. Raphael talks about being on a gravy train just like you would be  on a regular train or on a bus or another form of transportation. Unfortunately, the gravy train “is about to end,” R aphael says.

Kelly says, “What do you mean?” He says, “There hav e been a lot of complaints about our department's spending on extraneous thing s.” A “complaint” is an objection to something that is going on that you do n't like. You can have a complaint at a restaurant if your food is bad. Here , people are complaining – notice the verb “to complain” – “about our departme nt’s spending on extraneous things.” “Spending” is the money that you pay for s omething. “Extraneous” (extraneous) means extra and unnecessary. Something  that is “extraneous” is something that is more than what is needed. It's to o much. It's not required.

Raphael and Kelly's department has been spending mo ney on extraneous things, “and to quell the masses, the department head is ma king some major changes.” The “department head” would be the person who is the top boss, top manager, in a department in a company. A “department” is just o ne part of a larger company – one division, perhaps, of a company. The departme nt head is making some major, or very important or large, changes.

He's doing this “to quell the masses.” This is an i nteresting expression. “To quell (quell) the masses (masses)” means to try to make p eople feel calmer, to try to do things that will address or answer people's conc erns or complaints. The “masses” refers to a large group of people. “To que ll” here means to quiet down, to make happy, people who are unhappy because of a bad situation.

Kelly says, “Like what?” meaning “What are these ma jor changes?” Raphael says, “Like no more frivolous and excessive spendin g on travel and entertainment at conferences.” Something that is “f rivolous” (frivolous) is not very important, silly. Something that is “frivolous” is not worth paying close attention to. “Excessive” means too much. This department has  been spending too much on travel and entertainment at conferences. A “conf erence” is a large meeting where people who have similar interests come togeth er and talk to each other.

Many kinds of work have conferences where once a ye ar or perhaps twice a year you can go and learn more about your particular are a. It might be a business conference. It might be an academic conference with  university professors. It might be a conference for people who work in the go vernment. There are conferences all over the United States – all over the world – for lots of different kinds of interests and activities. In fact, in most  cities in the United States – in most big cities in the United States – you will fin d “conference centers.” These are places that are built especially for these kind s of large group meetings.

Kelly says, “But those are [the only] things that make this job bearable.” “To be bearable” (bearable) means to be tolerable – someth ing that you can put up with. Something that is “bearable” is something that is n ot so terrible that you want to quit or stop doing whatever it is you're doing. Kel ly says that going to these conferences, for example, is one of the things that  makes her job “bearable.” It might not be a very good job, but it's okay because  she can go to these conferences and spend a lot of money. That's kind of how I felt about my university job.

Kelly says, “Those perks are part and parcel of wor king for a government agency – at least that's what I used to think.” A “perk” ( perk) is a benefit, especially a benefit from working at a certain place from your j ob. It might be something like free parking at the building, or you get a free lun ch every day. There are companies here in California that give their employ ees lunch for free every day. It's one of the perks of the job. Of course, they d o that so that people will stay in the building and work more.

Kelly says these perks are “part and parcel” (parce l). “Part and parcel” is an old expression meaning a necessary part of something – something that you have to

do or something that cannot be avoided. We learned that Kelly and Raphael work for the government, which is why they have so much money to spend. Raphael says, “Well, once the press got wind of some of our  spending practices, they started to question our budget allocations.” The “p ress” here refers to the media: newspapers, magazines, television stations, and so forth – people who work in the area of journalism, of reporting the news.

“To get wind of something” is an expression that me ans to find out about, to hear about something. “Spending practices” just refers to the things that you spend money on, the way that you spend your money. “Budge t allocations” refers to your plans about how you're going to spend your mon ey. A “budget” (budget) is a plan for spending money. “Allocations” are the thin gs that you actually spend the money on. The press got wind of the spending practi ces of this department and they “started to question” – they started to ask qu estions about and to complain about, really, these budget allocations.

Raphael says, “The long and the short of it is that  those days are about to end.” “The long and the short of it” is a phrase we use to give someone the most important point about a difficult or complex situat ion. It's a way of introducing the conclusion or the most important thing you want to say to someone. If you're telling someone a long, complicated story, you may try to summarize everything by saying, “The long and short of it is . . .”

Kelly says, “And I was planning to take you and a f ew other employees to St. Lucia for a retreat in the spring.” St. Lucia is an  island in the Caribbean. A “retreat” (retreat) is usually a long meeting that you have outside of your offices, at a hotel or at a very nice resort somewhere away from where you work. Usually, a retreat lasts two or three days, and it' s a time for leaders in a company or an organization to come together and talk about their plans for the future. That's a typical topic at a retreat.

There are also religious retreats were people go aw ay for a couple of days in order to pray and participate in religious activiti es. But Kelly isn’t thinking of anything religious here when she talks about this r etreat, since St. Lucia is one of the most expensive islands to go to in the Caribbea n. Raphael says, “I think you'd better change those plans, at least the venue .” The “venue” (venue) is the place where some event is held. It’s the location w here you, in this case, would be having your meeting.

Raphael says, “You'd have better luck getting it ap proved if you picked Cleveland.” Raphael is saying to Kelly that she wil l have a better chance of getting her plan approved to have a retreat if she has it in Cleveland rather than

St. Lucia. Cleveland is a city in the eastern part of the United States, in the state of Ohio. The reason that Raphael says Cleveland is that it's not a very nice city to visit. I’ve been to Cleveland. It seems okay. But it's not a place where people would go in order to have a vacation, and a lot of times these retreats are places that are nice, that are places where you would go o n a vacation, like Hawaii or St. Lucia.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Raphael: Sorry to be a buzzkill, but this gravy tra in we’ve been on is about to end.

Kelly: What do you mean?

Raphael: There have been a lot of complaints about our department’s spending on extraneous things, and to quell the masses, the department head is making some major changes.

# Types of Shopping Areas

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 941 – Types of Shopping Areas.

This episode is going to be about places where you can go and buy things. Sounds like fun. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sarah: Come on! We only have two more hours before the stores close, and I want to make it to the outlet stores.

Aidan: I thought that when you asked if I wanted to  spend the day together, you meant we’d go somewhere for lunch, go to a movie, o r just hang out.

Sarah: Isn’t this much more fun? Shopping centers a re like Disneyland!

Aidan: This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.

Sara: Just look. You have two shopping malls, retai l stores, outlet stores, department stores, and specialty stores. What more could you want?

Aidan: That’s great for you, but what am I supposed  to do?

Sarah: You can come with me, watch me try on clothe s, and help me decide what to buy. Come on, I want to go to those stores in the strip mall over there.

Aidan: Why don’t I just find a place to get a snack  and wait for you? I’m just dead weight when it comes to shopping.

Sarah: But I thought you wanted to spend the day to gether.

Aidan: I did, but I didn’t know I’d have to go to s hopping hell to do it.

[end of dialogue]

Sarah begins by saying to Aidan, “Come on! We only have two more hours before the stores close, and I want to make it to the outlet stores.” “Come on” is something you say to someone when you want them, in  this case, to come with you, to get moving. Sarah says they have only two m ore hours before the stores close, and she wants to “make it to the outlet stor es.” “To make it” there means to get there before they close. An “outlet (outlet) st ore” is a store that sells a famous company or a famous brand’s clothing at a lower pri ce, at a discounted price. An outlet store could, for example, sell things by Guc ci or by one of the big fashion designers, but they sell it at a very low price com pared to what you would normally pay for it.

Aidan says, “I thought that when you asked if I wan ted to spend the day together, you meant we’d go somewhere for lunch, go to a movi e, or just hang out.” Sarah invited Aiden to spend the day with her. Aidan thou ght it was going to be doing something fun like going to a movie or just hanging  out. “To hang (hang) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to spend time with an other person in a relaxed way without really any plans, without trying to get  anything done. You may just go and sit with this person and talk.

Sarah says, “Isn't this much more fun?” That is, is n’t going shopping more fun? “Shopping centers are like Disneyland.” A shopping center is an area where you have many different stores that are close to each o ther. Usually, shopping centers have a big place for you to park, a parking  lot or a building where you can park. At least, here in Los Angeles that's what  all the shopping centers have.

Disneyland is a theme park – an entertainment park – in Southern California, not too far from Los Angeles, where people I guess go a nd have a good time. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and other Disney characters can be found at Disneyland. What Sarah is referring to here is a ve ry fun place to go. That's why she says shopping centers are like Disneyland. It's  just like going to Disneyland; you can have just as much fun.

Aidan doesn't agree. He says, “This wasn't exactly what I had in mind.” “To have something in mind” (mind) is a common expression me aning to be thinking about a particular thing. Someone says, “I want to go to a new restaurant,” and you say, “Well, what did you have in mind?” What were y ou thinking of? What ideas did you have? Sarah says, “Just look. You have two shopping malls, retail stores, outlet stores, department stores, and specialty sto res. What more could you want?” Sarah is explaining to Aidan why this place that they have gone to is so interesting and so exciting.

 She's pointing to all of these different places, sa ying, “Just look” – just look at all of these places. “You have two shopping malls.” A “ shopping mall” (mall) is a shopping center that is all in one big building. A “shopping center” is typically, or can be, a place where you walk outside to get from store to store. There are several buildings next to each other, usually with a parking lot in front for cars. A “shopping mall” is a huge building where you don't have to walk outside to go from one store to another.

The original concept of shopping malls began in par t in my home state of Minnesota. Because it's so cold during the winter, they wanted to build a place where people could go shopping and not have to walk  outside to go from one store to another. That's at least one of the reason s why they built shopping malls. Now there are shopping malls all over the United St ates and all over the world. Usually when we use the term “shopping mall,” we’re  always referring to one of these large buildings. When we say “shopping center ” we are usually talking about a place where you have to walk outside to get  from store to store.

A “retail store” is really any store that sells any thing to anyone who comes in the door. The word “retail” (retail) is used to disting uish it from a wholesale store. A “wholesale (wholesale) store” is a place where you have to be a business or belong to a large group in order to buy things, and  typically when you do buy things, you can buy them at a discount. The idea, then, is that you would buy these things and then sell them to someone else at a retail store. So, a “wholesale store” is sort of a store for other stor es.

Nowadays, however, things have gotten more confusin g. You'll see stores that will sell to individual members of the public, indi vidual people, but call themselves a “wholesale store” or “wholesale outlet.” The word  “wholesale” is associated in people's minds with a discount – a lower price – an d that's why we have now retail stores that sell to individuals and wholesal e stores that sell to individuals.

Sarah goes on and talks about the other kinds of sh opping areas. She mentions “department stores.” A “department store” is a larg e store in a single building that sells a lot of different kinds of things. They migh t sell clothing; they might sell appliances for your kitchen; they might sell gym eq uipment; they might sell jewelry. All of these different products are in one  single building, in one single store. That's a “department store.” There are diffe rent sections or “departments” that sell different things within the store.

A “specialty store” is a store that sells only one kind of item, often something that is very specific. For example, it might be a store that sells Rolex watches – a very

expensive watch – and that's all they sell. It’s ju st that kind of watch. That would be a very good example of a “specialty store.” Sara h asks Aidan, “What more could you want?” This is an expression meaning “This is everything. This is the best. How can you possibly want to do anything else  or want anything else?” Aidan says, “That's great for you, but what am I su pposed to do?” “Supposed to do” here means expected to do.

Sarah says, “You can come with me, watch me try on clothes, and help me decide what to buy.” “To try on” clothes is a phras al verb meaning to put them on in the store to see if you want to buy them. Most s tores that sell clothing will allow you to put the clothing on to see if it looks good on you. When I do that, the clothes never look good on me. The idea is that if you can try them on, you will be more likely to buy them. Sarah is telling Aidan that she is going to go and try on clothes, and Aidan can watch her and help her de cide which clothes to buy.

“Come on,” she says, “I want to go to those stores in the strip mall over there.” The word “strip” (strip) can have a couple of diffe rent meanings in English. It can mean to take your clothes off. It can also refer to  a long narrow piece of some material. The term “strip mall” refers to a small s hopping center that is usually just one small strip of buildings, maybe four or fi ve buildings, or four or five stores in a single building all next to each other with a small parking lot out in front. So, a “strip mall” is a kind of shopping center that is  very small; often it just has five or six stores in it.

Aidan says, “Why don't I just find a place to get a  snack and wait for you?” A “snack” would be a small something to eat. He says,  “I’m just dead weight when it comes to shopping.” The term “dead weight” (weig ht) refers to someone or something that is making the situation more difficu lt because either the person or the thing doesn't really help very much, doesn't re ally add anything. In fact, it slows things down, perhaps. That would be “dead wei ght.” If you say “He was dead weight,” you mean he didn't help very much. It  was more of a burden to have him there than if he were not there. Aidan say s he's “dead weight when it comes to shopping,” meaning regarding or related to  shopping.

Sarah says, “But I thought you wanted to spend the day together.” Aidan says, “I did” – meaning I did want to spend the day together  – “but I didn't know I'd have to go to (a) shopping hell to do it.” A “shopping h ell” (hell) would be a terrible place to go. “Hell” is the opposite of “heaven.” In  certain religious traditions, especially in the Christian religious tradition, “h ell” is where you go if you don't go to heaven, or at least if you're not eventually going to go to heaven.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Sarah: Come on! We only have two more hours before the stores close, and I want to make it to the outlet stores.

Aidan: I thought that when you asked if I wanted to  spend the day together, you meant we’d go somewhere for lunch, go to a movie, o r just hang out.

# Daily Chores on a Farm

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 942 – Daily Chores on a Farm.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 942. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast by going to our website.

This dialogue is between Cesar and Karol about work ing on a farm, a place where they have animals and other exciting things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar: Rise and shine! It’s time to get to work.

Karol: What?! It’s four o’clock in the morning. The  sun isn’t even up yet.

Cesar: You live on a farm now. We have a lot of cho res to do before sunup and we need to start doing them now.

Karol: I’ll milk the cows later. Let me sleep to a decent hour.

Cesar: All right, you can milk the cows a little la ter, but we have to feed and water the animals now. We also have to clean out the stal ls and groom the animals before we start repairs on the fences.

Karol: Why can’t we do those things when the sun is  up and we can see what we’re doing?

Cesar: Because we’ll need daylight hours to tend to  the crops. We’re done with planting, but we’ll need to do the watering and wee ding. Just be glad that the harvest is three months away.

Karol: I don’t think I’m cut out to be a farmhand.

Cesar: You should have thought of that before agree ing to spend the summer at your uncle’s farm. Now move!

Karol: But I thought I’d spend the days learning ho w to ride horses.

Cesar: City girls!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Cesar saying to Karol, “Ri se and shine!” This expression, “Rise (rise) and shine (shine),” is use d when you want to wake someone up, someone who is sleeping. This is especi ally used when you want to seem very happy, when you want to seem what we woul d call “cheerful.” “Rise and shine everyone!” You are telling everyone to wa ke up.

Sometimes it's used sarcastically or jokingly when you are telling someone that they have been sleeping too long. You might say this to your children, for example, on Saturday morning if they are sleeping t oo late. You might say, “Rise and shine everyone.” Typically, it's used when you have somewhere to go or something to do and you need everyone to wake up in  order to do it. The verb “to rise” means to get up, to get out of your bed. “Shi ne” here, I guess, could mean happy. If you're telling someone to shine, you want  them to do well. You want them to be smiling, perhaps.

Cesar is telling Karol to rise and shine because it 's time to get to work. Karol says, “What?! It's four o'clock in the morning.” It 's four a.m. “The sun isn't even up yet.” When we say “the sun is up,” we mean the s un is in the sky. It is no longer nighttime. Cesar says, “You live on a farm n ow.” A “farm” is a place where you grow plants for food. You can also have animals  that are also used to produce food. Sometimes the animals are the food. C hickens, for example, produce eggs which you can eat and then you can eat  the chicken. Cesar and Karol are on a farm.

Cesar says, “We have a lot of chores to do before s unup and we need to start doing them now.” “Chores” (chores) are tasks that y ou have to perform, especially related to cleaning or taking care of so mething such as your house or, in this case, animals. Farm chores would probably b e related to doing things that are required to keep the farm operating. In general , the word “chore” is used for a task that is not very pleasant, that you don't real ly want to do. Cesar says that he and Karol have to do these chores before “sunup” (s unup). “Sunup” is sunrise – the time when the sun appears in the sky and the da y begins.

Karol says, “I’ll milk the cows later.” “To milk (m ilk) a cow (cow)” is to take your hands or to use a machine to take milk from a cow. A “cow” is an animal that

produces milk. We also get beef from a cow. We call  the meat of the cow “beef” – steaks, hamburgers, that sort of thing. That meat is called “beef,” and it comes from a cow. “Milk” is also a noun referring to the liquid that comes out of a cow. You can also have other kinds of milk from other an imals, such as goat’s milk. Karol says she'll milk the cows later. “Let me slee p to a decent hour,” she says. A “decent (decent) hour” here means a time that isn't  too early or too late, a time that is considered normal for doing certain kinds of tasks.

Cesar says, “All right, you can milk the cows a lit tle later, but we have to feed and water the animals now.” “To feed (feed) and water the animals” means to take care of the animals by giving them food to eat and fresh water to drink. Cesar says, “We also have to clean out the stalls and gro om the animals before we start repairs on the fences.” “To clean out” is a t wo-word phrasal verb that means basically the same as to clean. The word “out” is j ust used for emphasis. It could mean to completely remove everything from a place. “I'm going to clean out my desk” means I'm going to remove everything from my desk. That's what you do if you lose your job. You have to clean out your desk.  Here, we’re talking about making something cleaner – getting rid of the dirt and whatever else is there.

Cesar and Karol need to clean out the “stalls” (sta lls). A “stall” is a small section, a small area, in a barn that is separated from othe r areas by a wall and is used usually to keep an animal in, such as a horse. A “b arn” is a large building where you keep animals and farm equipment. The verb “to g room” (groom) means to clean an animal, often including brushing its fur, its hair. It may also mean to do other things to the animal in order to keep it clea n and healthy.

The verb “to groom” can also be used with humans. You can talk about “grooming” yourself. That might include cutting you r hair, shaving, making sure you look handsome or pretty. I try to groom myself so that I don't look too ugly. I look ugly even after I groom myself, but not as ugl y as I would if I didn't groom myself. The word “groom,” interestingly enough, is also used for a man who is about to get married. The woman is called a “bride”  (bride) and the man is called the groom. I'm not sure if there's a connection the re between husbands and animals, quite possibly.

Cesar says they need to groom the animals “before w e start repairs on the fences.” A “fence” (fence) is a short wall that goe s around a certain area, a certain piece of property, that is usually made fro m wood or metal. A fence is designed either to keep something in, such as your animals so they don't escape, or to keep something out, such as your neighbors. T hat's a fence. There's an old expression, “Good fences make good neighbors,” mean ing be careful what kind of fence you put up to separate you from your neigh bor. You want to make sure

that you don't make them angry by putting up your f ence. I made my former neighbor angry by putting up a fence, but that's an other story.

Karol says, “Why can't we do those things when the sun is up and we can see what we're doing?” Cesar says, “Because we’ll need daylight hours to tend to the crops.” Karol wants to wait until the sun is up, bu t Cesar says no, we have to save that time, those “daylight hours to tend to” –  or take care of – “the crops.” The term “daylight hours” refers to the time of the  day when the sun is out, when the sun is in the sky. “Crops” (crops) refers to pl ants that you grow in order to eat or sometimes to make clothing or, for some of you, to smoke.

Cesar says, “We’re done with the planting, but we’l l need it to do the watering and weeding. Just be glad the harvest is three mont hs away.” “Planting” refers to putting seeds in the ground so that you can grow ne w plants. You can also plant a plant. The word “plant” can be used as a noun, to  refer to the things that grow out of the ground. It's also used here as a verb me aning to put things into the ground so that they grow.

Cesar says they need to do the watering and weeding . “To weed” (weed) means to get rid of the unwanted plants, the plants that you don't want from your garden nor from your farm. Cesar says, “Just be glad,” mea ning you should be happy, “that the harvest is three months away.” The “harve st” (harvest) is the process of taking all the plants out of where they are growing  – out of the “fields,” we would say – and bringing them in so you can sell them or eat them or do whatever you’re going to do with them.

Karol says, “I don't think I'm cut out to be a farm hand.” The expression “to be cut out to be” something means to be qualified or prepa red to do something. Perhaps you don't have the interest or you don't ha ve the right attitude or, simply, you don't have the skills to do something. I am not  cut out to be a professional baseball player. I would like to be, but I am not c ut out to be. I don't have the preparation or the skills. But I can watch baseball  on television, so that's almost as good as being a real player.

Karol says she's not cut out to be a “farmhand” (fa rmhand), one word. A “farmhand” is a person who works on a farm, especia lly one who does physical work – “physical labor” we would call it. Cesar say s, “You should have thought of that before agreeing to spend the summer at your un cle's farm.” Karol, we now learn, is “spending the summer” – staying for the m onths of June, July, and August – at her uncle's farm. Karol says, “But I th ought I'd spend the days learning how to ride horses.” Karol thought that go ing to a farm was going to

mean riding horses and doing fun things, not gettin g up early and milking the cows.

Cesar ends our dialogue by saying, “City girls!” A “city girl” or a “city boy” is an insulting phrase to describe someone who lives in the city and doesn't know anything about farming. People who live on farms wo uld use this term about people who live in cities and don't know how to do anything that needs to be done on a farm. I am, for example, definitely a cit y boy.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar: Rise and shine! It’s time to get to work.

Karol: What?! It’s four o’clock in the morning. The  sun isn’t even up yet.

Cesar: You live on a farm now. We have a lot of cho res to do before sunup and we need to start doing them now.

Karol: I’ll milk the cows later. Let me sleep to a decent hour.

Cesar: All right, you can milk the cows a little la ter, but we have to feed and water the animals now. We also have to clean out the stal ls and groom the animals before we start repairs on the fences.

Karol: Why can’t we do those things when the sun is  up and we can see what we’re doing?

Cesar: Because we’ll need daylight hours to tend to  the crops. We’re done with planting, but we’ll need to do the watering and wee ding. Just be glad that the harvest is three months away.

Karol: I don’t think I’m cut out to be a farmhand.

Cesar: You should have thought of that before agree ing to spend the summer at your uncle’s farm. Now move!

Karol: But I thought I’d spend the days learning ho w to ride horses.

Cesar: City girls!

This episode is a story about making a will – a pla n for what happens to your property when you are no longer on this earth. Let' s get started.  > Last week, I got a wake-up call. One of my oldest f riends from high school died suddenly in an accident, leaving no will. With no e state planning at all, his assets went into probate and his dependents were left in l imbo.
> My friend was a young man, the same age as me. At o ur age, who thinks about estate planning? Well, he should have, and I’m star ting right now to put my affairs in order.
> I’ve already decided who will be my beneficiaries a nd how much of an inheritance each family member will get. One big de cision I’m still thinking about is who should be my executor. I want to make sure m y bequests are carried out and my assets are properly disposed of, so this per son has to be trustworthy.
> After I make those decisions, I’ll write a holograp hic will. It’s the simplest way of drawing up a will and adding codicils without an at torney, and since I’m still of sound mind, there shouldn’t be any problems. I’ll a sk my neighbors to be witnesses.
> Before I start drawing up my will, though, I still have one other important decision to make. Who should get custody of my eight cats?

This episode is about the happy topic of death – wh at happens not to you when you die, but to everything that you own. We’re talk ing in this story about making a

will. A “will” (will) is a legal document saying wh at should happen to your money and the other things that you own after you die. If  you want to give your car, when you die, to your friend, you have to put that in your will. It's a written, typically, statement that says what you want to hav e happen to your property, to the things you own, after you die.

Our story begins when I say, “Last week, I got a wa ke-up call.” “To wake up” means to stop sleeping, to be conscious again. A “w ake-up call” is when someone calls you, for example, at a hotel to wake you up in the morning. Hotels used to do that – some hotels still do – back befor e they put alarm clocks in all of the rooms, which is pretty common nowadays in most hotels. You could ask the hotel to call you on the telephone and wake you up at a certain hour. As I said, there are many hotels that still do that.

The expression “to get a wake-up call,” however, is  a little different. It means to experience something surprising, something shocking , or to see someone else experience something, often negative, that makes yo u think again about your own life and what you are doing with your life. “To  get a wake-up call” is always used to indicate that you are seeing something or r ealizing something that you didn't realize before, and now your view of the wor ld is a little different.

I said, “I got a wake-up call. One of my oldest fri ends from high school died suddenly in an accident, leaving no will.” This did  not actually happen. It's just a story, but it could happen. Someone dies in an acci dent and doesn't leave a will, doesn't leave a legal statement saying where they want their property to go. “With no estate planning at all, his assets went in to probate and his dependents were left in limbo.”

The word “estate” (estate) can mean a couple of dif ferent things. Here, it refers to all the money and things that you own when you die.  That's your estate. “Estate planning” is deciding before you die what is going to happen to your things and, more importantly, how to make things easy for the p eople who you will give your things to. “Estate planning” could include things l ike making sure that the government doesn't take all of what you have in ord er to pay taxes, because in most places, in many places in the U.S., you have to pay taxes to the government, especially if you have a lot of money w hen you die.

“Assets” (assets) refers to something you own, some thing that has value. It could be money. It could be jewelry. It could be a house.  All of those are assets. The word “probate” (probate) refers to the legal proces s where the government – the courts – decide how your assets are going to be giv en out. The technical word we would use here is “distributed.” “How will your assets be distributed?” If you

die and you don't leave a will, then the government  determines who gets your money based on certain laws and rules that have bee n set up for that situation.

A “dependent” is a person who is financially depend ing on or financially connected to another person, usually someone who do esn't have their own job or doesn't have another source of income, or at least not very much income. “To be left in limbo” (limbo) means to be in an uncertain condition, uncertain situation. You're not quite sure what the final decision is go ing to be about what you're going to get, in this case. “To be left in limbo” m eans to not know what is going to happen to you. This is typically used when someone has to make a decision about something, but he or she hasn't made that dec ision yet.

In the story, I say that my friend did not have any  estate planning, so “his assets went into probate and his dependents were left in l imbo.” The government is going to decide who gets his money, and the people who were depending on him – the people who were perhaps receiving money from him when he died – now are in a situation where they don't know what they' re going to get. “My friend was a young man,” I say, “the same age as me.” Well, I' m not that young, but young enough. “At our age,” I say, “who thinks about esta te planning?” People who are young don't think about dying and what will happen to them when they die, so they don't think about things like wills and estate  planning.

“Well,” I continue, “he should have” – meaning he s hould have thought of that – “and I'm starting right now to put my affairs in or der.” The expression “to put your affairs (affairs) in order” means to prepare for yo ur death by making sure all of your documents are in place for the people who have  to come after you and take care of your assets. To make sure that you have a w ill would be another part of putting your affairs in order. It's an expression w e use when someone is getting ready to die, in a way, or at least getting prepare d in case they do die.

I then say, “I've already decided who will be my be neficiaries and how much of an inheritance each family member will get.” A “ben eficiary” is a person who receives some benefit, often a person who receives money or other things after someone else dies. “Beneficiaries” could also get m oney from, for example, an insurance policy. “Inheritance” refers to the money  or the things that a person will actually get. We use the verb “to leave someone.” “ I'm going to leave you my car.” That means that when I die, your inheritance – the thing that you will get from me – is my car. Or my bike. I'm not sure if I want to give you my car, but definitely my bicycle.

I continue, “One big decision I'm still thinking ab out is who should be my executor.” The “executor” (executor) is the person who is responsible for taking

care of your affairs, your financial affairs, after  you die. “I want to make sure my bequests are carried out,” I say. A “bequest” (bequ est) is another word for the money or property that is given to a person or to a n organization – to a beneficiary – after you die. It's similar to the id ea of an inheritance. The word “inheritance” usually refers to a family member, so meone you are related to. If that person gets something, you could call that an inheritance. If it's another person, a friend, or an organization, we would talk  about a “bequest.”

I want to make sure that my bequest is carried out – that the money actually goes to the people I want my money to go to. I also talk  about my assets being “properly disposed of,” meaning the person who is m y executor does with the money what I want him to do with the money. “After I make those decisions, I’ll write a holographic will.” A “holographic (holograp hic) will” is a will that is written by hand. That's all the word “holographic” means he re. Written by hand, not typed on a typewriter – if you still own a typewrit er – or on a keyboard or computer and then printed out on a printer. Those t ypes of wills are not holographic wills. A holographic will is written by  hand, the old way.

I say that a holographic will is the “simplest way of drawing up a will and adding codicils without an attorney.” “To draw up” somethi ng, or “to draw something up,” means to prepare and write out a document, especial ly a formal document. “We’re going to draw up a contract” – we’re going to prepare an agreement to buy a new house. “To draw up the will” would mean to prepare the will: to write it down, to get it ready so that it can be used. A “co dicil” (codicil) is like an amendment to your will. It's something that you add  to your will after you have written it. Maybe you've changed your mind about gi ving your car to your nephew. You can write a codicil giving your car to someone else, or your bike.

Then I say, “Since I'm still of sound mind, there s houldn't be any problems.” The expression “sound mind” is often used in legal situ ations. It means the person is rational, is able to think clearly. Basically, that  the person isn't crazy. In order to write and sign a will, you have to be of sound mind . If you're not, then the government may not carry out the terms of your will  – what you say you want done in your will after you die.

I then say, “I'll ask my neighbors to be witnesses. ” A “witness” in this case is a person who sees you sign the will yourself. A witne ss is saying, “Yes, this person actually signed the will, and I was there to see it .” Witnesses are required for certain kinds of special contracts or documents, in cluding a will.

I end by saying, “Before I start drawing up my will , though, I still have one other important decision to make. Who should get custody of my eight cats?” “Custody”

(custody) refers to the responsibility that a perso n has to take care of someone such as a young child or an animal. When a husband and wife divorce, someone gets custody of the children. Perhaps the mother ge ts custody of the children, meaning she will be the one who is primarily respon sible for the child and has the legal authority to make decisions for the child.

We don't talk about custody for someone who is an a dult and who is of sound mind. If you have some sort of mental difficulties,  then it's possible that someone would have custody of you. They would have the lega l authority and right to make decisions for you. We don't normally talk abou t getting custody of an animal, and certainly not a cat. That last sentence  is a good indication that this story is completely made-up.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.  > Last week, I got a wake-up call. One of my oldest f riends from high school died suddenly in an accident, leaving no will. With no e state planning at all, his assets went into probate and his dependents were left in l imbo.
> My friend was a young man, the same age as me. At o ur age, who thinks about estate planning? Well, he should have, and I’m star ting right now to put my affairs in order.

This episode is a dialogue between Jonas and Crysta l about working as an intern in a company. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jonas: How’s your new job?

Crystal: It’s not a job exactly. It’s an internship .

Jonas: Oh, so you’re working as somebody’s lackey a nd getting paid a pittance.

Crystal: No, not exactly. I’m doing a lot of scut w ork and I’m not getting paid a lot, but I’m getting very valuable on-the-job experience .

Jonas: Sure you are. You’re learning how to fetch c offee and run errands. Yippee! You don’t have to tell me any more. I know all about it. It’s slave labor.

Crystal: No, it’s not! I’m shadowing one of the man agers part of the day and I sit in on important meetings all the time. My mentor sh ows me how things are done in the business world and gives me great career adv ice.

Jonas: Well, then you’re lucky. Most interns who wo rk for our company learn diddly-squat and spend their time doing menial work . Some of them are even unpaid. What a racket!

Crystal: In that case, I’m glad I don’t work for yo ur  company!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jonas asking Crystal, “How 's your new job?” Crystal says, “It's not a job exactly. It's an internship.”  When we say something isn't “exactly this” or “exactly that,” we’re saying that  it doesn't quite meet the full definition of whatever it is that we are trying to describe it as. Sometimes, we even use it with a little bit of sarcasm, trying to  make a joke: “Exercise isn't exactly fun, but it's good for your body.” Here, it 's being used more in the sense that the word that Jonas uses is not precisely or c ompletely correct. Jonas asked Crystal how her new job is, and Crystal says, “It's  not a job exactly.” That means it doesn't meet the definition of a job.

Instead, she says, “It's an internship.” An “intern ship” (internship) is a temporary position, typically in a business or an organizatio n, usually one that you don't get paid for. The purpose of internships is to give peo ple who don't have a lot of experience, especially students in college, a way of learning more about the area that interests them, the kind of business that inte rests them. Internships are very popular for college students and for those who rece ntly graduated from college.

Jonas says, “Oh, so you're working as somebody’s la ckey and getting paid a pittance.” A “lackey” (lackey) is an older term for  a servant, someone who performs tasks for another person, usually things t hat aren’t very difficult or that don't require a lot of intelligence. A “lackey” is always someone who works for another person. It's definitely an insulting term. “To get paid a pittance” (pittance) is to receive a very small amount of money. A “pitt ance” is a very small amount of something, almost nothing. We often use that when t alking about how much someone gets paid or how much money they got from a  certain activity. If it's a very small amount, we might call it a pittance.

Crystal says, “No, not exactly,” meaning, once agai n, she's not exactly a lackey and getting paid a pittance, although there might b e some truth to that description. She says, “I'm doing a lot of scut wor k and I'm not getting paid a lot, but I'm getting very valuable on-the-job experience .” The expression “scut (scut) work” is used to describe work that is boring – wor k that is repetitive, that doesn't change. It's the same every day, every hour, even. “Scut work” is definitely the kind of work that you don't want to do but someone has to do.

“On-the-job experience” is professional experience you get working at a job, not studying in school. “On-the-job” simply means “whil e you are working.” Jonas says, “Sure you are.” Jonas is joking here. He's be ing sarcastic. Crystal is saying that she's getting valuable on-the-job experience, even though she doing a lot of scut work and not getting paid very much. Jonas doe sn't really believe what Crystal says when she says she's getting this on-th e-job experience.

Jonas says, “You're learning how to fetch coffee an d run errands.” “To fetch” (fetch) means to go get something for someone and bring it back to them. “To fetch” means to obtain. It's often used when talkin g about a dog going and fetching something, some object, and bringing it ba ck to his owner. The classic example of this would be having the dog fetch your newspaper. When your newspaper is delivered to your house in the morning , you could send your dog out to fetch it. I don't have a dog, so I fetch my own newspaper.

Jonas is talking about “fetching coffee,” meaning g etting coffee for the bosses, and he also mentions the task of “running errands.”  An “errand” (errand) is something you have to do away from your house or wh ere you are working. “To run an errand” means to go to, for example, somewhe re like the post office or a grocery store or the pharmacy, when you have, usual ly small things that you need to do, at some place away from where you are w orking or living. “Errands” are usually things that aren’t very important and d on't take that much time to complete. We use the verb “to run” with the noun “e rrands.” We talk about “running errands” – that means going and doing diff erent things outside of your house.

“Yippee!” says Jonas. “You don't have to tell me an y more. I know all about it. It's slave labor.” Jonas uses the word “yippee” (yippee) . This is a word that is used to show excitement, to show joy, to show happiness. Ho wever, nowadays it's used mostly by people who are joking, who are being sarc astic. “I went to Las Vegas and gambled and I won ten dollars. Yippee!” I'm bei ng sarcastic there, since winning ten dollars isn't something you would norma lly celebrate or be really happy about, although I guess it's better than losi ng ten dollars. Most people lose a lot more when they go to places like Las Vegas to  gamble.

But in our story, there's no gambling. There is jus t what Jonas calls “slave labor.” A “slave” (slave) is a person who is owned by anoth er person, who is treated as property, as a thing that you would own. “Slave lab or” would be work done by slaves. Once again, Jonas isn't saying that Crystal  is literally – actually – a slave, but she is working under conditions like a slave. S he is working basically for little or no pay.

Crystal disagrees. She says, “No, it's not!” – it's  not slave labor – “I'm shadowing one of the managers part of the day, and I sit in o n important meetings all the time.” “To shadow” (shadow) here means to follow a person around to see what they do during the day. This is popular in some com panies with some internships. Young college students are allowed to come into the building and follow a boss, follow an executive, around during the day to see what he or she does. They probably don't shadow them to the bathro om . . . I don't think.

 Crystal says she sits in on important meetings. “To  sit in on” means to go to a meeting but not actually be a participant – to go to a meeting or an event but not actually participate in the event. You’re just obse rving. Crystal says that her mentor shows her “how things are done in the busine ss world” and gives her “great career advice.” Her mentor gives her suggest ions about what to do in her future life as an employee or as a worker.

Jonah says, “Well, then you're lucky. Most interns who work for our company learn -squat.” “Diddly (diddly) -squat (squat)” is an old, somewhat funny term meaning little or nothing. “I didn't do diddly-squa t today.” That means I didn't do hardly anything. Don't tell my boss. Jonas says tha t the interns at his company “learn diddly-squat” – that is, nothing – “and spen d their time doing menial work.” “Menial” (menial) is something that is not very imp ortant, that doesn't require very much skill. Jonas says, “Some of them” – some of the interns – “are even unpaid,” meaning they don't receive any money for w orking at the company.

Finally, he says, “What a racket!” The expression “ What a racket” (racket) is used to talk about something that is either illegal or u nethical, something that involves cheating another person, typically. Jonas is saying  that his company is cheating the employees by making them work and do things tha t aren’t very important and not paying them. Crystal says, “In that case, I'm g lad I don't work for your company!” Crystal says if what Jonah says is true a bout his company, she's glad she doesn't work for his company. She's glad that s he's an intern at a different company.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jonas: How’s your new job?

Crystal: It’s not a job exactly. It’s an internship .

Jonas: Oh, so you’re working as somebody’s lackey a nd getting paid a pittance.

Crystal: No, not exactly. I’m doing a lot of scut w ork and I’m not getting paid a lot, but I’m getting very valuable on-the-job experience .

Jonas: Sure you are. You’re learning how to fetch c offee and run errands. Yippee! You don’t have to tell me any more. I know all about it. It’s slave labor.

Crystal: In that case, I’m glad I don’t work for yo ur  company!

[start of dialogue]

Justin: Are you nearly packed?

Marsha: Almost. Let’s see, I have wall chargers for  my cell phone and other devices, extra memory cards for my camera, and nois e-canceling headphones for the airplane.

Justin: Oh, yeah, I forgot to pack my headphones. I ’d better dig them out right now.

Marsha: I’ve also packed portable batteries for our  devices in case we run out of power en route. I’ve also brought a power strip to use in our hotel room.

Justin: Why?

Marsha: Hotel rooms never have enough outlets.

Justin: That’s true. I hadn’t thought of that. Mayb e I should bring one, too. Between the two of us, we have a lot of gadgets to plug in.

Marsha: And I’m bringing some cables in case we wan t to hook up our devices to the TV.

Justin: Don’t you think that’s overkill?

Marsha: Not at all. How else will we entertain ours elves for an entire week?

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins when Justin asks Marsha, “Are y ou nearly packed?” “To be packed” (packed) here means to be ready for a trip,  to be prepared to go somewhere. We also use the word “packed” when somet hing is very crowded. If there are too many people in a small room, we might  say, “It was packed.” Justin asked if Marsha is nearly packed, meaning has she a lmost completed the task of packing. Marsha says, “Almost. Let's see I have wal l chargers for my cell phone and other devices, extra memory cards for my camera , and noise-canceling headphones for the airplane.”

Marsha lists a couple of popular things that you mi ght take with you on a trip. One of them is a “wall charger.” A “wall (wall) cha rger (charger)” is something you plug into the wall, usually with small holes or  a cord that allows you to provide power to a cell phone or some other electro nic device, some other electronic piece of equipment. They’re called “wall  chargers” because you plug them in, or put them into, what are called “outlets ” that are usually found on a wall or in the wall.

An “outlet” (outlet) is a place where electrical wi res have been run and connected to, so you can plug in a power cord or a wall charg er in order to use some sort of electronic piece of equipment. A “memory card” is a  small, flat piece of typically plastic and metal that you put into something like a digital camera, that provides additional digital storage – a place where you can put more digital information, such as a digital photograph.

Marsha is also bringing with her “noise-canceling h eadphones.” “Headphones” refers to something you wear, usually over the top of your head, that has things that go over your ear so that you can hear music, f or example, from an iPod or from a smart phone. When we say the headphones are “noise-canceling,” we mean they have special technology that helps block out noise around you that you probably don't want to hear. “Noise-canceling” means it reduces or tries to eliminate that noise.

Justin says, “Oh yeah, I forgot to pack my headphon es. I'd better dig them out right now.” “To dig (dig) something out” is a two-w ord phrasal verb meaning to take something out of a bag or container, especiall y where there may be a lot of other items that make it a little difficult to find  what you are looking for. “To dig something out” means to go into a place here where something is stored and take it out so you can use it.

Marsha says, “I've also packed portable batteries f or our devices in case we run out of power en route. I've also brought a power st rip to use in our hotel room.” So, Marsha is really prepared here, isn’t she? She’ s bringing portable batteries. When we say something is “portable” (portable), we mean it's easy to carry from one place to another. So, these are small batteries . She's taking them because she wants to be prepared in case they “run out of p ower en route.”

“To run out of” something is to no longer have enou gh of something, usually because you've used it all up. “We’ve run out of mi lk” means we no longer have any milk. We did, but then we drank it. So, now we don't have any more. We've run out. “En route” (en route) – two words – is an expression that means “on the way” or “along the way” while you are going from on e place to another. Sometimes people will pronounce this term “en” rout e instead of “on” route. It's not quite as acceptable, but it's becoming more pop ular and probably is considered acceptable in most circumstances.

Marsha says also that she has brought a power strip  to use in their hotel room. A “power strip” (strip) is a long rectangular device that has different outlets – places you can plug in a cord to get power for your electr onic device. Power strips sometimes, but not always, are also what is called a “surge protector.” They protect your electronic devices in case there is a sudden “surge” (surge) or increase in power. If you have lightning strike the  building where you are, that could cause a power surge that might damage or hurt  your electronic equipment. That's one reason why people use power strips – to prevent that from happening.

Justin asks Marsha why she brought the power strip,  and notice – Marsha doesn't mention anything about protecting their equ ipment. She doesn't mention anything about using the power strip as a surge pro tector. She instead says, “Hotel rooms never have enough outlets.” She wants the power strip so she can plug more things in because the hotel rooms don't u sually have very many outlets in the wall where you can plug things in.

Justin says, “That's true. I hadn't thought of that .” Justin didn't think about that idea. Clearly, Justin is not the smart one here in this marriage. Justin says, “I hadn't thought of that. Maybe I should bring one to o. Between the two of us, we have a lot of gadgets to plug in.” A “gadget” (gadg et) is another word for a small electronic device. An iPhone or mobile phone or a d igital music player – these could all be called gadgets. “To plug in” means to connect a cord, an electrical cord, between your electronic device and the outlet  so that you can get power to the device.

Marsha says, “And I'm bringing some cables in case we want to hook up our devices to the TV.” A “cable” (cable) is an electri c wire, typically covered in plastic, that's used to connect to electronic devic es. If you have an external hard drive for your computer, you would connect it to yo ur main computer with a cable. If you have a television set and a DVD player, you will connect the TV to the DVD player with a cable. Marsha is bringing some cables  “in case we want to hook up our devices to the TV.” “To hook up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning here to connect – to link or connect one thing to another.

Justin says, “Don't you think that's overkill?” The  word “overkill” (overkill) means too much of something, more than what is necessary for a given situation. If the temperature is 60 degrees Fahrenheit, it's probably  overkill to wear a big heavy winter coat. It's just not that cold out. That's mo re than what you need to keep warm. It's overkill. Justin thinks it's overkill for Marsha to bring all of these different things with her on the trip.

Marsha doesn't agree. She says, “Not at all. How el se will we entertain ourselves for an entire week?” We imagine that Justin and Mar sha are going on vacation. Normally vacations are times where you get away fro m some of your electronic devices, but some people, like Justin and Marsha, want to bring everything with them so they will be connected all the time.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Justin: Are you nearly packed?

Marsha: Almost. Let’s see, I have wall chargers for  my cell phone and other devices, extra memory cards for my camera, and nois e-canceling headphones for the airplane.

Justin: Oh, yeah, I forgot to pack my headphones. I ’d better dig them out right now.

Marsha: I’ve also packed portable batteries for our  devices in case we run out of power en route. I’ve also brought a power strip to use in our hotel room.

Justin: Why?

Marsha: Hotel rooms never have enough outlets.

Justin: That’s true. I hadn’t thought of that. Mayb e I should bring one, too. Between the two of us, we have a lot of gadgets to plug in.

Marsha: And I’m bringing some cables in case we wan t to hook up our devices to the TV.

Justin: Don’t you think that’s overkill?

Marsha: Not at all. How else will we entertain ours elves for an entire week?

This episode is a dialogue between Kathy and Brett about designing a building. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kathy: Seeing these blueprints really brings this p roject to life. I can now envision what this building will look like when it’s built.

Brett: I’m really glad. As the architect on this pr oject, it’s my job to turn your ideas into design.

Kathy: You did a great job.

Brett: I had the help of the surveyors and a civil engineer, so I can’t take all of the credit.

Kathy: We’re ready now to solicit bids from general  contractors, don’t you think?

Brett: These plans will give any contractor the spe cifications they need to give a detailed and accurate bid. There’ll be no problems with permits, I don’t think, because a similar structure was on this building si te about 10 years ago before it was torn down.

Kathy: I’m hoping not to run into any stumbling blo cks, but you never know with a building project. I’ll know we’ve cleared the hurdl es when I can bring in the interior designers!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kathy saying to Brett, “Se eing these blueprints really brings this project to life.” “Blueprints” are deta iled drawings of what you need to build a certain building. It's the plan of the buil ding – where the rooms go, where the doors go, and so forth. It's called the “bluepr int” because traditionally it was printed on paper in blue ink. That's why we have the name “blueprint.” The word “blueprint” is used also in a more general way to r efer to the plan of something, especially a detailed plan about how to carry out o r execute a certain task.

Kathy says, “Seeing these blueprints really brings this project to life.” “To bring something to life” means to make it real, to do som ething that allows other people to visualize it, to see how it will look like, and also to believe that it will happen. Kathy says seeing the blueprints “brings this proje ct to life.” She says, “I can now envision what this building will look like when it' s built.” “To envision” (envision) means to imagine something – so much so that you ca n almost see it in your mind. You have a clear picture or a clear idea of w hat something will look like. You can envision things that aren't just physical o bjects. You can envision the success that you might have by completing a certain  task.

Brett says, “I'm really glad” – I'm very happy. “As  the architect on this project, it's my job to turn your ideas into design.” An “archite ct” (architect) is a person who designs buildings, who plans out what the building will look like and makes detailed drawings – plans that the people who are g oing to build the building look at in order to do their job. The architect’s job, a ccording to Brett, is to turn the ideas of the person who wants the building built in to the design. “To turn something into” something else means to transform it, to change it in such a way that it is now this other thing. In this case, we’r e talking about taking ideas and changing them or “turning them into” design. “Desig n” here refers to how something will look or how it will function.

Kathy says, “You did a great job.” Brett responds, “I had the help of the surveyors and a civil engineer, so I can't take all of the cr edit.” A “surveyor” (surveyor) is a person who makes very detailed measurements in orde r to determine where something is located. Usually, a surveyor is used w hen you are going to build a new house or building. The surveyor determines the exact size of the property, often where the property you own begins and where it ends. People sometimes have surveyors come out when, for example, there ma y be some disagreement over where your property ends and where your neighb or’s property begins; a surveyor would help you determine that. Usually, su rveyors produce what are essentially maps of a certain area of land.

Brett also used a civil engineer on this project. A  “civil (civil) engineer” is a person whose job it is to help with the design and the con struction, or building, of things

like bridges, roads, and other similar structures. Brett says that because he got help from these other people, he can't take all of the credit. “To take all of the credit” means to say, “Yes, I deserve the praise th at you are giving me. I deserve all the nice things you are saying about me.” That would be to accept or “to take all of the credit.” Here, Brett says he cannot take  all of the credit because he didn't work on this project alone.

Kathy says, “We’re ready now to solicit bids from g eneral contractors, don't you think?” “To solicit (solicit) bids (bids)” means to  go out and find people who want to do your project and who will give you a price for completing your project. It doesn't have to be a building project. It could be anything that you are hiring someone else to help you complete. It could be a pr oject related to software or computers or almost anything, really, that would re quire you to pay someone else to do work for you. When you solicit bids, you're u sually asking for detailed information and plans about how this person or comp any will complete the task.

A “general contractor” is a person who manages a co nstruction project, sometimes doing some of the work himself, but usual ly bringing in other people – other companies or other workers – to complete some  of the more specialized work. The general contractor will often bring in wh at are called “subcontractors.” These are people who work under the direction of the general contractor in order to finish, for example, the plumbing or the electri cal system in a building.

Brent says these plans will give contractors “the s pecifications they need to give a detailed and accurate bid.” “Specifications” are detailed instructions for following a plan, especially when you are creating something new, as we are here in this building. Specifications will allow the contractors “to give a detailed and accurate bid.” Something that is “accurate” (ac curate) is something that is correct, something that is “exactly correct,” we mi ght say.

Brett also tells Kathy there won't be any “problems  with permits, I don't think.” “Permits” (permits) refers to official permission to do something, usually involved in modifying – changing – or constructing a new bui lding. When you do work on your house, for example – by, I don't know, putting  in a new bathroom – you have to go to the city where you live and get a permit. Basically what you're doing is paying a tax, in a way, to the city so that you can  build something or change something to your current house.

Often, permits require someone from the government – from the city government or local government – to come out and look at or “i nspect” your construction to make sure that everything is being done correctly a nd according to the laws or the “codes” (codes) for building. “Codes” are basic ally regulations that the

government has about how you have to build a house or a building. Brett says he doesn't think there will be any problems with permi ts. This, of course, is what people involved in construction often tell you. “We ll, I don't think there'll be any problems.” They’re not actually promising there won 't be any problems.

Brett says there was a similar structure, or buildi ng, “on this building site about 10 years ago before it was torn down.” A “building sit e” is a place where you are going to build something, a piece of land where you  are going to construct your building. “To tear (tear) down” something is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to destroy something, usually a building – a house or some other structure. Brett says the building was “torn (torn) down.” “Torn” is  the past tense of “tear.”

Kathy says, “I'm hoping not to run into any stumbli ng blocks, but you never know with a building project.” Kathy says she's hoping n ot “to run into” – or to encounter or to have – “any stumbling blocks.” A “s tumbling (stumbling) block” is an obstacle, something that makes progress on a pro ject more difficult. Kathy says, “I’ll know we've cleared the hurdles when I can bring in the interior designers!” The expression “to clear (clear) the hu rdles (hurdles)” means to deal with the difficulties and the challenges and the pr oblems that you have so that you can complete your task.

A “hurdle” here means the same as an obstacle. Lite rally, a “hurdle” is something that you jump over in a race. If you watch the Olym pics, the Summer Olympics, they’ll have a race where the runners have to jump over things. Those things that they jump over are called “hurdles.” “To clear the hurdle” means to jump over it without hitting it – to jump over it successfully. We use that idea of the hurdle to mean more generally to overcome difficulties or pro blems.

Kathy refers to “interior designers.” The “interior ” (interior) of the building is the inside. So, an “interior designer” is the person wh o is responsible for deciding how the inside of the building will look – what col or the walls will be, what kind of furniture will be in the building, and so forth.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kathy: Seeing these blueprints really brings this p roject to life. I can now envision what this building will look like when it’s built.

Brett: I’m really glad. As the architect on this pr oject, it’s my job to turn your ideas into design.

 Kathy: You did a great job.

# Seeing a Circus Performance

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 947 – Seeing a Circus Performance.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 947. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. Go to ESLPod.com and download the one for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue about going to see a cir cus performance, a place where you can see animals and people doing all sort s of interesting tricks. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Ta-da! We’re here. This is your big surprise .

Roman: We’re going to the circus?

Paula: You got it in one! It’s going to be great. T here’ll be clowns and acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.

Roman: I haven’t been to the circus since I was a k id.

Paula: That’s the point. I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for both of us, and let us feel like kids again.

Roman: I’m not sure . . .

Paula: Come on! We’ll miss the first act. I think there’ll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walkers, too.

Roman: Great.

Paula: Listen! I can hear the ringmaster from here.  Let’s go!

Roman: When you said that you had a surprise for me  that would make me feel young again, this wasn’t exactly what I envisioned.

Paula: I know. It’s even better, right?

Roman: If you say so.

[end of dialogue]

Paula begins our dialogue by saying, “Ta-da! We’re here.” That expression, “Ta- da!” (ta da) – two words – is used when you are exc ited and proud to show another person something. You are introducing somet hing to another person – something you're excited about or something, perhap s, you are presenting them as a gift. Paula says, “We’re here. This is your bi g surprise.” So, Paula’s surprise – her gift, if you will – is the place where she ha s taken Roman.

Roman says, “We’re going to the circus?” A “circus”  (circus) is a type of live entertainment where you go and watch people – we wo uld call them “performers” – and trained animals do certain tricks, often thin gs that are dangerous or things that seem unusual. A circus may have lions that do certain tricks. A circus may have someone who is walking on a wire that is suspe nded way up high – what we call, in fact, a “high wire” or a “tightrope.” A ll of these things could be found at a circus, in addition to many other kinds of entert aining performances.

Circuses are popular with children, and many of the  things that you will see at a circus are designed to entertain children. Circuses , at least here in the United States, typically travel from one city or one town to another, and they’ll stay for maybe three or four days, maybe a week or two. When  I was growing up, in the 1970s, back in St. Paul, Minnesota, we would have a  circus that would come to town that would arrive to the city at least once a year and would stay for a couple of weeks. You could go and watch the show, watch the circus performances, in a large auditorium.

Roman asks Paula, “We’re going to the circus?” Paul a says, “You got it in one.” The expression “to get it in one” (one) means to gu ess something correctly the first time – not to need another guess, to get it r ight on the first attempt. Paula says, “It's going to be great. There'll be clowns a nd acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.” Paula lists some of the things you se e, typically, at a circus. We've already mentioned a few of these.

One thing you will always see at a circus is a “clo wn” (clown). A “clown” is a person who dresses in a large outfit, a large unifo rm that's usually very colorful, that has a lot of bright colors. “Clowns” often hav e big red noses on their face and big shoes that they wear. Clowns also often hav e a big wig – fake hair,

basically – that they wear. That's also very colorf ul. Clowns are very popular among small children. They are used to entertain sm all children.

An “acrobat” (acrobat) has nothing to do with your computer or reading PDF files. An “acrobat” is a person who uses their body in an unusual way, similar to a gymnast, but often does things in the air. They do a lot of things that involve jumping or going up high into the air. A “trapeze ( trapeze) artist” is a performer who entertains people by flying through the air, us ually jumping from one bar or one rope to another. “Trapeze artists” do things th at may be very dangerous because they could fall, although usually in a circ us there will be something called a “net” (net) that is put below them to catc h them so they don't hit the floor if they fall.

A “lion (lion) tamer (tamer)” is a person who train s animals – in this case, a lion – to do certain tricks. The word “tamer” comes from the verb “to tame” (tame), which means to take a wild animal and basically cal m it down, make it so that it will not kill anyone or hurt anyone, especially whe n you're talking about a lion. A lion, of course, is a large cat and, like all cats,  can be very dangerous. I recommend staying away from lions and other cats.

Roman says, “I haven't been to the circus since I w as a kid.” A “kid” (kid) is a young child. This, of course, is not unusual. Peopl e go to circuses usually when they are young, when they are young children – unle ss, of course, you're the parent taking a child to the circus. Roman is a lit tle surprised, I guess, that Paula is taking him to a circus. Paula says, however, “Th at's the point.” She’s saying, “Exactly. That's why I'm bringing you here.”

“I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for  both of us, and let us feel like kids again.” The word “nostalgic” (nostalgic) means  being filled with strong emotions, strong feelings, especially when thinking  about something in the past, when reflecting on your memories. When we say somet hing is “nostalgic,” there’s also a sense that we want to go back in time. We wa nt to return to that time when a certain thing was popular or when we experienced a certain positive thing.

Paula wants this trip to the circus to be a nostalg ic one and let her and Roman “feel like kids again” – to feel as though they wer e young children. That’s something I honestly never really want to do, is to  feel like a young child again. I know I had a happy childhood. I'm not saying there was anything bad about when I was growing up, but there were a lot of things th at weren’t very fun about being a child. So, honestly, I’ve never much had a feelin g about wanting to be a kid again. I'd like to be 20 years old again. That's di fferent.

Roman is also expressing some doubts. He says, “I'm  not sure,” meaning “I'm not sure I want to go to the circus.” Paula, howeve r, insists. She says, “Come on!” meaning let's go. “We’ll miss the first act.” An “act” (act) here refers to a part of a performance, a section of a performance. The f irst act would be the first part of some performance. It could be a play. It could b e, as in this example, a circus. She says, “We’ll miss the first act” – if we don't go now, we will miss the first act. That's why she's trying to hurry Roman up.

Then Paula lists some other things you will see at a circus. She says, “I think there'll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walk ers, too.” A “juggler” (juggler) is a person who can keep several objects in the air at  the same time by throwing them up and catching them and throwing them up agai n. A “magician” (magician) is a person who uses what we would call “illusions”  to make you think something is going on even though it really isn't. That’s sor t of what a politician does, I think.

A “tightrope walker” is a person who walks on a hig h wire, or a rope that is very high up in the air. We mentioned this previously. “ Tightrope” (tightrope) is what you call that wire, that rope that the person walks  on. Roman says, “Great.” But he says “great” not to indicate that he's happy, bu t to indicate that he's not very excited about it. He uses the word “great,” but he’ s making a joke. He doesn't think it's great. Paula says, “Listen, I can hear the ringmaster from here. Let's go!” The “ringmaster” (ringmaster) is basically the  leader of the circus, the person who talks to the audience and who directs the perfo rmers to do what they're supposed to do, or at least when they're supposed to do it.

Obviously, Paula is more excited about this than Ro man. Roman says, “When you said you had a surprise for me that would make me feel young again, this wasn't exactly what I envisioned.” It's not what I was thinking about. Paula says, “I know. It's even better, right?” Roman says, “If you say so.” Paula is saying that going to the circus is the best thing that she coul d have given Roman to make him feel young, but Roman doesn't agree.

He ends by saying, “If you say so.” “If you say so”  is a phrase we use when you do not believe or agree with what another person is  saying, but you're willing to pretend it's true because you don't want to argue a bout it. You don't want to fight about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Ta-da! We’re here. This is your big surprise .

 Roman: We’re going to the circus?

Paula: You got it in one! It’s going to be great. T here’ll be clowns and acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.

Roman: I haven’t been to the circus since I was a k id.

Paula: That’s the point. I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for both of us, and let us feel like kids again.

Roman: I’m not sure . . .

Paula: Come on! We’ll miss the first act. I think there’ll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walkers, too.

Roman: Great.

Paula: Listen! I can hear the ringmaster from here.  Let’s go!

Paula: I know. It’s even better, right?

Roman: If you say so.

# Listening to Motivational Speakers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 948 – Listening to Motivational Speakers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 948. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there. Become a membe r of ESL Podcast. When you do, the sun will be brighter, your days wi ll be longer, and your happiness will be greater. Oh, and you can also dow nload a Learning Guide when you become a member.

This episode is an episode about listening to motiv ational speakers – people who try to motivate you or to get you to do something t hat perhaps you don't want to do, like listening to motivational speakers. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jamal: I really dread these annual management meeti ngs. We usually have to sit through the most boring motivational speakers givin g us pep talks.

Cindy: I think you’ll be surprised by the person th ey’ve hired to kick off our meeting. She’s supposed to be a guru on crisis mana gement.

Jamal: Oh no, not another one.

Cindy: This one has a lot of real-world experience.  She was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult mission s.

Jamal: What does a fighter pilot know about busines s? I can’t believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on spe aking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better.

Cindy: I think that the idea is to understand how o ther organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some ligh t on how we can do things better.

Jamal: Well, I don’t have high hopes.

Cindy: Don’t you think she can teach us anything?

 Jamal: Sure, in fact our speaker has inspired me to  try to get on the lecture circuit myself.

Cindy: What would you speak about?

Jamal: Avoiding corporate waste!

[end of dialogue]

Jamal begins our dialogue by saying to Cindy, “I re ally dread these annual management meetings.” “To dread” (dread) means to n ot be excited about something. It's the opposite of “looking forward to ” something. “To dread” something is not to look forward to it. “Management  meetings” are meetings that are attended by, or that have as their participants , people who are managers, executives, bosses in a company. The “management” of a company refers to the people who run the company – the bosses and executi ves.

Jamal says, “We usually have to sit through the mos t boring motivational speakers giving us pep talks.” “To sit through” som ething is a phrasal verb meaning to go somewhere where you have to stay, but  it isn't very pleasant. We might also use the verb, here, “to endure” (endure) . “To endure” or “to sit through” something is to go somewhere and have to l isten to things that you, perhaps, are not very interested in. You might have  to sit through a really bad movie if your husband or wife wants you to go, and you really don't want to go, but you say, “Okay, I’ll go,” and then you have to sit through this terrible movie about people dying and, well, that’s just an exampl e – not something from my own life.

“Pep talks” (pep talks) – two words – are informal speeches that are given to people to make them happier, to make them more moti vated to want to do something. The people who often come to these large  meetings of managers and try to help people get motivated are called “motiva tional speakers.” “Motivational” comes from the verb “to motivate,” which as I've me ntioned means to get you to do something that you perhaps don't otherwise want to do. “Motivational speakers” became very popular in the middle part of  the twentieth century, at least in the United States, especially for these so rts of large business meetings where bosses were coming together to try to plan the future of the company.

Cindy says, “I think you'll be surprised by the per son they've hired to kick off our meeting.” Cindy is not as negative as Jamal is. She ’s saying that he'll be surprised by the person the company hired, or paid,  to come and “kick off our

meeting.” “To kick off” something means to start or  to begin something, especially a long project or a large task that has to be accomplished. Cindy says, “She's supposed to be a guru on crisis management.”  A “guru” (guru) is someone who knows a lot about a certain topic, who is consi dered an expert. A “guru” is also a wise, spiritual person in certain religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. But here, it just means an expert – someo ne who knows a lot about a certain topic.

This motivational speaker knows a lot about crisis management. A “crisis” (crisis) is a serious situation, maybe even a dangerous situ ation, that requires some immediate attention or immediate action. The word “ management” in the term “crisis management” doesn't refer to the people who  run a company, but rather to the process of taking care of and solving whatever problem is causing, in this case, a crisis. Jamal says, “Oh no, not another one .” He still isn't very happy about this motivational speaker.

Cindy says, “This one” – this speaker – “has a lot of real-world experience.” The term “real- (real) world (world)” refers to things that people actually do – that people do “in real life,” we might say. The term is  used to contrast with learning or experience that comes from reading, or comes fro m not actually participating in a certain activity, but perhaps from simply obse rving it. You can learn things from books, and you can learn things from “real-lif e experiences” or “real-world experiences” – things that you actually have experi enced or participated in yourself. Cindy says that the motivational speaker “was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult missions.”

A “pilot” (pilot) is a person who flies a plane; a “fighter pilot” would be someone in the military who flies planes that shoot bullets or  drop bombs in some sort of military activity – a war, for example. This motiva tional speaker “was a fighter pilot who apparently survived some very difficult m issions.” A “mission” (mission), when referring to military activities, is a task th at has to be accomplished. For a fighter pilot, a mission might involve flying a hun dred miles and dropping a bomb and then coming back to the ship or the place where  the plane took off from. That might be a mission. The word “mission” can also mea n, more generally, the purpose for doing something – your reason for doing  something.

Jamal says, “What does a fighter pilot know about b usiness? I can't believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on spe aking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better.” Jamal is  not happy. He says he can't believe that the company “is shelling out thousands  of dollars.” “To shell (shell) out” money means to pay a lot of money for somethin g. This is a two-word phrasal verb that is often used when you think the money is being wasted, when

you think the price is too high. “I don't want to s hell out $50,000 for a new car. That's too much money.” “Speaking fees” refer to the money that you have to pay someone to come in and give a talk or a speech to y our group.

So, Jamal is not happy the company is spending, or shelling out, “thousands of dollars on speaking fees.” Cindy says, “I think tha t the idea is to understand how other organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some light on how we can do things better.” Cindy is saying that although this woman may not know anything about business, she understands how to handle or manage a crisis. And “crises” happen in many different situa tions and in many different organizations.

Cindy says that the fighter pilot’s experience migh t shed some light on how they do things in their company. “To shed (shed) light o n” something or “to shed some light on” something means to provide insight on a t opic, to help someone understand something better, to see it in a differe nt way. Jamal says, “Well, I don't have high hopes.” “High hopes” are high expec tations – when you think something is going to be really great. Jamal does n ot have high hopes.

Cindy says, “Don't you think she can teach us anyth ing?” Jamal says, “Sure. In fact, our speaker has inspired me to try to get on the lecture circuit myself.” Jamal is saying that this woman is inspiring him or  giving him the idea – and, I guess, the motivation – to try to get on the lectur e circuit. The term “lecture” (lecture) refers to a speech when you go out and ed ucate someone or give a speech to a group of people to try to provide new i nformation to them. We also use this word at the university when a professor gi ves information to the students. We call that “giving a lecture,” or we ca n use it as a verb: “to lecture.”

The “lecture circuit” (circuit) refers to a typical  schedule that you would have for a person who goes and gives lectures or presentations  at many different places, in many different organizations. In education, for exa mple, there are people who go around and give presentations to teachers in differ ent cities. Now, they don't all go to the same cities or to the same schools, but w e could refer to this activity of going around and giving presentations and talks to different groups of people in different parts of the country as being a “lecture circuit.”

I was on the lecture circuit for a couple of years.  I would go around and give speeches and give presentations to English teachers  all around the United States. I did that for about three years. I would f ly to different cities and give presentations, sometimes 30 or 40 cities in a year.  So, I did a lot of traveling when I was younger. I'm glad I don't have to do tha t anymore. I travel now just via the Internet.

 To finish our dialogue, Cindy says, “What would you  speak about?” She's asking Jamal what he would go and present on if he were to  be on the lecture circuit. Jamal says, “Avoiding corporate waste.” “Corporate”  (corporate) refers to a large company. “Waste” (waste) refers to money that is no t spent well, money that is lost on things that are not very productive or usef ul. “Corporate waste” will refer to money that a company spends that doesn't really give them very much benefit.

Jamal thinks motivational speakers are a waste of m oney. So, he's going to go around to other companies as a motivational speaker  to tell them how much money they're wasting on motivational speakers.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jamal: I really dread these annual management meeti ngs. We usually have to sit through the most boring motivational speakers givin g us pep talks.

Cindy: I think you’ll be surprised by the person th ey’ve hired to kick off our meeting. She’s supposed to be a guru on crisis mana gement.

Jamal: Oh no, not another one.

Cindy: This one has a lot of real-world experience.  She was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult mission s.

Jamal: What does a fighter pilot know about busines s? I can’t believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on spe aking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better.

Cindy: I think that the idea is to understand how o ther organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some ligh t on how we can do things better.

Jamal: Well, I don’t have high hopes.

Cindy: Don’t you think she can teach us anything?

Jamal: Sure, in fact our speaker has inspired me to  try to get on the lecture circuit myself.

 Cindy: What would you speak about?

Jamal: Avoiding corporate waste!

This episode is a dialogue about contagious disease s – diseases or illnesses that can spread from one person to another. Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Isabelle: You can’t walk through that door with all  of your clothes on!

Linus: What?! I’ve just come off of a 12-hour fligh t. I’m tired and I want to get into my own house and into my own bed.

Isabelle: I know, but you’ve just returned from McQ uillanland, and I’ve just read that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease called Niebola. It can be transmitted through casua l contact, so even if you don’t have it, you could spread it.

Linus: So what am I supposed to do? Stand out here for the rest of my life?

Isabelle: Of course not. Take off your clothes.

Linus: You want me to take off my clothes in front of the house? Are you crazy?!

Isabelle: No, the best way to prevent the spread of  this infectious disease is to burn clothing that has been in contact with it, and  to bathe you thoroughly.

Linus: I’m not stripping down to my underwear out h ere.

Isabelle: But aren’t you worried about transmitting  Niebola to me and everyone you know? No one is immune. You could start an epid emic!

Linus: All right, but I’m going around to the back door where no one can see me, okay?

Isabelle: Great! I’ll get your bath ready. I just h ave to heat the mayonnaise.

Linus: What?! You want me to take a bath in mayonna ise?

Isabelle: That’s the only way to kill Niebola.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Isabel saying to Linus, “You can’t walk through that door with all of your clothes on!” Linus says, “Wha t?! I've just come off of a 12- hour flight. I'm tired and I want to get into my ow n house and into my own bed.” So, we have a situation where Linus is coming off of a plane. He says, “I've just come off of a 12-hour flight,” which means he was o n a plane for 12 hours. He got off the plane and went home, but Isabel, who we  guess to be his wife, is not letting him into the house.

Isabel says, “I know” – I understand you want to ge t into your house – “but you’ve just returned from McQuillanland, and I've just rea d that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease ca lled Niebola. It can be transmitted through casual contact, so even if you don't have it, you could spread it.” We learn that Linus has gone to what I think s ounds like a wonderful place, McQuillanland, and unfortunately has perhaps become  a carrier of a communicable disease.

A “carrier” (carrier) is a person who has a certain  disease, but doesn't show any symptoms. It doesn't look like the person has any d isease. However, because they have the disease, they could give it to other people. We’re talking here about diseases or illnesses that are communicable. The term “communicable” (communicable) refers to things that can be transmi tted or shared or given to other people from one person to another. A disease such as “chicken pox” can be “communicated,” or transmitted, from one person to another. That makes it a communicable disease.

This “communicable disease” is called Niebola. Isab el says, “It can be transmitted through casual contact, so even if you don't have it, you could spread it.” “Transmit” here means to share, to pass from o ne person to another. We use the verb “transmit” in this sense when we’re talkin g about things like communicable diseases. We also use it in biology to  talk about genetic traits or characteristics that are passed from parents to the ir children.

 The term “casual contact” refers to you talking to someone, and not perhaps touching someone, but only for a very short amount of time. However, there are certain diseases that, even with casual contact, ev en though you don't have a lot of contact with that person – you're not talking to  them or being with them for very long time – can still end up being a way of catchin g or getting a disease. Some diseases can be transmitted through casual contact.  Many cannot. Many require some more “extensive,” we might say, contact with a  person who has that disease.

Isabel says that even if Linus doesn't feel any of the effects of the disease, he could still spread it. “To spread (spread)” means to distribute something, to move something around so that it covers a larger area or , in this case, affects more people. If you are spreading disease, you are in a way helping other people get this disease. You are doing something that is going  to increase the likelihood of other people getting the disease.

Linus says, “So what am I supposed to do? Stand out  here for the rest of my life?” He's confused about what he has to do in ord er to get into his own house. Isabel says, “Of course not. Take off your clothes”  – remove your clothing. Linus says, “You want me to take off my clothes in front of the house? Are you crazy?!” Isabel says, “No, the best way to prevent the sprea d of this infectious disease is to burn clothing that has been in contact with it, and to bathe you thoroughly.” So, this is something of an odd disease that apparently  can be transmitted through someone's clothing.

Isabel says the best way to prevent the spread of t his infectious disease is to burn clothing. “To prevent” means to not allow some thing to happen, to not permit something to happen. An “infectious (infecti ous) disease” is a disease that can be caused when some organism – some living orga nism such as bacteria or a virus or fungus – enters the body. Isabel says th at Niebola can be prevented, or at least we can prevent the spread of this infec tious disease, by burning clothing that has been in contact with it. “To burn ” means to put something in a fire, to destroy something by fire.

“To be in contact with” something is to have touche d something or to have touched someone. Isabel wants to burn Linus’s cloth ing in case it has been in contact with this disease. She also wants to bathe Linus. “To bathe” (bathe) means to wash someone, typically in a large contain er which we call a “tub” (tub). You put water in the tub and then you take the wate r and you use it to clean a person off – or to clean your dog off, I suppose.

Linus is not happy about this situation. He says, “ I'm not stripping down to my underwear out here.” “To strip (strip) down to” som ething here usually means to remove your clothing, to get undressed. Linus doesn 't want to strip down to his underwear, meaning to take off all of his clothes e xcept his underwear. “Underwear” just refers to clothing that you wear u nderneath other clothing – typically, that you don't want people to see. “Unde rwear” protects your clothing from touching directly to certain parts of your bod y. Let’s put it that way.

Isabel says, “But aren't you worried about transmit ting Niebola to me and everyone you know? No one is immune.” “To be immune ” (immune), when we’re talking about a disease, means that you cannot get a disease. Maybe the biological makeup or composition of your body is su ch that you can't get a disease. It might also be that you have received a vaccination – that you've taken a pill or received a shot that prevents you from ge tting the disease. Isabel says that “no one is immune” to Niebola.

She says to Linus, “You could start an epidemic!” A n “epidemic” (epidemic) is a situation in which a disease affects many people in  a particular area. It spreads. It is transmitted to many different people. Linus s ays, “All right, but I’m going around to the back door where no one can see me, ok ay?” Linus wants to go to the back of the house so that he doesn't have to un dress in front of the house.

Isabel is happy. She says, “Great. I'll get your ba th ready. I just have to heat the mayonnaise.” “Mayonnaise” is a white sauce – made f rom eggs, vinegar, lemon juice, and other things – that is often used on bre ad or in preparing food. It is not something we would usually associate with medicine.  Linus says, “What?! You want me to take a bath in mayonnaise?” Isabel says,  “That's the only way to kill Niebola.” So, Niebola is a very strange disease. Bu t McQuillanland is a very strange country.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Isabelle: You can’t walk through that door with all  of your clothes on!

Linus: What?! I’ve just come off of a 12-hour fligh t. I’m tired and I want to get into my own house and into my own bed.

Isabelle: I know, but you’ve just returned from McQ uillanland, and I’ve just read that anyone who has been there may be a carrier of a communicable disease

called Niebola. It can be transmitted through casua l contact, so even if you don’t have it, you could spread it.

Linus: So what am I supposed to do? Stand out here for the rest of my life?

Isabelle: Of course not. Take off your clothes.

# Visiting a Construction Site

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 950 – Visiting a Construction Site.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 950. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there. Become a membe r of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue about someone going to visit a place where they are build ing a building. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bill: Ma’am! Ma’am!

Estelle: Yes?

Bill: Ma’am, you’re not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you’re not allowed. Please don’t step on that scaffolding.  It’s dangerous.

Estelle: Oh, I just wanted a quick look to see how the building is coming along. Look at all this lumber and brick. The foundation is already done and the beams and rafters are going up. This is so exciting!

Bill: Ma’am, this is a dangerous area, especially f or someone not wearing a hard hat.

Estelle: I won’t stay very long. I just wanted to s ee the progress.

Bill: Watch out!

Estelle: Oh, I almost tripped over these pickaxes a nd shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.

Bill: You’re welcome. Now let me escort you off the  site.

Estelle: But I wanted to see that bulldozer and cra ne over there.

Bill: You can see them just fine from the street. A nd from the street you won’t be my responsibility!

[end of dialogue]

Bill begins our dialogue by shouting to Estelle, “M a’am! Ma’am!” The expression “Ma'am” (Ma’am) is a way of getting the attention of a woman, an adult woman. It's not as common anymore, though you may still he ar it in certain formal circumstances, especially when you don't know the w oman very well. Bill doesn't know Estelle at all, and that's why he is addressin g her or referring to her as “Ma'am.” He's trying to get her attention.

In this case, Estelle says, “Yes?” Bill then says, “Ma’am, you're not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you're not  allowed.” A “construction site” is a place where they are building a new building. It could be a house. It could be an office building. It could be any kind of structu re. Bill says that Estelle is not allowed, meaning she is not supposed to be there.

He then says, “Please don't step on” – or put your foot on – “that scaffolding.” “Scaffolding” (scaffolding) is a temporary structur e that is made typically from metal and wood that is used to help the people buil ding the building get up to a higher level. You can almost think of it as a ladde r, but a ladder is something that just leans up against something. It doesn't stand b y itself. “Scaffolding” stands by itself and is used to allow the workers to go up to  a higher level, especially when they're building a house or building that is more t han one level – more than one “floor,” we might say.

Estelle says, “Oh, I just wanted a quick look to se e how the building is coming along.” “To come along” is a phrasal verb meaning to advance, to progress, to move forward. “How are you coming along on your hom ework?” a parent might ask a child. That means “How are you progressing? H ow are you doing? How much progress have you made?” Estelle wanted to see  how the building was coming along.

She then says, “Look at all this lumber and brick.”  “Look at all this” means look at this – look at all of what I am pointing to. In this case, Estelle is pointing to “lumber” (lumber) and “brick” (brick). “Lumber” is wood that has been cut to a specific size in order to use it to build something . If you are building a house or a building and you are making it out of wood, at leas t in part, you will need lumber. These pieces of wood are often referred to by their  sizes – by the height and width of the wood. You may hear someone talk about a “two by four.” That's a piece of wood in the shape of a rectangle, two inch es by four inches.

 “Brick” (brick) are small rectangular blocks. Often  they are a dark red color. They are typically made from clay and are used to build walls and other parts of the house. In the old days, many years ago, in certain parts of the U.S. you would see a lot of brick buildings. Nowadays it's not as common, probably because wood is cheaper and easier to work with. But you wi ll still see some parts of houses that use brick.

Estelle says, “The foundation is already done” – is  already finished or completed – “and the beams and rafters are going up.” “This is so exciting!” she says. The “foundation” (foundation) is the part of the buildi ng that touches the ground. It's the first thing you have to put in if you are going  to build a building. It's what you build the building on top of. You don't just put the pieces of wood into the dirt. You first, especially if you are building a house o r a large building, have to lay a foundation.

Notice we use the verb “to lay” (lay). “To lay a fo undation” means to put usually concrete or some sort of stone on the ground, and u sually underneath the ground, to support the house, to support the weight  of the house. “Beams” (beams) are long, straight pieces of wood or metal that are used to support the wall or the roof of a building. “Rafters” (rafters)  refer to one of several long pieces of wood that are placed at an angle on top of the w alls to support the roof above. So, the rafters help support the top of the house o r the building, which we call the “roof” (roof).

Bill says, “Ma'am, this is a dangerous area, especi ally for someone not wearing a hard hat.” A “hard hat” is just what it sounds like  – a hat that you wear that's large and heavy that protects your head in case something  heavy falls on your head. Of course, if a 16-ton weight falls on you, even a hard hat will not protect you, but it will protect you from smaller things falling on you. Estelle says, “I won't stay very long” – I won't remain here very long. “I just  wanted to see the progress.”

Bill then yells, “Watch out!” “Watch out” is a phra sal verb meaning be careful. It's used to warn someone about some danger, something t hat might hurt them. If you say, “Watch out,” you mean that that person mig ht get hit with something within the next second or five seconds. So, it's a way of warning someone that there is some danger. You could also say “watch out ” if someone is walking and doesn't see a hole that is in front of them and mig ht hurt themselves by falling down into the hole. That would also be a case of sa ying, “Watch out!”

In general conversation, people say “watch out” as a way of saying you need to be careful about this person or you need to be care ful about this situation. It's not

necessarily a case of you being in physical danger,  but you might have problems in other areas. And so, we might use that expressio n “watch out” in that case as well. Estelle says, “Oh, I almost tripped over” – o r fell over – “these pickaxes and shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.”

A “pickaxe” (pickaxe) is a large, heavy tool with a  wooden handle – the handle is what you grab onto with your hands – and a large pi ece of metal at the other end. This large piece of metal has two sharp ends on it.  The tool is used to make a hole in something very heavy, like a piece of rock or some part of the earth, the ground. A “shovel” (shovel) is a tool that also has  a long wooden handle, but at the end has a slightly curved piece of metal that is used to go into the ground – to dig into the ground – and remove dirt or remove wha tever you are trying to get out of the way. A “shovel” is used very often in or der to dig a hole.

A “wheelbarrow” (wheelbarrow) – one word – is basic ally a little car or cart. It typically has just one wheel on the front. On the b ack are two legs made of wood or metal that you can rest on. But basically you pu sh it on one wheel.  It's used to carry heavy objects, or a lot of stone, or a lot of  earth that needs to be moved from one place to another. When I say it is used to  move those things, I mean it's used to move them a short distance. If you are goin g to move something a long distance, you wouldn't use a wheelbarrow. You'd pro bably use a truck. A wheelbarrow is small. It won't contain that much ma terial, anyway.

Bill says, “You're welcome” after Estelle thanks hi m for saving her. He says, “Now let me escort you off the site.” “To escort” ( escort) someone means to take someone somewhere, to accompany someone to a place.  In this case, Bill wants to escort Estelle off the construction site. He wan ts to take her away from the construction site so she doesn't get hurt.

Estelle says, “But I wanted to see that bulldozer a nd crane over there.” A “bulldozer” (bulldozer) is a large vehicle that has  a piece of metal connected to it that can be raised and lowered. It's often used to push or move a large amount of dirt or rocks. A “crane” (crane) is also a large ma chine used to move heavy objects, but a crane is a very tall machine that pi cks things up and moves them distances. Cranes can often be very tall. Cranes are used to move large parts of a building as it is being constructed or perhaps as  it is being torn down, as it is being taken apart.

Bill says, “You can see [the bulldozer and the cran e] just fine from the street. And from the street, you won't be my responsibility!” B ill means that if Estelle leaves the construction site, then he doesn't have to worr y about her.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bill: Ma’am! Ma’am!

Estelle: Yes?

Bill: Ma’am, you’re not supposed to be here. This is a construction site and you’re not allowed. Please don’t step on that scaffolding.  It’s dangerous.

Estelle: Oh, I just wanted a quick look to see how the building is coming along. Look at all this lumber and brick. The foundation is already done and the beams and rafters are going up. This is so exciting!

Bill: Ma’am, this is a dangerous area, especially f or someone not wearing a hard hat.

Estelle: I won’t stay very long. I just wanted to s ee the progress.

Bill: Watch out!

Estelle: Oh, I almost tripped over these pickaxes a nd shovels and landed in the wheelbarrow. Thank you for saving me.

Bill: You’re welcome. Now let me escort you off the  site.

Estelle: But I wanted to see that bulldozer and cra ne over there.

Bill: You can see them just fine from the street. A nd from the street you won’t be my responsibility!

This episode is a dialogue that takes place at a ho spital about the parts of a hospital. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jordan: Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into the hospital about two hours ago, but I can’t find her.

Admissions Clerk: Why was she brought into the hosp ital?

Jordan: I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworke r, but she didn’t give me any details.

Admissions Clerk: If it weren’t an accident, then s he wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.

Jordan: It may have been her heart. She has a heart  condition.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the cardiolo gy department. If she is in severe condition, she’ll be in the ICU.

Jordan: It may also be the baby. She’s pregnant.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the obstetri cs and gynecology department. And if the baby has been born, it would  be in the neonatal unit.

Jordan: I’m just not sure where to go. Maybe I’ll s tart in the cardiology department.

Admissions Clerk: That’s fine. Go past the neurolog y and oncology departments and it’s on your right. If you see the burn unit, then you’ve gone too far.

Jordan: You can’t look her up for me to see if she’ s been admitted?

Admissions Clerk: I’m sorry, but our computer syste ms are down right now. If you wait until they’re up again, I can try to find her for you.

Jordan: And go out of my mind worrying? No thanks. I’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins by Jordan saying to an employee  of the hospital, “Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into the hospital abo ut two hours ago, but I can’t find her.” Jordan is speaking to the admissions cle rk. If you are “admitted” to a hospital, that means that you are formally register ed, usually to stay overnight or to stay for a longer period in the hospital. The pe rson who takes care of the paperwork – of getting your information, your insur ance documents, and so forth – is called the “admissions clerk.” The word “admis sions” comes from the verb “to admit” – to let into.

The admissions clerk says, “Why was she brought int o the hospital?” Jordan says, “I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworker , but she didn’t give me any details.” The admission’s clerk says, “If it weren’ t an accident, then she wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.” The e mergency room in a hospital – sometimes called the “ER,” by its initials – is the part of the hospital that treats or takes care of people who have very serious or da ngerous medical problems that need to be treated right away.

If you break your leg or you have a cut in your arm  and it’s bleeding, you would go to the emergency room. You can’t wait to make an  appointment to go see your doctor next week; you have to go right now. A “trauma (trauma) unit” is a part of a hospital that takes care of people who ha ve injuries like a broken leg, but not illnesses like influenza or some other dise ase. Trauma units take care of people who have had accidents – physical injuries t hat usually result from some activity such as playing sports or driving a car an d getting in a car accident, that sort of thing.

Jordan says, “It may have been her heart. She has a  heart condition.” A “heart condition” is when you have some problem with your heart, some problem that might be serious enough for you to go to go to a ho spital, for example. People

who have heart conditions can have a lot of differe nt things wrong with the heart. It’s just a general term. The admissions clerk then  says, “Then she might be in the cardiology department.” “Cardiology” (cardiolog y) is an area of medicine that deals with the heart. It’s the area of medicine tha t is concerned with the heart.

The clerk says, “If she is in severe condition, she ’ll be in the ICU.” The “ICU” is the “intensive care unit.” The word “unit” in a hos pital just means the section or area. Intensive care is when someone is very sick, perhaps even close to dying, and so you need someone to be watching over them, to be looking after them, 24 hours a day. The intensive care unit is where peopl e go with all sorts of different kinds of illnesses and problems, but who are all in  danger of dying, really.

Jordan says, “It may also be the baby. She’s pregna nt.” “To be pregnant” (pregnant) means you are expecting a baby. You are expecting a child. The situation in this dialogue, as in other dialogues, is meant to reflect the changes that have taken place, in some cases, in the U.S. T hese are situations that are not necessarily the same as in other countries or, for that matter, even a few years ago here in the U.S. It has become common in past 20 years for a larger percentage of women to get pregnant before they get  married and even have children before they are married.

The admissions clerk says, “Then she might be in the obstetrics and gynecology department.” “Obstetrics” (obstetrics) is the area of medicine related to childbirth, to the care of women who are pregnant and are havin g a baby. “Gynecology” (gynecology) is the area of medicine that deals wit h illnesses and diseases affecting girls and women – affecting females. A ma n would not go to a gynecology department . . . unless you were the doc tor in the gynecology department. If you need more explanations about thi s, you can talk to your own doctor, or maybe your parents.

The admissions clerk says, “If the baby has been bo rn” – and of course, one would think Jordan would know if that were about to  happen – “it would be in the neonatal unit.” “Neonatal” (neonatal) is the part of the hospital that takes care of babies who have been born very recently, usually wi thin, say, 24 hours of the birth. Jordan, who is quite clearly a confused pers on at this point, says, “I’m not sure where to go.” Of course, it seems unlikely tha t the girlfriend wouldn’t have a telephone – a cell phone – nowadays, but well, Jord an apparently doesn’t think of that.

He says, “Maybe I’ll start in the cardiology depart ment.” The admissions clerk says, “That’s fine” – okay – “Go past the neurology  and oncology departments and it’s on your right.” The “neurology (neurology)  department” is the part of the

hospital that takes care of people who have problem s with their brain and what is called the “nervous system.” The “nervous system” is the way that the body communicates messages, or the brain communicates me ssages, to the rest of the body, you could say. So, if you have problems w ith your brain, like my neighbor, then you might be in the neurology depart ment.

There’s also a part of the hospital called an “onco logy (oncology) department.” An “oncology department” takes care of people who h ave cancer. The admissions clerk says, “If you see the burn unit, then you’ve gone too far.” In other words, if you are walking down the hallway of  the hospital, and you see something called the “burn unit,” you’ve walked too  far. You have to turn around and go back. The “burn (burn) unit” is the part of the hospital that treats people who have been burned by fire or some other hot obje ct.

Jordan says, “You can’t look her up for me to see i f she’s been admitted?” Jordan is asking the admissions clerk if she can gi ve him that information by looking it up. “To look someone up” is a phrasal ve rb meaning to search for that person – usually, nowadays, in a database that is i n a computer. “To be admitted,” as we mentioned earlier, means to be for mally taken into and registered at a hospital. Jordan wants to know if the admissions clerk can just look up the information for him.

That isn’t always possible, especially if you’re no t a family member. In fact, in many hospitals there are strict rules about the kin d of information you can get by talking to the admissions office, but that doesn’t seem to be the problem here. The admissions clerk says, “I’m sorry, but our comp uter systems are down right now.” When we say the “computer systems are down,” we mean the computer isn’t working again. She says, “If you wait until they’re up again, I can try to find her for you” – if you wait until the computer syste ms are working, then the admissions clerk says she can try to find the girlf riend for Jordan.

Jordan says, “And go out of my mind worrying?” “To go out of your mind” means to go crazy, to become irrational – usually because  you’re very worried or anxious about something. Jordan says, “No thanks. I ’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan.” A “bedpan” (bedp an) – one word – is a small container that is used for people basically to do w hat they would normally do in a bathroom. But if they can’t get out of their bed, they need somewhere “to go,” we would say informally. That is what a bedpan is.

What Jordan is really saying is that he’s going to look everywhere to find her, instead of just waiting for the computer system to come back up.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jordan: Excuse me, my girlfriend was brought into the hospital about two hours ago, but I can’t find her.

Admissions Clerk: Why was she bought into the hospi tal?

Jordan: I’m not sure. I got a call from her coworke r, but she didn’t give me any details.

Admissions Clerk: If it weren’t an accident, then s he wouldn’t be in the emergency room or the trauma unit.

Jordan: It may have been her heart. She has a heart  condition.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the cardiolo gy department. If she is in severe condition, she’ll be in the ICU.

Jordan: It may also be the baby. She’s pregnant.

Admissions Clerk: Then she might be in the obstetri cs and gynecology department. And if the baby has been born, it would  be in the neonatal unit.

Jordan: I’m just not sure where to go. Maybe I’ll s tart in the cardiology department.

Admissions Clerk: That’s fine. Go past the neurolog y and oncology departments and it’s on your right. If you see the burn unit, then you’ve gone too far.

Jordan: You can’t look her up for me to see if she’ s been admitted?

Admissions Clerk: I’m sorry, but our computer syste ms are down right now. If you wait until they’re up again, I can try to find her for you.

Jordan: And go out of my mind worrying? No thanks. I’m going to find her, even if I have to look behind every bedpan!

It's a business-related episode about the increasing cost of making things in a business. Let’s get started.   [start of dialogue]  Giovanni: There are no two ways about it. We have to raise prices.  Melanie: We can’t. We already raised prices earlier this year. Doing it again risks alienating our customers.  Giovanni: What else can we do? Our production costs have risen nearly 15 percent. We’ve tried absorbing them and offsetting them, but nothing has worked. Our profit margin continues to shrink and we don’t have any other choice.  Melanie: What about lowering the quality of our raw materials? We could use a cheaper supplier.  Giovanni: That’s a sure way to lose customers. If we start cutting corners on quality, our customers will leave in droves.  Melanie: What if we discontinue manufacturing some of the less popular items? That should save us some money.  Giovanni: Not enough. We either raise prices or stop production altogether.   Melanie: There is one other option.  Giovanni: What? # Living With Insects and Spiders

This episode is a dialogue about insects and spider s – sounds kind of scary. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Judith: Ahh! Get it off me!

Murad: It’s just a tiny spider. Don’t freak out.

Judith: I hate spiders. What is this place you’ve b rought me to?

Murad: It’s one of the most beautiful spots in the world, and we’ll be staying here tonight.

Judith: You mean we’ll be roughing it in this cabin ? Is that a cockroach that just ran across the floor?

Murad: Maybe. In this place, you’ll see some of the  most amazing things. It’s the next best thing to sleeping in the open.

Judith: Great. Can you close that window? There are  flies and moths everywhere, and I think those were bees and wasps j ust outside the door.

Murad: They won’t bother you if you don’t bother th em. Listen to that! We can fall asleep to the sound of crickets.

Judith: Ouch! I think I’ve just been bitten by a gi ant mosquito.

Murad: You’re imagining things. Look at those butte rflies just outside the window. Don’t you think they’re beautiful?

 Judith: Do you know what would look beautiful to me  right now? A really big mosquito net!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Judith saying, or rather s creaming, “Ahh! Get it off me!” She is telling Murad to remove something from her, probably something that has started to crawl on her – that is, has started to m ove across her body or her clothing. Murad says, “It's just a tiny spider.” A “spider” (spider) is a kind of animal called an “arachnid” (arachnid). It's a small anima l that has eight legs. It's a little difficult to describe a spider. If you’ve seen the movie Spiderman , then you know what a spider is.

Murad says this animal is just a tiny, or small, sp ider. He tells Judith, “Don't freak out.” The verb “to freak (freak) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to lose control of your words and actions, usually because you're very  frightened or possibly angry. Judith says, “I hate spiders. What is this place yo u’ve brought me to?” She's asking Murad where are they that they would have th ese spiders. Murad says, “It's one of the most beautiful spots,” or places, “in the world, and we’ll be staying here tonight.”

Judith says, “You mean will be roughing it in this cabin?” “To rough (rough) it” means to live, usually for short amount of time, un der more difficult circumstances, often away from a house or a buildin g – to live outside, often without electricity, for example, or Wi-Fi. That wo uld be “to rough it.” “To rough it” is often used when describing people who go camping  – who go out into the forest or out into the desert or out into a park, a nd they sleep on the ground outside, and they make their food outside, and so f orth. That's what I've been told. I'm not really much of a camper.

Judith and Murad are not camping, exactly. They're staying in a “cabin” (cabin). A “cabin” is a small building, usually just one room.  It's like a very small house in the forest, or in a park, or by a lake. Usually, ca bins are found out away from the city, away from the large towns, and are often used  for vacation purposes. Some cabins are as nice as some small houses. Judith doe sn't think this cabin is very nice. That's why she uses the expression “roughing it.”

She then asks Murad, “Is that a cockroach that just  ran across the floor?” A “cockroach” (cockroach) is a large brown insect, a small little animal that is often associated with places that are dirty, that aren’t clean. Murad says, “Maybe,” meaning maybe that was a cockroach. He says, “In th is place, you'll see some of

the most amazing things. It's the next best thing to sleeping in the open.” The expression “next best thing to” means almost as goo d as, nearly as good as. Murad says, “It's nearly as good as sleeping in the  open.” “In the open” here means outdoors – outside of a house or building.

Judith says, “Great,” but she of course is not real ly happy. Normally, when someone says, “Great,” they're happy. But when you say it the way Judith says it, you're being sarcastic. You’re making a joke. You m ean the opposite: it's not great. Judith says, “Can you close that window? The re are flies and moths everywhere.” A “fly” (fly) is a small, typically bl ack insect that flies. It is often attracted to garbage, at least in a city. A “moth” (moth) is also a flying insect. It's usually white, gray, or brown and has very large wi ngs. It is known to be attracted to light. At nighttime, for example, if you live in  an area that has moths, you may see them flying close to a lightbulb. They’re attra cted to the light at night, at least the ones that are near my house.

Judith says, “I think those were bees and wasps jus t outside the door.” A “bee” (bee) is also a flying insect. It has yellow and bl ack stripes typically, and is somewhat dangerous, or can be dangerous. A “bee” ca n actually – not exactly bite you, but the verb we would use is “sting” (sti ng) you. Not Sting, the British singer. “Sting” here, as a verb, means to put a sma ll part of the bee’s body into your skin.

A “wasp” (wasp) is a long, thin flying insect that also has yellow and black stripes. It tends to build large, what we would call “nests”  (nests). We sometimes get wasp nests in our house where I live. You have to b uy something at the store in order to get rid of them – to spray the wasp nest to kill and get rid of the wasps. Murad says, “They” – meaning the flies, moths, bees , and wasps – “won't bother you if you don't bother them.”

Then he says, “Listen to that! We can fall asleep to the sound of crickets.” A “cricket” (cricket) is an insect that is similar to  a grasshopper. It makes a very distinctive sound, usually around the time the sun is setting. I remember growing up in Minnesota, when we would go up away from the city. You could always hear, in the summertime, crickets at night, or at the time that the sun was setting. “Cricket” is also the word we use to describe the g ame that is popular in Great Britain and in other countries that at one time wer e associated with Great Britain.

Judith says “Ouch!” “Ouch” is the word we use when something hurts us suddenly. She says, “I think I've just been bitten by a giant mosquito.” “To be bitten” means the mosquito has done something to pu ncture, or to make a hole in, your skin. A “mosquito” (mosquito) is another s mall flying insect that is

associated usually with wet areas and is often very  active when the sun is rising – when the sun is coming up – and when the sun is g oing down. The mosquito bites you and apparently feeds on your blood like a  vampire, except vampires aren’t real, even though they're very popular on te levision and in the movies. Some people say my neighbor is a vampire, but I don 't think so.

Judith is worried about a mosquito biting her, but Murad says, “You're imagining things” – you’re thinking things are true that aren 't really true. He says, “Look at those butterflies just outside the window. Don't yo u think they’re beautiful?” A “butterfly” (butterfly) is a flying insect that usu ally has very colorful wings. “Butterflies” feed off of flowers, as do other inse cts. Judith says, “Do you know what would look beautiful to me right now? A really  big mosquito net!” A “mosquito net” (net) is something that you put over  a door or a window or a bed that keeps the insects away from people, especially  when they're sleeping.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Judith: Ahh! Get it off me!

Murad: It’s just a tiny spider. Don’t freak out.

# Participating in Winter Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 954 – Participating in Winter Sports.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 954. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is still ESLPod.com. That's right – it hasn't changed this week. It's still ESLPod.com. Go there, become a member, and do wnload a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Hanna and Ahmed about playing sports in the wintertime. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hanna: It’s finally snowing outside! Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled.

Ahmed: Sledding is for kids. I’m going downhill ski ing as soon as there’s enough powder. I can’t wait to feel the wind in my hair as  I careen down the side of a mountain.

Hanna: You’re more likely to be on the bunny slopes ! You’ve only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few  times. What makes you think you’ll be able to ski the slopes like an expe rt?

Ahmed: I can ice skate better than you can, so no m atter what, I know I’ll be better at it than you’ll be. When I get the hang of  skiing, I’ll probably try snowboarding.

Hanna: Now I know you’re blowing smoke. You don’t h ave the nerve.

Ahmed: Oh, yeah? I challenge you a game of one-on-o ne ice hockey.

Hanna: You’re twice my size! Make it a snowball fig ht.

Ahmed: You’re on!

[end of dialogue]

Hannah begins by saying, “It's finally snowing outs ide!” “To snow” means for small, soft ice crystals to fall from the sky. I th ink most of you have probably seen snow. It snows in cold places like Minnesota during  the wintertime, which in the northern hemisphere is anywhere between November an d, say, March.

Hanna says, “Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled .” “To get out” here means to remove from where it is stored – to take something out of a place where you have been keeping it until you are ready to use it again. “To get out” can also mean to leave. It's often used as a command, as an order. If you say to someone, “Get out,” you’re telling them to leave. I t's not a very nice way to tell someone to leave, but here we're not talking about leaving, we’re talking about sledding.

A “sled” (sled) is something you use to go down a h ill, usually one that has snow or ice on it. You usually have one, perhaps two peo ple in a sled. The sled is usually flat and allows you to either lie down on the sled or sit on the sled and then slide down, or move down, a hill that has snow  or ice on it. The word “sled” can also be a verb, “to sled,” which means the acti on of going down a hill with snow or ice on it in something called a “sled.”

Ahmed says, “Sledding is for kids.” He says it's no t something adults do. It’s something children do. He says, “I’m going downhill  skiing as soon as there’s enough powder.” “To ski” (ski) is also related to g oing down a hill with snow and/or ice on it. However, skis are long flat piece s of wood or other material that you put your feet into. You don't lie down or sit d own. You stand when you ski – or at least, you're supposed to stand when you ski.  I know the one time I tried skiing, I didn't stand very much. I spent most of the afternoon on the ground because I wasn't very good at skiing.

“Downhill skiing” is skiing down a hill or a mounta in. There's another kind of skiing called “cross-country skiing,” which Hanna w ill mention in a second. “Cross- (cross) country (country) skiing (skiing)” is skiing, but not going down a hill – rather, going across flat land, going across  the ground but moving your legs so that you are able to move forward. When you ski downhill, you more or less naturally go forward because it is a hill or a moun tain. In cross-country skiing, you have to really use your legs and arms in order to move yourself forward across the flat ground.

Ahmed is going downhill skiing as soon as there is enough powder. “Powder” (powder) usually refers to snow that has recently f allen on the ground and is still somewhat loose. Apparently, this is better for skii ng. Since I don't downhill ski, I don't know if that's true. But that's what I'm told . Ahmed says, “I can't wait to feel

the wind in my hair as I careen down the side of a mountain.” Ahmed is speaking very eloquently here, almost like he's writing a no vel. “I can't wait to feel the wind in my hair.” That means he can't wait to feel the w ind rushing and blowing through his hair. I guess he's not going to wear a hat.

“To careen” (careen) means to move at a very high s peed toward a specific place, usually going from side to side and slightly  out of control. We often talk about careening in a car or some other vehicle. Ahm ed is talking about careening down the side of a mountain. You have to have some experience in skiing in order to ski down the side of a mountain, because y ou will be going very fast and it would be easy to hurt yourself, or at least easy  to fall down every 10 feet. However, Ahmed says he can do that. He could ski do wn the side of a mountain.

Hanna doesn't believe him. She says, “You're more l ikely to be on the bunny slopes!” “Bunny (bunny) slopes (slopes)” are low hi lls covered with snow, used by people who are just learning how to ski. They wi ll not cause you to go down at a very high speed, and that's why they are used to teach people how to ski. We call those the “bunny slopes.” I think I've been on  a bunny slope once. That was the one time I tried to learn how to ski.

Hanna says, “You've only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few times. What makes you think you'll be able to ski the slopes like an expert?” Hanna says Ahmed has only been on a snowmo bile once. A “snowmobile” (snowmobile) is a vehicle – something you move in that has an engine or a motor in it. It's sort of like a motorc ycle that allows you to go across the snow.

“Cross-country skiing,” we've already explained, is  skiing across flat land using your arms and your legs in a very different way tha n if you go downhill skiing. Hanna doesn't think that Ahmed will be able to “ski  the slopes like an expert” – that is, to ski with a lot of expertise, to ski as though he were someone who was a very good skier. Ahmed says, “I can ice skate bet ter than you can. So no matter what, I know I'll be better at it you'll be.  When I get the hang of skiing, I'll probably try snowboarding.”

Ahmed says he can “ice skate” (skate). “To ice skat e” means to move across a flat piece of ice, wearing special shoes that have what are called “blades” (blades) on them. The blades allow you to move acro ss the ice. In order to play the sport of hockey, for example, you have to use i ce skates. People also use ice skates to perform on the ice in the Olympics. For e xample, you will see ice skating as one of the events. I'm speaking, of cour se, of the Winter Olympics.

Ahmed says because he knows how to ice skate, he wi ll be better at skiing than Hanna. I'm not sure if that's necessarily true, but  that's what Ahmed thinks is true.

He says, “When I get the hang of skiing, I'll proba bly try snowboarding.” “To get the hang (hang) of” something means to learn how to  do something – to learn how to do something well enough so that you can per form it with some competence. You are able to do it pretty well. I ne ver “got the hang of” skiing, at least downhill skiing. I know how to cross-country ski and have cross-country skied many times. I never liked it. It was a lot of  work. I found it much easier just to take a car.

Well, Ahmed says that he, after getting the hang of  skiing, will probably try snowboarding. “To snowboard” (snowboard) is to use a flat, short board to go down a hill of snow or ice, just like you would wit h skis. But skis are two separate pieces of equipment that attach to your feet. A “sn owboard” is one piece of equipment, if you will – one piece of wood, or what ever the material it is made out of – that you put your feet on and use to slide  down a hill with snow on it. A “snowboard” looks sort of like a skateboard, but wi thout the wheels.

Hanna says, “Now I know you're blowing smoke. You d on't have the nerve.” The expression “to blow smoke” (smoke) means very infor mally “to exaggerate” – to say something that isn't true while trying to make yourself appear better than other people. Hanna says, “You don't have the nerve ” (nerve). “To have the nerve” to do something means to have the courage, to have the strength – especially when we are talking about something that  may be difficult or inappropriate, even. If someone says, “He has a lot  of nerve,” he's not giving a compliment or saying something nice about that pers on. He's saying that that person has done something arrogant or rude that mos t polite people would not do.

Ahmed says, “Oh, yeah? I challenge you to a game of  one-on-one ice hockey.” “To challenge” someone is to say, “I want to compet e with you. I want to play a game with you.” “One-on-one” means there are just t wo people in the game. “Ice hockey” is a sport usually played by two teams of p layers that try to get a small black disc called a “puck” (puck) into a net. It's sort of like soccer, but with sticks and ice skates and a lot of hitting the other playe r. That's hockey. A lot of fighting takes place in ice hockey, at least in the United S tates. I played ice hockey. Yeah, I did. When I was seven.

Hanna says, “You’re twice my size,” meaning you are  twice as big as I am, physically. “Make it a snowball fight.” “Make it” m eans “let's change it” or “let's do this.” Hanna wants to have a snowball fight. A “sno wball” is a round ball of snow,

of course, that you make with your hands, and you t hrow it at other people. This is something that people who live in places where there is a lot of snow in the wintertime like to do. Certainly, when I was a kid,  we used to have snowball fights all the time, especially with my brothers and siste rs.

Ahmed says, “You're on.” That expression, “You're o n,” is used to show that you agree with and accept what the other person has pro posed, especially if it's a challenge to play a game or to have a contest of so me sort.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hanna: It’s finally snowing outside! Soon we’ll be able to get out the sled.

Ahmed: Sledding is for kids. I’m going downhill ski ing as soon as there’s enough powder. I can’t wait to feel the wind in my hair as  I careen down the side of a mountain.

Hanna: You’re more likely to be on the bunny slopes ! You’ve only been on a snowmobile once and gone cross-country skiing a few  times. What makes you think you’ll be able to ski the slopes like an expe rt?

Ahmed: I can ice skate better than you can, so no m atter what, I know I’ll be better at it than you’ll be. When I get the hang of  skiing, I’ll probably try snowboarding.

Hanna: Now I know you’re blowing smoke. You don’t h ave the nerve.

Ahmed: Oh, yeah? I challenge you a game of one-on-o ne ice hockey.

Hanna: You’re twice my size! Make it a snowball fig ht.

Ahmed: You’re on!

This episode is a dialogue between Eliana and Matt about dating a possessive person. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Eliana: You’re here! I didn’t think you’d be able to come.

Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as  much as the next guy.

Eliana: Yeah, but it’s been weeks since we’ve seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.

Matt: She doesn’t own me. She’s a little possessive , but I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.

Eliana: Doesn’t she get jealous if you so much as l ook at another woman?

Matt: She’s the jealous type, that’s true, but I re assure her all the time that she’s the only one I want. It’s true that she’s critical of other women, too, but what woman isn’t? She’s fine if she knows where I am and  whom I’m with.

Eliana: You mean you have to report in to her on yo ur whereabouts?

Matt: She likes to know what I’m doing. She’s just concerned about me, that’s all.

Eliana: She seems really controlling.

Matt: What did you say?

Eliana: Nothing. I see Xavier and Sophie over there . Ready to get our tickets?

Matt: Hold on one second. I just need to text Helen  an update. If she doesn’t hear from me every half hour, she worries. Isn’t that sw eet?

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about “dating” (dating). “To da te” means to see someone romantically – to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. T his is done before you get married. Once you get married, we don't talk about dating. We don't talk about anything, really, once you get married . . . no, I' m just kidding. “Dating” is seeing someone you are romantically interested in.

Eliana begins by saying to Matt, “You’re here! I di dn't think you'd be able to come” – I didn't think you'd be able to come to whe rever Eliana is. Matt says, “Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as much  as the next guy.” So, now we learn that Matt and Eliana are apparently outsid e of or inside of a movie theater, and that they are friends. You see how muc h we can learn in just a few words.

Matt says he likes seeing a movie as much as the ne xt guy. That expression, “as much as the next guy,” means “just like other peopl e.” It's a phrase we use to emphasize that what you do, or what you like to do,  is normal. It's what everyone else does as well. Eliana says, “Yeah, but it's bee n weeks since we've seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.” Now we learn that Matt is dating a girl by the name of Helen.

Matt says, “She doesn't own me.” When someone says,  “She doesn't own me,” he's probably lying, but he means, “That person doe sn't control me.” My girlfriend doesn't control me. She doesn't tell me what I have  to do. I don't listen to what she says. Again, this is completely imaginary. This  would never actually happen in the real world. But Matt is saying that his girl friend doesn't own him.

He says, “She's a little possessive.” “To be posses sive” (possessive) means to want to have something only for yourself. You don't  want to share it with anyone else. “To be possessive” means to want to have some thing and not have anyone else have it. If you are possessive of another pers on, you may not like that other person talking to friends or family members instead  of you.

That is sometimes a problem. In fact, it's usually a problem if a person is very possessive, what we might describe as “overly posse ssive.” Of course, you have to be possessive at some level – to some extent, a little bit – about a person that

you love. You want them to spend time with you more  than they spend time with other people.

Matt says, “I put my foot down when she gets too cl ingy.” The expression “to put your foot (foot) down” means to be very assertive, to clearly indicate what you are willing to do or not willing to do. You might s ay, for example, “If I see anyone not doing their work, I'm going to put my foot down  and tell you to go home and take all your stuff with you. You’re fired.” “I’m g oing to put my foot down” – I'm going to be very strong and assertive. I’m going to  say, “This is the law, this is the rule, and if you don't follow it, you are out.”

Matt is saying that he's putting his foot down. He' s being strong and assertive with his girlfriend whenever she gets too clingy. T he adjective “clingy” (clingy) comes from the verb “to cling” (cling). “To cling” is to hold on to something tightly. “To be clingy” is to want to be with another person  so much that the other person may get annoyed or bothered; the other person may n ot like you being that close to them or wanting to be close to them all the time .

Eliana says, “Doesn't she get jealous if you so muc h as look at another woman?” “Jealous” (jealous) is when you have negative feeli ngs of suspicion. You think another person is not being faithful to you or loya l to you. If a woman sees her husband talking to another beautiful woman, she mig ht get upset. She might be jealous. She may want the husband to come back and stop talking to the beautiful woman. The wife may think that her husban d is perhaps interested romantically in this other woman, and therefore doe sn't want him talking to her. That might be actually true. So, you know, sometime s being jealous is a good thing.

However, here Eliana says that Matt's girlfriend, H elen, gets jealous if Matt so much as looks at another woman. When we use the exp ression “so much as,” we mean – especially when referring to, usually, refer ring to something that doesn't seem very important – that it’s a very small action  that shouldn't cause the person to get angry. If a mother says to her childr en, “Don't eat this cake. If you so much as take one piece, I'm going to send you to  your rooms without dinner” – you won't get to eat tonight.

Kind of a mean mom, but you understand what she's s aying. She doesn't want the children taking the cake. If they eat so much a s one piece – even if they only eat one piece – she will punish them. She will send  them to their room without their dinner. Probably not a good idea, but it cert ainly does happen.

Matt says, “She’s the jealous type,” meaning she's the kind of person who gets jealous. Matt continues, “I reassure her all the ti me that she's the only one I want.” “To reassure” (reassure) means to say someth ing to someone to make them feel more confident or comfortable about a sit uation that they have doubts about. You’re trying to say to the other person, “D on't worry. Everything 's okay. What I am telling you is true.” Matt tries to reass ure Helen that Helen is the only one that Matt wants.

Matt says, “It's true that she's critical of other women, too, but what woman isn't?” “To be critical” (critical) means to say negative t hings about another person – to find errors, faults, or problems with what another person does or how another person acts or behaves. The verb is “to criticize.”  Matt says his girlfriend is critical of other women, “but what woman isn't?” meaning all  women are critical of other women. I guess that's what he’s saying. I'm not say ing that. Please don't email me and complain. Email Matt.

Matt continues, “She's fine if she knows where I am  and whom I'm with.” The girlfriend doesn't get jealous if she knows where M att is all the time, or at least she doesn't worry as much. Eliana says, “You mean y ou have to report in to her on your whereabouts?” “To report in” means to conta ct someone and tell them what you are doing, usually so that person can moni tor your progress. It's something you would do if you’re an employee with y our boss. You might report in if you are traveling somewhere for your company,  to tell your boss what you were doing. The idea of reporting in has with it the notion that the person you are reporting in to somehow has authority or control ov er you.

“Whereabouts” (whereabouts) is where you are. “Wher eabouts” is all one word. It's where you are located right now. The police of ten use this word in trying to find a person who is missing or who has perhaps com mitted a crime, has broken the law. “We don't know the whereabouts of this per son” – we don't know where this person is. Matt says his girlfriend likes to k now what he's doing. “She's just concerned about me, that's all,” Matt says.

Eliana says, “She seems really controlling.” “To be  controlling” means to want to make all of the decisions for another person, to wa nt to decide what the other person is going to do – to be in charge of another person. That's to be controlling. It's almost always considered a negative thing. Mat t says, “What did you say?” Eliana says, “Nothing.” Matt didn't hear exactly wh at Eliana was saying, or perhaps he didn't like what she was saying.

Sometimes, if you don't like what someone has said,  especially if they are insulting you or saying something critical about yo u or someone you love, you

might pretend as though you didn't hear them: “Excu se me, what did you say?” You’re basically telling the person to repeat what they said because you want to make sure that you heard it correctly, usually beca use it was something you didn't like.

Eliana, however, doesn't repeat what she says. Inst ead, she changes the subject. She decides to stop talking about this iss ue. She says, “I see Xavier and Sophie over there. Ready to get our tickets?” Matt says, “Hold on one second,” meaning wait just a few seconds. “I just need to te xt Helen an update.” “To text” someone means to send them a message, usually with your phone. An “update” (update) is the most recent information about somet hing, the latest news about something.

Matt says if his girlfriend doesn't hear from him –  doesn't receive some sort of message from him – every half hour, every 30 minute s, she worries. “Isn't that sweet?” “Sweet” (sweet) here means kind or caring o r considerate. Matt thinks it’s sweet that his girlfriend wants him to give he r updates every 30 minutes about what he's doing. He thinks it's a nice thing. It sh ows that she loves him, which she probably does. But it sounds as though she migh t be a little possessive.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Eliana: You’re here! I didn’t think you’d be able to come.

Matt: Why? I like seeing a movie with my friends as  much as the next guy.

Eliana: Yeah, but it’s been weeks since we’ve seen you, ever since you started dating Helen.

Matt: She doesn’t own me. She’s a little possessive , but I put my foot down when she gets too clingy.

Eliana: Doesn’t she get jealous if you so much as l ook at another woman?

Matt: She’s the jealous type, that’s true, but I re assure her all the time that she’s the only one I want. It’s true that she’s critical of other women, too, but what woman isn’t? She’s fine if she knows where I am and  whom I’m with.

Eliana: You mean you have to report in to her on yo ur whereabouts?

 Matt: She likes to know what I’m doing. She’s just concerned about me, that’s all.

Eliana: She seems really controlling.

Matt: What did you say?

Eliana: Nothing. I see Xavier and Sophie over there . Ready to get our tickets?

Matt: Hold on one second. I just need to text Helen  an update. If she doesn’t hear from me every half hour, she worries. Isn’t that sw eet?

We’re never critical of our scriptwriter. That's be cause she's a wonderful scriptwriter and there's nothing to be critical of.  I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.

# Running a Family-Owned Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 956 – Running a Family-Owned Business.

This episode is a story about someone who manages, or runs, a business owned by members of his family. Let’s get started.  > When I took over the family business three years ag o, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for. My uncle, who ran the busine ss before me, established a clear chain of command, which I thought would elimi nate infighting and bickering. I couldn’t have been more wrong.
> Despite clear lines of authority, family members te nd to take sides and play the blame game whenever anything goes wrong. In the end , they always look to me to resolve conflict, and I have no choice but to en ter the fray.
> Another big problem is the hangers-on. Those are the family members who aren’t suited for this line of work, but who need jobs. What do I DO with them?
> What do you do when everything falls on your should ers? Well, I’ve developed a thick skin, and when someone inevitably reminds me that blood is thicker than water, I remind them that business is business.

I begin our story by saying, “When I took over the family business.” “To take over” means to take control of, to take ownership of – to become the person who runs and manages an organization or, in this case, a company. “The family business” just means a business, a company, that yo ur family owns. I say that I “took over the family business three years ago.”

But, I say, “I didn't know what I was letting mysel f in for.” The expression “to let yourself in for” something means to put yourself in  a difficult or challenging situation without realizing it, without knowing it.  We might say “unintentionally.” I didn't realize I was going to be putting myself int o such a difficult situation when I took over the family business three years ago.

I said, “My uncle, who ran the business before me, established a clear chain of command.” A “chain (chain) of command” is the struc ture in an organization that determines who is responsible to whom, or who repor ts to whom. In other words, I have a boss, and my boss has a boss, and my boss’ s boss has a boss. The chain of command goes from me, to my boss, to my bo ss’s boss, to my boss’s boss’s boss, if that isn't too confusing. That's a “chain of command.”

We also talk about a chain of command in the milita ry – in the army, for example. At the top of the chain of command, at least in the  United States, is the “commander in chief.” That's the president of the U nited States. He gives orders to the general, who is head of the army, and the ge neral gives orders to the colonel, who gives orders to the major, who gives o rders to the captain, who gives orders to the lieutenant, who gives orders to  the sergeant, who gives orders to the corporal, who gives orders to the pri vate. That's the chain of command. That's who reports to whom, in the army an yway.

In a company, usually there is a CEO and perhaps a president, then you have a vice president, and under the vice president you ha ve other company bosses, company officials. There is a chain of command. A “ clear chain of command” is one that everyone knows and understands. In the arm y, there's a very clear chain of command. In companies there is usually a c lear chain of command that everyone knows about, but not always.

However, in the case of our family-owned business, even though there is a clear chain of command, that does not “eliminate infighti ng and bickering.” “To eliminate” (eliminate) means to get rid of somethin g, to not have something anymore. “Infighting” (infighting) is fighting with in a group or within an organization, within a family. “Infighting” relates  to conflicts or disagreements that people have in a group, usually a small group such as a family. “Bickering” (bickering) comes from the verb “to bicker” (bicker ). “To bicker” means to disagree, to argue, to fight – but using words, not  your fists or a weapon.

I say, “I couldn't have been more wrong.” I thought  the chain of command would eliminate infighting and bickering, but I was wrong . That's what I mean by the expression, “I couldn't have been more wrong.” I wa s very wrong. I say, “Despite clear lines of authority, family members tend to ta ke sides.” “Clear lines of

authority” is similar to a “clear chain of command. ” It's really the same thing. Even though we have clear lines of authority in the comp any, “family members still tend to take sides.” “Tend to” means they often or typically do something. Here, what they do is take sides.

“To take sides” means to show who you are in favor of and who you are against – who you support and who you oppose. I think what the story is saying here is that even though there are clear lines of authority , people don't follow them. People don't respect the authority of the people ab ove them, perhaps. Instead, they do what happens in most families, in most larg e families, anyway: they take sides. They decide that John is right and Mary is w rong, and so whenever there's a disagreement between John and Mary, they're going  to “side with” John. They're going to “take John's side,” we could say. They are going to support John.

I say family members also “play the blame game when ever anything goes wrong.” “To play the blame (blame) game” means to s ay that you are not responsible for anything that goes wrong. “It's not  my fault – it's her fault,” or “It's his fault.” You never take responsibility for thing s that go wrong. “To blame” someone means to tell them that they did something wrong. They are responsible for something bad that happened.

“In the end,” I say, meaning after all of these dis agreements and all of this bickering, “they,” meaning my family members, “alwa ys look to me to resolve conflict.” “To look to” someone means to go to some one expecting he or she will solve your problem or will take care of whatever is  wrong. “To look to” someone means not to take responsibility yourself, not to make the decision yourself, but to expect someone else to do it. My family looks to  me to resolve conflict. “To resolve conflict” (conflict) means to find a way to  end an argument, to end a disagreement.

I say, “I have no choice” – I have no option – “but  to enter the fray.” “To enter the fray” (fray) means to participate or join an argume nt. Another problem I have in the story is “hangers-on.” A “hanger (hanger) - on (on)” is a person who joins a group so they can get the benefits of that group, b ut doesn't actually do anything – often doesn't do the work they're supposed to do.  In this case, it would be family members who have jobs in the company but don 't work very much.

I say these hangers-on are “the family members who aren’t suited for this line of work.” “To be suited” (suited) means to have the qu alifications for something, to be prepared for something. A “line of work” is a ki nd of work, a type of job. My family members who aren't suited for this line of w ork – whatever the family

business is – still need jobs, and I don't know wha t to do with them. I say, “What do you do when everything falls on your shoulders?”  “To fall on your shoulders” means to be your responsibility, especially when it  is a difficult or challenging situation.

I say, “I've developed a thick skin.” The term “thi ck skin” means the ability to not be affected negatively by bad things that are happe ning, especially when things are said about you – when people criticize you, whe n they say bad things about you. “To have a thick skin” means not to be affecte d by that – to say, “Oh, whatever. I don't care.” The opposite of a “thick s kin” would be “thin skin.” If someone says I have “thin skin,” they mean I am eas ily affected by criticisms. When someone says something bad about me, I feel hu rt.

I say, to conclude our story, “When someone inevita bly reminds me that blood is thicker than water, I remind them that business is business.” “Inevitability” means unavoidably – something that will almost certainly happen. Someone always reminds me of an old expression in English, which is “blood is thicker than water.” The meaning of that expression is that fami ly relationships are stronger and more important than other relationships, such a s friendships. The blood that you share with your family members is thicker, and therefore stronger, than the water, if you will, that you share with your friend s.

In other words, your family relationships are more important and should be stronger than your relationships with your friends.  If you have to choose between your family and your friends, you should choose you r family. When someone tells me this, meaning that I should look out for, or be protective of, or loyal to my family, I remind that person that “businesses is bu siness.” This is another expression we use in American English. “Business is  business” means that we need to make decisions in the company that are good  for the company. Good for the business – not good for, in this case, the fami ly members.

The expression “businesses is business” is usually used in cases where someone is saying that a business should make a dec ision based upon some personal reason or some reason that has nothing to do with the economic well- being of the company. “Is this going to help the co mpany or hurt the company?” That's what we're trying to say in the expression “ business is business.”

People might also say in this situation, “I don't want to mix personal things with business” or “I don't want to mix family with busin ess.” They mean they want to make their business decisions based upon the things  that are important for the business, not for one's family or friends.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

When I took over the family business three years ag o, I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for. My uncle, who ran the busine ss before me, established a clear chain of command, which I thought would elimi nate infighting and bickering. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Despite clear lines of authority, family members te nd to take sides and play the blame game whenever anything goes wrong. In the end , they always look to me to resolve conflict, and I have no choice but to en ter the fray.

Another big problem is the hangers-on. Those are the family members who aren’t suited for this line of work, but who need jobs. What do I do with them?

What do you do when everything falls on your should ers? Well, I’ve developed a thick skin, and when someone inevitably reminds me that blood is thicker than water, I remind them that business is business.

# Doping in Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 957 – Doping in Sports.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 957. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This dialogue on this episode is between Mia and Al ex about using drugs to perform better when playing sports. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Mia: This is ridiculous! They’re going to suspend E ric Rodrigo for doping.

Alex: From what I’ve read, he failed his random dru g test and they found performance-enhancing drugs in his system.

Mia: But he’s one of the best players on the team. Without him, we won’t have a chance to get to the playoffs.

Alex: He should have thought of that before he deci ded to cheat. I’m surprised they’re only suspending him for a few games. Last y ear, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and strippe d of his championship titles.

Mia: In my opinion, they completely overreacted and  one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.

Alex: You don’t think that people who use steroids and other banned substances should be punished?

Mia: Not when the fans are the ones who really pay the price.

Alex: So you’re in favor of allowing performance-en hancing drugs in sports?

Mia: Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it leve ls the playing field.

Alex: I am really glad you’re not the commissioner!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins by Mia saying, “This is ridicul ous. They're going to suspend Eric Rodrigo for doping.” When someone says, “This is ridiculous,” they mean this is wrong, this is crazy. Something is happenin g that doesn't make any sense.

Mia says, “They're going to suspend Eric Rodrigo for doping.” “To suspend” (suspend) means to temporarily not allow someone to  do something. If a student does something wrong at school – say, gets into a f ight with another student – he might be suspended. The school may say, “You can't come to class for the next week. You're suspended. You have to stay home or go  out and fight somebody on the street.” No, they don't want them to fight s omeone on the street. They just want the student to be punished. So, when you “susp end” someone from something, you're usually punishing them for doing something wrong.

This person, Eric, is being suspended for, or becau se of, “doping” (doping). “Doping” is the practice of using illegal drugs to improve your athletic performance. The drugs actually aren't always illeg al. They’re just not allowed in certain competitions. This, of course, has been a p roblem in the last 25, 30 years in the Olympics and, more prominently, in the Tour de France. Alex says, “From what I've read, he” – meaning Eric – “failed his ra ndom drug test and they found performance enhancing drugs in his system.” A “drug  test” is when you are tested to see whether you have taken any drugs. The y could do this by taking some of your blood. That's a very common type of dr ug test.

A “random drug test” is when you don't know when th ey're going to test you. They often test athletes randomly so that the athle te can't prepare; the athlete can't stop taking the drug for a few days so that the drug test doesn't find anything in their system. Alex says that Eric's ran dom drug test found that he was taking “performance-enhancing drugs,” sometimes ref erred to by their abbreviation “PEDs.” “Performance-enhancing drugs” are drugs that make you perform better – specifically, help an athlete perf orm better, make him or her stronger or faster.

When we talk about drug tests and trying to detect,  or see, whether someone is using a certain kind of drug, we often use the term  “system,” as in: “They found drugs in his system.” “System” (system) here just m eans in some part of your body. We talk about the “digestive system.” That's the parts of your body that allow you to eat food and get energy from that food . You have the “respiratory system.” The “respiratory system” consists of the p arts of your body that allow you to breathe – your lungs, for example. When we s ay that they found PEDs in

his system, we mean they found drugs in the blood s ample that they took from him.

Mia says that Eric is “one of the best players on the team.” “Without him, we won't have a chance” – we won't get the opportunity  – “to get to the playoffs.” In most sports, especially professional sports, at the  end of the season – at the end of the period of time when the teams play – there is usually a competition that involves “playoffs.” The best teams from that year play each other to determine who is the very best. So, in American football you have playoffs that lead to the Super Bowl, where the two best teams play each othe r. In American baseball, we have the playoffs that lead to the World Series. In  international soccer, you have the World Cup. Those all involve playoffs – teams p laying each other to determine which team is the best.

Alex says that Eric “should have thought of that be fore he decided to cheat.” Alex is saying that Eric should have thought of the cons equences of his actions when he took these performance-enhancing drugs. Alex say s that he has cheated. “To cheat” (cheat) means to be dishonest in the way tha t you are playing or in the way that you are competing. You can also cheat in s chool. You can look at someone else's answers on a test. That would be als o be considered cheating. It would also be considered stupid, if the person next  to you doesn't know any more than you do.

Alex says, “I’m surprised they’re only suspending h im for a few games. Last year, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and stripped of his championship titles.” “To be banned (banned) for li fe” means you are not allowed to do something ever again. This is something that happens, for example, if an athlete does something really bad, really wrong. He  or she might be banned for life from competing professionally in that sport. T his doesn't happen very often. It does happen sometimes.

There was a very famous baseball player who was ban ned for life even though he was one of the best baseball players of the twen tieth century, a man by the name of Pete Rose. We won't go into his story. It is possible to be banned for life, and that's what happened in our dialogue to another  player – not to Eric, to someone else. This person also was “stripped of his  championship titles.” “To strip” (strip) means to take something off. Typical ly, we use this verb in talking about your clothing. To take your clothing off – al l of your clothing off – would be to strip. There are, of course, some people who do that professionally, but we’re not going to talk about that here.

In our dialogue, the verb “to strip” means to take away some honor or some prize or some award from someone because they've done som ething wrong. Our athlete who was banned for life was “stripped of his championship titles.” The term “titles” here refers to honors or awards that people win. “Championship titles” would be awards that you won for being the best team, for winning a competition that determined who the best team was o r the best player was. In the Olympics, we give people who win a medal – either a  gold, silver, or bronze medal. If they later find that that person cheated,  they can strip that person of his or her medals. The medals represent the title, if y ou will – the award or honor.

Mia says, “In my opinion, they completely overreact ed and one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.” “To react (react) to” something is to respond to something – to do something because some thing else has been done. “To overreact” means to react too strongly to  something. If someone criticizes you by saying that your shirt is a littl e dirty, and you decide to take out a gun and shoot that person, that would be overreacti ng. You're reacting much too strongly given the situation. You shouldn't kill pe ople who criticize you if you have a dirty shirt or whatever. You shouldn't kill anyon e anyway, but definitely not for a criticism of your shirt.

Mia says the sporting organization – of whatever sp ort this is – overreacted by suspending Eric Rodrigo, and now “one of the best p layers in the game is off the field forever.” The “field” is the area, the ground , where they play on. You can have a football field. You can have a soccer field.  You can have a baseball field. Alex says, “You don't think that people who use ste roids and other banned substances should be punished?” “Steroids” (steroid s) are drugs that are often made and given to athletes to make them stronger. I  take steroids, for example, to do my podcasts. I need that extra strength. I'm kidding, of course. “Banned substances” are drugs or other things that you put into your body that are not allowed. “To ban” something means to prohibit it.

Mia says, “Not when the fans are the ones who reall y pay the price.” Mia is not in favor of punishing athletes because “the fans” – the people who watch the sport – “are the ones who really pay the price.” “To pay the price” here doesn’t refer to money, but rather any other sort of negative conseq uence or bad result that comes from some action. If you want to run a marath on – if you want to run 26 miles – you have to pay the price. The price may be  physical pain. It may be having to work extra hard. It may mean having to ge t up early in the morning to go out and practice your running. That would be pay ing the price.

Alex says, “So you're in favor of allowing performa nce-enhancing drugs in sports?” Mia says, “Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it levels the playing

field.” Mia is saying that if everyone is taking dr ugs, then no one has an advantage. When no one has any advantage, we say the playing field is “level” (level). “Level” can also be a verb, “to level,” wh ich means to make something even, so that one part is not higher than the other . In this case, one person is not better than the other. “To level the playing field, ” then, means to make everything fair by not giving any person an advantage over the  other.

Alex said, “I am really glad you're not the commiss ioner.” The “commissioner” (commissioner) is a person whose job it is to lead,  or be in charge of, some typically government department, although it is als o used in the United States for large sporting organizations. There is a commission er, or a president, of Major League Baseball. There's a commissioner, or leader,  of the National Football League. That's what Alex is referring to here. He's  saying that he's glad that Mia is not in charge of – is not the commissioner of – whatever sporting organization they are a member of. We never learned what sport M ia and Alex are talking about here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mia: This is ridiculous! They’re going to suspend E ric Rodrigo for doping.

Alex: From what I’ve read, he failed his random dru g test and they found performance-enhancing drugs in his system.

Mia: But he’s one of the best players on the team. Without him, we won’t have a chance to get to the playoffs.

Alex: He should have thought of that before he deci ded to cheat. I’m surprised they’re only suspending him for a few games. Last y ear, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and strippe d of his championship titles.

Mia: In my opinion, they completely overreacted and  one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.

Alex: You don’t think that people who use steroids and other banned substances should be punished?

Mia: Not when the fans are the ones who really pay the price.

Alex: So you’re in favor of allowing performance-en hancing drugs in sports?

 Mia: Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it leve ls the playing field.

Alex: I am really glad you’re not the commissioner!

She doesn't need any performance-enhancing drugs to  write her scripts. I refer, of course, to our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.

# Selecting a Neighborhood to Live In

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 958 – Selecting a Neighborhood to Live In.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 958. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about choosing a place to live in a city or town. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leona: I want to live close to downtown. We can get  everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.

Jeremy: Downtown is always bustling and noisy, and the crime rate is really high. I’d rather have proximity to parks and open spaces.

Leona: If we lived downtown, we wouldn’t have to wo rry about commute time and traffic. I could walk to work and you could take pu blic transportation.

Jeremy: That’s true, but there aren’t any good scho ols near downtown.

Leona: Hello, we don’t have any kids.

Jeremy: Not yet. I want to settle down somewhere for a while, not move every couple of years.

Leona: Is that why you want to live in the suburbs?  The suburbs have no character. Everything is cookie-cutter.

Jeremy: That’s not true.

Leona: Downtown has character and it’s close to nig htlife.

Jeremy: That’s less important to me than a place in  a quiet neighborhood. Imagine lounging in the backyard or taking a walk i n the park. We can raise our kids in a close-knit community.

Leona: I think you’re planning for a family that we  don’t have.

Jeremy: Yet!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Leona saying to Jeremy, “I  want to live close to downtown.” “Downtown” (downtown) is the center of a  city, especially a larger city with a lot of businesses in it, but really any  city or town can have a downtown. Sometimes, in a small town, the downtown area is very small, only two or three blocks long. But in a big city, the do wntown area can be very large, such as here in Los Angeles. Leona wants to live cl ose to downtown.

She says, “We can get everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.” To travel “on foot” means to walk. It's just another way of s aying you can walk to these places. What kind of places? Well, Leona tells us t hat they can walk “to most amenities.” “Amenities” (amenities) are usually fea tures or aspects or things about a certain area or a certain place that make it more comfortable, more enjoyable.

Normally we talk about amenities in a hotel. For ex ample, the hotel might have a swimming pool and a spa. Those would be “amenities”  – nice things that add to the pleasure of being in the hotel. We don't usuall y talk about amenities in terms of places where you live, but it is possible, and t hat's what Leona is doing here. She’s saying that they can walk to all the interest ing things that they want. They will not have to get in their car and drive to diff erent places.

Jeremy says, “Downtown is always bustling and noisy .” “To be bustling” (busting) means to be very busy. A place where a lot of peopl e are coming and going could be described as “bustling.” “Noisy,” of cours e, is when there is a lot of loud noise. Noisy is usually a bad thing when you are th inking about where you want to live, and that’s certainly Jeremy's opinion. He doesn't want to live in the downtown area.

He says, “The crime rate is really high.” The “crim e rate” (rate) refers to the number of crimes that take place in a certain area.  If the crime rate is high, that means there is a lot of crime in that area – a lot of people who are being robbed or killed or having their cars stolen, and so forth . Jeremy says, “I’d rather” –

meaning I would prefer to – “have proximity to park s and open spaces.” “Proximity (proximity) to” something is closeness to something – how close you are to a certain thing. “Proximity to” refers to di stance.

We could say, “We are in close proximity to several  stores and gas stations.” Those things are close to us. They are not very far  from us. “Open spaces” refers to places like parks or areas where there aren't an y buildings. Jeremy doesn't want to be downtown. He wants the opposite of downt own. He wants to be in a place where there is a lot of open space.

Leona says, “If we lived downtown, we wouldn't have  to worry about commute time and traffic.” “To commute” (commute) means to travel from your house or apartment to the place where you work. Your “commut e time” would be how long it takes you to get there. For example, I used to w ork at the university, and when I did that, I had to commute about 45 minutes to an  hour each way. So, 45 minutes to get there and then 45 minutes to come ho me by car. That was my “commute time.”

Leona says if they lived in downtown, they wouldn't  have to worry about commute time – because they would be close to their  jobs, one supposes. Leona says, “I could walk to work and you could take publ ic transportation.” So, Leona works downtown, and Jeremy works somewhere close to  downtown where you can take public transportation. “Public transportat ion” refers to a government- owned bus or subway or train – anything that the av erage person can get on and use could be called public transportation.

It might not be owned by the government, although u sually in the United States the buses and trains and subways are owned by the l ocal government. The word “public” can mean owned by the government or it can  mean something that anyone can use, that you don't need any special per mission to use. You could have a private museum that is “open to the public,”  meaning anyone can go there. Jeremy still doesn't like Leona’s idea. He s ays, “That's true, but there aren't any good schools near downtown.”

Leona says, “Hello, we don't have any kids.” The us e of the word “hello” is supposed to be funny. When a person says something that indicates that he hasn't thought of something very obvious – that he' s not considering something that should be very clear to him – we might use this expression, or this word, “hello.” But we say it in a certain way – the way t hat Leona says it. “Hello,” meaning you are forgetting something or you are not  remembering something that is very obvious or that should be clear to you .

In this case, Jeremy is talking about schools for c hildren, and Leona reminds him that they don't have any children. Jeremy says, how ever, “Not yet,” meaning we don't yet have any kids, but we might in the future . He says, “I want to settle down somewhere for a while, not move every couple of years.” “To settle down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to move to a pla ce and stay there for a long time – to move to a certain community or neighborho od and stay there for many years.

Sometimes, the expression “to settle down” refers to a lot of different things that a young person might consider doing as they become adults and more mature, such as getting married, buying a house, having chi ldren. Those might also be considered part of “settling down” somewhere. Leona  says, “Is that why you want to live in the suburbs?” The “suburbs” (suburbs) are the areas outside of the main city.

Leona says, “The suburbs have no character.” “Chara cter” here refers to things that make a person or a place interesting. If you s ay, “This house has a lot of character,” you mean it's interesting. Perhaps it's  old and has some historic interest to you, or it might just be decorated in a  way that makes it interesting. Those would be uses of the term “character” in desc ribing the place.

Leona says, “Everything” – meaning everything in the suburbs – “is cookie- cutter.” “Cookie (cookie) - cutter (cutter)” is an expression that means the same, boring, not very original. If you think about makin g cookies, the things you eat, you might think about something that you use to mak e sure all the cookies are the same shape. That little kitchen instrument, tha t kitchen tool, is called a “cookie cutter,” and makes sure that all of the coo kies look the same.

So, if you want to make cookies in the shape of a b unny, then you would have a cookie cutter in the shape of a bunny, and you coul d make each cookie look that way. That is what cookie cutters are. But the expre ssion used in general conversation refers to things that are identical, b ut usually more than that – things that are considered not interesting, that la ck or don't have character.

Jeremy says, “That's not true” – what Leona said ab out the suburbs. Leona says, “Downtown has character and it’s close to nightlife .” “Nightlife” (nightlife) – one word – refers to things that you would do at night for excitement, such as going to a bar or going dancing. That would be all part of n ightlife. We usually associate the idea of nightlife with younger people who are g oing out and drinking and dancing and having a good time. All of that ends wh en you get married.

Jeremy says, “That's less important to me than a pl ace in a quiet neighborhood.” Jeremy is saying that nightlife is not important to  him. He says, “Imagine lounging in the backyard or taking a walk in the park.” “To lounge” (lounge) means to relax, usually by lying down in a chair or on a cou ch. Jeremy is talking about lounging in the backyard – in the place behind your  house.

He says, “We can raise our kids in a close-knit com munity.” “Close (close) - knit (knit)” refers to a group or a place where everyone  is very close to each other. They're all friends. They all care about each other . They all know each other. A “close-knit community” would be a neighborhood or a n area where everyone knows each other. Everyone is friends with each oth er. Jeremy wants to live in a close-knit community because it would be good for their children.

Leona says, “I think you’re planning for a family t hat we don't have,” and Jeremy responds by saying, “Yet,” meaning we don't have on e yet, but we will have a family someday.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Leona: I want to live close to downtown. We can get  everywhere on foot and walk to most amenities.

Jeremy: Downtown is always bustling and noisy, and the crime rate is really high. I’d rather have proximity to parks and open spaces.

Leona: If we lived downtown, we wouldn’t have to wo rry about commute time and traffic. I could walk to work and you could take pu blic transportation.

Jeremy: Yet!

# A Territorial Dispute

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 959 – A Territorial Dispute.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 959. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.

This episode is a dialogue between Roberta and Eli about territorial disputes – when two countries have disagreements about who own s a certain piece of land. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberta: So this is McQuillanland!

Eli: Well, that depends on whom you ask. This area has been under territorial dispute since 1963.

Roberta: Who else claims it?

Eli: Its neighbor, Tseland. Tseland annexed it afte r the brief war in 1963, but McQuillanland refuses to recognize the change in bo undaries.

Roberta: I didn’t know that.

Eli: McQuillanland contends that the demarcation for the border is this river, but Tseland says that it rules over this entire valley.  Since most of the people who live here consider themselves McQuillanlanders, the y say possession is nine- tenths of the law.

Roberta: Wasn’t there a treaty at the end of the co nflict?

Eli: There was, but the wording was vague and the d ispute has continued to this day.

Roberta: So if we committed a crime right here, rig ht now, which country would have jurisdiction?

 Eli: Let’s not find out.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Roberta saying to Eli, “So  this is McQuillanland!” Eli says, “Well, that depends on whom you ask.” It depe nds on the person you ask, Eli is saying, whether this is McQuillanland or not . He says, “This area has been under territorial dispute since 1963.” When we say something is “under dispute” (dispute), we mean that people disagree about it. O ften it's a disagreement that has been going on for many years. A “territorial (t erritorial) dispute” is a disagreement about who owns a certain piece of land . The word “territorial” comes from the noun “territory,” which is another w ay of referring to land owned by a certain country.

Roberta says, “Who else claims it?” “To claim” (cla im) here means to say that you own it, that it is yours. If I say, for example , “The United States claims the island of Guam in the South Pacific,” I mean the Un ited States says that they own Guam, that it is theirs. Here, the word refers to owning a certain piece of territory, a certain area of land. Eli says that the neighbor of McQuillanland – Tseland – claims this area.

“Tseland annexed it after a brief war in 1963,” Eli  tells us. “To annex” (annex) means to add some area of land to your land, to say  it is yours. In Los Angeles, for example, the city of Los Angeles over the years  has annexed certain areas that were not part of the city, but then became par t of the city. The city is taking ownership of a certain part of land.

Countries can “annex” certain areas of land from ot her countries. Basically, they’re stealing it from other countries, but they often have reasons and justifications for why they are taking the land. Ts eland annexed this land where Eli and Roberta are standing after a brief, or shor t, war in 1963. “But,” Eli continues, “McQuillanland refuses to recognize the change in boundaries.” A “boundary” (boundary) is a line that separates two different pieces of land, usually. That's how it's been used here. We might a lso say “border” (border). That's what separates two pieces of land – in this case, two different countries.

“McQuillanland refuses to recognize the change in b oundaries.” “To recognize” is to say, “Okay, yes, we agree.” In this case, McQuil lanland would have to agree that Tseland owns that particular piece of land. Of  course they don't. Everyone knows that Tseland does not own this piece of land,  that they illegally took the land back in 1963. But for the sake of the story, f or the purposes of the story, we

will not take sides. We will not decide who is righ t, McQuillanland or Tseland. We all know McQuillanland is right, but I won't say th at, at least more than three or four more times.

Roberta says, “I didn't know that.” She didn't know  that McQuillanland refused to recognize the change in boundaries. Eli says, “McQu illanland contends that the demarcation for the border is this river, but Tsela nd says that it rules over this entire valley.” To say that McQuillanland “contends ” (contends) that something is true means that McQuillanland says this in an argum ent or in a dispute. We use the verb “to contend” in this context when we are t alking about two people who disagree about something. What I “contend” is what I think is true.

“McQuillanland contends that the demarcation for the border is this river.” Demarcation” (demarcation) refers to the process of  setting, or establishing, boundaries or borders, especially when these are be ing changed from the way they were before. The “demarcation” for the border would be the determination of where the border is – where the border between, in this case, McQuillanland and Tseland is. McQuillanland says the demarcation for the border is this river, “but Tseland says that it rules over this entire valley. ” “To rule over” an area means to be in charge of, to own, to officially be the owner  of that area.

Usually we talk about countries ruling over certain  areas. Tseland says it “rules over this entire valley.” A “valley” (valley) is the place or land in between two hills or two mountains, more typically. A valley often ha s a river that goes through it. Eli says, “Since most of the people who live here c onsider themselves McQuillanlanders, they say possession is nine-tenth s of the law.” Most of the people who live in this area consider themselves – that is, they think of themselves – as being citizens of McQuillanland. Th at is what a “McQuillanlander” would be, I guess.

“They say possession is nine-tenths of the law.” Th is is an old expression that means that when there is a disagreement about who o wns something, the person, or in this case the country, that actually has possession of it – that actually has it with them or has it, in this case, under their control – is the legal owner. “To possess” something means to have it. You  can possess something that you don't own. You can own something that you don't possess. “To own” something means that it legally belongs to you. “To  possess” something means to actually have it. So, I own a car, but if someon e steals my car, I no longer possess my car. “I don't have it in my possession,”  we could say.

“Possession is nine-tenths of the law” means that i f you actually have it, that's the most important thing, and that in some ways that is  more proof that you own

something. Of course, that isn't really true, but it's an expression that people use to indicate that it doesn't matter what other peopl e say about who owns a certain thing; it's actually having it that is the best way  of determining the true owner. I'm not talking about the way American law actually wor ks, however. This has nothing to do with the laws of the U.S. or any othe r country. It has to do with the way people think about things.

Roberta says, “Wasn't there a treaty at the end of the conflict?” A “treaty” (treaty) is a formal agreement between two countries about s ome important issue or topic. A “conflict” (conflict) is a war when two co untries are fighting, or when two people are fighting. That could also be called a “c onflict.” Roberta is asking if there was a treaty at the end of the 1963 conflict.  Eli says, “There was, but the wording was vague and the dispute has continued to this day.” “Wording” (wording) refers to the language that was used to e xpress something, especially if it's in an official or legal document.

The word “vague” (vague) means unclear, uncertain, difficult to understand. If someone is being “vague” with you, they're not givi ng you a clear answer. We would say they're “not giving you a straight answer .” If the wording is vague, it's not clear when you read the treaty what it actually  says. That's true with a lot of laws, I think. Eli says, “The dispute” – the disagr eement – “has continued to this day,” meaning up until the present time. Roberta sa ys, “So if we committed a crime right here, right now, which country would ha ve jurisdiction?”

“To commit a crime” means to break the law – to do something against the law, like stealing my car, for example. “Jurisdiction” ( jurisdiction) is the official, legal power that a government has over people in a certai n area. In the United States, for example, there are many different cities within  a state. The police in each city have jurisdiction over the people in that city, but  they can't go to another city and arrest people. The police don't have jurisdiction i n the other cities. States and cities and other governments talk about jurisdictio n to refer to who has the authority, who has the power, to determine what hap pens in this specific area.

Eli doesn't want to find out which country would ha ve jurisdiction if they committed a crime, and that's why he ends our dialo gue by saying, “Let's not find out,” meaning let's not do something wrong and then , by that process, discover who has jurisdiction. That sounds like a pretty goo d idea to me.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roberta: So this is McQuillanland!

Eli: Well, that depends on whom you ask. This area has been under territorial dispute since 1963.

Roberta: Who else claims it?

Eli: Its neighbor, Tseland. Tseland annexed it afte r the brief war in 1963, but McQuillanland refuses to recognize the change in bo undaries.

Roberta: I didn’t know that.

Eli: McQuillanland contends that the demarcation for the border is this river, but Tseland says that it rules over this entire valley.  Since most of the people who live here consider themselves McQuillanlanders, the y say possession is nine- tenths of the law.

Roberta: Wasn’t there a treaty at the end of the co nflict?

Eli: There was, but the wording was vague and the d ispute has continued to this day.

Roberta: So if we committed a crime right here, rig ht now, which country would have jurisdiction?

Eli: Let’s not find out.

[end of dialogue]

There is no relationship between our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse, and Tseland in this script. It’s just a coincidence.

# Giving Someone Your Recommendation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 960 – Giving Someone Your Recommendation.

This episode is called “Giving Someone Your Recomme ndation.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jimmy: My cousin Sal said that he put in an applica tion for a job here.

Suzanne: Yeah, that’s right.

Jimmy: Well?

Suzanne: Well, what?

Jimmy: Are you going to hire him?

Suzanne: I’m not sure. He doesn’t have any experien ce and he didn’t provide any references.

Jimmy: I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He’s a re ally nice guy.

Suzanne: I appreciate you putting in a good word for him, but I need more assurance than that he’s a nice guy. He needs to ha ve the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.

Jimmy: What he doesn’t know he’ll learn on the job.  He’s a quick study.

Suzanne: How can I justify hiring someone with no e xperience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified?

Jimmy: He has my ringing endorsement. What else do you need? He’ll work as hard as I do.

Suzanne: That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue between Jimmy and Suzanne begins by Ji mmy saying, “My cousin Sal said that he put in an application for a job he re.” “To put in an application” means to apply for a job or something that you are hoping to get from a company or an organization. Normally, we use this expressio n when we’re talking about applying for a job. You want to get a job at a cert ain company, so you go and you “put in an application.” You fill out a form. You g ive them your name, your address, who you work for now, and so forth.

Suzanne said, “Yeah, that's right,” meaning that is  correct. She knows that Jimmy's cousin Sal put in an application. Jimmy say s, “Well?” He's expecting Suzanne to give him some news about this applicatio n. Suzanne, however, doesn't want to give him the information, or perhap s doesn't think Jimmy should be asking about it. She says, “Well, what?” We use that expression – “Well, what?” – when confused about what the other person wants. Suzanne isn’t sure what Jimmy is asking her. Jimmy says, “Are you goin g to hire him?” “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job.

Suzanne says, “I'm not sure. He doesn't have any ex perience and he didn't provide any references.” Suzanne says that Sal “doe sn't have any experience” – he hasn't worked in this kind of job before, the ki nd of job he's applying for. He also didn't provide any “references” (references). A “reference” is the name and, usually, telephone number or email of someone who can give the company information about you and how good of a worker you are. Those are what we would call “professional references” – people who can give information about your qualifications.

Sometimes, for example, if you are trying to rent a n apartment, you may have to provide what we call “personal references.” A “pers onal reference” would be a friend or a family member who can tell the person r enting the apartment whether you are a good person or not – whether you cause pr oblems. However, in this case, we’re talking about professional references. Suzanne says Sal didn't provide any. He didn't give any names and telephone  numbers.

 Jimmy says, “I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He' s a really nice guy.” “To vouch (vouch) for” someone is to indicate that you know t his person is a good person and that the person you are talking to can believe you. It's a way of indicating to someone that this person is a good person and that you can trust me – I know. I know this person; I will vouch for him or vouch for  her.

Jimmy says that Sal is “solid” (solid). When we say  a person is “solid,” we mean he is a good person. He is a reliable person. He is  a trustworthy person. The word “solid” is used in this way when we’re talking  about a person. It's different when we’re talking about a physical object like the  table. That's a different kind of solid. When you talk about a person being solid, yo u mean they’re a good person. They’re a trustworthy person.

Suzanne says, “I appreciate you putting in a good w ord for him, but I need more assurance than that he's a nice guy.” “To put in a good word for” someone means to say something good about a person or to re commend a person, often in an informal way. You know someone, for example, who is looking for a  job, and you know that there is a job at the company where you work. You m ight say to this person – a friend, perhaps – “I'll put in a good word for you. ” That means I will say nice things about you to the boss – the person responsib le for hiring for this particular position.

Notice, “to put in application” and “to put in a go od word” are both uses of the phrasal verb “to put in,” but in different circumst ances and with different meanings. Suzanne says she needs “more assurance.” “Assurance” (assurance) means words or actions that make you feel certain a bout something – that make you feel that something will happen in a certain wa y. “I want assurance that you are going to pay me every month.” You need to give me evidence. You need to give me proof. You need to do something or say some thing that shows me that you will pay your bill every month. That's an examp le of “assurance.”

Don't confuse this with “insurance” (insurance). “I nsurance” is something you buy from a company in case you have an accident or a pr oblem. The company will then pay for your expenses. We have “health insuran ce” and “car insurance” and “home insurance.” All those are very different than  the word we're talking about here, which is an “assurance.” Suzanne continues, “ He needs to have the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.” “Temperament” (temperament) refers to your personality or your personal charact eristics that seem to be permanent – that you always have.

Some people have a very happy temperament. They’re always happy. It doesn't matter what's happening; they’re always smiling and  joking and having a good time. That would be their temperament. Suzanne says  this person has to have the temperament for this job, whatever this job is – we don't know. “Work ethic” (ethic) is your commitment to work hard. Someone wh o has a “good work ethic” comes to work on time, works hard, never goofs off,  doesn't listen to podcasts at work – that would be someone with a good work ethic . Like you.

“Skills” would be abilities or things that you are able to do for the job. Jimmy says, “What he doesn't know, he'll learn on the job . He's a quick study.” To learn something or do something “on the job” means after you are hired, after you start working at that position. Jimmy says, “Don't worry”  – his cousin is “a quick study.” The expression “quick study” is used to describe a person who can learn things very quickly, who doesn't need a lot of instruction  or help. Suzanne says, “How can I justify hiring someone with no experience, wh ile passing up applicants who are better qualified?”

“To justify” (justify) means to provide a logical r eason for something, to be able to explain, usually to someone higher up in the compan y, why you did what you did. Suzanne says she cannot justify “hiring someone wit h no experience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified.” “T o pass up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to choose not to do something or, in this case, to choose not to select someone. “To be qualified” means to h ave the skills to do something, to have the experience and ability to ac complish a certain task or do a certain job.

Jimmy says that his cousin has his “ringing endorse ment.” A “ringing (ringing) endorsement” is very strong praise for someone – wh en you say something about a person that suggests that they are wonderfu l, that they can do whatever you want them to do. It's often used when we are re commending someone or something to another person. It's often used when w e are talking about recommending someone for a job, as is the case in o ur dialogue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jimmy: My cousin Sal said that he put in an applica tion for a job here.

Suzanne: Yeah, that’s right.

Jimmy: Well?

 Suzanne: Well, what?

Jimmy: Are you going to hire him?

Suzanne: I’m not sure. He doesn’t have any experien ce and he didn’t provide any references.

Jimmy: I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He’s a re ally nice guy.

Suzanne: I appreciate you putting in a good word for him, but I need more assurance than that he’s a nice guy. He needs to ha ve the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.

Jimmy: What he doesn’t know he’ll learn on the job.  He’s a quick study.

Suzanne: How can I justify hiring someone with no e xperience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified?

Jimmy: He has my ringing endorsement. What else do you need? He’ll work as hard as I do.

Suzanne: That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.

This episode is a dialogue between Arthur and Marth a about learning how to dance. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Arthur: You know that you’ve taken on an impossible  task, right?

Martha: Teaching you to dance? I’m sure you’re sell ing yourself short.

Arthur: No, really, I have two left feet. I’m compl etely uncoordinated and have no sense of rhythm. I’m just not cut out for dancing.

Martha: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll jus t start by loosening up and swaying to the music. You don’t even need to swing your hips yet.

Arthur: That’s good, because I don’t think I can le arn even the simplest dance steps.

Martha: Not only will I teach you some useful dance  steps, we’ll put together a dance routine down the line.

Arthur: That seems like a pipe dream to me.

Martha: Nonsense. Before long, dancing to you will be as effortless as breathing.

Arthur: But until then, I’ll look and feel like a d ancing hippo!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Arthur saying, “You know t hat you’ve taken on an impossible task, right?” “To take on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to agree to do something that is perhaps going to be very difficult – to accept a challenge to do something that will be hard. “I've taken on an impossible task” means I'm trying to do something that will be very difficult, and perhaps even not, or “impossible,” altogether. Arthur makes this into  a question by adding the word “right” at the end and using what is called a “risi ng intonation,” where the voice goes up. “You're going, right?” You are indicating that this is a question, not just a statement.

Martha says, “Teaching you to dance? I'm sure you'r e selling yourself short.” Martha doesn't think teaching Arthur to dance is an  impossible task. She says, “I'm sure” – I'm confident – you are “selling yourself short.” “To sell yourself short” is a phrasal verb meaning to underestimate your abi lities, to believe that you can't do something that you really can.

Arthur says, “No, really, I have two left feet.” Th is is an old expression. “To have two left feet” means that you are a very bad dancer , that you can't dance very well. Of course, everyone – or most people – have a  left foot and a right foot. If you had two feet that were both left feet, well, yo u probably couldn't walk or dance very well. That's what the expression is sayi ng here.

Arthur says, “I'm completely uncoordinated and have  no sense of rhythm.” “To be uncoordinated” is to be not coordinated. “To be coo rdinated,” then, means to be able to use your body in a way that allows you to b e graceful, to do what you want to do with your body. An athlete, for example,  has to be very coordinated. They have to be able to use their arms and legs and  body together in such a way as to be able to do what they need to do in their s port. Here, Arthur is saying he is “uncoordinated,” meaning he's not able to use his body to do what he would need to do to be a dancer.

He says also that he has “no sense of rhythm.” “To have a sense (sense) of” something means to know about something or to have the ability to do something. “Rhythm” (rhythm) is the regular strong points in a song, what we would call the “beats.” Your ability to feel the be ats is a “sense of rhythm.”

For example, a “waltz,” a formal dance – the rhythm  might be ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three, and in a different ki nd of dance it may be ONE- two-three-four, ONE-two-three-four, or one-TWO-thre e-FOUR, one-TWO-three-

FOUR. There are different accents, different strong  points in the music. Having a sense of rhythm is important in dancing, because yo u have to be able to dance according to the rhythm of the song.

Arthur says, “I'm just not cut out for dancing.” the expression “to be cut out for” something means that you are qualified to do someth ing or you are prepared to do something. It can also mean that you have the na tural ability to do something. I am not cut out for camping. It's not something th at I like to do, and it's not something that I want to learn to do, because I don 't think I would be very good at it. I'm not cut out for camping. Arthur is not cut out for dancing.

But Martha says, “Let's not get ahead of ourselves. ” “To get ahead of yourself” means to worry about things that will happen in the  future before you should be worrying about them. It can also mean that you are focusing on what is going to happen later, rather than what you should be doing now. “To get ahead of yourself” would be, for example, to plan your weddi ng before you actually have met anyone to marry. That would be “getting ahead of yourself.” Although I understand many women do that anyway.

Martha says, “We’ll just start by loosening up and swaying to the music.” “To loosen up” is a phrasal verb meaning to relax, to a llow your body and the muscles in your body to be relaxed, not to be tense . “Sway” (sway) means to move back and forth – once again, to the rhythm or the beat of the music. So, Martha is suggesting that they just relax and move back and forth with the music before they actually start dancing. She says, “You don't even need to swing your hips yet.” “To swing (swing) your hips (hips)” mean s to move your hips back and forth. Your “hips” are the part of your body on the  side of your body, where your leg meets the rest of your body, basically.

Arthur says, “That's good, because I don't think I can learn even the simplest dance steps.” “Dance steps” are the individual move ments or parts of a dance. Martha says, “Not only will I teach you some useful  dance steps, we’ll put together a dance routine down the line.” A “dance r outine” (routine) is a whole series of dance steps that you memorize and are abl e to perform. “Down the line” is an expression meaning later – in the future or e ventually. “Down the line, I hope to retire to Hawaii” – someday in the future. I do . . . maybe someday.

Arthur doesn't believe Martha. He says, “That seems  like a pipe dream to me.” A “pipe (pipe) dream” is a dream about something you want to achieve in the future that is impossible, that will never happen, that is  not something that you will be able to do. That's a “pipe dream.” Martha says, “No nsense,” meaning, “You are wrong. I don't believe what you're saying.” “Nonsen se. Before long” – meaning

soon – “dancing to you will be as effortless as bre athing.” “Something that is “effortless” (effortless) is very easy. You can do it without trying.

Arthur says, “But until then, I'll look and feel li ke a dancing hippo.” Arthur is making a joke here. He says until he learns to danc e, he will look like a hippo that is dancing. A “hippo” (hippo) is short for hippopot amus, which is a large animal with very short legs and a big belly and a big head  that would, of course, look rather funny if it were to dance.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Arthur: You know that you’ve taken on an impossible  task, right?

Martha: Teaching you to dance? I’m sure you’re sell ing yourself short.

Arthur: No, really, I have two left feet. I’m compl etely uncoordinated and have no sense of rhythm. I’m just not cut out for dancing.

Martha: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll jus t start by loosening up and swaying to the music. You don’t even need to swing your hips yet.

# Recovering After a Setback

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 962 – Recovering After a Setback.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Carl and Shelly about someone who’s had some bad luck and is trying to re cover. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Come on, let’s go. I have $500 burning a hole  in my pocket.

Shelly: Where are we going?

Carl: We’re going to the track. I have a tip on a s ure thing for one of this afternoon’s races. This is exactly what I need afte r last week’s setback.

Shelly: You mean after losing all of your money las t week.

Carl: Right, but all I need to do is to get that mo nkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune. Winning big this aftern oon will be the start of a new winning streak.

Shelly: Maybe what happened last week is really a s ign of things to come. Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.

Carl: Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity. I ’ve always believed that when you meet with a setback, come back with all you’ve got.

Shelly: Does that mean what I think it means?

Carl: Yes, that’s right. I’m plunking down all $500  on that race. I can’t lose.

Shelly: But what if –

 Carl: Don’t say another word. When I win and get ba ck in my stride, you can say, “Congratulations!”

[end of dialogue]

Carl begins our dialogue by saying, “Come on, let’s  go. I have $500 burning a hole in my pocket.” “Come on” means “Let’s move. Le t’s leave” – in this case, “Let’s go.” Carl and Shelly are going somewhere. It  seems as though they’re going to gamble to try to win money by doing some s ort of gambling. Carl says he has “$500 burning a hole in his pocket.” “To hav e money burning a hole (hole) in your pocket (pocket)” means to have some money t hat you want to spend and spend quickly, especially if it’s cash – if it’s pa per money or coins.

Literally, your “pocket” is where you keep your key s and your money in your pants. Most pairs of pants have at least two pocket s, one on each side. You’ll often have pockets in the back of the pants – to pu t a wallet, for example – at least, most men’s pants have a pocket in the back. “To burn a hole in your pocket” would mean that the money in your pocket wo uld fall out. It would fall out through the hole that was burned by the money. It’s  just an expression that we use when we have some money and we really want to g o out and spend it, often spend it on things that aren’t very important or th ings that are just for fun.

Shelly says, “Where are we going?” Carl says, “We’r e going to the track.” The “track” (track) here means the racetrack, a place w here horses or dogs run around an oval-shaped path. You could also have a t rack for runners. In the Olympics, for example, there are races that go arou nd the track. It’s like a large circle, but in the shape of an oval. Carl wants to go to the racetrack to bet money so he can win more money.

Carl says, “I have a tip on a sure thing for one of  this afternoon’s races.” A “tip” (tip) here means some secret information that was g iven him that would give him some advantage in, in this case, winning money at the racetrack. Perhaps somebody who knows the horse or knows the person ri ding the horse – we call that person a “jockey” – gave this information to C arl. A “sure thing” is something you know will definitely happen. It’s guaranteed. I t doesn’t involve any risk. It will 100 percent, for certain happen. Carl thinks that t his horse – or dog, we’re not sure which – will definitely win the race, and so b y betting on that horse or dog, Carl is sure that he will win.

“Races” are competitions – in this case, a race wit h different animals. Carl says, “This is exactly what I need after last week’s setb ack.” A “setback” (setback) is

when you’re having good luck, or things are going w ell for you, and then suddenly something bad happens – something happens that delays or slows your progress. But you know it’s only temporary. Yo u’re not worried about it.

A setback is a small, typically temporary problem t hat you think will go away, and in the very near future you will continue to be suc cessful. That term is also sometimes used when someone is sick, especially in a hospital or with some illness or disease that lasts a long time. Someone may be getting better, and then they have a setback. They stopped getting bett er. They get a little worse.

Shelly says, “You mean after losing all of your money last week?” Carl’s setback was that he lost all of his money, at least all of the money he was gambling. Carl says, “Right,” meaning yes. “But all I need to do is to get that monkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune.” The expr ession “to have a monkey (monkey) on your back” means that you have a seriou s problem that lasts a long time and is very difficult to resolve, or solve. “T o have a monkey on your back” is to have a problem that lasts for a long time. It is  been with you for a long time. Carl says that he has a monkey on his back, and so he wants to get the monkey off his back. “To have a monkey on your back” is to  have a problem. “To get a monkey off your back” is to get rid of the problem.

Carl says if this happens – if he can get rid of th is bad luck, basically – he’ll have a “reversal of fortune.” “Fortune” (fortune) means something very good, often a lot of money. We talk about someone “making a fortu ne in the stock market” – we mean this person made a lot of money in the stock m arket. A “reversal” (reversal) is when something changes, something changes comple tely, so that instead of winning, you are losing – or, instead of losing, yo u are winning. That would be a reversal. A “reversal of fortune” would be a change  in your luck – suddenly, things are going well for you instead of poorly for  you.

Carl thinks his luck is going to change. He says, “ Winning big” – meaning winning a lot of money – “this afternoon will be the start of a new winning streak.” A “streak” (streak) is a series of things that happen  one after the other. “To have a winning streak” means to be winning each and every competition that you enter. If a baseball team has a winning streak, they are w inning every game, maybe 5 games “in a row (row),” we would say. When somethin g happens consecutively, one after the other, we use the expression “in a ro w.” So, a winning streak might be winning 5 games in a row, or 10 games in a row.

Carl thinks that if he wins big this afternoon, he will be starting a new winning streak. Shelly says, “Maybe what happened last week  is really a sign of things to come.” The expression “a sign (sign) of things to c ome” means that what has

happened in the past will be the same thing that wi ll happen in the future; it will give you an idea about what will happen in the futu re. The fact that Carl lost in the past, according to Shelly, may be a sign of thi ngs to come – that he will continue losing, not that he will have a reversal of fortune. Shelly says, “Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.” Just as you can win several games in a row, or several competitions, so you can lose several games  or competitions in a row, and that’s what Shelly is saying here.

Carl says, “Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativ ity.” “To jinx” (jinx) someone means to bring bad luck to someone – to do somethin g or say something that will cause problems for other people. People who are sup erstitious, or who believe in bad luck, worry about other people jinxing their pr ojects – somehow causing them to have bad luck by something that they say, u sually something negative. And that’s why Carl says, “Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity.” “Negativity” is the idea of being pessimistic, of thinking that things will go poorly in the future.

Carl says, “I’ve always believed that when you meet  with a setback” – when you have some difficulty – “come back with all you’ve g ot,” meaning you should respond with all of your energy, with full effort. Shelly says, “Does that mean what I think it means?” Carl says, “Yes, that’s rig ht. I’m plunking down all $500 on that race.” “To plunk (plunk) down” means to spend a lot of money on something. “I’m going to plunk down $500 on a new iPad.” Well,  I’m not, but that’s an example. “I’m going to plunk down a thousand dollar s to buy my beautiful wife a new ring.” I’m not going to do that, either.

Carl says, “I can’t lose.” Shelly says, “But what i f?” and then Carl interrupts her. Carl says, “Don’t say another word. When I win and get back in my stride, you can say ‘Congratulations.’” “To get back in your st ride” or “into your stride” (stride) means to return to doing something well af ter a period of not doing it well – to start having success after you’ve had several failures. Carl thinks he’s going to win at the racetrack today and doesn’t want Shel ly to bring him any bad luck.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Come on, let’s go. I have $500 burning a hole  in my pocket.

Shelly: Where are we going?

Carl: We’re going to the track. I have a tip on a s ure thing for one of this afternoon’s races. This is exactly what I need afte r last week’s setback.

 Shelly: You mean after losing all of your money las t week.

Carl: Right, but all I need to do is to get that mo nkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune. Winning big this aftern oon will be the start of a new winning streak.

Shelly: Maybe what happened last week is really a s ign of things to come. Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.

Carl: Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity. I ’ve always believed that when you meet with a setback, come back with all you’ve got.

Shelly: Does that mean what I think it means?

# Admiring a Baby

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 963 – Admiring a Baby.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 963. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Maya and Jean-Paul about looking at a little baby. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maya: Isn’t this baby precious? She is just darling . Coo chi coo.

Jean-Paul: Why do women fawn over babies? One baby looks pretty much like any other.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you’d ever spent tim e with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her fac e is so expressive. Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?

Jean-Paul: I’m not wasting my time looking at a lit tle brat. Let’s go.

Maya: Wait, she’s smiling. Come look!

Jean-Paul: She has gas and needs to be burped. I do n’t even need to look at her to know that.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her fa ce. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest temperament .

Jean-Paul: Whatever.

Maya: Just come over here and look at her.

Jean-Paul: You’re not going to let me leave without  looking at her, are you?

 Maya: I think you’ll find her just as lovable and a dorable as I do.

Jean-Paul: All right, let’s take a look at this pre cious darling of an angel with an expressive face.

Maya: See what I mean?

Jean-Paul: She is, well, kind of cute and cuddly.

Maya: When you see her don’t you just want to . . .

Jean-Paul: Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.

[end of dialogue]

Maya begins our dialogue by saying, “Isn’t this bab y precious?” When we describe a baby as “precious” (precious), we mean it’s very beautiful. We could use that to describe a person such as a cute baby. We could also use that to describe a piece of art, for example, or something that is very beautiful or very beautifully made. Maya says, “She is just darling.”  “Darling” (darling) is another one of those words we would use to describe a beaut iful baby. Someone who is “darling” is someone who is very cute, very beautif ul.

Then Maya uses an expression that we sometimes use in talking to little babies. She says, “Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.” “Coo chi coo”  aren’t real words in English. They’re just words we use with a very high pitched sound – as I did in the example – that we use in talking to babies to get their attention, perhaps. I’m not sure where we came up with that phrase, “Coo chi co o,” but it is one that people use when communicating with a little baby.

Jean-Paul says, “Why do women fawn over babies?” “T o fawn (fawn) over” someone is to give someone a lot of attention, to g ive someone a lot of praise, to say nice things about a person. It could also, I su ppose, be used in talking about an object as well. We could talk about fawning over  a beautiful painting, saying how wonderful it is. Here, we’re talking about fawn ing over little babies. Jean- Paul says, “One baby looks pretty much like any oth er.” Jean-Paul is saying that most babies look alike, and so there’s no reason to  consider one baby cuter than another, I suppose.

Maya says, “You wouldn’t say that if you ever spent  time with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her fac e is so expressive.” A “doll”

(doll) is normally a little toy that young children , often young girls, play with that looks like a human being. When we use this in descr ibing a baby, we are saying that the baby is very cute. It’s another way of say ing “cute” or “beautiful,” just like we use the words “precious” and “darling.”

Maya says then that the face of the baby is “expres sive” (expressive). “To be expressive” means to show a lot of emotion in the w ay that you move your face or move your hands, or move your body – to express your emotions is to be expressive. Then Maya turns to the baby and says, “ Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?” Jean-Paul says, “I’m not wasting my time look ing at a little brat. Let’s go.” A “brat” (brat) is a child who behaves very badly.

We might also use the adjective “spoiled” (spoiled) . A “spoiled” child is a child who always gets what he wants, and if he doesn’t ge t what he wants, he cries or screams or does something to make his parents give him what he wants. It’s usually a bad idea, although there are many parents  who treat their children that way. My parents never treated me that way. When you  are the youngest of 11 children, you’re never going to get everything you want, although my older brothers and sisters say that because I was the you ngest, I did get everything I want, but believe me, that’s not true. Just ask me.

Jean-Paul says that he’s not going to waste his tim e looking at this little brat. Maya says, “Wait, she’s smiling. Come look,” meanin g come over and look at the baby. Jean-Paul, however, is still not convinced. H e says, “She has gas and needs to be burped. I don’t even need to look at he r to know that.” When we say a little baby has “gas” (gas), we mean they have ai r trapped inside their body that may make them feel uncomfortable.

What you do with little babies, I’m told, is pick them up and put them on your shoulder, and then you tap them lightly, perhaps, o n the back. This will help them “burp” (burp). “To burp” means to release that gas,  that air in your stomach, out through your mouth. “To be burped” would mean to ha ve the baby on your shoulder and helping it burp out that gas, get rid of that air inside his stomach. Jean-Paul says that he doesn’t even need to look at  her to know that. He knows that that’s what is happening here.

Maya says, “You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her face. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest tem perament.” “Angelic” (angelic) comes from the noun “angel” (angel). In t his case, it means a very beautiful, peaceful look. Maya says she has the swe etest “temperament” (temperament). Your “temperament” is how you normal ly react to something – your characteristics and moods. “To have a sweet te mperament” would be to be

happy, to always be peaceful, to be smiling. That’s  what this little baby has, according to Maya.

Jean-Paul says, “Whatever.” We use that expression very commonly now in English – informally – to mean, “Oh, okay, I’m not going to pay attention to that anymore,” or “I don’t think that’s very important,”  or “I am not interested in that.” There are lots of ways of using that expression, “W hatever.” The important part is the way you say it. You don’t say, “Whatever.” You say, “Whatever,” or “Whatever.” You have a certain intonation in your v oice that indicates that you’re bored, or you’re uninterested, or perhaps you don’t  want to talk about something anymore.

Maya says, “Just come over here and look at her.” J ean-Paul says, “You’re not going to let me leave without looking at her, are y ou?” Jean-Paul knows that they won’t be able to leave unless he goes over and look s at the baby. Maya says, “I think you’ll find her just as lovable and adorable as I do.” “To be lovable” (lovable) means to be easy to love, especially because someon e is good, kind, and beautiful. “Adorable” (adorable) is another adjecti ve for pretty, beautiful, attractive, lovely.

Jean-Paul says, “All right, let’s take a look at th is precious darling of an angel.” And here, he’s sort of making fun of Maya’s previou s descriptions, with an expressive face. Maya says, “See what I mean?” Jean -Paul, now that he’s looking at the baby, says, “She is, well, kind of c ute and cuddly.” “To be cute” (cute) is to be attractive, especially in a young, childlike way. “To be cuddly” (cuddly) is to have qualities that make you want to  pick up, in this case, the baby or child and put him in your arms because it feels good to hug him.

Then Maya says, “When you see her don’t you just wa nt to,” and Jean-Paul interrupts her with the same expression that Maya u sed at the beginning of the dialogue, that we use with young babies: “Coo chi c oo. Coo chi coo.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Maya: Isn’t this baby precious? She is just darling . Coo chi coo.

Jean-Paul: Why do women fawn over babies? One baby looks pretty much like any other.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you’d ever spent tim e with babies. Come over here and look at this one. She’s a doll and her fac e is so expressive. Aren’t you a little doll? Aren’t you?

Jean-Paul: I’m not wasting my time looking at a lit tle brat. Let’s go.

Maya: Wait, she’s smiling. Come look!

Jean-Paul: She has gas and needs to be burped. I do n’t even need to look at her to know that.

Maya: You wouldn’t say that if you looked at her fa ce. She has the most angelic expression on her face and the sweetest temperament .

Jean-Paul: Whatever.

Maya: Just come over here and look at her.

Jean-Paul: You’re not going to let me leave without  looking at her, are you?

Maya: I think you’ll find her just as lovable and a dorable as I do.

Jean-Paul: All right, let’s take a look at this pre cious darling of an angel with an expressive face.

Maya: See what I mean?

Jean-Paul: She is, well, kind of cute and cuddly.

Maya: When you see her don’t you just want to . . .

Jean-Paul: Coo chi coo. Coo chi coo.

# Using Infographics

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 964 – Using Infographics.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 964. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

How are you today? I’m fine, thank you. Our website  is also fine. You can find it at ESLPod.com. Go there, become a member, and downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode. You can also like us on Facebook at facebook.com/eslpod.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Mario and Cleo about using visuals to convey, or give people, informatio n. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mario: That’s a lot of text in your proposal. Are y ou sure people are going to take the time to read all of that?

Cleo: It’s a complex proposal with a lot of moving parts. I can’t simplify it without leaving out essentials.

Mario: What you need are infographics. You can enca psulate and communicate a lot of information by using visuals.

Cleo: This is a serious business proposal. I want p eople to take it seriously, and I don’t want them to get distracted by a lot of color  pictures.

Mario: That’s precisely why you have to use infogra phics. Look at these reports and proposals I’ve received in the past year. Every body is communicating complex sets of information and statistics in maps and graphics. You can even show hierarchies and networks easily using infograp hics.

Cleo: I didn’t know it could be done in such a prof essional way, but I don’t know the first thing about creating infographics.

Mario: Lucky for you, I know an expert.

Cleo: Who?

Mario: Someone who is enormously talented, but unde rappreciated.

Cleo: I don’t think I know anyone like that.

Mario: Hmph!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Mario saying to Cleo, “Tha t’s a lot of text in your proposal.” “Text” (text) here means written words –  not images, not photos, not pictures – just the actual words of whatever you’re  writing. Mario says there’s “a lot of text in your proposal.” The “proposal” is wh en you are trying to get someone to approve of your ideas to do something. M ario says, “Are you sure people are going to take the time to read all of th at?” “To take the time” to do something is to spend the time to do something so t hat you do it correctly, or you do it properly, or you do it thoroughly – completel y.

Cleo says, “It’s a complex proposal with a lot of m oving parts.” “Complex” (complex) means complicated, difficult to understan d, not easy to follow. “Moving parts” refers to the different parts of any sort of  activity. “Parts” here refers to the different things that are required for this particu lar activity to take place or to be successful. It’s a very general term used to descri be different aspects or different areas of a project.

If you have a lot of “moving parts,” you have a lot  of things that change and that change other things in your project. If this person  does their job well, then that helps the other person; or, if this happens, then t hat will mean something else will happen. All of these things are related to each oth er, and you have to try to coordinate them, to get them to work together. What  Cleo is saying is that it’s a very complicated proposal. You’ll hear that express ion, “a lot of moving parts,” when someone is talking about something that is ver y complicated.

Cleo says, “I can’t simplify it without leaving out  essentials.” “To simplify” (simplify) means to make something simpler, make so mething easier. “Essentials” (essentials) are things that are neces sary for a certain activity or project – things that you absolutely must have. Foo d and water are essential if you are going to live; so is oxygen, so are a lot of other things. These are “essentials.” Cleo says that she doesn’t want to le ave out, or not include, essentials in her proposal. That’s why it’s so comp licated.

Mario says, “What you need are infographics.” An “i nfographic” (infographic) is a graphic or visual representation of information. It  may be representing things as a

process. It may be showing the different parts of s omething. All of those would be considered “infographics.” The word “infographics” comes from “information” and “graphics,” which are visuals. So, an infographic is a visual that helps people understand complicated information.

Mario says, “You can encapsulate and communicate a lot of information by using visuals.” “To encapsulate” (encapsulate) means to s ummarize, to include. “To encapsulate” would be to give someone a brief versi on of the information, but in a way that communicates or gets them all of the inf ormation they need to understand it.

“Visuals” (visuals) are things that you can see, su ch as an image or a photograph or a graphic. Usually when you see the word “visual s,” someone is using that to distinguish it from text. The word “text,” as we po inted out, refers to words. “Visuals” refers to everything else, really, that y ou would look at on a piece of paper, that would be communicating information to y ou.

Cleo says, “This is a serious business proposal. I want people to take it seriously.” “To take it seriously” means to conside r it in a serious way. She says, “I don’t want them to get distracted by a lot of co lor pictures.” “To be distracted (distracted) by” something means to have your atten tion taken away from an important thing because something else, either impo rtant or interesting, is happening.

Many people nowadays get “distracted” by email at w ork. They’re working on a project, and they have their email program open on their computer, and they hear a new message come in and they go, “Oh, I have to g o check that message right away.” And that message distracts them from their r eal work, their important work, which is what they were doing before they got  distracted.

Cleo thinks that putting in infographics will distr act the readers of her proposal. She uses the term “a lot of color pictures,” which is meant to indicate that it might look nice, but it’s not very important, or doesn’t convey or give any important information. Mario says, “That’s precisely why you have to use infographics. Look at these reports and proposals I’ve received in the  past year. Everybody is communicating complex sets of information and stati stics in maps and graphics.”

“Statistics” refers to information in a numerical f orm. In everyday English, it could be something as simple as the percentage of people in a certain category, or something much more complicated. Mario says that pe ople are communicating or trying to give information about very complicate d sets of information in maps

and graphics. A “map” is, of course, a drawing that  shows you where something is. “Graphics” is another word for “images” or “vis uals.”

Mario says, “You can even show hierarchies and netw orks easily using infographics.” A “hierarchy” (hierarchy) in this ca se is a chart that shows the relationships among different people in a group. Yo u might have a chart or graphic that shows the president on the top, and th en the vice presidents below him, and then the managers below the vice president s, and so forth. That would show the hierarchy, the ranking of the people in th at company – who is the most powerful, who’s the second most powerful, and so forth.

Mario says, “You can show hierarchies and networks. ” “Networks” (networks) are systems of people or things, especially when we’re talking about computers that are connected and related to each other. Cleo says,  “I didn’t know it could be done in such a professional way, but I don’t know the first thing about creating infographics.” The expression “to not know the firs t thing about” something means you are completely unfamiliar with something.  You don’t have any idea about how to do this.

Mario says, “Lucky for you, I know an expert.” Cleo  says, “Who?” Mario says, “Someone who is enormously talented, but underappre ciated.” “To be enormously talented” means to be very talented, to have a lot of expertise in something. “To be appreciated” means that people kn ow that you do a good job, and they understand that and recognize that. “To be  underappreciated” means that people don’t completely or fully recognize all  that you do. You don’t receive enough credit for what you do.

Cleo says, “I don’t think I know anyone like that.”  Obviously, Mario is not happy at the end of the dialogue. He says, “Hmph!” Of course , Mario is the person that Mario is talking about – he is the person who is en ormously talented when it comes to or related to creating infographics.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mario: That’s a lot of text in your proposal. Are y ou sure people are going to take the time to read all of that?

Cleo: It’s a complex proposal with a lot of moving parts. I can’t simplify it without leaving out essentials.

Mario: What you need are infographics. You can enca psulate and communicate a lot of information by using visuals.

# Meeting Your Boyfriend¡¦s/Girlfriend¡¦s Parents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 965 – Meeting Your Boyfriend’s/Girlfriend’s Parents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 965. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast by going to our website. While you’re there, take a look at our ESL  Podcast Blog and our ESL Podcast Store.

This episode is a dialogue between Ronny and Judy a bout meeting the parents of your boyfriend or girlfriend – always a interest ing experience. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ronny: Ready?

Judy: Ready as I’ll ever be.

Ronny: Try to work up a little enthusiasm about mee ting my parents.

Judy: It’s not them I’m worried about. It’s me. Wha t if I don’t pass muster?

Ronny: My parents are going to love you. They’re op en-minded and nonjudgmental people. They won’t care about anythin g except that I like you and you make me happy.

Judy: Me and parents are like oil and water. I’ve n ever been good at making a good first impression.

Ronny: Then you’ll gradually win them over. Meeting  my parents will be a cakewalk. They’re nice people. It’s not like you’ll  be running the gauntlet meeting my nine brothers.

Judy: You didn’t tell them I’d be meeting your pare nts tonight, did you?

Ronny: I may have mentioned it to Mark. Why?

Judy: What if they decide to show up and ambush me?

 Ronny: They won’t.

Judy: If you found out that one of your brothers we re bringing a girlfriend home to meet your parents, wouldn’t you want to be there?

Ronny: You have a point there, but it’s too late to  back out now. Put on your game face and let’s go, or we’ll be late.

Judy: Okay, but just don’t be surprised if I make a  break for it.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ronny asking Judy if she is ready. He simply says the word “Ready?” – meaning “Are you ready?” Judy says,  “Ready as I’ll ever be.” When you say you are ready as you’ll ever be, you m ean that you don’t feel very confident about doing something, but you have done as much preparation as you can. You are as prepared as possible. Judy says, “R eady as I’ll ever be.”

Ronny says, “Try to work up a little enthusiasm abo ut meeting my parents.” “To work up” is a phrasal verb which here means to crea te a feeling or an emotion – basically, to get excited about something. “Enthusi asm” is excitement, interest in something. Ronny is asking Judy to work up a little  enthusiasm about meeting his parents.

Judy says, “It’s not them I’m worried about.” She’s  not worried about Ronny’s parents. She says, “It’s me. What if I don’t pass m uster?” The expression “to pass muster” (muster) means to be acceptable, to me et the minimum requirements or expectations about something. To be  good enough for something is “to pass muster.”

Judy is worried that she won’t be good enough for R onny’s parents. This, as anyone who has ever met the parents of one’s new bo yfriend or girlfriend knows, is a very legitimate and logical concern. Parents o ften think that the person their son or daughter has chosen as a boyfriend or girlfr iend is not good enough for their own child. Actually, when my girlfriend, now wife, first met my parents, my parents didn’t think I was good enough for her – wh ich, of course, is completely true.

Ronny says, “My parents are going to love you. They ’re open-minded and nonjudgmental people.” “To be open-minded” means to  be willing to accept and consider new ideas. “To be nonjudgmental” means to be not judgmental. “To be

judgmental” (judgmental) means to be very critical about someone or something, to think something is very bad, or to consider some thing in a very negative light. “To be judgmental” usually means to be disapproving  of someone in a way that is considered extreme or not very nice.

“Nonjudgmental” would be the opposite of that. That ’s what Ronny says his parents are – they’re “nonjudgmental.” “They won’t care about anything except that I like you and you make me happy.” If that’s t rue, Ronny doesn’t have a very good pair of parents, does he? Parents should be co ncerned about more than whether the person likes them. No intelligent paren t would take a look at their daughter’s new boyfriend and, after discovering tha the is a murderer and a thief, say “Oh, well, that’s not important as long as he m akes you happy.” Well, maybe some parents are like that. I don’t know.

Judy says, “Me and parents are like oil and water.”  Notice she says “me” instead of “I,” which would be the grammatically correct wa y of saying that. But in informal conversation, we would just say “me” – “me  and parents.” She’s referring here to the fact that when she meets pare nts of her boyfriends – we don’t know how many boyfriends she’s had, but appar ently she had had bad experiences with the parents of her previous boyfri ends.

That’s why she says, “Me and parents are like oil a nd water.” “Oil” and “water” don’t mix together. They stay separate. The idea be hind this phrase or expression is that you don’t get along with other p eople. If you say these two people “are like oil and water,” you’re saying that  they don’t get along with each other. They don’t have a good relationship.

Judy says, “I’ve never been good at making a good f irst impression.” Your “first impression” is the first time that you meet someone , the first time that you have a chance to see someone. Your first impression is you r first encounter, your first meeting. We talk about “making a good first impress ion” because many people are unable to change their minds after they get an idea about what you are like. So, if the first time they meet you, you do somethi ng that makes them not like you, they may not like you again in the future, eve n though you may change your behavior and do other things.

So, making a good first impression is considered a good idea because people often keep their first impression and don’t change their minds, even though the person may act differently in the future. Ronny say s, “Then you’ll gradually win them over.” “To win someone over” is to persuade or  convince someone to like you, to have a good impression of you, a good opini on of you. The word “gradually” (gradually) means slowly, over a long p eriod of time.

 Ronny says, “Meeting my parents will be a cakewalk. ” The term “cakewalk” (cakewalk) – one word – means something that is ver y easy to do. He says his parents are nice people. “It’s not like you’ll be r unning the gauntlet meeting my nine brothers.” “To run the gauntlet” (gauntlet) he re means to experience a lot of problems, especially from a group of people, each of whom may give you problems. We learned that Ronny has nine brothers, which is, of course, a very large family. I only have eight brothers, so I come  from a much smaller family than Ronny.

Judy says, “You didn’t tell them” – meaning his bro thers – “I’d be meeting your parents tonight, did you?” Ronny says, “I may have mentioned it to Mark. Why?” Judy says, “What if they” – Ronny’s brothers – “dec ide to show up and ambush me.” “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb that h ere means to appear, often unexpectedly, when people weren’t expecting you to be there.

“To ambush” (ambush) someone means to attack them u nexpectedly. A surprise attack is an “ambush.” Usually, we think about seve ral people attacking one person, or a large group attacking a small group, u nexpectedly. Ronny says, “They won’t” – they won’t show up.

Judy says, “If you found out” – if you discovered –  “that one of your brothers were bringing a girlfriend home to meet your parents, wo uldn’t you want to be there?” Judy doubts that Ronny is correct about his brother  not being there, because if Ronny were in the same situation – finding out one of his brothers was bringing home a new girlfriend for the first time to meet the parents – he would definitely want to be there. Ronny says, “You have a point the re,” meaning, “Yes, I agree with what you say.” “But it’s too late to back out now.” “To back out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to change your mind – to decid e not to do something that you said you were going to do.

Ronny says, “Put on your game face and let’s go, or  we’ll be late.” “To put on your game face” is an expression meaning hide your emotions, or make yourself look stronger or more prepared than what you really  are. Your “game face” would be the facial expression, literally, that you have during some sort of competition. You don’t want the other person to think that you a re scared or weak, so you put on your “game face.”

Judy says, “Okay, but just don’t be surprised if I make a break for it.” The expression “to make a break (break) for it” means to leave unexpectedly and very quickly when you no longer want to be in a certain situation. If you are trying to

escape someone, for example, you might use this exp ression: “Let’s make a break for it” – let’s try to escape from this situa tion.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ronny: Ready?

Judy: Ready as I’ll ever be.

Ronny: Try to work up a little enthusiasm about mee ting my parents.

Judy: It’s not them I’m worried about. It’s me. Wha t if I don’t pass muster?

Ronny: My parents are going to love you. They’re op en-minded and nonjudgmental people. They won’t care about anythin g except that I like you and you make me happy.

I’ll be back around eight o’clock.  Marcelo: Hey, where are you going in such a hurry?  Debbie: I’m going to my religious education class.   Marcelo: Religious education class? What’s that about?  Debbie: Well, I’ve decided to convert to McQuillanism.   Marcelo: I’m not familiar with that denomination. It is Christian, isn’t it?  Debbie: No, it isn’t, but there are some similarities in the spiritual teachings between McQuillanism and Christianity, but we have different ways of worshiping – different prayers, hymns, and rituals.  Marcelo: It doesn’t sound legit. Are you sure McQuillanism isn’t really a cult?  Debbie: Of course not. My spiritual leader has been tutoring me on the tenets of the faith so I understand it, but I can see why you’d question it, since you don’t know anything about it.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 967 – Feeling Embarrassed.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Lois and Roger about being embarrassed. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lois: Please don’t embarrass me at the party tonigh t.

Roger: Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.

Lois: You have, though, more than once.

Roger: Name one.

Lois: At the Johnsons’ party, you danced on the tab le while singing “I Am Woman”!

Roger: I was being the life of the party. Everybody  thought it was funny.

Lois: It was humiliating! Didn’t you notice more th an one person cringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?

Roger: No, I didn’t, but I did notice Malik laughin g his head off and the Johnsons smiling.

Lois: That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johnsons were humoring you. They were trying to put a good face o n your impromptu performance.

Roger: I’m not going to be a wallflower just becaus e you can’t take a joke. My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so  many parties.

Lois: Yeah, right. Can I at least get you to promis e not to sing?

Roger: And disappoint my audience? Not a chance!

[end of dialogue] Lois begins by saying to Roger, “Please don’t embar rass me at the party tonight.” “To embarrass” (embarrass) someone means to make so meone feel uncomfortable, to make them feel, perhaps, self-con scious. Lois is asking Roger not to embarrass her at the party tonight. Roger sa ys, “Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.” Notice Roger says “me” instead of “ I.” In informal English, in situations like this, we often use “me” instead of “I,” even though “I” is the grammatically correct form. Lois says, “You have, t hough, more than once,” meaning you have, in fact, embarrassed me more than  one time.

Roger says, “Name one,” meaning give me a specific example. Lois then gives him a specific example. She says, “At the Johnsons’  party, you danced on the table while singing ‘I Am Woman’!” The Johnsons are  probably friends of Roger and Lois. At the party that was held at the Johnson s’ house, Roger got up on top of a table and started dancing and singing the song  “I Am Woman.” “I Am Woman” is a song from the 1970s by, I believe, Hele n Reddy.

“I am woman, hear me roar, In number’s too big to ignore . . . Dah dah dah dah dah dah Dah dah dah dah dah daaaah dah”

I really don’t know this song since I am not a woma n.

Roger says, “I was being the life of the party.” Th at expression, “the life of the party,” means the person who is always very enterta ining, someone who is always making jokes, perhaps. Roger says, “Everybod y thought it was funny.” Lois disagrees. She says, “It was humiliating.” “Hu miliating” (humiliating) is something that is very embarrassing, extremely emba rrassing – something that makes you feel ashamed in front of other people, so mething that makes you feel really bad in front of other people. Lois thought t hat Roger’s singing was humiliating.

She says, “Didn’t you notice more than one person c ringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?” “To crin ge” (cringe) means to have

a very negative feeling caused by being embarrassed  when someone does something unpleasant or difficult to watch. If your  friend is doing something very badly, like singing or dancing, you might cringe. You might feel embarrassed for that person because they’re doing something that is  very embarrassing. Lois says there were people “cringing” at Roger’s perfor mance – his singing and dancing – and there was an “awkward silence in the room” when his song ended.

“Silence” is the absence of noise – when it is comp letely quiet. “Awkward” (awkward) is something that is uncomfortable, somet hing that people don’t like, often in a certain situation. An “awkward silence” would be when people don’t say anything when you would expect them to say somethin g. So, for example, if your friend sees you at a bar and you’re with your frien d’s girlfriend, he might come up to you and not say anything. There would be a very awkward silence. He might hit you, but the situation would certainly be consi dered awkward.

Roger says, “No, I didn’t,” meaning no, I didn’t no tice; I didn’t see people cringing or notice the awkward silence. “I did notice Malik laughing his head off and the Johnsons smiling.” “To laugh your head off” is to l augh very loudly for a long period of time because you think something is very,  very funny. Lois says, “That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johns ons were humoring you.” The phrase “sense (sense) of humor (humor)” refers to the kinds of things that someone thinks are funny, the kinds of things that someone would laugh at. That’s your “sense of humor.”

Some people laugh at very obvious physical humor or  physical comedy – people falling, people falling down the stairs or falling over. Some people think that’s funny. That’s their “sense of humor.” Other people think other things are funny. Each of us has our own sense of humor, our own set of things that we find funny. Lois explains to Roger that Malik was laughing his head off because he has Roger’s sense of humor.

The Johnsons, however, were humoring Roger. “To hum or” someone, as a verb, means to do or say something to make the other pers on happy or to make sure the other person doesn’t get angry. Usually the ver b is used to indicate that the person is pretending, doesn’t really believe what they’re saying, or perhaps is not trying to cause any problems. So, they’re just agre eing with the other person. If someone is humoring you, they don’t really agree wi th you or they don’t really believe, perhaps, the things they are saying to you , but they don’t want you to get angry or upset. So, they say those things anyway.

Lois says, “They were trying to put a good face on your impromptu performance.” “To put a good face on” something means something s imilar to “to humor

someone.” It means to pretend to be happy or satisf ied with something, to try to be positive about something rather than negative. “ Impromptu” (impromptu) means without any planning. We might also use the w ord “spontaneous.” Something that is “impromptu” is something that you  do that you didn’t plan to do. You just decided to do it suddenly.

Roger says, “I am not going to be a wallflower just  because you can’t take a joke.” A “wallflower” (wallflower) is a person who is very shy, who doesn’t talk to other people, especially at a party or a large gath ering. “To take a joke” means to think something is funny, especially when people are laughing at you. If someone says you “can’t take a joke,” he means that you don ’t think things are funny that everyone else thinks are funny.

Roger says, “My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so many parties.” “Exuberant” (exuberant) means with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. Roger is saying that it is because he is so excitin g and interesting that he and Lois get invited to so many parties. Lois doesn’t b elieve this at all. She says, “Yeah, right.” Notice that even though it sounds as  if she were agreeing with Roger, in fact she is disagreeing with Roger. We kn ow that by the way that she says this expression: “Yeah, right.”

Lois says, “Can I at least get you to promise not to sing?” Roger replies, “And disappoint my audience? Not a chance.” “To disappoi nt” someone is to make someone feel sad by not meeting their expectations – by doing something less than what people thought you would do. Roger says h is “audience” – that is, the people who will watch him sing and dance – would be  disappointed if he didn’t do his thing. That’s why he ends the dialogue by sayin g, “Not a chance,” meaning no way; there is no possibility of that happening –  in this case, of Roger not singing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lois: Please don’t embarrass me at the party tonigh t.

Roger: Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.

Lois: You have, though, more than once.

Roger: Name one.

Lois: At the Johnsons’ party, you danced on the tab le while singing “I Am Woman”!

Roger: I was being the life of the party. Everybody  thought it was funny.

Lois: It was humiliating! Didn’t you notice more th an one person cringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?

Roger: No, I didn’t, but I did notice Malik laughin g his head off and the Johnsons smiling.

Lois: That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johnsons were humoring you. They were trying to put a good face o n your impromptu performance.

Roger: I’m not going to be a wallflower just becaus e you can’t take a joke. My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so  many parties.

Lois: Yeah, right. Can I at least get you to promis e not to sing?

Roger: And disappoint my audience? Not a chance!

# Recording an Outgoing Voice Mail Message

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 968 – Recording an Outgoing Voice Mail Message.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 968. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about recording a message that peop le will hear when they call you on the phone and you don’t answer. Let’s get st arted.  > I hate the sound of my own voice. I always have. Wh en I’m speaking to an audience, I always sound forced and unnatural. So w hen we had to set up our new voice mail system’s outgoing message, it took m e a few tries to get it right.
> “Hello, you’ve reached Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I’ m not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message and I’ll cal l you back as soon as I can. Thank you for calling.”
> No, that wasn’t quite right. I gave it another shot .
> “Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail for Martin Na vra at McQ Corp. I’m in a meeting or away from my desk. Please leave a messag e and I’ll call you back as soon as I can. If your call is urgent, please conta ct Julia Mann at 555-434-3232. Thank you.”
> That seemed okay, but since I was leaving on vacati on next week, I needed to record a temporary outgoing message as well. This is what I came up with:
> “Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail of Martin Nav ra at McQ Corp. I will be on vacation from March 3rd through March 10th. If you need to reach someone immediately, please call Julia Mann at 555-434-3232 , or dial “0” to reach reception. Otherwise, please leave a message and I’ ll return your call when I return. Thank you.”
> Our story begins with Martin saying, “I hate the so und of my own voice.” A lot of people say that. They don’t like to hear themselves  in a recording. The person in our story says that he hates the sound of his own v oice. “I always have,” he says. “When I’m speaking to an audience, I always sound f orced and unnatural.” “Forced” (forced) here means trying to do something  but having difficulty doing it in a natural way. Something that is “forced” is som ething that you know the person is having difficulty doing.

“Unnatural” is the opposite of “natural.” “Natural”  is when you do something without thinking about it so that it seems complete ly normal. “Unnatural” would be something that is somehow not normal. Martin contin ues, “So when we had to set up our new voice mail system’s outgoing message , it took me a few tries to get it right.” “To set up” something, or “to set so mething up,” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get something ready to do s omething, especially if you are using it for the first time. If you buy a new t elevision from a store, and you bring it back to your house or apartment, you have to set it up; you have to connect the cables and get it ready so that you can  use it.

Martin is setting up his new voice mail system’s ou tgoing message. “Voice mail” is the system that records a message when you are n ot there to answer the phone. In the old days, we used to have little answ ering machines with small cassette tapes in them that would record messages. Nowadays, it’s more common that your phone company will set up a “voice  mail box,” they’re called, for you.

Basically, it’s a place on their computers that the y store the messages that people leave for you, and then you can call in and get the messages from the computer that recorded them. This is a system that is quite common in many places, and it is often used in companies so that the employees can receive messages even when they are not answering their pho ne.

Martin is setting up his new voice mail system’s ou tgoing message. Your “outgoing (outgoing) message” is the message that p eople hear when they call you. “Hi. I can’t come to the phone right now. Plea se leave a message and I’ll call you later” – that would be a typical outgoing messa ge on someone’s personal phone. “I can’t come to the phone right now” means I am not able to answer the

phone. Then you tell the person to leave a message and you will call them back later.

In our story, Martin is trying to set up his outgoi ng message, but he says, “It took me a few tries to get it right.” A “try” (try), as a noun, is an attempt – your effort to do something. “Tries” would be trying to do it more  than once – many different attempts. We then hear Martin’s first outgoing mess age, the first one he records:

“Hello, you’ve reached Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I’ m not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message and I’ll cal l you back as soon as I can. Thank you for calling.”

The outgoing message begins by Martin identifying h imself – telling people his name. This is always a good idea in your outgoing m essage, to let people know what your name is so they know that they have reach ed the correct person, that they have gotten the right person for whom they can  leave a message. Martin continues, “I’m not available to take your call.” W hen you say you’re “not available,” you mean you are not able to because yo u are busy doing other things like listening to podcasts or reading your e mail or watching videos of cats on YouTube. You know, important things.

Martin says, “Please leave a message and I’ll call you back as soon as I can.” “Please leave a message” – please give me the infor mation you want to give me, which should include, of course, your name and your  telephone number. “And,” Martin says, “I’ll call you back as soon as I can.”  “To call someone back” means to return their telephone call. They call you, then  you call them. That’s “calling someone back.”

Martin is not satisfied. He doesn’t like his first try at recording his outgoing message. He says that he “gave it another shot.” “T o give something another shot” (shot) means to try something again. “To give  something a shot” means to try it. “To give something another shot” means to t ry it again, especially if you were not able to do it correctly or successfully the first time. Now we hear Martin’s second outgoing message:

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail for Martin Na vra at McQ Corp. I’m in a meeting or away from my desk. Please leave a messag e and I’ll call you back as soon as I can. If your call is urgent, please conta ct Julia Mann at 555-434-3232. Thank you.”

The second message that Martin records is a little different. He says, “You’ve reached the voice mail for Martin Navra” instead of  “You’ve reached Martin

Navra.” This is more correct technically, because i f you’re listening to a recording, you haven’t reached – that is, you haven ’t successfully contacted – Martin Navra. You’ve only reached his voice mail. M artin continues, “I’m in a meeting or away from my desk.” This is a very commo n thing for people to say in their outgoing message. They’re giving you basicall y a reason, an excuse, for why they could not answer your phone call.

“I’m in a meeting,” meaning I’m meeting with other people or I’m away from my desk. “To be away from your desk” means not to be s itting at your desk so you can answer the phone. They’re saying to you that I’ m not just sitting here playing video games and ignoring my phone; I’m actually not  here. Well, that’s what they say, anyway.

Martin continues, “If your call is urgent, please c ontact Julia Mann.” Something that is “urgent” (urgent) is something you need to do right away, something that has to be done immediately. Martin is saying that i f what you are calling me about needs to be acted on immediately, you should call this other person. Here, it’s Julia Mann. And then he gives Julia’s telephon e number. Notice that the telephone number begins “555.”

“555” is often used in American movies and televisi on shows when someone is giving their telephone number because there are no telephone numbers in the United States that begin with “555.” So, you know it’s not a real number when someone says that their phone number is “555.” If y ou come to the United States and you meet a beautiful woman at a bar, and she gi ves you her telephone number and it says “555,” it’s not really her telep hone number. Sorry, dude.

Martin says that his second recording “seemed okay. ” “But since I was leaving on vacation next week,” he says, “I needed to record a  temporary outgoing message as well.” “Temporary” means for a short time. Marti n has to record a special outgoing message for the time when he is going to b e on vacation. He says, “This is what I came up with.” “To come up with” so mething means to invent something or to create something.

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail of Martin Nav ra at McQ Corp. I will be on vacation from March 3rd through March 10th. If you need to reach someone immediately, please call Julia Mann at 555-434-3232 , or dial zero to reach reception. Otherwise, please leave a message and I’ ll return your call when I return. Thank you.”

In this “vacation message,” Martin says, “I’m going  to be on vacation from March 3rd through March 10th. He continues, “If you need to reach someone

immediately . . .” As we mentioned earlier, “to rea ch” someone means to successfully contact someone – to actually talk to the person you are trying to talk to. Martin says that if you need to talk to so meone right now, please call Julia Mann, and then he gives her phone number. “Or,” he says, “dial zero to reach reception.” “To dial” (dial) nowadays means to pres s a number on what’s called a “keypad” for the telephone.

This verb “to dial” comes from telephones as they e xisted many years ago, when I was growing up, that had actual round circles on them called “dials.” A “dial” in general is the front of a watch or a clock that has  numbers on it. Well, in the old days telephones had dials, and you would move the d ial around in a circle in order to call a telephone number. We’ve kept that v erb “to dial” to mean the same thing, but now you don’t actually move your fingers  around on a dial. You simply press a number and it produces an electronic tone.

Martin says in his outgoing message that “you can d ial zero to reach reception.” “Reception” (reception) is usually the area where p eople are greeted in an office building. When you first come into an office, there ’s often someone sitting at a desk who asks your name, and who you are there to s ee, and so forth. In this case, it would be the person who answers general ph one calls for the company. If you dial zero, you will reach someone who works for the company who can then perhaps connect you with another person, or of  whom you can ask questions of, in order to get the information you n eed.

We finish the story by Martin saying, “I was finall y done. The good thing is, whenever I call to retrieve my voice mail messages,  I can bypass my outgoing message.” “To retrieve” (retrieve) means to get som ething – often, to get something back that you used to have. We use this v erb also when we are talking about getting your voice mail messages, hea ring your voice mail messages.

Remember we talked about how phone companies record  your message for you, and then you call them and you can get your message  from their computer. You are “retrieving” your message. You are getting it b ack, if you will. “To bypass” (bypass) is a verb meaning to get to where you want  to go without having to go to a certain place, by using a different route or path  to get to where you want to go. In this case, Martin wants to get to his voice mail  messages so he can bypass his own outgoing message. He doesn’t have to listen to it. He can take a different route to get to his message.

The word “bypass” is most commonly used when we’re talking about driving. It is a road or a freeway that goes around a big city so that you don’t have to go

 through the middle of the city. You can “bypass” the city; you can go around the city to get to where you want to go on the other si de of the city. Martin ends by saying, “With any luck” – that is, if he is lucky –  “I’ll never have to hear my own voice again – ever!”

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I hate the sound of my own voice. I always have. Wh en I’m speaking to an audience, I always sound forced and unnatural. So w hen we had to set up our new voice mail system’s outgoing message, it took m e a few tries to get it right.

“Hello, you’ve reached Martin Navra at McQ Corp. I’ m not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message and I’ll cal l you back as soon as I can. Thank you for calling.”

No, that wasn’t quite right. I gave it another shot .

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail for Martin Na vra at McQ Corp. I’m in a meeting or away from my desk. Please leave a messag e and I’ll call you back as soon as I can. If your call is urgent, please conta ct Julia Mann at 555-434-3232. Thank you.”

That seemed okay, but since I was leaving on vacati on next week, I needed to record a temporary outgoing message as well. This is what I came up with.

“Hello, you’ve reached the voice mail of Martin Nav ra at McQ Corp. I will be on vacation from March 3rd through March 10th. If you need to reach someone immediately, please call Julia Mann at 555-434-3232 , or dial “0” to reach reception. Otherwise, please leave a message and I’ ll return your call when I return. Thank you.”

I was finally done. The good thing is, whenever I c all to retrieve my voice mail messages, I can bypass my outgoing message. With an y luck, I’ll never have to hear my own voice again – ever!

[end of story]

There’s nothing forced or unnatural about the Engli sh used in our dialogues. That’s because they’re written by the wonderful Dr.  Lucy Tse.



# Using Electronics on Airplanes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 969 – Using Electronics on Airplanes.

This episode is a dialogue about using electronic d evices – things like phones and games and computers – on airplanes. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Flight attendant: I’m sorry, sir, but all passenger s need to turn off their portable electronic devices for takeoff, so you’ll need to t urn off your laptop.

Alec: I just need to finish one last email.

Flight attendant: Sir, we can’t take off until you turn that computer off.

Alec: Fine. It’s off. Why all the fuss, anyway?

Flight attendant: It’s regulations. Signals emitted  by electronics may interfere with the plane’s communication systems or navigation.

Alec: All right.

Flight attendant: Sir, you’ll also need to turn off  your tablet computer and your cell phone. Those are also considered portable electroni c devices.

Alec: You’ve got to be kidding me. You mean I have to sit here twiddling my thumbs while I wait for the plane to take off? I th ought the FAA eased up on those regulations.

Flight attendant: I’m afraid not, sir. Please power  down all of your devices so we can proceed with takeoff.

Alec: Okay, fine. What am I suppose to do until we get the all clear to use our electronics again?

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could read a magazine .

Alec: That’s what I was doing on my tablet before y ou made me turn it off.

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could take a flying l eap out the window.

Alec: What did you say?

Flight attendant: I said, “Look at that luggage hea p out the window.”

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the flight attendant talki ng to one of the passengers, named Alec. A “flight attendant” is an employee of the airline who brings you food and things to drink during your flight when you are  traveling in a plane from one place to another. Flight attendants are also respon sible for the safety of the aircraft – to make sure everyone is sitting down wh en the plane takes off and lands, for example. A “passenger” is a person who f lies in an airplane. The flight attendant says to Alec, one of the passengers, “I’m  sorry, sir, but all passengers need to turn off their portable electronic devices for takeoff, so you’ll need to turn off your laptop.”

A “portable electronic device” is something that yo u can bring from one place to another, something that is small and easily moved. A “device” (device) is a small piece of equipment, often an electronic piece of eq uipment. “Electronic” refers to things that run on electricity and often have some sort of computer inside of them – something like a cell phone or a tablet, an iPad,  a computer, and so forth. All of these would be portable electronic devices. They’re  things that you can take with you. You can put in a small bag and carry them.

The flight attendant is telling Alec he has to turn  off his portable electronic devices for takeoff. “Takeoff” (takeoff) is when the plane leaves the ground. Although the rules are changing for this, for a lon g time you could not use any sort of electronic devices for the first 10 minutes  or so of your flight – when the plane was taking off, and then again at the end of your flight when the plane was landing. That’s what the flight attendant is talkin g about here. She’s telling Alec he has to turn off his laptop. A “laptop” (laptop) is also called a “notebook computer.” It’s a very small computer that usually folds up like a book so that you can carry it more easily.

 Alec says, “I just need to finish one last email.” The flight attendant says, “Sir, we can’t take off until you turn that computer off.” T he flight attendant is telling Alec that the plane can’t leave until he turns off his c omputer. Alec says, “Fine. It’s off.” Notice the way he says “fine” indicates that he’s angry. Even though “fine” normally means okay, it’s clear Alec is not happy.

He says, “Why all the fuss anyway?” “Fuss” (fuss) can be used in a couple of different ways. Here, it means: Why all of the inte rest? Why all of the excitement? Why are we making such a big deal of this particula r situation? “To make a fuss” means to cause problems or to get excited about som ething. Some people, when they complain about something, make a fuss. They ye ll and they get angry and they get very excited. That’s one meaning of “fuss. ”

The flight attendant says, “It’s regulations,” mean ing the reason is that we have rules – that is, regulations – about using portable  electronic devices on airplanes. She says, “Signals emitted by electronics may inter fere with the plane’s communications systems or navigation.” A “signal” ( signal) is an electronic message. “Emitted” (emitted) means produced or sent  out. Electronics sometimes send out signals – especially, for exampl e, a cell phone. These signals, according to the flight attendant, “may in terfere with the plane’s communications systems.” “To interfere” with someth ing is to create problems for something, to prevent something from doing what it is supposed to do.

“Communications systems” are the radios and compute rs that the plane uses to communicate with other planes and with the people o n the ground. “Navigation” (navigation) refers to how you get from one place to another. Your “navigation systems” are the systems that tell the plane where to go. Maps and other electronic instruments are used in navigating the p lane – in getting the plane to go from one place to another, in making sure the pl ane goes to the right place. If you’re taking a plane to Chicago and the plane inst ead goes to Dallas, you won’t be very happy.

Alec says “All right,” meaning okay. The flight att endant says, “Sir, you’ll also need to turn off your tablet computer and your cell  phone.” Your “tablet (tablet) computer,” more commonly nowadays called, simply, y our “tablet,” is an electronic device that does a lot of the things tha t a computer does, but is smaller and usually doesn’t have a keyboard. It doesn’t hav e a place for you to type other than the actual tablet itself. It depends on the ta blet you have. iPads, for example, are tablet computers. They’re computers in  the form of a tablet.

The flight attendant tells Alec to turn off his tab let and his cell phone. “Those are also considered portable electronic devices,” she s ays. Alec says, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” That expression, “You’ve got to be kidding me,” is when you are very surprised at what someone is saying. It may ev en indicate that you dis agree with what a person is saying or you think tha t what a person is saying is wrong.

Alec says, “You mean I have to sit here twiddling m y thumbs while I wait for the plane to take off?” “To twiddle (twiddle) your thum bs (thumbs)” means to be bored and have nothing to do. Literally, it means to put your hands together and move your thumbs around each other very quickly. “T o twiddle your thumbs” means to sit around and do nothing, in this case.

Alec says, “I thought the FAA eased up on those reg ulations.” The “FAA” in the United States is the “Federal Aviation Administrati on.” It’s the U.S. government agency that takes care of regulating and making rul es for airplanes. “To ease (ease) up on” something means to do less or use som ething less. The FAA easing up on regulations would mean the FAA is no l onger enforcing – no longer telling people they have to follow the regulations – or changing the regulations to make things easier.

Alec is saying that the FAA has eased up on the reg ulations – they’ve changed the rules on things like using portable electronic devices on airplanes. The flight attendant says, however, “I’m afraid not, sir. Plea se power down all of your devices so we can proceed with takeoff.” “To power down” something means to turn it off, especially something that is running o n electricity.

Alec says, “Okay, fine. What am I supposed to do un til we get the all-clear to use our electronics again?” The term “all-clear” (clear ) refers to a signal that you are given, a message that is communicated to you that i ndicates that what you could not do before, you can now do – that the situation has changed so that you are now able to do something that you were not able to do before – in this case, to use electronic devices. The flight attendant says, “Perhaps you could read a magazine.” Alec said, “That’s what I was doing on m y tablet before you made me turn it off.” The flight attendant is referring, of  course, not to an electronic magazine, but to a paper magazine.

She says, “Perhaps you could take a flying leap out  the window.” “To take a flying leap” (leap) is a very rude informal express ion used to tell someone to leave or to go away. “You can take a flying leap” is something you would say to someone who perhaps did something wrong or made you  angry and now you want that person to leave. It’s an insulting inform al phrase. Alec says, “What did

you say?” He can’t believe what the flight attendan t just told him, since flight attendants are not supposed to be rude to their cus tomers.

So the attendant changes what she just said – prete nds as though she had said something else. She says, “I said, look at that lug gage heap out the window.” A “heap” (heap) is a large pile of something, a large  number of objects that are sitting one on top of the other. When they put your  luggage, your bags, into the bottom of the plane, usually they come out on a big  cart, a big truck, and the bags are all put one on top of the other in a large  pile or a large heap.

The flight attendant is changing what she said so t hat Alec doesn’t get angry. She’s pretending that she said, “Look at that lugga ge heap out the window” rather than “Take a flying leap out the window,” wh ich is what, of course, she actually said. The flight attendant is not very hap py with Alec, since Alec is causing all sorts of problems on the airplane.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Flight attendant: I’m sorry, sir, but all passenger s need to turn off their portable electronic devices for takeoff, so you’ll need to t urn off your laptop.

Alec: I just need to finish one last email.

Flight attendant: Sir, we can’t take off until you turn that computer off.

Alec: Fine. It’s off. Why all the fuss, anyway?

Flight attendant: It’s regulations. Signals emitted  by electronics may interfere with the plane’s communication systems or navigation.

Alec: All right.

Flight attendant: Sir, you’ll also need to turn off  your tablet computer and your cell phone. Those are also considered portable electroni c devices.

Alec: You’ve got to be kidding me. You mean I have to sit here twiddling my thumbs while I wait for the plane to take off? I th ought the FAA eased up on those regulations.

 Flight attendant: I’m afraid not, sir. Please power  down all of your devices so we can proceed with takeoff.

Alec: Okay, fine. What am I suppose to do until we get the all clear to use our electronics again?

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could read a magazine .

Alec: That’s what I was doing on my tablet before y ou made me turn it off.

Flight attendant: Perhaps you could take a flying l eap out the window.

Alec: What did you say?

Flight attendant: I said, “Look at that luggage hea p out the window.”

# Having a Backup Plan

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 970 – Having a Backup Plan.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 970. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Jerome and Sandy  about having a plan in case there’s a problem with what you’re doing. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: This is a very dangerous undertaking. Do yo u have a backup plan if anything goes wrong?

Sandy: It’ll work. I’ve come up with contingencies for every possible setback.

Jerome: It’s just that I’d like to know we have som e recourse if anything goes wrong.

Sandy: My plan is foolproof. Failure is not an opti on.

Jerome: But don’t you think we should consider some  alternatives? If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it would be good to have an es cape hatch, don’t you think?

Sandy: That won’t be necessary. If anything goes wr ong, it’s every man for himself.

Jerome: What?! I thought we were in this together? What happened to, “Stick with me and you can’t go wrong”?

Sandy: That was before I realized what a liability you are.

Jerome: A liability?!

Sandy: In a dangerous plan like this, there are bou nd to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.

Jerome: Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-cross m e before we even got started!

[end of dialogue]

Jerome begins our dialogue by saying to Sandy, “This is a very dangerous undertaking.” An “undertaking” (undertaking) is jus t another word for a project, something that you are doing, often something that is a little difficult – a little “challenging,” we might say. Jerome says, “This is a dangerous undertaking,” meaning you might get hurt. “Do you have a backup p lan if anything goes wrong?” he asks Sandy. A “backup (backup) plan” is what you will do if your first plan doesn’t work. We might call it an “alternative ” to the plan that you have now.

For example, I want to go to a restaurant that is a bout 15 miles from my house. To get to the restaurant, I have to take the freewa y. I decide to go to this restaurant, but when I get on the freeway, it’s ver y crowded. There’s a lot of what we would call “traffic” – too many cars, making eve ryone move very slowly. So, I decide, “No, this is a bad idea.” I have a backup p lan, however. My backup plan is to go to a different restaurant that’s only one mile from my house and is easy to get to. Because there were problems in trying to  carry out my first plan, I decided to go to my backup plan.

Sandy says, about the plan that she has, “It’ll wor k,” meaning it will work. She says, “I’ve come up with contingencies for every po ssible setback.” “To come up with” something is a phrasal verb meaning to have i nvented or created or thought of something. “Contingencies” (contingencies) are t hings that might happen. They won’t all happen, probably, but some of these things might happen. This word “contingency” is often used when talking about  a plan, especially a formal plan, such as in your business.

You have a plan, but you also think there might be some problems in the future, so you have different possibilities that might happ en: if this happens, then we’re going to do this; if something else happens, then we’re going to do that. So, you have all sorts of contingencies – things that might  happen that you are prepared for. Sandy says she’s come up with “contingencies” – things that they can do for every possible setback. A “setback” (setback) is wh en you have a problem with your plan – some difficulty or obstacle that makes it difficult or impossible for you to continue with your original plan.

We often use the term “temporary setback,” meaning it’s a problem now, but it won’t be a problem in the future – it’s just for a short amount of time. Jerome says, “It’s just that I’d like to know we have some  recourse if anything goes wrong.” “Recourse” (recourse) is something you can do when you are in a difficult situation, something that you can do to make things better. This is a somewhat formal word. “To have recourse to” somethi ng is to have the possibility of using something in order to help you if you have  a problem.

If you wake up in the morning and your car has been  stolen and you need to get to work, your only recourse might be taking a bus. That would be your recourse – what would help you, in this difficult situation, to do what you need to do. Sandy says, “My plan is foolproof.” “Foolproof” means tha t it cannot possibly fail. There is no possibility of anything going wrong.

She says, “Failure is not an option.” That expressi on, “failure is not an option,” is used to emphasize that you have to succeed – you mu st be successful. You cannot possibly not be successful. If you are, then  terrible things will happen. “Failure is not an option” means we must succeed. O f course, just because you want to succeed doesn’t mean you will succeed. Jero me says, “But don’t you think we should consider some alternatives?” An “al ternative” is another possible way of doing something. Jerome is asking Sandy to t hink about what they are going to do if something goes wrong.

He says, “If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it w ould be good to have an escape hatch, don’t you think? The phrase “God forb id” (forbid) is used to emphasize that you don’t want something to happen, and you hope that God will prevent it from happening, but it might happen. It’ s an expression that we use when we are saying, “Well, I really don’t want this  to happen. I hope this doesn’t happen, but we have to be prepared if it does happe n.” And that’s what Jerome is saying here. If the plan fails, they need to hav e alternatives. They need to have an escape hatch.

An “escape (escape) hatch (hatch)” refers to a door  that would allow you to escape or get out of something such as an airplane or some sort of space vehicle in an emergency. If you need to get out of whatever  you are in immediately because there’s some problem, you might use an esca pe hatch. This is a way of getting out of a plane or a spacecraft very quickly  in case something goes wrong. However, here it is used not literally to mean a do or, but rather an alternative or a plan that will allow you to get out of a difficult situation if your original plan doesn’t succeed.

Sandy says, “That won’t be necessary.” They will no t need an escape hatch, Sandy is saying. “If anything goes wrong, it’s ever y man for himself.” That expression, “every man for himself,” is used to sho w that each person is responsible for his own future and cannot depend on  other people to help him. If there is a problem with a plan and it looks like ev eryone may be hurt or may be in danger, then each person has to save himself, basic ally, is what this means. “Every man for himself” means I’m not going to help  you; you have to get out of this difficult situation yourself. Jerome says, “Wh at?! I thought we were in this together?” “To be in this together” means to be wor king as part of a team.

Jerome says, “What happened to, ‘stick with me, and  you can’t go wrong?’” “What happened to” is a way of saying, “What about the idea you told me before?” or “Is this still true?” And it’s followed  by, usually, something the other person said that he doesn’t seem to believe anymore . “What happened to, ‘stick with me, and you can’t go wrong?’” “To stick with” someone means to stay close to someone, to follow someone’s example, or to lite rally be with someone during the entire plan or during the entire action that yo u’re doing together. It’s sometimes used to mean, simply, follow what I do; d o what I do; learn from me.

Sandy told Jerome, “Stick with me, and you can’t go  wrong.” The phrase “can’t go wrong” means that everything will be fine. There  will be no problems. Sandy says, “That was before I realized what a liability you are.” A “liability” (liability) is something – or, in this case, someone – representin g a disadvantage. If you say this person is a “liability,” you mean this person will cause us problems or this person might prevent us from being successful at do ing what we want to do. Jerome says, “A liability?!” He’s surprised that Sa ndy thinks that he is a problem.

Sandy says, “In a dangerous plan like this, there a re bound to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.” “Bound (bo und) to be” means that there will definitely be. It is certain. “Casualties” (ca sualties) are usually people who die or who are hurt in a war or some sort of accident. “Sacrificial lamb” refers to something that needs to be destroyed or something t hat needs to be killed in order for you to succeed at your plan. Of course, the thing or person killed isn’t usually very happy about that. The term “sacrificia l lamb” comes from the very ancient, old practice of sacrificing, or killing, a n animal to honor God or to honor some divine power.

Jerome says, “Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-c ross me before we even got started.” So, Sandy is saying that in every dangero us plan, some people will probably get hurt, but that it’s necessary that tha t happen in order for the plan to be successful sometimes. Jerome says yes, he unders tands that. However, he didn’t realize that Sandy would double-cross him be fore they even got started.

 “To double-cross” means to trick or betray someone – to do something that would lose the trust of another person. “To double- cross” means to say, “Oh, yes, I’ll do that,” and then, the very next moment, to d o the opposite. The term “to double-cross” can also be used to describe the act of cheating another person.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: This is a very dangerous undertaking. Do yo u have a backup plan if anything goes wrong?

Sandy: It’ll work. I’ve come up with contingencies for every possible setback.

Jerome: It’s just that I’d like to know we have som e recourse if anything goes wrong.

Sandy: My plan is foolproof. Failure is not an opti on.

Jerome: But don’t you think we should consider some  alternatives? If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it would be good to have an es cape hatch, don’t you think?

Sandy: That won’t be necessary. If anything goes wr ong, it’s every man for himself.

Jerome: What?! I thought we were in this together? What happened to, “Stick with me and you can’t go wrong”?

Sandy: That was before I realized what a liability you are.

Jerome: A liability?!

Sandy: In a dangerous plan like this, there are bou nd to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.

Jerome: Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-cross m e before we even got started!

This episode is a dialogue between Monique and Jurg en about trying to see a doctor who is very busy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Monique: Ugh!

Jurgen: What’s the matter?

Monique: My GP referred me to a specialist for my b ack problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks! I’m wait listed in case there’s a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.

Jurgen: Can’t you just go see another specialist?

Monique: I could, but my GP says that she’s the bes t in the business. In the meantime, I’ll try to see a physical therapist abou t my neck. It’s flaring up again.

Jurgen: At least you’ll get some relief.

Monique: Maybe. I have to call back tomorrow mornin g to see if she can fit me in. She’s really booked up, too. While I’m waiting, I g uess I could try to see the podiatrist about my feet.

Jurgen: You’re having feet problems, too?

Monique: Yeah, my whole body is falling apart. I th ink I’m nearly past my expiration date!

 [end of dialogue]

Monique begins our little dialogue by saying, “Ugh. ” She’s expressing disappointment about something, we’re not sure what . Jurgen asks her, “What’s the matter?” meaning what is the problem? Monique s ays, “My GP referred me to a specialist for my back problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks.” Your “GP” is your general practitioner. A “ general practitioner” is a medical doctor who provides what we might describe as “general care.” If you’re sick or have a problem, the first person, the first  doctor you would probably go to see would be your “general practitioner,” or your “ GP.” That’s the doctor who handles all sorts of cases, all sorts of problems.

If your problem is one the doctor – the GP – cannot  solve or cannot help you with, he may send you to a specialist. A “specialis t” (specialist) is a medical doctor who knows a lot about one particular kind of  problem or topic. You could have a specialist in cancer. You could have someone  who is a specialist in bones. You could have someone who is a specialist i n feet. Doctors have all sorts of specialties that they can focus on or conc entrate on, and that’s the problem Monique is having. Her GP referred her to a  specialist for her back problems. However, the specialist doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks.

An “opening” is an appointment that is available, a  time when you can go in and see a certain person – in this case, a doctor. Howe ver, this doctor doesn’t have any available appointments for eight weeks. Monique  says, “I’m waitlisted in case there is a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.” “To be waitlisted” (wai tlisted) means to have your name put on a list so that if someone decides not to go to their appointment – if someone cancels their appointment – you can take th eir place.

What will often happen is that doctor will call you , or the doctor’s receptionist or nurse will call you, and tell you, “Hey, we have an  available appointment at ten o’clock tomorrow morning because someone canceled” – someone said they could not make it, even though they had an appointm ent scheduled. That’s what a “cancellation” is – when someone says, “No, I can ’t make it to that appointment”; “I won’t be able to go to that appoin tment.” Monique has been waitlisted. She’s on a “waiting list,” waiting for someone to cancel.

Monique says if there is not a cancellation, she’ll  have to endure the pain “for at least another eight weeks.” “To endure” (endure) me ans to suffer from something for a long period of time, but you don’t complain a bout it. So, someone who

“endures” suffering or “endures” pain has the pain,  suffers from the pain, feels the pain, but doesn’t complain about it – is “brave ” about it, we might say.

Jurgen says, “Can’t you just go see another special ist?” meaning isn’t it possible for you to see a different doctor, a different spec ialist? Monique says, “I could, but my GP says that she is the best in the business .” Her doctor is telling her that this particular specialist is “the best in the busi ness.” The word “business” here just means area or field or type of work. To say so meone is “the best in the business” means that they are the best at what they  do. They may be the best baseball player. They may be the best manager. They  may be the best podcaster. Whatever the occupation or whatever the area of work is, this person is the best at doing that.

Monique says, “In the meantime,” while she’s waitin g, “I’ll try to see a physical therapist about my neck.” “A physical therapist” (t herapist) is a person who helps you recover after you have had an injury. For examp le, if you hurt your leg – let’s say you break your leg in an accident – after your leg gets better, you may have to go to physical therapy to help you strengthen the muscles again in your leg. The physical therapist will do things to help you r ecover or get better from this injury. Usually it’s an injury to a muscle or somet hing related to your arms and legs.

Monique says, “It’s flaring up again.” “To flare (f lare) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get worse, especially when we’re ta lking about pain or some sort of illness or sickness that gets better and th en it gets worse and then it gets better again. It’s a temporary increase in the pain  or in whatever health problem you have. You could talk about your allergies “flar ing up.” That would mean your allergies would suddenly be getting worse. You have  an allergy when your body reacts negatively to some substance or something th at it comes in contact with, either by breathing or by eating or by touching.

Monique doesn’t have an allergy. She has a back pro blem, and it’s flaring up once more. Jurgen says, “At least you’ll get some r elief.” “Relief” (relief) is a reduction in pain or a release from pain – when you  get better and you no longer feel the pain. There used to be a commercial on tel evision about an antacid – something that would help your stomach feel better if it wasn’t feeling well. The name of the antacid was Rolaids, and the commercial  said, “How do you spell relief?” But then the person on the commercial spel led “Rolaids” (Rolaids).

Well, that’s actually not how you spell relief. We spelled it for you already, but that’s just something I think of when I am spelling  the word “relief,” that old commercial. Back to our story: Monique says maybe s he’ll get some relief –

maybe she’ll feel better from the pain that she is feeling by going to see a physical therapist. She says, “I have to call back tomorrow morning to see if she” – the physical therapist – “can fit me in.”

The expression “to fit someone in” or “to fit in” s omeone means to arrange your appointments so that you can see someone who didn’t  have an appointment before. When a doctor, for example, has a very busy  schedule, he has someone that he’s going to see every hour. But then one of his patients calls and asks him if he can fit her in – if he can find time to see h er even though she doesn’t have an appointment. That’s what Monique wants to do.

Unfortunately, the physical therapist is “really bo oked up.” “To be booked (booked) up” means to have a lot of commitments, to  be very busy, to not have any appointments available. Monique says, “While I’ m waiting, I guess I could try to see the podiatrist about my feet.” A “podiatrist ” (podiatrist) is a doctor whose specialty is feet, a doctor who takes care of your feet if you have some sort of problem with them. Monique has a back problem, but now we learn she also has a foot problem. Jurgen says, “You” [have] “feet pro blems, too?”

Monique says, “Yeah, my whole body is falling apart .” The phrasal verb “to fall apart” means to no longer work properly, usually be cause it’s very old. We talk about a machine falling apart after many years. You  might have a machine you use to wash your clothing, for example. But after m any years, it starts to have problems. It begins to fall apart – to not work pro perly. Monique says her body is “falling apart.” We normally don’t use this phrasal  verb when talking about your body, but Monique is making a little joke here, com paring her body to a machine.

She says, “I think I’m nearly past my expiration da te.” An “expiration (expiration) date” is a time or a date that is put on, usually, a package with food in it, that tells you the date by which you need to eat the food. For  example, if you buy milk and it says the expiration date is June 20th, that mean s that you should drink the milk by June 20th. Actually, you usually can drink it for a few days after that. The idea of an expiration date, then, is a date after which you probably shouldn’t eat a certain kind of food or drink a certain kind of dri nk.

Monique again is making a joke here, comparing her body to food – I guess saying that she’s nearly past her expiration date, meaning she’s getting old and that’s why her body is falling apart.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Monique: Ugh!

Jurgen: What’s the matter?

Monique: My GP referred me to a specialist for my b ack problems, but she doesn’t have any openings for eight weeks! I’m wait listed in case there’s a cancellation, but if there isn’t one, I’ll have to endure this pain for at least another eight weeks.

Jurgen: Can’t you just go see another specialist?

Monique: I could, but my GP says that she’s the bes t in the business. In the meantime, I’ll try to see a physical therapist abou t my neck. It’s flaring up again.

Jurgen: At least you’ll get some relief.

# Paying an Employee Under the Table

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 972 – Paying an Employee Under the Table.

This episode is a dialogue between Martin and Jina about working at a business illegally, or without paying your taxes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: I’m confused. I’ve been going over the book s and I don’t see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.

Jina: Oh, I have a special arrangement with a few of them. I pay them under the table.

Martin: Are you sure that’s wise? You could get bus ted for tax evasion.

Jina: No one will be the wiser if I pay a few peopl e off the books. All of the people I hire want a job, and a few of them I pay under the minimum wage. Since they don’t have to report their income, they come out ah ead in the end. So what’s the problem?

Martin: I just want to make sure you’re aware of the ramifications. If the government finds out about it, you could be up the creek.

Jina: I’m not worried. Everybody does it.

Martin: If you say so. I’m willing to turn a blind eye, but you’re on your own if you get audited!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Martin saying, “I'm confus ed. I've been going over the books and I don't see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.” The expression “going over the books” refers to looking  at the financial documents of a business, the sort of thing an accountant would d o. The “books” refers here not to a set of books that you would read for pleasure,  but rather a list of all the things that your business has bought and sold, in s uch a way that you can see whether you are making money or not.

Martin is “going over the books” – the financial re cords of the business – but he doesn't see several members of the staff listed in the books. That is, he doesn't see their names and the amount of money that is bei ng paid to them. “Staff” (staff) here just refers to a group of employees. “ To be accounted for” means to be included, to be considered, or sometimes simply to know where someone is or to know information about a certain person. Mart in doesn't have the information about these members of the staff, these  employees, in the financial records of the business.

Jina says, “Oh, I have a special arrangement with a  few of them.” A “special arrangement” would be a special agreement, in this case. She says, “I pay them under the table.” “To pay someone under the table” means not to tell the government about how much you are paying a person. This, of course, is normally considered illegal. It's against the law to pay an employee without telling the government. Why? Because the government wants its money in the form of taxes. You have to pay taxes when you have an emplo yee, which means you have to tell the government that you have an employ ee.

“To pay someone under the table” would mean that yo u're not telling the government. Martin says, “Are you sure that's wise? ” meaning do you really think that's a good idea? “You could get busted for tax e vasion.” “To get busted” (busted) is to get caught by the authorities – or i n this case, by the government – for doing something illegal. If the police arrest y ou for drinking and driving, you would get “busted.” We could say, “You got busted” – you got arrested, you got caught, you got found out. You can also use this in  a school, for example. If a student is doing something wrong and the teacher fi nds out, we could say that student got “busted.” The teacher would punish the student.

In our dialogue, Martin is worried about Jina getti ng busted for tax evasion. “Evasion” (evasion) is avoiding something, not doing something. “Tax evasion” would be not paying your taxes, and the government doesn't like that at all. Jina is not worried, however. She says, “No one will be the wiser if I pay a few people off the books.” The expression “No one will be the wiser” (wiser) means nobody

will know what has happened, and it will remain a s ecret. “No one will be the wiser” means no one will find out.

“Off the books” is similar to “under the table.” Re member, the “books” in this case refers to the financial records of a business. “Off  the books” would be things that are not included in your financial records. Again, this is usually considered illegal, and the government is not happy if it finds out tha t you are not recording all of the business transactions for your business. So unhappy  they could come and make you pay a lot of money or make you spend some time in a government hotel, which is also called a “jail.”

Jina says, “All of the people I hire want a job, an d a few of them I pay under the minimum wage.” The “minimum (minimum) wage (wage)” is the lowest amount, or the minimum amount, that you can pay someone eac h hour for working. The government says you cannot pay someone less than a certain amount every hour. This minimum wage is established by the natio nal, or federal, government. Although individual states often have their own min imum wages, which are sometimes higher than the federal minimum wage, Jin a is paying some of the employees less than the minimum wage, which is defi nitely illegal.

She says, however, that “since they don't have to r eport their income, they come out ahead in the end.” “To report your income” mean s to tell the government how much money you are making. “Income” (income) refers  to the amount of money that you get from working. You have to report your income so the government can determine if you need to pay taxes or not. In the United States, if you don't make very much money, you still have to report your  income, but the government doesn't make you pay very much in taxes. In fact, i n many cases, it doesn't make you pay any income taxes.

There are other special taxes that you still have to pay even if you don't make very much money, but the most important, the larges t tax that you pay is typically called your “income tax.” If you don't make very mu ch money, the government may collect the money from you during the year, but  then it will send it back to you after you report your income on what are called  your “tax returns.” But we're getting off our topic a little bit here. Let's go b ack to the dialogue.

Jina says that the employees “don't have to report their income, so they come out ahead.” “To come out ahead” is an expression that m eans to gain some sort of benefit. Specifically, it refers to a situation whe re you are receiving money, but you're also needing to pay someone money for some e xpense that you have. “To come out ahead” would be to bring in more money tha n you have to pay out, so your income, we could say, is greater than your exp enses.

 Another word for this simply is “profit” (profit). If you are making a profit – if you are bringing in more money than you are paying out in your business – you are coming out ahead. The term can be used more general ly to refer to someone who benefits from a certain situation, even if it i sn't financial. Here, it is financial, and Jina says the employees that she is paying off the books come out ahead. “What's the problem?” she asks. Martin says, “I jus t want to make sure that you are aware of the ramifications.” “Ramifications” (r amifications) are the consequences – things that result from a certain ac tion or decision.

Martin says, “If the government finds out about it,  you could be up the creek.” This expression, “to be up the creek” (creek), mean s to be in a very difficult situation, to have a lot of problems. It comes in p art from an expression, “to be up a creek without a paddle” (paddle). A “creek” is a small river. A “paddle” is something that you use. Usually, it's made of wood that is long and is flat and is put in the water to help you move your boat in the water. “To be up a creek without a paddle” is to be in a situation where you  can't get back to where you need to be, and that's why it is used to express th is idea of having problems, having difficulties.

Jina says, “I’m not worried. Everybody does it.” Th is, of course, is what most people use as their excuse for doing something wron g: “Well, everybody does it.” Martin says, “If you say so,” meaning I don't neces sarily believe you, but if you say it's true, then I'm not going to argue with you . “I'm willing to turn a blind eye, but you're on your own if you get audited.” “To tur n a blind eye” means to pretend that you don't see something – to pretend that some thing didn't happen or that you didn't see it happen. “To be blind” (blind) mea ns to be unable to see. “To turn a blind eye” on something means to ignore something , especially something unpleasant or something that perhaps you could get in trouble for.

Martin says to Jina, “You're on your own if you get  audited.” “To be on your own” means to be alone – in this case, it means to have to do something without anyone helping you. Martin is not going to help Jin a if she gets audited. “To audit” (audit) means to examine the financial recor ds of a person or a business to make sure that they are correct. “To audit” means to make sure that the person or organization is following the law.

To get audited by the government is usually not a g ood thing. It means you have to show that all of your financial records are comp lete. So, you have to be very careful about keeping good financial records for yo ur business.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Martin: I’m confused. I’ve been going over the book s and I don’t see several members of the staff listed and accounted for.

Jina: Oh, I have a special arrangement with a few of them. I pay them under the table.

Martin: Are you sure that’s wise? You could get bus ted for tax evasion.

Jina: No one will be the wiser if I pay a few peopl e off the books. All of the people I hire want a job, and a few of them I pay under the minimum wage. Since they don’t have to report their income, they come out ah ead in the end. So what’s the problem?

Martin: I just want to make sure you’re aware of the ramifications. If the government finds out about it, you could be up the creek.

Jina: I’m not worried. Everybody does it.

Martin: If you say so. I’m willing to turn a blind eye, but you’re on your own if you get audited!

Kenji: I’m not interested in Joanna at all. She’s n ot my type.

Angie: Then you’re the only one. Every guy I know t hinks she’s hot. She has a bunch of them at her beck and call.

Kenji: Then she won’t care if I don’t take an inter est in her. I don’t like women who behave as though they’re God’s gift to men.

Angie: Don’t look now, but she’s making a beeline f or you.

Kenji: Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy exit.

Angie: Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?

Kenji: I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to t angle with.

[end of dialogue]

 Our dialogue begins with Angie saying to Kenji, “Oo h, it looks like Joanna has her sights set on you.” “To have your sights set on ” someone means that you are interested in someone, especially in someone with w hom you would like to have a romantic relationship. You can also “have your si ghts set on” an object that you want to acquire or buy or purchase. You can have yo ur sights set on a particular car or one particular computer. In this case, howev er, we’re talking about a woman who has her sights set on Kenji.

Angie says, “Look at how she’s giving you the eye.”  “To give someone the eye” (eye) means, again, to look at them with a certain expression that indicates that you are interested in them romantically. Kenji says , “Is she?” meaning is she giving me the eye? “I hadn’t noticed” – I didn’t re alize. Angie says, “Watch out.” “Watch out” is an expression that means be careful,  or you better use caution. It’s especially used if there’s some sort of danger invo lved.

Angie says, “Watch out, she” – meaning Joanna – “us ually gets what she wants and she doesn’t take no for an answer.” That expres sion – he or she “doesn’t take no for an answer” – means this person is very “persistent,” we would say. This person is going to keep trying to get what he wants and won’t stop until he gets it. In this case, Joanna won’t stop until she gets what she wants. That’s the meaning of this expression “doesn’t take no for an answer.”

Kenji says, “I’m not interested in Joanna at all.” “At all” is a very common phrase used to emphasize the verb in the negative meaning:  not even a little bit. “I’m not interested in watching your cat tonight at all.” Th at means I’m not interested even a little bit. “At all” added at the end of this sen tence here means you are emphasizing that particular point. You really don’t  want to do that thing.

Kenji says, “She’s not my type.” “To be someone’s t ype” (type) means to have the characteristics of someone to whom you would be  romantically attracted. Some men like women with blond hair. Some men like women with brunette hair. Me, I like women with hair. Whatever it is, you are  interested in a certain kind of person, and that kind of person is your “type.” Ken ji says that Joanna is not his type. She’s not the kind of woman that he would nor mally be attracted to. Angie says, “Then you’re the only one. Every guy” – every  man – “I know thinks she’s hot.” “To be hot” (hot) is to be very attractive, to be very good looking.

“She has a bunch of them at her beck and call,” Ang ie says. “She” – again, Joanna – “has a bunch of them at her beck and call. ” A “bunch” (bunch) is a group of something – a group of things or a group of people. In this case, we’re talking about men. Joanna has a bunch of men, a lar ge number of men, at her

beck and call. That expression, “at someone’s beck (beck) and call (call),” means you have a lot of people, in this case, who respond  to your requests and your needs immediately. If you say, “I have this person at my beck and call,” you mean this person will do whatever you want right aw ay.

The expression is used to show in a way how you dom inate or control another person – to make them do whatever you want them to do. It’s not a very common expression anymore, but you will still hear it and certainly read it. Angie says that Joanna has a large group of men at her beck and cal l, meaning there are a lot of men who are very interested in her romantically and  would therefore do whatever she wanted them to do. Kenji says, “Then she won’t care if I don’t take an interest in her.” “To take an interest in” someone means to be concerned about them or to pay attention to them. In this case, it means to be interested in a romantic relationship with this person.

Kenji says, “I don’t like women who behave as thoug h they’re God’s gift to man.” The expression “God’s gift to” someone is used sarc astically, in a joking way, to mean that somebody thinks that he or she is very sp ecial and better than everyone else. In some way, Kenji describes Joanna as thinking that she’s “God’s gift to man,” meaning she’s very beautiful a nd that all men should be interested in her. Angie says, “Don’t look now, but  she’s making a beeline for you.” “To make a beeline” (beeline) for someone mea ns to walk in someone’s direction, directly toward someone, without being d istracted by anything in your way.

If you go to a party and you see that there are som e cookies and snacks on a table, and you’re very hungry, you might make a bee line for that table as soon as you walk into the room. You really want to eat, so you’re going to go right for that location, that table. “To make a beeline for” someo ne means to walk towards someone, especially someone to whom you want to tal k or in whom you are interested. That’s the case with Joanna. She’s obvi ously interested in Kenji in a romantic way.

Kenji says, “Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy ex it.” A “cue” (cue) is a signal reminding you of what to do or when to do it. A “cu e” here is an indication of something. So, when Kenji says, “It’s my cue” to do  something, he means that’s my indication, that’s telling me I should do someth ing, that is a situation where I am being reminded, in a way, to do something. What Kenji wants to do is “to beat a speedy exit.” “To beat (beat) a speedy (speedy) e xit” means to leave very quickly and suddenly – to decide, “Oh, I’m going to  go right now,” and then leave.

We would use this expression when we are trying to escape some dangerous situation or some situation that we want to avoid. There’s another expression, perhaps a little bit more common, called “to beat a  hasty retreat.” “Hasty” (hasty) means the same as speedy. It means very quickly. A “retreat” (retreat) here means to go back from where you were, to go back to  a place where you started from. Usually, we use this word “retreat” when we’r e talking about a battle in a war, when one side in the battle has to go back to where they came from because they’re being beaten by the other side.

“To beat a hasty retreat” means to go back to where  you were because you are being beaten, you are being defeated, and you need to go back and protect yourself – back to the place where you began. It co uld also mean to leave quickly, but it would be used more specifically in the case where you are being defeated in something, and you need to leave quickl y in order to avoid getting completely beaten, I guess.

Angie says, “Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?” “To give someone the brush (brush) off (off)” means to ignore someon e, to reject someone – not to give someone your attention and perhaps even your r espect. Kenji says, “I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to tangle with. ” “To tangle (tangle) with” someone means to become involved with someone in su ch a way that things become very unpleasant, because the person may be a  very difficult person, or it may be a person with whom you will not get along wi th very well.

You could also use this expression when you anticip ate, you expect, that there are going to be problems in dealing with this perso n, and you don’t want to be involved in those problems. Kenji does not want to tangle with Joanna, and so he’s going to leave wherever it is they are and get  away from her. I’ve never had this problem, actually, of a woman making a beeline  for me and me wanting to ignore her. Never had that happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angie: Ooh, it looks like Joanna has her sights set  on you. Look at how she’s giving you the eye.

Kenji: Is she? I hadn’t noticed.

Angie: Watch out, she usually gets what she wants a nd she doesn’t take no for an answer.

 Kenji: I’m not interested in Joanna at all. She’s n ot my type.

Angie: Then you’re the only one. Every guy I know t hinks she’s hot. She has a bunch of them at her beck and call.

Kenji: Then she won’t care if I don’t take an inter est in her. I don’t like women who behave as though they’re God’s gift to men.

Angie: Don’t look now, but she’s making a beeline f or you.

Kenji: Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy exit.

Angie: Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?

Kenji: I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to t angle with.

This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Della a bout vocabulary related to crimes, especially old crimes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paul: What are you watching?

Della: I’m watching a really good show about cold c ases. They take unsolved crimes from decades ago and reconstruct them, tryin g to solve them once and for all.

Paul: But after all this time, isn’t the trail cold ? How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?

Della: They go over the witness testimony and use s cientific methods that didn’t exist many years ago.

Paul: Isn’t there a statute of limitations for most  crimes?

Della: Yes, but not for murder.

Paul: I really doubt a TV show can solve crimes tha t the police couldn’t crack. Are any crimes really ever solved on the show?

Della: Yes, of course.

Paul: How? Through crack investigative methods or a  keen eye for detail?

Della: Deathbed confessions.

Paul: Ah.

[end of dialogue]

Paul begins our dialogue by asking Della, “What are  you watching?” Presumably – we can guess, that is, that Della is watching tel evision. Della says, “I’m watching a really good show about cold cases.” A “c old case” is a criminal investigation that has not been solved and is not, at this time, trying to be solved by the police department. The police may investigat e a crime for many months, sometimes even many years, and then they say, “Okay , there’s no sense trying to find out who did this because we haven’t been ab le to find out so far.” This crime then becomes a “cold case” – a cold investiga tion. It’s “cold” because it’s so old. Maybe that’s why I feel cold more often now  than I used to.

Well, Della is watching a television show about cri me, about cold cases. She says, “They take unsolved crimes from decades ago a nd reconstruct them.” “To solve (solve) a crime” is to figure out who is resp onsible for the crime – who “committed” the crime, we would say. “To solve a cr ime” is to find the person who is guilty of the crime. An “unsolved case” or an “u nsolved crime” is one where the police have not figured out who the guilty person i s. “Cold cases” are always unsolved crimes. Della says these that are being di scussed on the television show are “from decades ago.”

A “decade” (decade) is a period of 10 years. So, “s everal decades ago” would mean 20, 30, 40, maybe even 50 years ago – a long t ime ago. “To reconstruct” something is to build it again. “To construct” is to build something, to assemble something. “To reconstruct” would be to take someth ing that has perhaps fallen apart and build it again. However, here the verb re ally means to try to figure out everything that happened that is related to the cri me. “To reconstruct a crime” would be to try to figure out exactly who committed  the crime and all the different circumstances surrounding the crime.

The television show tries to solve these unsolved c rimes “once and for all.” “Once and for all” is a phrase meaning that once you do it, you won’t have to do it again. It’s the last time you’ll have to look at this issu e or try to do this thing. It will be completed. It will be finished.

Paul says, “But after all this time, isn’t the trai l cold?” A “trail” (trail), in this case, leads to a series of clues that are used to try to solve a crime. A “clue” (clue) is evidence that indicates the answer to a problem or the solution to a problem. Paul is saying that the trail is cold on these cold  cases, meaning it’s very difficult to try to follow the clues to figure out where the evidence is leading you.

 He says, “How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?” A “lead” (lead) is the same as a clue. It’s a piece of information that gi ves you some idea about what happened, that helps you solve the mystery or the c rime. Della says, “They go over the witness testimony and use scientific metho ds that didn’t exist many years ago.” A “witness” (witness) is someone who se es something, often something that is criminal or something that has go ne wrong.

You could also have a witness, however, to – for ex ample – your marriage. In the United States, in most places, if you get married, you have to sign an official government document, and there needs to be at least  two people who witness you sign the document who say, “Yes, this person si gned the document.” That’s also, of course, something that can go wrong – that  is to say, getting married. But normally, a “witness” is someone who sees a crime o r sees something bad happen.

“Testimony” (testimony) is a statement or statement s that someone makes about what happened, about what they know about a certain  topic. “Witness testimony” would be information that was provided by witnesses  to some crime, about what they saw or what they heard or what they know.

Della also says the television show uses “scientifi c methods.” “Scientific methods” would be techniques, or ways of doing some thing, that would help you figure out who committed the crime – using, perhaps , some special analysis. Perhaps chemicals or some sort of laboratory analys is that would help you figure out who the criminal was. A lot of times, especiall y nowadays, there is DNA evidence, genetic evidence that is left at the place where the crime was committed – what we call the “scene (scene) of the crime.” Sometimes those kinds of methods can be used to solve old criminal cases as well.

Paul says, “Isn’t there a statute of limitations for most crimes?” A “statute” (statute) is the same as a law. “Statute of limitat ions” refers to a law that says that if you are not caught for a crime – if the pol ice do not catch you for crime after a certain number of years – then you cannot b e arrested. So, if you do something wrong that isn’t very serious, and the po lice don’t find out about it until many years later, usually they can’t do anything ab out it because the statute of limitations says the police have only so many years  to find people guilty of these kinds of crimes.

“Murder,” however – when you kill someone – typical ly does not have any statute of limitations placed on it. That is, it doesn’t ma tter how long ago it was, the police can still arrest you and put you in prison. That’s what Della says here –

that for murder there is not a statute of limitatio ns. Paul says, “I really doubt a TV show can solve crimes that the police couldn’t crac k.” Paul doesn’t think the TV shows can figure out who the criminal was if the po lice couldn’t figure it out. The verb “to crack” (crack) means to solve a difficult problem – especially, to solve a crime.

Paul then asked Della, “Are any crimes really ever solved on the show?” Della says, “Yes, of course.” Paul asks, “How? “Through c rack investigative methods or a keen eye to detail?” “Investigative methods” w ould be ways that you try to get information about something – in this case, abo ut who committed the crime. “Crack” (crack) here is used as an adjective. Just a second ago, we used it as a verb meaning to solve a crime.

As an adjective, “crack” can mean very sharp, very smart, very good at what you are doing. “I am a crack basketball player.” I can play basketball better than anyone else in my house – better than my wife, that  is. That is one possible way of using “crack” as an adjective. “Crack investigat ive methods” would be very intelligent or smart ways of investigating a crime.  “A keen eye for detail” means the ability to notice small things that other peopl e perhaps would not notice. “A keen eye for detail” is the ability to see things t hat others cannot see.

Paul is asking if these are the ways that the telev ision show solves crimes. However, Della says that that’s not how they solve the crimes when they do solve crimes. They do it, according to Della, by us ing “deathbed confessions.” A “confession” is a statement admitting that you did something wrong. Sometimes, when the police catch a person who committed the cr ime, the person will just confess. They will say, “Okay, yes, I did it.” “Con fession” comes from the verb “to confess” (confess).

A “deathbed confession” is when you admit to doing something wrong as you are dying. Your “deathbed” is literally the place, the bed, where you are lying as you are dying, and right before you die, you say, “Oh, yes. I murdered this person,” or “I did this terrible thing many years ago.” Of cour se, it doesn’t take any investigative work by the police if someone confess es to a crime, and Della is saying here that this television show doesn’t reall y solve any crimes unless someone has confessed to them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paul: What are you watching?

 Della: I’m watching a really good show about cold c ases. They take unsolved crimes from decades ago and reconstruct them, tryin g to solve them once and for all.

Paul: But after all this time, isn’t the trail cold ? How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?

Della: They go over the witness testimony and use s cientific methods that didn’t exist many years ago.

# Making Food from Scratch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 975 – Making Food from Scratch.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 975. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. You can also like us on Facebook. Why not? Go to facebook.com/eslpod.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e about cooking food without using any canned food or other ingredients that you  would buy that have been already prepared for you. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I’m so excited to have the entire family comin g for a visit. For our first family dinner next Friday, I’m making everything from scra tch. I’m pulling out all the stops.

Walt: But have you ever made anything from scratch?

Ann: Sure I have, plenty of times.

Walt: If you say so, but our pantry is full of cann ed foods and jars, and nearly everything we’ve cooked in the past year has been p remixed. Are you sure you’re up to cooking a dinner for 12 from scratch?

Ann: How hard could it be? I just need to make sure  that the ingredients I buy are fresh, follow the recipes closely, add plenty of fr esh herbs and spices, and multitask.

Walt: You mean do a juggling act. It’ll take a lot of work and organization to pull this off.

Ann: I’m up to the challenge. And I have a backup p lan.

Walt: And that is?

Ann: Have you ever heard of the raw food movement?

[end of dialogue]

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Walt, “I’m so excited to have the entire family coming for a visit. For our first family din ner next Friday, I’m making everything from scratch.” Ann is excited because he r entire family is coming to visit her, and she wants to cook something for them  for dinner. She wants to make it “from scratch.” That expression, “from scra tch,” means you start with basic ingredients and make everything yourself. You  don’t use anything in a can or anything that has been prepared that you bought in the store.

So, if you’re going to make vegetable soup, you mak e your own “stock,” which is the liquid for a soup, you prepare the vegetables, and so forth. Ann says, “I’m pulling out all the stops.” “To pull out all the st ops” means to do something in the best way that you can, to do something fully – to d o something that would require a lot of work, but would be the most you could poss ibly do. This term actually comes from organ playing. When you play an organ ve ry loudly, you pull out all of the stops. The stops are parts of the organ that  you can pull out in order to make the organ louder. Well, Ann is pulling out all  the stops to make a big family dinner.

Walt says, “But have you ever made anything from sc ratch?” Walt doesn’t think Ann has ever prepared a meal from scratch. Ann, how ever, says, “Sure I have, plenty of times” – lots of times. Walt says, “If yo u say so.” That expression, “If you say so,” is used when you really don’t believe what  the other person is telling you, but you don’t want to argue with them. Walt sa ys, “Our pantry is full of canned foods and jars.” A “pantry” (pantry) is a sm all room, usually next to the kitchen, that is used to store food that does not h ave to be kept cold – that does not have to be refrigerated. A “pantry” usually has  “dry goods,” like sugar and flour and salt – things you don’t have to put in a refrigerator.

A pantry would probably also have “canned food.” “C anned food” is food that comes in a metal container – usually made of metal,  of tin. Canned foods are very popular in the United States for all sorts of things, including soups and vegetables and other kinds of food. Canned foods are very convenient because you can buy them and then put them in your pantry a nd use them many weeks, or even months, later. A “jar” (jar) is a glass bot tle that has a top on it, which we call a “lid” (lid). “Jars” are also used for storin g things – for putting things into, including food.

Walt says, “Nearly everything we’ve cooked in the p ast year” – in the last 12 months – “has been premixed.” “To mix” (mix) is to combine different things together, to put things together. “Premixed” would be food, in this case, that has already been prepared and put together so you don’t  have to do it yourself. Walt says, “Are you sure you’re up to cooking a dinner f or 12 from scratch?” “To be up to” something here means to be ready for something,  to be prepared to do something, to have the energy and the knowledge to do something.

Usually we use the word “challenge” after this expr ession. “Are you up to the challenge?” “Challenge” is a difficult thing to do.  “Up to” can also be used to mean simply doing something. If someone says, “What  are you up to tonight?” he means “What are you doing tonight? What are your pl ans? What activities are you doing tonight?” “Up to” can also be used when s omeone is perhaps doing something wrong, even illegal. “I think my neighbor  is up to something” – I think that there is something strange going on, maybe eve n criminal. I think that’s true. I really do wonder what my neighbor is up to someti mes. I don’t know. Strange smells. You know what I’m saying?

Ann says that she is up to cooking a dinner from sc ratch. She says, “How hard could it be?” That question, “How hard could it be? ” is used to indicate that you don’t think it is very difficult. You don’t think it will be difficult to do this. “How hard could it be to find a beautiful woman in Los Angele s and ask her out on a date?” Well, it’s actually quite easy to find a woman. Get ting her to go on the date – that’s a little more difficult.

Ann says, “I just need to make sure that the ingred ients I buy are fresh.” “Fresh” (fresh) is an adjective used to describe food that has only recently been prepared or has only recently been taken from where it would  normally be found. For example, a fish that is “fresh” is one that has bee n brought from the lake or the river or the ocean very recently. It’s not a fish t hat was caught four months ago and now they’re bringing it to the store. That woul d not be a fresh fish. If you want fresh fish, you often have to go to the river or the lake or the ocean to buy it, if you want it really fresh, right out of the water .

We can use this adjective also to describe foods th at are prepared – for example, “fresh bread.” “Fresh bread” would be bread that wa s baked or cooked very recently – maybe this morning or an hour ago. “Ingr edients” are the things you use to make food. So, “fresh ingredients” would be things that you use to prepare your food that are fresh. Ann says she also needs to “follow the recipes closely.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a list of instructions for c ooking or preparing something.

“To follow something closely” means to do it very c arefully, to do everything that it says. “Following a recipe closely” would mean do ing everything the recipe says, in the order it says to do it. Ann also wants  to make sure that she uses “plenty” – or a lot – “of fresh herbs and spices.” “Herbs and spices” are small parts of plants, often dried, that have a lot of fl avor in them. We use herbs and spices to give more flavor to the food.

Ann also says she needs to “multitask” (multitask).  “To multitask” is to do many things at the same time. Walt says, “You mean do a juggling act?” “To juggle” (juggle) is to throw a lot of things up into the ai r and keep them all in the air to prevent them from falling, from dropping to the flo or. However, here when Walt says a “juggling act,” he’s referring to something that is very complex, something that will require doing a lot of things at the same  time. The idea here is that this would be very difficult to do because juggling can be difficult to do.

Walt says, “It’ll take a lot of work and organizati on to pull this off.” “To pull something off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be able to do something that is very difficult or that is very challenging.  Ann says, however, that she is “up to the challenge.” She is able to do this difficult  thing. “And,” she says, “I have a backup plan.” A “backup (backup) plan” is an altern ative if what you’re doing now doesn’t work. It’s what we might also call “plan B. ” When people say, “I need a plan B,” they mean they need a backup plan. They ne ed a plan to follow if what they are planning on doing goes wrong. That would b e their “plan A,” their original or first plan.

Walt asks what Ann’s backup plan is. Ann tells him,  “Have you ever heard of the raw food movement?” “Raw” (raw) is the opposite of cooked. If you buy some tomatoes at the supermarket and you bring them home , they’re raw. They haven’t been cooked yet. In the last few years, it has become popular for some restaurants, and people in their homes, to not cook  food – to eat the food raw by preparing it in special ways.

There are, according to some people, health benefit s from this. I don’t know if that’s true. I do know that Ann is just making a jo ke here. She’s saying that her backup plan is not to cook the food at all and to s erve it, or to give it to her guests, raw.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I’m so excited to have the entire family comin g for a visit. For our first family dinner next Friday, I’m making everything from scra tch. I’m pulling out all the stops.

Walt: But have you ever made anything from scratch?

# Showing Immaturity

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode. This ep isode is a dialogue between Romero and Alice about someone who isn’t very matur e – who doesn’t act like an adult. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Romero: Are you going to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I?

Alice: You’d better tell her. I don’t think she’s g oing to take it well.

Romero: I’ll do it, but I’m not looking forward to it. She can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants.

Alice: Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with h er. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines. I don’t know why they don’t f ire her.

Romero: I think she’s just a little inexperienced. This is her first job, after all. Some of her behavior is pretty childish, but when s he’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about something, she does good work.

Alice: That’s like saying somebody is a good worker  when they’re not napping!

Romero: She’s not that bad, but we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our employees are so young.

Alice: Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors selling to teenagers.

Romero: I think that would open a whole different can of worms!

[end of dialogue]

Romero begins our dialogue by saying, “Are you goin g to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I?” Romer o is asking Alice if she is going to tell someone named Amber that she cannot h ave Saturday off of work. “To have a day off of work” means that you don’t ha ve to work that day. “I have Saturday off of work” means I do not have to work o n Saturday. Sometimes we just use the preposition “off” – “I have Saturday o ff.” That means I do not have to work on Saturday. Romero is asking Alice if she’s g oing to tell Amber that she cannot have Saturday off of work.

Alice says, “You better tell her,” meaning you shou ld tell her, or it would be better that you told her. Alice says, “I don’t think she’s  going to take it well.” “To take something well” or “to take something very well” me ans to receive bad news calmly, without complaining. If someone tells you b ad news and you go, “Well, okay. I’m sorry to hear it. But that’s okay,” you a re taking the news calmly. Romero then says, “I’ll do it,” meaning I will tell  her, “but I’m not looking forward to it” – it’s not something I want to do. “She,” me aning Amber, “can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants.”

“Mature” (mature) normally means acting like an adu lt. To describe someone as “mature” means that they act like an adult, not lik e a child. Mature can also mean old in some circumstances, but here we are using it  in the sense of someone who acts responsibly, acts like an adult. The oppos ite of mature would be “immature.” We often say that children and adolesce nts are “immature.” They’re not mature. They don’t act like an adult. They don’ t act responsibly sometimes.

Alice says, “Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with her. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines.” Alice is describing Amb er here. She says that if things don’t go Amber’s way, “she pouts and whines. ” When we say something “goes your way” (way), we mean it happens in a way that you want it to happen. If you are hoping that a certain baseball team wins  the World Series, the championship, next year (say, for example, the Los Angeles Dodgers), and they win the championship – they win the World Series – then you can say, “Well, things went my way,” meaning they turned out or the y had the result that you wanted them to have.

Alice says that if Amber doesn’t have things go her  way, “she pouts and whines.” “To pout” (pout) means physically to take your lowe r lip and put it down in a way that indicates that you are unhappy or sad. When so meone does that, especially a child, we would say they’re pouting. They’re feel ing perhaps sorry for themselves, and they’re trying to show other people  that they are unhappy. Normally, it’s something that a child does. An adul t could also “pout,” although

they may not actually change the expression on thei r face to do so. “Pouting” is usually considered something that children do, and therefore an immature act.

“To whine” (whine) means to make loud noises when y ou are complaining about something, when you don’t like something. You say t hings out loud that indicate that you don’t like the situation. We often associa te whining with a high-pitched voice: “Oh, I don’t want to go to the store, Dad.” That would be a little child whining. Once again, whining, like pouting, is cons idered immature – not something an adult should do. Well, we don’t want o ur children to do it either, but we can at least understand it if they do because th ey are not mature yet.

Alice says, “I don’t know why they don’t fire her.”  “To fire” (fire) means to tell someone that they no longer work at the place where  they were working. “To fire” means to get rid of an employee. Romero says, “I th ink she’s just a little inexperienced.” “To be experienced” means to have a  long time working with a certain project or a certain kind of job. “To be in experienced” means to not have a lot of time doing that particular activity. Romer o thinks that Amber is inexperienced; she’s not experienced.

He says, “This is her first job, after all. Some of  her behavior is pretty childish, but when she’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about s omething, she does good work.” “To be childish” (childish) means to act lik e a child, not like an adult. “To kick up a fuss” (fuss) means to do something or say  something to indicate that you are not happy with the situation – to complain about something in such a way that you are trying to bother other people, or you are trying to get them angry, perhaps.

“To kick up a fuss” means to complain loudly in suc h a way that you are trying to cause what we might call a “scene” (scene). You’re trying to get other people to notice you. People “kick up a fuss” because they wa nt someone to do something the way they want it, and when the situation is suc h that things are not going their way, they do this sort of complaining in order to g et the person to do what they want them to do.

“To moan” (moan) is similar to the verb “to whine.”  It means to complain, but instead of complaining in a high-pitched voice, “mo aning” usually refers to people who complain in a low voice. “Ah, I’m really angry.  I’m not happy” – that’s “to moan.” A “moan” can also be simply a sound that you  make when you are disappointed or upset about something. If your favo rite baseball team loses the World Series, you may go, “Ohh!” That is also “moan ing.” Here, it really just means “complaining.” Romero then describes Amber as  sometimes being

“pretty” – or very – “childish.” “But when she’s no t kicking up a fuss or moaning” – when she’s not complaining – “she does good work,” Romero says.

Alice says, “That’s like saying somebody is a good worker when they’re not napping.” “To nap” means to sleep for a short perio d of time during the day, when you wouldn’t normally be sleeping. Actually, many p eople say that napping in the afternoon for 30 minutes or an hour is actually goo d for you. You’re able to get more done. You have more energy in the late afterno ons and evenings if you do that. Alice is making a joke here. She’s saying tha t Romero’s description of Amber – as someone who does good work when she’s no t complaining – is like describing someone as a good worker when they’re no t sleeping.

Romero says, “She’s not that bad,” meaning she’s no t really bad. “But we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our emp loyees are so young.” “To look past” something means not to pay attention to something so that you can focus on something more important. If someone is ma king small mistakes, but is overall doing a good job, we will probably look pas t his or her mistakes. We won’t worry about them because we know there’s something more important.

“Juvenile” (juvenile) is normally used as a synonym  for “immature.” “Juvenile” describes someone who is not an adult. Usually, the  word is used when we’re talking about teenagers. As an adjective, it’s usua lly used to describe an immature action, and that’s how the dialogue is usi ng it here. Romero says that “we do have to look past some juvenile antics.” “An tics” (antics) are actions that are not appropriate – that are immature, in a way. “Juvenile antics,” then, would describe actions that are childish or that you woul d not expect of someone who was mature.

Alice says, “Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors se lling to teenagers.” “Seniors” (seniors) are people who are old, people who usuall y are over the age of 65 or 70 – maybe 75 nowadays. As people live longer and l onger, the definition of “young” and “old” changes over time. I hope it keep s changing so I’m never old, but someday I will be a senior. “Teenagers” describ e people who are between the ages usually of 13 and 20.

Romero says, “I think that would open a whole diffe rent can of worms!” Alice is suggesting that instead of having teenagers working  for them, they have seniors working for them. Romero thinks that there would be  other problems if that happened, and that’s why he uses the expression “op en a whole different can of worms” (worms). The expression “to open a can of wo rms” or “a whole new can of worms” means to start talking about and getting involved in a new problem.

You already have one problem, and now you are going  to create a different kind of problem, and that’s what Romero is saying.

Having seniors working for their company instead of  teenagers would not necessarily be a better thing, because it may creat e different kinds of problems, but still just as serious as the ones they’re havin g now.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Romero: Are you going to tell Amber that she can’t have Saturday off of work or should I?

Alice: You’d better tell her. I don’t think she’s g oing to take it well.

Romero: I’ll do it, but I’m not looking forward to it. She can be really immature when she doesn’t get what she wants.

Alice: Yeah, that’s why I don’t like working with h er. If things don’t go her way, she pouts and whines. I don’t know why they don’t f ire her.

Romero: I think she’s just a little inexperienced. This is her first job, after all. Some of her behavior is pretty childish, but when s he’s not kicking up a fuss or moaning about something, she does good work.

Alice: That’s like saying somebody is a good worker  when they’re not napping!

Romero: She’s not that bad, but we do have to look past some juvenile antics when our employees are so young.

Alice: Yeah, too bad we can’t have seniors selling to teenagers.

Romero: I think that would open a whole different can of worms!

On this episode, we are going to listen to a dialog ue between Sonia and Nadir about parts of the body. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: What in the world is that?!

Nadir: It’s a life-size figure of George Washington . It’s for Leon’s school project.

Sonia: Then why are you making it?

Nadir: I’m not. I’m just helping him.

Sonia: Uh-huh. Why does George Washington have real ly big hands and flat palms?

Nadir: He cut down the family’s cherry tree. Rememb er? He probably needed big hands to do that.

Sonia: And why does he have little tiny feet with s ix toes on each foot and no ankles?

Nadir: I made a little mistake with those, but they ’ll be covered up with shoes, so no one will see them.

Sonia: And why is George’s head shaped like an egg?  His ears are lopsided and his earlobes are disproportionate to his other faci al features.

 Nadir: That’s why I made the forehead and chin bigg er, so no one will notice those ears. We’ll probably put a hat on him anyway.

Sonia: But his legs look really thin on top and thi ck on the bottom, with kneecaps that stick out.

Nadir: I’ll put pants on him, so no one will see th ose either.

Sonia: So it won’t matter if he’s not anatomically correct, right?

Nadir: Right.

Sonia: Good thing this isn’t for science class!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Sonia asking Nadir a que stion. She says, “What in the world is that?” When someone uses that expressi on “in the world,” they are trying to give you the idea that they are shocked o r surprised about something. “What in the world are you doing?” you might say to  your child, for example, if he is doing something that you don’t want him to do, o r if you are simply puzzled. You don’t understand why someone is doing something  – you may say, “What in the world are you doing?” There’s an implication in  this question that you find what they are doing as strange or unusual.

Nadir responds, “It’s a life-size figure of George Washington. It’s for Leon’s school project.” When we say something is a “life-s ize figure” (and you might also hear people say “life-sized” with a “d” at the end,  “figure” – either one is correct) we mean that they have some sort of statue or objec t that is the same size as the person that the object represents. So, a “life-size  statue” or a “life-size figure” of George Washington would be something that looks lik e George Washington and is as big as George Washington was. You may know th at George Washington was the first president of United States.

Nadir for some reason has a life-size figure of Geo rge Washington. Why? He says it is “for Leon’s school project.” We’re guess ing that Leon is Nadir’s son. Sonia says, “Then why are you making it?” Why isn’t  Leon making it, since it’s for his school project or assignment. Nadir says, “I’m not. I’m just helping him.” Sonia doesn’t believe Nadir. She says, “Uh-huh.” Bu t she says it in such a way that we know she doesn’t really think that Nadir is  telling the truth.

She then asks, “Why does George Washington have rea lly big hands and flat palms?” Your “hand” (hand) is at the end of your ar m and is used for grabbing things and picking things up. “Palm” (palm) is the area of your hand which is between the bottom of the hand and the finger. So, between basically your wrist (which is the part of the body that connects the ar m to the hand) and the fingers of your hand – that flat area on the front of your hand is called your “palm.”

Sonia wants to know why George Washington has “real ly big hands and flat palms.” “Flat” means there aren’t any bumps in it. It’s completely straight, if you will. Nadir says, “He cut down the family’s cherry tree, remember? He probably needed big hands to do that.” Nadir refers to an ol d story about George Washington, who, when he was a boy, apparently cut down a tree, a cherry tree.

The story is that when his father asked him if he c ut down the tree, George was honest. He admitted, “Yes. I cut down that cherry t ree.” This story was meant to demonstrate the honesty of George Washington, how h e was a good man. Nadir thinks that since Washington cut down a tree, he mu st’ve had really big hands. It makes sense, I think.

Sonia then says, “Why does he have little tiny feet  with six toes on each foot and no ankles?” Sonia says that this life-size figure of George Washington has “tiny” feet, meaning very small feet. Your “feet,” of cour se, are the things that you walk on. The figure also has six toes. Your “toes” (toes ) are the “digits,” we might call them, that are at the ends of your feet. They’re so rt of like your fingers, but they’re on your feet. We call those “toes.” There a re normally five toes on each feet, just as there are five fingers on each hand. However, this figure of George Washington has six toes, and it doesn’t have any an kles.

Your “ankle” (ankle) is the part that connects your  leg to your foot, just as your “wrist” (wrist) connects your arm to your hand. Nad ir says, “I made a little mistake” – a small mistake – “but they’ll be covere d up with shoes, so no one will see them.” Sonia then asks, “And why is George’s he ad shaped like an egg?” Your “head” is the part of your body that contains your brain (or, in the case of my neighbor, no brain), your eyes, your nose, your ears, and so forth. And your hair, if you have hair. Sonia is asking why George Washington’s head is “shaped like,” or in the form of, “an egg.”

The ears, Sonia says, “are lopsided and the earlobe s are disproportionate to his other facial features.” Your “ears” (ears) are the things that you hear out of. When we say something is “lopsided” (lopsided) we mean it is uneven. One side is longer than the other, in this case. “Earlobes” (ea rlobes) are the bottom parts of your ears, the part that is below the ear opening w here you have the sound go

into your ear. Below that part, there is a small pi ece of flesh that we call the “earlobe.” It’s where you would put earrings, for e xample, if you have earrings.

I don’t have any earrings myself. Maybe I should. M aybe I should get earrings. What do you think? Well, back to our story here.

The earlobes, according to Sonia, on George Washing ton’s figure are “disproportionate to his other facial features.” Wh en we say something is “disproportionate” (disproportionate), we mean that  they look too big or too small compared to the other things, in this case, on the figure. When something is “disproportionate,” it is bigger than it should be.  For example, if you draw someone’s face and you make the nose five times big ger than the eyes, we would say the nose is disproportionate to the eyes – it’s too big compared to the size of the eyes. “Dis” (dis) here means “not.” So,  “disproportionate” means not proportionate.

The earlobes, then, are not the right size compared  to the other facial features. “Facial (facial) features” are the parts of your fa ce that are used to, basically, identify you – the parts of your face that make you  look the way you do. So, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your eyebrows – which are the lines of hair above your eyes – all of these would be considered “facia l features.”

Nadir says, “That’s why I made the forehead and chi n bigger, so no one will notice those ears.” The “forehead” (forehead) is the part of the head that is above your eyebrows and below where your hair begins – be low the top of your head, if you will. It’s the flat part of your face above you r eyes. The “chin” (chin) is the part of your face that is below your mouth and abov e your neck, formed by your “jaw” (jaw), which is where you find your teeth. Th at bottom part of your face, then, is called your chin. Many men, for example, g row beards that cover their chins. I don’t have a beard. Maybe I should get a b eard – a beard and earrings. Yeah. Why not?

Sonia continues, “But his legs look really thin on top and thick on the bottom, with kneecaps that stick out.” Your legs connect your fe et to the rest of your body, we could say. You have two of them. “Kneecaps” (kneeca ps) are small round bones found in the middle of your leg towards the front of the leg, above your “knee,” which is the part of the leg that bends. You could think of it as the part of the leg that connects the top part with the bottom part. On  your arms, you have what’s called an “elbow” (elbow), which connects the top p art of your arm to the bottom part of your arm.

Sonia says that George Washington’s legs are “thin on top and thick on the bottom.” “Thin” is the opposite of “thick.” “Thin” would be very narrow, and “thick,” in this case, would be very wide. Nadir says, “I’ll  put pants on him, so no one will see those either.” Sonia says, “So, it won’t matter  if he’s anatomically correct, right?” “Anatomically” comes from the word “anatomy ” (anatomy), which is the study of the human body, the physical aspects of the human body.

“Anatomically” refers to the parts of the body, the  physical nature of your body. It could be a human body. It could be a body of an ani mal. To say something is “anatomically correct” means that it is just like a  real body. We would use this in describing perhaps a painting or, in this case, a l ife-size figure where it’s supposed to represent exactly what the body contain s. That’s why Sonia is saying that it won’t matter if George is not anatom ically correct. Nadir says, “Yes, that’s correct” – that’s right.

Sonia says, “Good thing this isn’t for science clas s!” Sonia says “good thing,” meaning it is a good thing, or it is fortunate, tha t this isn’t for science class. In a science class, of course, you would want the figure  to be anatomically correct so that you know the student understands the different  parts of the body and where they go and how big they are.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sonia: What in the world is that?!

Nadir: It’s a life-size figure of George Washington . It’s for Leon’s school project.

Sonia: Then why are you making it?

Nadir: I’m not. I’m just helping him.

Sonia: Uh-huh. Why does George Washington have real ly big hands and flat palms?

Nadir: He cut down the family’s cherry tree. Rememb er? He probably needed big hands to do that.

Sonia: And why does he have little tiny feet with s ix toes on each foot and no ankles?

Nadir: Right.

Sonia: Good thing this isn’t for science class!

# Getting Access to Restricted Areas

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 978 – Getting Access to Restricted Areas.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 978. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and download a Learning Guide for this episode. You can do that after you become a member of ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialogue between a security offic er – someone who tries to guard things or prevent people from using things th at they’re not supposed to – and Carl. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Security officer: Excuse me, sir, but this is a res tricted area. Only authorized personnel are permitted.

Carl: I just want to take a quick look. Is this rea lly where the president will be speaking?

Security officer: I can neither confirm nor deny th at, sir. Please step aside.

Carl: What if I have press credentials? Could I get  in then?

Security officer: Only if you’ve been screened by s ecurity. Really, sir, I must ask you to leave this area. It’s off-limits to you.

Carl: Couldn’t I just hang around and watch while p eople arrive? I won’t say a word.

Security officer: No, and if you persist, I’ll have  to have you shown out.

Carl: I’m not causing any trouble. I’m an American citizen and this is a free country! I can stand wherever I want to.

Security officer: Not on private property. Jim, cou ld you please escort this gentleman off the premises?

Carl: Hey, this is a travesty! I’m going to file a formal protest!

Security officer: You do that. Just do it off the p remises.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with a security officer talking  to a man named Carl. “Security” (security) refers to safety or keeping t hings safe – making sure that secret things remain or stay secret. This is a “sec urity officer,” a person whose job it is to protect a certain area. She says, “Exc use me, sir, but this is a restricted area.” Notice the use of the word “sir” (sir) here. “Sir” is a polite, formal way of talking to – or “addressing,” we might say –  a man. If it were a woman, we might say “ma’am,” as in “Excuse me, ma’am.”

She says, “This is a restricted area.” Something th at is “restricted” (restricted) is something – or in this case, an area – that only ce rtain people are allowed to use or go into. “Only authorized personnel are permitte d,” the security officer says. “To be authorized” (authorized) means to have permi ssion to do something, to be able to do something because someone has told you y ou are able to do it. “Personnel” (personnel) is another word for employe es, or people who work for a certain organization. “Authorized personnel” would be people in this organization that have permission to, in this case, go into a sp ecific area. “Permitted” here means allowed.

“Only authorized personnel are permitted,” the secu rity officer says. Carl says, “I just want to take a quick look. Is this really wher e the president will be speaking?” We’re not sure which president Carl is referring to , perhaps the president of the United States. The security officer says, “I can ne ither confirm nor deny that, sir. Please step aside.” This is a very formal expressio n. “To confirm or deny” means to say, “Yes, this is true” or “No, this isn’t true .” Government officials who are trying to keep something secret will sometimes use this expression, “I can neither confirm nor deny.” That means I cannot confirm and I cannot deny. I can’t say yes and I can’t say no.

The security officer asks Carl to “step aside,” mea ning move from where you are standing right now. Usually, “step aside” means to move to the left or to the right to get out of someone’s way. Carl says, “What if I have press credentials?” “Press” (press) refers to newspapers, magazines, ra dio, and television stations, Internet websites – anyone or any organization that  reports the news, that provides information to other people about some eve nt. The word “credentials” (credentials) refers to badges or cards perhaps tha t indicate, in this case, that you are a journalist.

 Usually, when you have a large public event where the media or the press want to report on the story, the members of the press – the “reporters” they are sometimes called – are given badges or pieces of pa per that indicate that they have permission to be there. Carl wants to know if he could “get in” – if he could enter into this area – if he had press credentials.  The security officer answers him by saying, “Only if you have been screened by secur ity.” “To be screened” (screened) means to be examined or checked for some thing.

When you go to an airport, before you can go into the airport to get on your plane, you have to be screened. They have to look a t you. Sometimes, they put you through a special machine to make sure that you ’re not carrying anything dangerous. The word “security” in this sentence is a noun, not an adjective as it is in the term “security officer.” As a noun, “secu rity” refers to the people who are responsible, in this case, for screening people, for checking – or investigating – on someone. Carl is told that he would need to be s creened by security.

Then the security officer says, “Really, sir, I mus t ask you to leave this area.” The security officer is trying to be polite but very in sistent with Carl. She says, “I must ask you” – I have to ask you now – “to leave this a rea.” She says, “It’s off-limits to you.” If something is “off-limits,” it is not allow ed. It is not permitted. We often use that in talking about a physical area. A parent may  tell his or her child that a certain area in the house is off-limits; they’re no t allowed to go in there.

Carl, however, does not leave. He says instead, “Co uldn’t I just hang around and watch while people arrive? I won’t say a word.” “To  hang around” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend time in an area, either relax ing or not doing anything very important. It means to remain, however, in that are a. “I’m going to hang around until my friend shows up” – until my friend arrives ; I’m going to stay here until my friend arrives. The security officer tells Carl tha the cannot hang around.

She says, “If you persist, I’ll have to have you sh own out.” “To persist” (persist) means to continue to do something despite difficult ies, even though it is hard to do it. Another way of saying this would be “to not give up” – to not stop doing what you’re doing. The security officer says, “If y ou persist,” meaning if you stay here, “I’ll have to have you shown out.” “To be sho wn (shown) out” is a polite way of saying to be made to leave, to have someone come  and perhaps even physically remove you from an area where you are no t supposed to be.

Carl says, “I’m not causing any trouble. I’m an Ame rican citizen and this is a free country! I can stand wherever I want to.” Carl says  he’s an “American citizen.” A “citizen” is a person who is officially a member, i f you will, of a country. Carl says,

“This is a free country!” A “free country” would be  a nation where people are allowed to do what they want, within certain limits . We use this expression in the United States here, often to simply refer to a situ ation where someone perhaps is trying to restrict our actions or tell us there are  things that we cannot do that we believe we have the legal right to do.

So, if someone says, “Well, you can’t criticize the  government,” you can say, “Well, yes, I can. It’s a free country.” “Free” her e relates to freedom, not to the idea that something doesn’t cost any money. We some times use this expression jokingly, or in a way that indicates to another per son that he can do whatever he wants – he doesn’t need your permission or approval  to do what he wants.

So, if someone says, “Well, I’m going to go down to  the beach and sit in the sun all day, even though I may get burned,” you can say , “Well, it’s a free country. Go ahead.” There’s a little bit of the idea there that  you don’t agree with that or you don’t think that’s a good idea. You might even thin k it’s a stupid idea, but you say it to the person as a way of saying, “Well, if that ’s your choice, then go ahead and do that.” Here, Carl is using the phrase more to say that he has a right to do this. The security officer says that he does not have a r ight. She says, “Not on private property.”

“Private property” is land or a building that belon gs to someone other than the government. If it belongs to the government, it wou ld be public property. The security officer says that Carl has no right to sta nd on private property unless he has permission. Then she turns to, or looks at, ano ther security officer by the name of Jim and says, “Jim, could you please escort  this gentleman off the premises.” “To escort” (escort) means to go with so meone, “to accompany” someone, we might say. “Off the premises” (premises ) means away from this particular area, away from this particular location .

Carl was not happy. He says, “Hey, this is a traves ty!” A “travesty” (travesty) is something that is very bad, especially something th at has not turned out how you expected it to turn out. Carl says, “I’m going to f ile a formal protest.” A “protest” (protest) here refers to a complaint. A “formal pro test” would be an official complaint where you write a letter or you go talk to someone complaining about the way someone acted or someone behaved.

The security officer says, “You do that.” That expr ession “you do that,” said in that particular way, indicates to the person that y ou don’t really care what they do. You’re not concerned. Often we say this when so meone threatens us or someone says they’re going to get us in trouble. “I ’m going to talk to your brother and I’m going to tell him all the things you’ve don e.” You could say, “Well, you do

that.” You’re indicating that you don’t care about this and that you’re not frightened by this action.

The security officer says, “Just do it off the prem ises,” meaning file your complaint somewhere else – you have to leave this a rea, these premises.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Security officer: Excuse me, sir, but this is a res tricted area. Only authorized personnel are permitted.

Carl: I just want to take a quick look. Is this rea lly where the president will be speaking?

Security officer: I can neither confirm nor deny th at, sir. Please step aside.

Carl: What if I have press credentials? Could I get  in then?

Security officer: Only if you’ve been screened by s ecurity. Really, sir, I must ask you to leave this area. It’s off-limits to you.

Carl: Couldn’t I just hang around and watch while p eople arrive? I won’t say a word.

Security officer: No, and if you persist, I’ll have  to have you shown out.

Carl: I’m not causing any trouble. I’m an American citizen and this is a free country! I can stand wherever I want to.

Security officer: Not on private property. Jim, cou ld you please escort this gentleman off the premises?

Carl: Hey, this is a travesty! I’m going to file a formal protest!

Security officer: You do that. Just do it off the p remises.

This episode is a dialogue between Kyle and Paulina  about kinds of humor – things that make you laugh. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kyle: Are you watching that sitcom again? It’s so s tupid. There’s nothing witty or original about the humor.

Paulina: I don’t need highbrow jokes. I enjoy all k inds of comedy.

Kyle: You mean you like screwball and slapstick hum or.

Paulina: Yes, so?

Kyle: So? It’s so juvenile.

Paulina: I know that it’s hard for people like you who like satire to appreciate the more wacky kinds of humor, but you might try gettin g off your high horse once in a while.

Kyle: I’m not snooty. I’m just discriminating. I li ke comedians with a dry sense of humor like that self-deprecating guy on that show I  watch.

Paulina: That show is a snoozefest. That guy bores me to death.

Kyle: And this show does it for you?

Paulina: You bet.

Kyle: There’s no accounting for taste!

 [end of dialogue]

Kyle begins our dialogue by saying to Paulina, “Are  you watching that sitcom again? It’s so stupid.” A “sitcom” (sitcom) is a te levision show with a single group of characters, a single group of people, who do thi ngs that are supposed to be funny. If you remember the television show Friends , for example, which was popular in many countries around the world a few ye ars ago, then you know what a sitcom is. “Sitcom” is actually short for “situat ion comedy” – a comedy where you have the same people in different situations ea ch week.

Kyle thinks this sitcom is “stupid,” meaning it’s n ot very funny; it’s dumb. “There’s nothing witty or original about the humor,” Kyle sa ys. “Witty” (witty) means funny, but in an intelligent way – not funny just because somebody falls down or just because somebody says something stupid. “Witty” is an adjective used to describe humor that is clever, that is intelligent.  Kyle says, “There is nothing witty or original about the humor” – about the things tha t you are supposed to laugh at in the sitcom.

Paulina says, “I don’t need highbrow jokes. I enjoy  all kinds of comedy.” A “joke” is something that is told to make you laugh – usual ly a short story, often just a sentence or two. “Highbrow” (highbrow) refers to so mething that is more intelligent or sophisticated than the average perso n or the average, in this case, joke. “Highbrow” refers to things that are very int ellectual in nature, things that people think are very intelligent. Paulina says she  does not need highbrow jokes.

She enjoys all kinds of “comedy” (comedy). “Comedy”  is a category of movies or television shows or theatrical plays or anything, r eally, that makes you laugh. The category of comedy includes anything that is suppos ed to be funny. Kyle says, “You mean you like screwball and slapstick humor?” “Screwball” (screwball) is a somewhat old-fashioned term nowadays to refer to co medies that are silly. We might use also the adjective “goofy” (goofy) – the sorts of things that a child might laugh at. A lot of comedies by one of the great com edians of the twentieth century, Jerry Lewis, were screwball comedies – sil ly comedies.

“Slapstick (slapstick) humor” is humor that involve s physical actions. Someone walking down the street and suddenly falling – that  is slapstick humor. When you laugh at someone’s actions rather than what they are saying, especially if those actions involve falling down or doing something str ange with their body, that would be slapstick humor. Paulina says, “Yes” – she likes this kind of humor – “so?”

We use that word “so” as a question when we are say ing to the other person that you don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. F or example, you say to your wife, “This is the third time this week that we hav e had dinner at McDonald’s.” The idea behind this statement is that you’re not h appy about that, or you think that this is strange. Your wife, however, may say, “So?” When she says that, she’s saying that there is no problem with that – t hat there should be no complaint related to that fact. You could also say,  “So what?” meaning “Why is that important?” Paulina says, “Yes, so?”

Kyle says, “So?” The way that Kyle responds to Paul ina’s “So?” by saying “So?” indicates that he’s surprised that she doesn’t thin k this is important. He’s surprised at the fact that she doesn’t think there’ s anything wrong with what they were just talking about. Kyle says, “These comedies  are so juvenile.” “To be juvenile” (juvenile) means to be immature – somethi ng you would expect out of a child or teenager, not from an adult.

Paulina says, “I know that it’s hard for people lik e you who like satire to appreciate the more wacky kinds of humor, but you m ight try getting off your high horse once in a while.” “Satire” (satire) is a type  of humor that copies or exaggerates something else to make fun of it. It’s a kind of humor that sometimes can be done in a mean way, in a negative way, to ma ke people laugh at something, but often to make them think about why t his is a strange thing and why perhaps we should change it.

“Satire” is a kind of humor that is also a commenta ry on the way that we live our lives, often a negative commentary that is, of cour se, also meant to be funny. Paulina says that Kyle likes satire, which some peo ple might consider a more intelligent kind of humor, but that she likes wacky  kinds of humor. “Wacky” (wacky) is similar to screwball comedy. It’s comedy  that is silly – the sort of thing that a young child might find funny. As an adjectiv e, “wacky” also means crazy, weird, unpredictable, unexpected.

Paulina says that Kyle should try getting off his h igh horse once in a while. The expression “to get off your high horse” means to st op acting superior, to stop thinking that you are better than other people. If you can imagine someone on a horse riding by people who are walking, you get the  idea that the person on the horse is higher, and perhaps thinks that he’s bette r than the people down below who are walking. Paulina is telling Kyle that he sh ould not act so superior about what kind of humor he likes.

Kyle says, “I’m not snooty. I’m just discriminating .” “To be snooty” (snooty) means to be mean to others because you think you are better than they are.

Another word we might use here is “snobby” (snobby) . A “snob” (snob) is a person who thinks that they’re better than other pe ople. A more informal way of saying this is “to be stuck (stuck) up.” “Stuck up”  is an expression you would probably hear more often in high school among young  people, but you could also use it in this case as well.

Kyle says he is “discriminating.” “To be discrimina ting” here means to be selective. “To discriminate” can be a positive thin g: I am very picky, I’m very choosy, I’m very selective about the things that I like. I don’t like everything; I like only certain things. “Discriminate” can also be use d in a negative way to refer to the treatment of someone based on perhaps the color  of their skin or their sex (whether they’re male or female). That sort of “dis criminating” is a bad thing, we usually believe. However, here it’s used to mean se lective.

Kyle says, “I like comedians with a dry sense of hu mor like that self-deprecating guy on that show I watch.” A “dry (dry) sense of hu mor” is comedy that is considered perhaps a little bit more intellectual. A “dry sense of humor” would involve jokes that someone tells you in perhaps eve n a serious way. You have to then figure out that it’s supposed to be funny. Tha t’s the general idea here.

Kyle says he likes a certain comedian who is self-d eprecating. “To be self- deprecating” means to say bad things about yourself , but doing it in such a way that you are, in this case, being funny. “Self-depr ecating” is usually considered a good quality in someone, not just someone who’s try ing to be funny. If we say, “This man is self-deprecating,” we mean that he doe sn’t think he is superior to other people. He understands that he’s not perfect.  He recognizes his faults and problems.

Paulina says that this particular show that Kyle wa tches is “a snoozefest.” “To snooze” (snooze) means to sleep. “Fest” (fest) here  relates to a festival, a celebration. However, when Paulina uses this word, combining “snooze” with “fest,” she’s making a joke. She’s saying this show  is very boring. This show is not interesting. This show will make you fall aslee p it’s so boring. In fact, the next thing Paulina says is, “That guy bores me to death. ” “To bore (bore) someone to death” means to make someone feel very bored, to ma ke someone feel very uninterested.

Kyle says, “And this show does it for you?” The exp ression “to do it for you” here means to satisfy you, to give you something that yo u are looking for. Some people, for example, like to go to Disneyland becau se they like to ride on the big rides. That doesn’t do it for me, meaning that’s no t something I like to do. I last

went to Disneyland when I was nine years old. It’s not something I enjoy doing. Paulina says, “You bet,” meaning yes, this show doe s it for me; I like this show.

Kyle then says, “There’s no accounting for taste.” This is an old expression. “There is no accounting (accounting) for taste (tas te)” is used when another person has very different likes and dislikes from y ou. It’s used when another person likes certain things that you don’t like and  that you don’t think anyone, perhaps, should like. However, you don’t want to co ntinue talking about it, perhaps, or you don’t want to continue criticizing the other person. So you say, somewhat insultingly, really, “There’s no accountin g for taste,” meaning everyone has things that they like and dislike and there, in  a sense, is no real rational way for explaining why some people like some things and  other people like other things.

However, when you say this expression, you are sort  of insulting the other person. You’re saying, “Well, you have really bad t aste” – that is, you have very bad preferences. You like things that you shouldn’t  like, but there’s no way for me to explain that. That’s what’s meant by the phrase “there is no accounting for” something – there’s no way of trying to explain it,  and so I won’t try.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kyle: Are you watching that sitcom again? It’s so s tupid. There’s nothing witty or original about the humor.

Paulina: I don’t need highbrow jokes. I enjoy all k inds of comedy.

This episode is a dialogue between Wanda and George  about living in another country after you retire. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wanda: I just heard the news. You’re moving to McQu illanland?

George: I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad.

Wanda: Why?

George: It makes a lot of sense for people with a f ixed income. Social Security will only go so far here, but the cost of living is  much lower in other countries, including McQuillanland. I can live it up at a frac tion of the cost of living modestly here.

Wanda: But you’re moving away from all of your frie nds and family.

George: I can stay in touch remotely, and there is an American expat community there so I can make new friends. I am a little worr ied about learning the language and adjusting to life abroad, but I’ll be living a simpler life there and there’ll be less stress.

Wanda: But sometimes things aren’t so reliable when  you live abroad.

George: Like what?

Wanda: I’ve heard that the Internet services can be  unreliable and power outages are common in McQuillanland. Are you sure y ou want to put down stakes in a foreign country?

George: What do I have to lose? I already have my r esidency visa and a condo on the beach waiting for me. The real question is: when are you going to take the plunge?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Wanda saying to George, “I  just heard the news” – I just received this information. “You’re moving to M cQuillanland?” George says, “I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad.” “To retire” (re tire) is to stop working, usually later in your life when you already have enough money and you no longer have to work anymore. “Abroad” (abroad) is a term we use  to describe other countries – another country, not your own country. If you tra vel abroad, you go to different countries when you travel. If you retire abroad, yo u go to live in a different country after you’ve finished your work.

Wanda says, “Why?” George says, “It makes a lot of sense for people with a fixed income.” “It makes a lot of sense” (sense) me ans it is logical. It is something that seems reasonable. “Fixed income” describes a s ituation where you only receive a certain amount of money each month, usual ly because you have retired and are not getting money from a job.

You are instead getting money perhaps from what we would call a “pension” (pension), where a company or the government gives you money every month when you retire, or you have invested money – you h ave put your money in things like stocks and bonds and other ways of earn ing money with your money – and are taking money each month from that money you  have invested. That’s a “fixed income.” “Fixed” (fixed) means you don’t cha nge it. Once it’s established, once it is determined, it doesn’t change.

“Social Security,” George says, “will only go so fa r here, but the cost of living is much lower in other countries, including McQuillanl and.” “Social Security” is the name of the U.S. government program that gives mone y to people who are old, who have worked their entire life, and now need money to live on. Social Security also gives money to people who are disabled – that is, they don’t have the full use of their body for some reason, perhaps they hav e a disease or an illness, and they need help because they can’t work.

Normally, Social Security refers to people who have  worked and have given the government money throughout their life, and now get  that money or some of that money back from the government. Often it’s more money than they gave to the government. That’s one of the problems with our Soc ial Security system. But, this dialogue is simply saying that the money that a ret ired person gets from this government program called Social Security will only  go so far. That expression, “to only go so far,” means that it is limited. Real ly, it means it’s not enough. It’s less than what you really need.

George says, “The cost of living is much lower in o ther countries.” The “cost of living” refers to the amount of money you need to s pend each month in order to live. That would include your rent for your apartme nt, your food, your transportation, your health insurance, your movies,  your Coca-Cola – all of these things could be part of your cost of living. George  says, “The cost of living is much lower” – is less – “in other countries.” This is something that a lot of American retirees realize, and for that reason they  decide to move to another country where it doesn’t cost as much money to live .

The majority of people, of course, don’t move to an other country after they retire, but there are some people who decide that this is a  good option for them. George says, “I can live it up at a fraction of the cost of living modestly here.” The expression “to live it up” means to live in a very enjoyable and fun way by spending usually lots of money. If you want to go o ut every night, and have a drink at a bar, and see a movie, and eat at a very nice restaurant, you would need to spend a lot of money, in a city like Los An geles, to be able to do that.

But if you move to another country where things are  cheaper, where the cost of living is lower, you can still have a good time. Yo u can live it up, but not have to pay very much money to do it. The expression “at a fraction (fraction) of the cost” means at a much lower price, much more cheaply. A “ fraction” is something like one-half or one-third or one-fifth. It is less than  one. So, if it’s at a fraction of the cost, it is at a much lower cost to you.

George says he “can live it up at a fraction of the  cost of living modestly here.” So, he’s telling you what cost he’s comparing this to. He’s comparing it to the cost of living it up here in the United States. He says that even living modestly here is more expensive than living it up in another  country. “Modestly” (modestly) here means without very much or not very much. “To live modestly” or “to spend modestly” is to use enough money so that you can li ve, but not live well. You don’t have a nice new car or a beautiful house. You  may live in a small apartment with a small car or no car at all. That would be li ving modestly.

Wanda says, “But you’re moving away from all of you r friends and family.” George says, “I can stay in touch” – I can stay in contact with, I can communicate with these people – “remotely, and there is an Amer ican expat community there so I can make new friends.” “Remotely” (remotely) m eans from a faraway place, from a long distance away. We talk about people wor king “remotely.” That usually means that instead of going to an office bu ilding where the company’s headquarters are, they work at their home or in ano ther city.

George says that in McQuillanland, “there is an Ame rican expat community.” “Expat” (expat) is a short form of the word “expatr iate.” An “expatriate” is a person who lives in another country, often for a lo ng time while working in that country. The person isn’t a visitor. They are livin g in the country, sometimes to work, but sometimes as what we would call a “retire e” (retiree), which is a person who has retired.

George says, “I am a little worried about learning the language and adjusting to life abroad, but I’ll be living a simpler life and there there’ll be less stress.” “To adjust to something” is to get used to something, to adapt to something, we might say. George is worried about learning the language of McQuillanland and adjusting to life in another country, but he says h e’ll be living a simpler life – a less complicated, less stressful life –in McQuillan land.

Wanda says, “But sometimes things aren’t so reliabl e when you live abroad.” “To be reliable” means you can depend on them. You can count on them. George says, “Like what?” Wanda says, “I’ve heard that the  Internet services can be unreliable and power outages are common in McQuilla nland.” A “power outage” (outage) is a period of time when you don’t have el ectricity. In some countries, it may happen that the electricity is only on during c ertain hours of the day. That would be what Wanda is talking about here.

She says, “Are you sure you want to put down stakes  in a foreign country?” The expression “to put down stakes” (stakes) means to s elect a new place to live, to select a location where you are going to live. When  I left Minnesota, I put down stakes in Los Angeles. This is where I decided I wa s going to live. George says, “What do I have to lose?” This is a common expressi on meaning there is no bad thing that can happen to me – there’s no negative c onsequence of doing this.

George says, “I already have my residency visa and a condo on the beach waiting for me.” “Residency” (residency) refers to living permanently in a certain place. A “visa” (visa) here means permission to ent er a country and to stay in that country. So, a “residency visa” refers to official permission from the country for you to go and live there. Not all countries, of cou rse, will allow you to come and

just live in their country for the rest of your lif e. But McQuillanland is different. They’ll take anyone who wants to go.

George says he has his “residency visa and a condo on the beach.” A “condo” is a condominium. It’s a kind of apartment that you ow n instead of rent. Although, you can buy a condominium and then rent it to anoth er person, of course. George says, “The real question is” – the most impo rtant question is – “when are you going to take the plunge?” “To take the plunge”  (plunge) is to start something that is difficult or challenging, especially if you  are unsure about it or nervous about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Wanda: I just heard the news. You’re moving to McQu illanland?

George: I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad.

Wanda: Why?

George: It makes a lot of sense for people with a f ixed income. Social Security will only go so far here, but the cost of living is  much lower in other countries, including McQuillanland. I can live it up at a frac tion of the cost of living modestly here.

# Diplomatic and Economic Sanctions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 981 – Diplomatic and Economic Sanctions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  981. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Andy and Marjorie about diplomatic and economic sanctions – when one country decides to punish another country or attempt to punish another countr y. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: Well, it’s happened.

Marjorie: What’s happened?

Andy: The U.S. has placed diplomatic and economic s anctions on McQuillanland. It’s about time! The McQuillanland government has v iolated international law for the last time!

Marjorie: That’s great, but what does it really mea n?

Andy: Well, it means that all high-level talks betw een the U.S. and McQuillanland have been called off, and the U.S. embassy is closi ng.

Marjorie: That sounds serious.

Andy: You bet it is, and that’s just the beginning.  With economic sanctions, there’ll be serious consequences for business and t rade. There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companies doing business there, and there’l l be a naval blockade to enforce it.

Marjorie: Wow, the McQuillanlanders have really don e it this time.

Andy: They have. What made them think they could th umb their noses at us and get away with it?

 Marjorie: I have no idea, but they’re about to find  out what the repercussions are when they flout international law!

[end of dialogue]

Andy says to Marjorie, “Well, it’s happened.” Marjo rie says, “What’s happened?” Andy says, “The U.S. has placed diplomatic and econ omic sanctions on McQuillanland.” “McQuillanland,” of course, is that  country that very few people have visited, but it’s really a very beautiful coun try, I’m told. “Diplomatic” (diplomatic) refers to things dealing with other co untries. “Diplomatic sanctions” (sanctions) refer to actions that a country takes i n order to show another country that they don’t like what that other country is doi ng. It could involve, for example, closing your country’s embassy in another country –  removing your country’s official representatives from that country.

“Economic sanctions” are usually financial penaltie s that are forced on a country. It may involve, for example, saying to the companie s in your country that they can’t sell to anyone in this other country. That’s a very common type of economic sanction. “Sanctions” are things that countries do to try to force other countries to change their policies, basically.

Andy says, “It’s about time.” That expression, “it’ s about time,” is used to show that you are happy that something has finally happe ned that you wanted to have happen. “It’s about time” is usually used when some thing should have happened a long time ago but hasn’t, and now, finally, it ha s happened. If you’ve been dating your girlfriend for many years and finally y ou ask her to marry you, your girlfriend and your girlfriend’s parents might say,  “It’s about time.” Well, in this case, it’s about time that the U.S. placed diplomat ic and economic sanctions on McQuillanland, according to Andy.

“The McQuillanland government,” Andy says, “has vio lated international law for the last time.” “To violate” (violate) means to bre ak a rule, to do something that is illegal or wrong. “International law” refers to law s that affect many different countries in many different parts of the world. “In ternational law” is something that requires everyone agree on what the law is. Th at, of course, is a rather serious problem many times, but in this case the Mc Quillanland government, according to Andy, “has violated international law”  – has broken the laws – “for the last time.”

The expression “for the last time” means they won’t  do it again, presumably because the U.S. is putting these sanctions on McQu illanland. Marjorie says,

“That’s great, but what does it really mean?” What is the consequence of this? Andy says, “Well, it means that all high-level talk s between the U.S. and McQuillanland have to be called off, and the U.S. E mbassy is closing.” “High- level talks” would be important discussions between  members of different governments at a very high level. That is, the pres ident, the vice president – the most important leaders of the country – are talking  to the most important leaders of another country.

“To be called off” is a phrasal verb meaning to be canceled, to have something ended even though it was planned or scheduled. If y ou and I decide to meet tomorrow for lunch, and I say, “Well, I’m going to have to call off our meeting,” that means I have to cancel our meeting. “To call o ff” is usually used for business or official meetings. You wouldn’t use that if you were going to meet your girlfriend tomorrow night. You wouldn’t say, “I hav e to call off our meeting.” You would have to say, “I have to cancel our meeting be cause . . .” and you have to then make up some excuse why you’re not going to me et your girlfriend. But that’s your problem.

Our problem is these sanctions against McQuillanlan d. Andy says, “The U.S. Embassy is closing” in McQuillanland. The “embassy”  (embassy) is the building with the offices of the official representatives of  a country in another country. The official representatives include the main or most i mportant representative, called the “ambassador” (ambassador). Marjorie says, “That  sounds serious.” Andy says, “You bet it is,” meaning yes, that’s right. “ And that’s just the beginning. With economic sanctions there’ll be serious consequences  for business and trade.” “Trade” (trade) refers to selling and buying things  from another country or from a company in another country.

Andy says, “There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companie s doing business there, and there’ll be a naval blockade to enforce it.” An  “embargo” (embargo) is when companies are not allowed to buy and sell things fr om another country. All companies are forbidden to sell or buy things from any company in this other country. We would call that a “trade embargo.” Ther e is also something called an “arms (arms) embargo.” That would be when you preve nt or try to prevent anyone from selling weapons to another country.

This embargo, according to Andy, will be enforced b y a “naval blockade.” “To enforce” (enforce) is to make sure that people foll ow, or obey, the law or the rule that you have established. “Naval” (naval) refers to ships on the ocean or, specifically, to the military ships of a country. A  “blockade” (blockade) is when you prevent anything from leaving or coming into a certain area – in this case, a certain country. It would be very unusual for any c ountry to have a naval

blockade to enforce a trade embargo. That might hap pen for an arms embargo, but usually not for a trade embargo. But McQuillanl and apparently is a very serious violator of international law, and so this is considered necessary.

Marjorie says, “Wow, the McQuillanlanders” – people  who live in McQuillanland – “have really done it this time,” meaning they’ve do ne something really wrong. Andy says, “They have. What made them think they co uld thumb their noses at us and get away with it?” “To thumb (thumb) your no se at” someone is an interesting expression meaning to act disrespectful ly towards someone or to disobey a law – to not follow a law and not really care that you’re not following the law.

Andy says that the McQuillanlanders have thumbed th eir nose at us and they think they can get away with it. “To get away with”  something is to do something bad, but not to be punished. When you break a law b ut you’re not caught, that would be “to get away with it.” Marjorie says, “I h ave no idea,” meaning I don’t know how they thought they could get away with it, “but they are about to find out what the repercussions are when they flout national  law!”

“Repercussions” (repercussions) are negative conseq uences of something, bad things that happen as a result of something else. “ To flout” (flout) means to ignore a law or a rule – to break a rule even thoug h you know that you’re not supposed to. That’s “to flout the law” or “to flout  a rule.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: Well, it’s happened.

Marjorie: What’s happened?

Andy: The U.S. has placed diplomatic and economic s anctions on McQuillanland. It’s about time! The McQuillanland government has v iolated international law for the last time!

Marjorie: That’s great, but what does it really mea n?

Andy: Well, it means that all high-level talks betw een the U.S. and McQuillanland have been called off, and the U.S. embassy is closi ng.

Marjorie: That sounds serious.

 Andy: You bet it is, and that’s just the beginning.  With economic sanctions, there’ll be serious consequences for business and t rade. There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companies doing business there, and there’l l be a naval blockade to enforce it.

Marjorie: Wow, the McQuillanlanders have really don e it this time.

Andy: They have. What made them think they could th umb their noses at us and get away with it?

Marjorie: I have no idea, but they’re about to find  out what the repercussions are when they flout international law!

This episode is a dialogue between Victor and Julia  about buying things – not by going to a store, but by watching television and us ing your telephone. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: Turn off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.

Julia: I wasn’t going to do anything.

Victor: You’re watching the home shopping channel a nd you have the phone in your hand, which means you’re about to call them an d order something. Admit it.

Julia: I just wanted to ask some questions about th is amazing item that’s on- screen right now. It’s 30 percent off if I call wit hin the next eight minutes. Look how nice it looks on the model. It’s a limited edit ion necklace. If I don’t call soon, they’ll be sold out!

Victor: That’s why I have to keep you from calling.  You don’t need another piece of second-rate jewelry from the home shopping chann el.

Julia: Oh, look what you’ve done! They’re sold out.  But hey, look at that machine they’re demonstrating. It’s amazing what it can do.

Victor: You don’t need another ridiculous gadget th at you buy after watching some rigged demonstration. You know that they never  work the same way at home as they do on TV.

Julia: Some of them do. Remember that machine I bou ght for washing nuts? That worked well.

Victor: Yeah, and how much use did we get out of th at? We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resist. Tha t’s why I need to do something drastic.

Julia: What?

Victor: I’m confiscating that remote!

[end of dialogue]

Victor begins our dialogue by saying to Julia, “Tur n off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.” Victor tell s Julia to stop watching the television and to “put down that phone.” Julia is h olding the phone in her hand. Victor is telling her to put it down, to return it back to the table or the desk where it was sitting before. Victor says, “I know what yo u’re about to do” – I know what you are going to do. That’s what “about to” means h ere.

Julia says, “I wasn’t going to do anything.” Victor  says, “You’re watching the home shopping channel and you have the phone in you r hand, which means you’re about to call them and order something. Admi t it.” “Home shopping” is the practice of purchasing, or buying, things at home –  watching your television and using your telephone to call in and order whatever it is you are buying.

Nowadays in the United States, you can watch your t elevision and they have programs where they are selling things, all sorts of things – perfume, jewelry, clothing – almost anything you can think of that ca n be sold. They sell it on these “home shopping channels,” these home shopping progr ams. You watch the program and they give you a telephone number to cal l. You call a number, you say, “I want this,” and you give them your credit c ard information, and then they send it to you. That’s what Julia is “about to do.”  That is what she was getting ready to do, what she was going to do.

Victor says, “Admit it.” “Admit (admit) it” is a ph rase we use to force someone to agree with what we have just said, especially when the person doesn’t want to say that it’s true. But you know it’s true, and you ’re trying to get the person to say, “Yes, that is true.” So, for example, you migh t say, “You are afraid to ask Julie on a date, aren’t you? Admit it.” You could s ay that to your friend who is maybe scared of asking a woman out on a date: “Admi t it. You don’t want to ask her, because you’re scared.”

You could use “admit it” in lots of different circu mstances, but it always refers to a case where the person you are talking to doesn’t wa nt to tell the truth, or is

embarrassed or perhaps afraid to tell the truth. Ju lia is not admitting that she was about to call and order something, however. She say s, “I just wanted to ask some questions about this amazing item that’s on-sc reen right now.” “Amazing” means wonderful, great. An “item” (item) is just a thing that is being, in this case, sold. “On-screen” means on the television – showing  on the television right now.

Julia says this item that is on-screen right now – we don’t know what it is – is 30 percent off “if I call within the next eight minute s.” Home shopping channels motivate you to pick up the phone and buy by giving  you a deadline – by saying well, you can get a discount if you buy this item i n the next eight minutes or ten minutes or thirty minutes. That time pressure force s you to make a decision, and it is very effective in getting people to buy. “30 percent off” (off) means a 30 percent discount. That’s what you will get if you b uy this item within the next eight minutes.

Julia says, “Look how nice it looks on the model.” A “model” (model) is a person who is used to show how nice a piece of clothing lo oks, or perhaps a piece of jewelry looks. These home shopping channels are ver y popular with women who are buying clothing and jewelry, or at least it wou ld seem that way based on the kinds of shows that you see there. Julia then tells  us what she’s talking about – she’s talking about a “limited edition necklace.”

A “necklace” is something that you wear around your  neck. Women, especially, often wear necklaces. “Limited edition” means that there are only a small number of these items that have been made and that we are selling. Something that is “limited edition” is something that is not going to  be made in large numbers, in large quantities. Julia says, “If I don’t call soon , they’ll be sold out!” “Sold out” means there are no more left to buy. When an item is “sold out,” it is no longer available because the storesold all of the items th at it had.

Victor says, “That’s why I have to keep you from ca lling.” That’s why I have to prevent you from calling. “You don’t need another p iece of second-rate jewelry from the home shopping channel.” “Second-rate” (rat e) means inferior in quality – not a very good quality. To call something “second- rate” is to say it’s not very good. If you say something is “first-rate,” then yo u’re saying that it is high quality, it is very good quality. But this jewelry is not ve ry good quality, according to Victor.

Julia says, “Oh, look what you’ve done!” She uses t his expression as a way of blaming Victor for something that happened. He’s do ne something wrong. That’s why she says, “Look what you’ve done. They’re sold out” – there aren’t any more available to buy. Then she says, “But hey, look at that machine they’re

demonstrating” (they’re showing you how to use). “I t’s amazing what it can do.” Victor says, “You don’t need another ridiculous gad get that you buy after watching some rigged demonstration.”

A “gadget” (gadget) is a small device, a small tool  or machine that usually has one limited use. I remember it used to be very popu lar for people to buy a little machine that you would use to make hamburgers. That ’s all really it did. It made hamburgers. It was like a hot plate. It was like tw o hot pieces of metal that you put on either side of the beef and you would use it  to make a hamburger. These were very popular 20, 30 years ago.

Also very popular were special machines that made p opcorn. When I was growing up, in the ‘70s and ‘80s, everybody had the se machines that only made popcorn. That’s really all you could do with it. Of  course, you could make popcorn in other ways with a regular pan, but these machine s were very popular because, I guess, everyone needed to eat popcorn in the ‘70’ s. I don’t know.

Well, these home shopping networks, these home shop ping channels, sell a lot of these machines – these small tools or gadgets th at make things that aren’t always the most useful. Victor doesn’t want Julia to buy one of these. He says that the demonstration that she is watching on tele vision is rigged. When something is “rigged” (rigged), it has somehow been  made to look better than it is. It’s not authentic. It’s not real.

If A contest has been rigged, the results of the co ntest cannot be trusted because someone has done something to make it unfair, to ma ke it so that it’s not a real contest. If you pay a boxer a million dollars to lo se his next fight, that would be rigging the competition. That would be rigging the contest so that it’s not a real contest. That’s what Victor is saying is happening with these demonstrations on television – they’re not real. They’re not legitima te demonstrations.

Victor says, “You know that they never work the sam e way at home as they do on TV.” He’s saying these gadgets never work as wel l when you get them in your own house as they do when you are watching them on television. Julia says, “Some of them do.” She disagrees with Victor. “Reme mber that machine I bought for washing nuts? That worked well.” Julie apparent ly bought a machine that did nothing but washed nuts, a kind of food. Julia says  that machine worked well.

Victor says, “Yeah,” meaning yes, “and how much use  did we get out of that?” meaning how much did we actually use it? Victor goe s on and says, “We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resi st. That’s why I need to do something drastic.” A “steal” (steal) here means a bargain, something that you

bought for a very low price. “To resist” means to a void doing something, to stop yourself from doing something. “Drastic” (drastic) is extreme or severe.

Victor says that Julia cannot “resist,” cannot stop  herself from buying things she thinks are “steals,” or good deals. That’s why he h as to do something extreme, something that he wouldn’t normally have to do in o rder to stop Julia from buying more things. Julia says, “What?” Victor says, “I’m confiscating that remote!” “To confiscate” (confiscate) means to take something aw ay so that another person can no longer use it or have it. It’s a verb normal ly used when we’re talking about the police taking illegal drugs from someone, or pe rhaps the teacher taking something away from a student that the student shou ldn’t have.

Victor is going to confiscate the “remote” (remote) . The “remote” is the remote control. It’s that small device that you use to cha nge the channels on your television or to turn the volume up and down. Many years ago, of course, we didn’t have remote controls. You actually had to ge t out of your chair and walk over to the television and turn the channel or turn  the volume up or down. Oh, the good old days.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: Turn off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.

Julia: I wasn’t going to do anything.

Victor: You’re watching the home shopping channel a nd you have the phone in your hand, which means you’re about to call them an d order something. Admit it.

Julia: I just wanted to ask some questions about th is amazing item that’s on- screen right now. It’s 30 percent off if I call wit hin the next eight minutes. Look how nice it looks on the model. It’s a limited edit ion necklace. If I don’t call soon, they’ll be sold out!

Julia: Oh, look what you’ve done! They’re sold out.  But hey, look at that machine they’re demonstrating. It’s amazing what it can do.

 Victor: You don’t need another ridiculous gadget th at you buy after watching some rigged demonstration. You know that they never  work the same way at home as they do on TV.

Julia: Some of them do. Remember that machine I bou ght for washing nuts? That worked well.

Victor: Yeah, and how much use did we get out of th at? We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resist. Tha t’s why I need to do something drastic.

# Breaking Bad Habits

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 983 – Breaking Bad Habits.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 983. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Our website is E SLPod.com. Go there. Become a member of ESL Podcast and download a Learn ing Guide for this episode. You can also like us on Facebook at facebo ok.com/eslpod.

This dialogue is about breaking bad habits – trying  to stop doing things that you have been doing probably for a long time, but that are bad for you. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Counselor: Welcome, everybody. You’ve all joined th is support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to break. Would anyone like to introduce themselves and tell us about their bad ha bit?

Stu: Uh yeah, I’m Stu and my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really bad habits. One of my w orst is my nail biting. You can see that they’re pretty ragged.

Counselor: Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone else . .  .?

Stu: Oh yeah, I also smack my gum. That drives my w ife crazy, so I try not to do it in her presence.

Counselor: Well, thanks for sharing, Stu. If we cou ld move on to . . .

Stu: I also tend to tap my fingers and crack my joi nts, which my wife says is really annoying, though her hair twirling is pretty annoyi ng to me.

Counselor: Stu? Let’s let a few other people . . .

Stu: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention what my wife says  is my most annoying bad habit.

Counselor: What is that?

Stu: I tend to interrupt people in conversation.

Counselor: Really? I hadn’t noticed.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the counselor – the person  who is providing advice and guidance to people – welcoming everyone to this gro up. We’re in some sort of group counseling session, and so the leader of the group is called the “counselor” (counselor). Someone who is called a “c ounselor” in a situation like this typically will have some training in how to he lp people, but not quite as much as a regular psychologist or psychiatrist.

The counselor says, “Welcome everybody. You’ve all joined this support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to  break.” A “support group” is a group of people who have similar problems or chal lenges and who want help from other people in similar situations. Sometimes talking to other people who have the same problem or issue that you have can he lp you.

“Bad habits” are things that you do over and over a gain, often without thinking about it very much, that have negative consequences  for you, that are bad for you. Some people might say smoking cigarettes is a bad habit. It’s a difficult habit to break, however. “To break (break) a habit” means  to stop doing the habit – to no longer do it. Of course, you can also have “good  habits,” things that you do every day or frequently that are good for you. Brus hing your teeth and taking a shower, those are good habits – things that are goo d for you.

The whole idea of good habits and bad habits goes b ack at least to the time of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who wrote a book c alled The Ethics , about the formation of good and bad habits – “moral habits” a nd “intellectual habits,” as he called them – but we’re not going to talk about Ari stotle today. We’re going to talk about the support group that is helping people brea k bad habits.

The counselor says, “Would anyone like to introduce  themselves and tell us about their bad habit?” Would anyone like to tell u s their name and tell us what their bad habit is? Stu says, “Uh yeah, I’m Stu and  my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really b ad habits.” Poor Stu. Stu doesn’t think, apparently, he has bad habits, but h is wife thinks that he has some bad habits. So, his loving wife “signed him up” for  this support group. “To sign someone up” is a phrasal verb meaning to put someon e’s name on a list saying that they will participate in a certain activity. A nother verb we could use here is “to enroll” (enroll).

 Stu’s wife has signed him up for this support group  because his wife thinks that he has “some really bad habits.” Of course, all wiv es think that their husbands have really bad habits. That’s part of being a wife . I’m just kidding, of course, honey. Stu says, “One of my worst” – meaning one of  my worst habits – “is nail biting.” Your “nail” (nail) is a part of your hand.  At the end of each finger, you have “nails” (nails). “To bite” (bite) means to use  your teeth to eat or to break something.

In this case, Stu is biting his nails, which some p eople believe is a bad habit. People bite their fingernails, in particular. I gue ss you could bite your toenails also, but that would be very difficult for most peo ple. Stu says, “You can see” – he’s showing the group his fingernails – “that they ’re pretty ragged.” “To be ragged” (ragged) means to be uneven, to be not smoo th. He’s showing the group his fingernails and indicating that yes, he does in  fact bite his nails. The counselor says, “Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone el se?” But Stu isn’t finished talking. Stu says, “Oh yeah, I also smack my gum. T hat drives my wife crazy, so I try not to do it in her presence.”

“Gum” (gum) refers to bubblegum or chewing gum, som ething you put in your mouth, that is usually flavored, and you chew it – you bite down on it, up and down with your teeth – to get the flavor out of the  gum. “To smack (smack) your gum” means to make loud noises or sounds while you are chewing your gum. I don’t have any gum in my mouth right now, so I can’ t demonstrate. Stu says that this smacking of his gum drives his wife crazy, mea ning it makes his wife angry or upset. He tries not to smack his gum “in her pre sence,” meaning when his wife is there with him.

The counselor says, “Well, thanks for sharing, Stu. ” “To share” (share) means to talk about something with other people, especially to talk about your experiences or your opinions about something. We sometimes use that verb sarcastically when someone is telling us something that we don’t really want to know, perhaps because it’s too personal. We might say to that per son, “Thanks for sharing,” meaning I didn’t really want you to tell me that. I t’s kind of an insulting thing to say.

Stu isn’t being insulted by the counselor. The coun selor simply wants someone else to talk. That’s why she says, “If we could mov e on to . . .” “To move on to” something or someone means to go to someone else – in this case, to have someone else talk about their bad habits, not Stu. But Stu isn’t finished. He says, “I also tend to tap my fingers and crack my joints,  which my wife says is really

annoying. “To tend (tend) to” do something is to of ten do something, especially when you’re not thinking about it.

Stu tends “to tap” (tap) his fingers. “To tap your fingers” is to hit one or more of your fingers against a table or something else, usu ally several times, over and over again, making a small noise. People sometimes tap their fingers at a meeting when they’re bored, which is to say at almo st every meeting. This is considered by some to be a bad habit.

Stu also cracks his joints. “To crack (crack) your joints (joints)” is to move or bend a part of your body that connects two bones. Usuall y we talk about cracking our “knuckles” (knuckles). Your knuckles are the parts of your hand that connect the fingers to the main part of your hand. “To crack yo ur knuckles” – I’m not sure if I can do this anymore – is to bend your hands in such  a way that they make a sound. Cracking your knuckles, or cracking your joi nts, is to move your bones in such a way that they make a noise – like that.

Stu’s wife finds this very annoying. Something that  is “annoying” (annoying) is something that is irritating, something that bother s you, Stu says that his wife’s hair twirling is pretty annoying to him, as well. “ To twirl (twirl) your hair” is to take a small section of your hair and move it around in circles with your finger, especially when you’re bored or distracted. It’s so mething that you usually will see with girls and women, because they typically ha ve longer hair.

I remember when I was teaching high school many yea rs ago. (Yes, I taught high school many years ago. It’s kind of scary.) The you ng girls in my classes would often twirl their hair because they were bored by m y lectures, by my presentations, which I can understand. Stu’s wife t wirls her hair, and that is annoying to Stu. The counselor says, “Stu, let’s le t a few other people . . .” She’s about to say, “Let’s let a few other people talk,” but Stu doesn’t wait long enough for her to finish her sentence.

Stu continues talking. He says, “Oh yeah, I forgot to mention what my wife says is my most annoying habit.” The counselor says, “What is that?” Stu says, “I tend to interrupt people in conversation.” “To interrupt ” (interrupt) is to speak when someone else is still speaking, before they have ha d a chance to finish what they want to say. That, of course, is exactly what Stu is doing here with the counselor.

The counselor then makes a joke at the end. She say s, “Really? I hadn’t noticed,” meaning I didn’t even realize that you ha ve this bad habit of interrupting. Of course, she did, and that’s why sh e’s saying this in a sarcastic way, in a joking way.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Counselor: Welcome, everybody. You’ve all joined th is support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to break. Would anyone like to introduce themselves and tell us about their bad ha bit?

Stu: Uh yeah, I’m Stu and my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really bad habits. One of my w orst is my nail biting. You can see that they’re pretty ragged.

Counselor: Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone else . .  .?

# Competing in Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 984 – Competing in Business.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 984. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, where we have some additional courses in Business a nd Daily English.

This episode is a dialogue between Yoko and Cedric about competition – trying to be the best company, the most successful company , in your area. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yoko: We used to be the only game in town. Now we h ave three competitors and they are luring away our customers.

Cedric: I know. We need to do something before we g o under. What about price matching?

Yoko: Our prices are already competitive. If we wan t to focus on price, we’ll need to undercut our competitors.

Cedric: Slashing prices would be really hard on our  profit margin, but these are desperate times. What do you think of a two-for-one  deal? We could offer it for a limited time.

Yoko: We can do that if lowering our prices doesn’t  work. I’m thinking we could go in another direction. What do you think about of fering freebies or gifts with purchase?

Cedric: I think that’s a good idea. The more frills  we include, the better our services look. What kind of frills?

Yoko: I’m not sure, but the more bells and whistles  the better.

Cedric: And if all of this doesn’t work?

Yoko: Then we’ll be up the creek without a paddle!

[end of dialogue]

Yoko begins by saying to Cedric, “We used to be the  only game in town.” The expression “the only game (game) in town” means the  only person or only organization involved in this particular business o r in this particular field. “To be the only game in town” is not to have any competiti on. You’re the only company that is doing what you are doing. Yoko says that is  no longer true for her company.

She says, “Now we have three competitors and they a re luring away our customers.” A “competitor” (competitor) is someone who competes with you. “To compete” is to try to beat someone at something, to  be better than someone else. A competitor is a person or a company that do es what you do, and tries to do it better than you do. So, if you’re buying a ca r in the United States, you could buy a Ford or a Chevy or a Toyota or a Mazda – all of those companies are competitors. They’re all trying to do the same thin g, which is to sell cars.

Yoko says that her competitors are “luring away” cu stomers. “To lure (lure) away” is a phrasal verb meaning to attract someone away f rom another person or another business. You can lure someone away by offe ring them something better, or perhaps the same thing but cheaper. Cedr ic says, “I know. We need to do something before we go under.” “To go under” is a phrasal verb meaning to go out of business - “to go broke,” we could also s ay – to no longer have the money to continue. It is especially used when talki ng about a business.

Cedric says, “What about price matching? Cedric is proposing that their company lower their price, or offer the same price for the product or service they’re selling as their competitors have. That’s what “price match ing” is. Yoko says, “Our prices are already competitive.” “To be competitive” is to  have similar qualities or characteristics of other companies or other options . When someone says, “We are competitive,” he means they have the same price s or similar prices, in this case, as other companies.

Yoko is saying that that isn’t really a good soluti on because their prices are already pretty competitive, pretty similar to the o ther companies. Yoko says, “If we want to focus on price, we’ll need to undercut o ur competitors.” “To undercut” (undercut) is to sell something at a lower price. S o, if you undercut your competitors, you sell what you are selling at a low er or much lower price.

Cedric says, “Slashing prices would be really hard on our profit margin, but these are desperate times.” “To slash (slash) prices” is to lower or reduce or cut prices. “Profit” (profit) is how much your company makes. I t’s the difference between the money you take in and the money you have to pay out  for your expenses. Your “profit margin” (margin) is basically the amount of  money, sometimes expressed as a percentage of money, that you make in your bus iness.

So, if you have a ten percent profit margin, you are making or bringing in ten percent more than you are paying out. You are takin g more money from your customers than you are spending to make your produc t and run your business. If you slash your prices, you may reduce or lower your  profit margin. That’s what Cedric means when he says that “slashing prices wou ld be really hard on our profit margin,” meaning it would lower our profit m argin.

However, Cedric also says, “These are desperate tim es.” “Desperate times” refers to a situation where things are going badly quickly, and you need to do something quickly in order to save the situation – in this case, in order to prevent your company from going under. Desperate times are difficult times, challenging times.

Cedric says, “What do you think of a two-for-one de al?” “Two-for-one” means you get two of something for the normal price of one of  something. So, if you are buying some pumpkin pies – and by the way, that’s m y favorite kind of pie, in case you are looking for something to buy me for my  birthday – you may be able to find some stores selling the pumpkin pies at a “ two-for-one deal,” or a two-for- one price. That means you would get two pies for the price that you would normally pay for one. That’s what Cedric is proposi ng here, is suggesting here.

He says, “We could offer it for a limited time.” “F or a limited time” means only temporarily, not forever. It’s a very good strategy , when selling, to put some sort of time limit on the price that you are selling som ething for. It motivates people. It gives people a reason to buy right now. If you don’ t don’t give people a reason to buy right now, they’ll say, “Oh, well maybe I’ll bu y it in the future,” and then they never actually buy it. That’s one of the things tha t good marketing does, is to motivate the buyer to buy the product. That’s part of what Cedric is saying here. He’s thinking of offering this two-for-one deal for  a limited time.

Yoko says, “We can do that if lowering our prices d oesn’t work.” Yoko wants to start by lowering the price, and then if that doesn ’t help, they can try this two-for- one deal. Yoko says, “I’m thinking we could go in a nother direction,” meaning we could do something different. “What do you think ab out offering freebies or gifts

with purchase?” A “freebie” (freebie) is, you may a lready have guessed, something you get for free. Some stores give away s amples of their products.

If you go to the grocery store in the United States , sometimes the store will give you a cracker or a piece of cheese. That’s a freebi e. You don’t have to pay anything for it. Of course, they’re doing that to g et you to try the product so that eventually you will buy some. “Gift with purchase” is when you get something extra when you buy a certain product. So, a woman w ho goes to a store to buy some makeup – things to make her face look beautifu l – the store may offer her a gift with purchase. If she buys this 50 dollar pack age of makeup, they will give her a two-dollar lipstick. Or ten-dollar lipstick. I don’t know how much lipsticks cost. I don’t buy lipstick. Not anymore.

Technically, a “gift” is something that someone giv es you without you having to pay for it or give anything in return. So, “gift wi th purchase” doesn’t really make a lot of sense, because you are actually having to bu y something. It’s really just another way of lowering the price of the thing you are buying. There’s also a very popular expression in advertising in English: “free  gift.” Once again, gifts are free by definition. If you had to pay for the gift, it w ouldn’t be a gift. But that’s just something that advertisers do to emphasize that it is free.

Cedric says, “I think that’s a good idea. The more frills we include, the better our services look.” A “frill” (frill) is something addi tional that’s nice to have, but isn’t necessary. If you stay in a hotel, it’s necessary f or you to have a bed and a room and a bathroom. It’s not necessary for you to have a spa or a swimming pool or a restaurant or a lot of other things that many hotel s have. Those extra things are called “frills.” That’s what Cedric is referring to .

Yoko says, “I’m not sure” after Cedric asks, “What kind of frills?” Yoko says, “The more bells and whistles the better.” “The more” her e means the more that we have. The phrase “bells and whistles” is an old one  to refer to the same basic idea as frill – additional items that make somethin g more interesting or more exciting, but aren’t really necessary.

We often use this term when talking nowadays about technology. You can buy a phone that makes a phone call, or you could buy a p hone that makes a phone call and Sends email and allows you to check the In ternet, and so forth. Those extra things would be “bells and whistles.” They’re  not, strictly speaking, necessary for a phone, but people like to buy phone s that have those bells and whistles, those additional features.

Cedric says, “And if all of this doesn’t work?” mea ning what happens if we try all of these things and we still don’t make money. Yoko  answers, “Then it we’ll be up the creek without a paddle!” “To be up a creek (cre ek) without a paddle (paddle)” means to be in a very difficult situation, a situat ion that is going to be very difficult to get out of. A “creek” is a small river. A “paddl e” is something you use to move a boat in the water just with your arms and hands. You use a paddle with small boats, typically. The whole expression taken togeth er, however, means to be in a difficult or challenging situation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yoko: We used to be the only game in town. Now we h ave three competitors and they are luring away our customers.

Cedric: I know. We need to do something before we g o under. What about price matching?

Yoko: Our prices are already competitive. If we wan t to focus on price, we’ll need to undercut our competitors.

Cedric: Slashing prices would be really hard on our  profit margin, but these are desperate times. What do you think of a two-for-one  deal? We could offer it for a limited time.

Yoko: We can do that if lowering our prices doesn’t  work. I’m thinking we could go in another direction. What do you think about of fering freebies or gifts with purchase?

Cedric: I think that’s a good idea. The more frills  we include, the better our services look. What kind of frills?

Yoko: I’m not sure, but the more bells and whistles  the better.

Cedric: And if all of this doesn’t work?

Yoko: Then we’ll be up the creek without a paddle!

# School Fundraisers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 985 – School Fundraisers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 985. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store with some additional courses in English. You can also re ad our ESL Podcast Blog, and why not go over to Facebook and like us at face book.com/eslpod.

This dialogue is about trying to raise money – trying to get money – for some activity at your school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Valerie: What’s this?

A.J.: It’s a note from Rachel’s school. It’s about the next fundraiser.

Valerie: Oh no, not another one. What is it this ti me – a raffle, car wash, or spaghetti dinner?

A.J.: It’s none of those things. It’s a combination  bake sale and craft sale. Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and hand made items.

Valerie: This is crazy. Every month there’s somethi ng else. Last month, it was a candy sale. I had to hit up everybody at work, and that’s on the tail of raffle tickets the month before. It’s like this every year .

A.J.: I know. We already donated a lot of things to  the rummage sale last semester and gift certificates for the silent aucti on two months ago. With two kids in two different schools, I feel like we never get a breather.

Valerie: I know, and there’s more. Brian’s school is asking parents to buy a brick that will be part of a new school building and our names will be engraved on it.

A.J.: You’re kidding, right? One more fundraiser an d my name will get engraved, all right – on my tombstone!

[end of dialogue]

Valerie begins our dialogue by saying to A.J., “Wha t’s this?” A.J. says, “It’s a note from Rachel’s school.” A “note” here means a piece of paper with information on it. Schools often send information back to parents,  or at least they used to, by giving the students pieces of paper that the studen ts would then deliver to the parents. Nowadays, I guess they could just email the information. A.J. says this note is “about the next fund raiser.” A “fundraiser ” (fundraiser) is an event organized by some organization to make money.

One of the things that surprises people about Ameri can schools when they come here is that even though our public schools are fre e, the schools often have activities, events, in order to make more money for  special programs for the students of the school. For example, if you have a football team or musical group that you want your students to participate in, the government may not give the school enough money for the school to organize that . So, the parents have fundraisers where they try to get money by doing a variety of different things.

Valerie talks about some of those things in her rep ly to A.J. She says, “Oh no, not another one,” meaning not another fund raiser. “What is it this time – a raffle, carwash, or spaghetti dinner?” Valerie lists three popular ways that schools and other organizations try to get money. A “raffle” (r affle) is basically a lottery. It’s an arrangement where people by tickets with the chance  of winning one or more prizes, such as money or an iPod or sometimes even a car. That’s a “raffle.”

A “car wash” is an event where a group of people, u sually students or young adults, get together and they wash people’s cars in  order to get money for their group. We used to do this when I was growing up. the school I went to would sometimes have car washes, where the students would  go and wash people’s cars for five dollars or seven dollars – I don’t re member how much – and they would give that money then to the group so that the  group would have money to do whatever it is they wanted to do.

“Spaghetti dinners” were also very popular when I w as growing up. Spaghetti dinners are when usually a group of students prepar es food for people to eat, and then people pay, of course, to get the spaghett i dinner. Spaghetti was popular because it was easy and somewhat inexpensiv e to make. A.J. says this fundraiser is not a raffle, not a car wash, or a sp aghetti dinner. He says, “It’s none of those things.” He says, “It’s a combination  bake sale and craft sale.” These are two other popular fundraisers that are us ed by schools. A “bake sale” is when different people bake cakes and cookies and  other sweets, and sell them.

 A “craft (craft) sale” is where people make things – not things you eat, but things like ornaments or decorations for your house. Peopl e make these things, and then the group sells them and keeps the money, of c ourse, from the sale. “Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and han dmade items,” according to A.J. “To donate” (donate) means to give to a per son or group without expecting anything back. When you donate money or d onate things to a group, you give them to the person or the group. A.J. is s aying that the parents are supposed to donate things for the bake sale and for  the craft sale.

Valerie says, “This is crazy,” meaning she doesn’t like this idea. “Every month there’s something else. Last month it was a candy s ale.” A “candy sale” is when a school or organization buys candy from a company and then sells that candy at a higher price. It of course keeps the difference b etween the money it spent to buy the candy and the money it got selling the cand y. Once again, this is something we did at our school when I was going to high school and grade school. We had candy sales every year where we had to go out and sell these chocolate candies by going around and asking people  to buy them.

Valerie says that she “had to hit up everybody at w ork.” “To hit up” is a phrasal verb which here means to ask someone for money – in  this case, to ask someone to buy the candy bars. Parents often help their children sell this candy by asking their friends at work to buy the candy. I ’ve done that many times in the places where I’ve worked.

Valerie says that these sales are “on the tail of r affle tickets the month before.” Something that is “on the tail (tail) of” something  means it comes immediately after that. Dogs and other animals have tails – lit tle parts of their bodies that go off the end of their body, the back of their body. That’s what “tail” means. It means the end of something. Valerie says, “It’s lik e this every year,” meaning every year they have all of these different fundrai sers.

A.J. says, “I know. We already donated a lot of thi ngs to the rummage sale last semester.” A “rummage (rummage) sale” is similar to  a “garage sale” or a “yard sale,” but is typically held by a group, usually in  a large auditorium or in a large area outside of, in this case, the school. A rummag e sale is when people donate things they no longer want any more, and the organi zation takes those things and sells them to other people. Usually it takes pl ace on one day, or over a two- day period. Many schools and other religious organi zations have rummage sales in order to make money for their group.

A.J. also says that he and Valerie donated gift cer tificates for the silent auction two months ago. A “gift certificate” is usually a p iece of paper you buy that allows you to spend a certain amount of money at a store. Nowadays, it’s much more common to have gift cards, which are like little cr edit cards but are used only for one particular store and have a certain amount of m oney on them. A “silent auction” (auction) is an event where people write their name on a list to show how much money they’re willing to pay for something .

An “auction” is normally when things are sold to the person that will give the highest price. There isn’t one set, or fixed, price . A “silent auction” is the same concept, except you don’t have somebody standing up  and trying to sell it in front of a group of people; rather, you have a list next to each thing that’s being sold, and you go around and you put down the price you’re  willing to pay. We would call that price, in an auction, your “bid” (bid).

A.J. says, “With two kids in two different schools,  I feel like we never get a breather.” A.J. and Valerie have two children, and they are attending, or going to, two different schools. Each school will have its ow n fundraisers. That means a lot of fundraisers for A.J. and Valerie. That’s what A. J. is talking about when he says, “I feel like we never get a breather” (breath er). A “breather” is a time to breathe, literally, but it means here a break, a pe riod of time when you can rest.

Valerie says, “I know, and there’s more. Brian’s sc hool is asking parents to buy a brick that will be part of a new school building an d our names will be engraved on it.” When an organization is building a new buildin g, they’ll often try to raise money for that building by selling bricks, and thes e are bricks that will go into the wall, that will have the person who gave the money’ s name on it. The name will be “engraved” (engraved) on the brick.

“To engrave” means to use a special tool that puts writing on typically a piece of metal, although we also use that verb when talking about putting words in stone or on a very hard surface like a brick. I actually used to work, when I was in high school and in college, at a place that did engravin g, so I would put people’s names on cups – on silver cups or on other signs th at they would put on their door, for example. That’s “engraving.”

Schools and other organizations try to raise money for new buildings by selling bricks for 500 dollars or a thousand dollars. You c an’t just bring a brick and give it to the school and say, “Well, here’s my brick.” You ’re not buying the brick, of course. You’re just donating money, and this is a w ay of recognizing your donation. A.J. says, “You’re kidding, right?” meani ng you’re joking, aren’t you? But, of course, Valerie is not joking.

 “One more fundraiser and my name will get engraved,  all right – on my tombstone!” Your “tombstone” (tombstone) is a large  stone that is placed above where you are buried when you die. We call that pla ce where they put your body a “grave” (grave). Traditionally, tombstones on gra ves have the person’s name, the year they were born and the year they died, som etimes the actual date of their birth and death, and possibly a short message .

A.J. is joking, of course. He’s saying that there a re so many fundraisers that they are going to kill him with all this extra work. Tha t’s why he says, “One more fundraiser” – meaning if I have to participate in o ne more fundraiser – “and my name will get engraved, all right – on my tombstone !” “All right” here means for sure, or definitely.

Of course, that could be another fundraiser. School s could sell tombstones, and you could have your name engraved on it and just le ave the date of your death blank. You wouldn’t fill that in until you actually  died. I’m just kidding, of course.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Valerie: What’s this?

A.J.: It’s a note from Rachel’s school. It’s about the next fundraiser.

Valerie: Oh no, not another one. What is it this ti me – a raffle, car wash, or spaghetti dinner?

A.J.: It’s none of those things. It’s a combination  bake sale and craft sale. Parents are supposed to donate baked goods and hand made items.

“The Greatest Scriptwriter on the Internet” – that’ s what I think they should put on Lucy Tse’s tombstone one day (one day very, very fa r away, of course).



# Buying and Selling Family Heirlooms

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 986 – Buying and Selling Family Heirlooms.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 986. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there. Become a membe r of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is about buying and selling things that belong to your family that are usually old and valuable. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anne: Where are you going with that?

Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. R ather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.

Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grand father. It’s a family heirloom.

Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock  that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one gener ation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.

Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental v alue. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf . If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck .

Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but wha t if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money th at it would fetch to good use.

Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proce eds to good use?

Ivan: Sure, of course I am.

Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending  it on?

Ivan: Not on your life!

 [end of dialogue]

Anne begins this dialogue by saying to Ivan, “Where  are you going with that?” Ivan says, “I’m taking this clock to an antique dea ler.” “Antique” (antique) refers to something that is very old. An “antique dealer” (dealer) is someone who buys old things such as jewelry, pieces of furniture, ar twork, or other things that are old and perhaps valuable. An antique dealer, of course,  tries to buy things at a low price and then sell them at a high price just like any good businessperson. “Antiques” with an “s” at the end is used to descri be these items – the things that you would bring to an antique dealer.

Ivan says, “Rather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.” Ivan has taken a c lock to an antique dealer in order to “get it appraised,” he says, “rather than having it gather dust.” “To gather dust” (dust) means to sit unused for a long time. “ Dust” refers to the little pieces of dirt that accumulate, that collect, on top somet hing if you don’t move it for a very long time. That’s why every week or two, you m ay need to dust your house. You may need to go around and clean the little bits  of dirt off of your tables and other things that would collect dirt.

If something has a lot of dust on it, it hasn’t bee n moved or used in a long time, and that’s the real meaning of this expression, alt hough in the case of an old clock, it might have literally – actually – been ga thering dust. A “mantelpiece” (mantelpiece) is a shelf, a place to put something above a fireplace usually in the living room, or sometimes it might be called the “f amily room,” of a house. A mantelpiece is a place where you might put old phot ographs and an old clock.

Ivan says he wants to get this clock “appraised.” “ To appraise” (appraise) means to assess or to give a value to something – to give  an opinion about how much something is worth. You could have your house appra ised. If you were trying to get a loan, someone would come and tell you how muc h your house is worth. When you go to an antique dealer to get something a ppraised, you’re asking the antique dealer how much money you could get if you sold that item. Anne does not like this idea at all. She says, “You can’t sel l that. It belonged to our grandfather” – our grandfather owned it. “It’s a fa mily heirloom.”

A “family heirloom” (heirloom) is something that be longs to your family that has been passed on, or given, from one generation to an other. Usually, it’s something that’s considered valuable. So, for examp le, if your grandfather had an expensive ring, or your grandmother had some nic e jewelry, that might be considered a family heirloom. Your grandmother gave  it to your mother, and your

mother gives it to you, and you give it to your dau ghter, and so forth. Those are family heirlooms, valuable things, but sometimes are valuable not because they’re worth a lot of money; sometimes they’re val uable for what we might call “sentimental reasons,” and we’ll explain that in a second.

Ivan says, “It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a  clock that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from  one generation to another.” Ivan says “Grandpa didn’t mean for it” – meaning he  wasn’t intending, he wasn’t planning for it – “to be passed down.” “To be passe d down” means to give one object, usually something that is old to someone yo unger than you are – to the next generation. For example, when I die, my microp hone that I use for podcasting will be passed down to one of my nieces and nephews. It’s going to become a family heirloom, I’m sure.

“Generation” refers to a group of people who are bo rn at approximately the same time. In a family, a generation would be all of the  brothers and sisters in a family. Your father and mother are another generation, and your grandparents are another generation, and your nieces and nephews are  a younger generation. You have younger generations and older generations.  Ivan says this clock was not meant “to be passed down from one generation to  another.” He says, “I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable.” “To be collectable” (collectable) is to be something that people want to own. Things that are collectible are usually things that are worth some money, that have some value.

Ivan says, “These clocks could be a dime a dozen.” That expression, “a dime (dime) a dozen,” refers to something that is very c ommon, very popular, and therefore not worth a lot of money. A “dime” is 10 cents in American currency. A “dozen” is 12 of something. So, if you can buy 12 of something for a dime, it’s probably not a very valuable item. We usually use t his expression to refer to things that are not rare – of which many have been made.

Anne objects. She says, “But it’s valuable to me. I t has sentimental value.” “Sentimental (sentimental) value” refers to your em otional attachment to some object. It might not be worth anything to anyone el se. It might not be very valuable in itself, but it’s something that means s omething to you. So, the first love letter that your husband wrote you or the firs t rose that you gave your wife – these would be things that might have sentimental v alue. No one else is going to buy an old rose or a piece of paper that has a love  letter on it. These are things that are valuable to you. They have sentimental val ue.

Anne continues, “As a little girl, I remember visit ing Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf. If I had inherited it, I know I  wouldn’t be looking to sell it to

make a quick buck.” “To inherit” (inherit) is to re ceive money or objects from someone who has died. You can inherit something fro m your parents. For example, they may give you things or give you money  when they die. “To make a quick buck” (buck) means to try to make money quick ly and easily. A “buck” is a dollar. It’s an informal term for one American doll ar. “To make a quick buck” is an old expression meaning to try to make money quickly  and easily.

Ivan says, “I’m not looking” – I’m not trying – “to  make a quick buck. But what if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be ab le to put the money that it would fetch to good use.” “To fetch” (fetch) here m eans to bring money or to bring something to you. When we talk about what pri ce this will fetch, we mean how much money will we get, what price it will be. What Ivan is saying here is that Grandpa may have left this clock to him becaus e Grandpa knew that Ivan would put the money that he would get from it – the  money he would fetch – to good use. “To good use” here means for a good purpo se.

Anne says, “Well, are you? Are you going to put the  proceeds to good use?” “Proceeds” (proceeds) is money that you get from se lling something. There’s always an “s” on the end if it’s used as a noun in this way: “proceeds.” Ivan says, “Sure. Of course I am” – of course I’m going to put  it to good use. Anne says, “Are you going to tell me what you’re spending it o n?” Anne wants to know what Ivan is going to do with the money he gets from sel ling the old clock.

Ivan, however, refuses to tell her. He says, “Not o n your life!” That expression, “not on your life,” means no way. It’s a phrase use d to show that you are not going to do that, no matter what happens. Of course , we suspect that perhaps Ivan is not going to put the money to good use, but  is going to go gambling, or perhaps go drinking with his friends, or something that we would not normally consider to be a good use.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anne: Where are you going with that?

Ivan: I’m taking this clock to an antique dealer. R ather than having it gather dust on the mantelpiece, I thought I’d get it appraised and maybe sell it.

Anne: You can’t sell that! It belonged to our grand father. It’s a family heirloom.

Ivan: It’s not a family heirloom. It’s just a clock  that Grandpa had in his house. He didn’t mean for it to be passed down from one gener ation to another. I don’t even know if it’s valuable or collectable. These clocks could be a dime a dozen.

Anne: But it’s valuable to me. It has sentimental v alue. As a little girl, I remember visiting Grandpa and seeing that clock on his shelf . If I had inherited it, I know I wouldn’t be looking to sell it to make a quick buck .

Ivan: I’m not looking to make a quick buck, but wha t if Grandpa left it to me because he knew I would be able to put the money th at it would fetch to good use.

Anne: Well, are you? Are you going to put the proce eds to good use?

Ivan: Sure, of course I am.

Anne: Are you going to tell me what you’re spending  it on?

Ivan: Not on your life!

# Taking Prescription Drugs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 987 – Taking Prescription Drugs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 987. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The website for this wonderful podcast is ESLPod.co m. Become a member of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Paula and Marcus  about taking drugs – medicine that the doctor has given you to take. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Okay, I’m off to bed.

Marcus: Wait a second. Where are you going with all  of those pill bottles?

Paula: My doctor prescribed a couple of medications  to help me sleep.

Marcus: Let me see those. You have four different m edications here. This is a painkiller, this is a sedative, this is a tranquili zer, and this is a stimulant.

Paula: I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.

Marcus: You mean you take the first three every nig ht?

Paula: Not every night.

Marcus: I can’t believe that your doctor would pres cribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep. This seems like  overkill.

Paula: I saw more than one doctor. They each gave m e a different prescription.

Marcus: How do you know they won’t interact and pro duce side effects?

Paula: A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure they’ re safe.

Marcus: Yes, but does the left hand know what the r ight hand is doing? I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor o r pharmacist to make sure you won’t overdose by taking all three of these at one time.

Paula: But how will I fall asleep until then?

Marcus: You’re always telling me how boring I am. I ’ll just regale you with stories of my youth. Let’s start at the beginning. My earli est memory is . . .

[end of dialogue]

Paula begins our dialogue by saying to Marcus, “Oka y, I’m off to bed,” meaning I’m going to go to sleep now. Marcus says, “Wait a second” – wait. “Where are you going with all of those pill bottles?” A “pill”  (pill) is usually a small, often round object that is, in fact, medicine that you put in y our mouth and swallow. That’s one of the most common ways of taking medicine. A “ pill bottle,” then, would be a small bottle in which you keep your pills.

Paula says, “My doctor prescribed a couple of medic ations to help me sleep.” “To prescribe” (prescribe) is to write down a type of m edication that a person should take. Doctors prescribe drugs. In fact, in the Unit ed States, only licensed doctors can prescribe drugs. There are certain kinds of dru gs that you could only get if a doctor says it’s okay. These are called “prescripti on drugs.” “Prescription” comes from the verb “to prescribe.”

We also use this word “to prescribe” more generally , when people are talking about giving advice or recommendations to someone. “I prescribe three days of rest for you.” It’s as though you were a doctor and  you were giving someone a prescription. You were telling them something that would be good for them to do. Paula’s doctor “prescribed a couple of medications”  for her. “Medications” refers to drugs, medicine – in this case, pills. “Medicati on” is a general word for drugs that you are given to make you well.

Marcus says, “Let me see those. You have four diffe rent medications here. This as a pain killer, this is a sedative, this is a tra nquilizer, and this is a stimulant.” There are four different kinds of drugs mentioned h ere. The first is a “painkiller” (painkiller) – one word. A painkiller is a medicine  that, you can guess, helps reduce pain. Aspirin would be a painkiller. Codeine  would be a painkiller. A “sedative” (sedative) is a medicine that calms you down. It calms you down in order to make you sleep. A sedative makes you sleep y.

A “tranquilizer” (tranquilizer) is a medicine that makes you feel calmer. It’s a medicine that is given to reduce your anxiety, to make you less worried. Tranquilizers are also used with animals to make th em less aggressive, to quiet them down, to calm them down. My neighbor’s dog, for example, when he’s barking a little bit too much and my neighbors aren ’t home, I give him a little tranquilizer. It keeps him calm. You know what I’m saying?

A “stimulant” (stimulant) is a drug that gives you more energy, that gets you more excited. One of the most common substances that we take in the United States as a stimulant would be coffee, caffeinated coffee,  because “caffeine,” which is a substance in coffee, is a stimulant. It gets you mo re excited. So, people often have coffee, like I do, in the morning to wake them  up. Paula says, “I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.” She’s saying she d oesn’t take a stimulant when she’s going to bed because, of course, she wants to  fall asleep, not wake up. Marcus says, “You mean you take the first three eve ry night?” That is, the painkiller, the sedative, and the tranquilizer. Pau la says, “Not every night.”

Marcus says, “I can’t believe that your doctor woul d prescribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep.” Marcus doesn’t  understand why the doctor would give her three medicines to help her sleep. H e says, “This seems like overkill.” “Overkill” (overkill) is too much of som ething. For example, if you are a man and you are going out on your first date with a  woman, it would be overkill to buy her roses, buy her a new car, buy her dinner, a nd propose to marry her. That would be way too much. You would probably scare her  away. So, guys, don’t do that. That’s an example of overkill.

Paula says, “I saw more than one doctor.” Now we un derstand how Paula got all these different prescriptions. She saw different do ctors. Paula says, “They each gave me a different prescription” – each doctor. Ma rcus says, “How do you know they won’t interact and produce side effects?” When  we talk about drugs “interacting,” we’re referring to how the two thing s will work together. Sometimes drugs will give you worse problems if you take them  together. That’s why you need to tell your doctor all the different drugs yo u are taking if you are seeing more than one doctor, as is the case with Paula.

“Side effects” are other things that the drug does to your body that isn’t supposed to help you, but that sometimes can’t be avoided. S o, for example, when people take certain drugs for their allergies, the drugs make them sleepy. This is a side effect. That’s not the reason you’re taking the dru g. You’re taking the drug because of your allergies. But in addition, the dru g may also have this side effect of making you sleepy. I’ve had a few parents email me to tell me that my podcast in English makes their children sleepy, even though  the children don’t understand

English. So, I guess I could be considered a tranqu ilizer. My wife certainly thinks so whenever I talk to her.

Paula says, “A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure  they are safe.” Paula thinks the drugs are safe because she got them from doctor s, even though she got them from different doctors and didn’t tell the doc tors that she was getting these different drugs. Marcus says, “Yes” – meaning yes, they were prescri bed by doctors – “but does the left hand know what the right hand is doing?”

This is an old expression meaning that one person is doing something, and another person is doing something else, and neither  one knows what the other one is doing, so you could have some unexpected con sequences – something bad could go wrong. The left hand has to know what the right hand is doing in an organization or any group. Everyone has to know wha t everyone else is doing, typically, otherwise you may cause problems for you rself.

Marcus says, “I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you don’t overdose by taking all three  of these at one time.” Marcus is saying that he is going to “confiscate” (confisc ate) these drugs. “To confiscate” something means to take something away from someone  without the person’s permission. Usually, someone in authority can confi scate something from another person.

A teacher in a high school classroom might confisca te a student’s cell phone if the student is talking during class, or texting, or  tweeting, or Instagramming, or whatever it is that high school students do nowadays. That is an example of the verb “confiscate.” The police might confiscate drug s from your car if they find them there. So, don’t put them in your car.

Marcus says he is going to confiscate these drugs f rom Paula until Paula “can talk to a doctor or pharmacist.” A “pharmacist” (ph armacist) is someone who prepares medicines, prepares drugs to give to peopl e who have a prescription, who have permission from their doctors. A pharmacis t used to be called a “druggist,” although we don’t use that term in the United States very much anymore.

“Overdose” (overdose) is when someone takes too muc h of a drug and dies, often because of taking too much of the drug. An ov erdose doesn’t necessarily kill you, but it can kill you, and it can be very d angerous if you take too many of a certain kind of drug or medicine. Unhappily, some f amous celebrities here in Los Angeles sometimes overdose on illegal drugs.

 Marcus doesn’t want Paula to overdose on these lega l prescription drugs. Paula says, “But how will I fall asleep until then?” She’ s wondering how she is going to be able to fall asleep from now until when she has the opportunity to talk to a pharmacist or doctor. Marcus says, “You’re always t elling me how boring I am. I’ll just regale you with stories of my youth.” “To rega le” (regale) here means to tell stories to someone in a funny and interesting way, or to provide some sort of amusement to someone by talking to them.

Marcus is joking, of course. He’s saying that Paula  thinks he’s boring, so he’ll just tell Paula some stories about his youth. Your “yout h” (youth) is the years when you were growing up as a child. Marcus says, “Let’s  start at the beginning. My earliest memory is . . .” And then he, of course, s tarts telling Paula stories that are so boring that she will fall asleep. Pretty muc h what happens to my wife.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Okay, I’m off to bed.

Marcus: Wait a second. Where are you going with all  of those pill bottles?

Paula: My doctor prescribed a couple of medications  to help me sleep.

Marcus: Let me see those. You have four different m edications here. This is a painkiller, this is a sedative, this is a tranquili zer, and this is a stimulant.

Paula: I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.

Marcus: You mean you take the first three every nig ht?

Paula: Not every night.

Marcus: I can’t believe that your doctor would pres cribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep. This seems like  overkill.

Paula: I saw more than one doctor. They each gave m e a different prescription.

Marcus: How do you know they won’t interact and pro duce side effects?

Paula: A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure they’ re safe.

 Marcus: Yes, but does the left hand know what the r ight hand is doing? I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor o r pharmacist to make sure you won’t overdose by taking all three of these at one time.

Paula: But how will I fall asleep until then?

# Playing Fair in Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 988 – Playing Fair in Business.

This episode is a dialogue between Marcel and Amand a about being fair and honest in your work – at your job. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Marcel: Hey, why do you have the file for the Donov an account on your desk? I thought that was Evan’s account.

Amanda: It is, but I’m about to snatch it from him.  He won’t know what hit him.

Marcel: You’re stealing his account? If you do that , you’d better watch your back.

Amanda: You’ve got it all wrong. This is payback. T hree months ago, when I was on the verge of getting the Moralez account, Evan s wooped in and snagged it. He doesn’t play fair, and now neither do I.

Marcel: This sounds like the beginning of a feud.

Amanda: Evan started it. If he wants to play hardba ll, then what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.

Marcel: You’re not worried that he’ll up the ante a nd try to do something even more underhanded?

Amanda: Evan doesn’t scare me.

Marcel: This could easily escalate.

Amanda: Like I said, I’m not afraid of Evan. This is business. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue begins with Marcel saying, “Hey, why do you have the file for the Donovan account on your desk?” Marcel is talking to  Amanda, and he’s getting Amanda’s attention by saying, “Hey.” This is a very  common, informal way of getting someone’s attention. He says, “Why do you h ave the file for” – the papers related to – “the Donovan account on your desk?” An  “account” here refers to some sort of business relationship between your com pany and another company or someone who is buying something from your compan y. So, the Donovan account would be the purchases and other things rel ated to the company called Donovan, or the person called Donovan, and your com pany.

Marcel says, “I thought that was Evan’s account.” M arcel is saying that he thought that the Donovan account – the sales that g o to Donovan – belonged to another person, Evan. Amanda says, “It is,” meaning  it is Evan’s account, “but I’m about to snatch it from him.” “To snatch” (snat ch) is to take something quickly, unexpectedly, and without permission from someone else. Basically, it’s to steal something. We talk about “purse snatchers. ” These are the thieves, crooks, criminals who go around and take women’s pu rses from them by grabbing them from behind and running. That’s relat ed to this verb “to snatch.”

Amanda says, “He” – meaning Evan – “won’t know what  hit him.” The expression “to not know what hit you” is to be completely surp rised by something, usually something bad, something negative. Marcel says, “Yo u’re stealing his account? If you do that, you better watch your back.” “To watch  your back” is an expression meaning to be very careful. We say “watch your back ” because you can’t see behind you, and it’s easy for someone to, say, take  a knife and put it into your back. We would call that “stabbing (stabbing) your back.” You should “watch your back” because you’re doing something that might be dangerous or that someone might get angry about.

Amanda says, “You’ve got it all wrong,” meaning you  don’t understand the situation here. “This is payback.” “Payback” (payba ck) – one word – is revenge, vengeance, something mean or cruel that you do to s omeone because that person was mean or cruel to you. If someone tells l ies about you at your workplace, you might tell lies about them as paybac k. Of course, we don’t recommend that.

Amanda says, “Three months ago, when I was on the v erge of getting the Moralez account, Evan swooped in and snagged it.” “ To be on the verge” (verge) of something is to be about to do something, ready to do something. “I was on the verge of walking over and asking the woman for her telephone number, when my friend arrived first and started talking to her. ” I was on the verge of doing it. I was just about to do it.

Amanda says she was on the verge of getting another  account, of getting the business from another person for the company, when Evan “swooped in.” “To swoop (swoop) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to become involved in something very quickly – to have some effect on peo ple who were already involved in that thing. So, usually “to swoop in” w ould be to suddenly be involved in the situation. Sometimes it could be a positive thing. Sometimes it could be a negative thing. For example, we were running out of  money – we didn’t have enough money for our company – when an investor swo oped in and gave us $500,000 to help us continue our business.

Here, it’s not a good thing but a bad thing that Ev an did. He swooped in and snagged this account. “To snag” (snag) means to get  – to get something usually by doing something tricky or perhaps dishonest, alt hough it’s not always the case. This is an informal use of the verb “to snag. ” You could talk about snagging a good table at a restaurant, meaning you were able  to obtain or get a good table at a restaurant. It’s not always a bad thing.

Amanda, however, is talking about a bad thing that Evan did a few months ago when he swooped in and snagged the Morales account that Amanda was on the verge of getting. Amanda says, “Evan doesn’t play f air, and now neither do I.” “To play fair” (fair) is to be honest – not to do anyth ing mean or dishonest in dealing with other people. Because Evan is not being honest , Amanda says she’s not going to be honest.

Marcel says, “This sounds like the beginning of a f eud.” A “feud” (feud) is a long argument that often takes place over many months or  even years. Amanda says, “Evan started it,” meaning Evan was the first one to do something bad. “If he wants to play hardball, then what’s good for the go ose is good for the gander.” “To play hardball” (hardball) is to do everything p ossible in order to win – even to cheat in order to win, sometimes.

The expression “what’s good for the goose (goose) is good for the gander (gander)” means if something is good or acceptable for one person, it’s good or acceptable for everyone else. A “goose” is a type of bird. In this expression, it refers to the female of the bird. “Gander” is a mal e goose. So, sometimes this

expression is used when talking about treating men and women equally, but more generally, it just means what’s good for one p erson is good for everyone. In other words, if you think it’s good for you, then it should be good for me too or acceptable for me to do. Amanda is using this expre ssion to say that if Evan plays hardball, then she can play hardball. She sho uld be able to – she should be allowed to play hardball.

Marcel says, “You’re not worried that he’ll up the ante and try to do something even more underhanded?” “To up the ante” (ante) is an expression that comes from gambling or betting. The “ante” is the money t hat you are betting, especially in something like a card game like poker. “To up the ante” would be to increase your bet. Here, it just means to increase the risk associated with doing something, to make something more serious. “Underha nded” (underhanded) means dishonest, secretive – something that is dece itful or not fair would be underhanded. Amanda says, “Evan doesn’t scare me,” meaning she is not afraid of Evan.

But Marcel says, “This could easily escalate.” “To escalate” (escalate) means to increase or become bigger – or in this case, more s erious. If the violence escalates in a war, it becomes greater and greater.  There is more and more violence. You’ll sometimes hear this verb used nowa days when you have a problem with a company, and you contact the company , and the first person you talk to is unable to help you. That person might es calate your issue to his or her boss. Your “issue,” or problem, will then be handle d by someone with more authority or more knowledge.

Amanda says, “Like I said, I’m not afraid of Evan. This is business. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.” This expres sion, “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen” is used to tell someone tha t if they are unable to take the stress or the difficulty of a certain situation, th en they shouldn’t be in that situation. They should leave. They should let someb ody else do it. A kitchen is where, in a house or in a restaurant, you prepare f ood. “Kitchens” are often hot because of course you’re cooking the food with heat , typically. If you can’t stand – if you can’t put up with or tolerate – the heat of the kitchen, then you shouldn’t be in the kitchen.

This expression became famous in the United States in the mid-twentieth century because it was often used by President Harry Truman . Truman was known to be a very practical, level-headed, somewhat tough poli tician. It was his use of the expression that made it popular in twentieth-centur y American English, and it’s still used nowadays in precisely this situation. Am anda is saying that if Evan isn’t tough enough to handle the situation, then he shoul dn’t be involved in it.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marcel: Hey, why do you have the file for the Donov an account on your desk? I thought that was Evan’s account.

Amanda: It is, but I’m about to snatch it from him.  He won’t know what hit him.

Marcel: You’re stealing his account? If you do that , you’d better watch your back.

Amanda: You’ve got it all wrong. This is payback. T hree months ago, when I was on the verge of getting the Moralez account, Evan s wooped in and snagged it. He doesn’t play fair, and now neither do I.

This episode is a dialogue about a strike – when workers decide to stop working in order to negotiate for more money or more benefits at their job. We’re dealing today with a mass transit strike. That involves buses and subways and other means of transportation that people use in the city. Let’s get started.   [start of dialogue]  Marge: Where have you been? You should have been home over two hours ago!  Homer: I’ve been trying to get home. Haven’t you been watching the news? The Transportation Workers Union has voted to strike. There was a mass walkout at 4:30 p.m. today.  Marge: You’re kidding! I didn’t know anything about it. They walked off the job right before the afternoon commute?  Homer: Yeah, I think it was calculated to make the biggest impact so that the powers that be will sit up and take notice.  Marge: You mean the walkout has halted services on all public transportation – all buses, trains, and subways?  Homer: Yes, that’s right. Everything is at a standstill. There are a lot of disgruntled commuters out there.   Marge: When will services be restored?  Homer: I have no idea. I imagine things won’t get back to normal before tomorrow morning’s commute. # Being Socially Popular

In this episode, Rosa and Grant talk about being po pular. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rosa: Has the mail come yet?

Grant: We didn’t get any mail today.

Rosa: Damn it!

Grant: What’s the matter?

Rosa: I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party. I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the p arty of the season.

Grant: You’re worked up over a party?

Rosa: It’s not just any party. It’s the social even t of the year. Anyone who’s anybody will be there. If I don’t get an invitation , it means I’ve been snubbed. I’d never be able to live it down.

Grant: Who is Joanna anyway? She’s just another ric h girl, right?

Rosa: No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at  school and the leader of the in-crowd. If she so much as talks to you, you’re in . But if she gives you the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.

Grant: That’s ridiculous. She only has the power to  do that because you all worship her. One of these days, I hope somebody tak es her down a peg.

Rosa: But nobody would dare to go against Joanna. I t would be the end of their social life.

Grant: So what?

Rosa: So what?! I should know better than to talk a bout it with a clueless guy!

[end of dialogue]

Rosa says to Grant, “Has the mail come yet?” Has the mail arrived? Grant says, “We didn’t get any mail today.” Rosa says, “Damn it !” “Damn (damn) it” is a vulgar expression that people use informally. It’s not something you should use. Typically, I never say this, or I only say that if I’m really angry. You would never want to say it in front of children, or your boss, or people you don’t know very well.

Grant says, “What’s the matter?” What is the proble m? Rosa says, “I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party . I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the party of the season. ” Rosa is waiting for an invitation – a card or a letter asking someone to d o something, usually to go somewhere for some formal event. This invitation is  for a birthday party for Joanna. Rosa heard that Joanna is having a “big bas h.” A “bash” (bash) is a large party, a large celebration with many people.

Rosa says, “It’s going to be the party of the seaso n,” meaning the most important party of this year or this time of year. Grant says , “You’re worked up over a party?” “To be worked up” means to be excited – pos sibly worried or anxious – about something. “To get worked up over” something is to get excited or worried or perhaps even angry about something. Rosa says, “ It’s not just any party. It’s the social event of the year.” Rosa is saying this is a very important party. It’s not just any party.

The “social event of the year” would be the most im portant social event, party, or celebration that people want to go to. Normally, we  associate this expression with people who are powerful – perhaps politically power ful or, more likely, economically powerful. People who have a lot of money are involved in these kinds of large social events: the presidents of com panies, and actors, and celebrities – at least if you live here in Los Ange les. In other places, such as Washington D.C., the social events are often politi cal, or at least are attended by people with political power.

Rosa says, “Anyone who’s anybody will be there.” Th at phrase, “anyone who’s anybody,” means everyone who is important – everyon e who is important in a certain social group. She says, “If I don’t get an invitation, it means I’ve been snubbed.” “To be snubbed” (snubbed) is to be treate d badly by another person, to be ignored by someone because that person doesn’ t think you’re important enough, perhaps. Rosa is worried about being snubbe d by not being invited to this social event of the year.

She says, “I’d never be able to live it down.” The expression “to live something down” means to survive an embarrassing and difficul t situation – to remain proud and confident even though something bad happened to  you, especially something embarrassing. If a teenage boy who’s good  at basketball plays a nine- year-old girl and is beaten by the nine-year-old gi rl, he might be embarrassed because he should have won. He may find it difficul t to live that down – to not be embarrassed in the future, especially around his fr iends.

Grant says, “Who is Joanna anyway?” Grant doesn’t e ven know who this Joanna is. “She’s just another rich girl, right?” Rosa say s, “No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at school and the leader of the in-cro wd.” Now we learn that Rosa is a young girl, probably in high school. She’s talkin g about “the most popular girl at school” – the girl that everyone admires, that ever ybody wants to be friends with.

“She is the leader” – she’s the most important pers on – “of the in-crowd.” When we talk about the “in-crowd,” we’re talking about the most popular students at a school. High school usually is a place where you ha ve very popular kids and kids like me who were not very popular, honestly. I was not in the in-crowd. I was not one of the most popular students in the school. Joa nna is in the in-crowd and is very popular at Rosa’s school.

Rosa says, “If she so much as talks to you, you’re in.” The expression “so much as” is used here to mean “even.” It’s a phrase used  to emphasize the minimum amount of something. “If you so much as look at me again, I’m going to punch you.” I’m going to hit you. Just looking at me, eve n that small thing, will make me want to punch you. I don’t know why. I think you’re  nice person. I really don’t want to punch you. It’s just an example.

Rosa says that if Joanna talks to you, you’re in. A ll she has to do is talk to you, and then people will consider you to be part of the  in-crowd, part of the popular group of students. Rosa says, “But if she gives you  the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.” “To give someone the cold shoulder”  means to ignore someone, to pay no attention to someone – not to be friendly  or kind to someone. If Joanna

gives you the cold shoulder, according to Rosa, you ’re out. “You’re out” is the opposite of “you’re in.” You’re not popular. “You’r e nobody,” Rosa says.

Grant says, “That’s ridiculous. She only has the po wer to do that because you all” – meaning you other students – “worship her.” “To w orship” (worship) here means just to give a lot of respect or admiration. Normally, we use this word in talking about God or some divine power. Here, we’re  using it just to mean admire, respect, look up to. Grant continues, “One of these days, I hope somebody takes her down a peg.” “One of these days”  is a phrase meaning someday, eventually. We use this to talk about some thing that might happen in the future, even though we don’t know when, specifi cally.

Grant hopes somebody takes Joanna down a peg. “To t ake someone down a peg” (peg) means to do something to make an arrogan t person less proud – “to humble” someone, we might say. “To take someone dow n a peg” is to take somebody who thinks they’re better than everyone el se and make them realize that they’re not.

Rosa says, “But nobody would dare go against Joanna .” “To dare” (dare) is to have the courage to do something that is very diffi cult or perhaps even dangerous. “To go against” someone is to disagree w ith another person or to oppose another person. “To dare to go against” some one would be to have the courage, then, to disagree or to oppose another per son.

Rosa says, “It would be the end of their social lif e.” Your “social life” is the time that you spend outside of work and school, enjoying  yourself. If you go against Joanna, Rosa is saying, you will no longer have a g ood social life. It will be the end of your social life. Grant says, “So what?” mea ning “Why is that important? Who cares?”

Rosa says, “So what?!” She can’t believe what Grant  is saying. “I should know better than to talk about it with a clueless guy.” “Clueless” (clueless) means to be unaware of something – to not understand something or not know very much about something. It’s used as an insulting term. If  you say someone is clueless, you mean they’re so stupid they don’t realize what is going on.

Rosa is calling Grant a “clueless guy.” Here, “guy”  (guy) is used to mean “boy” or “man” – probably “boy” here, since we’re talking ab out high school students. Rosa is calling Grant “clueless” because he doesn’t  understand the importance of being part of the in-crowd, apparently.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Rosa: Has the mail come yet?

Grant: We didn’t get any mail today.

Rosa: Damn it!

Grant: What’s the matter?

Rosa: I’m waiting for an invitation from Joanna to her birthday party. I heard that she’s having a big bash, and it’s going to be the p arty of the season.

Grant: You’re worked up over a party?

Rosa: It’s not just any party. It’s the social even t of the year. Anyone who’s anybody will be there. If I don’t get an invitation , it means I’ve been snubbed. I’d never be able to live it down.

Grant: Who is Joanna anyway? She’s just another ric h girl, right?

Rosa: No, she’s not. She’s the most popular girl at  school and the leader of the in-crowd. If she so much as talks to you, you’re in . But if she gives you the cold shoulder, you’re out. You’re nobody.

Grant: That’s ridiculous. She only has the power to  do that because you all worship her. One of these days, I hope somebody tak es her down a peg.

Rosa: But nobody would dare to go against Joanna. I t would be the end of their social life.

Grant: So what?

Rosa: So what?! I should know better than to talk a bout it with a clueless guy!

# Describing Distances

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 991 – Describing Distances.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 991. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast today, won’t you? If you do, you can download the Learning Guide  for this episode, an eight- to 10-page guide that includes a complete transcrip t of everything I say – and sometimes sing.

This episode is a dialogue between Sandra and Roger  that will include vocabulary we use in English to describe distances.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: Where will we be staying when we visit Trum anville?

Roger: We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the ou tskirts of the town, but a stone’s throw from some of the major sites we’ll wa nt to see.

Sandra: I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis around. You know I hate to walk.

Roger: Trumanville is a very walkable city, and we’ ll be within walking distance to everything. We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere o n foot.

Sandra: I told you. I hate to walk. At least we’ll be within close proximity to the beach.

Roger: Actually, the areas near the beach are too e xpensive, and we can’t afford it. And plus, the beach is in a remote part of town , and staying there would mean being in the boonies for our entire trip.

Sandra: But we could take taxis.

Roger: Taking taxis everywhere would be really expe nsive.

Sandra: Tell me that we’ll at least be in the vicin ity of good shopping areas.

Roger: It might be a bit of a hike to the shops, bu t it won’t be too onerous to walk.

Sandra: Read my lips. I don’t want to walk everywhe re. Maybe we can rent a car or hire a driver.

Roger: Are you out of your mind?! This is supposed to be a budget vacation, not a luxury trip. I’m not made of money, you know.

Sandra: And I didn’t know you were such a cheapskat e!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Sandra saying to Roger, “W here will we be staying when we visit Trumanville?” Sandra wants to know wh ere they are going to be staying – overnight, we assume – when they visit th is town called Trumanville. Roger says, “We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the outskirts of the town.” The “outskirts” (outskirts) are the edges of the to wn – not in the center of the town or city, but way out where the city is about to end, basically.

Roger says they’re going to stay in a neighborhood on the outskirts of town – in an area on the outskirts of town, “but a stone’s th row from some of the major sites we’ll want to see.” The expression “a stone’s  throw” is a somewhat old one to describe a distance that is very small. Somethin g that is very close, something that is nearby, could be described as being “a ston e’s throw” from where you are, or “a stone’s throw away.” A “stone” is a rock, so if you think of how far you can throw a rock – and most of us can’t throw a rock ve ry far – that gives you an idea of why we use that expression for something very cl ose.

Sandra says, “I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis aro und. You know I hate to walk.” Sandra is hoping there’ll be a lot of taxicabs that  they can take so she doesn’t have to walk very much. Roger says, however, “Truma nville is a very walkable city.” When we call a place or a city “walkable” (w alkable), we mean the city is small enough so that you can walk from one place to  another. You don’t need to take a car. Los Angeles is not considered a very wa lkable city because everything is spread out. Everything is far away fr om the next thing you want to go to.

A place like New York City, however, is typically m ore walkable, meaning you can find all the things you want just by walking ar ound. You don’t have to take a car to get to, say, a grocery store or the museum. Trumanville, according to Roger, is a very walkable city. He says, “We’ll be within walking distance to everything.” “Walking distance” is the distance tha t you can walk. Of course,

everybody has a different tolerance for walking. for some people, walking distance could be a mile. For some people, like me,  it’s more like a hundred meters.

Roger says, “We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere on foot.” “On foot” just means by walking, by using your feet. Sandra says, “I tol d you. I hate to walk.” Roger doesn’t apparently understand, and so Sandra is try ing to be very clear with him. She says, “I told you,” which is something you migh t say to someone who you are perhaps a little angry with because the person doesn’t seem to understand something you have already told them.

Sandra says, “At least we’ll be within close proxim ity to the beach.” “To be within close proximity (proximity) to” something is to be close to something, to be near something. It’s just another way of saying nearby. Roger says, “Actually, the areas near the beach are too expensive.” Roger is s aying that if they plan on staying near the beach, in a hotel or area near the  beach, it will be very expensive. It will cost a lot of money. Roger says,  “We can’t afford it,” meaning we don’t have enough money. We can’t afford it.

“And plus,” meaning additionally, “the beach is in a remote part of town.” “Remote” (remote) means far away from everything el se, very difficult to reach or to get to. Roger says the beach is in a remote part  of Trumanville, “and staying there would mean being in the boonies for our entir e trip.” The expression “the boonies” (boonies) refers to a very rural, undevelo ped part of a state or a country, away from the city, away from where most p eople are. The term “the boonies” is an insulting one to describe the place that is far away from civilization, if you will – far away from where mos t people are.

Sandra says, “But we could take taxis.” Roger says,  “Taking taxis everywhere would be really expensive.” Sandra says, “Tell me t hat we’ll at least be in the vicinity of good shopping areas.” Sandra wants to b e able to take taxicabs, and Roger says that’s going to be too expensive. So, Sa ndra then says, “Tell me” – meaning please tell me – “that we will at least be in the vicinity of good shopping areas.” “Tell me” here is really used to mean, then , “this better be true,” or “I hope it is true.”

Sandra hopes that they will be “in the vicinity” (v icinity) of good shopping areas. “To be in the vicinity of” something is to be near something. It’s just another way of saying nearby. Sandra wants to be in the vicinit y of “good shopping areas” – places where she can go and buy things. Roger says,  “It might be a bit of a hike to the shops, but it won’t be too onerous to walk.”  “A bit of a hike” (hike) means a somewhat long distance. If someone says, “It’s a bi t of a hike,” they mean you

can walk there, but it’s going to take a while to w alk there. It’s going to take a long time to get there.

The verb “to hike” (hike) means to walk, but typica lly to walk a long distance and often to walk in areas that are outside of the city , such as a park. Here, it’s used as a noun – a “hike” – to mean a distance that you can walk. Roger says that it might be a bit of a hike to the shops, to the store s, “but it won’t be too onerous to walk.” “Onerous” (onerous) means very difficult, re quiring a lot of energy and effort. Roger says it will not be too onerous to wa lk; it won’t be too difficult.

Sandra again is not very happy with Roger, and she uses an expression that indicates that she’s not happy and that she believe s Roger is not paying attention to what she’s saying. She says, “Read my lips. I do n’t want to walk everywhere.” “Read my lips” is a phrase that you use when you are unhappy, perhaps, with someone and want them to pay very close attention to what you are about to say. It’s another way of saying, “Pay close attention to  what I’m about to tell you.”

The phrase “read my lips” became quite popular afte r George H. W. Bush, the first Bush, used it to tell people that he wasn’t g oing to raise taxes. He said “Read my lips. No new taxes.” He wasn’t going to increase  the amount of taxes that the federal government would have. After he was elected , what happened? Well, he raised taxes. He wasn’t elected a second time.

Back to our story, however. Sandra says, “Read my l ips. I don’t want to walk everywhere. Maybe we can rent a car or hire a drive r.” “To hire a driver” would be to pay someone to drive you around in their car. Ro ger says, “Are you out of your mind?” The phrase “to be out of your mind” means to  be crazy, to not be thinking rationally or logically.

Roger says, “This is supposed to be a budget vacati on, not a luxury trip. I’m not made of money, you know.” A “budget vacation” would  be a vacation that doesn’t cost very much money. A “luxury (luxury) trip” woul d be a trip that does cost a lot of money – a very expensive vacation. Roger tells S andra, “I’m not made of money,” meaning I don’t have a lot of money. We use  this expression when we don’t have a lot of money to spend and somebody wan ts us to spend a lot of money.

Sandra says, “And I didn’t know you were such a che apskate.” “To be a cheapskate” (cheapskate) is to be a person who does n’t like to spend a lot of money. To be a cheap person is to be a cheapskate. “To be cheap” means you don’t like spending money. You don’t like spending money even in cases where you probably should spend money. That’s the idea. T he word “cheapskate” is an

insulting adjective to describe a person who doesn’ t like to spend very much money, and that’s what Sandra is doing here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sandra: Where will we be staying when we visit Trum anville?

Roger: We’ll be staying in a neighborhood on the ou tskirts of the town, but a stone’s throw from some of the major sites we’ll wa nt to see.

Sandra: I hope there’ll be a lot of taxis around. You know I hate to walk.

Roger: Trumanville is a very walkable city, and we’ ll be within walking distance to everything. We’ll be able to go nearly everywhere o n foot.

# Loan Forgiveness Programs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 992 – Loan Forgiveness Programs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 992. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and take a look  at our special courses in Business and Daily English that I think you might e njoy.

This episode is a dialogue between Martin and Georg ina about trying to pay your loans by doing certain kinds of work, instead of by  giving money back to the bank. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: One hundred eleven days and counting.

Georgina: Are you counting down to something?

Martin: I’m counting down to the day when my studen t loans will be discharged. I only took this job because it qualifies for the loa n forgiveness program.

Georgina: But you’ve worked here for over two years  already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans all this  time?

Martin: That’s right. I took out loans to subsidize  my college education. After I graduated, I had a choice to either start repaying the loans or work in a public service job for three years.

Georgina: Three years is a long commitment.

Martin: You’re telling me, but I had no choice. It was either that or be indebted for the next 10 to 15 years. I couldn’t take that.

Georgina: Now I get it.

Martin: Get what?

Georgina: I’ve noticed you’ve been happier lately a nd I thought you were finally enjoying your work here, but now I know it’s becaus e you’re getting closer to getting out from under your loans.

Martin: That’s right. In less than four months I’ll  be free at last, free at last!

[end of dialogue]

Martin begins our dialogue by saying, “One hundred eleven days and counting.” The expression “and counting” is used to show that you are talking about a number that is continuing to change – often in a di rection that you want it to change. So, for example, if your company sells a hu ndred thousand dollars worth of goods, you might say, “Well, we sold one hundred  thousand dollars and counting,” which means I expect we will sell even m ore. We are continuing to sell and that number will get higher.

Martin says, “One hundred eleven days and counting. ” But here, he means it in the opposite way – of the number is going down ever y day. That’s why Georgina says, “Are you counting down to something?” “To cou nt down” is a phrasal verb meaning to count backwards until an event happens. So, we might say there are 264 days left until Christmas, and tomorrow there w ill be 263 days left until Christmas, and so on. You are counting down.

Martin says, “I’m counting down to the day when my student loans will be discharged.” “Student loans” are loans that you get  from a bank – money that you get from a bank, typically, that you use to pay for  your university or college expenses. When a loan is “discharged” (discharged),  we mean that you no longer have to pay it because you have done somethi ng that the government or the bank accepts in lieu of, or in place of, money.

To have a loan “discharged” is to do something othe r than pay money back, typically – that the government says, “Okay, you do n’t have to pay any more money back because you did this.” This has become q uite popular for certain kinds of student loans in the United States. The go vernment or the bank gives you money, but then you have to do something – typi cally you have to work at a certain job or in a certain area – and if you do th at, then the government will forgive your loan. It will discharge your loan and not make you pay it back.

Martin says, “I only took this job because it quali fies for the loan forgiveness program.” “To qualify for” something is to meet the  requirements for something. A “loan forgiveness program” is what I was just talki ng about – a program where, instead of paying the bank or the government back m oney that you loaned from

them, you do something and the government says, “Ok ay, you don’t have to pay it back.”

Now, typically these programs are for teachers or s ometimes doctors or nurses who agree to work in certain places that need teach ers or doctors or nurses. It’s usually not a place where a lot of people want to g o or a place where people want to work, and that’s why the government says, “ Well, if you work here for two years or three years or however many years it takes  according to the loan forgiveness program, then you will not have to pay the loan back. You will not have to give the bank or the government back money.

I actually had one of these loans when I became a t eacher, a high school teacher. I received a loan from the federal governm ent, and if I worked for a certain number of years as a teacher, I would not h ave to pay the loan back. That’s a loan forgiveness program.

Georgina says, “You’ve worked here for over two yea rs already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans a ll this time?” Georgina was not aware – did not know – that Martin was working at this job, whatever this job is, for the past two years so that he could pay off  his student loans. “To pay off” is a phrasal verb meaning to make all of the payments on a debt that you have. So, if you borrow a thousand dollars from the bank and you “pay it off,” you pay the bank back the thousand dollars plus, of course, wha t is called “interest,” which is the money the bank charges to loan you money.

Martin here isn’t technically giving the bank or the government money. He is working in this job as a way of paying off his stud ent loan, of getting rid of the student loan, if you will. Martin says, “That’s rig ht” – that’s correct – “I took out loans to subsidize my college education.” I got loa ns to pay for my college education. That’s what Martin means here. “To subsi dize” is to provide financial support for something that you would not otherwise be able to afford.

Martin says, “After I graduated, I had a choice to either start repaying the loans or work in a public service job for three years.” Mart in says when he finished his college education – when he got his college degree – he had a choice of one of two things. He could either take a regular job and start paying the loans back with money, or he could work in a public service job for  three years. “Public service” refers to jobs that help the public, usually govern ment jobs that help the public.

Georgina says, “Three years is a long commitment.” A “commitment” (commitment) is a promise to do something, an oblig ation to do something. Georgina thinks three years is a long commitment, a  long time to say you’re

going to work at this job. That really depends, of course. It depends on how much money you are going to save by not having to pay it  back to the government.

Martin, however, agrees with Georgina. You’re telli ng me.” That expression, “You’re telling me,” is an informal way of showing your agreement with what the other person said. So, someone may say to you, “This examination is really hard. This test is really hard,” and you agree with that person. You may say, “You’re telling me,” meaning yes, I agree with you. Martin says, “I had no choice.” Well, actually, Martin did have a choice. He had a choice  of not going to college and taking out the loan. But we continue, “It was eithe r that or be indebted for the next ten to fifteen years.”

Martin says either he worked at this job for three years – this public service job – as part of the loan forgiveness program, or he woul d be “indebted” (indebted) for the next ten to fifteen years. “To be indebted” is to owe money to someone. Sometimes we use that expression, “I’m indebted to you,” when a person does something very nice for you or something perhaps th at cost a lot of money, even. You may say to them, “I’m indebted to you” – I real ly appreciate what you’ve done for me, and I hope someday to be able to do so mething good for you. That’s the general idea.

Here, however, Martin is talking about actually bei ng indebted, actually having to pay money to the bank or the government or whomever  he got the loan from. Georgina says, “Now I get it,” meaning now I unders tand. Martin says, “Get what?” What do you understand? Georgina says, “I’ve  noticed you’ve been happier lately” – recently – “and I thought you wer e finally enjoying your work here, but now I know it’s because you’re getting cl oser to getting out from under your loans.”

Georgina has noticed that Martin has become happier  recently and now she understands why: because he is getting closer to the point where he no longer has to work at this job. He’s getting closer to get ting out from under his loans. “To get out from under” means to be freed of some burde n, to be relieved of some burden or obligation. You no longer have to do some thing that you had to do but didn’t want to do. Martin says, “That’s right. In l ess than four months, I’ll be free at last, free at last!”

This expression “free at last” means that you will be finally freed of this obligation. You will finally no longer have to do this thing th at you don’t want to do. This expression “free at last, free at last” is actually  one that became famous in the early 1960s, when the late Reverend Martin Luther K ing gave a famous speech in Washington, and at the end or towards the end of  the speech, he used the

phrase “Free at last, free at last” to talk about the liberation, or the potential freeing, of African Americans from the discriminati on and the racism that existed in American society at that time.

Martin, of course, is not talking about being free of discrimination. He’s talking about being free of having to pay his loans.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: One hundred eleven days and counting.

Georgina: Are you counting down to something?

Martin: I’m counting down to the day when my studen t loans will be discharged. I only took this job because it qualifies for the loa n forgiveness program.

Georgina: But you’ve worked here for over two years  already. You mean you’ve been working to pay off your student loans all this  time?

# Doing Spring Cleaning

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 993 – Doing Spring Cleaning.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 993. I’m your host, Dr Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Like us on Faceboo k at facebook.com/eslpod, and follow us on Twitter at @eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue about cleaning the house . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Malcolm: Do we really need to start doing spring cl eaning today?

Lorna: We really should. The drapes need to be wash ed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out. And w e really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.

Malcolm: That’s a lot of work for two people.

Lorna: And I haven’t even mentioned what needs to b e done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.

Malcolm: I’m not sure I have the energy for all tha t.

Lorna: We also need to wash the windows, window scr eens, and windowsills, steam clean the carpets, and sweep out the garage.

Malcolm: If we hope to do all of that this weekend,  then I think we need reinforcements.

Lorna: What do you have in mind?

Malcolm: I’m not the high school football coach for  nothing. Lorna: You mean . . .?

Malcolm: I think the guys need an extra-hard workou t this weekend.

 [end of dialogue]

We begin this episode with Malcolm asking Lorna, “D o we really need to start doing spring cleaning today?” “Spring cleaning” is something that Americans traditionally do in the springtime. It means to cle an your entire house – to give a very thorough, detailed, if you will, cleaning of y our house and organizing of things before summertime, I guess. We tend to do it  in the spring – at least, that is what has traditionally been the case – but reall y the expression refers to a very thorough cleaning and organization of your house.

Malcolm wants to know if they have to start doing s pring cleaning today, and Lorna says, “We really should” – we really ought to . “The drapes need to be washed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the at tic needs cleaning out.” The “drapes” (drapes) are the coverings, that are typic ally made of cloth, that cover your windows. You can have a lot of different thing s that cover your windows. You could have shades, you could have blinds, or yo u could have drapes. Drapes are made of cloth, usually – a thick materia l that hangs down and covers the window when you want it covered.

“To wipe down” something is to clean it, usually by  using a paper towel or a cloth that is wet. You take the cloth or the towel and yo u move it in an up-and-down direction in order to clean something. In this case , we’re wiping down the walls, which are probably dirty. Finally, Lorna mentions the attic that needs cleani ng out. The “attic” (attic) is located at the very top of a house, immediately bel ow the roof. Not all houses have attics. If your roof is flat, you don’t have a n attic. But if your roof comes to a point, then you typically will have some space betw een the wall and the top of the house, whatever floor that is.

If you have a two-story house, a two-level house, there’ll be space between the ceiling of the second floor and the top of the roof . That space is called an “attic” and is typically used for storage, for keeping thin gs – boxes and other things – that you don’t need to have out to use, but want to  keep. In some big houses, the attic is actually finished off – that is, walls are  put up so that you can actually sleep there. In my house that I grew up in as a chi ld, our attic was finished, which meant that you could go up there and sleep – and in deed, that’s where four of my brothers slept when I was growing up, and I eventua lly slept there when I got older.

But enough about me – back to Malcolm and Lorna and  the attic that needs cleaning out. “To clean out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to clean

completely. The “out” is used mostly for emphasis h ere to indicate that you are doing something very thoroughly. “I need to clean o ut my desk.” I need to get everything out of my desk. That actually is a phrase that you might hear if you are fired. You may tell someone to clean out their desk, meaning take all of your things with you because you don’t work here anymore . Here we’re just talking about cleaning out the attic in the house.

Lorna continues, “And we really should clean the up holstery on the sofa and dining chairs.” “Upholstery” (upholstery) is the cl oth that covers the chair or the couch or some place where you sit. You have upholst ery in your car, for example, over the seats that you sit on. You have u pholstery on a sofa or a couch. You have upholstery, typically, on nice chai rs. If the chair is made of wood and there is no cushion on it, then it doesn’t have  any upholstery, typically. But if there is a cushion that makes it soft and nice to s it on, then usually that will have upholstery on it – that chair will have upholstery.

Malcolm, who obviously doesn’t want to work very ha rd, says, “That’s a lot of work for two people.” Lorna continues, “And I haven ’t even mentioned” – I haven’t even said anything about – “what needs to b e done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.” “To defrost (defrost) a freezer (freezer)”  is to turn the freezer off and let all of the ice – if there is ice inside of the freezer – melt in order to clean it out thoroughly.

A “freezer” is a place where you put food that you want to keep frozen – below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. “To defrost” means to clean out  all the ice. And the old freezers – and I don’t think this is as common anym ore – you used to have to defrost your freezer every few months or so if you wanted to clean it, because it would collect all sorts of ice inside of the freeze r. At least, when I was growing up, that was the case with the freezer we had.

“Cabinets” (cabinets) are also called “cupboards” ( cupboards). They’re basically wooden boxes with a door on them that are in your k itchen or other parts of your house where you keep things. “Kitchen cabinets” usu ally have dishes and pans and probably some food in them. Lorna is talking ab out cleaning out the cabinets – taking everything out of them and cleaning them. She also mentions “scrubbing the floors.” “To scrub” (scrub) usually means to ru b something very hard in order to clean it – to move a cloth or perhaps some other  instrument in order to clean something that is dirty and that requires that you use some physical force to get it clean.

Malcolm, again, seems to question whether he really  has the strength to do this. He says, “I’m not sure I have the energy for all th at.” But Lorna continues, “We also need to wash the windows, window screens and w indowsills, steam the carpets, and sweep out the garage.” The “window scr eens” (screens) are basically thin pieces of wire or plastic that are p ut up in your window to allow you to open the window without having insects and other  things from the outside come inside your house. So you open up, say, your g lass window, but you don’t want bugs or mosquitoes or something to fly into yo ur house, so you put up a metal screen that allows the air to come in and out , but nothing else.

Lorna says they have to wash the “window screens an d windowsills” (windowsills). A “windowsill” is a flat piece of wo od at the bottom of the window. It’s sort of the bottom part of the window. Lorna m entions “steam cleaning the carpets.” “To steam (steam) clean the carpets” is to use a machine that cleans the carpets or other cloth furniture that you have using water vapor, which is what steam is. If you take water and you heat it up, you  will create water vapor, or steam. These are machines that used to be popular –  I’m sure you can still find them today; they’re still used today – that clean c arpets quickly and thoroughly by using hot steam as part of the process.

Lorna also mentions sweeping out the garage. “To sw eep” (sweep) is to use a broom in order to push dust and dirt on the floor i nto something called a “dustpan” in order to clean the floor. The use of the word “out” here is once again mostly for emphasis. “To sweep out” means to clean and sweep very thoroughly.

Malcolm says, “If we hope to do all of that this we ekend, then I think we need reinforcements.” “Reinforcements” here refers to ot her people who can help you. Normally, we use that term in the military when we’ re talking about fighting a war and you need more soldiers, you need more troops. You bring in new men and women to help you fight. Those would be reinforceme nts. Here, Malcolm is using it sort of as a joke. He’s not actually talking abo ut fighting a war. He’s talking about doing the cleaning.

Lorna says, “What do you have in mind?” Malcolm say s, “I’m not the high school football coach for nothing.” We use an expression s uch as this, “I’m not a high school football coach for nothing,” to indicate tha t there is some benefit to this situation – some additional benefit, in this case, to the situation. What Malcolm is suggesting is that, because he is the coach of the local high school football team, he can get the boys from the football team to come over and help do the spring cleaning.

Lorna says, “You mean . . .?” Malcolm then replies,  “I think the guys need an extra-hard workout this weekend.” A “workout” (work out) is a period of time when you exercise, which for me is usually never. What M alcolm is saying here is that he’s going to bring the members of the football tea m into his house to help him clean it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Malcolm: Do we really need to start doing spring cl eaning today?

Lorna: We really should. The drapes need to be wash ed, the walls need to be wiped down, and the attic needs cleaning out. And w e really should clean the upholstery on the sofa and dining chairs.

Malcolm: That’s a lot of work for two people.

Lorna: And I haven’t even mentioned what needs to b e done in the kitchen. We need to defrost the freezer, clean the oven, clean out the cabinets, and scrub the floors.

Malcolm: I’m not sure I have the energy for all tha t.

Lorna: We also need to wash the windows, window scr eens, and windowsills, steam clean the carpets, and sweep out the garage.

Malcolm: If we hope to do all of that this weekend,  then I think we need reinforcements.

Lorna: What do you have in mind?

Malcolm: I’m not the high school football coach for  nothing. Lorna: You mean . . .?

Malcolm: I think the guys need an extra-hard workou t this weekend.

# Describing Accuracy and Inaccuracy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 994 – Describing Accuracy and Inaccuracy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 994. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com and become a member  of ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue about vocabulary we use to describe accura cy and inaccuracy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?

Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.

Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.

Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.

Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye t hree times already.

Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighbor hood of the bullseye.

Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’ m hitting wide of the mark every time!

Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.

Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.

Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.

[end of dialogue]

The topic of this episode is describing accuracy an d inaccuracy. “Accuracy” (accuracy) can refer to whether something is true o r correct. “Accuracy” is also used sometimes to refer to precision – whether some thing that you are trying to accomplish is done not only correctly, but precisel y; that you are able, for example, to throw something and hit what you are tr ying to hit. If you hit it, you are being accurate. You are, in a sense, accomplish ing what you are trying to accomplish. We see the latter use of that term “acc uracy” in this dialogue. “Inaccuracy,” of course, would mean not accurate.

Rona starts by saying, “This is impossible. I’m nev er going to hit the target.” A “target” (target) is a person or thing that you are  trying to hit. That’s why we are talking about accuracy in this dialogue, because we ’re talking about trying to hit something for sport, as in part of a game. This is the sport of “archery” (archery). “Archery” is using what’s called a “bow” and “arrow ” to hit a target.

The “bow” is usually a piece of metal or wood that has a string attached on the top and the bottom. You put a long, narrow piece of  wood or metal in the string, and you pull the string back in order to shoot it. That long narrow thing is called the “arrow” (arrow). Archery is a sport that uses b ows and arrows. In this dialogue, Rona asks, “Why is it I’m the only one in  this archery class who has no aim?” She’s trying to make the arrow hit the target , but she says she has “no aim” (aim). “Aim” here is the ability to direct som ething such as an arrow so that it will hit your target.

Usually in archery the target is a series of circle s, and you’re supposed to hit the middle circle in the center, and that is your goal.  Rona says she doesn’t have very good aim. She isn’t able to direct the arrow s o that it hits the target properly. Leonardo says, however, “You’re doing fine. I can t ell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.” “Precision ” (precision) is being able to be exact. Here, it’s just another word for accuracy .

Rona says, “But you seem to be picking it up quickl y.” “To pick something up” is a phrasal verb which here means to learn how to do something. You can also pick something up literally, with your hand – you can put your hand down and pick up a pen, for example – but in this case, it m eans to learn something quickly.

Leonardo says, “I’m taking this class as a refreshe r.” A “refresher” is when you do something that you already have learned how to d o, but need to be reminded again. You need to practice, perhaps, this skill so me more. A refresher would be a class you take to remind you how to do the things  you’ve already learned how

to do. Leonardo says, “My father taught me the rudi ments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.” The  “rudiments” (rudiments) of something are the basics of something, the basic sk ills to do something.

“To take something up” is to learn how to do someth ing, to begin to learn how to do something. “To take up playing the piano,” for e xample, would be to learn how to play the piano, to start learning how to play the piano. So, “to take up” something is to start learning how to do something.  “To pick up something quickly” is to learn something quickly. “To take up ” emphasizes the fact that you’re just beginning to learn something, that you are starting to learn it.

Rona says to Leonardo, “You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye three times already.” A “bullseye” (bullseye) is the center of the target. Remember, I was talking about how targets in archery are usually ci rcles, what we would call “concentric circles” – circles that go around other  circles. Well, the center circle is the “bullseye.” Leonardo says, “I’m using a much mo re forgiving bow than you are.” The word “forgiving” here means that you can make more mistakes with it and it will still work okay; it will function prope rly even though you’re not great at using it.

Leonardo says, “If I aim for the target” – if I try  to shoot at the target – “I can usually get the arrow in the neighborhood of the bu llseye.” “In the neighborhood of” here means close to – not exactly on the target , not exactly where you want it to go, but close to there. Rona says, “You’re just trying to make me feel better” – you’re just trying to make me happier because I’m n ot very good at this.

She says, “I’m hitting wide of the mark every time. ” The phrase “wide (wide) of the mark (mark)” means not close to where you are s upposed to be, in this case, shooting the arrow. So, hitting it “wide of the mar k” means not being very close at all. Leonardo says, “I think your arms are too tens e and that tension is ruining your accuracy.” If you describe someone’s arms and legs as “tense” (tense), you mean that they’re very tight. Tense is the opposite  of relaxed. “Accuracy,” we’ve already discussed, is precision.

Leonardo then offers to help Rona, and Rona says, “ Watch out,” meaning be careful. “With my aim, I could take you out.” Rona is making a joke here. “To take someone out” here means to kill someone, to end som eone’s life. Rona says, “With my aim” – since I’m such a bad shot, since I’ m such a bad archer – I could kill you just by shooting my arrow. By accident, of  course.

Leonardo, of course, is interested in Rona. He’s in terested, in fact, in taking Rona out, but not in killing her – in taking her on a da te. That’s interesting. I’ve never

thought about the fact that we use that phrasal ver b “to take out” to mean both to take someone on a romantic date and to kill someone . Interesting. There might be some relationship there. I don’t know.

Leonardo says at the end, “I’ll take my chances.” H e again is joking. He says, “I’ll take my chances,” meaning I will do this even if it  is risky and dangerous, because I want to help you – because, of course, he  likes her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rona: This is impossible. I’m never going to hit the target. Why is it that I’m the only one in this archery class who has no aim?

Leonardo: You’re doing fine. I can tell you’re new to this. It takes some practice to develop any precision.

Rona: But you seem to be picking it up quickly.

Leonardo: I’m taking this class as a refresher. My father taught me the rudiments of archery when I was a kid, and I thought I would take it up again.

Rona: You’re really good. You’ve hit the bullseye t hree times already.

Leonardo: I’m using a much more forgiving bow than you are. If I aim for the target, I can usually get the arrow in the neighbor hood of the bullseye.

Rona: You’re just trying to make me feel better. I’ m hitting wide of the mark every time!

Leonardo: I think your arms are too tense and that tension is ruining your accuracy. Here, let me help you.

Rona: Watch out. With my aim, I could take you out.

Leonardo: I’ll take my chances.

# Proper Behavior at a Formal Event

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 995 – Proper Behavior at a Formal Event.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 995. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. You can also like us on Facebook at facebook.com/eslpod.

On this episode, we’re going to talk about how you should act – how you should behave – at a formal event. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rodney: Ha-ha! Did you hear what I said? Funny, rig ht?

Samantha: Behave yourself! This is a serious and so lemn occasion, not a time for levity.

Rodney: Loosen up. We have to endure two hours of t his ceremony.

Samantha: It’s indecent the way you’re behaving. Do n’t you have any sense of decorum?

Rodney: Lighten up. You’re such a stick-in-the-mud.  There’s nothing unseemly about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is t aking themselves too seriously.

Samantha: Your problem is that you have no sense of  dignity. Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re  a disgrace.

Rodney: Don’t get all huffy. All right, if you won’ t join in, I’ll try to be serious.

Samantha: That’s better.

Rodney: I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!

Samantha: [Groans]

 [end of dialogue]

Rodney begins our dialogue by laughing, which we no rmally write as “Ha (ha) – ha (ha).” Rodney says, “Did you hear what I said? F unny, right?” meaning “Am I not right? Wasn’t it funny?” Samantha is not happy.  She says to Rodney, “Behave yourself.” When you tell someone to “behave ” (behave) himself or herself, you’re telling them to act in a way that w ould not bother other people, to act in a way that is what we would call “socially a cceptable.” So if you’re at a funeral, you’re not going to be going around laughi ng. If you’re at a wedding, you’re not going to go around crying. Those are not  socially acceptable behaviors in those situations.

You may also say this to a young child who is yelli ng or doing something that he shouldn’t be doing. You may say the child, “Behave yourself.” My mother used to say that to me a lot. Samantha continues, “This is a serious and solemn occasion, not a time for levity.” “Solemn” (solemn)  means serious, respectful – something that would describe a formal occasion abo ut something that was very serious. Samantha says, “This is not a time for lev ity” (levity). “Levity” is the opposite of solemn. “Levity” is related to humor, of making jokes about things.

Rodney doesn’t agree with Samantha. He says, “Loose n up.” This phrase “loosen (loosen) up” means be relaxed. Don’t be so serious. He says, “We have to endure two hours of this ceremony. “To endure” ( endure) means to tolerate or put up with something that is difficult or unpleasa nt – to suffer through something patiently. You can endure a difficult time in your life. You could endure watching a terrible movie for two hours with your wife becau se you love her and you told her that you would go and watch the movie with her – just an example. Rodney is talking about having to endure two hours of this ce remony. We’re not quite sure what the ceremony is for.

Samantha says, “It’s indecent the way you’re behavi ng.” “Indecent” (indecent) is the opposite of “decent.” “Decent” would be proper,  correct – something that is socially acceptable. “Indecent” would be something that is not correct, not appropriate for the situation. “Indecent” also has the meaning of being perhaps sexually inappropriate in a situation. Maybe tellin g jokes, for example, that are not appropriate.

Samantha says, “Don’t you have any sense of decorum ?” “Decorum” (decorum) refers to behavior that is considered socially acce ptable, especially in formal situations, in formal circumstances. Samantha is as king Rodney if he has any sense of decorum, meaning does he really even under stand what it means to

behave properly in a situation such as this. Once a gain, Rodney disagrees with Samantha’s opinion. He says to her something simila r that he said just a minute ago, “Lighten up.” “Lighten up” is the same as “loo sen up.” It means, again, to stop being so serious, stop being so sad, perhaps.

He says, “You’re such a stick-in-the-mud.” The phra se “stick-in-the-mud” refers to someone who isn’t very adventurous, someone who is dull, someone who is boring. Rodney continues, “There’s nothing unseemly  about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is taking themselves too seriou sly.” “Unseemly” (unseemly) again refers to behavior that is not appropriate for a certain setting, a certain situation, especially a formal one. Rodney says tha the’s “cracking a few jokes.” “To crack (crack) a joke” is to tell a joke, to say  something that is funny.

Rodney says, “Everybody here,” wherever they are, “ is taking themselves too seriously.” “To take yourself too seriously” is to worry too much about how you appear to other people and to think that what you s ay and what you think are very important to everyone else. “To take yourself too seriously” is to think that you are more important to other people than you rea lly are. Samantha says, “Your problem is that you have no sense of dignity. ” Samantha is once again criticizing Rodney, saying he has no sense of “dign ity” (dignity). “Dignity” refers to having a serious manner, causing other people to lo ok at you with respect.

She continues, “Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re a disgrace.” “To cheapen” (cheapen) is to lo wer the quality of something, to cause something to be seen as worse than it real ly is. “To cheapen the occasion” would be to take a formal or serious situ ation and make it less serious, but also less respected. Samantha says to Rodney, “ You’re a disgrace.” If you call someone a “disgrace” (disgrace), you’re saying  that they are very bad because they have done something bad or unacceptabl e and you no longer respect them. You no longer think well of them.

Rodney isn’t all that interested in Samantha’s opin ion. He says, “Don’t get all huffy.” “To be huffy” (huffy) is to be annoyed, to be bothered, to be irritated. We would describe someone is being “huffy,” or “in a h uff,” when we don’t think they have a good reason to be angry and upset. It’s a cr iticism of someone to say something like, “Don’t get all huffy.” “Alright,” R odney says, “if you won’t join in, I’ll try to be serious,” meaning if you don’t want to have fun with me, I’ll try to be serious. Samantha says, “That’s better.” She’s happ y. Then Rodney says, “I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!”

And then Samantha “groans” – she makes a sound that  indicates that she’s really unhappy. Rodney says he’s going to be seriou s, but then he makes a joke

and says, “I would seriously like a drink.” Here, h e’s using the word “serious” to mean very much, or really. He’s not being serious i n the sense of being solemn or respectful. He’s using the adverb “seriously” to  mean really. Then he calls for the bartender, which is the person whose job it is to mix and serve you alcoholic drinks at a bar, or perhaps at some formal receptio n or ceremony where they have alcohol.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rodney: Ha-ha! Did you hear what I said? Funny, rig ht?

Samantha: Behave yourself! This is a serious and so lemn occasion, not a time for levity.

Rodney: Loosen up. We have to endure two hours of t his ceremony.

Samantha: It’s indecent the way you’re behaving. Do n’t you have any sense of decorum?

Rodney: Lighten up. You’re such a stick-in-the-mud.  There’s nothing unseemly about cracking a few jokes when everybody here is t aking themselves too seriously.

Samantha: Your problem is that you have no sense of  dignity. Don’t you realize that your stupid jokes cheapen the occasion? You’re  a disgrace.

Rodney: Don’t get all huffy. All right, if you won’ t join in, I’ll try to be serious.

Samantha: That’s better.

Rodney: I would seriously like a drink. Bartender!

Samantha: [Groans]

# Importing Goods to the U.S.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 996 – Importing Goods to the U.S.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 996. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue between Muriel and Daniel about importing, or bring ing into the United States, goods – things to sell. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Daniel: You look like you’re sitting on pins and ne edles.

Muriel: I am. I’m waiting to hear if our goods have  cleared customs yet. We’re in big trouble if our 50 crates aren’t released soon.

Daniel: You’ve filled out the proper paperwork. Wha t could go wrong?

Muriel: You have no idea how much red tape there is  when importing goods to the U.S. There are all kinds of rules to follow, an d we have to pay the correct tariffs.

Daniel: But I thought we had a free-trade agreement  with Niebuhrland. All goods imported from and exported to Niebuhrland should be  duty-free.

Muriel: Most things are duty-free, but not everythi ng. There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax rate varies depending on the type of sp irits. It’s all very confusing.

Daniel: Well, sitting here fretting won’t do any go od.

Muriel: If only I had access to those 50 crates of spirits . . .

[end of dialogue]

Daniel begins our dialogue by saying, “You look lik e you’re sitting on pins and needles.” Daniel is talking to Muriel. The expressi on “to be sitting on pins (pins) and needles (needles)” means to be very nervous, to  be worried, to be anxious,

especially while you’re waiting for something to ha ppen. If you’ve taken an important examination and you’re waiting for the re sults, you could say that you are “sitting on pins and needles.”

Pins and needles are sharp objects, and obviously i f you were sitting on a sharp object, it would be very painful. So, waiting for n ews – being worried about something that may happen – can be a little painful . That’s what the expression here means, “sitting on pins and needles.” Muriel s ays, “I am.” I am, basically, anxious or worried. “I’m waiting to hear if our goo ds have cleared customs yet.” “Goods” is a general word meaning “products,” thing s that you make.

We usually distinguish “goods” from “services,” thi ngs that you do for people. So, a lawyer provides a “service,” and a store may prov ide a “good.” You buy some milk from the grocery store – that’s a “good.” You ask a lawyer to help you with some legal issue – that’s a “service.” Muriel is “w aiting to hear” – that is, waiting to find out – “if our goods have cleared customs ye t.” “Customs” (customs) here means the process that a country has for checking to make sure that things that are brought into the country are legal and, dependi ng on the item, have been assessed a tax.

When you bring things into a country, the country w ill often have taxes that you have to pay to bring that item into the country, es pecially if you’re going to sell it in the country. So, when you import – when you brin g things into a country – here in the United States, you may have to pay certain t axes when you bring the items into the country, and the place where you pay those  taxes, the office that takes care of that for the U.S. government, is called “cu stoms.”

The opposite of “import” is “export” (export). That  means to send things to another country. But here we’re talking about impor ting goods into the United States. Muriel says, “We’re in big trouble if our 5 0 crates aren’t released soon.” A “crate” (crate) is a large, usually wooden containe r that typically has holes in it. We often use crates when we are transporting food s uch as fruit and vegetables. “To be released” means to be let go. In this case, it means that the crates are with the customs office, and you are waiting for the customs office to let you pick them up – take them away.

Daniel says, “You’ve filled out the proper paperwor k. What could go wrong?” “Paperwork” is a general term referring to document s that you have to complete, forms that you have to fill out in order to get som ething done. The government – all governments – require lots of paperwork. You ha ve to fill out this form, and then you have to give them this document, and so forth.

Muriel says, “You have no idea how much red tape there is when importing goods to the U.S.” The term “red tape” refers to di fficult rules or requirements, usually by the government, that you must follow in order to do something. “Red tape” could involve regulations and rules. It could  also involve filling out lots of forms – that is, a lot of paperwork.

You may wonder why we call it “red tape.” The answe r is that the expression was originally used in England. The British government,  when it had official papers, official documents to send, would tie them up with this red tape, and you had to untie the tape in order to read the documents and then tie them back up and send them to the next place. So, eventually this ex pression became a way of indicating useless and needless delays when it took  too long for something to happen, and that’s how it is used today to talk abo ut government regulations and rules that take a lot of time but don’t seem very n ecessary. They don’t seem useful.

Muriel says, “There’s a lot of red tape when you are importing,” or bringing into the country, “goods.” She says, “There are all kind s of rules to follow, and we have to pay the correct tariffs.” A “tariff” (tarif f) is what we call that special tax you have to pay when you bring things into a country. T he tariffs have to be paid before you are allowed to bring things in, before y ou are allowed to take them and sell them. Daniel says, “But I thought we had a  free-trade agreement with Niebuhrland?” Niebuhrland is not a real place, alth ough I do know someone named Niebuhr.

“Free-trade agreements” are treaties – agreements b etween countries that allow businesses in each of those countries to sell their  products without having to pay tariffs. Here in North America, we have something c alled NAFTA, the “North American Free Trade Agreement,” which is supposed to allow businesses in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico to sell to customers i n those three countries without having to pay a lot of special tariffs. Of course, it usually doesn’t work out exactly that way. There are usually exceptions to a ny sort of free-trade agreement, but that’s the general idea.

Daniel continues, “All goods imported from and expo rted to Niebuhrland should be duty-free.” We already talked about the meaning of the verb “to export.” The term “duty (duty) free” means that you don’t have to pay any taxes or tariffs. In many countries, at the airport, if you are travelin g internationally, if you are leaving the country, there will be a “duty-free sho p,” a place where you can buy expensive things – watches, alcohol, and so forth –  without paying the local taxes. That’s a duty-free shop. Well, being able to  import and export duty-free

means you don’t have to pay any special taxes as a business. You don’t have to pay any tariffs.

Muriel says, “Most things are duty-free, but not ev erything. There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax rate varies depending on the t ype of spirits. It’s all very confusing.” “Spirits” (spirits) here refers to alco hol. It’s sort of an older word, but you will still see it, especially when you’re talki ng about tariffs and taxes. Muriel says, “There are tariffs on spirits, and the tax ra te varies.” The “tax rate” is the amount, or percentage of the price of the good, tha t you have to pay to the government. “Varies” means it changes. In this case , it changes depending on the type of alcohol, the type of spirits.

Daniel says, “Well, sitting here fretting won’t do any good.” “To fret” (fret) means to worry about something, especially something that  you don’t have any control over. Of course, if you can’t control something, there’s no reason to worry about it, but we all do. We all fret over things that we can’t control.

Muriel says, “If only I had access to those 50 crat es of spirits.” “To have access to” means to be able to reach them. Muriel is makin g a joke here. She’s saying that if she had access to the alcohol, then she wou ldn’t have to worry as much because she could drink the alcohol. That’s the gen eral idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Daniel: You look like you’re sitting on pins and ne edles.

Muriel: I am. I’m waiting to hear if our goods have  cleared customs yet. We’re in big trouble if our 50 crates aren’t released soon.

Daniel: You’ve filled out the proper paperwork. Wha t could go wrong?

Muriel: You have no idea how much red tape there is  when importing goods to the U.S. There are all kinds of rules to follow, an d we have to pay the correct tariffs.

This episode is a dialogue between Oscar and Liz ab out writing your memoir – the story of your life. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Oscar: We’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing you r memoir with our company. You’ve had such an interesting life. I’m sure you’l l have lots of titillating stories to tell.

Liz: Well, my memoir will certainly have a lot of s tories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encou ntered in this industry.

Oscar: That’s nice, but people buy autobiographical  books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.

Liz: I was really thinking of focusing on the peopl e who helped me in my career and their selflessness.

Oscar: But I thought you were interested in writing  a tell-all book. Considering how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must have lots of steamy stories.

Liz: I don’t want to be telling tales about people I love or once loved. I want to focus on the positive.

Oscar: You could do that, but your books won’t fly off the shelves without those juicy details.

Liz: Really?

 Oscar: Really.

Liz: Maybe I could tell one or two scandalous stori es.

Oscar: Now you’re talking.

Liz: There was that infamous party where a cat figh t broke out between . . .

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Oscar saying to Liz, “We ’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing your memoir with our company. You’ve had  such an interesting life. I’m sure you’ll have lots of titillating stories to  tell.” Oscar says that he and his company are “thrilled.” “To be thrilled” means to b e very excited, to be very pleased with something.

“To publish” means to create a book, a newspaper, o r a magazine – typically, things that are printed on paper and then you buy. However, that’s the traditional definition of “publish.” Now people publish things electronically. The more general use of the term, then, is to make something availab le for people to buy. It’s usually in the form of a book or a magazine or news paper. You can also publish on a blog. So, the Internet has really changed our definition of “publish.”

Oscar is talking about publishing Liz’s memoir. A “ memoir” (memoir) is a written account of your life. It’s an “autobiography,” we c ould also call it. It’s the story of your life. Oscar says that Liz’s stories are almost  certain to be titillating. “To be titillating” (titillating) means to be very interes ting or exciting, often in a possibly romantic or even sexual way. That’s the meaning of “titillating.”

Liz says, “Well, my memoir will certainly have lots  of stories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encou ntered in this industry.” Liz is talking about her memoir having a lot of stories ab out her career. Your “career” is roughly your work life. We suspect that Liz is prob ably an actress or perhaps a singer, someone who’s famous.

She is going to talk about the people she’s worked with and the kindness she’s encountered, or she has been met with, in this indu stry. “Industry” (industry) usually refers to a group of companies, all of whom  make the same kinds of products or provide the same kinds of services. We could talk about the “automobile industry” – the group of companies that  make automobiles. We could

talk about the “entertainment industry” – all of the companies that make movies and television shows and records and so forth.

Here in Los Angeles, when someone says “the industr y,” they are referring to the entertainment industry, because the entertainment i ndustry is so important here in Los Angeles, nobody even calls it the “entertain ment industry” or the “movie industry.” They just say “the industry.” And when y ou say that to someone in Los Angeles, they know you’re talking about the enterta inment industry. Liz doesn’t say what industry she’s talking about, but we can g uess that it’s probably “the industry” in the Los Angeles sense of that term.

Oscar says, “That’s nice, but people buy autobiogra phical books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.” “Autobiog raphical” refers to your own life, things that you have written about yourself. Most p eople don’t think about publishing autobiographies until they are older, al though there are some celebrities and politicians who have published memo irs or autobiographies in their 20s and 30s and 40s, apparently believing tha t their lives are so interesting that everyone wants to know about them. Maybe I sho uld publish my memoir, my autobiography. I’ll have to think about that. I don ’t think my life is very interesting, unfortunately. I could always invent some things – make some things up.

Anyway, Oscar is saying that people buy these memoi rs, these autobiographical books, “for the juicy details.” “Juicy” (juicy) her e means interesting, but also shocking. Oscar says that these details should be s alacious, “the more salacious, the better,” he says, meaning the more salacious the details, the better the book will be. “Salacious” (salacious), like titillating,  also refers to things that are shocking, exciting, or scandalous, but related spec ifically to something sexual.

Liz says, “I was really thinking of focusing on the  people who helped me in my career and their selflessness.” “Selflessness” (sel flessness) refers to putting other people’s needs and desires before your own. “ Selflessness” is the opposite of a more common phenomenon and word, “selfishness”  (selfishness). “To be selfish” means to only be thinking about yourself. “To be selfless” means to be thinking about other people and not yourself.

Oscar says, “But I thought you were interested in w riting a tell-all book.” A “tell-all book” is a book that gives people the details of on e’s life, including secrets that no one has ever heard before. Oscar says, “Consider ing how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must h ave lots of steamy stories.” Oscar is referring to Liz’s past. Apparently, she h as been married more than once and has had “affairs” (affairs).

The word “affairs” has a couple of different meanin gs, but here it means having a romantic relationship with someone to whom you are not married. You’re married to one person, but you’re having a romantic relatio nship with another person. That’s called “having an affair.” Oscars thinks tha t Liz has a lot of “steamy” (steamy) stories to tell. “Steamy” is similar to “s alacious,” that we discussed earlier.

Liz says, “I don’t want to be telling tales about p eople I love or once loved.” “To tell tales” means to tell stories, especially stori es that are not completely true. Liz says, “I want to focus on the positive” – the good things that have happened in her life. Oscar says, “You could do that, but your books won’t fly off the shelves without those juicy details.” “To fly off the shelv es” (shelves) means to sell very quickly. “Shelves” is the plural of “shelf” (shelf) , which is a place where you will find goods in the store to buy.

If you go into a grocery store, for example, there are lots of different shelves, usually three or four shelves in one area, and you have different types of food on each shelf. “To fly off the shelves” means to sell quickly, as if the goods that you are selling are somehow flying up into the air, the y’re being purchased so quickly. Liz says, “Really?” She’s surprised at what Oscar is telling her. Oscars says, “Really.”

Liz then says, “Maybe I could tell one or two scand alous stories.” “Scandalous” (scandalous) is very shocking in a bad sort of way.  Realizing her book will not sell very well unless she tells some scandalous sto ries, Liz agrees to do so. Oscar is happy. He says, “Now you’re talking.” That  expression, “now you’re talking,” is used when you are agreeing with what the other person is saying. You’re telling the other person, “Yes, that’s exact ly the kind of thing I want to hear.”

Liz says, “There was that infamous party where a ca tfight broke out between . . .” – and then the dialogue ends. “Infamous” (infamous)  is famous in a bad way. You can be famous for doing something good. You can  be “infamous” for doing something bad. Strangely, however, in recent years,  people have started to use “infamous” to mean the same as “famous,” even thoug h the traditional definition is being famous for doing something wrong, for doing something bad. You do not want to be infamous.

A “catfight” is a fight between two or more women. Why are they cats and not dogs? I’m not sure, but that’s the term we use when  referring to a physical fight between two or more women. You can’t say “dogfight”  for a fight between two or more men, however. It doesn’t work that way. In fac t, the word “dogfight” means

a fight between two airplanes up in the air fightin g each other, as in a war. That’s a dogfight.

Then, of course, there’s a “bullfight” that you mig ht see in Spain or Mexico, where they actually kill a bull. But we’re not talking ab out killing anyone here. We’re just talking about fighting, and that’s what Liz may tel l about in her memoir.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oscar: We’re thrilled that you’ll be publishing you r memoir with our company. You’ve had such an interesting life. I’m sure you’l l have lots of titillating stories to tell.

Liz: Well, my memoir will certainly have a lot of s tories about my career: the people I’ve worked with and the kindness I’ve encou ntered in this industry.

Oscar: That’s nice, but people buy autobiographical  books for the juicy details, the more salacious, the better.

Liz: I was really thinking of focusing on the peopl e who helped me in my career and their selflessness.

Oscar: But I thought you were interested in writing  a tell-all book. Considering how many times you’ve been married and the affairs you’ve had, you must have lots of steamy stories.

Liz: I don’t want to be telling tales about people I love or once loved. I want to focus on the positive.

Liz: Maybe I could tell one or two scandalous stori es.

Oscar: Now you’re talking.

# Meeting a New Neighbor

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 998 – Meeting a New Neighbor.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 998. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Nancy and Eric a bout meeting a new neighbor. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Hello there! Hello!

Eric: Hello.

Nancy: I’m Nancy, your neighbor across the street. You’re new to the neighborhood.

Eric: Yes, I just moved in last weekend.

Nancy: That’s nice. How are you settling in?

Eric: Fine, thanks.

Nancy: Would you like to come over and have a cup of coffee? I can give you the scoop on the neighborhood and give you some tips on  places to go and things to do in this area.

Eric: Thanks, but I’m kind of busy right now. I’ll take a rain check.

Nancy: No problem. Stop by anytime. We have quite a  few social events in the area that you might be interested in.

Eric: I’m not much of a joiner. I tend to keep to m yself.

Nancy: Oh, but we couldn’t let you do that. I’m app ointing myself your new social secretary. As a new resident in a small town, you s hould know that everyone will want to meet you. You’ll be inundated with invitati ons. I can help you sort them out.

Eric: I appreciate your offer, but if I have to fen d off neighbors, I’ll do it myself.

Nancy: Well, suit yourself. I don’t recommend turni ng down too many invitations, or you’ll get a reputation for being a recluse.

Eric: That’s okay with me. I’d rather not be the subject of talk among the busybodies.

Nancy: Busybodies! Well, some people!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Nancy saying to Eric, “Hel lo there! Hello!” “Hello there” is just an informal way of saying hello. We usually  use that when we don’t see someone, and then suddenly we see them, and we’re i ndicating that we can see them. Eric says, “Hello.” Nancy says, “I’m Nancy, y our neighbor across the street.” Your “neighbor” is the person who lives ei ther right next to you or very close to you.

Nancy says, “You’re new to the neighborhood,” meani ng you have not been in this area before. Eric says, “Yes, I just moved in last weekend.” “To move in” means to move to a new location. You can “move in” or you can “move out.” Nancy says, “That’s nice. How are you settling in?”  “To settle (settle) in” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to begin to feel comforta ble in a new place, to begin to feel like this new place is now familiar to you.  Eric says, “Fine, thanks.” He’s settling in just fine.

Nancy then asks, “Would you like to come over and h ave a cup of coffee?” “To come over” is a phrasal verb meaning to come to my house or to come to where I am. Nancy says, “I can give you the scoop on the ne ighborhood and give you some tips on places to go and things to do in this area.” The “scoop” (scoop) refers to information, what we might call “inside i nformation” – information that is not available to everyone.

If someone says, “I want to give you the scoop on o ur new boss,” he’s saying, “I want to give you information about our new boss tha t nobody else knows” (or that perhaps few people know). Nancy invites Eric over to give him “the scoop on the

neighborhood.” Notice the preposition “on” comes af ter “scoop.” If you’re going to give someone the scoop, you’re going to give them the scoop “on” something, or “on” someone. So, the preposition “on” almost alway s follows “scoop.”

Eric says, “Thanks, but I’m kind of busy right now. ” “I’m kind of busy” means “I’m somewhat busy.” “I’ll take a rain check,” he says. “To take a rain (rain) check” is to say, “I can’t do that right now, but I will do it in the future.” When someone offers you something and you can’t do it immediatel y, you might say, “I’ll take a rain check,” meaning not now, but maybe later – may be at a different time, at a later time.

Nancy says, “No problem,” meaning that’s okay. “Sto p by anytime.” “To stop by” (by) means to stop at someone’s house or where some one is. You can stop by any place, really. “I’m going to the grocery store,  and on my way there – before I go there – I’m going to stop by at the gas station and fill up my car with gas.” That’s also another way of using “stop by.” Here, N ancy is using “stop by” to mean come over to my house whenever you want.

She says, “We have quite a few social events in the  area that you might be interested in.” A “social event” would be like a pa rty or anything where a group of people get together and have a good time. Eric says , however, “I’m not much of a joiner.” The word “joiner” (joiner) refers to a p erson who likes to participate in group activities, who likes to join groups to do th ings.

Eric says he is “not much of a joiner,” meaning he doesn’t like to join groups and spend time with other people, I guess. He says, “I tend to keep to myself.” “To keep to yourself” means to be a private person, a p erson who doesn’t like talking about himself or giving information about himself. Nancy says, “Oh, but we couldn’t let you do that. I’m appointing myself you r new social secretary.”

Nancy is telling Eric that she won’t let him keep to himself, basically. She is going to appoint herself his new social secretary. “To ap point yourself” is to say, “I am going to do this particular job or this particular role, even though no one has asked me to do it.” That is “appointing yourself.” We often use this in a joking way – when someone says, “I’m going to appoint myself the king of this house, and everyone must do what I say.” I tried that. It does n’t work so well with the queen of my house.

Anyway, Nancy has appointed herself the “new social  secretary.” A “social secretary” is a person whose job it is to manage so meone’s social appointments – where they go to lunch, the parties they attend, and so forth. Normally, only a very rich or important person would have a social s ecretary, someone who would

handle things that were not related to the person’s  business life, but to his or her personal life.

Nancy continues, “As a new resident in a small town , you should know that everyone will want to meet you.” A “resident” is a person who lives in a particular area. I’m a resident of California. When I lived in  Minnesota, I was a resident of Minnesota. Nancy is saying that because Eric is new  to the area, other people will want to meet him. She says, “You’ll be inundat ed with invitations.” “To be inundated” (inundated) means to be flooded by, or to have a lot of, something – too much of something.

“I am inundated with emails every morning.” That me ans lots of people email me, too many people – I can’t possibly respond to all of them. That’s “to be inundated.” Nancy is saying Eric will be inundated with invitations from other people in this small town where he has moved to. Sh e says, “I can help you sort them out.” “To sort something out” is a phrasal ver b meaning to look at a large amount of something – a large amount of information , for example – and decide how to categorize it, how to organize it. That’s wh at Nancy is suggesting she do for Eric.

Eric says, “I appreciate your offer, but if I have to fend off neighbors, I’ll do it myself.” “To fend (fend) off” is a phrasal verb mea ning to protect or defend yourself against someone or something, especially i f someone is attacking you. Eric, of course, doesn’t think his neighbors are go ing to attack him. He’s sort of making a joke, saying if he gets a lot of people wh o want to contact him, he’ll be able to take care of it himself. He will be able “t o fend off neighbors” by himself.

Nancy says, “Well, suit yourself.” That expression “suit (suit) yourself” means if that’s the way you want to do it, then go ahead. It ’s usually said when someone offers help to another person, and the other person  rejects it. The other person says no, and the person who offered their help feel s a little offended or a little upset that the other person didn’t accept his help.  So, that’s probably why Nancy is saying “suit yourself.”

She’s saying, “Well, I tried to help you, but you s ay you want to do it a different way, so that’s okay. Fine.” But she’s also saying t hat that’s probably not a good decision. In a way, it’s a criticism of Eric. She’s  saying, by this little expression “suit yourself,” that you are making the wrong deci sion, and you will probably have negative consequences because of it. That’s a lot to say in two words, but that is in fact what Nancy is saying here. I think.

She says, “I don’t recommend turning down too many invitations, or you’ll get a reputation for being a recluse.” “To turn down an i nvitation” is to say no to something, to reject something. “Reputation” (reput ation) is how other people perceive you, how other people see you, the opinion s of other people have of you. Nancy is saying that if Eric turns down a lot of invitations from his neighbors, he’ll get a reputation for being a “recluse” (reclu se). A recluse is a person who spends most of his or her time alone without talkin g to other people.

Eric says, however, “That’s okay with me. I’d rathe r not be the subject of talk among the busybodies.” A “busybody” (busybody) is s omeone who gossips about other people, someone who wants to know what’ s going on in other people’s lives even though it isn’t any of his or h er business. You have no reason to know what is happening with your neighbor’s marr iage. If you try to find out, you’re probably being a busybody. You’re trying to get information about the private lives of other people that you have no righ t to know and shouldn’t be interested in.

However, sometimes it’s very interesting what’s hap pening with our neighbors, but we should not be busybodies. Nancy is insulted by this term because it is an insulting term. If you say to someone, “You’re a bu sybody,” that’s an insulting term. That’s a criticism of that person. Nancy says , “Busybodies! Well, some people!” That expression “Some people!” is used to show how you are shocked by what someone has said or what someone has done. You can’t believe it. And that’s what Nancy is saying here.

She is shocked that Eric would basically insult her  when she thought she was just trying to be nice to Eric. I have to say, I th ink Eric is being a little cruel here. Nancy might be a busybody, but it’s probably not a good idea to insult your neighbors the first time you meet them, unless your  neighbor is a cat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nancy: Hello there! Hello!

Eric: Hello.

Nancy: I’m Nancy, your neighbor across the street. You’re new to the neighborhood.

Eric: Yes, I just moved in last weekend.

 Nancy: That’s nice. How are you settling in?

Eric: Fine, thanks.

Nancy: Would you like to come over and have a cup of coffee? I can give you the scoop on the neighborhood and give you some tips on  places to go and things to do in this area.

Eric: Thanks, but I’m kind of busy right now. I’ll take a rain check.

Nancy: No problem. Stop by anytime. We have quite a  few social events in the area that you might be interested in.

Eric: I’m not much of a joiner. I tend to keep to m yself.

Nancy: Oh, but we couldn’t let you do that. I’m app ointing myself your new social secretary. As a new resident in a small town, you s hould know that everyone will want to meet you. You’ll be inundated with invitati ons. I can help you sort them out.

Eric: I appreciate your offer, but if I have to fen d off neighbors, I’ll do it myself.

Nancy: Well, suit yourself. I don’t recommend turni ng down too many invitations or you’ll get a reputation for being a recluse.

Eric: That’s okay with me. I’d rather not be the subject of talk among the busybodies.

Nancy: Busybodies! Well, some people!

# Being Vague and Unfocused

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 999 – Being Vague and Unfocused.

Going to party like it’s episode 999.

Oh, hi. Welcome to English as a Second Language Pod cast episode 999. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

I’m happy today. This is episode 999. You can visit  our website at ESLPod.com. On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Thierry and Bonnie about being vague and unfocused. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Thierry: I’m pumped and ready to help paint the com munity center this weekend. What time are we supposed to get there in the morni ng?

Bonnie: I’m not sure. Sophia was a little vague abo ut that. She told people to show up when they can make it.

Thierry: That doesn’t sound like an auspicious star t. How many people are supposed to be there?

Bonnie: I’m a little fuzzy on that, too. Sophia did n’t have a sign-up sheet. She just told people to show up if they could.

Thierry: I hate to say it, but Sophia is the worst person to be organizing this. Her heart is in the right place, but her head is in the  clouds. I don’t think I’ve ever met a more absentminded person.

Bonnie: I know what you mean. She always seems to b e daydreaming.

Thierry: I’m going to call her right now and pin he r down. She needs to attend to the nitty-gritty if this is project is going to get  done.

Bonnie: What if she’s as vague as she usually is?

Thierry: I’ll try speaking to her on a different fr equency: Earth to Sophia, Earth to Sophia . . .

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Thierry saying, “I’m pumpe d and ready to help paint the community center this weekend.” “To be pumped” (pum ped) means to be very excited, to be prepared and eager to do something, to do something with a lot of in enthusiasm. That’s what Thierry is saying here. He’s pumped to paint the community center this weekend. A “community center”  would be a building that is used by people in a certain neighborhood, a certain  part of town, for meetings and classes and things of that nature. Community ce nters are usually built by the local government.

He says, “What time are we supposed to get there in  the morning?” Bonnie says, “I’m not sure. Sophia was a little vague about that .” To be vague” (vague) means to be unclear, not very specific. Bonnie says that Sophia was “a little vague” – somewhat vague – about what time they should get to  the community center in the morning to paint. Bonnie says, “She told people  to show up when they can make it.” “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to appear, to come, to be present at some event or at some location.

Normally, you show up for work at eight o’clock in the morning or maybe nine o’clock in the morning. That’s one possible use of “to show up.” Often it’s used to mean to attend: “How many people showed up at the m eeting last night?” How many people attended? How many people went to the m eeting? Bonnie says that Sophia said that people should “show up when they can make it.” “To make it” here means to be able to do something, especially to be able to go somewhere for some purpose. I wanted to go to the movie last night, but it was raining and I didn’t make it. I didn’t actually go.

Thierry says, “That doesn’t sound like an auspiciou s start.” “Auspicious” (auspicious) means favorable, indicating that somet hing good will happen. It’s not a common word in English conversation, but you will  read it. You will sometimes also hear people say “auspicious” when talking abou t something that indicates that this event is going to go well, or in this cas e, that this event is not going to go well. Thierry says this doesn’t – this does not – s ound like an auspicious start.

“How many people are supposed to be there?” He asks . Bonnie says, “I’m a little fuzzy on that too.” “To be fuzzy” (fuzzy) here mean s to be vague, to be unclear, not to be very specific. Bonnie says, “Sophia didn’ t have a sign-up sheet.” The word “sheet” (sheet) here means a sheet of paper, a  piece of paper. A “sign-up sheet” is a piece of paper where you put your name down to indicate that you are going to participate in something or you are going to do something. A sign-up

sheet would be used for some event for which you wa nt to know who is coming or how many people are coming.

Thierry says, “I hate to say it, but Sophia is the worst person to be organizing this. Her heart is in the right place, but her head  is in the clouds.” There are two common expressions there. First, “to have your hear t (heart) in the right place.” “To have your heart in the right place” means that you have good intentions. You want to do the right thing. You want to do good.

“To have your head in the clouds” means that you’re  not a very practical person. You’re not a person who worries about the details, about the specifics, of something. In other words, you’re not a very good p erson to plan or organize something, because you’re not paying attention to the specific details that you need to pay attention to. Sophia, then, wants to do  the right thing, but she’s not a very practical person. “Her heart is in the right p lace, but her head is in the clouds.”

Thierry says, “I don’t think I’ve ever met a more a bsentminded person.” “To be absentminded” (absentminded) – one word – means to be forgetful, to be unable to concentrate or focus. There’s an old expression,  “the absentminded professor,” referring to someone who teaches at the  university. We think of professors as being absentminded because although they are very smart – they have a lot of intelligence – they are often not ver y practical. So, we have this image of the absentminded professor.

Sophia is also considered to be absentminded by Thi erry. Bonnie says, “I know what you mean. She always seems to be daydreaming.”  “To daydream” is to imagine things that aren’t actually happening right  now, and may never happen, during the middle of the day. Normally, we think ab out dreaming as something that you do at night when you’re sleeping. “Daydrea ming” is to be imagining things happening right now, instead of, of course, actually doing your work.

If you are sitting at your desk in your office at w ork and daydreaming, your boss will not be very happy. You’re supposed to be worki ng, not dreaming about your vacation next year in Hawaii or in France or wherev er you take your vacation. You daydream about pleasant things, things that you  want to happen or that might happen.

Thierry says, “I’m going to call her right now and pin her down.” “To pin (pin) someone down” is a phrasal verb meaning to make the m give you a specific answer to your question, to make them give you the details of something, especially when that person has been vague about the issue that you are asking

about. Thierry says “She,” meaning Sophia, “needs to attend to the nitty-gritty if this project is going to get done.”

“To attend (attend) to” something means to pay atte ntion to something, to address something, to take care of something. Notic e that you use this expression with the preposition “to” at the end. It ’s always something you are attending to. This is different than the verb “to a ttend,” which can mean something similar as “to attend to,” but it could a lso mean “to show up” – to go to a certain place. Here in this sentence, it means to  take care of or pay attention to something.

Thierry wants Sophia “to attend to the nitty-gritty .” “Nitty (nitty) – gritty (gritty)” refers to the specific details. Sophia hasn’t atten ded to the nitty-gritty here. She hasn’t told people exactly what time they should be  there or found out even how many people are going. Bonnie says, “What if she’s as vague as she usually is?” What if, in other words, she doesn’t give Thierry the details he’s looking for? Thierry says, “I’ll try speaking to her on a differ ent frequency: Earth to Sophia, Earth to Sophia . . .”

Thierry’s making a joke here. The word “frequency” is normally used to talk about measuring radio waves. Here, really it refers more to a particular channel for audio or radio communication. In order for two peop le to talk to each other on the radio, they both have to be on the same frequency, on the same channel – and that, in fact, is another common expression in Engl ish: “to be on the same frequency.”

We even say “to be on the same wavelength” when we are talking about someone who is thinking the same way we are, someon e to whom we can communicate our ideas easily. “Wavelength” is anoth er term you will hear people use in talking about radio communication. When Thie rry says he is going to try to speak to Sophia “on a different frequency,” he mean s he’s going to try to reach her – to communicate with her – because she doesn’t  seem to understand normal human communication.

Then he uses the expression “Earth to Sophia.” When  you say, “Earth to” someone, you are trying to get their attention, but  the idea is that this person isn’t paying attention. It’s almost as if this person wer e from another planet and you, being on planet Earth, are trying to communicate to  this person. Perhaps this expression became popular during the era of space e xploration in the twentieth century, I’m not sure. But it means that you are tr ying to communicate with someone who seems to not be listening or not be pay ing attention to what you are talking about.

 It’s a somewhat insulting way to talk to someone. I f you feel as though someone isn’t listening to you or isn’t paying attention to  you, you might use this expression as a joke to get the person to pay atten tion. We may also use this expression when someone has an idea that is complet ely unrealistic or very incorrect, very wrong. The person doesn’t seem to b e thinking rationally. Someone says, “I’m going to walk from New York City  to Paris.” Well, you might use the expression here, “Earth to Jeff, you can’t walk from New York to Paris” – at least not very easily.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Thierry: I’m pumped and ready to help paint the com munity center this weekend. What time are we supposed to get there in the morni ng?

Bonnie: I’m not sure. Sophia was a little vague abo ut that. She told people to show up when they can make it.

Thierry: That doesn’t sound like an auspicious star t. How many people are supposed to be there?

Bonnie: I’m a little fuzzy on that, too. Sophia did n’t have a sign-up sheet. She just told people to show up if they could.

Thierry: I hate to say it, but Sophia is the worst person to be organizing this. Her heart is in the right place, but her head is in the  clouds. I don’t think I’ve ever met a more absentminded person.

Bonnie: I know what you mean. She always seems to b e daydreaming.

Thierry: I’m going to call her right now and pin he r down. She needs to attend to the nitty-gritty if this is project is going to get  done.

Bonnie: What if she’s as vague as she usually is?

Thierry: I’ll try speaking to her on a different fr equency: Earth to Sophia, Earth to Sophia . . .

# Reaching a Milestone

Welcome to English as Second Language Podcast numbe r 1,000 – Reaching a Milestone.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,000. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. I thought we’d do someth ing a little special in the introduction to this one-thousandth episode. This is a dialogue between Jeff and Lucy about reaching a milestone. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: Well, we’ve reached a milestone.

Lucy: Yup, it’s been a long haul, but we’ve finally  made it. Did you ever think we’d get here?

Jeff: I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out. I thought that our prospects  were iffy, at best.

Lucy: Me, too. We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turning point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in  and day out.

Jeff: So, what should we do now?

Lucy: I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our achievements . . . so far.

Jeff: That sounds good. Then what?

Lucy: Put our noses back to the grindstone?

Jeff: I was afraid you were going to say that!

[end of dialogue]

We begin this episode with Jeff – that’s me – sayin g to Lucy, “Well, we’ve reached a milestone.” A “milestone” (milestone) is some significant event or achievement that indicates that you are making prog ress towards some goal. We

often use this term in business nowadays, when talk ing about project management or project planning.

When you have a big project, there are many things you have to do, many things you have to accomplish. Typically, you will divide up the different things you need to do and put them on a schedule so that, for examp le, by next Friday you will have completed this task, and by the Friday after t hat you will have completed that task, and so forth. These are milestones that you are setting up, that you are establishing, that you want to reach by a certain d ate or day.

I begin the dialogue by saying that “we have reache d a milestone.” Lucy says, “Yup.” That’s an informal way of saying “yes” or “y eah.” “Yup (yup), it’s been a long haul but we’ve finally made it.” A “long haul”  (haul) is a long and difficult or challenging period of time that you have to go thro ugh in order to reach your goal, to reach your objective, or in this case, to reach your milestone of 1,000 episodes, of course.

Lucy says, “It’s been a long haul” – it’s been a di fficult journey, it’s been a long journey – but we have “made it,” she says. “We’ve f inally made it.” “To make it” means to achieve your goal, to accomplish what you wanted to accomplish, to reach the milestone in your project as you are maki ng progress towards the final goal or objective.

Lucy says, “Did you ever think we’d get here?” She’ s asking me if I ever thought we would get to this particular milestone, and I sa y, quite honestly, “I admit I had my doubts.” When we say “I admit,” we’re saying tha t what we are about to say is something that we may not have wanted to say or per haps are embarrassed to say. Here, it perhaps means “to be really honest wi th you.”

I say, “I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out.” “To be dubious” (dubious) m eans to be full of doubts, to be uncertain – not to be sure if something is going  to happen or if something is true. I say, “I was really dubious that this ventur e would pan out.” A “venture” (venture) is an effort to do something that is chal lenging or difficult, especially as it relates to a business, for example, or an organi zation.

If someone talks about starting a new venture, they ’re talking about starting a new organization or, more commonly, a new business.  We have the expression “venture capitalists.” A “venture capitalist” is so meone who goes out and invests in, gives money to, new businesses in the hope that  the business will be successful and that venture capitalist will get his  or her money back – plus a profit, of course.

 I say I was “dubious that this venture would pan ou t.” “To pan (pan) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to be successful, especia lly in making something financially successful, or in some other way succes sful. You could also talk about your relationship “not panning out.” “I went out on  a date with this girl, but it didn’t pan out.” She didn’t like me. She had another boyfr iend. You know, the usual excuses.

I say, “I thought that our prospects were iffy at b est.” Your “prospects” (prospects) are the chances that you are going to d o well. It’s the likelihood of future success. In sports, we sometimes talk about “prospects” to refer to young baseball players who are very talented and who we t hink will be successful in the future. You could also talk about your prospects for employment, for getting a job. If someone graduates with a degree in, I don’t  know, ancient history, that person might not have very good prospects for the f uture. That’s me, by the way. I graduated with a degree in ancient history many y ears ago – not 2,000 years ago, but many years ago.

I say that “I thought our prospects were iffy, at b est.” “Iffy” (iffy) means doubtful, not certain. It’s somewhat of an informal term that  we would use when we are not sure something is going to happen, when we are doub tful something will happen. We might say, “I want to try this new restaurant, b ut it’s a bit iffy,” or “It seems a little iffy.” We mean it could be very good, or it could be very bad. We’re not sure.

“At best” means at the most. When I say, “Our prosp ects were iffy, at best,” I mean that they were, at most, doubtful – meaning th ey were very doubtful. The best-case scenario – the best possible outcome or s ituation – was in this case “iffy.” You might say, for example, “We’ll probably  make $200 today at best.” “At best” there means the maximum amount, the most that  we will make.

Lucy says, “Me, too.” She agrees our prospects were  iffy at best. She says, “We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turni ng point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in and day out.” When yo u say you have an “auspicious (auspicious) start” to something, you m ean you have a good beginning, a favorable beginning – a beginning that  indicates that things will turn out well. However, in our case, Lucy says we did no t have an auspicious start, “but we had a turning point.”

A “turning point” is some event or situation that c auses you suddenly to become very successful or not very successful. In general,  it means that you have some event that causes things to change significantly fr om the way they were going before that event. If your girlfriend says, “We’ve reached a turning point in our

relationship,” she means either things are going to  get much better or they’re going to get much worse. (I don’t know. It depends on your girlfriend.)

The “turning point” would be a sudden change or sig nificant change – something important that will affect the way things are going  – or rather, the way things will go in the future. We had a turning point in this ve nture after a few months of “grinding out the work.” “To grind (grind) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to continue to do something, especially if it perhaps isn’t very interesting, or if it requires a lot of work, or possibly both.

“To grind out” something means to work hard and get  it done, even if it isn’t always the most pleasant or pleasurable thing to do . That’s not true with our podcast, of course. But in the script, Lucy says th at we had a turning point “after a few months of grinding out the work, day in and d ay out.”

That expression “day in and day (day) out” means da y after day. It’s a phrase that we use to emphasize that something happens eve ry day without rest. “Day in and day out, you get up in the morning, and you eat breakfast, and you go to work, and you come home, and you read a book or wat ch television, and you eat your dinner, and you go to bed.” That happens “day in and day out” for many people.

Jeff – that’s me again – says, “What should we do n ow?” Lucy says, “I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our ac hievements so far.” “Celebratory” comes from the verb “to celebrate” (c elebrate). “To celebrate” means to do something to mark or to remember some s ignificant event or situation. We celebrate our birthdays – we have a p arty or we go out to dinner. That’s “to celebrate.” You do something that makes you happy, something that will make you remember how good this event or this situation is.

Lucy is proposing we have a “celebratory drink.” No rmally when you use the word “drink” in American English, you’re talking ab out an alcoholic drink such as beer or wine or whiskey or rum. I like rum, persona lly. That’s my favorite alcohol, but I don’t drink alcohol very much anymore – hardl y ever, really. But if I did, I would drink rum.

Anyway, back to the story, we’re having a celebrato ry drink, Lucy says, “a toast to our achievements.” A “toast” (toast) here refers  to words that you say, usually while raising a glass of some alcohol or some alcoh olic drink in your hand, in order to honor or to celebrate or to remember some particular person or event. When you get married in the United States, it’s com mon for one of the members

of your, what we would call “wedding party” – the g roup of people who are part of the wedding celebration – to make a toast.

“To make a toast” means to stand up and say, “Here’ s to the new bride and groom” – here’s to the newly married couple. They’r e saluting, they’re toasting, they’re celebrating these people. Sometimes a toast  is just one or two words. In English we would say, for example, “Cheers!” In oth er languages, there are other common words that are used when someone picks up th eir glass of alcohol and makes a toast.

I say, “That sounds good” – the drink sounds good, that is. Then I say, “Then what?” – then what do we do? Lucy says, “Put our no ses back to the grindstone?” “To put your nose (nose) back to the g rindstone (grindstone)” means to go back to your hard work, your difficult work, after taking a short break.

So, if you work eight hours every day, you might ta ke a break for 10 or 15 minutes in the morning. After your break, you may s ay, “Well, now I have to put my nose back to the grindstone.” I have to continue  working hard at what I was working on before I took my break.

Jeff says, “I was afraid you were going to say that .” That expression, “I was afraid you were going to say that,” is used when we knew the other person was going to say that, but we didn’t really want them to say that – perhaps because, in this case, I don’t want to put my nose back to the grind stone. But I must.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jeff: Well, we’ve reached a milestone.

Lucy: Yup, it’s been a long haul, but we’ve finally  made it. Did you ever think we’d get here?

Jeff: I admit I had my doubts. At the beginning, I was really dubious that this venture would pan out. I thought that our prospects  were iffy, at best.

Lucy: Me, too. We didn’t have an auspicious start, but we had a turning point after a few months of grinding out the work, day in  and day out.

Jeff: So, what should we do now?

 Lucy: I think we both deserve a celebratory drink, a toast to our achievements . . . so far.

Jeff: That sounds good. Then what?

Lucy: Put our noses back to the grindstone?

Jeff: I was afraid you were going to say that!

# Practicing Yoga

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 1,001 – Practicing Yoga.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,001. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue between Victor and Rosaria about something I don’t know very much about and have never done, but I’m happy to talk about, and t hat is practicing yoga. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: Humph!

Rosaria: What’s the matter?

Victor: I just got back from my first yoga class an d I was sorely disappointed.

Rosaria: I’ve heard that yoga is very good low-impa ct exercise and helps with stress relief. It’s supposed to calm the mind and s trengthen the body.

Victor: Yeah, right.

Rosaria: It sounds like you had a bad experience. D id you have a bad teacher?

Victor: The teacher was fine. I learned about mantr as and chakras, I learned breathing techniques, and I tried a few basic poses .

Rosaria: That all sounds right from my own experien ce, such as it is. But, there are a lot of different types of yoga. Maybe you nee d to try a different kind.

Victor: The problem wasn’t the kind of yoga being p racticed. It was the class.

Rosaria: Were the mats uncomfortable?

Victor: No.

Rosaria: Was it too cramped?

Victor: No.

Rosaria: Then what was the problem?

Victor: There was too much testosterone in the room .

Rosaria: You mean you were in a class with just men ?

Victor: Yeah.

Rosaria: And that was a problem?

Victor: Do you think I would be taking a yoga class  if I weren’t trying to meet women?!

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is about “yoga” (yoga), which has bee n very popular in the United States over the last 25 years or so. It is especial ly popular here in Los Angeles, or at least it used to be. Yoga is something differ ent to different people. When most people in the U.S. talk about yoga, they’re re ally talking about the program of exercise that you do, usually following some sor t of leader in a class.

There are lots of places here in Los Angeles where you can go to a yoga class, and you do certain exercises for your physical heal th – and some say also for your mental health and relaxation. Our dialogue beg ins with Victor sounding disappointed. He says, “Humph!” Rosaria says, “What ’s the matter?” He says, “I just got back from” – I just returned from – “my fi rst yoga class, and I was sorely disappointed.” The word “sorely” (sorely) means ver y much, or greatly. Victor was really disappointed.

Rosaria says, “I’ve heard that yoga is very good lo w-impact exercise.” “Low- impact (impact) exercise” is exercise that doesn’t require a lot of hard, sudden movements with your body. You’re getting exercise, but it isn’t going to hurt your knees or your legs or some other part of your body.  Rosaria says that she heard that yoga “helps with stress relief.” “Stress” (str ess) is anxiety, tension. A “stressful situation” is a situation in which you h ave or experience this tension and/or anxiety, which can affect your body as well as your mind.

Rosaria uses the term “stress relief” (relief). If you get “relief” from something, you no longer suffer from that thing. We usually us e the word “relief” when we’re talking about someone who is ill or sick and needs to feel better or wants to get better. You may give that person some drugs to give  them relief from the pain, for example. In fact, we call those kinds of drugs “pai n relievers,” similar to “relief.”

Rosaria says that she heard that “yoga is supposed to calm the mind and strengthen the body.” “To calm (calm) the mind” mea ns to make you stop worrying about things, to stop you from having thes e stressful thoughts so that you are more relaxed. “To strengthen (strengthen) the body” means to make the body stronger – to perhaps exercise your muscles in  such a way that you are physically stronger.

Victor, however, doesn’t seem to agree. He says, “Y eah, right.” When we use that expression, “Yeah, right,” with that sort of i ntonation, that sort of tone, we are indicating that we don’t agree. It’s very confusing , because normally if someone says, “Right,” they mean “Correct,” or “I agree.” B ut if you say it in this way – “Yeah, right” – that means that you don’t agree. Yo u think that is wrong.

Rosaria says, “It sounds like you had a bad experie nce. Did you have a bad teacher?” Victor says, “The teacher was fine” – the  teacher was okay. Remember I mentioned that in most yoga classes there’s someo ne who’s leading the class, just like any class, and we call that person the “t eacher.” Victor says, “I learned about mantas and chakras, I learned breathing techn iques, and I tried a few basic poses.”

A “mantra” (mantra) is a sound, a word, or a phrase  that is used often for people who are meditating or perhaps praying. It’s a word that’s often associated with yoga, although there are some other traditions, oth er practices, of meditation and prayer that use that same term outside of the “worl d of yoga,” we could say. A mantra is typically a word or a sound that is used to help you relax or to meditate.

A “chakra” (chakra) is apparently one of several ce nters of what is called “spiritual thought” or energy in the body. Not exac tly sure what all that means, but that’s the definition anyway, and it is something t hat is important in the practice of yoga. Victor says, “I learned breathing techniques. ” A “technique” (technique) is a way of doing something, a method for doing somethin g. “Breathing techniques,” then, would be techniques to help you breathe – pro bably in such a way that would allow you to relax – or to do some sort of ex ercise without, we would use the term, “getting winded.”

Singers and musicians often use breathing technique s to help them perform, to help them do what they want to do. In yoga, breathi ng techniques might be used as a form of relaxation – techniques to help you re lax. Victor also says he “tried a few basic poses.” A “pose” (pose) is a position, an d yoga has different positions that you put your body into as part of the practice  of yoga.

Rosaria says, “That all sounds right from my own ex perience, such as it is.” That phrase “such as it is” is used to indicate that you  don’t have very much experience in this area, for example. It could also  be used to indicate that you realize what you just said may not be very useful o r valuable to the person you’re talking to. It’s similar to another expression, “fo r what it’s worth.”

If you’re giving someone advice about something tha t you don’t know very much about (for me, for example, yoga) you would probabl y use a phrase such as this – “for what it’s worth” or “such as it is” – to ind icate that you really don’t know what you’re talking about, which is typical for me.  Rosaria says, “That all sounds right from my own experience, such as it is, but there are a lot of different types of yoga. Maybe you need to try a different kind” – a different kind of yoga.

Victor says, “The problem wasn’t the kind of yoga b eing practiced. It was the class.” The word “practice” here means participate or engage in something. So, Victor wasn’t concerned about the kind of yoga. He says, “The problem was the class.” Rosaria says, “Were the mats uncomfortable? ” A “mat” (mat) here means a soft piece of material, usually rectangular in sh ape, that you put on the floor so you can do your exercises without touching the floo r directly and without hurting yourself on the floor if the floor is hard.

In yoga it’s very common, I’m told, to use mats in the class. So, when you see people going to yoga classes here in Los Angeles, they’ll often be carrying a little mat. Victor says the mats were not uncomfortable. R osaria says, “Was it” – meaning the class – “too cramped?” “Cramped” (cramp ed) here means crowded, when you have too many people in too small of a spa ce. Victor says, “No.” Rosaria says, “Then what was the problem?” Victor s ays, “There was too much testosterone in the room.”

“Testosterone” is a hormone, a substance in your bo dy that controls certain functions in your body, that is typically associate d with males – with men. When people use the word “testosterone,” they’re usually  referring to men, but men acting – how should I say it – very manly, being ve ry tough. “I’m a man.” That sort of thing. Sort of John Wayne, if you remember who John Wayne was, the famous movie actor, or maybe Bruce Willis from Die Hard , right? He’s being very

masculine, very male. We could talk about there bei ng a lot of testosterone in that movie.

Well, that’s the problem Victor had with the yoga class, which is sort of funny because normally, at least here in Los Angeles, yog a is more associated with women. You’ll see women going to yoga classes a lot  more often than men. But this was a class, according to Victor, that was jus t men. Rosaria says, “That was a problem?” She’s confused.

Victor then asks her a question that indicates the real problem he had with the class: “Do you think I would be taking a yoga class  if I weren’t trying to meet women?!” You see, the reason Victor took the yoga class was to meet women, because in a typical yoga class, it’s mostly women who are there, and that was why Victor was taking the class. So, when the class  was all men, he was of course disappointed.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Victor: Humph!

Rosaria: What’s the matter?

Victor: I just got back from my first yoga class an d I was sorely disappointed.

Rosaria: I’ve heard that yoga is very good low-impa ct exercise and helps with stress relief. It’s supposed to calm the mind and s trengthen the body.

Victor: Yeah, right.

Rosaria: It sounds like you had a bad experience. D id you have a bad teacher?

Victor: The teacher was fine. I learned about mantr as and chakras, I learned breathing techniques, and I tried a few basic poses .

Rosaria: That all sounds right from my own experien ce, such as it is. But, there are a lot of different types of yoga. Maybe you nee d to try a different kind.

Victor: Yeah.

Rosaria: And that was a problem?

Victor: Do you think I would be taking a yoga class  if I weren’t trying to meet women?!
