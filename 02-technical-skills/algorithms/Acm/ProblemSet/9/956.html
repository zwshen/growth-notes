<P>
A slot machine accepts coins of two types, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN>
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN> euros. The game begins by pressing a button that makes the 
machine arbitrarily jump to any one of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> states.
Each coin you insert makes the machine move to a new state which is 
determined by the type of coin
and the present state (it may move to just the same state where it is). 
If you wait more than
5 seconds without inserting a coin the game ends and either you loose 
the coins you inserted
or you win the double of what you spent, depending on whether the state 
the machine stays in at the end is a
loose or a win state. To make you suffer more, after you insert a new 
coin, the machine tells you what would have
happened if you had stopped instead of going on.

<P>
For the sake of minimality, a machine cannot have two equivalent 
states.
Two states are equivalent if no matter the sequence of coins you 
insert, the result is the same
starting from one state or from the other. Notice that a sequence of 
zero coins is valid, although the victory in
such a case is just moral.

<P>
Given a slot machine, determine the sets of states that are equivalent
and for each set delete all the states except the first in alphabetical 
order, which is taken as
the valid representative of that identical behaviour set. Show these 
remaining states.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input file contains several test cases, each of them containing several lines as follows.

<P>
The first line of the input contains the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> (integer format) of 
states.
The states are labeled in alphabetic sequence, starting from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>, and 
there are at most 26.
So, if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = 6</SPAN>, the states are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN>-<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>F</I></SPAN>.
The next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines contain four characters each, separated by single 
spaces, where
the first is the name of a state, the second the state the machine 
moves into if a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1</SPAN> euro coin
is inserted, the third the state the machine moves into if a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2</SPAN> euro 
coin
is inserted, and the fourth a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> if the state is a win state or a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-</SPAN> 
if it is a loose state.

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each test case, your program must output the states that remain, after deleting the 
equivalent states, in a single line, separated by single spaces.
