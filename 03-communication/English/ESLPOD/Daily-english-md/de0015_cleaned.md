# Problems at the Office

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 15 – Problems at the Office.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 15. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

Today's podcast is about problems at work. Lucy and  I are going to talk about a problem that Lucy had at work and how we thought sh e should solve the problem. Listen to our conversation and then I'll t alk about some of the expressions that we used. Let's get started 

[start of dialogue] 

Lucy: Hey Jeff, can I pick your brain for a minute?  

Jeff: Sure, what's up?  

Lucy: Well, I have a sticky situation at work and I  wanted to get your input. You're always so tactful. 

Jeff: Thanks. I'm not sure I can help but I'll give  you my two cents. 

Lucy: Well, it's like this. There's this guy I work  with who is always making jokes about the boss. Don't get me wrong. I like a good j oke now and then, especially about the boss. But, sometimes he goes too far.  

Jeff. What do you mean?  

Lucy: Well, just the other day, he got a picture of f the Internet and cut and pasted the boss's head onto it. Let's just say it w as a very unflattering picture of him.  

Jeff: Hmm. That's really unprofessional, but it sou nds harmless enough, if he kept it to himself or just showed it to a few fr iends. 

Lucy: That's just it. He didn't keep it to himself.  He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the entire company, including the top brass.  

Jeff: You're joking, right?  

 Lucy: No, I'm not. This is what I meant when I said  he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit. 

Jeff: Is he a friend of yours? 

Lucy: No, not really. But, I don't want the guy to get fired. He's actually a good person. He's just clueless, that's all. 

Jeff: Well, that's a tough one. Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before he gets fired.  

Lucy: Thanks. I appreciate it.  

Jeff: Oh, it's no big deal. Let's go get a bite to eat.  

Lucy: Sure. Sounds good to me.

Our dialogue begins with Lucy saying to me, “Hey Je ff.” “Hey” is an informal way of saying “hi” or “hello.” She says, “Hey Jeff, can  I pick your brain for a minute?” “To pick (pick) someone's brain” means to get their  opinion, to get their advice, to ask them what they think. Lucy wants to pick my bra in for a minute, which means for short time, not necessarily just 60 seconds.  

I say, “Sure,” meaning, “yes.” “What's up?” meaning  what is the problem? What is going on? Lucy says, “Well, I have a sticky situ ation at work.” When we say something is a “sticky (sticky) situation,” we mean  it's a difficult situation, a situation that is possibly embarrassing or difficul t for someone to talk about. We might also describe it as a sensitive situation. Lu cy wants to get my input on this problem. Your “input” (input) is your opinion of so mething, your advice about something. Lucy says that “I am always so tactful.”  “To be tactful” (tactful)” means to be polite, to always say the right thing, to never insult anyone – someone who's very good with words who doesn't ever  cause problems with other people, who never makes other people upset. W e could describe that person as being tactful.  

Obviously, Lucy doesn't know me very well. I'm not very tactful at all. But, this is just a story, so, we’ll imagine that I am tactful. I say, “Thanks! I'm not sure I can help but I'll give you my two cents.” “To give some one their two cents” means to give them your opinion. It's the same, basically, a s “input.” It's an informal  

expression. “Two cents” is not worth very much mone y, so the expression implies the idea that yes I will give you my opinion, but i t might not be worth very much. It might not be very useful to you. You're being humbl e. You're saying. I don't really know very much but I will try to help you.  

Lucy says, “Well, it's like this,” which is an info rmal way of saying here's the situation. Here's the description of the situation.  She says, “There's this guy I work with who’s always making jokes about the boss. ” The “boss” would be the leader, the head of their group or their company. S he says, “Don't get me wrong.” That expression “don't get me wrong,” is used when you want to say to someone “Don't misunderstand me.” “Don't get the wrong idea .” We use it when we’re going to say something that a person might interpre t incorrectly. When we say something to someone who may think, “Oh, that's a b ad thing,” or “You're saying something bad,” we use this expression “Don't get m e wrong.” So, “listen carefully and wait until I finish my explanation.” That's another way of describing the meaning of this expression. 

Lucy says, “I like a good joke now and then.” “Now and then” means every once in a while, occasionally. She says she likes a good  joke especially about the boss. “But sometimes he goes too far.” “To go too f ar” means to do something that would normally be okay, but to do too much of it, to do it in such a way that it hurts other people or it bothers other people, that 's to go too far. This “guy” at work – and “guy” in the singular is always, or almo st always a man – goes too far in making jokes about the boss. He says things that  could make the boss or other people in the office angry or upset.  

I ask, “What do you mean? And Lucy gives an example  of him going too far. She says, “Well, just the other day,” meaning just a fe w days ago or recently, “he got a picture off the Internet and cut and pasted the b oss’ head on to it.” So this guy at Lucy's work downloaded a picture from the Intern et and then using some sort of special software, perhaps Photoshop, he put the head of the boss – a picture of the head of the boss – on this photograph. We do n't know what the photograph was exactly, but we can guess that it wa s something funny.  

Lucy says, “Let's just say it was a very unflatteri ng picture of him.” The expression “Let's just say” is used when you don't want to give the exact details. You don't want to go into a very detailed descripti on of something. You just want to give the person an idea what you're talking, abo ut a general idea of what you are talking about. That's when we would use this ex pression “Let's just say.” Not wanting to describe the picture in detail, Lucy say s “Let's just say it was a very unflattering picture of him.” “To flatter” (flatter ), as a verb, means to say something nice about someone.  “Unflattering” as an  adjective, would be  

something that is not nice, something that doesn't complement that person, something that makes that person look bad.  

Jeff says – that's me – “Hmm. That sounds really un professional.” Notice again the prefix “un.” “Un” means not. So, when I say tha t's really “unprofessional,” I mean that's not professional. That's not something you should do in a work environment. “But,” I say, “it sounds” – it appears  – “harmless enough.” “To be harmless” (harmless) means to not cause any problem s, to not be very serious, to not cause any injury or damage. I say that the p icture is harmless enough, meaning it's no big deal. “If,” I say, “he kept it to himself or showed it to a few friends.” So, it's harmless enough only if this guy  kept it to himself, meaning he didn't show anyone else or only showed it, only gav e it to, a few friends.  

Lucy says, “That's just it.” That expression “that' s just it” means now you’ve identified the problem. You’ve said something that indicates the problem and now I'm going to tell you what that is. Lucy continues,  “He didn't keep it to himself. He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the  entire company, including the top brass.” So, this guy at Lucy's work sent the pi cture via email, using email, to everyone in the company, including the top brass. “ The top brass” are the bosses, the people who run the entire company. If i t's a large company, you may have several different levels of bosses. The top br ass would be the most important ones – the president, the vice president and so forth.  

I then say, “You're joking, right?” I am asking if Lucy is making a joke, if she's just kidding. She says, “No, I'm not. This is what I mea n when I said he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit” – when to stop, when not to go too far. Jeff says, “Is he a friend of yours?” Lucy says, “No, no t really, but I don't want the guy to get fired.” “To get fired” means to lose your jo b.  

“He's actually a good person. He's just clueless. T hat's all.” “To be clueless” (clueless) means to not understand really what's go ing on, someone who is ignorant, someone who doesn't quite understand the implications of everything he says or does. That would be someone who is cluel ess. Notice also the suffix (less), which comes at the end of this word. It mea ns without. Before, we had the word “harmless,” meaning without harm. Here, we hav e “clueless,” meaning without a clue, without an idea.  

I say, “Well, that's a tough one.” That's a difficu lt situation. “Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before  he gets fired.” “To cut something out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o stop, to no longer do it, especially when we're talking about something you s houldn't be doing anyway, something that's bad. Lucy says to me, “Thanks, I a ppreciate it.” I say “Oh, it's no  

big deal.” It's not something that she needs to tha nk me for. “Let's go get a bite to eat,” I say. “To go get a bite (bite) to eat” means  to go and get some food, to go to lunch or to go to dinner. Lucy says, “Sure, soun ds good to me,” meaning yes, that's a good idea. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
