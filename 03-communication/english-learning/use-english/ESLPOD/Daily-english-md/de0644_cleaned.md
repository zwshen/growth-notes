[start of dialogue] 

Event organizer:  Do you hear that?  It’s a packed house  and your presentation was a hit.  People are clamoring for more.   

Herman:  I can’t believe it.  I wasn’t expecting that ki nd of reception.  The audience really seemed to like it. 

Event organizer:  Like it?  They were on the edge of th eir seats.   

Herman:  The presentation actually started slowly, but it  seemed to gain traction in the middle. 

Event organizer:  You had the audience hooked from the  start.  You could have heard a pin drop in there when you were going over you r main points.  Your presentation is undoubtedly the highlight of the confer ence.   

Herman:  Thanks.  I’m still in shock.  Maybe if I tweaked it a little, I could give this presentation at the national conference.   

Event organizer:  You’ll have time later to think abou t that.  Right now, you need to get out there for the Q&A.  They’re waiting for yo u. 

Herman:  But I don’t have anything else to say. 

Event organizer:  Just get out there.  Your adoring pub lic is waiting for you!

Our dialogue begins with the event organizer, the pers on who is in charge of or who is running this particular event where the presentat ion is going to be made, she says to Herman, the person who is going to give the pr esentation – the presenter, “Did you hear that?  It’s a packed house and your presentation was a hit.”  A “packed (packed) house” is when you have a very la rge audience, lots of people who come and they take up every seat in the pla ce where the event is being held.  Sometimes we say there’s “standing room onl y,” meaning there are no more places to sit because there are so many people the re.  That’s a packed house.  It doesn’t mean that it’s a house that you live in.  The word “house” here just refers to the place – the auditorium or stadium wh ere the event is taking place. 

The event organizer says that Herman’s presentation was a  hit.  To say something is “a hit” means that it is very successful; it was very popular.  We talk about hit songs or hit movies; these are songs and movi es that are very popular. “Hit” has a number of other definitions; take a look at  our Learning Guide for those.  Finally the event organizer says, “People are clam oring for more.”  “To clamor” (clamor) means to ask for something but in a very l oud way, to make a lot of noise demanding or insisting that something happ en.  The people are clamoring for more, they’re wanting Herman to do more  of his presentation or to make the presentation longer – to continue it. 

Herman says, “I can’t believe it.  I wasn’t expecting that  kind (or that type) of reception.”  “Reception” comes from the verb “to receive .”  It’s a noun meaning the way or the manner in which something is received, the  way people react to something or react to someone.  The presentation got a  good reception; it was “well received” we might also say.   

“The audience,” Herman says, the people who were listen ing, “seemed to like it.” The event organizer says, “Like it?  They were on the ed ge of their seats.”  She says “like it” meaning they didn’t just like it, they loved it.  “They were on the edge (edge) of their seats.”  The “seat” is where you sit in  an auditorium or a stadium. The “edge” is at the very end or border, if you will, of the seat.  It’s where your body is just barely on the seat.  The expression “to be on the edge of your seat” means that you are so interested, you’re so eager to hear  or see something that you may be sitting up in your seat, almost like you’re abou t to stand up.  That’s to be on the edge of one’s seat.  Herman says, “The presenta tion actually started slowly, but it seemed to gain traction in the middle.”  The expression “to gain traction” (traction) means to have more success, to get bett er.  To begin to be more well received, that’s to gain traction.  

 The event organizer says, “You had the audience hooked fr om the start.”  “To be hooked” (hooked) means to like something and need someth ing, you want more of it; you like it and you want even more.  This could b e true in, for example, someone who is using certain drugs.  They may be hooked on – notice the preposition we use, “on” – hooked on a certain drug.  The other words here would be “addicted,” especially if you are talking about drugs.  However, to be “hooked” or “hooked on (something)” is an expression we can use for just about anything.  In this case, Herman had the audience hooked; in other words, the audience was very interested.  They needed and wanted mo re from the start – from the very beginning of his presentation.  She says, “Y ou could have heard a pin drop in there.”  The expression “you could have heard  a pin drop” means that it is a situation where everyone is quiet because they are  interested in something; they want to hear what will happen next.  W hen someone makes an announcement in front of a group of people that is ver y important, everyone will be quiet and listen.  That’s where you could hear a pi n drop.  Well, this is the past tense, so the event organizer says, “You could have heard a  pin drop,” it was that quiet.  It was so quiet you could hear a pin dropping  on the floor.  A “pin,” I should mention is a small piece of usually metal that you put in to something – you stick into something, usually to keep something in place.  For example, you may have an announcement – a piece of paper, and you take a kind of pin called a “push pin,” and you put into the wood or you put it into th e board so that the announcement – the piece of paper stays.  Well that’s a p in; it’s a small, sharp piece of metal that goes into something. 

You could have heard a pin drop when Herman was “going  over,” or talking about, his “main points,” the main or most important t hings in the speech.  She says to Herman, “Your presentation is undoubtedly the hig hlight of the conference.”  “Undoubtedly” means clearly, without a dou bt, obviously.  A “highlight” is the best part of something, the most int eresting or beautiful or important part of something.  You could say, “I went t o Rome, and the highlight of my trip was to see Michelangelo’s Pietà,” that’s the high light, that was the best part. 

Herman says, “Thanks.  I’m still in shock.”  “To be in shock”  means to be very surprised by something, unable to fully understand it an d sometimes accept it. You can be in shock over a good thing; you can be in shock over a bad thing. This is definitely a good thing.  Herman says, “Maybe if I  tweaked it a little, I could give this presentation at the national conference.”   This may be a conference or a meeting for a given city or state, but H erman thinks if he “tweaked” his presentation, meaning if he improved it, if he made some small  

 changes while leaving most of it the same, but making sma ll changes to improve it, then he could go on to a bigger conference. 

The organizer says, “You’ll have time later to think abou t that.  Right now, you need to get out there for the Q&A.”  “Q” stands for q uestion; “A” stands for answer.  The “Q&A” is something that happens at the end  of many presentations, where the people who are listening to you – your audi ence – gets a chance to ask you questions about your topic. 

Herman says, “But I don’t have anything else to say.”  Th e event organizer says, “Just get out there (meaning go out back in front of th e people).  Your adoring public is waiting for you!”  “To adore” means to like o r admire someone or something.  Here, it’s used modify “public,” which are th e people – the people who listen to you or who watch you.  So, your “adoring p ublic” are the people who adore you, who love you, who want to see more of you . 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
