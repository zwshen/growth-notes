[start of dialogue] 

Josey:  Hello, I’m Josey Kim. 

Curt:  Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet  with me.   

Josey:  You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that government contract we’re bidding on, is that right? 

Curt:  Absolutely.  I’m sure I can be of service to your com pany and secure that contract without too much difficulty. 

Josey:  I appreciate your confidence, but can you tell me  more about how you plan to do that? 

Curt:  I think the less said the better.  Let’s just say that I have friends in high places. 

Josey:  I’m not sure I understand you. 

Curt:  Come on, you know how business is done on Capitol Hill.  If you line the right pockets, it’s not difficult to pull some strings to get what you want. 

 Josey:  Are you suggesting that our company use bribery to g et preferential treatment on our bid? 

Curt:  I’m simply saying that backroom deals are business as usual in the government. 

Josey:  If you’re suggesting that we hire you to do influe nce peddling, I can tell you now that we’re not interested.  Corruption may be rampant in government, but we’re not willing to do anything unethical to get  a contract. 

Curt:  Suit yourself, but without somebody like me doin g your dirty work, there’s no way you’re going to win that contract. 

Josey:  That may be, Mr. West, but that’s a chance we’re wi lling to take. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Josey saying, “Hello, I’m Josey Ki m.”  Curt says, “Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.”  Josey says, “You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that g overnment contract we’re bidding on, is that right?”  A “contract” is a legal a greement between two people or two groups, where one of the “parties,” as they’re ca lled – one of the people or the groups agrees to give something, to do something fo r the other group or person, and that other party gives them money or somethin g else of value. 

Josey is talking about a government contract that her busin ess is bidding on.  “To bid” (bid) means to offer to do something, in this case  for a particular amount of money.  Often the government has work that it needs done , and it has businesses do that work.  But the businesses have to bid; th ey have to say, “I’ll do it for this much,” “I’ll do it for that much,” and then the government picks the best bid, sometimes the cheapest or the one that will d o the most for the money. “To bid” has other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those. 

Curt says, “Absolutely,” meaning yes, we can help you get th at government contract.  He says, “I’m sure I can be of service to your com pany and secure that contract without too much difficulty.”  “To be of service t o (someone)” means to be useful, to be helpful to that person.  “To secure” h ere means to get, to obtain. “Secure” has other meanings in English; those – guess wha t – are in the Learning Guide. 

 Josey says, “I appreciate your confidence, but can you tell me more about how you plan to do that?”  So Josey wants to know how Curt ca n help her company get this government contract, and Curt says, “I think the l ess said the better.” This expression, or phrase, “the less said the better,” is used to indicate that you don’t want to give a lot of information – a lot of d etails about something, perhaps because the details would be about something bad, unet hical, immoral, or wrong in some way, and the other person doesn’t need to know t hat information. Sometimes the phrase is simply used to mean that I don’t want to talk about it or that’s not something we want to talk about because, perh aps, it’s embarrassing to someone: “The less said the better.”   

Curt says, “Let’s just say that I have friends in high place s.”  “To have friends in high places” means that you have personal or professional relationships with people who have a lot of power.  Perhaps you know the g overnor of your state.  If I knew our current Governor Schwarzenegger I would say th at I have friends in high places. 

Josey says, “I’m not sure I understand you.”  Curt says, “Com e on (meaning be reasonable; don’t joke with me), you know how business is d one on Capitol Hill.” Capitol Hill is in Washington, D.C.; it’s where the bu ilding – the Capitol Building is located, where you have the U.S. Representatives and the  U.S. Senators.  They meet in the Capitol Building, so when someone says Capit ol Hill, they’re referring to the Senate and the House of Representatives, or sim ply the Congress, which is another word for those two groups. 

Curt says, “If you line the right pockets, it’s not difficu lt to pull some strings to get what you want.”  “To line (line) the right pockets” me ans to give money to powerful people so that they will make a particular de cision or take a particular view on something.  You’re basically influencing them ill egally – unethically – by giving them money.  This is a type of what we would call more generally “corruption,” where people in the government are takin g money, or houses or vacations or whatever, in exchange for making certain decisio ns to help the people who gave him or her that money.  That’s what it  means to line someone’s pockets.  He says, “it’s not difficult to pull some strings t o get what you want.” The phrase “to pull some strings” means to do something i n secret, something unusual, perhaps unethical to influence a person or a  situation.  It doesn’t always have to be something that is illegal.  “To pull some st rings” means simply to use your influence – your power to get something done.  But  with Curt, we kind of think it is unethical! 

 Josey says, “Are you suggesting that our company use bribery to get preferential treatment on our bid?”  “Bribery” (bribery) is the i llegal practice of giving money to politicians or other decision-makers to make them do wha t you want to do, so it’s to line someone’s pockets, as we said earlier.  That’s br ibery, and the verb is “to bribe.”  “Preferential treatment” means someone is goi ng to be favorable toward you; they’re going to make decisions that help you or your  organization.  Again, if this is done because they received a bribe then that woul d be illegal and unethical. 

Curt says, “I’m simply saying that backroom deals are business a s usual in the government.”  A “backroom (one word) deal” is an agree ment that happens in secret, without people knowing about it, certainly witho ut the general public – the average person knowing about it.  “Business as usual” here means the way things have always been done in this particular kind of bu siness or in this type of organization, in this case the government.  Curt is saying  that the government always has these secret agreements – these secret deals, that ’s business as usual – as normal. 

Josey says, “If you’re suggesting that we hire you to do infl uence peddling, I can tell you now we’re not interested.”  “Influence peddli ng” (peddling) is, again, the illegal practice of using your authority or your power as a way to get money or favors from other people.  Josey is saying that her company is not going to give Curt money so that he can go bribe government officials.  She says, “Corruption may be rampant in government, but we’re not willing to do anything unethical to get a contract.”  “Corruption” is, as we mentioned befo re, dishonest behavior by people who have a lot of power, especially governments.  “Rampant” (rampant) means very common, not unusual; often a negative thing t hat’s very common. “Unethical” means wrong, immoral, often illegal.  But  unethical doesn’t necessarily mean it’s illegal, but it does mean that it’s wrong; it’s against the common understanding of right and wrong. 

Curt says, “Suit yourself,” meaning you can do what you wa nt to do; I don’t care. “Suit yourself, but without somebody like me doing your d irty work, there’s no way you’re going to win that contract.”  “Dirty work” her e means doing things that are not pleasant, perhaps are wrong, but that you are going to have to do.  Curt says that if you don’t do this – if you don’t bribe the g overnment officials – you won’t win the contract; the contract will not be given t o you.  Josey says, “That may be, Mr. West (that may be correct, she means), but tha t’s a chance we’re willing to take,” meaning that’s a risk that we are wil ling to take.  Perhaps we won’t get the contract, but we won’t do anything illeg al or unethical. 

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Josey:  Hello, I’m Josey Kim. 

Curt:  Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet  with me.
