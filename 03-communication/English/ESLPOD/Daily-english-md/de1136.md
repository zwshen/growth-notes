This episode is a dialogue between Oliver and Alena  about missing a deadline. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Oliver: I’ve just had to tell a client that I’m run ning behind and I won’t make the deadline.

Alena: How did she take it?

Oliver: Not so well, at first. I knew she wouldn’t be happy, so I’ve been in a dilemma for days: Should I tell her now that I’m go ing to miss the deadline, or wait until the deadline had passed.

Alena: For what it’s worth, I think you did the rig ht thing. It gives her advance notice in case it affects other parts of her projec t.

Oliver: That’s what I thought, too. I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.

Alena: Did she take you up on it?

Oliver: No, she said that giving me a three-day ext ension wouldn’t set her back, but if it dragged on for longer than that, it would  put her in an awkward spot, and she would let me know.

Alena: I’m glad you came to an understanding. So yo u’ll have it done by the new deadline, right?

 Oliver: Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, fo od, or bathroom breaks for the next week.

Alena: That’s very dedicated of you, though potenti ally messy.

Oliver begins our dialogue by saying, “I’ve just ha d to tell a client that I’m running behind and I won’t make the deadline.” A “client” ( client) is a person you work for, usually a person for whom you do some sort of servi ce. It’s sometimes used the same way we use the word “customer,” although “cust omer” usually means that the person is buying something from you, some physi cal object – a book, or a car, or a computer.

Oliver tells his client that he’s “running behind.”  The phrasal verb “to run behind” (behind) means to be late, to have something take l onger than planned so that you will probably not finish it when you are suppos ed to finish it. “I’m running behind” means I’m late. “To make the deadline” (dea dline) means to complete something when you are supposed to complete it, to complete it on time. A “deadline” is a time or a day by which you have to finish something. Here in the United States, everyone has to pay their taxes by t he 15th of April. The personal tax deadline is April 15th.

Alena says, “How did she,” meaning Oliver’s client,  “take it?” The expression here “to take it” means to accept something, to rea ct to some news, some information – usually bad information, although not  always. Someone may say, “Well my boss fired his secretary.” He fired the pe rson who was working for him. You might ask, “Well, how did he take it?” How did he react? “What was his emotional state?” you might say. Alena asks how Oli ver’s client took the information or the notification that he wasn’t goin g to make his deadline.

Oliver says, “Not so well, at first,” meaning right  after he told her. “I knew she wouldn’t be happy,” he continues, “so I’ve been in a dilemma for days.” A “dilemma” (dilemma) is a situation where you don’t know what to do. It’s a difficult or confusing situation that makes it hard or tough for you to make a decision. Often, we use this when we have two different possi ble solutions and we can’t decide which solution is better.

Oliver then tells us what the two possible solution s to his dilemma were. He says, “Should I tell her now that I’m going to miss the d eadline, or wait until the deadline has passed.” “To miss (miss) the deadline”  means to not make the

deadline. It’s the opposite of “making the deadline .” “To miss the deadline” means that you don’t complete what you are supposed  to complete on time.

Oliver’s dilemma was deciding if he should tell his  client that he wasn’t going to make the deadline – that he was going to in fact mi ss the deadline – or just wait until the deadline had passed, meaning after the de adline. Alena answers, “For what it’s worth, I think you did the right thing.” The expression “For what it’s worth” (worth) is used when we’re giving someone in formation that we hope will be helpful but often it isn’t, or perhaps you’re ju st unsure if it will be helpful or not. Alena says that she thinks Oliver did the right thi ng.

She says, “It gives her advance notice in case it a ffects other parts of her project.” “Notice” (notice) is information you give  someone about some situation. “Advance notice” would be information before the ev ent occurs. If you are going to leave at five o’clock this afternoon, you may say to your boss, “I want to give you advance notice that I’m leaving at five o’clock  today instead of my normal time at six o’clock.” If you wait until five o’cloc k to tell your boss, you are not giving advance notice, and your boss might not be v ery happy with you.

Oliver says, “That’s what I thought, too.” In other  words, yes – it was good to give her advance notice. “I also offered to make up for any inconvenience the delay would cause.” “To make up for” something is a very useful phrasal verb in English. It means to do something that corrects a p roblem or a mistake that you have made. It may also be used as a way of apologiz ing for a mistake that you made.

Let’s say you were supposed to take your wife out t o dinner tonight, and you can’t because you have to work late at the office. You may call your wife and say, “I’m sorry, I can’t go to dinner tonight, but I wil l make up for it by taking you to a movie tomorrow night.” I’m not sure if your wife wi ll agree that taking her to a movie makes up for going out to dinner, but that co uld be a way to use that expression. Oliver says he offered to make up for t he “inconvenience the delay (delay) would cause.” A “delay” is when something h appens later than it should, later than it was scheduled to happen.

Alena says, “Did she take you up on it?” “To take s omeone up on” something is another very useful phrase. It means to accept anot her person’s offer to do something. If someone says, “If you need a ride to the airport tomorrow, just let me know,” you could call the person later and say, “I’d like to take you up on your offer to take me to the airport.” In other words, y ou’re agreeing to let that person help you. Alena asks if Oliver’s client took him up  on his offer to make up for the

inconvenience. Oliver says, “No, she said that givi ng me a three-day extension wouldn’t set her back.”

An “extension” (extension) here means additional ti me to complete a task. If you are late on a project you are supposed to be comple ting, you might go to your boss and say, “I need an extension” – I need more t ime. Oliver’s client tells him that giving him a three-day extension would not “se t her back.” “To set (set) someone back” means to create a delay for someone e lse, to make someone else be behind schedule. You could also say, “This problem set us back” or “set me back.” It caused me to no longer be able to meet  the deadlines I was hoping to meet.

Oliver’s client told him, however, that if this del ay “dragged on” for longer than three days, “it would put her in an awkward spot.” “To drag (drag) on” is a phrasal verb meaning to last for a longer time than anticip ated – to go at a very slow pace, a very slow speed. If the delay dragged on for longer than three days, Oliver’s client said it would put her in an “awkwar d (awkward) spot (spot).” A “spot” here means a situation. An “awkward spot” wo uld be a difficult or uncomfortable situation.

Alena says, “I’m glad you came to an understanding. ” This is a very common phrase in business, “to come to an understanding.” “To come to an understanding” means to reach an agreement, to agre e on something. “My brothers and sisters came to an understanding about  what we should do with my parents’ house.” We came to an understanding. We ca me to an agreement.

Alena continues, “So you’ll have it done by the new  deadline, right?” Oliver says, “Yes, even if I have to do without sleep, food, or bathroom breaks for the next week. “To do without” something is not to do someth ing, especially when normally you would consider it a necessary thing to  do. “To do without sleep” means that you are not going to go to sleep. You’re  going to, in this case, continue working. Sleep is normally considered nece ssary, so to do without it is considered a sacrifice, a difficult thing to do.

Doing without food would also be very difficult if you did it for a week. Oliver obviously doesn’t really mean he’s going to do with out food for a week. Alena says, “That’s very dedicated of you,” and “potentia lly messy.” “Dedicated” (dedicated) means committed or devoted, wanting to do a particular thing. “I’m very dedicated to working out in the afternoon, to exercising every afternoon, which I do on a treadmill.” I’m dedicated to that. I am committed to it.

Alena says that Oliver is dedicated. He’s dedicated  to completing this task for his client, though his idea of doing without bathroom b reaks is “potentially,” or possibly, “messy.” “Messy” (messy) is unorganized o r dirty. Of course, bathroom breaks would mean going to the bathroom, and you ce rtainly do not want to do without that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oliver: I’ve just had to tell a client that I’m run ning behind and I won’t make the deadline.

Alena: How did she take it?

Oliver: Not so well, at first. I knew she wouldn’t be happy, so I’ve been in a dilemma for days: Should I tell her now that I’m go ing to miss the deadline, or wait until the deadline had passed.

 Our scriptwriter never misses a deadline. She’s too  organized for that. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
