This episode is called “Internet Dating.”  It’s about fi nding love on the Internet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kevin:  I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating service.

Eun:  What do you have to lose?  This website says that it screens all of its members.  Let’s look at some of the profiles.

Kevin:  All right.  We have to select the criteria for  a search.  Let’s see...gender – “female”; location – “Los Angeles”; age range – “26 t o 35.”

Eun:  Wow, you got 243 hits.  I think you’d better na rrow down the search criteria.

Kevin:  Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 5 0-mile radius.  That gives us 72 hits.

Eun:  Click on that one.  Let’s see.  This woman is 29 an d she’s an accountant. She’s very pretty.

Kevin:  Do you think people would upload any photos tha t weren’t flattering?

 Eun:  Still, I think she’s promising, don’t you?  Anyway,  who doesn’t tell a few white lies in their dating profile?  It’s not like you ’re misrepresenting yourself.  If you sign up for a trial membership, you’ll have to do the same thing.

Kevin:  Will I?  What will I need to lie about?

Eun:  Nothing, nothing.  You’re perfect just the way yo u are.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kevin saying to Eun, “I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating ser vice.”  He says he’s “not so sure,” that means he has doubts, he doesn’t know if thi s is a good idea.  An “Internet dating service” is an online business that helps you find and meet other people you may be romantically interested in.

Eun says, “What do you have to lose?”  This expression, “what  do you have to lose,” means that you should do something because nothing  bad can happen as a result.  It isn’t going to hurt you in anyway: “What d o you have to lose?”  This is sometimes said when someone, perhaps, is in a desperate situation, in a situation where they don’t have a lot of other options and doing something will be better than doing nothing.

Eun says, “This website says that it screens all of its member s.”  To “screen,” as a verb, here means to review or to look at something and  decide if it is acceptable or if it is good enough.  If you go into a co mpany the company will screen the people who want to work there – the people  who are applying for the job.  They will look at their information and decide who they want to interview, for example.  “Screen” has a couple of different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Eun suggests to Kevin that they look at some of the profil es.  A “profile” is usually a short description that gives some general information a bout something, especially a person or a company.  So, on these Internet d ating sites they have profiles of different people that describe them in a g eneral way.  Kevin says, “All right (okay).  We have to select the criteria for a sear ch.”  “Criteria” is the plural for the noun “criterion” (criterion).  A “criterion” i s something that you use judge someone or some other thing, some sort of rule or standa rd that you use to decide if something is good enough or not.  So for exam ple, if you are applying

 for a job one of the criteria may be that you have a co llege degree (you graduated from college).  That’s an example of “criteri a.”

Well, Kevin says they have to select the criteria for a sea rch.  To “search” for something is to look for something, so when we are on the Internet we can search for things.  In this case, Kevin is searching for h is love, his true love, somewhere out there in the world.  Kevin gives some crite ria.  He begins with gender – male or female, Kevin is looking for a female ; location – here in Los Angeles; and finally age range.  The “range” of someth ing is the highest and lowest values or number of something.  “Age range” refe rs to the ages of the people, in this case, that Kevin is looking for.  So the age range, for example, for those who go to high school in the United States would be 14 to 18, from 14 years old up to 18 years old.  Kevin is looking for women  between the ages of 26 and 35; that’s his age range.  Men often look for wome n who are their age or younger, and this is, perhaps, the case with Kevin.  We do n’t know.  Kevin could be an old person – 45, for example, like me, looking for a younger woman.  Well, not me, Kevin!

Back to the story: Eun says, “Wow, you got 243 hits.”  A “hi t,” when you are talking about searching for something, is finding someth ing that meets your criteria (that fits your criteria).  So if you put in,  for example, ESL Podcast and you search in a search engine, such as Google, the first h it (the first link) you will see on the page is for ESL Podcast, this podcast.  That’s a “hit.”  “Hit” has several meanings in English – different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

So Eun says that Kevin got 243 women who live in Los Ange les between the ages of 26 and 35 who are registered on this Internet dating service.  Eun says, “I think you’d better narrow down the search criteria. ”  To “narrow down” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to become more specific in wha t you are looking for, to be more specific.  In this case, he has to find more s pecific criteria so that there are fewer hits; he has too many, right now.

Kevin says, “Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 50-mile radius.” “Radius” (radius) is the distance between the middle of  a circle and the edge of the circle.  It’s used here to specify or to describe an are a around where, in this case, Kevin lives.  So a “50-mile radius” would be anythin g that would be 50 miles from Kevin’s house, or anyone.  When he does that, he gets 72 hits – 72 women who live within 50 miles of his house.

 Eun says, “Click on that one.”  She’s selects one and says, “Le t’s see.  This woman is 29 and she’s an accountant.”  She works in a busin ess where she takes care of the money, figuring out how much money the company has, for example.  “She’s very pretty,” Eun says.  Kevin says, “Do you th ink people would upload any photos that weren’t flattering?”  “Flatter ing,” as an adjective, means attractive, something that makes you look attractive.  So what Kevin is asking here is, well, of course the picture that the woman pu ts on the website is beautiful, because everyone would put the most beautiful  photograph of themselves they could find.  It’s clear that Kevin is a lit tle “skeptical,” that is, he has some doubts about whether this woman really is very pre tty.

Eun says, “Still (meaning even though, despite what you say), I think she’s promising.”  When something is “promising,” here we me an it has a lot of potential to be good or useful.  It’s something that se ems good or interesting, but you’re not quite sure – you’re not certain, but it loo ks good.  Eun says this woman looks promising.  “Anyway,” she says (in any case), “who doesn ’t tell a few white lies in their dating profile?”  A “white lie” is a sm all or unimportant lie, something that isn’t true but it isn’t serious.  So for example, i f you meet a woman and you say to her, “I’m five feet, 10 inches,” when you’re reall y five feet, nine inches. Well, that’s a “white lie,” you want to make yourself se em taller.  But if you tell her that you are single when, in fact, you are married, wel l, that would be a little bit more than a white lie!

So, Eun is saying that people sometimes don’t tell the co mplete truth in their dating profiles on these Internet websites.  Eun says, “It ’s not like you’re misrepresenting yourself.”  To “misrepresent” means to s ay something to make someone believe that thing, but it isn’t true.  So if I said I’m single, when in reality I’m married – and I am married – then that would be  misrepresenting myself.  I would be essentially telling someone something that wasn ’t true.

Well, Eun says that a few white lies (a few exaggeratio ns) isn’t the same as misrepresenting yourself.  She then says, “If you sign up for a trial membership, you’ll have to do the same thing.”  If you “sign up,” i f you become a member, you will have to do the same thing.  Some websites offer wh at is called a “trial (trial) membership,” which is where you can sign up for the membe rship for a week or a month, some period of time, to see if you like it, a nd then if you like it you can continue to use it by paying for it.

Kevin says, “Will I?” meaning will it be necessary for me,  also, to tell some white lies.  “What will I need to lie about?”  Eun says, “No thing, nothing.  You’re perfect

 just the way you are.”  Of course, Eun doesn’t really be lieve that, but she wants Kevin to think that he’s perfect.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kevin:  I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating service.

Eun:  What do you have to lose?  This website says that it screens all of its members.  Let’s look at some of the profiles.

Kevin:  All right.  We have to select the criteria for  a search.  Let’s see...gender – “female”; location – “Los Angeles”; age range – “26 t o 35.”

Eun:  Wow, you got 243 hits.  I think you’d better na rrow down the search criteria.

Kevin:  Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 5 0-mile radius.  That gives us 72 hits.

Eun:  Click on that one.  Let’s see.  This woman is 29 an d she’s an accountant. She’s very pretty.
