A woman was having some trouble with her heart, so she went to see the doctor. He was a new docotr, and did not know her, so he first asked some questions, and one of them was, "How old are you?"

"Well," she answered, "I don't remeber, docotr, but I will try to think." She thought for a minute and then said, "Yes, I remember now, docotr! When I married, I was eighteen years old, and my husband was thirty. Now my husband is sixty, I know. And that is twice thirty, So I am twice eighteen. That is thirty-six, isn't it?"

B: Oh hello, Sally. This is Dave Thomson here. Could I speak to Jim please?

B: Any idea when he might be back?
A: Well, he shouldn't be long. He said he was just going to get some paint. But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back.

A: All right, Goodbye, Dave.
B: Thank then Sally, Goodbye.
