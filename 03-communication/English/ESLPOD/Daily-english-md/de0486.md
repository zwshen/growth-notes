This episode is called “Having Limited Mobility.”  “Mobil ity” is the ability to move around.  It will be a dialogue between Gail and Mike  using some vocabulary that would be related to people who are not able to move around with their body as easily as others.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gail:  Oh!

Mike:  Are you okay?

Gail:  Yeah, I’m just not used to these crutches yet.  The doctor said I should start using them if I ever want to get out of this whe elchair, but I don’t have the strength to stand up.

Mike:  You’ll get the hang of it.  Don’t lose heart.

Gail:  It should be easy now that my arm is out of the cast, but it just seems impossible.  I feel I’m going to lose my balance each ti me I try to stand up.

Mike:  Try again, and this time lean on me and I’ll tr y to serve as your legs until you can find your balance.

Gail:  I wish I didn’t feel so utterly useless.  It’s so f rustrating!

Mike:  I know.  Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try.  The next thing you know, you’ll be limping along and then runni ng a marathon.  It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back.

 Gail:  Yeah, right.  Okay, first things first.  Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate this time.

Our dialogue begins with Gail saying, “Oh!”  She, we t hink, has hurt herself or is in pain.  Mike says, “Are you okay?”  Gail says, “Yeah, I’m  just not used to these crutches yet.”  She’s not used to – she’s not accustomed to th ese crutches.  A “crutch” is a long stick that you put underneath your arms,  in what we call the “armpit,” that’s the part that is underneath your shoul der.  You use the crutches to move more easily when your legs are injured for some reason.  So if you break your leg, you’ll probably be given two crutches to help  you walk more easily.

Gail says, “The doctor said I should start using them (the crutches) if I ever want to get out of this wheelchair.”  A “wheelchair” is a spe cial chair that has wheels – not too surprisingly!  It’s used by people who can’t walk easily or cannot walk at all because there is a problem with their legs.  Gail sa ys, “I don’t have the strength to stand up.”  She’s saying I’m not strong enou gh to stand up. “Strength” means the energy and ability to use your muscl es in a certain way; in this case, the muscles in her legs.

Mike says, “You’ll get the hang of it.”  “To get the ha ng of (something)” means to learn to do something so that it becomes normal, easy for you, to be able to do something without having to think about it or put a lo t of effort into it.  If you drive a new car or you get a new piece of computer software, i t may take you a while to get the hang of it – to get used to it, to do it well.  Mike says, “Don’t lose heart.” This expression, “to lose heart,” means to give up, to thi nk that you will never be able to do something.  Mike says, “Do not lose heart,” m eaning don’t give up.

Gail says, “It should be easy now that my arm is out of the  cast, but it just seems impossible.”  A “cast” (cast) here means a piece of plaster , which is a heavy, hard, white material that is put around a part of you r body so that it won’t move. If you break your arm or your leg, they will usually put this big white cast on your leg or your arm so that you don’t move it.  This allows t he body to get better – to heal.  “Cast” has a number of different meanings in En glish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gail says, “I feel I’m going to lose my balance each time  I stand up.”  “To lose your balance” means to fall over or to start to fall over , perhaps because you are “dizzy,” meaning you feel somehow that your head is moving  around and your body begins to become unsteady.  Little boys, for example,  sometimes like to

 turn around and around and around, if they do that too much, they get dizzy and they may lose their balance – they may fall down.

Gail says that she feels like she’s going to lose her bala nce each time she tries to stand up.  Mike says, “Try again, and this time lean on me .”  “To lean (lean) on (someone)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to support  yourself against another person or thing, especially when you are stand ing.  So for example if you hurt your leg, you may stand up and then lean on anoth er person, put your arm or put your body against that person so that that person  can help you stay standing so you won’t fall down.  That’s the most common  definition; there’s another meaning of this phrase, “to lean on (someone) .”  It can also mean to apply pressure, force, or perhaps even a threat to someon e in order to get them to do something.  It’s an expression you would probably he ar if you are talking about a crime gang that is trying to pressure someone i nto doing something, perhaps even something illegal.

Mike says, “I’ll try to serve as your legs until you can find  your balance.”  “To serve as (something)” means to act as something, especially wh en the other thing is not available, to take the place of something e lse.  For example, I have a big table that serves as my desk.  It’s not a desk, it wasn’t  designed to be a desk, it was made to be a table that you would sit and eat a t, but I use it as my desk.  It serves as – it takes the place of – it serves the function of my desk.  The verb “serve” has many different meanings in English however; p lease take a look at today’s Learning Guide for some additional explanation s.

Mike is telling Gail that he will help her stand up an d help her walk.  Gail says, “I wish I didn’t feel so utterly useless.”  The word “utter ly” (utterly) means completely, entirely, 100 percent.  It’s often used to d escribe some sort of negative emotion.  “I’m utterly exhausted today” means I ’m completely tired; I’m very, very tired.  In this case, Gail says she feels “utterly u seless,” meaning 100 percent useless, completely useless.  She says, “It’s so frustra ting (it’s so discouraging)!”

Mike says, “I know.  Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try.”  “To keep your eye on the ball” is an expression we use to mean  to focus on your goal or objective; don’t get distracted by other things; don’ t let other things bother you. If you are trying to win an Olympic gold medal, you need  to keep your eye on the ball – you need to continue to focus and concentrate o n something.  You might hear the expression “he took his eye off the ball,” meani ng he lost his focus, he didn’t pay attention to what he should of been paying attention.

 Mike says, “The next thing you know, you’ll be limping alon g and then running a marathon.”  The expression “the next thing you know” is use d to say that something will happen very quickly, much more quickly than y ou thought, much sooner than you thought.  So, sooner than you think, whi ch is another way of saying this, “you’ll be limping.”  “To limp” means to w alk in a way that puts very little weight on one foot or leg, usually because you’r e injured.  So if you hurt your right leg, you will be limping, you will not be usin g your right leg very much, and so you will walk a little funny.  Usually if you’re limpi ng, you’re moving a little more slowly as well.  A “marathon” is a long race for ru nners, approximately 26 miles.  It’s a very common kind of long distance run, a “m arathon.”  It comes originally from Greek history – ancient Greek history, but we won’t talk about that now.

Mike says, “It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back,” before you get your ability to move around in your body easily.  G ail says, “Yeah, right,” meaning she’s not really sure that’s true.  “Yeah, righ t” is often used as an expression when someone doesn’t think it’s true.  Even thou gh they are saying something that sounds like they’re agreeing, in many cases – in most cases it means that they don’t agree with that.  Gail says, “first  things first.”  We use this phrase to talk about the need to do things in order, o ne thing at a time.  You have to do the most important thing first, the thing that comes first in order.  She says, “Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate thi s time.”  She’s saying yes, maybe someday I will be able to run a marathon, bu t first I need be able to walk, so she needs to get her legs to work properly for he r.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
