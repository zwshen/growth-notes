Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1002 – An Unwelcome Business in the Neighborhood.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1002. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “An Unwelcome Business in the Neighborhood.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Finally! That empty building has a new te nant. That’s great for the neighborhood.

Francois: Think again. The new tenant plans to open  a strip club.

Patricia: A strip club in the middle of a residenti al neighborhood?! That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.

Francois: I’m not so sure. The tenant has already s tarted moving in, and there is no sign that the city is going take action.

Patricia: Then we have to do something to let the c ity know that we object to a strip club going into that space.

Francois: Good luck getting the city to do anything , much less file an injunction. The mayor is very pro-business, and it won’t look g ood if he tries to shut down any business that could bring revenue and jobs to t his dying town.

Patricia: But at what cost? Our kids will have to w alk past the strip club every day to and from school. That’s outrageous!

Francois: I suggest channeling that energy into act ion. If we make a stink and get media coverage, maybe we’ll get some action.

Patricia: Good idea. How can we get the local media  to cover a neighborhood protest?

Francois: How about nude picketing?

Patricia: I think that would send the wrong message .

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue for this episode is entitled “An Unwel come Businesses in the Neighborhood.” When we say a business or a person i s “unwelcome,” we mean they are not welcome. The prefix “-un” in English m eans “not.” To say someone is a “welcome visitor” or a “welcome business” mean s you want them there. You are happy that the person or the business is there.  So, if you have an unwelcome business, you have a business that you don’t want i n your neighborhood – the area where you live in your city or town.

Patricia begins our dialogue by saying, “Finally!” – at last! – “That empty building has a new tenant. That’s great for the neighborhood .” A “tenant” (tenant) is a business or a person who rents a certain house or b uilding. A tenant is someone who pays rent, who pays money, to usually live in o r work in a certain area. So, if you have an apartment, you will have to pay rent, a nd that makes you a tenant. Patricia is happy that the empty building near thei r house has a new tenant.

Francois doesn’t think this is good news. He says t o Patricia, “Think again.” Patricia says it’s great news, but Francois says, “ Think again.” “Think again” means you should consider this situation again. You  should think about it again. Usually, it means the other person is wrong. The co nclusion that the other person has reached is incorrect in your view.

So, if someone says to you, “Oh, I’m going to go to  Minnesota” – in the northern part of the U.S., where I’m from – “for a winter va cation. I’m going to bring my bathing suit and my sunglasses because I expect it will be very warm and sunny,” someone from Minnesota would say to you, “T hink again,” meaning you’re wrong. The way you are thinking is not corre ct, or you have reached an incorrect conclusion.

Francois says, “The new tenant plans to open a stri p club.” A “strip club” is a place where, typically, women take their clothes of f for men. Patricia says, “A strip club in the middle of a residential neighborh ood? That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.” Patric ia is surprised that this kind of

business – which of course you would not want near your house, if anywhere – is opening up in the middle of a residential neighborh ood.

A “neighborhood” is an area of a town or a city. “R esidential” (residential) refers to homes and apartments and condominiums. A “reside nt” is a person who lives in a certain area. “Residential” refers to an area where there are mostly houses and apartments. The opposite of “residential” is “c ommercial.” A commercial area has mostly businesses and stores, but residential a reas have mostly houses and apartments.

Patricia says that they can’t open this kind of bus iness in the middle of a residential neighborhood. She says, “That must be a  violation of city ordinances.” A “violation” is when you break the law or you brea k some rules. You don’t follow some regulation. That would be a violation. “Ordina nces” (ordinances) are laws, usually laws for a city or a town. It could be laws  for a county, I suppose, also. Normally, the word “ordinance” is used to refer to a law of a city or a town.

Patricia says, “The city won’t allow that.” The cit y won’t permit that. Francois says, “I’m not so sure. The tenant has already star ted moving in, and there is no sign that the city is going to take action.” Franco is says the tenant has already started “moving in.” The person has already started  to bring things into the building. He also says there is no sign, there is no indication, that the city – the government of the city – is going to take action. “ To take action” here means to do something.

Patricia says, “Then we have to do something to let  the city know that we object to a strip club going into that place.” “To object (object) to” something is to express your disagreement about something, to prote st about something, to let people know that you don’t like something.

If you watch a crime show in English, a television program about the law and courtrooms and judges, you will probably hear this word “object.” It’s something that the lawyers say when they don’t like what the other side has said or they don’t think what the other side has said should be part of the legal case. The lawyers will often stand up and say, “I object, You r Honor.” “Your Honor” here refers to the judge. Well, here we’re talking about  “objecting to” something – objecting to this business coming into the neighbor hood.

Francois says, “Good luck getting the city to do an ything.” When he says, “Good luck,” he’s not actually wishing Patricia good luck . What he’s really doing is indicating that what she wants will not happen, or that what she is hoping to happen probably won’t happen. Francois says, “Good luck getting the city to do

anything, much less file an injunction.” An “injunc tion” (injunction) is when the government, often the court, will tell someone or s ome business that they can’t do something. They stop someone from doing somethin g that they’ve believed to be illegal.

That’s what Francois is referring to here. He doesn ’t think the city is going to file an injunction. The verb “file” (file) here means si mply to try to get an injunction from a judge. An injunction has to come from a judg e, from a court. But the city government – the mayor or other people who work for  the city – can ask the judge to stop a business from doing something. That  would be “filing an injunction” – asking the judge to stop this person from doing something.

Francois says, “The mayor,” who is the leader of the city or town, “is very pro- business, and it won’t look good if he tries to shu t down any businesses that could bring revenue and jobs to this dying town.” T he mayor is very “pro- business.” When we say someone is “pro (pro) – some thing,” we mean they are in favor of, or they support, that thing.

So, someone who is “pro-business” is someone who is  in favor of business, who tries to help companies. Someone who is “pro-labor”  (labor) would be someone who is trying to help workers, especially labor uni ons. So, you’ll see that prefix “pro-” in front of a word when someone is in favor of that or supports that. The mayor is “pro-business,” Francois says, and it won’ t look good if he tries to “shut down” this business. “To shut down” is a two-word p hrasal verb meaning “to close.”

The mayor is interested in the “revenue and jobs” t hat the business can bring to this dying town. “Revenue” (revenue) refers to mone y, specifically taxes that the business will pay the city. Patricia says, “But at what cost? Our kids will have to walk past the strip club every day to and from scho ol. That’s outrageous!” “Outrageous” means that’s crazy. That’s a terrible thing.

Francois says, “I suggest channeling that energy in to action.” “To channel (channel) your energy into” something means to put your energy into something. “To channel” anything means to take it and use it f or a specific purpose. He continues, “If we make a stink and get media covera ge, maybe we’ll get some action.” “To make a stink” (stink) is an interestin g expression. It means to create problems so that other people notice that you don’t  like something. You complain or you do something to get attention so that other people will realize that you’re not happy and, you hope, do something about it.

“Media coverage” refers to newspapers, television s tations, radio stations, magazines, or Internet websites talking about your issue or talking about you. Media coverage is when the press, the media – the n ewspapers and television stations – talk about your story. They tell other p eople about what you are doing. Patricia says, “Good idea,” meaning that’s a good i dea; we should make a stink.

“How do we get the local media to cover a neighborh ood protest?” Patricia is thinking of an idea to get the local media – the ne wspapers and television stations in that town or city – “to cover,” that is  to report on, the neighborhood protest. A “protest” is when you get together in pu blic to indicate your belief about something, often your unhappiness about something.

Now remember, they’re protesting a strip club, a pl ace where usually men pay money to see women take their clothes off. So, Fran cois suggests “nude picketing.” “To picket” (picket) means to walk back  and forth on the sidewalk with signs in the air that indicate what you are angry a bout, what you are protesting about. “Nude” (nude) means without any clothing on.

Francois is suggesting that they could get attentio n from the local media if they picketed without wearing any clothing. Of course, t hey’re nude because that’s of course the kind of business that a strip club is. S o, they are calling attention to this issue. Patricia says, however, “I think that w ould send the wrong message.” The expression “to send the wrong message” means yo u are doing something that will give people the wrong idea about what you  want or what you are trying to accomplish.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia: Finally! That empty building has a new te nant. That’s great for the neighborhood.

Francois: Think again. The new tenant plans to open  a strip club.

Patricia: A strip club in the middle of a residenti al neighborhood?! That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.

This episode is a dialogue between Kathryn and Mart in about describing how long things are. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kathryn: Are you still watching that movie? It’s be en over three hours!

Martin: Yeah, it’s a little long for a feature film .

Kathryn: A little long?! It’s interminable. How can  you continue to watch it?

Martin: Well, the first half was interesting and mo ved at a clip. The middle section did drag a little, but it’s picked up again. It’s n early over.

Kathryn: I would’ve turned it off long before this.  I like movies that are short and sweet. After about 90 minutes, my mind starts to wa nder, and after two hours, I check out.

Martin: It depends on the movie. Sometimes I watch a movie and it’s so engrossing that time zips by. With other movies, th ough, time moves at a snail’s pace. This movie is somewhere in between.

Kathryn: Hey, the credits are rolling. You missed t he ending.

Martin: No big loss. I knew how it was going to end  after the first hour.

Kathryn: Then why did you stick it out and watch the rest of the movie?

Martin: One word: procrastination.

 Kathryn: Ah, enough said.

[end of dialogue]

Kathryn begins the dialogue by asking Martin, “Are you still watching that movie? It’s been over three hours!” Martin says, “Yeah, it ’s a little long for a feature film.” A “feature (feature) film” is a regular movie – the  kind of movie you would go to a movie theater to see. Feature films are normally be tween 90 and perhaps 200 minutes. It depends on the movie, but somewhere bet ween an hour and a half and two and a half hours, though sometimes movies a re longer than that.

Kathryn says, “A little long?! It’s interminable.” Kathryn thinks this movie, which has been going for more than three hours now, is no t just a little long – it’s really long. In fact, she calls it “interminable” (intermi nable). Something that is interminable goes on forever, or it seems to never end. I’ve been on some dates like that – when you go out with someone romantical ly, and the evening isn’t going very well, and then it seems interminable, li ke it’s never going to end. It does end eventually, however.

Kathryn says, “How can you continue to watch it?” H ow can you continue to watch this long movie? Martin says, “Well, the firs t half” – meaning the first 50 percent of the movie – “was interesting and moved a t a clip.” “To move at a clip” (clip), or “to move along at a clip,” means to adva nce very quickly, to move very rapidly. If a movie is moving quickly, a lot of thi ngs are happening in the movie.

The middle section of the movie, according to Marti n, “did drag a little, but it’s picked up again.” “To drag” (drag) means to go very  slowly, too slowly – so slow that it is a little boring. Martin says the movie h as “picked up again.” “To pick (pick) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to increase in  speed, to start to go faster. Martin says the movie is “nearly over,” meaning it’ s almost over. “It’s nearly (nearly) over.”

Kathryn says, “I would’ve turned it off long before  this.” Kathryn means that if she had been watching the movie, she would have turned the movie off a long time ago. She would not have continued watching it for t his long. She says, “I like movies that are short and sweet.” The expression “t o be short and sweet” means to not take very long and to be pleasant. Usually w e use this expression “short and sweet” when we want someone to get to the point  right away, or to not go on for very long. “Let’s keep this short and sweet,” m eaning let’s do this very quickly and not waste a lot of time.

Kathryn says, “After about 90 minutes, my mind star ts to wander, and after two hours, I check out.” If you say your mind “starts t o wander” (wander), you mean that you cannot concentrate or focus on something. Your mind begins to think of other things. If you are sitting in a meeting at wo rk, and the person who’s speaking is very boring or is going on for a very l ong time, your mind might start to wander. You might start thinking about what you’ re going to have for dinner that night or where you’re going to go on vacation next summer. You’re not focusing or concentrating on what you are supposed to be focusing on.

Kathryn says after two hours of watching a movie, s he checks out. “To check (check) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop paying attention to something, to no longer focus on what you’re suppos ed to focus on. Martin says, for him, “It depends on the movie. Sometimes I watc h a movie and it’s so engrossing that time zips by.” “To be engrossing” ( engrossing) means to be very interesting, to be so interesting that you can’t fo cus on anything else. If you’re reading an engrossing novel, you don’t want to put it down.

Often, when you are really interested in something,  you go into what psychologists sometimes described as a “state of fl ow” (flow). “To be in flow” means to be so completely focused and concentrated on something that you don’t realize how much time you’re spending on it. That’s why Martin says that if the movie is engrossing, “time zips by.” “To zip (z ip) by” means to go very quickly. A more common expression would be “time fl ies.” There’s an expression, “Time flies when you’re having fun,” and that’s exa ctly what we’re talking about here.

Martin says, “With other movies, though, time moves  at a snail’s pace.” The opposite of time flying by or zipping by is for it to move at a “snail’s (snail’s) pace (pace).” The “pace” of something is how fast or slo w it’s going. A “snail” is a small animal that moves very, very slowly. If you say som ething is moving at a “snail’s pace,” you mean it is moving very slowly.

Martin says this movie – the movie he’s watching no w – is somewhere in between. If something is “somewhere in between,” it  is in the middle. It is not at one end or the other. In this case, it isn’t moving  very quickly, but it isn’t moving very slowly, either. Kathryn says, “Hey, the credit s are rolling.” At the end of a movie, there are typically a few minutes where they  tell you who participated in the movie – who the actors were, who the director w as, and so forth. These are called the “credits” (credits). To say “the credits  are rolling” means the credits are showing on the screen.

Kathryn says, “You missed the ending.” The “ending”  is the very end of the movie. Martin doesn’t seem too concerned. He says, “No big loss.” That expression, “no big loss,” is an informal one that means that it isn’t a very important. You don’t need to worry about it. Martin  says, “I knew how it” – the movie – “was going to end after the first hour.” Ka thryn asks, “Then why did you stick it out and watch the rest of the movie?” “To stick something out” is a phrasal verb meaning to not give up, to continue doing some thing even though it might be difficult.

Kathryn wants to know why, if Martin knew the end of the movie after the first hour, he continued to watch it. Martin says, “One w ord: procrastination.” “Procrastination” (procrastination) is when you wai t to do something later instead of doing it now. We might also use the phrasal verb  “to put off” something. “Never do today what you can put off until tomorrow.” That  means don’t do anything today that you can wait and do tomorrow. To wait to  do things – usually because you’re lazy or you don’t want to work very hard – i s called “procrastination.”

Kathryn understands completely what Martin is sayin g here. She says, “Ah, enough said.” When you say, “enough said,” you’re i ndicating that you understand completely what the other person is tell ing you, so much so that the other person doesn’t have to finish explaining it. You already understand what they’re saying. You’re saying to the person, “You d on’t need to say any more. You don’t need to explain anything else. I understa nd it. I get it.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kathryn: Are you still watching that movie? It’s be en over three hours!

Martin: Yeah, it’s a little long for a feature film .

Kathryn: A little long?! It’s interminable. How can  you continue to watch it?

Martin: Well, the first half was interesting and mo ved at a clip. The middle section did drag a little, but it’s picked up again. It’s n early over.

# Being Modest and Boastful

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1004 – Being Modest and Boastful.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1004. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Technically, it’s http:/ /www.eslpod.com, just in case you were confused. What you shouldn’t be confused a bout is the Learning Guide. There is a Learning Guide for all of our cur rent episodes, and you can get them by becoming a member of ESL Podcast on our web site.

This episode is a dialogue between Hans and Freddie  about being modest and boastful. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hans: Well, I think the choice is clear. I think we  should hire Clark.

Freddie: To me, the choice is clear, too, but I thi nk that choice is Paul. Both Paul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a  blowhard. He was too full of himself.

Hans: Clark may come off as a little overconfident,  but he makes a good impression. He would make a much better rep than Pa ul. Paul was just too low- key and timid.

Freddie: Paul wasn’t timid at all. He was modest an d self-deprecating, but he also had a quiet confidence. He wasn’t trying too h ard to impress, like Clark was.

Hans: Clark is the kind of person who stands out in  a room and gets noticed. That’s what we want in a rep trying to get new clie nts.

Freddie: I found Clark to be overbearing. Paul, on the other hand, had a way with him. He exuded confidence without having to resort to blowing his own horn.

Hans: I see we’re at loggerheads about this. What d o you suggest?

Freddie: Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Moniq ue to join us. She’s done a lot of hiring and has good judgment.

 Hans: You mean you want Monique to make the call so  neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.

Freddie: I always thought you were quick on the upt ake.

[end of dialogue

Our dialogue begins with Hans saying to Freddie, “W ell, I think the choice is clear” – I think the person we should pick is obvio us. “I think we should hire Clark.” “To hire” (hire) means to give the job to s omeone. Hans thinks they should give the job to Clark. Hans is talking with Freddie. Normally, when you hear the name “Freddie” in English, you think of a boy or a man. “Fred” (Fred) is definitely a man’s name, but some women with names like Frederica might use – as a nickname, or short name – “Freddie,” and that’ s the case here.

Freddie says, “To me, the choice is clear too, but I think that choice is Paul.” Freddie doesn’t agree with Hans. She says, “Both Pa ul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a blowhard.” A “blowhard”  (blowhard) – one word – is someone who likes to talk a lot, but who’s very arr ogant and who likes to, we would use the verb, “boast” (boast). “To boast” mea ns to talk about how great you are, how wonderful you are.

Normally the word “blowhard” is an adjective used t o describe someone who talks too much, and often in an arrogant way. It’s definitely an insulting term. You would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to call yo ur boss a blowhard, at least not when your boss is listening. Freddie thinks Clark i s a blowhard. She says, “He was too full of himself.” “To be full of yourself” means to think that you are better than other people. It means that you think you are wonderful, great, better than the other people around you.

Hans says, “Clark may come off as a little overconf ident, but he makes a good impression.” “To come off as” something means to gi ve the impression of being a certain way – to do or say things that give people a certain idea about who you are. If someone “comes off as friendly,” he or she is acting in a way that makes you think that he or she is friendly. Hans says tha t Clark comes off as “a little overconfident.” The prefix “over-” (over) usually m eans too much. “Overconfident” would describe a person who thinks he’s better than  he really is.

Hans, however, thinks Clark “makes a good impressio n,” meaning he is a good person perhaps to represent the company. He says, “ He would make a much better rep than Paul.” A “rep” (rep) is a represent ative, often someone who is

selling something for the company, selling services  or products for the company. Your rep is often the same as your salesperson, but  not always. Sometimes your rep in a company is merely the person who you conta ct if you have problems.

Hans says, “Paul is just too low-key and timid.” “T o be low-key” (key) means to be calm, to be quiet, to be very relaxed – maybe a little too relaxed. “Timid” (timid) is someone who is shy, who doesn’t seem to have a lot of confidence. To describe someone as “low-key” is not necessarily to  criticize him or her. However, “timid” is definitely a more negative way of describing a person, especially someone in a business environment. You d on’t want someone representing your company to be timid. You don’t wa nt them to be shy. You don’t want them to show a lack of confidence.

Freddie disagrees. She says, “Paul wasn’t timid at all,” meaning he wasn’t timid even a little bit. “He was modest and self-deprecat ing,” but he also has “a quiet confidence.” “To be modest” (modest) means to be hu mble – not to talk about how great you are, or think that you are more impor tant than everyone else. “Self (self) – deprecating (deprecating)” means critical of yourself, often in a funny way. Someone who is self-deprecating is someone who  makes fun of himself, who doesn’t think that he is very important or more  important than the people around him. We like people who are self-deprecating  and modest, who don’t think that they are better than the rest of us.

Freddie says that Paul has a “quiet confidence.” the term “quiet (quiet) confidence” is used to describe someone who realize s they – he or she – has abilities, but doesn’t brag about it. If you say th is woman has a quiet confidence, you mean she knows that she can do the job. She’s c onfident she can do the job, but she doesn’t brag about it. She doesn’t boast ab out it. “To brag” (brag) means the same as to boast – to tell people how important  you are, how good you are at something.

Freddie says, “Paul wasn’t trying too hard to impre ss.” “To try too hard” at something means to be doing it too much. “To impres s” (impress) means to try to get other people to think that you are good, to try  to get other people to have a good opinion of you. Hans says that “Clark is the k ind of person who stands out in a room and gets noticed.” If you “stand out,” yo u are someone who other people notice, other people see, especially in a go od way.

We may talk about a “standout student,” using the e xpression “standout” as an adjective. A “standout student” would be a student who does better than any of the other students in the class. “To stand out” as a verb means to act in such a way that other people notice how good you are. Some times you can stand out in

a bad way, I suppose. There’s an expression in Engl ish, “He stands out like a sore (sore) thumb.” “To stand out like a sore thumb ” means to be very noticeable, but in a bad way.

Here, however, Hans is using it in a good way to de scribe Clark. He says, “That’s what we want in a rep to get new clients.” So, now we see the rep more as a salesman, because Hans wants the rep to get new cli ents. “Clients” (clients) are customers, usually customers that you have for some  service you provide.

Freddie disagrees. Freddie says, “I found Clark to be overbearing.” Someone who is “overbearing” (overbearing) is someone who i s perhaps a little bit too aggressive or too forceful in a situation. Someone who is “overbearing” would be someone who talks a lot and perhaps doesn’t let you  talk, or gives their opinions a little bit too strongly in such a way that no one  else really wants to talk with this person in the room.

Freddie says, “Paul, on the other hand, had a way w ith him.” This is an expression you might use when you’re not quite sure  why you like someone, but you like the way they act. You like the things they  do. Freddie says that Paul “exuded confidence without having to resort to blow ing his own horn.” “To exude” (exude) means to display some quality or some emoti on. “To exude confidence” means to show other people that you are confident.

“To resort to” something means to have to do someth ing even though you don’t really want to, but you think it’s necessary in ord er to accomplish what you want to get done. “I don’t want to resort to violence.” That means I don’t want to have to use violence. We always use “to resort to” for a ctions that you don’t want to do, but you may think necessary.

Freddie says Paul doesn’t have to resort to “blowin g his own horn.” “To blow (blow) your own horn (horn)” means to brag or to bo ast – to say good things about yourself. Hans and Freddie don’t agree. Hans says, “I see we’re at loggerheads about this.” “To be at loggerheads” (lo ggerheads) means to be in a disagreement in such a way that you don’t think you ’re going to be able to solve the problem or to come to an agreement.

Hans asks Freddie what she suggest they do. Freddie  says, “Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Monique to join us.” Freddie’s ide a is to have the two people come to lunch and have a third person from the comp any join them so that she can give her opinion. Freddie says, “Monique has do ne a lot of hiring and has good judgment.” “To have good judgment” means that you are good at deciding whether something is good or bad.

 Freddie’s solution is to ask Monique to go with the m to lunch and basically to have her make the decision. Hans understands what F reddie is doing here. He says, “You mean you want Monique to make the call s o neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.” “To make the call” means to make the decision, especially a difficult decision. Freddie is suggesting that Monique make the decision so that if it’s the wrong decision, Fr eddie and Hans won’t be blamed. That is, people won’t say it was their fault for hi ring this person.

Freddie says, “I always thought you were quick on t he uptake.” The phrase “to be quick on the uptake” (uptake) means to understand s omething very quickly, to be a fast learner. Freddie is saying that Hans has und erstood the reason for inviting Monique to lunch and making the decision for them v ery quickly. It is, of course, so that Freddie and Hans won’t get into trouble for  making the wrong decision.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hans: Well, I think the choice is clear. I think we  should hire Clark.

Freddie: To me, the choice is clear, too, but I thi nk that choice is Paul. Both Paul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a  blowhard. He was too full of himself.

Hans: Clark may come off as a little overconfident,  but he makes a good impression. He would make a much better rep than Pa ul. Paul was just too low- key and timid.

Freddie: Paul wasn’t timid at all. He was modest an d self-deprecating, but he also had a quiet confidence. He wasn’t trying too h ard to impress, like Clark was.

Hans: Clark is the kind of person who stands out in  a room and gets noticed. That’s what we want in a rep trying to get new clie nts.

Freddie: I found Clark to be overbearing. Paul, on the other hand, had a way with him. He exuded confidence without having to resort to blowing his own horn.

Hans: I see we’re at loggerheads about this. What d o you suggest?

Freddie: Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Moniq ue to join us. She’s done a lot of hiring and has good judgment.

 Hans: You mean you want Monique to make the call so  neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.

Freddie: I always thought you were quick on the upt ake.

This episode is a dialogue between Anton and Jenny about saying nice things to a person who invites you over to their house for so me party or event – the person we would call the “host.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: Jenny, you’ve outdone yourself. This is quit e a spread.

Jenny: Thank you. I’m glad you approve.

Anton: Approve? I think everything on this table lo oks exquisite and mouthwatering.

Jenny: That’s nice of you to say. I wanted everythi ng to be perfect.

Anton: You’ve surpassed all expectations. If this f ood tastes even half as good as it looks, you’ll wow every guest.

Jenny: If you don’t stop complimenting me, I won’t be able to stop blushing.

Anton: I’m only just beginning, because you’re a vi sion in that dress.

Jenny: Oh, this is nothing special.

Anton: Of course it’s special, but you could wear a  sack and look ravishing.

Jenny: Okay, now I know you’re buttering me up. Wha t gives?

Anton: Nothing, nothing at all. You’re so suspiciou s. I’m just giving you my candid opinion.

Jenny: If you say so. Where’s the camera you borrow ed from me for your trip? Did you bring it?

Anton: Ah, the camera. Did I mention how much I adm ire that necklace you’re wearing?

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Complimenting Your Ho st.” “To compliment” (compliment) means to say nice things about someone . “Oh, those are very beautiful shoes you have on,” or “That’s a really n ice haircut.” Those are compliments – when you say something nice about som eone, or someone’s house, or someone’s car, or something that person o wns. You might even compliment someone’s children: “What a very smart y oung son you have.”

A “host” (host) is a person who has some party or s ome event, and is responsible for running the event and usually talking to people  and welcoming them to this party or event. You could also have a host just for  a dinner at your house. You may have five or six of your friends over. You woul d be the host of the party, or the host of the dinner.

The host isn’t always the person who organizes the event, but for a dinner or a small party it typically would be. Technically, the  host is the person who is there to greet people as they come in – to talk to them, to make them feel welcome. We use the word “host” also in talking about televi sion, radio, or podcasting. The person who is running the program, the person who i s in front of the microphone, we might say, or in front of the camera – he or she  is the host of the program.

Anton begins the dialogue by saying to Jenny, “You’ ve outdone yourself. This is quite a spread.” “To outdo yourself” means to do be tter than anyone expected you to do, to do better even than you expected to d o. Anton says, “This is quite a spread” (spread). A “spread” is when you have a lot  of food placed on a table. To say “it’s quite a spread” means there’s a lot of fo od or a lot of very good food there. Jenny says, “Thank you. I’m glad you approve .” I’m glad you think so. Anton says, “Approve? I think everything on this ta ble looks exquisite and mouthwatering.”

These are both adjectives we might use to describe good food. The first is “exquisite” (exquisite). Something that is exquisit e is something that is very refined, something that is perhaps – when not talki ng about food, at least – elegant. Here it means it tastes really, really goo d. Similarly, the term “mouthwatering” refers to something that tastes ver y good. It’s very appetizing.

“Exquisite” is a more general adjective that can be  used in lots of different circumstances. “Mouthwatering,” however, refers spe cifically to food.

Jenny says, “That’s nice of you to say. I wanted ev erything to be perfect.” Anton says, “You’ve surpassed all expectations.” “To surp ass” (surpass) means to go beyond something. “To surpass all expectations” mea ns to do better than anyone expected you to do. It’s quite similar to the expre ssion we had earlier, “to outdo yourself.”

Anton says, “If this food tastes even half as good as it looks, you’ll wow every guest.” Anton is saying that the food looks wonderf ul. If it tastes as good as it looks – or even half as good as it looks – “you’ll wow every guest.” “To wow” (wow) is an informal verb meaning to really impress  or surprise someone. “We’re going to wow our clients” – we’re going to make the m think this is wonderful. “Wow” is also what we would call an “interjection.”  When we see something very surprising, whether it’s good or bad, we’ll often s ay, “Wow.”

I once brought my computer in to be fixed, and the person looking at it was looking at the computer, and about every 30 seconds  or so she said wow. “Wow.” Now, that’s not what you want someone who’s fixing your computer to say, because she’s very surprised at something, and  if the computer is broken, it means she’s surprised at something that’s very bad.  And that’s not the kind of thing you want to hear. But “wow” is often used in a positive way to mean that you are surprised at a good thing. Here it’s defini tely used, as a verb, to mean make a positive impression on people.

Jenny says, “If you don’t stop complimenting me, I won’t be able to stop blushing.” “To blush” (blush) means for your cheeks , your face, to become pink or red because you’re embarrassed. That’s the idea of blushing. You blush when someone says something you find embarrassing. Some people, when you compliment them a lot, may blush. They may blush be cause they think you are being too kind – too nice, perhaps.

Anton says, “I’m only just beginning, because you’r e a vision in that dress.” Now Anton goes from complimenting her food to complemen ting her. He says, “You’re a vision in that dress.” If you describe someone as  a vision, you’re describing them as a beautiful person, someone who has a wonde rful appearance, we might say.

Jenny says, “Oh,” this is “nothing special.” Anton says, disagreeing with her, “Of course it’s special, but you could wear a sack and look ravishing.” A “sack” (sack) is like a bag that you would carry something in, ma de of paper or perhaps cloth.

Anton is saying here that even if Jenny was just we aring something ugly – something that isn’t even clothing, like a sack – s he would still look ravishing. “Ravishing” (ravishing) means very beautiful. It’s often used to describe a woman who is very beautiful, very attractive.

Jenny says, “Okay, now I know you’re buttering me u p.” “To butter (butter) someone up” is a phrasal verb meaning to say nice t hings to someone because you want that person to do something for you. Jenny  thinks Anton is buttering her up because he wants something from her. So, she ask s him, “What gives?” This is an informal phrase we use when you want to know what is really happening when someone doesn’t seem to be straightforward wit h you, when someone doesn’t seem to be direct with you. You may say, “W hat gives?” What’s really going on here?

Anton says, “Nothing, nothing at all. You’re so sus picious.” “To be suspicious” (suspicious) means to be distrustful, to not believ e or not trust someone. Anton says, “I’m just giving you my candid opinion.” “Can did” (candid) means truthful, honest, not deceptive. There was a television show on for many years called Candid Camera . There, “candid” referred more to not prepared, no t posed. Candid Camera  was actually a secret camera that they would put s omewhere, and then the person who was the host of the show wo uld do something crazy, or have people do something crazy, and then see how pe ople reacted.

“Candid” when used in talking about photographs mea ns that you’re not stopping and looking at the camera and trying to look a cert ain way. It’s when someone takes photographs of people who are not often aware  that someone is taking a photograph of them. That would be a “candid.” Here,  however, it means really honest. When we talk about giving our “candid opini on,” we’re talking about giving our honest opinion.

Jenny says, “If you say so.” She doesn’t really bel ieve Anton. “Where’s the camera you borrowed from me for your trip? Did you bring it?” Now we learn that Anton had borrowed a camera from Jenny, and maybe s omething happened to the camera and Anton doesn’t have it anymore. That’ s what Jenny thinks. Anton says, “Ah, the camera.” Then he changes the subject . “Did I mention how much I admire that necklace you’re wearing?” “To admire” ( admire) means to really like something, to really approve of something, to think  that it’s great.

Anton admires her necklace – the thing she’s wearin g around her neck, a piece of jewelry she’s wearing around her neck. He, of co urse, is trying to change the subject because Jenny is probably right. Something happened to the camera,

and that’s why Anton is being so nice to Jenny – so  Jenny won’t be mad at him for losing or perhaps  damaging her camera.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: Jenny, you’ve outdone yourself. This is quit e a spread.

Jenny: Thank you. I’m glad you approve.

Anton: Approve? I think everything on this table lo oks exquisite and mouthwatering.

Jenny: That’s nice of you to say. I wanted everythi ng to be perfect.

Anton: You’ve surpassed all expectations. If this f ood tastes even half as good as it looks, you’ll wow every guest.

Jenny: If you don’t stop complimenting me, I won’t be able to stop blushing.

# Taking a Campus Tour

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1006 – Taking a Campus Tour.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1006. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is about a student visiting a college to determine if she wants to go there, and in order to do that, she takes a campus tour. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ji Won: Come on, Dad, the campus tour starts over t here. The guide is ready to begin the walking tour.

Guide: Welcome, prospective students and your paren ts. My name is Jaime and I’ll be conducting your tour today. This tour will last about an hour, and we’ll be making frequent stops so I can point out some of the most important buildings and areas on this campus.

Ji Won: Dad, are you listening?

Guide: First, let’s stop on the quad. On your left,  you’ll see the administration building. On your right are the student union and b ookstore. Let’s continue.

Ji Won: Dad, stop checking your email. You promised  that you’d make these campus visits with me and help me make a decision a bout which university to attend.

Guide: We’re passing the sports stadium on your lef t and the arts complex on your right. Those buildings there are the dorms. the research library is just ahead.

Ji Won: Dad, where did you go?

Guide: Let’s stop here a moment so I can point out the science buildings and research labs. Is something the matter?

 Ji Won: I think I’ve lost my dad. I think we’ll hav e to take the self-guided tour!

[end of dialogue]

Our episode begins with Ji Won saying to her father , “Come on, Dad, the campus tour starts over there.” “Come on” means “hurry up. ” When you are telling someone to move faster or to come with you, you mig ht use this expression, “Come on.” The word “campus” (campus) refers to the  physical location of a university. The buildings of a university are locat ed on a campus.

Sometimes we use that word “campus” nowadays when we’re talking about a large company or corporation that may have many dif ferent buildings located all on the same property, all in the same area. Sometim es those buildings or that collection of buildings is called a “campus,” but t he most common use of the word “campus” is to refer to a college or university cam pus. Sometimes we also refer to the place where you find high schools and school s for younger children “campuses” as well.

This student is taking a “campus tour,” where she i s going to go with someone from the university who is going to tell her about the university and the different buildings that they have there at the university. T he person that leads the tour is called a “guide” (guide). Ji Won says, “The guide i s ready to begin the walking tour.” A “walking tour” would be, of course, a tour  that has you walking around the campus. My guess is most campus tours are walki ng tours. If you’re taking a tour of the city, that would probably be a “bus tou r.”

The guide begins by saying, “Welcome prospective st udents and your parents.” A “prospective (prospective) student” would be a st udent who is thinking about attending this university. The word “prospective” h ere refers to something that might happen in the future. You might be a student at this university, so we will call you a “prospective student.” The guide’s name is Jaime. He says, “My name is Jaime and I’ll be conducting your tour today.” “ To conduct a tour” is to lead a tour, to be the leader of a tour.

“This tour will last,” or will take, “about an hour , and we’ll be making frequent stops so I can point out some of the most important  buildings and areas on this campus.” When Jaime says the group will be making f requent stops, he means they will be pausing or stopping to talk and look a t something in particular. Instead of walking the entire hour, the group will walk maybe five minutes, stop, talk a little, then walk another five minutes, and so forth.

The guide is going to “point out some of the most i mportant buildings and areas on this campus.” “To point out” is a very common tw o-word phrasal verb meaning to indicate something, to draw someone’s attention to something important. If you are on any kind of tour and you have a tour guide, the guide will typically mention important things as you go by them, either driving by them or walking by them. “To point out” is to indicate. The guide will be po inting out “the most important buildings and areas on the campus.”

Ji Won says to her father, “Dad, are you listening? ” Apparently, her father is not paying attention. I should mention that typically t hese tours are offered to high school students who are thinking of attending that particular university. Universities and colleges, just like any other sort  of business, need to get customers. They need students to come to their univ ersity. So, some parents take their children to these universities so that t he children, the teenagers, can get a better idea about the university, and the par ents can get a better idea about where they are sending their child.

I never took a campus tour. I didn’t have a lot of choices about the university that I was going to attend, and this wasn’t a very commo n practice, at least when I was in high school, at least for the students that I went to high school with. I did have some friends who went to other universities in  a different part of the country that took campus tours, but it’s often the more wea lthy families that are able to afford – that have enough money – to travel to diff erent parts of the country to take these campus tours. But back to our story . . .

The guide says, “First, let’s stop on the quad.” So , we’re taking a tour of the campus, and the first place the guide takes this gr oup is the “quad” (quad). The quad is an area in the central part of campus that is in the shape of a square or a rectangle. “Quad” is short for “quadrangle.” Usuall y, this is an area with grass in the middle of the campus that has the most importan t buildings around it, or some of the larger buildings around it.

A lot of campuses in the U.S. were built, and are b uilt, with this idea of having a central area, a central square, that students can g ather in and that can be a place for students and faculty (that is, the profes sors) to go and sit in – well, you know, waste time, which is what most students do at  the university. The guide takes them to the quad and then points out differen t buildings that are around the quad.

He says, “On your left, you’ll see the administrati on building.” An “administration building” is the building where the president of the university and the people who are running the university work, or at least have o ffices. The “administration

building” in many campuses is a large building wher e the secretaries and the administrators, the managers of the university, wor k.

Administration buildings don’t typically have profe ssors or teachers in them. There are other buildings that have offices for the  professors who teach at the university. Many large universities have more than one administration building. The guide points out the “student union” and the “b ookstore” to the tour group. The “student union” (union) is a building for stude nts that typically has a restaurant or a café, places for students to have m eetings, offices for student organizations, and places for students to have even ts, activities.

When I went to the University of Minnesota, we had a student union that had a place for large meetings or dances on the weekends.  The student union had places to eat. It had offices for the student organ izations – all of these things could be found in the student union. It’s a place f or students to go before or after their classes to talk and to do other sorts of acti vities on campus.

The “bookstore” is the place where you can buy the very expensive books that are used at the university for the classes. Ji Won says to her father, “Dad, stop checking your email.” Her father is apparently look ing at his phone and checking his email. She says, “You promised that you’d make these campus visits with me and help me make a decision about which university to attend.” Ji Won then gives us the main reason why you take a campus tour , which is to decide if you want to go to that college or university.

The tour guide continues with the tour. He points o ut four other areas on the campus. The first is the “sports stadium.” A sports  stadium would be a large building, inside of which you play sports. Often sp orts stadiums are what we would call “open air” stadiums, so that the buildin g is sort of in a circle, and you play the sport in the middle, but there’s no roof. There is no top that goes over the place where you play the sport.

So, you can have a football stadium. You could have  a baseball stadium. You could have a soccer stadium. More typically, you wo uld just have one big stadium in which you would play all of these differ ent sports. Basketball would of course have to be played inside, so the stadium for  the basketball team would have to be a normal building with a roof on top.

The “arts complex” is a group of buildings where the university has their art classes. “Dorms” (dorms) are places where the stude nts sleep. These are like apartments for the students. Typically, dorms have rooms for the students, but there aren’t any kitchens or cooking areas inside of the rooms. Typically, if you

are staying in a university dorm, you eat downstair s in a cafeteria or a place where they have food for you to eat. The guide also  points out the “research library.” A “library,” as you probably know, is a p lace where you can go and get books.

In some large universities, such as the University of Minnesota, the University of Southern California, the University of California a t Los Angeles, there is more than one library. Often, there’ll be a library that  is especially designed for the professors and graduate students doing research. An d so, in that library you will have things like professional journals – scientific  magazines, if you will – for the professors to look at and the graduate students to look at. That’s what the guide is referring to here.

Ji Won says to her father, “Where did you go?” She doesn’t know what happened to her father, who obviously is not paying attentio n. The guide then says, “Let’s stop here a moment so I can point out the science b uildings and research labs.” The “research labs,” or “laboratories,” are places where the university has its science classes and where professors do their scien tific experiments.

The guide says to Ji Won, “Is something the matter? ” That phrase, “something the matter” (matter), refers to a problem – somethi ng that is unusual, something that is bad, something that has gone wrong. If some one asks you, “Is something the matter?” they mean, “Is there something wrong?”  “Is there a problem?” Ji Won says, “I think I’ve lost my dad. I think we’ll have to take the self-guided tour.”

A “self-guided tour” would be a tour in which you d o not have a guide. You do not have a leader. You have to go on your own and look at the different things. Ji Won thinks that she’ll have to take the self-guided  tour because she has to go and find her father, and of course, that would mean  leaving the guided tour that she is on now.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ji Won: Come on, Dad, the campus tour starts over t here. The guide is ready to begin the walking tour.

Guide: Welcome, prospective students and your paren ts. My name is Jaime and I’ll be conducting your tour today. This tour will last about an hour, and we’ll be making frequent stops so I can point out some of the most important buildings and areas on this campus.

 Ji Won: Dad, are you listening?

Guide: First, let’s stop on the quad. On your left,  you’ll see the administration building. On your right are the student union and b ookstore. Let’s continue.

Ji Won: Dad, stop checking your email. You promised  that you’d make these campus visits with me and help me make a decision a bout which university to attend.

Guide: We’re passing the sports stadium on your lef t and the arts complex on your right. Those buildings there are the dorms. the research library is just ahead.

Ji Won: Dad, where did you go?

Guide: Let’s stop here a moment so I can point out the science buildings and research labs. Is something the matter?

Ji Won: I think I’ve lost my dad. I think we’ll hav e to take the self-guided tour!

[end of dialogue]

The most important thing to point out is the fact t hat this script was written by the wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Getting Mugged

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 1007 – Getting Mugged.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1007. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Download a Learning Guide for this episode, right after you become a member of ESL Podcast.

This episode is about a woman who gets mugged – som eone steals something from her. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: Stop thief!

Police Officer: What happened?

Vanessa: I just got mugged. That guy stole my purse , jewelry, camera – all of my valuables!

Police Officer: Were you wearing flashy jewelry and  carrying an expensive camera? Those are big enticements for muggers.

Vanessa: I didn’t have anything on that was flashy,  and I was minding my own business.

Police Officer: Well, you should never go out alone  at night, and if you have to, stay in well-lighted areas. Traveling on dim street s makes you a target for thieves.

Vanessa: Thanks for that insight.

Police Officer: Can you describe the person who mug ged you?

Vanessa: No, it happened in a flash. I didn’t get a  good look at his face, but I’m sure it was a man.

Police Officer: It’s a good thing you weren’t hurt.  You should probably learn self- defense in case it happens again.

Vanessa: Thanks a lot. I think I’ve had as much adv ice as I can take in one night. Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?

Police Officer: Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t  get your hopes up.

Vanessa: Believe me, I won’t. [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Vanessa yelling, “Stop thi ef!” A “thief” (thief) is a person who steals something from someone else. Vanessa use s an expression that you would use if you are, say, in a store or out on the  street and someone comes and steals something from you. In order to get the atte ntion of other people so that they will stop this thief or help you, you say, “St op thief!”

A police officer is somewhere near Vanessa, and he says to Vanessa, “What happened?” Vanessa says, “I just got mugged.” “To g et mugged” (mugged) is to be robbed, especially when you are on the street or  in a bus or in some public place. To get mugged usually means to have your wal let or purse stolen. Vanessa says, “That guy stole my purse, jewelry, ca mera – all of my valuables.”

A “purse” (purse) is sometimes called a “handbag.” It’s a small bag carried by a woman, typically, that is used to hold her money, h er makeup, her hairbrush, her identification, tonight’s dinner, a television – al l of these things will fit inside of a typical purse used by a woman. Well, maybe not a te levision. “This guy stole my purse,” Vanessa says. He also, or she also, stole h er jewelry and camera. “Jewelry” (jewelry) refers to things that you wear on your body, such as a necklace or a bracelet or rings or earrings.

Your “camera,” of course, is what you use to take p ictures with, photographs with. Vanessa says this thief stole all of her “val uables.” Your valuables are anything that costs money, that is expensive, that you own. We typically use this word in the plural – “valuables” – to refer to anyt hing that you own that someone could steal and that was worth a lot of money.

The police officer then asks Vanessa, “Were you wea ring flashy jewelry and carrying an expensive camera?” “Flashy” (flashy) re fers to something that gets a lot of attention, something that is expensive-looki ng. A lot of times you’ll see musicians, for example, wearing jewelry that is ver y noticeable, that you can see

very easily. We might describe this jewelry as bein g “flashy.” It’s expensive jewelry that you notice because it’s very easy to s ee.

The police officer is asking Vanessa if she was “we aring flashy jewelry and carrying an expensive camera.” He says, “Those are big enticements for muggers.” An “enticement” (enticement) is something  that will make someone want to do something, something that will motivate someone to do something. In this case, it will motivate a thief – a “mugger,” w hich is a person who mugs you – to steal whatever it is that you have.

Vanessa says, “I didn’t have anything on” – that is , I wasn’t wearing anything – “that was flashy, and I was minding my own business .” “To mind (mind) your own business” means to not be focusing on other people,  to be only worrying about yourself. Here, it probably means to not be botheri ng other people. “I’m minding my own business.” You may say this to someone as a command – “Mind your own business” – when the person is trying to ask yo u personal questions or get information from you that you don’t think are of an y concern to that person, that you don’t think that person should know.

Vanessa says she was minding her own business. The police officers says, “Well, you should never go out alone at night, and if you have to, stay in well- lighted areas.” “Well-lighted” refers to an area th at has a lot of streetlamps or an area that is not dark. The police officer is tellin g Vanessa she shouldn’t be out alone at night, which is probably good advice in mo st American cities.

The officer says, “Traveling on dim streets makes y ou a target for thieves.” “Dim” (dim) is the opposite of “well-lighted.” It means d ark, without a lot of light. A “target” (target) is the focus of your attention. I t could be a person or it could be a thing. Often, when we use the word “target,” we’re talking about attacking that thing or person. So, in a war, you may have a build ing as your target. You’re trying to blow up or destroy a building. That build ing is your target.

Here, the police officer is referring to a thief’s target – that is, the person that the thief is going to attack, the person the thief is g oing to steal from. Vanessa is not very happy with the police officer, who doesn’t see m to be helping her very much; rather, he seems to be just giving her some a dvice, and it seems to Vanessa that the advice is rather obvious – that sh e didn’t really need this advice from the police officer.

That’s why she says, “Thanks for that insight.” An “insight” (insight) is some understanding about something that is not obvious, but the way Vanessa says it, she’s indicating that it is obvious. The police off icer is telling her something that

he doesn’t need to tell her, because she already kn ows. Of course, the police officer might say, “Well, if you already know, then  why were you doing it?” But, back to our story . . .

The police officer then asks, “Can you describe the  person who mugged you?” Vanessa says, “No. It happened in a flash (flash).”  When we say something “happened in a flash,” we mean it happened very qui ckly – so quickly that you didn’t even realize what was happening until after it happened. Vanessa says, “I didn’t get a good look at his face,” although I gue ss she knows it’s a man. “But I’m sure it was a man” – and there she tells us.

The police officer says, “It’s a good thing you wer en’t hurt. You should probably learn self-defense in case it happens again.” “Self -defense” is the practice of using your body or something that you carry to defe nd yourself, to protect yourself against someone who attacks you, someone w ho is trying to hurt you. Once again, Vanessa thinks that this advice is some what obvious and not very helpful.

She says, “Thanks a lot,” but she says it in a way that indicates that she isn’t really thanking the officer. She’s telling the offi cer that this is not very helpful to her. She says, “I think I’ve had as much advice as I can take in one night.” “Advice” would be recommendations or suggestions th at someone gives you. She uses the expression “As much as I can take in o ne night,” meaning as much as I want to listen to, as much as I can handle. “I  don’t need any more advice,” she’s saying.

“Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?”  Vanessa is asking the police officer if he’s going to do anything to actually ca tch the thief. The police officers says, “Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t get your  hopes up.” “To file a report” means to fill out some paperwork – to fill out some form or to write a description of what happened – and give it, in this case, to the other police officers or to the police station.

In more general terms, the expression “to file a re port” is to officially inform someone, often a government official, of some certa in fact or some information that they should know about. Really, it means that the police officer isn’t going to do much of anything. He’s going to write up what ha ppened and give it to someone, but it probably won’t mean anything. It pr obably won’t lead to the police arresting the thief.

The police officer says to Vanessa, “Don’t get your  hopes up.” “To get your hopes up” means to begin to feel optimistic about s omething, to think that

something good is going to happen. Vanessa, however , knows that nothing good is going to happen, and that’s why she says to the police officer, “Believe me, I won’t.” “Believe me” is the same as “Trust me.” We use it in a circumstance like this, where you are trying to emphasize to the pers on that what you are saying is true.

What Vanessa is saying is that she won’t get her ho pes up. She knows the police officer isn’t really going to do anything to catch the thief. I was mugged once, not here in United States – in another country, many ye ars ago. Some thief came up – actually two thieves, on a public bus – and stole  my wallet, and I went to the police and they filed a report.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: Stop thief!

Police Officer: What happened?

Vanessa: I just got mugged. That guy stole my purse , jewelry, camera – all of my valuables!

Police Officer: Were you wearing flashy jewelry and  carrying an expensive camera? Those are big enticements for muggers.

Vanessa: I didn’t have anything on that was flashy,  and I was minding my own business.

Police Officer: Well, you should never go out alone  at night, and if you have to, stay in well-lighted areas. Traveling on dim street s makes you a target for thieves.

Vanessa: Thanks for that insight.

Police Officer: Can you describe the person who mug ged you?

Vanessa: No, it happened in a flash. I didn’t get a  good look at his face, but I’m sure it was a man.

Police Officer: It’s a good thing you weren’t hurt.  You should probably learn self- defense in case it happens again.

 Vanessa: Thanks a lot. I think I’ve had as much adv ice as I can take in one night. Are you going to do anything to find that mugger?

Police Officer: Sure, I’ll file a report, but don’t  get your hopes up.

Vanessa: Believe me, I won’t.

# Money Laundering

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1008 – Money Laundering.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1008. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Susanna and Clar k about someone who’s trying to do something illegal with money. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Susanna: What’s going on in the office next door? I  heard that the police shut down their business.

Clark: You heard right. The cops had long suspected  that the business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.

Susanna: Not legit?

Clark: Yeah, it was a front for money laundering. T he so-called services it offered were a sham. It was a way for people to send them d irty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.

Susanna: But who was involved?

Clark: I’m not sure, but I imagine they’re people w ho want to evade taxes or to circumvent certain laws or regulations. I wouldn’t be surprised if their clients were people with underworld connections.

Susanna: You mean organized crime?

Clark: Yeah, they’re probably drug lords, smugglers , and racketeers.

Susanna: Wow, and the people who helped them were w orking next door to us all that time.

Clark: And we didn’t know a thing about it. How awf ul.

Susanna: How exciting!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Susanna saying to Clark, “ What’s going on in the office next door?” The “office next door” would be the off ice that is right next to your office. We could also talk about the “house next do or” – literally, the next door that you would open if you went over a little bit f rom where you are now. We talk about our “next door neighbor” as the person or the  house that is immediately next to ours. Here, we’re talking about an “office next door.”

Susanna says, “I heard that the police shut down th eir business.” Clark says, “You’re right. The cops had long suspected that the  business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.” Clark says the police “s uspected.” “To suspect” (suspect) is to think that something is true, especially when  we’re talking about someone doing something wrong or committing a crime, althou gh it could be a situation that is not criminal.

You could say, “I suspect that my brother is not ve ry happy living in Minnesota.” I’m not sure. I don’t have proof of that. I don’t h ave a lot of “evidence,” we would say, of that, but I think it’s true. When the polic e suspect someone of something, usually they think that person has done something w rong, has done something against the law.

The “cops,” which is an informal term for the polic e, had “long suspected,” meaning they had suspected for a long time, “that t he business operating out of that office was not legit.” “Legit” (legit) is shor t for “legitimate” (legitimate). Something that is legitimate is something that is r eal, something that is valid – in this case, something that is legal. The business wa s doing things that weren’t legal.

Susanna says, “Not legit?” Clark says, “Yeah, it wa s a front for money laundering.” A “front” (front) is a business or org anization that doesn’t do what it says it does. It is established or created or start ed in order to hide some sort of illegal activity. So, you might have someone who op ens up a store, but the store isn’t really for selling food or selling clothing –  whatever the store sells. The store

is really there in order to do something else, some thing illegal. One thing that is illegal is “money laundering.”

“To launder” (launder) means to clean your clothes.  We talk about taking your clothes to a “laundromat,” which is a place that ha s washing machines and drying machines – or, simply, “dryers.” “Money laundering”  is when you take money that you got from doing something illegal and use it in a business that is legal so that the police won’t know where the money really came f rom. It looks like it came from this business, even though it was gotten from some sort of illegal activity.

For example, you may be selling drugs illegally and  making a lot of money selling these drugs. You don’t want the police to find out about where you got all this money, and you want to put the money in a bank or d o something with the money. So, you start a business that sells clothing . You invest the money that you got selling drugs into the clothing store, and then the clothing store makes money, and now suddenly the money has been laundere d.

You can say, “Well, the money came from my clothing  store,” and it looks “clean” – it looks like it came from a legal operation, whe n in fact it came from you selling drugs. That would be an example of money laundering . Clark says, “The so- called services it offered were a sham.” The expres sions “so-called” (called) means presumably. It’s a phrase we use to refer to something that isn’t really true, or where you have a name for something that i sn’t really accurate. So, in this case, the business was selling services, but t hey weren’t really services, and so Clark uses the term “so-called.”

For example, you could talk about giving money to a  government official in order to get the government official to do something for you. This is illegal. You could call it a gift, however. Someone would then refer t o that gift as your “so-called gift,” because it isn’t really a gift. It is, in fa ct, what we would call a “bribe” (bribe) – when you give money to a government official to d o something for you. In most countries, bribes are illegal, which does not mean they’re not common.

The business here offered certain services that wer en’t really services at all. These services are what Clark calls a “sham” (sham) . Something that is a sham is something that is fake, something that is false,  something that is not what it appears to be. Clark says, “It was a way for people  to send them dirty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.” “Dirty  money” would be money that you obtained or got from doing something illegal. “ To legitimize (legitimize) is to make legitimate – to make it seem as though in this  case it were legal.

Susanna asks, “But who was involved?” Clark says, “ I’m not sure, but I imagine” – I’m guessing – “they’re people who want to evade taxes or to circumvent certain laws or regulations.” “To evade” (evade) is  to avoid something. “To evade taxes” is to avoid paying money to the government t hat you have to pay them.

If you work in the United States, for example, you have to pay taxes to the U.S. government, a certain percentage of your money to t he government, so the government has money to waste on other things, No, I’m just joking. The government needs money. It just doesn’t always spen d the money very wisely, but back to our story . . .

Clark says that this front was used by people who wanted to evade taxes or to “circumvent certain laws or regulations.” “To circu mvent” (circumvent) means to go around something, but here it really means the s ame as “to evade.” It means to avoid doing something. Clark says, “I wouldn’t b e surprised if their clients were people with underworld connections.” The term “unde rworld” (underworld) refers to the world of criminals, the world of the illegal  activities by criminals.

Susanna says, “You mean organized crime?” “Organize d crime” refers to groups of criminals who organize, who have an organization  that is used to commit crimes. You may have organized crime involved in se lling drugs. There isn’t just one person who goes and finds drugs and sells them to another person. It’s usually part of an organization, and these organiza tions, as you probably know, can be very dangerous and very powerful.

Clark says, “Yeah, they’re probably drug lords, smu gglers and racketeers.” The term “drug lord” refers to a very powerful person w ho is involved in this organization, in organized crime, selling drugs. A “smuggler” (smuggler) is a person who brings things into a country illegally, against the law. If you are smuggling in drugs to the United States, you are br inging these illegal drugs in here without permission.

A “racketeer” (racketeer) is a person who is involv ed in illegal business activities, often involving some sort of violent crime. The ter m “racketeer” is used in a very broad way to refer to people who are doing things i llegal in terms of running a business. Susanna says, “Wow, and the people who he lped them were working next door to us all that time.” She is amazed that the people that were working in the office next door were part of this illegal acti vity.

Clark says, “And we didn’t know a thing about it. H ow awful.” When we say something is “awful” (awful) nowadays, we mean it’s  terrible. It’s horrible. It’s very

unpleasant. Clark thinks this entire situation is a wful. Susanna says, however, “How exciting!” She thinks that it’s exciting rathe r than awful.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Susanna: What’s going on in the office next door? I  heard that the police shut down their business.

Clark: You heard right. The cops had long suspected  that the business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.

Susanna: Not legit?

Clark: Yeah, it was a front for money laundering. T he so-called services it offered were a sham. It was a way for people to send them d irty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.

# Basic Military Commands

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,009 – Basic Military Commands.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,009. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Marta and Bruno about giving commands as you would in the military. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marta: What’s going on out here? What’s all that no ise?

Bruno: I’m putting the troops through their drills.

Marta: Troops?!

Bruno: Watch this. Hey, I didn’t tell you you could  be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, march!

Marta: That’s great, but . . .

Bruno: I’m not done. Let me show you what else thes e troops can do. Halt! About face!

Marta: Don’t you think that it’s time to . . .?

Bruno: March, march! Double time!

Child: Wah! [Child crying loudly.]

Marta: Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourse lf? It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.

Bruno: Hey, there’s no crying in the military. Don’ t coddle the troops, Marta.

Marta: Bruno, your twins are five years old. Don’t you think they’re a little too young to be going to boot camp?

Bruno: No, it’s never too young to instill discipli ne. Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now march, march, march . . .

[end of dialogue]

Marta begins our dialogue by saying to Bruno, “What ’s going on out here?” “What’s going on” means what’s happening. “Out here ” usually would be used when we are talking about something outside of a bu ilding or outside of a house. Marta asks, “What’s all that noise?” Bruno says, “I ’m putting the troops through their drills.” “Troops” (troops) are soldiers – an organized group of soldiers or organized groups of soldiers. “Drills” (drills) are  exercises, things that you do over and over again to prepare you for something.

We might talk about drills, for example, in school when math teachers are trying to teach their students how to multiply numbers. Th ey may give them exercises, and we may call those exercises “drills.” Bruno say s that he’s “putting the troops through their drills,” meaning he’s making these so ldiers do these exercises – and usually when we talk about military drills, we’ re talking about physical activity, physical exercises.

Marta is very surprised by what Bruno is saying. Sh e says, “Troops?” She’s asking a question, but is also clearly shocked, cle arly surprised. Bruno says, “Watch this,” meaning pay attention and look at thi s. “Hey, I didn’t tell you you could be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, marc h!” Bruno uses some common military terms here. He’s talking to Marta and tell ing Marta to watch what he is doing with his troops.

He then says to one of the (what we believe are) so ldiers, “at ease.” “At ease” (ease) means to be relaxed, to be in a comfortable position. In the military, “at ease” is a command telling you that you don’t have to stand at attention. “To stand at attention” is to usually stand up straight  and be very still, whereas “at ease” often is a position that you would take by pu tting your legs, say, one or two feet apart from each other – a more relaxed positio n, in other words.

But Bruno doesn’t want his troops to be at ease. He  says, “Attention!” The word “attention,” when used in a classroom by a teacher,  means that everyone needs to focus, everyone needs to pay attention. In the m ilitary, especially when the

word is said the way I said it – the way Bruno said  it – it means that you are to stand in a very formal position. You must stand up straight. That is to be “at attention.” It’s a sign of respect for your superio r officer.

In the military, there is a certain hierarchy – tha t is, you have people who are in charge of other people. And so, if you are in the p resence of someone who is at a higher level – what they would call a higher “ran k” (rank) – then you must stand at attention, or least in certain situations you mu st stand at attention. Here, Bruno is telling his soldiers to stand at attention. Then  he says, “Fall in.” “To fall in” means to take your place in line, the place where y ou’re supposed to be. Usually it is said before the troops begin to walk in an or ganized manner.

Walking in a certain organized way, walking in a ce rtain pattern, is called “marching.” We use the verb “to march” (march) to m ean to walk forward in a very organized – I guess what we may call “military ” – way. If you’ve seen soldiers who are all walking down the street in a l ine, such as in a parade, then you know what marching is. “Forward, march” means t o walk forward, to go forward. “Forward, march” is used to tell the soldi ers that they should now start walking. Bruno is telling his soldiers to march.

Marta says, “That’s great, but . . .” Bruno then in terrupts her and says, “I’m not done,” meaning I’m not finished. He says, “Let me s how you what else these troops can do.” He then turns and talks to his troo ps. “Halt! About face!” “Halt” (halt) is a command meaning stop, especially when y ou’re talking to a soldier who is walking. If you tell someone to halt, you’re  telling him or her to stop walking, to stop moving. Outside of the military, y ou won’t hear this word used very much anymore.

There’s an old expression, “Halt! Who goes there?” “Who goes there?” means “Who is there?” If it’s dark outside and you can’t see the face of the person who is walking toward you and you are afraid, you might  say, “Halt! Who goes there?” Well, you actually wouldn’t say that anymore. It’s kind of an old-fashioned expression. “Halt” is used mainly now just in the m ilitary, and that’s the way Bruno is using it in our dialogue.

He says to his troops, “Halt!” – meaning stop walki ng – “About face.” “About face” means to turn around. If you are walking east, “abo ut face” would be to turn around toward the west. It means to move 180 degree s from where you are now so that you are now facing or looking toward the op posite direction. Marta says, “Don’t you think it’s time to . . .?” She’s asking Bruno a question, but Bruno isn’t listening. He’s still talking to his troops.

He says, “March, march! Double time!” “Double time”  is a phrase used in the military to mean “Walk twice as fast as you’re walk ing right now.” “Double time” means to do something twice as quickly as you would  normally do it. Then we hear a child crying – who sounds a lot like me, act ually. Marta then says, apparently to this child, “Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourself? It’s okay. Everything is going to be okay.” Marta is tal king to this child and asking if the child fell down and hurt himself. Then she says , “It’s okay,” and she tries to comfort the child – she tries to make the child fee l better.

Bruno says, “Hey, there’s no crying in the military .” The “military” refers to the army, the navy, and the other, what we would call, “armed forces” for a given country. Bruno says, “Don’t coddle the troops, Mart a.” “To coddle” (coddle) means to treat someone too kindly or too gently, es pecially when we’re talking about children. Bruno doesn’t want Marta to coddle his troops. Marta says, “Bruno, your twins are five years old.” Now we disc over that these troops that Bruno has been ordering around are, in fact, his fi ve-year-old children.

Marta says, “Don’t you think they’re a little too y oung to be going to boot camp?” “Boot (boot) camp” is typically where you go when y ou first join the military. It’s a place for getting you ready to be part of the army or the navy or the Marine Corps or whatever military service you’re joining. Boot c amp is usually a very difficult period where you must do a lot of physical activiti es in order to get strong enough to be part of the military. Boot camp is also a pla ce where you learn military discipline, and that’s what Bruno is interested in.

He says, “No, it’s never too young to instill disci pline.” “Discipline” (discipline) is the practice of following some set of rules, some s et of regulations or guidelines for behavior. “To instill (instill) discipline” mea ns to train or to teach someone to follow these rules, these guidelines. Bruno says, “ It’s never too young to instill discipline.” He means that even though his children  are only five years old, they are old enough to learn this discipline.

Then he says to his troops. “Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now, march, march, march . . .” “To mark time” means to march without walking. So, what you’re doing is you’re walking in place. You’re lifting yo ur legs up as though you were walking, but you’re not actually moving forward. Th at’s “marking time.” Again, it’s a command, an order, that you would hear in the mil itary.

We may also use this expression “He’s marking time”  to mean that he’s not really doing anything. He’s sort of wasting his time or he ’s spending his time waiting for something to end – waiting, perhaps, for something more important to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marta: What’s going on out here? What’s all that no ise?

Bruno: I’m putting the troops through their drills.

Marta: Troops?!

Bruno: Watch this. Hey, I didn’t tell you you could  be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, march!

Marta: That’s great, but . . .

Bruno: I’m not done. Let me show you what else thes e troops can do. Halt! About face!

Marta: Don’t you think that it’s time to . . .?

Bruno: March, march! Double time!

Child: Wah! [Child crying loudly.]

Marta: Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourse lf? It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.

Bruno: Hey, there’s no crying in the military. Don’ t coddle the troops, Marta.

Marta: Bruno, your twins are five years old. Don’t you think they’re a little too young to be going to boot camp?

Bruno: No, it’s never too young to instill discipli ne. Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now march, march, march . . .

[end of dialogue]

# Using GPS When Driving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,010 – Using GPS When Driving.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,010 – or we could say, “ten-ten.” My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan. I’m comin g to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. You can do that by becoming a member of ES L Podcast. This episode is a dialogue between Justin and Fay about using so mething called “GPS,” a navigation system, when you are driving. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Justin: Okay, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.

Fay: Wait! We don’t know where we’re going. We’re s trangers in a strange land. Where’s our guide?

Justin: We don’t need a guide. See this? It’s GPS a nd it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.

Fay: I’m not sure it’s reliable. We’re in a pretty remote location.

Justin: Relax and let me explain how this works: GP S systems use satellites to locate your current location. Information is transm itted to this receiver, so it always knows exactly where we are. We input the add ress of our destination and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.

Fay: I know how a GPS system works. I’m worried tha t there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go. I read that many printed ma ps of this region are outdated and unreliable.

Justin: Don’t worry. This GPS is the state-of-the-a rt. I’m sure it’ll be accurate.

Fay: A fool with a tool is still a fool.

Justin: What did you say?

Fay: Nothing.

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Justin saying to Fay, “Oka y, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.” “Let’s get on the road” means let’s get moving. Let’s get into the car and leave. Fay says, “Wait! We don’t know where we’ re going. We’re strangers in a strange land.” A “stranger” is someone you don’t know. A stranger can also be someone from a different country or city or state w ho is visiting or who has moved to a new place and is unfamiliar with that pl ace.

The phrase “stranger in a strange land” is familiar  to some Americans because it was the title of a book written back in the early 1 960s. In any case, we’re not talking about a book. We’re talking about Fay and J ustin. Fay says to Justin, “Where’s our guide?” A “guide” (guide) is normally a person who leads a group of people on a tour or who helps someone get to the pl ace where they want to go.

Justin says, “We don’t need a guide. See this?” He’ s asking Fay to look at something he’s pointing to or holding. “See this? I t’s GPS and it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.” “GPS,” which stan ds for “Global Positioning System,” is an electronic device or part of an elec tronic device that helps you identify where you are right now and gives you dire ctions about how to get somewhere you want to go.

Many cars now have GPS devices in them, so you can put the information about where you are going into this small computer, and i t will tell you how to get to where you want to go from where you are now. Many s martphones have this feature. For example, my phone has a feature on it that I use as basically a GPS device. I open my map application and enter the add ress where I am going, and it will tell me how to get there.

Justin says that GPS will help them navigate to whe re they want to go. “To navigate” (navigate) means to figure out the best w ay to get to your destination, to the place where you’re going. If you are navigat ing in your car, you are deciding which route to take – which way to go in o rder to arrive at the place you want to go. Fay says, “I’m not sure it’s reliable.”  Something that is “reliable” is something that is trustworthy, something that you can count on, something you can depend on.

Fay is not sure the GPS is something they can depen d on. She says, “We’re in a pretty remote location.” “Remote” (remote) means fa r from areas where people live and work – to be a great distance from where m ost people are. If you are in

the middle of the desert, you are in a remote locat ion. You are not close to any city or town, or perhaps even other people.

Justin says, “Relax and let me explain how this wor ks: GPS systems use satellites to locate your current location.” A “sat ellite” (satellite) is a machine that is located many miles above the earth, that goes ar ound the earth and is used to communicate radio signals or other electronic signa ls from one part of the earth to another. Satellites are used for other things as  well, of course.

A GPS satellite is used to help locate where a pers on is or a certain thing is. In the dialogue, the GPS satellites are used to locate  your current location. “Current” means where you are right now. “Location”  means where you are. So, your “current location” would be where you are righ t now as we are speaking. Justin continues, “Information is transmitted to th is receiver so it always knows exactly where we are.”

“To transmit” (transmit) means to send – specifical ly, to send electronic information. A “receiver” is something that receive s an electronic signal. Your television is a receiver. It receives electronic si gnals. It doesn’t send, typically, electronic signals – that would be called a “transm itter,” from the verb “to transmit.” A receiver receives the signals that are  transmitted.

Justin says, “We input the address of our destinati on and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.” “To input” (input) m eans to enter information into a machine such as a computer. Your “destination” (des tination) is the place where you’re going. Justin says, “We input the address of  our destination and presto!” “Presto” (presto) is an informal word used to annou nce that something has been done and is now finished, especially when it was do ne very quickly and easily, without a lot of work or effort.

Justin says if they put the address of their destin ation into the GPS computer, it will give them “onscreen or voice directions.” “Ons creen” means that it appears on a small electronic screen, sort of like what you  have on your smartphone or your computer. “Voice directions” – voice direction s are words spoken by the computer, the GPS computer, that tell you where you  should go.

So, typically you would hear things like, “Turn lef t at the next intersection.” An “intersection” is a place where two roads or street s cross. Or the GPS system may say something like, “In two miles, turn right o n Highway 25.” I think I should try to get a job as the voice of the GPS system. I think that would be kind of fun. They could record me, and then people could listen to me as they were driving,

and I would tell them where to go. That would be a little weird, I think. But back to our dialogue . . .

Fay says, “I know how a GPS system works. I’m worri ed that there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go.” Fay is saying that sh e understands the technology of GPS. She’s just worried that there ar en’t good maps of the areas where they’re going to travel, and therefore the GP S system won’t be able to help them. She says, “I read that many printed maps  of this region are outdated and unreliable.”

When something is “outdated” (outdated) – one word – we mean that it has old information that is no longer accurate, perhaps bec ause things have changed. We also use the word “outdated” to describe somethi ng that is no longer fashionable or modern. We might talk about a certai n style of clothing as being outdated, or certain ideas as being outdated.

Justin says, “Don’t worry. This GPS system is the s tate-of-the-art.” That expression, “state-of-the-art” (art), refers to the  most modern, most current technology – something that is the latest in some p articular technology or process. “State-of-the-art computers” would be comp uters that are new, that have the best and newest technology. Justin says, “ I’m sure it’ll be accurate.” “To be accurate” means to have the correct information.

Fay says, “A fool with a tool is still a fool.” Thi s is actually an expression that my sister taught me. “A fool with a tool is still a fo ol.” A “fool” (fool) is a stupid person, or a person who isn’t very intelligent. A “tool” (t ool) is something you use to get something done. It’s an instrument.

The expression means that just because you have a t ool – just because you have, in this case, technology – doesn’t mean that you aren’t stupid. You need to know how to use the technology. The technology does n’t make you smart. You have to know how to use it. So, a fool with a tool is still a fool. The tool doesn’t take away, if you will, his stupidity. A machine do esn’t make you smart. If you’re not smart, having the machine won’t help. That’s the idea behind that expression.

Justin says, “What did you say?” Sometimes when we don’t hear what another person says to us, we may say, “What did you say?” If you say it in a certain way, however, you’re sort of implying that you heard wha t the person said and you weren’t very happy with what he or she said. The wa y Justin says, “What did you say?” implies that he understood what Fay said, and  he understood that Fay was insulting him.

Fay, however, simply says, “Nothing,” meaning what I said to you isn’t a very important and I’m not going to say it again. I’m no t going to repeat it for you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Justin: Okay, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.

Fay: Wait! We don’t know where we’re going. We’re s trangers in a strange land. Where’s our guide?

Justin: We don’t need a guide. See this? It’s GPS a nd it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.

Fay: I’m not sure it’s reliable. We’re in a pretty remote location.

Justin: Relax and let me explain how this works: GP S systems use satellites to locate your current location. Information is transm itted to this receiver, so it always knows exactly where we are. We input the add ress of our destination and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.

Fay: I know how a GPS system works. I’m worried tha t there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go. I read that many printed ma ps of this region are outdated and unreliable.

Justin: Don’t worry. This GPS is the state-of-the-a rt. I’m sure it’ll be accurate.

Fay: A fool with a tool is still a fool.

Justin: What did you say?

Fay: Nothing.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,011 – Building with Wood and Metal.

This episode is a dialogue between Hugo and Shawna about building things with wood and metal. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hugo: Wow, when you said that you did some woodwork ing on the weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture. But this! This is a real workshop and you’re actually building furniture.

Shawna: Yeah, this is what I’m working on right now . I’m building a dining table and chairs.

Hugo: The grain is beautiful on this piece of hardw ood. It certainly looks better than the plywood furniture I have in my house. What  is all this?

Shawna: Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and d rills.

Hugo: And what is all this metal for?

Shawna: I’m adding some grillwork for the back of t he chairs. I don’t usually do metalwork, but I’m keeping it simple.

Hugo: This doesn’t look simple. These pieces have b een welded together, and is that used for soldering?

Shawna: You got it. When all is said and done, I’ll  have a new dining room set with a large table and eight chairs.

Hugo: Wow, I’m impressed.

Shawna: Want to try your hand at it?

Hugo: No thanks. You see these 10 fingers? I’m rath er fond of them.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about building things. We begin  with Hugo saying to Shawna, “Wow, when you said you did some woodworking on the  weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture.” “Wow” is an expre ssion of surprise. Hugo is surprised when he sees what Shawna is doing.

Shawna is doing some “woodworking.” “Woodworking” i s making things out of wood, the material. “Wood,” of course, comes from t rees. You cut the tree down in order to get the wood that you use to build thin gs with. Shawna is interested in woodworking, and she does it on the weekends – on S aturdays and Sundays.

Hugo thought that Shawna had been “refinishing furn iture.” “To refinish” furniture is just to make the surface or outside of the furni ture look more beautiful – to do something to the wood in order to make it look bett er. This is very different than actually building something, of course. What Shawna  has been doing is building things, not just changing their appearance on the o utside.

Hugo says, “But this! This is a real workshop and y ou’re actually building furniture.” A “workshop” is a large room where peop le do work, especially physical things like building furniture or repairin g motors. The term “workshop” is also now used in other situations where we’re talki ng about an area or a place where everyone is working on the same thing.

Sometimes we use this word for a type of meeting, a  type of educational meeting where everyone gets together and learns something n ew or applies the knowledge that they have to make something. It may not be something physical, however. Here it is something physical. It’s furnit ure made out of wood.

Shawna says, “Yeah, this is what I’m working on rig ht now. I’m building a dining table and chairs.” A “dining (dining) table” is a t able that you would put in a large room in your house, and you would eat at that table . It’s the table you would use for eating. “To dine” (dine) means to eat. Shawna i s working on a dining table and chairs.

Hugo says, “The grain is beautiful on this piece of  hardwood.” “Grain” (grain), when we’re talking about wood, refers to the lines and the patterns on the surface of a piece of wood. If you look at a piece of wood that has been cut from a tree, you will see that there are lines in the wo od. These lines are called the “grain” of the wood.

“Hardwood” is a special kind of wood that is very h eavy, that is typically used for making houses, for example, or constructing things that you need to be very solid, to be very stable. We use hardwood very comm only in houses for the floors of the house. My house, for example, has “hardwood flooring,” meaning there are pieces of wood that you walk on. Now of course most  floors are made of some kind of wood. “Hardwood” is a special kind of wood that is, well, very hard.

Hugo says, “It certainly looks better than the plyw ood furniture I have in my house.” “Plywood” (plywood) is a cheap – that is to  say, inexpensive – board that is made from a flat piece of wood. Usually it’s use d by gluing different wood materials together. Plywood is not very strong. It’ s not very hard. It’s used often in order to save money because it’s inexpensive.

It was very popular in the 1960s and ’70s for peopl e to put plywood on the walls of their rooms inside of their houses so you wouldn ’t be painting your walls – you would have this wood. In my house where I grew up, in the basement (in the bottom part of the house) we had plywood on the wal ls. That was very popular in the 1970s. It’s not as popular anymore today.

Hugo says his furniture is made from this cheap woo d. Then he asks, “What is all this?” He’s obviously looking at or pointing to som ething. Shawna says, “Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and drills.” “Tool s” are instruments you use in order to make something. A “saw” (saw) is a tool th at is used to cut wood. It has little sharp points on it – what we call “teeth,” j ust like the teeth in your mouth.

A “chisel” (chisel) is a long tool that has a sharp  end on it. Usually it’s made of metal. We use a chisel to remove small sections of the wood. A sculptor, such as Michelangelo, uses a chisel in order to remove piec es of marble or stone in order to make the sculpture. Here, we’re talking about a wood chisel, not a chisel used with a very hard rock such as marble.

A “drill” (drill) is a tool that puts a hole into s omething – in this case, into a piece of wood. The verb “to drill” can mean to put a hole  into something like wood. It can also mean to practice something over and over a gain. If you play basketball, or any sport, your coach probably has you do certai n “drills” – certain exercises – over and over again. We also use this verb sometime s in school when we give

students things to practice over and over again, of ten used with things that teachers want students to memorize.

Hugo then asks Shawna, “And what is all this metal for?” “Metal” (metal) is something like steel, iron, silver, gold, copper, b rass – all of these are examples of metals. Shawna then explains, “I’m adding some g rillwork for the back of the chairs.” “Grillwork” (grillwork) here refers to met al bars or wires that cross each other in order to make a flat surface. So, the back  of the chair is actually going to have this grillwork on it. The grillwork will be us ed basically as the back of the chair.

A chair has three parts. It has a seat, where you s it on – where you put your behind on, or your “butt,” we would say informally,  on. It has legs that are on the ground, or that are placed on the ground, and it ha s a back, typically, where you can lean back on. You can put the back of your body  on the back of the chair. This chair is going to have grillwork made of metal  on it, which doesn’t sound very comfortable to me, but it’s not my chair.

Shawna says, “I usually don’t do metalwork” – that is, she usually doesn’t work with metal. Hugo says, “This doesn’t look simple.” It does not look simple. “These pieces have been welded together, and is that used for soldering?” Hugo is looking at the metal grillwork and saying that diff erent pieces appear to have been “welded (welded) together.”

“To weld” means to join two pieces of metal by maki ng them very hot, so that they are able to be connected so that when they are  cool, they are then permanently connected. “Solder” (solder) – the “L” is silent – is a material that you use to connect two pieces of metal together tha t might be difficult to connect directly using welding. Solder is a soft material t hat you heat up, and when you heat it up, it melts, and then when it cools down, it stays solid, and that’s how you connect the two pieces of metal.

Shawna says, “You got it,” meaning that’s correct. “When all is said and done, I’ll have a new dining room set with a large table and e ight chairs.” “When all is said and done” means eventually – in the end. This expre ssion is often used when we are trying to give a summary, say, of a story, or w hen we are trying to tell someone the final result of something without givin g them all the details.

Hugo says, “Wow, I’m impressed.” “To be impressed” means that you really think it’s wonderful. You are really surprised at somethi ng in a good way. Shawna says, “Want to try your hand at it?” “To try your h and at” something means to try

to do something for the first time, especially if i t is difficult and if you don’t have very much experience doing it.

Hugo says, “No, thanks. You see these 10 fingers? I ’m rather fond of them.” “To say you are fond (fond) of” something means you lik e something. You think something is good and interesting. It’s an expressi on that you still hear in conversational English, although it isn’t as common  now perhaps as it was 50 years ago.

Hugo says he’s “rather fond of” his fingers. “Rathe r” here means “very.” Why does he say this? Well, because he is saying that i f he tries to do what Shawna does, he may cut off one of his fingers, and becaus e he’s “fond of his fingers” – that is, he likes his fingers – he doesn’t want to try his hand at woodworking or at metalwork.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hugo: Wow, when you said that you did some woodwork ing on the weekends, I thought you meant refinishing furniture. But this! This is a real workshop and you’re actually building furniture.

Shawna: Yeah, this is what I’m working on right now . I’m building a dining table and chairs.

Hugo: The grain is beautiful on this piece of hardw ood. It certainly looks better than the plywood furniture I have in my house. What  is all this?

Shawna: Just some basic tools: saws, chisels, and d rills.

Hugo: And what is all this metal for?

# Preventing Shoplifting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,012 – Preventing Shoplifting.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,012. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Thelma and Luis about preventing or stopping people from stealing things from the store  – what we call “shoplifting.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Luis: Wow, what happened here? I was only away on v acation for two weeks.

Thelma: While you were gone, we redesigned this sto re with an anti-theft system.

Luis: Is that why there are surveillance cameras an d security guards everywhere?

Thelma: That’s right. We’re losing too much money t o shoplifters, and I’m finally doing something about it. From now on, it’s zero to lerance. I don’t care if they’re petty thieves or kleptomaniacs. I’m rooting out eve ry instance of shoplifting and prosecuting to the full extent of the law.

Luis: What are all these cases for?

Thelma: I’m putting the pricier merchandise under l ock and key, and I’ve put security tags on most other items. I’m weighing whe ther to do exit inspections. I don’t want to go overboard.

Luis: [sighs] No, you wouldn’t want to do that.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Luis saying to Thelma, “Wow, what hap pened here?” I should explain, before we get into the dialogue, that Luis  is spelled (Luis) if it’s a man. If

it’s a woman, it’s spelled as (Louise). The same pr onunciation is used, but we have a different spelling.

Luis then asks Thelma, “What happened here? I was o nly away on vacation for two weeks.” Thelma says, “While you were gone” – wh ile you were on vacation – “we redesigned this store within an anti-theft syst em.” So, Luis and Thelma are inside some kind of store. Luis works at the store.  However, he went on vacation, and when he came back, he found that things had cha nged.

Thelma says that they “redesigned” the store. “To r edesign” means to design again. Really, it means here to change the way some thing is organized, especially if you’re talking about a place such as a store or a house or any room that you have. You could also redesign a car. You c ould redesign a program for your school. We can use it both for physical things  and for nonphysical things. Here, we’re talking about the store in which Thelma  and Luis work. Part of the redesign of the store was to put in an “anti-theft system.”

“Theft” refers to stealing. “Anti-” (anti-) is some thing that is against. We use that prefix quite frequently in English. You can talk ab out “anti-discrimination laws” – laws that are against discrimination. You could tal k about “anti-freeze,” which you put in your car in places where it gets very cold. “Anti-theft” would be something that is trying to stop or prevent theft. It could a lso mean that you’re against theft – you don’t like it. It’s a bad idea. But here, it re ally refers to some change that was made in the store to prevent people from stealing t hings from the store.

Luis says, “Is that why there are surveillance came ras and security guards everywhere?” A “surveillance (surveillance) camera”  is a small video camera that is always on. It’s always recording whatever is going on in the room. Many buildings have surveillance cameras. Even some hous es have surveillance cameras on the outside and the inside so you can se e what’s going on. They are designed to produce a video of anyone who might com e into the store or come into the building and steal something or do somethi ng wrong.

A “security guard” is a person who protects a build ing or a house or someplace. Security guards aren’t police officers. They don’t work for the government. Security guards are typically people who work for p rivate companies but who also try to protect a building or a house. Thelma s ays, “That’s right,” meaning yes, there are surveillance cameras and security gu ards as part of this new anti- theft system.

She goes on to say, “We’re losing too much money to  shoplifters, and I’m finally doing something about it.” The word “shop” is somet imes used as a noun to

describe a store, especially a smaller store. The t erm “shoplifting” refers to stealing something from the store. “To lift” someth ing is to raise it up, usually with your hands. Sometimes, however, we use that word “l ift” to mean “steal,” and in the case of shoplifting, we’re referring to people who are stealing things from a store. A “shoplifter” is a person who steals.

Thelma says, “From now on, it’s zero tolerance.” “Z ero tolerance” (tolerance) is a policy or a rule that says that you are not going t o allow this even once. There are no exceptions to the policy. For example, let’s  say a school has a zero- tolerance policy against students who are drinking.  (We’re talking now about high school. Remember, in the United States you can’t dr ink legally until you’re 21 years old.)

If the school has a zero-tolerance policy on drinki ng, that means that if a student is caught drinking – say, by a teacher – there is no “next time” for that student. The student is removed from the school. Even one vi olation, even one time breaking the rule, is enough for you to perhaps be expelled, or kicked out of a school. That’s a zero-tolerance policy. Well, Thelm a has a zero-tolerance policy on shoplifters.

She explains, “I don’t care if they’re petty thieve s or kleptomaniacs. I’m rooting out every instance of shoplifting and prosecuting t o the full extent of the law.” What Thelma is saying here is that she is going to catch every single person who steals something, and she’s going to have that pers on punished. It doesn’t matter if the person steals something small or something l arge, if a person steals something only once or many times.

She says, “I don’t care if they,” meaning the thiev es, “are petty thieves.” “Petty” (petty) is something that is small or unimportant. A “petty thief” would be a person that steals small things, maybe a $10 bracelet or a  $5 T-shirt – something that is not worth a lot of money. A “kleptomaniac” (kleptom aniac) is a person who steals all the time because they have almost like a diseas e; they need to steal things. They are addicted, if you will, to stealing.

Thelma says, “I’m rooting out every instance of sho plifting.” “To root (root) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to investigate and then eliminate anything that you don’t want. “We’re going to root out corruption  in government.” “Corruption” is when government officials get money from people to do things – illegally, that is. “To root out corruption” would be to get rid of  corruption, to find it and then get rid of it. Thelma is going to root out “every insta nce of” – every case of – “shoplifting.”

She’s also going to “prosecute to the full extent of the law.” The verb “to prosecute” (prosecute) means to pursue some sort of  legal action against a person, especially a person who has committed a cri me against you. Technically, the government is the one that prosecutes in a cour t of law before a judge, but you as the business owner can demand or at least re quest that the government go after this person, arrest this person, and punis h this person.

The “full extent of” something is as much as possib le, as much as allowed. The expression “to the full extent of the law” means as  much as the law allows you to. If the law says this person can be arrested and pun ished with one year in jail, that’s what you’re going to try to get for that per son. You’re going to try to get the government to punish that person for an entire year . That would be “prosecuting to the full extent of the law” – arresting people f or every crime that they commit.

Luis says, “What are all these cases for?” He’s ref erring to what are probably metal and glass containers that are used in a store  when you have something that is valuable that you want people to see, but y ou don’t want people to steal. If you go into a jewelry store, for example, the diamo nd rings are not just sitting there for you to grab and look at. They’re in, typi cally, a case, and the case is locked. You can see them, but you can’t touch them.  You have to ask the person at the store to take them out of the case so you ca n look at them.

Thelma says, “I’m putting the pricier” – the more e xpensive – “merchandise under lock and key.” “Merchandise” (merchandise) is  a general term referring to anything that you sell. It could be a shoe. It coul d be a computer. It could be a car. All of these could be considered merchandise. The expression “to put something under lock and key” means to take somethi ng and lock it up so that only someone who has a key to the lock can open the  lock and get whatever it is that you are protecting. “To put something under lo ck and key” is to put it in a place where it is safe.

Thelma says, “I’ve put security tags on most other items.” A “security tag” (tag) is a small device that is attached to something that a  store sells. What happens is when you walk out of the store and you don’t pay for the item and the item still has a security tag on it, an alarm will go off.

This is quite common in American clothing stores, f or example. The clothing all have security tags on them, and if you walk out of the store without paying for it and without removing the tag – which is very diffic ult to remove without a special machine – the security system will be alerted and u sually there’ll be a loud noise made, indicating you’re trying to steal something. So, it’s not a very good idea to

try to steal something, especially from one of the bigger stores here in the U.S. Of course, you shouldn’t steal from any store.

Thelma says she’s “weighing whether to do exit insp ections.” “To weigh” (weigh) here means to consider the advantages and disadvant ages of something – to consider what we might call the “pros and cons” of some action. “Exit inspections” are when you go to a store and there a re security guards that look at you and check the shopping bags you have to make su re that you haven’t stolen anything.

Thelma says she doesn’t “want to go overboard.” The  expression “to go overboard” (overboard) here means to do too much of  something – to do something at an extreme level, we might say. Litera lly, on a ship or a boat, to go overboard means to fall out of the boat or fall out  of the ship into the water, but we use it in a situation such as this to mean to go  too far, to do too much of something.

Luis says, “No, you wouldn’t want to do that.” It s eems like Luis thinks that Thelma has already gone overboard – has already don e too much with all of these different security measures now.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Luis: Wow, what happened here? I was only away on v acation for two weeks.

Thelma: While you were gone, we redesigned this sto re with an anti-theft system.

Luis: Is that why there are surveillance cameras an d security guards everywhere?

Thelma: That’s right. We’re losing too much money t o shoplifters, and I’m finally doing something about it. From now on, it’s zero to lerance. I don’t care if they’re petty thieves or kleptomaniacs. I’m rooting out eve ry instance of shoplifting and prosecuting to the full extent of the law.

# Living With a Hoarder

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,013 – Living with a Hoarder.

This episode is a dialogue between Julio and his mo ther, who apparently doesn’t like to get rid of things – even things she doesn’t  need anymore. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julio: Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of  some of the stuff in this house?

Mom: Why? This house is fine the way it is.

Julio: There are parts of this house that are nearl y inaccessible. There are stacks of magazines and bags and boxes everywhere.

Mom: I need all that stuff. You know I’ve always be en a pack rat.

Julio: I know, but I think things are getting out of hand. You have stuff on every surface and you can’t find anything in here.

Mom: You can’t find anything, but I can put my hand s on anything I want at any time. I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you d on’t need them this minute.

Julio: I think your hoarding is becoming compulsive .

Mom: That’s nonsense. Just because you prefer livin g in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to. I don’t mind a little clutt er.

Julio: A little clutter?! You have junk mail from 1 5 years ago!

Mom: You never know when something will come in han dy. Now, don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few ex tra boxes?

 Julio: No, I don’t!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Living with a Hoarder” (hoa rder). “To hoard” means to collect things, usually things that you don’t need anymore but don’t want to throw out. A “hoarder” is usually someone who collects so  much of something that they don’t have room for anything else. Their house begi ns to fill up with things. Some people hoard only certain kinds of objects; other p eople hoard everything. They don’t like to throw anything out.

You can also use this verb “to hoard” when you are buying a lot of something because you think that in the future there perhaps won’t be any of that thing. If I think, for example, that the price of, say, rice is  going to go up in the future, and/or that perhaps there won’t be any rice availab le to buy in the stores, I might decide to go to the store and buy a hundred bags of  rice. I would hoard the rice. I would keep them until I needed them. In this instan ce, however, we’re talking about someone who keeps things that they don’t need .

Julio begins by saying, “Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of,” to throw out, “some of the stuff in this house” – some of the thi ngs in this house. His mother says, “Why?” The house is fine “the way it is.” Eve rything is fine, she says. Julio, however, says “There are parts of this house that a re nearly inaccessible.” The prefix “in-” often means “not.” So, “inaccessible” means not accessible. “Accessible” means you can get there. You can reach  a certain place. Something that is “inaccessible” is something that you cannot  get to, you cannot reach.

Julio says, “There are stacks of magazines and bags  and boxes everywhere.” A “stack” is a vertical pile. It’s a lot of things pu t on top of each other. You could have a stack of papers, or a stack of newspapers. A  stack of newspapers would be one newspaper on top of another newspaper on top  of another newspaper, and so on. Julio is complaining about the stacks of  magazines and bags and boxes in his mother’s house.

His mother says, “I need all that stuff. You know I ’ve always been a pack rat.” A “pack (pack) rat (rat)” is a person who likes to co llect many things and not get rid of anything. It’s quite similar to a hoarder. Julio  says, “I know, but I think things are getting out of hand.” The expression “to get ou t of hand” means that the situation is becoming uncontrollable. It’s becoming  so extreme, so difficult, that we won’t be able to handle it. We won’t be able to manage it.

Julio says, “You have stuff on every surface and yo u can’t find anything in here.” We use the word “surface” to describe the top of a table or of a shelf or of any flat object that you can put something on top of. Mom sa ys, “You can’t find anything, but I can put my hands on anything I want at any ti me.” Julio’s mother says that maybe he can’t find things in her house, but she ca n. She says, “I can put my hands on anything I want.” “To put your hands on” s omething here means to locate something, to find something. She says she can find whatever she wants.

“I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young  people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you don’t n eed them this minute.” Mom says she collects and keeps useful things. “To coll ect” means to get a lot of the same item, the same thing. She complains that “youn g people these days” – meaning nowadays, in the present time – “throw away  perfectly good things.” They get rid of perfectly good things. The use of t he word “perfectly” here means completely, entirely. It’s really used for emphasis : these are really good things.

Why do young people throw them away, according to J ulio’s mother? “Just because they don’t need them this minute.” She’s sa ying that young people throw things away whenever they don’t need them, ev en if they may need them in the future. That’s the implication of the phrase  “this minute.” “This minute” means right now, at this exact point in time, not i n the future – not tomorrow, not next week – but right now. Sometimes a parent angry  at his or her daughter or son might say, “I want you here this minute.” The p arent means immediately.

Although it has other meanings that we explained ea rlier, “hoarding” nowadays often describes people who collect so many things, have so many things in their house, that it becomes perhaps even dangerous to go  in the house because it’s so full of stuff. Julio thinks his mom’s hoarding i s becoming compulsive. “Compulsive” (compulsive) means you are unable to s top doing something, often because of some psychological or mental problem. the implication of this word is that perhaps the person isn’t responsible for his o wn behavior. The person can’t help, can’t prevent himself, from doing that activi ty.

Mom says, “That’s nonsense.” She says that’s wrong.  That’s incorrect. “Just because you prefer living in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to.” “Sterile” (sterile) means, in this case, very “bare ” (bare) – very clean, very empty, without anything unnecessary present. “Sterile” is often used in the medical field at hospitals and clinics to describe an environment  where there aren’t any germs or bacteria or things that could make you sick. We talk about “sterilizing instruments” before surgery; before a doctor cuts i nto you with a knife, the knife is sterilized. It’s made clean so that it doesn’t h ave anything that might make you even more sick.

 In our dialogue, the mother is describing a place t hat doesn’t have hardly anything in it, and because of that wouldn’t be ver y comfortable. She says, “I don’t mind a little clutter.” “Clutter” (clutter) r efers to things, objects, that take up a lot of space and are not organized in any way. If y ou look at my desk, for example, you’ll see a lot of clutter – papers here and papers there – not very neat, not very organized. My wife can’t even look a t my desk at home. She doesn’t like it. It bothers her because she likes e verything to be very neat, very organized. Anyway, enough of me and back to our dia logue.

Julio says, “A little clutter? You have junk mail f rom 15 years ago.” “Junk (junk) mail” is mail that is sent to you that you don’t re ally want or didn’t request. Julio’s mom says, “You never know when something will come in handy.” “To come in handy” (handy) means to be useful, to be something that might be helpful. “Now,” Mom says, “don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few extra boxes?” Julio’s mother is asking him if he ca n take a couple of her boxes of things and store them in his garage. “To store” as a verb means to keep something in a place until you need it sometime in the future.

Julio does not want to store any of his mother’s st uff. So, he says, “No, I don’t,” meaning no, I don’t have any room in my garage to s tore your boxes. A “garage” is normally a place where you put your car, but man y Americans park their cars outside and put things in their garage that they wa nt to keep but they don’t need right away. They store things in their garages.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Julio: Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of  some of the stuff in this house?

Mom: Why? This house is fine the way it is.

Julio: There are parts of this house that are nearl y inaccessible. There are stacks of magazines and bags and boxes everywhere.

Mom: I need all that stuff. You know I’ve always be en a pack rat.

Julio: I know, but I think things are getting out of hand. You have stuff on every surface and you can’t find anything in here.

Mom: You can’t find anything, but I can put my hand s on anything I want at any time. I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you d on’t need them this minute.

Julio: I think your hoarding is becoming compulsive .

Mom: That’s nonsense. Just because you prefer livin g in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to. I don’t mind a little clutt er.

Julio: A little clutter?! You have junk mail from 1 5 years ago!

Mom: You never know when something will come in han dy. Now, don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few ex tra boxes?

Julio: No, I don’t!

This episode is a dialogue between Vaughn and Sydne y about becoming a spy. What are they going to talk about? Well, I could te ll you, but then I’d have to kill you. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vaughn: You’ve been reading that novel for hours. W hat is it?

Sydney: It’s a spy novel and it’s really good. It’s  about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing cod e breaking, but he becomes embroiled in the world of espionage.

Vaughn: That sounds exciting.

Sydney: Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization and to feed them misinformation. I’d love to be a spy.

Vaughn: You wouldn’t really want to live the life of a spy, would you? You’d have to live a double life, not being able to tell your friends and family that you’re an operative.

Sydney: I wouldn’t care if I could go on clandestin e missions to thwart and sabotage the enemy. Working for the C.I.A. would be  a dream come true.

Vaughn: You’d have to keep a lot of secrets, not di vulging classified information.

Sydney: Yes, so?

Vaughn: Loose lips sink ships.

Sydney: What are you trying to say?

Vaughn: Well, no offense, but I think your cover wo uld be blown after about five minutes!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about becoming a spy. A “spy” (spy)  is a person who works for the government of his or her country and tries to g et information about other countries. Sometimes spies actually do things to hu rt other countries. That’s part of their job. Here, we’re talking about becoming a spy. We begin with Vaughn, who says to Sydney, “You’ve been reading that novel  for hours. What is it?”

Sydney says, “It’s a spy novel and it’s really good .” A “spy novel” would be, of course, a fictional book about international spies.  These sorts of novels were very popular when I was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, especially during the time of what we called the “Cold War,” when there w ere diplomatic and other tensions between the Soviet Union and the United St ates. There are lots of good spy novelists out there. My favorite is John Le Car ré, the British author. But getting back to our story . . .

Sydney says, “This spy novel is about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing code breaking.” “ To recruit” (recruit) means to get someone to join an organization. We often use t his verb when talking about the military. The United States has a voluntary mil itary force, meaning you’re not forced to become a member of the military as you are in some countries. In the U.S., therefore, the military has to recruit people . It has to go out to high schools and colleges and try to get young men and women to sign up to become part of the military.

This novel is about a man who is recruited not by t he military, but by the C.I.A. – the Central Intelligence Agency. The C.I.A. is the part of the U.S. government that is responsible basically for spies – for gathe ring information (secret information, often) about countries and about doing  other things that the president wants the agency to do in other countries . Sometimes these are things the other countries don’t like. In fact, most of the time they’re probably things the other countries don’t like.

“Counterintelligence” (counterintelligence) is a lo ng word that refers to the efforts and activities that other governments go through to  try to prevent someone from getting their information. So, you have the United States, for example, trying to get secret information about, say, another country – let’s just say Canada. You

know, Canada is a pretty . . . pretty violent count ry. We have to be very careful about the Canadians, I think.

I’m kidding, of course. The Canadians are wonderful  people. But let’s imagine that the Americans are spying on the Canadians. The  Canadians don’t want the Americans to find out what they’re doing, so they d o things to hide their secrets. After all, if they didn’t hide that information, it  wouldn’t be secret. These efforts to hide information so that other governments don’t di scover it is called “counterintelligence.”

In the novel, the person – the man – is recruited t o work in counterintelligence doing code breaking. “Code breaking” is also called  by a more technical name, “cryptography.” Basically, it is the art – some wou ld say the science – of analyzing codes and trying to understand the hidden  information in the codes. “Cryptography,” or “code breaking,” was extremely i mportant during World War II, for example, where each country tried to break the secret code of the other country. The “code” (code) here means the system th at is being used to disguise, or to hide, information.

The man in Sydney’s novel has become “embroiled in the world of espionage.” “To be embroiled” (embroiled) means to be completel y involved in something, especially something that is difficult – a difficul t situation. You can also become embroiled in an argument, where two people are figh ting with each other verbally or perhaps even physically. “Espionage” (espionage)  refers to the practice of spying.

Vaughn says, “That sounds exciting.” Sydney says, “ Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization an d to feed them misinformation. A “mission” (mission) here means an important assignm ent, especially one that involves traveling somewhere for a specific purpose . We often use that word “mission” to talk about the tasks or assignments th at a spy gets and has to carry out, or accomplish.

“To infiltrate” (infiltrate) is to become a member of an organization in order to get information about that organization. So, for exampl e, if there are a group of terrorists – people who are trying to blow up a bui lding, let’s say – the government may try to put someone in that group, ge t someone to become a member of that group, in order to get information a bout the group and what it is planning on doing. That would be “to infiltrate.”

What the person in the novel that Sydney is reading  is doing is infiltrating another spy organization. So, the C.I.A. might be infiltrat ing the spy organization of

Canada, whatever that’s called. While we often thin k of infiltrating an organization as a way of getting information from the organizati on, in the novel that Sydney is reading, the spy’s job is not to get information fr om the other organization, but to feed them, or give them, misinformation.

“Misinformation” is information that is given to an other group in order to trick them, in order to lie to them, in order to make the m think something is true when it really isn’t true. You can talk about misinforma tion in a lot of different contexts. In a business organization you might, for example, have misinformation that you give to people who are trying to do the same things  that your company does, and you don’t want them to find out what you’re doing. Basically it’s lying, and so it’s not a recommended practice. However, I’m sure it’s done.

When we talk about governments and misinformation, we’re talking about information that is meant to make another governmen t think something is true when in fact it is not. Now, there’s a related word  called “disinformation” (disinformation). “Disinformation” is when the gove rnment gives false information, often to reporters and newspapers to make them thin k something is true about their country that really isn’t. Disinformation is sort of a special kind of misinformation.

Sydney says, “I’d love to be a spy.” Vaughn says, “ You wouldn’t really want to live the life of a spy, would you?” Notice, this is  a classic example of a tag question in English. The first part is negative, an d the question tag, or part at the end, is affirmative, or positive. “You would not re ally want to live the life of a spy, would you?” Vaughn’s assumption is that Sydney does n’t really want to be a spy.

Vaughn says, “You’d have to live a double life, not  being able to tell your friends and family that you’re an operative.” “To live a do uble life” is to have a secret or hidden identity separate from your normal life. So,  you might work at a bank during the day, but also you work as a spy on night s and weekends. You don’t tell the people at the bank that you’re a spy. You’ re living a double life – a secret life in addition to your normal or regular life.

An “operative” (operative) is someone who works in the spy business, we might say – who works in espionage. Sydney says, “I would n’t care if I could go on clandestine missions to thwart and sabotage the ene my.” “Clandestine” (clandestine), which can also be pronounced “clande stine,” refers to something that is secret, something that is hidden, especiall y if it is related to something that is wrong or criminal. Here, the meaning is basicall y a hidden mission or a secret mission.

Sydney wants to go on “missions to thwart and sabot age the enemy.” “To thwart” (thwart) means to interfere with something so that someone cannot do what he or she was planning to do. “To sabotage” is similar. “ To sabotage” (sabotage) usually means to interfere with someone, but in a p hysical way. You might, for example, blow up a bridge or do something to the en emy’s water supply. Those are examples of sabotage.

Sydney says, “Working for the C.I.A. would be a dre am come true.” We use that expression, “a dream come true,” to refer to the pe rfect situation, an ideal situation for you. Vaughn says, “You’d have to keep  a lot of secrets, not divulging classified information.” “To divulge” (divulge) mea ns to tell someone something that is secret – to give information to someone tha t you are not supposed to, often. “Classified” refers to information that the government says is secret. The government says this is classified information; you  can’t tell anyone else about it.

Sydney says, “Yes, so?” Vaughn then uses an old exp ression: “Loose lips sink ships.” “Loose lips” refers to people who are alway s talking, who are talking to people and giving them information they shouldn’t b e giving them. “To sink” a ship means to make a boat or ship go down into the water. So, “loose lips sink ships” means that people who give information and a re not careful about secret information that they have may hurt the cause of the country – may actually cause the enemy to get information that would lead to the destruction of some part of your country’s military.

Sydney says, “What are you trying to say?” Vaughn s ays, “Well, no offense” – meaning don’t get angry, I’m not trying to upset yo u – “but I think your cover would be blown after about five minutes.” The “cove r” of a spy is the false identity that the spy has so that no one knows that he or sh e is a spy. Your cover might be that you are a photographer, traveling and takin g photographs of things, when in fact you’re a spy for your government. Your cove r is that you’re a photographer.

“To blow someone’s cover” is to reveal who they rea lly are – to say, “This person isn’t really a photographer, he’s a spy.” When that  happens, your cover is blown. “Blown” (blown) is the past participle of the verb “to blow.” I, for example, would make a very, very bad spy. I would definitely not b e able to keep my mouth shut – to not talk. The C.I.A. definitely would not want  me to work for them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Vaughn: You’ve been reading that novel for hours. W hat is it?

Sydney: It’s a spy novel and it’s really good. It’s  about a man who is recruited by the C.I.A. to work in counterintelligence doing cod e breaking, but he becomes embroiled in the world of espionage.

Sydney: Yeah, he’s sent on a mission to infiltrate a foreign spy organization and to feed them misinformation. I’d love to be a spy.

# Conducting a Search

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,015 – Conducting a Search.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,015. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about someone who is loo king for something – someone who is conducting a search. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Security Chief: Okay, people. We’ve just had a repo rt of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this building. Look in every nook and cranny.

Ramona: Excuse me, may I ask a question?

Security Chief: You can when I’m done. Now you two,  I want you to look all over the grounds. Make sure you check in the undergrowth  and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.

Ramona: Do you mind if I ask . . .?

Security Chief: I’ll stay here to coordinate the se arch. Report in if you see anything that could point us in the right direction .

Ramona: I really think I should tell you . . .

Security Chief: Don’t interrupt, please. The rest of you: Spread out and look in the parking lot and behind the buildings. Look high  and low. We’ll search this place from top to bottom and leave no stone unturne d. Now, are there any questions?

Ramona: Yes, is the little boy about five years old  with brown hair and glasses?

Security Chief: Yes, that’s right. How did you know ?

Ramona: Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk  off with your Taser!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the head of security (the security chief, the person in charge of “security” – keeping people safe) saying to Ramona, “Okay, people. We’ve just had a report of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this b uilding. Look in every nook and cranny.” The security chief is talking to the peopl e who work for him, we’re guessing.

He’s talking about a missing child. A “missing chil d” would be a child who is not where he should be. Anything that is missing is not  where it should be – not in the location where we expect it to be. If it’s miss ing, we can’t find it. In this case, they can’t find this child. The security chief tell s the people there to “search,” or look in, “every room in this building.”

“Look in every nook and cranny,” he says. “Every no ok (nook) and cranny (cranny)” is an old expression that means look in e very little place, even though you may think it’s too small or not important. To l ook in every nook and cranny is to be very thorough – to look in every possible pla ce. Ramona says, “Excuse me, may I ask a question?” The security chief says, “Yo u can when I’m done,” meaning when I finish talking, then you can ask you r question.

The security chief goes on and says, “Now you two, I want you to look all over the grounds.” The word “grounds” (grounds) refers t o the land that a group of buildings is on. It’s used to refer to the property  of some, usually, organization or company. It’s often used to describe a larger piece  of property. You wouldn’t usually talk about the land around your small house , for example, as the grounds of your property. It’s normally used to describe a larger piece of property on which there are several different buildings.

The security chief says, “Make sure you check in the undergrowth and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.” The “undergro wth” is the group of small plants that often grow close to the ground, usually  underneath much taller trees. The security chief is telling them to look or to ch eck in the undergrowth because this perhaps is a small child who might be hiding t here. He tells them to “cover the entire terrain.” “To cover” the terrain means t o go and walk or look in the

entire terrain. “Terrain” (terrain) refers to the l and. It’s similar to the word “grounds” in this instance.

Ramona says, “Do you mind if I ask . . .?” She want s to ask a question, but again the security chief doesn’t let her. He says, “I’ll stay here to coordinate the search.” “To coordinate” (coordinate) means to orga nize and plan something, usually something involving the work of a group of people.

The security chief says, “Report in if you see anyt hing that could point us in the right direction.” “To report in” is a phrasal verb meaning to give someone an update on where you are or what you’re doing. A pol ice officer who is out looking for someone might report in every hour and tell his  boss what he has found or where he is.

“To point someone in the right direction” is to giv e someone an idea of where to go or how to do something – to give someone advice or guidance, we might say, about how either to arrive at a certain place or ho w to do something. It can be used to refer to actually giving someone a directio n in the physical sense – you’re telling the person where to go in order to arrive a t a certain place. More generally, though, it’s used to talk about giving s ome information to someone that will help them accomplish some task, to do somethin g. In this case, it would be to help them find the child.

Ramona says, “I really think I should tell you . . .,” but the security chief again doesn’t let poor Ramona talk. He says, in fact, “Do n’t interrupt.” “Don’t interrupt” means don’t stop me from talking while I am still t alking. This chief says, “The rest of you spread out and look in the parking lot and behind the buildings.” The phrasal verb “to spread (spread) out” means for a g roup of people to go in different directions so that together they can cove r or search a larger area.

If there are five people who are trying to find the  child, it doesn’t make any sense for all five people to stay together. Instead, they  should spread out. They should separate so that they can look over a larger area m ore quickly. The security chief tells them to “look high and low.” This is a phrase  we use when giving instructions to indicate that someone should look e verywhere. It’s similar to the previous expression, “to look in every nook and cra nny.” “To look high and low” means to look everywhere.

The security chief says, “We’ll search this place f rom top to bottom and leave no stone unturned. Now, are there any questions?” The expressions “from top to bottom” and “to leave no stone (stone) unturned” are quite similar to looking “high

and low” or looking in “every nook and cranny.” It means to look everywhere. From “top” – from the very highest point – to “bott om,” the very lowest point.

If you’re leaving “no stone unturned,” you are look ing perhaps literally under every rock. The word “stone” here means rock. “To l eave no stone unturned” means that you are leaving no stone that hasn’t bee n looked under, that you haven’t turned over in order to look underneath. Al l these expressions mean to look very thoroughly, to look everywhere possible. Ramona finally gets a chance to ask her question. She says, “Yes, is the little boy about five years old with brown hair and glasses?” She’s asking about the des cription of the boy, what he looks like.

The security chief says, “Yes, that’s right. How di d you know?” Ramona then says, “Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk off with your Taser.” The expression “Don’t look now” is used to mean the sam e as “Surprise,” or “Guess what just happened.” It’s used to tell someone that  you are about to give them some unexpected information, some information that the other person – if he had been more observant, if he had been paying attentio n – should have seen for himself. It can also be used, however, just to refe r to surprising or startling information that you are about to tell someone.

Ramona says, “Don’t look now, but” this little boy “is just about to walk off with” – meaning to take and to leave with – “your Taser.” A  “Taser” (Taser) is a weapon sometimes used by police that produces an electric shock that causes pain and prevents the person temporarily from moving. So, wh at happens here is that the security chief is so busy organizing the search for  the little boy, that he doesn’t realize the little boy is right there and is about to walk off with one of the weapons of the security chief – which, of course, would be rather dangerous.

This script reminds me of a story I read not too lo ng ago about a woman who was part of some tour group. When the tour group wa s about to leave, the leader of the tour group didn’t see the woman, and so they  started to search for the woman. Now, the woman herself didn’t realize who th ey were searching for, and so she started basically searching for herself. It was only after several hours did she realize that the group was searching for her. S he apparently had changed her clothing or something. I don’t know.

Anyway, I don’t know if that story is true or not –  that’s what I read in the newspaper, but don’t believe everything you read in  the newspaper.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Security Chief: Okay, people. We’ve just had a repo rt of a missing child on this property. We need to find him fast. I want you two to search every room in this building. Look in every nook and cranny.

Ramona: Excuse me, may I ask a question?

Security Chief: You can when I’m done. Now you two,  I want you to look all over the grounds. Make sure you check in the undergrowth  and in the trees, and cover the entire terrain.

Ramona: Do you mind if I ask . . .?

Ramona: Yes, is the little boy about five years old  with brown hair and glasses?

Security Chief: Yes, that’s right. How did you know ?

Ramona: Don’t look now, but he’s just about to walk  off with your Taser!

This episode is a dialogue between Jack and Claire about doing something called “pro bono” work, where you basically volunte er some of your time to a community organization to do the kind of work that normally you get paid to do. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: Welcome to the firm. Are you getting the ha ng of things here?

Jack: I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt. But let me ask you o ne thing: Is the firm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro b ono work each month?

Claire: It is. This firm takes community service ve ry seriously. Everyone does pro bono work, and everybody is expected to hit the tar get of 60 hours each year.

Jack: This is so different from my previous firm. T here, everything was about billable hours. Nobody cared about anything but how  many hours we could rack up with each client.

Claire: Billable hours are important here, too, but  we bill ourselves as the firm with a social conscience. That’s what sets us apart  from our competitors. If you fall short of your expected pro bono hours, believe  me, you’ll hear about it.

Jack: It’s refreshing to work for a firm that’s not  all about the bottom line.

Claire: Don’t get carried away. This firm is still here to make money. It’s just not 100 percent of its focus.

Jack: Maybe just 98 percent?

Claire: That’s right. And in this industry, that’s unheard of.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Claire saying to Jack, “We lcome to the firm.” A “firm” (firm) is another word for a company, usually a com pany that offers what we might call “professional services.” Lawyers, for ex ample, usually call their companies a “firm.” A firm is a group of lawyers wo rking together to steal your money (just kidding).

Claire welcomes Jack to the firm. He’s obviously a new employee at the firm. Claire says, “Are you getting the hang of things he re?” “To get the hang (hang) of” something means to become comfortable doing it,  to learn how to do it. She’s asking Jack if he’s figuring out the way things wor k at this particular law firm.

Jack says, “I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt.” The phrase “un der my belt” (belt) means that you have a certain amount of experience or ski lls, or that you have done something for a certain amount of time. Your “belt”  is the thing that goes around the top of your pants to hold your pants up so they  don’t fall down. But the expression “under my belt” just means that I have t his experience, I’ve done this sort of thing, or I have these kinds of skills.

Jack says, “But let me ask you one thing. Is the fi rm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro bono work each month ?” “Pro (pro) bono (bono)” is doing something that you are normally paid to do for free. So, if you are a doctor and you work at a hospital normally, you might volu nteer on the weekend to work at a clinic for poor people. That would be doing pr o bono work. It’s what you normally get paid to do, but you’re doing it for fr ee.

At Jack and Claire’s law firm, each lawyer is expec ted to do five hours each month of pro bono work. In other words, the company  expects them to volunteer five hours of their time each month. Claire says the company is very serious about this. She says, “The firm takes,” or consider s, “community service very seriously.” “Community service” is time you spend v olunteering to help organizations in your community. “To volunteer” (vo lunteer) is to work without getting paid.

Claire says, “Everyone does pro bono work, and ever ybody is expected to hit the target of 60 hours each year.” “To hit the target” (target) means to meet a goal, to

achieve the amount of something that you are expect ed to achieve. We often use that word “target” in a business setting when we’re  talking about the goals and objectives, especially numerical goals and objectiv es – when you’re supposed to have a certain number of things done or perhaps a c ertain amount sold of your product.

Jack says, “This is so different from my previous f irm. There” – meaning at his previous firm where he used to work – “everything w as about billable hours.” “Billable (billable) hours” is time that you spend working for a customer or a client that you can charge the client for. Lawyers, for ex ample, usually charge by the hour, which means they say, “Well, if it takes me f our hours to do this, then I’m going to charge you $100 an hour” – or $200 hundred  dollars an hour, or $500 hundred dollars an hour.

Billable hours are the hours you work for someone t hat you can then bill them for – you can then charge them for. The word “bill” (bi ll) refers to a demand for someone to pay you a certain amount. If you go to a  restaurant, they’ll bring you a bill for your dinner. We also call that, in a res taurant, a “check,” but in the general sense, in other business settings, we would  call it a “bill.”

Jack says at his old company, his old firm, “everyt hing was about billable hours,” meaning the only thing that that firm cared about w as how much money you made for the firm. “Nobody cared about anything but  how many hours we could rack up with each client.” “To rack (rack) up” is a  two-word phrasal verb meaning to get a large number of something, to increase the  amount of something. We often use this phrasal verb in a negative sense whe n you are getting too much of something that you don’t want.

You could talk about “racking up too much debt” – h aving too many loans that you need to pay. You could talk about “racking up c redit card bills” – having different credit cards and needing to pay money on those credit cards because you’re using them, of course. So, “rack up” can be a positive thing, or it could be a negative thing. It’s often used in a negative way , although here in this sentence it’s a positive thing.

Claire says, “Billable hours are important here, to o, but we bill ourselves as the firm with a social conscience.” Claire uses the wor d “bill” here as a verb, in a somewhat different way than we just heard a few min utes ago. As a verb, “to bill” can mean to charge someone, but it can also mean to  characterize yourself or advertise yourself in a certain way, and when it’s used that way, it’s usually followed by the word “as.”

“We’re going to bill ourselves as the best company in Los Angeles.” That’s what we’re going to advertise to people. That’s what we’ re going to tell people about ourselves. “He bills himself as the funniest man in  Hollywood.” He considers himself – and he tells other people that he is – the funniest man in Hollywood. Not me. I’m not the funniest man in Hollywood. I do n’t even work in Hollywood, but that’s another story.

Claire says this law firm bills itself as the “firm  with a social conscience.” The term “social conscience” (conscience) refers to rea lizing, knowing, that you are part of a larger community and that you want to try  to help a larger community. A company with a social conscience might, for example , give money to volunteer or charitable organizations in order to help them.

The term “conscience” refers to your ability to rec ognize right and wrong. When we talk about a “social conscience,” we’re talking about being aware of and helping the community around you. It’s especially p opular when talking about businesses nowadays.

Claire says, “That’s what sets us apart from our co mpetitors.” “To set something or someone apart” (apart) means to make yourself un ique, to make yourself better than other people, to separate yourself, or we might say, “to differentiate” yourself – to make yourself different from other pe ople. Your “competitors” (competitors) are the other companies in the same k ind of work that you are, that are trying to get the same clients that you are.

Claire says, “If you fall short of your expected pr o bono hours, believe me, you’ll hear about it.” The expression “to fall short” is a  verb meaning to not do as well as you are expected to do. The phrase “believe me” is used to emphasize that what you are saying to this person is true. You may  say, for example, “Believe me, I understand your problems.” You are assuring t he person that you understand them. You are telling them that “what I am telling you is true.”

You could use this in lots of different circumstanc es. Whenever you think the person may not believe you or think that you’re tel ling the truth or are being completely honest, you might use this expression, “ believe me.” “Believe me, I really want to go to this show, but I’m busy at hom e tonight.” Perhaps the person doesn’t believe that you really want to go to this show, so that’s an example of how you would use that particular phrase.

Claire says that “if you fall short of your expecte d pro bono hours, you’ll hear about it.” When someone says, “You’ll hear about it ,” what they really mean is that you are going to be in trouble. Someone is going to yell at you or someone is

going to punish you because you did something wrong . Jack says, “It’s refreshing to work for a firm that’s not all about the bottom line.” “Refreshing” (refreshing) means it’s new, it’s interesting. Perhaps it’s exci ting, even.

Jack says, “It’s refreshing to work for a firm that ’s not all about” – that doesn’t just care about – “the bottom line.” The term “bottom li ne” refers to how much money the company makes, how “profitable,” we might say, the company is. Claire says, “Don’t get carried away.” That expression, “Don’t g et carried away,” means don’t get too excited about something. Don’t take this id ea too far. Don’t exaggerate.

She says, “This firm is still here to make money.” Even though the firm has a social conscience and has its lawyers do pro bono w ork doesn’t mean it doesn’t want to make money. Claire says, “It’s just not 100  percent of its focus.” It’s not what it does 100 percent of the time. Jack then say s, “Maybe just 98 percent?” Claire says, “That’s right. And in this industry, t hat’s unheard of.” If something is “unheard of,” it is not typical. It is not common. It is almost never seen. It’s very rare.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: Welcome to the firm. Are you getting the ha ng of things here?

Jack: I am. I worked in another firm for two years before coming here, so I have some experience under my belt. But let me ask you o ne thing: Is the firm serious about wanting each person to do five hours of pro b ono work each month?

Claire: It is. This firm takes community service ve ry seriously. Everyone does pro bono work, and everybody is expected to hit the tar get of 60 hours each year.

# Driving an Off-Road Vehicle

This episode is a dialogue between Claudia and Jae about driving a different kind of vehicle – a different kind of automobile or truc k. It’s called an “off-road vehicle.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: When you invited me to go for a drive, thi s wasn’t what I pictured.

Jae: You’re about to have the ride of your life. Ge t in and I’ll strap you in.

Claudia: What is this thing?

Jae: It’s an off-road vehicle. Haven’t you seen one  before? It has four-wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.

Claudia: When you say “any terrain,” what exactly d o you mean?

Jae: With this baby, we can drive on sand, gravel, mud, and even snow.

Claudia: You mean you intend to take me driving on sand and gravel?

Jae: Yeah, just wait until we start spinning and sk idding. You’re going to love it. You’d better put on this crash helmet – just in cas e.

Claudia: I was picturing a drive in the country.

Jae: But this is much more exciting, right?

Claudia: I don’t know . . .

 Jae: Come on. If you’re lucky, I’ll take you muddin g next weekend.

Claudia: Whoopee.

[end of dialogue] Claudia begins by saying to Jae, “When you invited me to go for a drive, this wasn’t what I pictured.” “To go for a drive” usuall y means to go in your car and drive somewhere that’s pleasant, somewhere that wil l help you enjoy the area through which you are driving. “To go for a drive” often means that you’re not going to one particular destination – you’re just k ind of going out in your car and enjoying driving your car in some, perhaps, nice ar ea of your town or near where you live.

Jae has invited Claudia to go for a drive, but Clau dia says that it isn’t what she pictured. “To picture” (picture) as a verb means to  imagine how something will be, to think about how something will look or will appear. Claudia had a certain expectation, a certain idea about what going for a drive would look like, and it doesn’t look like what is actually happening. Jae s ays, “You’re about to have the ride of your life.” A “ride” (ride) is, in this cas e, when you drive in the car or you go in some sort of vehicle.

The word “vehicle” (vehicle) refers to a car, or a truck, or a motorcycle, or perhaps even something like you would find on a far m – a tractor. “Vehicles” are things that move other things, including those of u s who are in the vehicle. When you go somewhere in a vehicle, you could say that y ou’re going on a ride. Jae tells Claudia that this will be “the ride of your l ife.” “The ride of your life” would be the greatest ride you have ever had.

Anything that is the “something of your life” is the best possible experience of that thing. If you talk about the “vacation of your life ,” you’re talking about the best vacation that you have ever taken. Jae says to Clau dia, “Get in,” meaning get in the car – or get in, in this case, the off-road veh icle – “and I’ll strap you in.” “To strap (strap) someone in” is to put something over a person so that the person doesn’t move in case there is a problem with the ve hicle.

For example, in a car you have to put on what’s cal led your “seat belt” here in the United States in most states. You must be wearing a  seatbelt. It’s like a belt, but it doesn’t go around your waist to hold up your pan ts. It goes across your body and connects to the seat of the car so that if ther e is an accident, you are going to be protected somewhat; instead of flying out of the window of the car, you will stay in the seat of the car.

 That’s what we’re talking about here. Jae is going to strap Claudia in. He’s going to put on seatbelts so that she doesn’t fly out of the car in case there is a problem. Claudia says, “What is this thing?” Jae sa ys, “It’s an off-road vehicle.” An “off-road vehicle” is usually a car, truck, or m otorcycle that is designed to drive through an area that doesn’t have any roads, that doesn’t have any streets.

An off-road vehicle could be used, for example, in the desert, or it could be used out in the country, away from the city, where there  aren’t any roads. Anything that is designed to ride through an area or go through a n area without streets or roads is called an “off-road vehicle.” “Off-road” m eaning, of course, that it is not on the road – because there are no roads, perhaps.

Jae says, “Haven’t you seen one before? It has four -wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.” “Four-wheel drive” is a feature of  a car that allows it to use all four wheels in order to move forward. The motor act ually is connected to all four wheels in such a way that it gives the car more pow er, or the vehicle more power. “Terrain” (terrain) refers to the kind of la nd or the surface on the land.

Claudia says, ‘“When you say any terrain, what exac tly do you mean?” Jae says, “With this baby, we can drive on sand, gravel, mud,  and even snow.” The term “baby” here doesn’t refer to a young child who has just been born. It refers to, informally, the vehicle. When people use the term “ baby” in this way, they’re using it informally to talk about usually a thing, a piece of equipment.

You could talk, for example, about your phone. If y ou have an iPhone or a smartphone, an Android phone, you might say, “You k now, with this baby, I can text, and I can check the Internet, and I can talk to people.” “Baby” here refers to a cool, powerful piece of equipment or object that you have. That’s what Jae is saying here when he says, “baby.” He says, “With th is baby,” meaning with this vehicle, “we can drive on sand, gravel, mud, and ev en snow.”

“Sand” (sand) is what you would find in a desert, o r on a beach by the ocean, or by a lake. “Gravel” (gravel) are many small rocks t hat are often used for areas where you can walk or drive where there is no forma l road. Gravel is sometimes used when there is a road but it doesn’t have any c oncrete or asphalt – it’s not a smooth road.

When I was growing up in the country in Minnesota, in the areas outside of the city there were lots of gravel roads, and you would  have these little rocks on the road, and the rocks were what you drove over. You d idn’t have a regular street like you have in the city. So, “gravel” is a materi al – the small little rocks – that is

put on the road or some path that you travel on. “M ud” (mud) is basically wet dirt. So, an off-road vehicle can travel on all these dif ferent kinds of surfaces.

Claudia says to Jae, “You mean you intend to take m e driving on sand and gravel?” She’s asking Jae if his plan is to take he r driving on sand and gravel. Jae says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “Just wait until we start spinning and skidding. You’re going to love it.” “To spin” (spin) means to  move in circles, often when you don’t have complete control over your movement, alt hough that’s not always the case. You could spin around on your legs. You could  take your body and turn it 360 degrees. That would be to spin your body like a  ballet dancer.

A car can also spin, and it can spin around in a ci rcle, especially if it’s on a surface that isn’t very stable – like ice, for exam ple. “To skid” (skid) means to have your vehicle move in such a way that you’re no t controlling it completely. It’s moving in a direction that you don’t want it to mov e, perhaps because the surface that you are driving on is slippery like ice, or th at you are going too fast and you are trying to turn your car or vehicle. That could also cause it to skid.

Usually when a car skids, there are marks on the ro ad – what we call “skid marks” – and these are caused by the rubber of the tires on the vehicle. If you see someone stop suddenly, you’ll often hear a high  noise, a high-pitched sound, and if you look on the street, you’ll see black lin es. These are skid marks from the tires of the car.

Jae says, “You’d better put on this crash helmet, j ust in case.” A “crash helmet” is something you wear over your head, like a motorcycl ist would wear, to protect your head in case you fall out of the vehicle and h it your head. Claudia says, “I was picturing a drive in the country.” She’s saying  she thought that they were going to go on a nice, pleasant drive in a car thro ugh an area close to the city. Jae says, “But this is much more exciting, right?” Claudia says, “I don’t know.”

Jae says, “Come on. If you’re lucky, I’ll take you mudding next weekend.” Jae is trying to encourage Claudia to go with him. He says  if she is lucky – if she has good luck, if she is fortunate – Jae will take her mudding. “To go mudding” (mudding) is to drive your vehicle in an area that has a lot of mud in it. Some people think this is fun. I don’t know why, but it apparently is popular in certain places in the country. People take their cars or tr ucks or motorcycles, and they drive in the mud. I know it’s weird – Claudia think s it’s weird, too.

She says at the end of the dialogue, “Whoopee.” “Wh oopee” (whoopee) is an expression we use normally to show how excited you are about something. However, it’s often used as it is here, “sarcastica lly,” meaning you’re trying to

make a joke. It’s not meant to be serious. You’re b eing funny. You are in fact saying the opposite – that this is not going to be exciting, that you are not excited about this particular activity. Claudia is clearly not excited to go mudding, and I don’t blame her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: When you invited me to go for a drive, thi s wasn’t what I pictured.

Jae: You’re about to have the ride of your life. Ge t in and I’ll strap you in.

Claudia: What is this thing?

Jae: It’s an off-road vehicle. Haven’t you seen one  before? It has four-wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.

# Raising Teenagers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,018 – Raising Teenagers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,018. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development here in Los Angeles – make that “beautiful” Los Angeles – California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for the episode you’re li stening to. The Learning Guide contains a complete transcript of everything I say, plus a whole lot more.

This episode is a dialogue between Carl and Marla a bout raising teenagers – helping children who are now getting older become b etter people, a very difficult job. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Hi Marla, I’m really surprised to see you her e. I didn’t know you had kids attending this high school.

Marla: I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meetin g and decided to attend. It’s best to be ready for those teenage years, don’t you thin k?

Carl: Sure.

Marla: I heard that the principal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they start asserting their independenc e. I want to be prepared.

Carl: That makes sense, I guess.

Marla: I mean, more and more teenagers are rebellin g by getting tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs.

Carl: You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking about t his.

Marla: I’ve read a few books on the topic, about ki ds having to deal with peer pressure. It’s my job as a parent to set boundaries  and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space.

Carl: That’s all very insightful, but you have some  time before all that comes into play, right?

Marla: My little Lucas is already four years old. W ho knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and being led astr ay. A parent has to be vigilant.

Carl: Right.

[end of dialogue]

Carl begins our dialogue by saying, “Hi Marla. I’m really surprised to see you here.” Carl wasn’t expecting to see Marla. They obv iously know each other. Carl says, “I didn’t know you had kids attending this hi gh school.” “To attend” (attend) a school means to go there as a student. Carl didn’ t know that Marla had children who were attending, or were students at, this high school. In the United States, high school is usually grades nine through twelve.

Marla says, “I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meeting and decided to attend.” Marla doesn’t have children going to the high schoo l “yet,” meaning her children are probably either too young or go to a different school, but she’s thinking about sending her children to this high school. She heard  about this meeting and she decided to attend. Notice that verb “attend” again.  Here it means not to be a student of a certain school, but rather go to, in t his case, a meeting.

Marla says, “It’s best to be ready for those teenag e years, don’t you think?” She’s saying that she’s trying to prepare herself for whe n her children grow up and become teenagers. I should explain that “teenager” means someone usually between the ages of 13 and 19. Those are the “teens ” in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The teenage years are often considered difficult ones for both the teenagers and their parents. Marla doesn’t have tee nagers yet, it sounds like, but she wants to prepare for what will happen when she does, and so she’s going to some meeting at the high school.

Carl says, “Sure,” meaning “Yes, I agree that you s hould be ready for the teenage years.” Marla says, “I heard that the princ ipal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they star t asserting their independence.” The “principal” (principal) is the d irector or the leader of a school, especially a school that is either a high school or  elementary school.

If it’s a school for older people – that is, someon e who is graduated from high school, such as a college or university – we don’t normally use the word

“principal.” We might talk about the “president” of  the university or the “dean” (dean) of a college. However, here we’re talking ab out a high school, and so the leader is called a principal. Notice that it’s spel led “-pal” at the end. There’s another word that sounds exactly the same: “princip le.” That spelling of “principle” refers to a belief or an idea behind a certain set of beliefs.

This talk by the principal is going to be about how  to “handle,” or take care of, “teenagers as they start asserting their independen ce.” “To assert (assert) one’s independence” is to demonstrate through your action s that you don’t need to be or want to be controlled by others. This is especia lly common among teenagers, who are used to being told what to do by their pare nts. They want to separate themselves, in a way, from their parents. They want  to be “independent” – responsible for their own actions. Basically, they don’t want their parents telling them what to do anymore.

Carl says, “That makes sense, I guess,” meaning it makes sense that Marla wants to prepare herself for her children becoming teenagers. Marla says, “I mean, more and more teenagers are rebelling by gett ing tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs.” “To rebel” (rebel) i s to fight against someone or some group that is controlling you. “To rebel” mean s to go against someone – to have a different idea and to demonstrate that you a re opposed to the other person’s ideas or opposed to their control over you .

Teenagers rebel when they don’t want their parents to control them anymore, perhaps. Teenagers can rebel. They can demonstrate that they want to be independent through a number of different ways. One  way, I guess, would be to get a tattoo. I don’t’ know that many teenagers who  get tattoos. I guess sometimes it is possible for a teenager to get a sm all tattoo, but if you want to get a tattoo in the United States, you usually need the  permission of your parents.

Some states have laws requiring that a parent give his or her approval for their teenager’s tattoo. Many people who put on tattoos –  we would call them “tattooists” – have their own policies requiring th at teenagers get their parents’ permission even if the law doesn’t require it, but I suppose it does happen.

Marla also talks about “piercings.” A “piercing” (p iercing) is a small hole that is put in your body, especially in the lower part of y our ear or possibly your nose, where you put a little piece of jewelry – or at lea st that’s what I’m told. Girls often get their ears pierced, although it has become more  common in the last 30 years or so for men to also wear earrings. I’m not one of  them.

Finally, Marla is concerned about her teenager’s (o r soon-to-be teenager’s)

experimenting with drugs. “Experimenting with drugs ” means to begin to use illegal drugs such as marijuana and other kinds of drugs. At the time we record this episode, there’s at least one state in the Uni ted States where marijuana is legal, but not for teenagers, certainly. Not yet, I  guess.

Carl says, “You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking a bout this.” Marla says, “I’ve read a few books on the topic, about kids having to deal  with peer pressure.” “Peer (peer) pressure” is the influence that your friends  – especially your classmates in high school – have on you, the influence that the p eople around you have on you, who are the same age as you. Usually we use th is expression when talking about elementary and secondary schools – that is to  say, grade schools and high schools.

Marla says, “It’s my job as a parent to set boundar ies and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space.” There a re several words there that need explaining. The first is the expression “to se t (set) boundaries (boundaries).” A “boundary” is a limit to something . Usually it’s where two different countries or two different geographical a reas come together. It’s the line that separates them.

“To set boundaries,” however, means to have limits on what your children can do. That means, of course, there are things that th ey can’t do, and so the parent sets the rules – sets the boundaries – for the beha vior of his or her children. “To be strict” (strict) means to have a lot of rules or  rules that the person may consider very restrictive, that don’t allow him to do very much. “Strict” also has the idea of not making any exceptions to the rule. You have to follow the rule exactly as it is stated.

The phrasal verb “to call for” means to require, to  need. So, Marla is talking about being stricter “if it’s called for” – if it’s requi red. She also mentions “easing up.” “To ease (ease) up” means to become more relaxed, t o be less strict. It’s the opposite of “strict.” If your child “needs space,” your child wants to have more privacy, more opportunities to be alone without oth er people. So, all of these expressions together now: “It’s my job,” says Marla , “as a parent to set boundaries and be stricter if it’s called for and e ase up when my child needs space.”

Carl says, “That’s all very insightful,” meaning th at all indicates that you have a deep understanding of this topic, “but you have som e time before all that comes into play, right?” The expression “to come into pla y” means to take place, to happen. Marla says, “My little Lucas is already fou r years old. Who knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and  being led astray?” Marla’s

child is only four years old, which means he has ni ne years before he becomes a teenager, but Marla is concerned.

Marla says, “Who knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd.” The expression “to hang (hang) out with the wrong c rowd (crowd)” means to spend time with people that may have a negative inf luence on you. Parents are rightly – correctly – concerned about who their chi ldren have as friends, because friends have a lot of influence on us. Children lea rn all sorts of things from their friends, and so you want to make sure they’re learn ing the right thing.

Nobody says, “Oh, my child is a slow learner, so it ’s okay if he hangs out with the wrong crowd.” No. “We learn from the company we kee p” is an old expression. We learn from the people around us. We often act the way they act, and so you want your child to be around other children, your t eenager to be around other teenagers, who have a good influence on them, not a  negative one. That’s why Marla is concerned about her child being “led (led)  astray (astray).” “To be led astray” means to be influenced to do bad things. Wh en a good person starts to do bad things, he or she has been “led astray.”

“A parent has to be vigilant,” Marla concludes. “To  be vigilant” (vigilant) means to always be watching out for difficulties and dangers  and to be prepared to do something about them. “To be vigilant” means to be careful, to be watchful, to make sure in this case that your teenager doesn’t h ang out with the wrong crowd.

Carl concludes our dialogue by saying, “Right,” but  although normally “right” means “Yes, I agree,” Carl says it in a way that ma kes it clear that he doesn’t really agree. He in fact thinks perhaps Marla is a little crazy worrying about her four-year-old son and what he will do when he’s a t eenager.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Hi Marla, I’m really surprised to see you her e. I didn’t know you had kids attending this high school.

Marla: I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meetin g and decided to attend. It’s best to be ready for those teenage years, don’t you thin k?

Carl: Sure.

 Marla: I heard that the principal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they start asserting their independenc e. I want to be prepared.

Carl: That makes sense, I guess.

Marla: I mean, more and more teenagers are rebellin g by getting tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs.

Carl: You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking about t his.

Marla: I’ve read a few books on the topic, about ki ds having to deal with peer pressure. It’s my job as a parent to set boundaries  and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space.

Carl: That’s all very insightful, but you have some  time before all that comes into play, right?

Marla: My little Lucas is already four years old. W ho knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and being led astr ay. A parent has to be vigilant.

Carl: Right.

# Losing a Passport While Traveling

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,019 – Losing a Passport While Traveling.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,019. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. You can download a  Learning Guide for this episode, as well as take a look at some of our spec ial courses. All of our courses and Learning Guides can be downloaded immediately r ight to your computer.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Nina and Serge about losing your passport while you are traveling.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nina: Oh, my God! I can’t find my passport. I never  should have put it in my purse. I’m sure a pickpocket took it.

Serge: Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it. Let’ s turn out all of your pockets and search for it before we panic.

Nina: I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the po lice. We have to file a police report.

Serge: If your passport has been stolen, we need to  find the U.S. embassy.

Nina: We’re supposed to continue on to the next cou ntry on our tour tomorrow. We’re going to get left behind!

Serge: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need  to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll do that.

Nina: It’s Saturday! We won’t get any help at the e mbassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.

Serge: It’ll take as long as it takes. Now, let’s s earch through all of your belongings before we do anything else.

Nina: I just thought of something.

 Serge: What?

Nina: I think I may have left it in the hotel room.

Serge: You think you may have left it in the hotel room.

Nina: Isn’t that good news? All that worry for noth ing.

Serge: Let’s not count our chickens. You might have  another inspiration.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Nina saying to Serge, “Oh,  my God! I can’t find my passport.” Your “passport” (passport) is your offic ial identifying document that is given to you by the country in which you are a citi zen. Typically, you have to be a citizen or an official member of the country in ord er to get a passport. Sometimes, in some countries, you can have more tha n one passport if you are a citizen of more than one country.

Nina says that she can’t find her passport. She say s, “I never should have put it in my purse.” She’s regretting putting it in her pu rse. She’s saying, “I wish I had not done that.” She continues, “I’m sure a pickpock et took it.” A “pickpocket” (pickpocket) is a person who steals your money or y our wallet from either your pants or shirt or a bag that you are carrying. Pick pockets are common in almost every city in the world, certainly cities that have  a lot of tourists. These are thieves that are able to take things from people.

Sometimes they’re very good. They’re very sophistic ated in what they do. You don’t even realize that they have stolen something from you. The reason we call them “pickpockets” is because a “pocket” is a pouch  or a internal bag, if you will, inside of either a shirt or your pants where you ke ep things, where you hold things. “To pick” here means to take, to take out o f, or really, to steal. Interestingly, we also use that same verb “to pick”  when we are talking about someone who opens a lock without the key, something  a thief would also do.

Serge says, “Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it .” “To misplace” something is to accidentally put something somewhere without realizing or remembering where you put it. This happens to me all the time. Maybe I’m just getting old. Serge says, “Let’s turn out all of your pockets and  search for it before we panic.” “To turn out your pockets” means to take the pocket , the material of which the pocket is made, and pull it out of your pants – to basically turn it inside out, to

take the inner part and bring it to the exterior. T hat’s “to turn out,” in this case, “your pockets.”

My mother used to tell me before I gave her my dirt y clothes to wash to turn out the pockets. In other words, take my hand and put i t inside of the pocket and pull it out. She, of course, didn’t want any paper or co ins in there when she put it into the clothes washer. And you can imagine, with a fam ily of 13, we had a lot of clothes to wash.

Anyway, Serge doesn’t want to panic. “To panic” (pa nic) means to get very worried and perhaps fearful about something. Usuall y this happens quite suddenly, and it causes you often not to think very  clearly or very logically. Nina says, “I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the p olice,” she says. “To flag down” someone is to get someone’s attention, usually by r aising your arm and moving it back and forth, moving your hand back and forth, so  that you get the attention of someone. We usually use this two-word phrasal verb when talking about getting the attention of a police officer or perhaps a taxi  driver.

Serge is trying to help Nina, but Nina thinks that she has definitely lost her passport and wants him to get the police. She says,  “We have to file a police report.” “To file (file) a police report” is to off icially report a crime, to go to the police and say, “Someone has committed a crime” – s omeone has done something wrong and I want you to know about it. the police then usually take your information, writing it down on a piece of pap er or putting it into their computers, and then when you leave, they go back an d have coffee and donuts and forget all about you. No, I’m kidding, of cours e, mostly.

Serge says, “If your passport has been stolen, we n eed to find the U.S. Embassy.” We’re assuming of course that Nina and Se rge are in another country. That’s usually the only time you would tak e your passport with you. An “embassy” (embassy) is the official building where the official representative from a country, called the “ambassador,” would work. Acc ording to international law, embassies are really property of the country which they represent, although that doesn’t always work out so well.

If you are traveling in another country and you los e your passport, you do in fact have to go to an embassy. Sometimes, if it’s a big country, the embassy will have smaller offices in different parts of that country.  These are called “consulates.” Nina says, “We’re supposed to continue on to the ne xt country on our tour tomorrow.” So, Serge and Nina are traveling on a to ur, and they’re supposed to leave the country they are in now tomorrow. “We’re going to get left behind,” Nina says. “To be left behind” means to be unable to go with the rest of the group as it

advances or progresses or moves forward, in this ca se, as it goes to another country.

“To leave behind” is it common phrasal verb. There was a law a few years ago called “No Child Left Behind.” The idea was that yo u wouldn’t want to leave schoolchildren, some schoolchildren, behind others in terms of their academic achievement, and this was a program that was suppos ed to help American students. I’m not sure if it did, but that was the idea. They spent a lot of money on it, though. I can I can tell you that.

Anyway, Serge says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselv es.” “To get ahead of yourself” is to do something sooner than you should  or sooner than you need to do it. Often we use this expression when someone is  worrying about something that might happen in the future even though it’s to o soon, really, to think about that particular event. Nina is already worrying abo ut being left behind on their tour even before they’ve had a chance to look prope rly for the passport. That’s why Serge says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll d o that.” “Temporary” means for a short time – not permanent.

Nina says, “It’s Saturday. We won’t get any help at  the embassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.” “To be stuck” (stuck) somewhe re is to be unable to move – not to be able to leave a place. Sometimes we use t his expression when we are having difficulty with some task, and we can’t seem  to move forward or to progress on it. “I’m stuck on this math problem” – I need to find the answer before I can go on to the next problem.

Serge says, “It takes as long as it takes.” This is  a common expression nowadays also. “It takes as long as it takes” is a phrase that we use when you don’t really know how long something is going to ta ke, but you just have to accept it. There’s nothing you can do about it. A v ariation on this expression is, “It is what it is,” which means “This is the situation. ” You can’t change it. That’s just the way it’s going to be, so we’re going to have to  accept it and do what we can under these perhaps difficult circumstances.

Serge says, “Let’s search through all of your belon gings before we do anything else.” Serge once again is trying to get Nina to lo ok again for her passport in her belongings. Your “belongings” (belongings) – always  plural – are your possessions, things that you own: your suitcase, yo ur clothing, your purse, and so forth. Nina says, “I just thought of something.”  Serge says, “What?” “I think I may have left it in the hotel room,” Nina says. Ser ge says, “You think you may have left it in the hotel room.” He’s, I don’t know , relieved or upset.

 Nina says, “Isn’t that good news? All that worrying  for nothing.” The expression “for nothing” means for no purpose, without any goo d reason. Serge says, “Let’s not count our chickens.” “To count your chickens” i s actually a shortened form of a longer expression, which is “to count your chicke ns before they’re hatched (hatched).”

When a chicken lays an egg – when the egg comes out  of her body – the chicken inside of the egg (the embryo) will develop, and wh en it’s ready to come out of the egg, it will break out of the shell. We call th at process “hatching,” when the chicken is now outside of the eggshell and able to walk around and do whatever chickens do. The expression means that you shouldn’ t depend on something before it actually happens. You shouldn’t count on something. “To count on” something means to rely on it, to depend on it.

The expression, however, is using another version o f, or another meaning of, the verb “to count,” which means actually to put a numb er on something: one, two, three, four, five, six – that’s to count. You don’t  want to count your chickens before they’re hatched because you don’t know if so me of the eggs will actually hatch, and therefore you shouldn’t say, “Oh, yeah, I have 10 chickens” until all 10 eggs have hatched and you can actually count the li ve chickens. That’s the idea.

Serge finally says, “You might have another inspira tion.” An “inspiration” is an idea – usually a new idea, a creative idea, about s omething. Nina’s inspiration is that she left the passport in her hotel room, but S erge isn’t so sure, so confident, and that’s why he says, “Let’s not count our chicke ns.” Let’s not think that the problem has been solved before we actually solve it .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nina: Oh, my God! I can’t find my passport. I never  should have put it in my purse. I’m sure a pickpocket took it.

Serge: Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it. Let’ s turn out all of your pockets and search for it before we panic.

Nina: I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the po lice. We have to file a police report.

Serge: If your passport has been stolen, we need to  find the U.S. embassy.

 Nina: We’re supposed to continue on to the next cou ntry on our tour tomorrow. We’re going to get left behind!

Serge: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need  to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll do that.

Nina: It’s Saturday! We won’t get any help at the e mbassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.

# Making Verbal Mistakes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,020 – Making Verbal Mistakes.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,020. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Like us on Faceboo k at facebook.com/eslpod, and take a look at our ESL Podcast Blog on our webs ite, where we give you some additional free lessons in English every week.

This episode is a dialogue between Omar and Faith a bout making mistakes when you peak – I mean, speak. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Omar: Ha-ha.

Faith: What’s so funny?

Omar: I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it can be p osted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he made.

Faith: Were there a lot?

Omar: Yeah, he mispronounced the last name of the m anager in charge of new products, for one. He also stumbled over the name of the new products.

Faith: I did notice that he had a few problems with  delivery.

Omar: That’s putting it lightly. He stuttered when trying to list the products’ features. It’s true that some of the verbiage was w ritten like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now.

Faith: I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue,  but I didn’t notice all that. I guess I wasn’t listening too closely. But what were  you laughing about when I walked in?

Omar: Paul made a Freudian slip. Instead of saying that “innovation is our bread and butter,” he said that it was our “bed and butte r.” Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.

Faith: I think you’ll have plenty of material for a  blooper reel.

Omar: That’s true. In fact, if this were a film, I’ d have more outtakes than usable footage!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Omar laughing. Faith asks him, “What’s so funny?” Notice, she could have said, “What’s funny?” but in  this situation, it would be more common to say, “What’s so funny?” meaning “Wha t are you laughing at? What do you think is so funny that you are laughing ?”

Omar says, “I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it ca n be posted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he ma de.” The word “verbal” (verbal) means with spoken words. We might also say  “oral” (oral). “Verbal” or “oral” means that you say it, not write it. So, Oma r seems to be the video editor for this company, and he’s noticing a lot of mistak es in one of the videos. He’s editing a video of someone named Paul who is giving  a speech.

Faith says, “Were there a lot?” meaning were there a lot of verbal mistakes. Omar says, “Yeah. He mispronounced the last name of  the manager in charge of new products, for one.” “To mispronounce” is to pro nounce something or say something incorrectly, using the wrong sounds. “For  one” at the end of this sentence means for example, for instance. It’s a ph rase we use when we are saying this is just one of many examples I could gi ve you.

Omar says, “He mispronounced the last name of the m anager in charge of” – or responsible for – “new products, for one.” The idea  is that he committed other mistakes as well. Omar says, “He also stumbled over  the name of the new products.” “To stumble (stumble) over” something is  a phrasal verb meaning not to do very well at. “To stumble over” can also mean  to be walking along and hit your foot on something and begin to fall. That is l iterally “to stumble over” something. Here it’s used more to mean to make a mi stake, especially when you’re saying something – to have difficulty saying  something.

Don’t confuse this with another phrasal verb, “to s tumble on,” or “to stumble upon” (upon). That means to find something that you  think is valuable or

interesting even though you weren’t actually lookin g for it. Omar says that poor Paul “stumbled over the name of the new products” f or this company.

Faith says, “I did notice that he had a few problem s with delivery.” “Delivery” (delivery) here means the way that you present info rmation. When we talk about the “delivery” of the speech, we’re talking about h ow the speech was given – whether you used the right intonation or you made t he speech interesting.

Omar says, “That’s putting it lightly.” Faith says that she noticed “a few problems” with Paul’s delivery of his speech. Omar says it wa s more than a few problems. That’s why he says, “That’s putting it lightly.” Wh en someone says, “That’s putting it lightly” (lightly), or “that’s putting i t mildly” (mildly), he means that you are understating the problem. You are making the pr oblem less serious than it really is. You’re perhaps being kind to this person  by not indicating just how bad things were.

Omar says that Paul “stuttered when trying to list the products’ features.” “To stutter” (stutter) is to repeat the first sound of a word – not intentionally, but because perhaps you have some sort of difficulty in  speaking, or perhaps just because you’re very nervous. When someone says, “I,  w-went to the s-store,” that’s stuttering. Paul “stuttered when trying to l ist,” or give a list of, “the products’ features” – the things that the products had or the  things that the products offered.

Omar says, “It’s true that some of the verbiage was  written like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now .” There are several words and expressions there. Let’s begin with “verbiage” (verbiage). “Verbiage” refers to writing or speaking that contains too many words , that is often confusing or difficult to understand because the person is using  lots of different words – perhaps to confuse you or perhaps because he doesn’ t really know what he’s saying, and so he’s just saying something.

“Verbiage” might also be applied to a text or a spe ech that had a lot of technical terms. We’re not sure which is the case here. Omar says, “It’s true that some of the verbiage was written like tongue twisters.” A “  tongue twister” (twister) is a phrase that is difficult to say, usually because th ere are lots of different words that have similar sounds. These are things that som etimes children like to say as a game.

An example would be, “She sells sea shells on the s eashore.” If you try to say that very fast, you’ll probably make a mistake in p ronouncing it. The importance is not the meaning of the sentence. The sentence is  about a woman who is

selling “shells” – things that you find on the beac h of an ocean – on the “seashore,” which is basically the edge of the ocea n, the edge of the sea. In any case, the important thing about a tongue twister is  that it’s difficult to pronounce. “Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” Tha t’s another tongue twister, which I probably got wrong.

Anyway, Omar says that some of the speech that Paul  was reading was written like tongue twisters, meaning it was difficult to p ronounce or difficult to say. “But,” Omar says, “I thought he would have had it down col d by now.” “To have something down cold” means to have it memorized, to  know it perfectly so that you don’t make any mistakes.

Faith then says, “I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue, but I didn’t notice all that.” Once again, Faith doesn’t think that Pau l’s problems were as serious as what Omar is describing. She says, “I noticed he ma de a few slips (slips)  of the tongue.” A “slip of the tongue” is a mistake, somet hing you say accidentally that you didn’t mean to say. Faith says, “I guess I wasn ’t listening too closely,” or very closely. “But what were you laughing about when I w alked in?”

Omar says, “Paul made a Freudian slip.” A “Freudian  (Freudian) slip” is a mistake that indicates what you were really thinkin g about – when someone says something and they say the wrong words that indicat e (or at least, we think they indicate) what the person was really thinking about . “Freudian” obviously comes from the last name of the famous psychiatrist Sigmu nd Freud of the early twentieth century. “Paul made a Freudian slip,” acc ording to Omar, and Omar tells us what that slip or mistake was.

Omar says, “Instead of saying that ‘innovation’ is our bread and butter,’ he said that it was our ‘bed and butter.’” So, Omar says th at Paul was supposed to say the expression, or the phrase, “innovation is our b read and butter.” “Innovation” is coming up with new things. The expression “bread an d butter” is actually quite common in English. It means the way that you make a  living – the way that you make money to live, to survive. It may also refer t o a company’s most successful product because that’s the product, the thing the c ompany sells, that makes the most money for the company.

Omar says that Paul was supposed to say “bread and butter,” but instead says “bed (bed) and butter.” Paul says “bed” instead of “bread.” Often Freudian slips are associated with something perhaps sexual, and t hat’s probably why Omar calls this a Freudian slip. Maybe Omar was thinking  about his bed – perhaps going to sleep – rather than the topic that he was supposed to be talking about, which was the company’s innovations.

 Omar says, “Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.” A “flub” (flub) is a minor mistake, a minor error. Interestingly enough, the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater was a Disney fi lm called Son of Flubber (flubber). A “flubber” would be someone who makes a  lot of mistakes. It’s a word we don’t use that often anymore in English conversa tion.

I was 12 years old, by the way, when I saw my first  movie in a movie theater. My parents didn’t have money to take everyone to movie  theaters since there were 11 of us – 11 children in our family. Going to movi e would’ve been very expensive. I actually went with a couple of friends  of mine. But this is not important to our story, is it?

Omar says that Paul’s “mind was elsewhere.” When we  say your mind was “elsewhere,” we mean you were distracted and were t hinking about something else instead of what you should have been thinking about and focusing on. Faith says, “I think you’ll have plenty of material for a  blooper reel.” A “blooper” (blooper) is similar to a flub or a slip –  it’s a mistake. Usually we use this word when talking about mistakes that actors and actress es make when they are filming a movie or a television show.

A “blooper reel” is a short, funny video that shows  the mistakes that someone made when he or she was speaking. Sometimes at the end of movies you’ll see a blooper reel, or on the DVD – back when people bo ught DVDs, which I guess soon will no longer be common – there were often bl ooper reels on the DVD from the movie, from the filming of the movie.

Omar says, “That’s true. In fact, if this were a fi lm, I’d have more outtakes than usable footage.” An “outtake” (outtake) is a part of a video that was filmed, but wasn’t included in the final film or the final vide o – the final television show, perhaps. “Footage” (footage) just refers to the rec orded video for a movie or television show. I say “video” since most things th at we film nowadays are done digitally.

Of course, in the old days there used to be physica l film that was in a camera, and the word “foot” was used to describe the length  of the film, so “footage” would describe a part of the physical film – a part  of the filming, if you will.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Omar: Ha-ha.

Faith: What’s so funny?

Omar: I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it can be p osted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he made.

Faith: Were there a lot?

Omar: Yeah, he mispronounced the last name of the m anager in charge of new products, for one. He also stumbled over the name of the new products.

Faith: I did notice that he had a few problems with  delivery.

Omar: That’s putting it lightly. He stuttered when trying to list the products’ features. It’s true that some of the verbiage was w ritten like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now.

Faith: I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue,  but I didn’t notice all that. I guess I wasn’t listening too closely. But what were  you laughing about when I walked in?

Omar: Paul made a Freudian slip. Instead of saying that “innovation is our bread and butter,” he said that it was our “bed and butte r.” Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.

Faith: I think you’ll have plenty of material for a  blooper reel.

Omar: That’s true. In fact, if this were a film, I’ d have more outtakes than usable footage!

There aren’t any slips or flubs in the script writt en by our scriptwriter, the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.

Dean: Such as?

Dr. Miao: Well, for example, there is a meeting ton ight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics. Tomorrow night, I’ll be spe aking to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.

Dean: Those are very important issues.

Dr. Miao: Yes, they are. In this student health cen ter, we see cases ranging from social anxiety disorder to schizophrenia. In additi on to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many typ es of antisocial behaviors resulting from the pressures of college and the str ess of being on their own.

Dean: I know what you mean. One of my roommates cop es with stress by binge drinking. My other roommate has become obsessive-co mpulsive. You should see how clean our apartment is.

Dr. Miao: And you? How have you been dealing with t he stress?

Dean: Me? I think I’m the only well-adjusted one in  the group.

Dr. Miao: Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of pulling your hairs out one at a time.

Dean: What?! No, I haven’t.

Dr. Miao: Denying you have a problem is often a sig n that you have a problem.

Dean: That’s crazy!

Dr. Miao: Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come w ith me.

[end of dialogue]

Dr. Miao opens our dialogue by saying, “At Berthiau me College, we take mental health issues very seriously. “Mental health issues ” refers to problems that someone may have due to psychological or emotional issues, things that perhaps relate to how well they react to stress or to difficult situations. “Mental health” is a general term referring to one’s psycho logical and emotional wellness or well-being. Dr. Miao works at a college, “Berthi aume College.” She says, “that’s why we have so many mental health services on campus.” Dr. Miao is talking to a student named Dean.

Dean wants to know what kind of mental health issue s Dr. Miao is talking about. Dr. Miao says, “Well, for example, there is a meeti ng tonight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics.” A “support group” is a  group of people who get together who all have the same problem, either a ph ysical or a mental problem. One of the most famous support group structures in the U.S. and around the world is “Alcoholics Anonymous.” Alcoholics Anonymo us is a group of people who get together in their community or their neighb orhood to help each other with their problem of alcoholism.

This is a “support group for anorexics and bulimics ,” however. “Anorexic” (anorexic) is an adjective used to describe a perso n who suffers from something called “anorexia nervosa,” which is a mental illnes s that causes you to eat very little and to exercise a lot in order to lose weigh t, but you do it to an extreme extent so that you become too thin, and in some cas es, tragically, you may even die from this disorder. A “bulimic” (bulimic) is a person who suffers from

something called “bulimia,” which is when you eat a  lot of food and then you basically vomit it up – you throw it up – in order to maintain or lose weight.

“Tomorrow night,” Dr. Miao continues, “I’ll be spea king to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.” “Depression” (depression) is a long period of feeling sad, often  associated with lack of energy and lack of motivation. A “lack (lack) of” somethin g means you don’t have any. So, you don’t have any energy or you don’t have any  motivation – or at least, not enough to do what you need to get done.

Dr. Miao is going to talk to this group of students  about the warning signs of depression. A “warning sign” is an indication that there is a problem. So, if you start gaining weight suddenly, and within a month o r two, you’re 10 or 20 pounds heavier than you should be, that might be a warning  sign that there’s something wrong with either the way you are eating or perhaps  some problem that you are having in your body – some physical issue.

Dean says, “Those are very important issues” (the i ssues that Dr. Miao just mentioned). Dr. Miao continues. She says, “Yes, the y are. In this student health center we see cases ranging from social anxiety dis order to schizophrenia.” “Social anxiety disorder” is a condition that cause s you to fear being around other people because you are perhaps afraid of being emba rrassed or of not being as good as the people around you.

“Schizophrenia” (schizophrenia) is also a mental di sorder. This one is related to making it difficult or impossible for you to know w hat is real and what is imaginary. People with schizophrenia often react to  other people and situations in strange ways because they’re imagining things that aren’t actually real. Dr. Miao is talking about the student health center at the c ollege. A “student health center” would be a place where students go to get medical a ttention, to get medical help. This kind of medical help has to do with mental hea lth.

Dr. Miao continues, “In addition to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many types of antisocial beha viors resulting from the pressures of college and the stress of being on the ir own.” Now, let’s break that down and talk about what that sentence means. Dr. M iao is saying that “college students are at risk of developing” certain behavio rs. “To be at risk of” something means that you might be in danger of getting that t hing. There is a possibility that something bad will happen to you.

The bad thing that will happen to college students is that they will develop “antisocial behaviors.” “Antisocial (antisocial) be havior” is a way of acting that

doesn’t show consideration of the people around you . It’s a way of acting that may make you mean to or hurt other people around yo u. The word “antisocial” is also used to describe people who don’t like being a round other people. I think I’m antisocial, actually. Anyway, Dr. Miao says that co llege students are at risk of developing these types of antisocial behaviors.

Dean says, “I know what you mean,” meaning I unders tand what you are saying. “One of my roommates copes with stress by binge dri nking.” A “roommate” is someone that shares a room or an apartment with you . “To cope (cope) with” something means to be able to handle or deal with a  difficult and challenging situation. We use this expression – this phrasal ve rb “to cope with” something – when we are talking about someone who has to deal w ith a difficult situation. “Binge (binge) drinking” is when you drink a lot of  alcohol in a very short amount of time.

“My other roommate,” Dean continues, “has become ob sessive-compulsive.” “To be obsessive (obsessive) – compulsive (compulsive)”  is to be concerned often about very small things. When you are obsessive abo ut something, you’re constantly thinking about it. Normally, when we tal k about someone being obsessive-compulsive, we’re talking about someone w ho perhaps repeats certain behaviors over and over again. They may wash their hands a hundred times in order to make sure they are clean. That would perha ps be an example of an obsessive-compulsive behavior.

Dean says that his roommate has become obsessive-co mpulsive. He says, “You should see how clean our apartment is.” That expres sion “you should see” means this is a very good example – I am giving you  a good example, and if you actually went to my apartment and saw it, you would  understand what I’m talking about. We’ll often use that expression “you should see” when we are giving an example similar to what the other person said, and perhaps even a better case of whatever the phenomenon you’re talking about is tha n the person gave you.

So, someone may say, “Well, my brother is really la zy,” and you may say to that person, “Well, you should see my brother – he doesn ’t even get up in the morning.” You’re giving that person an example of t hat situation or that phenomenon that is perhaps even a better example of  what you are talking about than what the other person gave. So, Dr. Miao is gi ving examples of conditions, mental disorders, and Dean is saying he understands  what Dr. Miao is talking about and then gives her some examples from his own  personal experience.

Dr. Miao then asks Dean, “And you? How have you bee n dealing with the stress?” Dean says, “Me? I think I’m the only well- adjusted one in the group.” “To

be well-adjusted” is to be normal – to be adapted t o some situation and to behave in a way that is appropriate and acceptable.  Dr. Miao says, “Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of  pulling your hairs out one at a time.” Dr. Miao is saying that Dean has a nerv ous habit. A “habit” is something you do over and over again.

You may have a habit of brushing your teeth every m orning. That’s a good habit. A “nervous habit” is something you do, perhaps even  without realizing it, because you are nervous – because you are, perhaps, under s tress. I have a nervous habit. I tap my feet. I take my foot and I pound it  against the ground. My wife absolutely hates my nervous habit. She’s always tel ling me to stop tapping my feet. “To tap” (tap) is to move your foot up and do wn so that it hits the floor or the ground.

Anyway, enough about my mental problems – back to o ur dialogue. Dr. Miao is telling Dean that he has this nervous habit of pull ing out his hairs one at a time – taking the hair, I’m guessing (I’m hoping) on his h ead and pulling it out. Dean says, “What?! No, I haven’t,” meaning he has not de veloped this nervous habit. Dr. Miao says, “Denying you have a problem is often  a sign that you have a problem.” “To deny” (deny) something is to say that  something is not true, to say that it doesn’t exist.

Dr. Miao is saying that Dean is denying that he has  a problem, and that when you say you don’t have a problem, this is a sign th at you have a problem. This is something that psychologists like to say and that h as sort of entered into the general public view of mental disorders or problems : people who deny they have a problem have a problem.

Of course, the other possibility is that a person w ho denies he has a problem doesn’t have a problem, but we live in a world now affected by psychological theory, and this is one that at least is popular am ong a lot of people – that denying the problem means perhaps that you actually  have that problem. And I’m sure that happens, as well.

Dean says, “That’s crazy.” Dr. Miao says, “Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come with me.” Dean is reacting to Dr. Miao’s state ment, saying that she’s crazy, she’s out of her head, she’s nuts. “Crazy” i s a very negative way to describe someone who may have a mental disorder.

So, Dr. Miao says, “We don’t use the c-word here.” The “c-word” here means crazy. When there’s a word or a term that you don’t  want to say out loud, you can use an expression or a phrase like this by just usi ng the first letter of the word.

 It’s usually a word that is a bad word or that you don’t want to talk about or say out loud, perhaps because it is rude or unacceptabl e.

So, someone might say, “I got in trouble by saying the f-word in school.” The “f- word” refers to a word that begins with “F” and in this case is considered a very bad word to say in English. It’s a four-letter word  that ends with “K.” You probably have heard it. So, that phrase has become popular n ow when people want to mention a word without actually saying the word, an d that’s what Dr. Miao is doing here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dr. Miao: At Berthiaume College, we take mental hea lth issues very seriously. That’s why we have so many mental health services o n campus.

Dean: Such as?

Dr. Miao: Well, for example, there is a meeting ton ight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics. Tomorrow night, I’ll be spe aking to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.

This episode is a dialogue between Susan and Jack a bout drinking and driving – never a good idea. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Susan: Hey, Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know a nything about DUIs?

Jack: Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI cases.

Susan: I was just wondering about the penalties for  a DUI.

Jack: Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fine d and may be placed on probation. You’ll need to attend DUI school, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and from work and to and from  DUI school.

Susan: That sounds serious, but what if it’s not yo ur first offense?

Jack: Then the penalties get even more serious. Wit h your second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time, anywhere from 96 h ours to a year, depending on the circumstances. Your driver’s license will be  suspended, and you’ll be placed on probation for several years.

Susan: Those are some severe penalties. But what if  you already have two DUIs?

Jack: Then you’ll get several months in jail, at le ast. Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treat ment program. Why are you asking me all of these questions? You’re not in tro uble, are you?

Susan: No, I’m not. I just met a guy and I really l ike him, but I think he just got his third DUI.

Jack: If that isn’t deterrent enough, you may think  about what kind of relationship you can have with him – from behind bars!

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is between Susan and Jack. Susan says  to Jack, “Hey Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know anything about DUIs?” Noti ce, Susan appears to be a friend of Jack, because she says, “Hey.” That would  be a word we would use with a friend or someone we know well.

Susan says to Jack, “You’re an attorney.” An “attor ney” (attorney) is a lawyer – someone who studies the laws of a particular state or country and often represents other people in legal actions. If you are arrested by the police, you will probably want to get an attorney. In the United Sta tes, if you don’t have money for an attorney, the government will pay for an att orney for you, although it won’t necessarily be the best attorney – but you will get  someone.

In our story, Jack is an attorney, and Susan is ask ing him if he knows anything about DUIs. A “DUI” is when you are arrested for dr iving under the influence. The “I” in DUI stands for “influence,” and that means t hat you are affected by something. What are you affected by? Well, usually alcohol. So, “driving under the influence” means driving under the influence of  alcohol – driving while you have alcohol “in your system,” we would say – in yo ur body – and it is affecting how you drive.

Obviously, if you drink too much, you get drunk, an d then you aren’t able to drive as well as people who are not drinking, or at least  as well as most people who are not drinking. DUIs, then, are offenses – things  you can get arrested for. In the United States, it’s a very serious offense nowadays . In the last, oh, maybe 30 to 40 years, the laws have become much tougher on peop le who drink and drive at the same time. Definitely not something you want to  do, not just for legal reasons, but for safety reasons as well.

Jack says to Susan, “Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI c ases.” “To handle” (handle) as a verb means to be responsible for – to take care of or to manage something.

Here it means to have participated in and taken care of or been responsible for something. A “case” (case) here refers to a legal p rocess or legal matter – something involving the law. Jack says he’s “handle d a few DUI cases” – that is, legal matters that involve people who were arrested  for driving under the influence.

Susan says, “I was just wondering about the penalti es for a DUI.” A “penalty” (penalty) is a punishment for breaking some rule or  some law. Jack says, “Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fined and maybe pla ced on probation.” A “first offense” is the first time that you break a law. An  “offense” (offense) is when you do something wrong, something, in this case, illega l. So, a first offense would be the first time that you broke this law.

I should mention that the laws regarding DUIs relat e not just to people who are drinking, but also people who are taking any sort of drug that would affect their ability to drive properly. If you’ve been drinking and driving, the police will measure your blood alcohol level – the amount of al cohol in your body – and if it is more than the acceptable amount, you will almost  certainly be arrested (taken in by the police) or at the very least you will be given a ticket – a notification that you have broken the law – and have to pay some sort  of penalty or be punished somehow.

One way that you can be punished is to be fined. “T o be fined” (fined) means to have to pay money to the government or some officia l organization for something you did wrong. The fines, which is the amount of mo ney you have to pay for a DUI, can be quite high – hundreds or perhaps even t housands of dollars.

Jack says, “You may also be placed on probation” (p robation). “To be placed on probation” means to be told that you can’t commit a ny more crimes or any similar crime for a certain amount of time. The reason peop le are placed on probation is to prevent them from committing the crime again, an d if they do, then they will be punished even more. So, if you are on probation for  six months or one year and you are arrested again for a DUI, your punishment w ill be much more severe. It will be much greater than if you were not on probat ion.

Usually when someone is arrested for something seri ous, after they are released from prison they are on probation – they have to ba sically not break any laws for a certain amount of time, and if they do, they can sometimes be sent back to prison. Jack says, “You’ll need to attend DUI schoo l, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and f rom work and to and from DUI school.” “DUI school” is basically an educational p rogram you have to undertake, you have to participate in, that reminds you of the  laws of driving.

 “To have your license” – your driver’s license or p ermission – “restricted” means that you can only drive certain places or under cer tain circumstances. So, you can’t drive around the city just because you want t o. You can only drive from your house to your work, for example. That would be one possible restriction on your driving privileges or driving abilities.

Susan says, “That sounds serious, but what if it’s not your first offense?” Susan wants to know what if you have broken the law more than once. Jack explains, “Then the penalties get even more serious. With you r second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time.” A “jail” (jail) i s the same as a prison. “Jail time” means spending time in prison. “Mandatory” (mandato ry) means it’s required. It’s not voluntary or optional. You have to do it.

How much time will you have to spend in prison? Wel l, it depends on the state in which you live. In our dialogue, Jack says it can b e anywhere from 96 hours to a year, depending on the circumstances. “Your driver’ s license will be suspended,” Jack says, “and you’ll be placed on probation for s everal years.” Your “driver’s license,” as we explained, is your permission to dr ive. If your license is “suspended,” you can no longer drive. You have to w ait until your period of punishment is over, which could be several years.

Susan says, “Those are some severe penalties.” “Sev ere” (severe) means very strict or very serious. “Severe” refers to a situat ion that is very extreme in some negative way. Susan says, “But what if you already have two DUIs?” What if you been arrested twice for drunk driving or driving un der the influence? Jack says, “Then you’ll get several months in jail, at least,”  meaning at minimum. “Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treatment program.”

If your license is “revoked” (revoked), it is taken  away from you completely. Notice that you can have your license “suspended,” which means you can’t use it for a certain amount of time, or you could have you r license “revoked,” which means you lose your license completely, and often y ou won’t be able to get another license. An “alcohol treatment program” is a program that helps you get over your problems with drinking. You could also go  into a “drug treatment program” if your problem is with some other sort of  drug.

Jack says, “Why are you asking me all of these ques tions? You’re not in trouble, are you?” Susan says, “No, I’m not. I just met a gu y and I really like him, but I think he just got his third DUI.” So, Susan has met  some gentleman in whom she’s interested romantically, but this gentleman h as three DUIs.

 Jack says, “If that isn’t deterrent enough, you may  think about what kind of relationship you can have with him from behind bars .” A “deterrent” (deterrent) is something that discourages you from doing something  – something that would prevent you from doing something or give you a good  reason not to do something. Jack is saying that the fact that this m an that Susan is interested in has three DUIs should be a deterrent to her. It sho uld prevent her or discourage her from forming a romantic relationship with him.

The reason Jack says this is because it would be, f or one thing, difficult to have such a relationship if a man is in prison. The expr ession “from behind bars” (bars) refers to being in prison. The “bar” here isn’t a p lace where you go to drink. The “bars” are metal rods or sticks that are placed on the windows of a prison to prevent people from leaving the prison.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Susan: Hey, Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know a nything about DUIs?

Jack: Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI cases.

Susan: I was just wondering about the penalties for  a DUI.

Jack: Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fine d and may be placed on probation. You’ll need to attend DUI school, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and from work and to and from  DUI school.

Susan: That sounds serious, but what if it’s not yo ur first offense?

Jack: Then the penalties get even more serious. Wit h your second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time, anywhere from 96 h ours to a year, depending on the circumstances. Your driver’s license will be  suspended, and you’ll be placed on probation for several years.

Susan: Those are some severe penalties. But what if  you already have two DUIs?

Jack: Then you’ll get several months in jail, at le ast. Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treat ment program. Why are you asking me all of these questions? You’re not in tro uble, are you?

 Susan: No, I’m not. I just met a guy and I really l ike him, but I think he just got his third DUI.

# Learning to Act

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,023 – Learning to Act.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,023. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This dialogue is between Richard and Elizabeth abou t acting – the ability, which I do not have, to performing in a play, a movie, or a  television show, or a podcast. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Richard: It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why are you banging those pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I have an audition coming up and I’m reh earsing.

Richard: By banging pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I’m up for a part as a 1950s housewife. I need to learn my lines and be prepared to improvise. That’s why I’m cooking you a  10-course breakfast. I want to practice staying in character.

Richard: I don’t really want a 10-course breakfast,  but if it helps you with your audition...

Elizabeth: It will. I have to stretch my acting cho ps and really get into the head of the character.

Richard: Right. Whatever you say.

Elizabeth: “Yes, dear. Your breakfast will be ready  and waiting when you want it.” Did I project enough? Did I emote enough?

Richard: You were great. What kind of acting job is  this?

 Elizabeth: It’s a small one.

Richard: In a film?

Elizabeth: No.

Richard: In a TV show?

Elizabeth: Not exactly.

Richard: What is it?

Elizabeth: It’s a commercial. It’s only a bit part,  but you know what they say: “There are no small parts, only small actors!”

[end of dialogue]

Richard begins this dialogue by asking Elizabeth so mething. He says first, “It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why are you banging those pots and pans?” “Pots and pans” are things that you use to cook. Yo u might boil some water in a “pot” (pot) and fry some eggs in a “pan” (pan). The  question Richard has for Elizabeth is why she is banging pots and pans. “To bang” (bang) here means to make a loud noise with. Because pots and pans are b ig and often made of metal, if you move them around and hit them against other things, they may make a lot of noise.

Elizabeth says, “I have an audition coming up and I ’m rehearsing.” An “audition” (audition) is also sometimes called a “tryout” (try out). What you do on an audition is go in front of the director of a play or a movie  or a television show, and you typically will act a little bit of the movie or par t of some scene – some dialogue that will show the person if you can act or not and  if you are the person who would be best for this particular part. A “part” (p art) here just means one of the characters in the play or the movie or the TV show.

So, here in Los Angeles, for example, there are aud itions every day, in some part the city, for television shows and movies. People g o to these – actors and actresses go to these –  auditions to try to get in to the movie, to be part of the play or part of the television show. Sometimes it’s  just to be part of a commercial, an advertisement, but whatever it is, you usually h ave to go on an audition. Notice that phrasal verb “to go on.” You can “go on ” a trip, and you could “go on” an audition.

 Elizabeth is going on an audition, and so she’s reh earsing. “To rehearse” (rehearse) means to practice, especially to practic e either a speech or a performance that you are going to be giving in a pl ay or some other dramatic setting. Richard asks Elizabeth why she is banging pots and pans as part of her rehearsing, and she says, “I’m up for a part as a 1 950s housewife.” We already explained what a “part” is when we’re talking about  plays and movies. It’s the character in the play or the movie or TV show.

“To be up for” means to be under consideration for – one of the people that the people who are making the movie are considering, are thinking about. You have a good chance of getting it, or at least a chance of getting it. Elizabeth is “up for a part as a 1950s housewife.” The word “housewife” (h ousewife) – one word – describes a woman who stays at home and takes care of the house and the children. Nowadays, of course, many women, at least  in the United States, work in addition perhaps to having a family.

Elizabeth says, “I need to learn my lines and be pr epared to improvise.” Your “lines” (lines) are the words that you have to say in the movie or play. “To learn your lines,” then, means to memorize the words that  you have to say. Elizabeth is also preparing “to improvise.” “To improvise” (impr ovise) is to act or perform without having a prepared script, without having ba sically any lines prepared for you. You simply have to make it up as you go along.

“Improvisation” is very popular nowadays in comedy.  There are a lot of comedic actors, comedians, who do what we call “improv” (im prov), which is short for “improvisation,” which comes from the verb “to impr ovise” – to make something up as you go along without having planned it before .

Elizabeth says, “That’s why I’m cooking you a 10-co urse breakfast. I want to practice staying in character.” Elizabeth is cookin g Richard a “10-course (course) breakfast.” A “course,” when we’re talking about a meal, is a part of a meal. So, if you go to a nice restaurant, you may have a three-c ourse meal. The first course may be a salad or a bowl of soup. The second course  may be a piece of chicken or fish. The third course may be some vegetable or perhaps a dessert, something sweet. That would be a “three-course meal .”

Elizabeth is preparing Richard a “10-course breakfa st,” which is quite unusual. No one that I know eats 10 different things for bre akfast. Elizabeth says that she wants “to practice staying in character.” “To be in  character” means to be acting like the person in the play or the movie. So, “to s tay in character” means to

continue acting like the person in the movie even t hough you’re not filming the movie right now, even though you’re not part of the  play or the production.

This is a common technique by some actors. It’s a m ethod which is sometimes called “method acting,” in which the actor continue s to act like the person in the movie or play even though they are at home with the ir wife and children. There are some actors who are very famous for this partic ular technique or approach. Daniel Day-Lewis, for example, the great Irish acto r, is famous for staying in character when he’s making a movie – acting like the character, like the person in the movie, even when he’s not in front of the ca mera, even when they are not filming.

Richard says, “I don’t really want a 10-course brea kfast, but if it helps with your audition…” Richard is saying well, you don’t have t o cook me a 10-course breakfast, but I’ll eat it if it will help you. Eli zabeth says, “It will” – it will help her. She says, “I have to stretch my acting chops and re ally get into the head of the character.”

Your “acting chops” (chops) are your acting abiliti es. “To stretch (stretch) your acting chops” is to expand and improve them, to mak e them work in situations in which you are not normally using them. The verb “to  stretch” usually means to make something longer, but here it’s used to mean t o improve or expand. Elizabeth is trying to “get into the head of the ch aracter” that she is perhaps playing or going to play in this performance. “To g et into the head (head) of” someone means to really understand that person, to understand how that person thinks.

One of the most important things for someone who is  selling something to you, someone who is marketing a product or service, is t o “get into the head” or “get inside the head” of the person who’s buying that pr oduct or who might buy that product. This is something that actors also try to do. Richard says, “Right. Whatever you say.” Richard isn’t really all that co ncerned with Elizabeth’s logic or reasoning here.

Elizabeth responds to Richard, now in character – s he’s acting like the housewife from the 1950s. She says, “Yes, dear.” “Dear” (dear ) is a word that you would use with someone with whom you are in love. It’s a word you might use with your wife or your husband. It’s a little bit old-fashion ed. In fact, that’s why Elizabeth is using it. She’s trying to sound like someone from t he 1950s. And, of course, the expression, “Yes, dear” is meant to give you the id ea that the wife will agree with whatever the husband says. That’s the idea that Eli zabeth is trying to convey here, or get us to understand.

 She says, “Your breakfast will be ready and waiting  when you want it.” Elizabeth then asks Richard, “Did I project enough? Did I emo te enough?” “To project” (project) is to speak loudly and clearly. “To emote ” (emote) is to show emotions or feelings when you’re acting. Elizabeth is asking  Richard if she did a good job saying the sentences, “Yes, dear. Your breakfast wi ll be ready and waiting when you want it.”

Richard says, “You were great. What kind of acting job is this?” Elizabeth says, “It’s a small one.” The acting job that she’s tryin g to get is not something that is very important or big. Richard asks, “In a film?” E lizabeth says, “No.” “In a TV show?” Elizabeth says, “Not exactly.” Richard then says, “What is it?” What kind of role is this? What kind of part is this? Elizabe th says, “It’s a commercial” – it’s an advertisement. She says, “It’s only a bit part,”  meaning it’s only a small part, “but you know what they say: ‘There are no small pa rts, only small actors!’”

The expression “you know what they say” is used whe n you are going to use some common expression or common saying or popular expression. The popular expression that is used in acting sometimes is, “Th ere are no small parts, only small actors.” The idea behind the expression is th at it’s not important how big a role or part you have in a performance. A talented actor can demonstrate his or her skills even in a small role and can improve the  quality of the performance.

So, Elizabeth is going to be playing, perhaps, in a  commercial. But remember, here in Los Angeles, there are thousands of actors and actresses trying to get jobs, and so even a job in a commercial is better t han a job working at a café or a restaurant, which is where most actors and actresse s work here in L.A.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Richard: It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why are you banging those pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I have an audition coming up and I’m reh earsing.

Richard: By banging pots and pans?

Elizabeth: I’m up for a part as a 1950s housewife. I need to learn my lines and be prepared to improvise. That’s why I’m cooking you a  10-course breakfast. I want to practice staying in character.

 Richard: I don’t really want a 10-course breakfast,  but if it helps you with your audition...

Elizabeth: It will. I have to stretch my acting cho ps and really get into the head of the character.

Richard: Right. Whatever you say.

Elizabeth: “Yes, dear. Your breakfast will be ready  and waiting when you want it.” Did I project enough? Did I emote enough?

Richard: You were great. What kind of acting job is  this?

Elizabeth: It’s a small one.

Richard: In a film?

Elizabeth: No.

Richard: In a TV show?

Elizabeth: Not exactly.

Richard: What is it?

Elizabeth: It’s a commercial. It’s only a bit part,  but you know what they say: “There are no small parts, only small actors!”

This episode is a dialogue between Adrian and Teres a about managing, or handling, difficult situations. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Teresa:Hey, where are you going?We have a meeting i n 10 minutes.

Adrian:I’m sorry.I’m going to have to postpone.I’m in the middle of putting out fires, and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal wi th the latest crisis.

Teresa:Can I help?

Adrian:I wish you could.With the new layoffs, I fee l like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.As soon as I feel like I’m makin g headway with one problem, I get another thrown at me.

Teresa:I know exactly what you mean.I always feel l ike it’s crunch time around here because we’re so shorthanded.

Adrian:I’m so tired of everything being urgent all the time and needing attention ASAP.I long for the days when projects had timeline s and people followed them.I’ve got to go.

Teresa:Hey, when are we going to have that meeting?

Adrian:As soon as things quiet down.

Teresa:When will that be?

Adrian:I’ll let you know as soon as the latest disa ster has been averted.

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Teresa saying to Adrian, “ Hey, where are you going? We have a meeting in 10 minutes.” Adrian says, “I’m  sorry. I’m going to have to postpone.”“To postpone” (postpone) means to do some thing later than you had planned on or than had been originally scheduled. I t’s to change the time or even the day of something.Usuallywe postpone something w hen there’s some problem, some difficulty in doing what we were plan ning on doing.

Adrian says,“I’m in the middle of putting out fires , and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal with the latest crisis.”The expres sion “to put out” something, as a phrasal verb, means to either turn something off( for example, “I put out the lights”)or to extinguish a fire – to stop the fire from burning.“The firefighters put out the fire in the house.” Here, however, “putting  out fires” is used to mean taking care of difficult situations, taking care an d providing solutions for difficult problems – often, problems that come up without a l ot of warning.

“To clear your schedule” means to free time in your  day to cancel other things, usually so that you can spend time on, in this case , “putting out fires” – taking care of some immediate problems that must be solved  right away.A“crisis” (crisis) is a very important and urgent or immediate problem  – a problem you have to take care of or deal with right away. That’s a “cri sis.”

Well, in our dialogue, it seems that Adrian has som e sort of crisis. Teresa says,“Can I help?” Adrian says,“I wish you could,” meaning “I wish you could help, but you can’t.”He says,“With the new layoffs,  I feel like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.” A “layoff,” as a noun,  is when someone is fired from his or her job –when you lose your job.If a company  is having difficulty and it’s not making very much money, there may be layoffs – people who are, to use the verb form now,“laid off.”“To lay off” is a phrasal verb and is two words.A“layoff” as a noun is one word.

So, at Adrian’s company, it seems as though there h ave been layoffs,and this means, we’re guessing, that he has to do more work since there are fewer people working there. That’s why he says,“I feel li ke I’m being pulled in several directions at once.”“To be pulled (pulled) in sever al directions at once” means to need to do a lot of different things, especially wh en the number of things that you have to do is great. There are a lot of things that  you have to do all at the same time or with some sense of urgency.

Adrian says,“As soon as I feel like I’m making head way with one problem, I get another thrown at me.”“To make headway” (headway) i s a phrasal verb meaning to make progress, to advance toward some goal.“We’r e making headway on the paperwork we have to complete” – we’re making progr ess, we’re doing better.

Every time that Adrian feels as though he is making  headway with one problem, he says, “I get another thrown at me.”“Thrown (thro wn) at”is an expression that means “imposed on another person,” especially when it’s some responsibility that you would rather not have.“My boss has thrown sever al problems at me.” I have to take care of them.He has told me to take care of  them. “Thrown” is, obviously, the past participle of the verb “to throw.”

Teresa says,“I know exactly what you mean. I always  feel like it’s crunch time around here because we’re so shorthanded.”The phrase “crunch (crunch) time” refers to a period of time when a lot of things hav e to be completed, and you have to work really hard in order to complete them.  Many students, for example, wait until the last week of their class to do their  big project – then, it’s crunch time.They have to get a lot of things done in a sma ll amount of time. “To be shorthanded” means to not have enough people to do a job. Teresa complains that the company is shorthanded; it doesn’t have en ough employees, enough people to do all the work that needs to be done.

Adrian says,“I’m so tired of everything being urgen t all the time and needing attentionASAP.”“To be urgent” (urgent) means to nee d immediate attention – something that you have to do right away. It can’t wait – that’s urgent.In Adrian’s case, he says he’s “tired of everything being urgen t all the time and needing attention ASAP.”“ASAP” is an acronym for“as soon as  possible.”As soon as possible – without delay, in other words.

Adrian continues,“I long for the days when projects  had timelines and people followed them.”“He longs for the day” means he want s very badly to return to the time when this certain thing happened – in this cas e,“when projects had timelines and people followed them.”So, “to long for” somethi ng means to desire something, to want it a great deal.“Timelines” (tim elines) are schedules, plans about when things are going to be completed. Adrian  says,“I’ve got to go,” meaning I have to leave now.

Teresa says, “Hey, when are we going to have that m eeting?”In other words, when are we going to have the meeting that we were supposed to have in 10 minutes? Adrian says,“As soon as things quiet down. ”“To quiet (quiet) down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become calmer, to not be rushing so much.“To rush” (rush) means to go fast.So, to be re laxed, to be calm.

Sometimeswe use this phrasal verb to mean to not ta lk so loud or to be quiet.“To quiet down a group of students” would be to get the  students to stop talking so loudly. Teachers have to do that all the time.

Teresa says,“When will that be?”That is, when will things quiet down? Adrian says,“I’ll let you know as soon as the latest disas ter has been averted.”A“disaster”(disaster)is a serious, large p roblem that has very negative consequences. We sometimes talk about “natural disa sters”– that would be an earthquake or a flood or a big snowstorm. These thi ngs cause damage and therefore have negative consequences. You can also have a disaster in your own life; something bad could happen to you. Maybe you lose your cat. Would that be a disaster?Maybe.Not for me.

The verb“to avert” (avert) means to prevent somethi ng from happening or to avoid something.You’ll often hear this verb or see this verb in writing with the word “disaster.”“We’re trying to avert a disaster”–  we’re trying to prevent something bad from happening.Adrian is saying here that he won’t have time, until there are no crises, to meet with Teresa.

Now let’s listento the dialogue, this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Teresa:Hey, where are you going?We have a meeting i n 10 minutes.

Adrian:I’m sorry.I’m going to have to postpone.I’m in the middle of putting out fires, and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal wi th the latest crisis.

Teresa:Can I help?

Adrian:I wish you could.With the new layoffs, I fee l like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.As soon as I feel like I’m makin g headway with one problem, I get another thrown at me.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,025 – Maintaining Internet Privacy.

This episode is a dialogue between Lorenzo and Pame la about something that a lot of people are talking about nowadays: Internet privacy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t post all of those photos on soc ial media sites.

Pamela: Why not? Only my friends and family are going to see them.

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t be so sure. And I wouldn’t post  all of that personal data either, or divulge personal information. You don’t know who may gain access to your page.

Pamela: There are privacy safeguards on this websit e. I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.

Lorenzo: Well, the people who run the website itsel f have access. They could track what you do and what you post, and extract da ta from your page to sell to third-party buyers.

Pamela: No, they can’t do that. I’d know if they we re doing that.

Lorenzo: How?

Pamela: Well . . .

Lorenzo: As I said, that’s happening as we speak. A nd those are the legitimate uses of your information. Hackers can gain access, too, with malicious intent. They can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.

Pamela: So, what should I do?

Lorenzo: Take down most of your posts and photos, a t least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.

Pamela: But that would mean no one would know anyth ing about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring page.

Lorenzo: It’s either risk being boring or risk an i nvasion of your privacy.

Pamela: Wow, what a dilemma!

[end of dialogue]

Lorenzo begins our dialogue by saying to Pamela, “I  wouldn’t post all of those photos on social media sites.” Notice, Lorenzo begi ns here with a conditional, “I wouldn’t” – I would not. The idea is, “If I were yo u, I would not do this.” It’s a way of giving someone advice. Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t  post” – that is, put up on a website, or upload – “all of those photos on social  media sites.”

“Social (social) media” refers to websites where pe ople share personal information, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedI n. Those are three popular social media sites now as we record this episode, a lthough that changes quite quickly on the Internet. Pamela says, “Why not? Onl y my friends and family are going to see them.” Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t be so  sure.” Once again he uses that “wouldn’t,” or “would not,” construction. He’s  saying, “If I were you, I wouldn’t be so sure.” It’s a way here of expressing doubt.

Lorenzo says, “I wouldn’t post all of that personal  data either, or divulge personal information.” The word “data,” (data), which can al so be pronounced “DAY-ta,” is information; it’s information about something. “Per sonal data” would be information about your life – perhaps your birthday  or your government registration number, which here in the United State s is called your “social security number.” That’s personal data.

Strictly speaking, “data” is a plural noun, althoug h it is often used now as a singular noun. So, you should say “data are” instea d of “data is,” but the singular of data, which is “datum” (datum), is not used very  much anymore. So, we’ve sort

of lost that distinction between the singular and t he plural. Lorenzo says that Pamela should not “divulge” personal information. “ To divulge” (divulge) means to share something private or secret with someone e lse – to tell someone something that you consider very personal or privat e.

Lorenzo says, “You don’t know who may gain access t o your page.” “To gain (gain) access (access)” means to obtain the ability  to see something that would normally be hidden or secret. So, for example, your  email account is something that normally only you look at, but if you gave you r username and password to another person, that person could gain access to yo ur account and see all of your emails.

Pamela says, “There are privacy safeguards on this site.” “Privacy” (privacy) refers to things that are secret or hidden or priva te. The word “safeguard” (safeguard) refers to something that is supposed to  protect you or protect, in this case, information. “Privacy safeguards” would be th ings that protect your personal data, your personal information, so that no one else can see it.

Pamela says, “I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.” “To block”  (block) someone from doing something means to not allow someone to do somethin g – to prevent someone from doing something. Pamela says she can block any one from getting access to her website “so no one can see what I post without permission.” “Permission” (permission) is the right to have, see, or do somet hing. We might also use the word “authorization” or “consent” (consent).

Lorenzo says, “Well, the people who run the website  itself have access.” He’s telling Pamela that Facebook and Twitter and other social media websites can see your information – the people at the company, t he people who own those websites, can see your personal information. Lorenz o says, “They could track what you do and what you post and extract data from  your page to sell to third- party buyers.” “To track” (track) means to observe something, usually over a long period of time – “to monitor,” we might also say to  express the same idea.

“To extract” (extract) something is to take somethi ng out of a larger body or to remove a part of something. If you’re going to extr act data, you are going to be taking pieces of information from a larger list of information or, in this case, from a website or web page. Of course, many websites tak e your information and use it in certain ways. The most common way would be to  sell that information to “third-party buyers.” “Third (third) – party (party )” refers to an organization or a person who is not part of, in this case, the compan y.

So, if Facebook takes your information and sells it  to another advertising company, the advertising company would be considere d a third party. The word “party” is not just a noun for a celebration like a  birthday party. It is also used in legal situations, or when we’re talking about the l aw, to refer to a person or company. There are two parties in any lawsuit. One party, one person or group, is trying to get money from another person or group . Those are the two parties involved.

Pamela says, “No, they can’t do that. I’d know if t hey were doing that.” Lorenzo asks, “How?” Pamela says, “Well . . .” In other wor ds, Pamela here is saying that if one of these websites takes her information, she  will know about it, but Lorenzo asks, “How?” How will you know? Then he continues, “As I said, that’s happening as we speak,” meaning right now, “and those are the  legitimate uses of your information.” “Legitimate” (legitimate) means real or allowed. Sometimes we use the word also to mean “not false” or “not fake.”

Lorenzo is saying that websites can already do this  with your information. Then he adds, “Hackers can gain access, too, with malici ous intent.” A “hacker” (hacker) is a person who uses their knowledge of co mputers to gain access to secret information on your web page or on your own computer. Hackers often have malicious intent. “Malicious” (malicious) mean s bad or evil. “Malicious intent” would be having plans to do bad things.

Lorenzo says, “They,” meaning the hackers, “can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.” Pamela then asks, “So , what should I do?” Lorenzo advises her to “take down most of your post s and photos, at least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.” “To take d own” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning in this case to delete or remove somet hing from a website.

Pamela says, “But that would mean no one would know  anything about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring pag e.” “Worse yet” is a phrase we used to emphasize that something is bad, especia lly as an example of something that is even worse than what you are talk ing about. So, if a bad thing is being described and then you want to talk about something that is even worse, you might use that expression to introduce the next  topic: “Worse yet . . .”

Pamela here is saying that if she removed all of he r posts and photos that she would have a very boring, or uninteresting, web pag e on this particular media site. Lorenzo says, “It’s either risk being boring or risk an invasion of your privacy.” Lorenzo is saying that Pamela has two cho ices: either she can have a boring page, or she can perhaps have her privacy in vaded.

An “invasion” (invasion) of your privacy is when yo ur personal information is obtained and/or used by other people, often for som ething that you would not want it used for. Many people think, for example, t hat if the government is listening to your cell phone conversations, that th at is an invasion of privacy. Not that any government would ever do that, right?

Pamela ends our dialogue by saying, “Wow, what a di lemma.” A “dilemma” (dilemma) is a difficult problem or situation where  the solution or the answer isn’t clear. You’re not sure what to do or how you should  make a decision about this problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t post all of those photos on soc ial media sites.

Pamela: Why not? Only my friends and family are going to see them.

Lorenzo: I wouldn’t be so sure. And I wouldn’t post  all of that personal data either, or divulge personal information. You don’t know who may gain access to your page.

Pamela: There are privacy safeguards on this websit e. I can block anyone I don’t know from getting access, so no one can see what I post without permission.

Lorenzo: Well, the people who run the website itsel f have access. They could track what you do and what you post, and extract da ta from your page to sell to third-party buyers.

Pamela: No, they can’t do that. I’d know if they we re doing that.

Lorenzo: How?

Pamela: Well . . .

Lorenzo: As I said, that’s happening as we speak. A nd those are the legitimate uses of your information. Hackers can gain access, too, with malicious intent. They can do a lot of damage with the personal data you’ve posted.

Pamela: So, what should I do?

 Lorenzo: Take down most of your posts and photos, a t least the ones you wouldn’t want everyone to see.

Pamela: But that would mean no one would know anyth ing about me. Worse yet, it would mean having a really boring page.

Lorenzo: It’s either risk being boring or risk an i nvasion of your privacy.

Pamela: Wow, what a dilemma!

# Marrying Young

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,026 – Marrying Young.

This episode is a dialogue between Irene and Ken ab out people getting married. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Irene: Damon and his girlfriend just got engaged. T hey’re planning on getting married this summer.

Ken: They’re too young! Marrying young poses all ki nds of problems.

Irene: Such as?

Ken: Such as the two of them lacking maturity. They  may think it’s fun to play house right now, but they’re not prepared to face t he realities and responsibilities of matrimony.

Irene: I think you’re selling them short. They’ve b een dating for two years, and there’s no ideal age for marriage.

Ken: Yes, but we all know that marrying young will doom them to a life of regrets.

Irene: That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think? A lot of people who marry young have successful marriages. I like the idea of growing ol d with your spouse. You can reach many of life’s milestones together.

Ken: Like reaching the legal drinking age?

Irene: Don’t be facetious. Getting married will giv e them stability and someone to lean on. I think they’ll be great as a married coup le.

 Ken: Well, I hope they beat the odds . . . or at le ast learn a lot for their second marriages.

[end of dialogue]

We begin this dialogue with Irene saying to Ken, “D amon and his girlfriend just got engaged. They are planning on getting married t his summer.” “To get engaged” (engaged) means to promise and make plans to marry someone. Normally, you get engaged at least a few months bef ore you get married. Some people get engaged a year or even more before they actually do marry, but “to be engaged” means to be promised, if you will, to a nother – that you have promised to marry another person.

Irene says that Damon and his girlfriend are planni ng on getting married this summer. “To get married,” of course, means to becom e husband and wife, to be legally recognized as a married couple. In many pla ces, marriage is both a “civil” – that is, government – action as well as a religio us action. You may get married in a church or a temple or some other religious ins titution. You can also get married by going down to the government office and getting something called a “marriage license.”

One does not necessarily imply the other. That is, just because you get married by the government doesn’t mean you’re married in a religious sense. You can have one without the other, or both. However, in the U.S., if you are married by someone who is considered a religious leader, such as a rabbi or a minister or a priest, you will be considered married by the gover nment as well. The government allows religious leaders, if you will, t o officially witness the marriage of two people. But let’s get back to our story and Damon and his girlfriend.

Ken says to Irene, “They’re too young! Marrying you ng poses all kinds of problems.” “To pose” (pose) means to present. We of ten use this verb when talking about problems. You’ll hear people say, “Th is poses a problem for us,” meaning this introduces a problem into this situati on. Ken believes that marrying young – getting married when you are young – poses all kinds of problems. We’re not exactly sure what Ken means by “young” he re. Irene asks what kind of problems marrying young poses. She says, “Such as?”  meaning she’s asking Ken to give her some examples.

Ken says, “Such as the two of them lacking maturity .” “Maturity” (maturity) is having the outlook and perspective of a responsible  person – an adult, if you will. We talk about children maturing. They’re getting ol der and, we hope, getting

wiser. Teenagers often lack maturity. That is, they  don’t have the responsible perspective of an adult.

Ken says, “They may think it’s fun to play house ri ght now, but they’re not prepared to face the realities and responsibilities  of matrimony.” The expression “to play house” (house) means to, in a way, pretend  that you’re living together. It’s a game that children sometimes play. When litt le girls get together and play house, they pretend as though they are wives and mo thers or women who are living in their own house and responsible for the h ouse. And so they do things that might traditionally be done by someone who is married.

So, Ken is making a little joke here. He’s saying t hat Damon and his girlfriend are playing house just like a child would, even though the child doesn’t understand the full responsibility of being married. Ken says that these two are “not prepared to face the realities and responsibilities of matri mony.” “To face” (face) something means to understand it and to deal with it – to be able to, we might also say, “confront” something. You have to look at a difficu lt situation and figure out how to deal with it.

The word “matrimony” (matrimony) means marriage. It ’s the state of being married. Irene says that she thinks Ken is “selling  them short.” “To sell someone short” means to underestimate someone’s good qualit ies, to think someone is worse than they really are. In this case, Irene thi nks that Ken is selling Damon and his girlfriend short by saying that they are no t mature enough to get married.

Irene says, “They’ve been dating for two years, and  there is no ideal age for marriage.” “Ideal” (ideal) here means perfect, or c ompletely appropriate. The “ideal age” to get married would be the best age to  get married. Here in the United States in recent years, people have been get ting married later and later, and in many cases not getting married at all.

But, back to our fictional dialogue. Ken says, “Yes , but we all know that marrying young will doom them to a life of regrets.” “To doo m” (doom) someone is to make your future very dark. If you are “doomed,” somethi ng very bad will happen to you in the future, maybe even death. Of course, dea th will happen to all of us sometime in the future. I hope not too soon, at lea st not for me.

Ken thinks that marrying young will basically ruin Damon and his girlfriend’s lives. It “will doom them,” he says, “to a life of regrets .” “Regrets” (regrets) are things that you wish you had not done. For example, I regr et not talking to my neighbor last week. I wish I had spoken with him. “To regret ” something, as a verb, means

to feel badly that you didn’t do a certain thing, o r perhaps that you did do a certain thing.

Here it’s being used as a noun meaning that situati on where you feel badly about something that you did or didn’t do. “I regret not going up to that beautiful girl and asking her for her telephone number.” That’s someth ing I did a lot of when I was in my 20s. I finally got a little bit smarter and d ecided to start asking women out on dates, but that wasn’t until after I was 30, rea lly. I’m someone who married very late in life. Well, later than the average man  marries in the U.S. Anyway, it’s not about me, is it, really. It’s about our dialogu e. So, back to the dialogue.

Irene says to Ken, “That’s a bit harsh, don’t you t hink?” Ken is saying that poor Damon and his girlfriend will have a terrible life,  and she’s saying, “No, that’s a bit harsh” (harsh). “To be harsh” means to be mean, to be too critical. She continues, “A lot of people who marry young have su ccessful marriages. I like the idea of growing old with your spouse.” “To grow old ” means to experience life as you get older. All of us, of course, grow old. Iren e is talking about growing old with your spouse, the person you’re married to.

She says, “You can reach many of life’s milestones together.” A “milestone” (milestone) is an important event or accomplishment  in life, in this case. You can have a milestone in a project at work – things that  you want to get done by this date, or this date. Ken says, “Like reaching the le gal drinking age?” Irene is talking about important events in one’s life, and K en gives an example of one: the legal drinking age.

In the U.S., the legal drinking age is 21, which me ans that Damon and his girlfriend are not yet 21 years old. Normally, peop le wait until after they’re 21 to get married, and that’s probably why Ken is in a wa y making a joke with Irene, saying, “These kids are so young, they can’t even d rink legally.”

But Irene says, “Don’t be facetious.” “To be faceti ous” (facetious) means to not take something seriously – to joke about something.  Irene says, “Getting married will give them stability and someone to lean on.” “ Stability” (stability) is a position where things don’t change. Irene is saying that if these two people get married, they will have stability and each will have someone  to lean on. “To lean (lean) on” someone is a phrasal verb meaning to rely on someon e, to depend on someone for support and advice and help.

Ken says, “Well, I hope they beat the odds.” “To be at (beat) the odds (odds)” means to do better than what you might expect. He’s  suggesting that it will be difficult for them to have a happy marriage since a  lot of people who get married

very young sometimes don’t have successful marriage s, although I’m not sure exactly what the statistics are on that, really.

But in any case, Ken thinks that they don’t have a very good chance at a marriage if they get married very young. He then en ds by saying, “Or at least learn a lot for their second marriages.” He’s sugge sting that their first marriage won’t last. That is, they’ll get divorced and then they’ll marry again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Irene: Damon and his girlfriend just got engaged. T hey’re planning on getting married this summer.

Ken: They’re too young! Marrying young poses all ki nds of problems.

Irene: Such as?

Ken: Such as the two of them lacking maturity. They  may think it’s fun to play house right now, but they’re not prepared to face t he realities and responsibilities of matrimony.

Irene: I think you’re selling them short. They’ve b een dating for two years, and there’s no ideal age for marriage.

Ken: Yes, but we all know that marrying young will doom them to a life of regrets.

Irene: That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think? A lot of people who marry young have successful marriages. I like the idea of growing ol d with your spouse. You can reach many of life’s milestones together.

Ken: Like reaching the legal drinking age?

Irene: Don’t be facetious. Getting married will giv e them stability and someone to lean on. I think they’ll be great as a married coup le.

Ken: Well, I hope they beat the odds . . . or at le ast learn a lot for their second marriages.

# Adding Condiments to Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,027 – Adding Condiments to Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,027. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Orlando and Janine about making your food taste better by adding condi ments. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Orlando: Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

Janine: Here. You’re not putting that on your burge r, are you?

Orlando: No, I’m using it for my hot dog.

Janine: Wait. You’ve put ketchup, mustard, mayonnai se, and barbecue sauce on your burger, and now you’re going to put Worcesters hire sauce on your hot dog?

Orlando: Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestershire sa uce on your hot dog.

Janine: No, I don’t. I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.

Orlando: You’re missing out. I just need to add a l ittle steak sauce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this ho t dog is ready to eat.

Janine: That sounds disgusting! Is there anything y ou won’t put on your food?

Orlando: On this food? Maybe maple syrup.

Janine: What?! You’re the one missing out. Hand me that syrup.

Orlando: That is truly revolting!

Janine: To each his own.

[end of dialogue]

Orlando begins this dialogue by saying to Janine, “ Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.” “Worcestershire (Worcestershire) sauce (sau ce)” is a special kind of liquid made from vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, what  are called “anchovies” – which are basically small fish – and it is used often in cooking beef. Notice that the pronunciation of this word is not like the spelling . You would think it would be pronounced something like “Worchestershire” sauce, but it isn’t. It is from the town of “Worcester” in England, and that’s how it’s  pronounced.

So, we say “Worcestershire sauce.” Personally, I do n’t really like it, but Orlando does, so Janine says to Orlando, “Here,” meaning “H ere, take it.” She’s giving him the bottle. Janine says, “You’re not putting th at on your burger, are you?” “Burger” (burger) is the same as “hamburger” – a be ef patty that is very popular in the U.S. and other countries. Orlando says, “No,  I’m using it for my hot dog.”

A “hot dog” is basically a small sausage that is us ually placed inside of a piece of bread called a “bun.” We have “hot dog buns” – brea d that is made especially for eating hot dogs – and “hamburger buns.” Janine says , “Wait, you put ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and barbecue sauce on your bur ger, and now you’re going to put Worcestershire sauce on your hot dog?”

Janine mentions several different things that Orlan do has put on his hamburger. All of these things that we’ve been talking about, including Worcestershire sauce, are called in general “condiments” (condiments). Th ese are things you put on your food to make them taste better, usually after it is cooked. Some examples of condiments are mentioned here: ketchup, mustard, ma yonnaise, and barbecue sauce.

“Ketchup” (ketchup) is a thick red sauce made from tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar, and a few other things, that is usually used  in the U.S. when you are eating French fries. Some people, like me, love eat ing French fries, which are deep-fried pieces of potato, with ketchup. Many peo ple, including me, also like to put ketchup on a hamburger to improve its taste.

“Mustard” (mustard) is a thick yellow or brown sauc e that is made from mustard seeds as well as vinegar, salt, and a few other thi ngs. “Mayonnaise” (mayonnaise) is a thick, white, creamy sauce made b y mixing oil and the yellow

part of an egg – what we call the “egg yolk” (yolk)  – vinegar, lemon juice, and a few other things together, and it produces somethin g wonderful called “mayonnaise.”

Finally, there is “barbecue (barbecue) sauce.” Barb ecue sauce is a thick, dark brown liquid that is usually sweet and is used to c ook certain kinds of meat on what we call a “barbecue,” which is basically an op en flame with a “grill” over it – a series of metal bars that you put the food on. Yo u can put barbecue sauce on chicken, on pork ribs – the piece of meat that come s from a pig. Lots of different things can be used with barbecue sauce. It’s very p opular in the U.S. for grilling food outside, especially.

Orlando says, “Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestersh ire sauce on your hot dog.” Now, I personally never eat this kind of sauce, I t hink I mentioned, but Orlando wants it on his hot dog. Janine disagrees with Orla ndo. She says, “No, I don’t,” meaning “I don’t have to have that sauce on my hot dog.” She continues, “I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.”

Orlando says, “You’re missing out.” “To miss (miss)  out” is to not to experience something – not to have an opportunity to do someth ing or see something that is good or pleasurable. “I missed out on the baseball game last night.” I didn’t have an opportunity to see it. “To miss out” is to lose an opportunity to see or participate in something good. Orlando is telling J anine that she is missing out on the great taste of putting this sauce on hot dogs.

He continues, “I just need to add a little steak sa uce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this hot dog is ready  to eat.” Orlando gives us another list of condiments that are common with som e Americans. The first one is “steak sauce.” “Steak sauce” is a dark brown sau ce – made from tomatoes, vinegar, I think raisins, and a few other things – that is sometimes used on steak.

Now, many people think that steak sauce ruins the t aste of steak. Other people think that it helps the taste of steak, especially if the steak is somewhat overcooked, I think. I don’t personally use steak s auce on my steak, but if you go to some restaurants in the U.S., they will give you  steak sauce with your steak if you want it.

“Horseradish” (horseradish) is a thick, somewhat sp icy, white-colored sauce – or, it’s not exactly white, but it’s close to white. It ’s made from vinegar and the part of a plant called “horseradish.” There’s a horseradish  plant, which I believe is a kind of cabbage. Horseradish sauce is very popular on ho t dogs in the U.S. Again, I don’t like it very much, so I don’t put anything on  my hot dogs like horseradish.

 “Tartar (tartar) sauce” is a thick, creamy, white s auce that is often used with fried seafood – things like fried fish. It’s made from ma yonnaise, lemon juice, I believe there’s some pickles in there, as well as other ing redients. Tartar sauce is very common when eating fried fish.

“Chili sauce” is the last thing that Orlando mentio ns. “Chili (chili) sauce” is a hot sauce usually made from spicy peppers as well as vi negar, salt, and a few other things. It’s usually red. If you like your food spi cy, and I don’t, then you could put a dab of chili sauce on it. “A dab” (dab) of someth ing is a little bit. It’s a small amount of something.

Janine, however, says to Orlando, “That sounds disg usting.” When we say something is “disgusting” (disgusting), we mean it is very unappealing. It’s something that would make you sick. It’s something that we might also describe as being “gross” (gross). It’s a very negative way to describe food, in particular. Janine says, “Is there anything you won’t put on yo ur food?”

Orlando says, “On this food?” He says, “Maybe maple  syrup.” “Maple” (maple) is a kind of tree which is very popular in Canada. In fact, one of the symbols of Canada, our neighbor to the north, is a maple leaf from the maple tree. From a maple tree, you get something called “maple syrup” (syrup), which is a thick, sweet, brown liquid that is made from maple trees –  technically from what is called the “sap” (sap) of a maple tree, which is the liquid inside of a tree.

Maple syrup is often used on breakfast dishes such as pancakes, French toast, and other kinds of breakfast foods. It’s very sweet . Orlando says he wouldn’t put maple syrup on his hot dog or hamburger. Janine is surprised by this. She says, “What? You’re the one missing out,” meaning now you  are the one who is missing a good opportunity to taste something good.  She says, “Hand me that syrup.”

So Janine, after complaining about all the things t hat Orlando is putting on his food, is now going to put maple syrup on her hambur ger or hot dog. Now that really is very unusual, and Orlando describes how t he average American would probably react to that combination of beef and mapl e syrup by saying, “That is truly revolting.” “Revolting” (revolting) means the  same as here as “disgusting” – something that is very gross, especially, again, re ferring to food.

Janine then ends with a common expression: “To each  his own.” “To each his own” means everybody likes something different. Eac h person has his or her

own tastes and what you may like, I may hate. This is true with my wife and me. If she likes something, I usually hate it when it c omes to food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Orlando: Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

Janine: Here. You’re not putting that on your burge r, are you?

Orlando: No, I’m using it for my hot dog.

Janine: Wait. You’ve put ketchup, mustard, mayonnai se, and barbecue sauce on your burger, and now you’re going to put Worcesters hire sauce on your hot dog?

Orlando: Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestershire sa uce on your hot dog.

Janine: No, I don’t. I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.

Orlando: You’re missing out. I just need to add a l ittle steak sauce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this ho t dog is ready to eat.

Janine: That sounds disgusting! Is there anything y ou won’t put on your food?

Orlando: On this food? Maybe maple syrup.

Janine: What?! You’re the one missing out. Hand me that syrup.

Orlando: That is truly revolting!

Janine: To each his own.

# Describing Order and Sequence

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,028 – Describing Order and Sequence.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,028 I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download the Learning Guide for this ep isode that gives you a complete transcript of everything we say. If there’ s something you didn’t understand, you can just look at the transcript. Go  to our website for more information.

This episode is called “Describing Order and Sequen ce.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patrick: Okay, your first task is to put all of the se files in order.

Maya: Wow, there must be hundreds of files in this storeroom. How am I supposed to organize them?

Patrick: Create a basic filing system. Put things i n sequence. If they’re labeled with dates, put them in chronological order. If the y’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.

Maya: Okay, but what about this file? It’s labeled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.

Patrick: Those are case numbers. Put those in ascen ding or descending numeric order, whichever makes sense.

Maya: But this file has letters followed by numbers .

Patrick: Then put those in alphanumeric order, firs t by letter and then by number. Simple, right?

Maya: Yeah, but have you ever considered a more ran dom filing system, something that embraces chaos?

Patrick: No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’d just  go home to my 11 children!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Patrick saying to Maya, “Okay, your first task is to put all of these files in order.” The word “task” (task ) is very commonly used in the business world to refer to some piece of work that has to be completed – some small job or some small project. Sometimes a projec t has a number of different tasks – a number of different steps or things that have to be done. Patrick is giving Maya a task. He’s telling her to “put all of  these files in order.” “To put something in order” means to move them around so th at they are logically arranged, so that they are organized.

For example, you can put things in alphabetical ord er. That would be starting with “A, B, C, D” in order according to the English alph abet. So, “B” comes before “D,” and “D” comes before “M,” and so forth. There are a ll sorts of ways you can organize something, of course. Patrick is telling M aya to put the files in order. Usually a “file” on a computer is an electronic doc ument. However, in the old days when people used paper, files were things that  you put papers into in order to organize them.

Maya says, “Wow, there must be hundreds of files in  this storeroom.” A “storeroom” (storeroom) is another word for a “ware house” (warehouse). A storeroom, or a warehouse, is basically a large roo m that you keep things in, that you store things in. “To store,” as a verb, means t o put aside, to keep in a place until you’re ready to use it. Maya says there are h undreds of files, paper files, in this storeroom. So she asks Patrick, “How am I supp osed to organize them?”

Patrick says, “Create a basic filing system.” A “fi ling system” would be some sort of logical, organized way that you store or keep ei ther your paper or your digital files. “Digital files” are usually kept in folders.  Just like we have paper folders, you also have digital folders, and that’s the word we w ould use in English to describe a place where you would collect a number of differe nt kinds of files that were similar.

A “filing system,” then, is some way of organizing something. For example, for me, when I buy something, especially a piece of com puter equipment or electronic equipment, I make a paper folder or I cr eate a label, a name that I put on the folder, that says “Hardware: ” and then the name of the object, and then I put all of those together in my filing cabinet, whi ch is a place where you keep paper files. That is my, or part of my, filing syst em.

Patrick tells Maya to “put things in sequence.” “Se quence” (sequence) is another word for order – usually it involves putting the ea rliest things before the latest things. Patrick says, “If they are labeled with dat es, put them in chronological order.” “To label” something is to put a name on so mething, to provide basic information about something with what we would call  a “tag” (tag) or a “sticker” (sticker). On a paper file, that would be a little piece of paper that goes on the folder or just words that you write on the folder i tself to identify.

“Chronological order” refers to putting things in t he earliest to latest sequence – that is, if you are putting things in chronological  order, you would put 2010 before 2011, and 2011 would come before 2012. You would pu t January before March. Patrick says, “If they’re labeled with names, put t hem in alphabetical order by last name.” “Alphabetical order,” as we explained earlie r, is when you put things in the order of, in this case, the English alphabet: A , B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. Like that.

Maya says, “Okay, but what about this file? It’s la beled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.” A “digit” (digit) is one writ ten number from zero to nine. So, what Maya is saying is that this particular file ha s four numbers. She could just say it’s labeled with “four numbers.” To say it’s l abeled with a “four-digit number” means the same thing. A “digit” is, as I mentioned,  in this case a number from zero to nine.

Patrick says, “Those are case numbers. Put those in  ascending or descending numerical order, whichever makes sense.” “Numeric” (numeric) comes from the word “number.” So, “numeric order” would be putting  things in order of the number that appears on them. “Ascending” (ascending ) means putting the smallest numbers first, before the largest numbers,  or the largest values after the smallest values.

So, if you have four objects – one is labeled “7,” one is labeled “15,” and one is labeled “25” – to put them in “ascending numeric or der” would be to put the 7 before the 15 before the 25. The opposite would be “descending order.” “Descending (descending) order” is when you put the  largest values first, the largest numbers first. So, in our example, it would  be 25, 15, 7. That would be in descending order. “To ascend,” as a verb, means to go up; “to descend” means to go down.

Maya says “But this file has letters followed by nu mbers.” So, the file may be has something like “B-29” or “C748.” Patrick says, “The n put those in alphanumeric order, first, by letter and then by number. “Alphan umeric order” is used when you have both letters and numbers, or words and numbers  together. “Alpha” refers to

alphabetical. “Numeric,” of course, refers to numbe rs. So, “alphanumeric” would be first to put it in alphabetical order, and then you put it in numerical order.

So, for example, if you have “A29” and “A78,” if yo u’re putting them in ascending alphanumeric order you would put “A29” before “A78. ” If you were putting them in descending alphanumeric order, you would put “A78” before A . . . what did I say? 29? Something like that.

Maya says, “Yeah, but have you ever considered a mo re random filing system, something that embraces chaos?” Maya, perhaps, is m aking a joke here. She asks Patrick if he’s ever considered a “random” (ra ndom) filing system. Something that is random is something that is unpre dictable. It is based not on any sort of logic or order, but basically on chance  or luck. Of course, that wouldn’t be any sort of system it all, if it were j ust based on luck or chance.

Maya is suggesting that Patrick have a random filin g system that “embraces chaos.” “Chaos” (chaos) is the opposite of order. I f you looked at my desk right now, for example, and I’m looking at it right now, it is chaos. There is no order. I have papers over here and papers over there. It dri ves my wife crazy – but enough about me.

To finish the dialogue, we will explain what Maya m eans by “embraces.” “To embrace” (embrace) here means to welcome something with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a lot of joy and happiness. Maya i s suggesting that Patrick create a file system that would embrace chaos – that would  be based on, if you will, chance.

Patrick says, “No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’ d go home to my 11 children.” Patrick says that if he wants disorder, he can go h ome to his 11 children. If you have 11 children in one house, you would have a lot  of chaos, a lot of disorder. I know, of course, because I come from a family of 11  children, and there was a lot of chaos when I was growing up.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patrick: Okay, your first task is to put all of the se files in order.

Maya: Wow, there must be hundreds of files in this storeroom. How am I supposed to organize them?

Patrick: Create a basic filing system. Put things i n sequence. If they’re labeled with dates, put them in chronological order. If the y’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.

Maya: Okay, but what about this file? It’s labeled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.

Maya: Yeah, but have you ever considered a more ran dom filing system, something that embraces chaos?

Patrick: No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’d just  go home to my 11 children!

# Types of Vandalism

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,029 – Types of Vandalism.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,029. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this and all of our c urrent episodes. You can also like us on Facebook at facebook.com/eslpod. This ep isode is a dialogue about vandalism – when someone does something to damage s omeone else’s property. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jim: Did you hear what happened to the Romeros?

Helene: No, what?

Jim: They went on vacation for a week and vandals b roke a couple of windows in the back of their house and tagged their living roo m walls with graffiti.

Helene: That’s terrible! There are always punks who  like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun, but this is much more serious .

Jim: I think things are getting out of hand. Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slashed or t heir cars keyed.

Helene: And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds tramp led and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago. This neighborhood is re ally going downhill.

Jim: What should we do about it?

Helene: What do you mean?

Jim: I think we should start patrolling the streets  at night.

Helene: You mean organize a neighborhood watch? Wou ldn’t that be dangerous?

Jim: If you’re worried, when you see something susp icious, call the police.

Helene: And you think they’ll come in time to catch  them? The police aren’t known for quick response times in this neighborhood .

Jim: Then we’ll go after them ourselves.

Helene: You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that w ould be wise.

Jim: Why not? If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I . Go ahead, punk, make my day!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jim saying to Helene, “Did  you hear what happened to the Romeros?” The “Romeros” refers to a family with  the last name of “Romero.” Notice we put an “s” at the end. That’s very common  if you are referring to an entire family. So, my family might be referred to a s the “McQuillans,” with an “s” at the end. You could also say “the McQuillan famil y.”

Helene says, “No, what?” What happened? Jim says, “ They went on vacation for a week and vandals broke a couple of windows in the  back of their house and tagged their living room walls with graffiti. The R omeros went on a vacation, and while they were gone, “vandals broke a couple of wi ndows.” A “vandal” (vandal) is a criminal who destroys or damages someone’s pro perty, something that belongs to someone else.

These vandals broke a couple of windows in the back  of the Romeros’ house and “tagged” their living room walls with graffiti. “To  tag” (tag) here refers to painting your name or your organization’s name or symbol on a wall. This is something that, unfortunately, you see a lot in big cities al l around the world, usually young men who go around with paint cans and put their nam e – or, often, strange symbols – on public walls or the walls of buildings .

“Graffiti” (graffiti) refers to either writing or d rawing that is placed illegally or without permission on someone’s wall. It could be a lso on someone’s vehicle – on your car, for example. Helene says, “That’s terr ible. There are always punks who like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun , but this is much more serious.”

The word “punk” (punk) here refers to a young perso n – again, often young men or young boys who break the law and do other things  to bother people around

them. It’s a negative way of describing someone. “P unk” also refers, of course, to a kind of music from the late 1970s, when I was in high school.

Helene says, “There are always punks who like to eg g houses.” “To egg” (egg) means to throw eggs at a building. You’re obviously  throwing raw eggs – eggs that have not been cooked – and of course, if you t hrow an egg against the wall, it’s going to break and make a mess. So, the verb “ to egg” means to throw eggs, but not in a good way (although I’m not sure if the re is a good way to throw eggs at something) but rather in order to create a mess and to damage the wall.

Sometimes, not that often, young people as a joke w ill egg someone’s house. It’s a very bad thing to do. The other thing that young people do sometimes – although I, of course, have never done this – is to  TP someone’s house. “To TP” means to take toilet paper – which is also called “ TP paper” – and throw it on someone’s house, or often on a tree or a bush aroun d someone’s house. Helene says this is much more serious than just egging som eone’s house, because they actually broke into the house.

Jim says, “I think things are getting out of hand.”  The expression “to get out of hand” means to become out of control or to become a  serious problem. We use this expression when a situation seems to be slowly  getting worse until such a point where the problem becomes serious. Jim says, “Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slas hed or their cars keyed.” An “incident” is a case of, an event.

In this case, we’re talking about cases of people h aving their tires “slashed.” “To have your tires slashed” (slashed) is to have someo ne take a knife or some sharp object and punch a hole in your tire so that you don’t have any air left in your tire. “To key (key) someone’s car” is to take a key, any key, and walk along the side of the car and scrape the paint off of the  car. Of course, both slashing tires and keying cars would damage a car. It’s cert ainly not something nice to do. You are, in fact, ruining the property of the perso n.

Helene says, “And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds  trampled and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago.” A “flower bed” is an area in your lawn or in your garden where there are flowers. “To trample” ( trample) means to step on something, especially a plant, and in doing so kill  the plant or at least flatten the plant so that it is no longer sticking up out of the ground.

Helene continues, “This neighborhood is really goin g downhill.” The expression “to go downhill” (downhill) means to become worse. When you’re talking about a situation going downhill, you are referring to a si tuation that is becoming worse,

that is deteriorating. “To deteriorate” means the s ame as to go downhill – to become worse. Jim then asks, “What should we do abo ut it?” Helene says, “What do you mean?”

Jim says, “I think we should start patrolling the s treets at night.” “To patrol” (patrol) means to either walk or drive around an ar ea to make sure that no one is causing any problems – to look for dangerous or ill egal activities. Normally, we talk about the police patrolling an area to make su re that it is safe. In fact, we call the cars that police drive around “patrol cars” bec ause they are out patrolling. They’re out looking to make sure that the area is s afe. Jim is suggesting that they start patrolling the streets at night.

Helene says, “You mean organize a neighborhood watc h?” A “neighborhood” is an area within a city. “To watch,” of course, means  to look at, to see. A “neighborhood watch,” however, is a group of people  in a certain neighborhood that agree to pay attention, if nothing else, to the area in which they live, and if they see anything that looks wrong – that might be illegal or suspicious – they call the police.

A lot of big American cities have organizations cal led “neighborhood watches” that basically try to make everyone in the neighbor hood aware of who lives there and who doesn’t and to report any problems immediat ely to the police. I mentioned that you look for things that are suspici ous, and that’s exactly what Jim is talking about. Jim says, “If you’re worried,  when you see something suspicious, call the police.” “Suspicious” (suspici ous) is something that makes you think that it may be illegal or harmful, even t hough you’re not exactly sure.

Helene says, “And you think they’ll come in time to  catch them?” Helene doubts that the police would arrive in time in order to ar rest or investigate any problems that she reports. Helene says, “The police aren’t k nown for quick response times in this neighborhood.” A “response time” would be t he amount of time needed for someone to react to something, especially when we’r e talking about the time from which you make a request for police or an ambu lance and the time that the police or the ambulance arrives at your house. That  would be the response time.

Jim says, “Then we’ll go after them ourselves.” “To  go after” someone is a phrasal verb meaning to run after or to pursue some one with the idea of catching the person and holding them and perhaps even punish ing them. “To go after,” more generally, can mean to attack. But here, it re ally means to run after a person and try to catch that person. Helene says, “ You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that would be wise.”

Helene doesn’t think it’s wise or a good idea to be come “vigilantes.” A “vigilante” (vigilante) is someone who is not a member of the p olice who tries to catch and punish criminals even though the person doesn’t hav e the legal authority to do that. Jim says, “Why not?” meaning why shouldn’t we  become vigilantes? “If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I.” Clint Eastwood, as s ome of you may remember, starred in some movies where he played a vigilante.  These were movies back in the 1970s. I’m thinking especially of the movie cal led, in English, Dirty Harry .

Jim finishes our dialogue by using one of the expre ssions, the famous lines, from the Clint Eastwood movie: “Go ahead, punk, make my day!” When you say “go ahead,” you are inviting the other person to do som ething, but sometimes you’re saying it when you don’t really want the person to do something but you’re not going to stop the person from doing it if he wants to. The expression “make my day” is used to challenge someone to a fight.

So, if I have a gun, and you want to punch me with your fist, I may say, “Go ahead, make my day,” meaning if you punch me, I wil l, in this case, shoot you with my gun. “Make my day” normally means to make y ou happy, to do something that makes your day better, but obviously  we’re using it here in a somewhat different way. We’re saying that the oppor tunity to punish you would make me happy – and that, of course, is the way a v igilante might feel, since a vigilante is trying to punish criminals even though  he doesn’t have the authority to do so.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jim: Did you hear what happened to the Romeros?

Helene: No, what?

Jim: They went on vacation for a week and vandals b roke a couple of windows in the back of their house and tagged their living roo m walls with graffiti.

Helene: That’s terrible! There are always punks who  like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun, but this is much more serious .

Jim: I think things are getting out of hand. Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slashed or t heir cars keyed.

 Helene: And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds tramp led and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago. This neighborhood is re ally going downhill.

Jim: What should we do about it?

Helene: What do you mean?

Jim: I think we should start patrolling the streets  at night.

Helene: You mean organize a neighborhood watch? Wou ldn’t that be dangerous?

Jim: If you’re worried, when you see something susp icious, call the police.

Helene: And you think they’ll come in time to catch  them? The police aren’t known for quick response times in this neighborhood .

Jim: Then we’ll go after them ourselves.

Helene: You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that w ould be wise.

Jim: Why not? If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I . Go ahead, punk, make my day!

# Adopting a Pet

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,030 – Adopting a Pet.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,030. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue between Rene and Gabe about doing something very st range: adopting a pet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gabe: Why are we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.

Rene: I know that’s what you’d like to do, but I th ought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to adopt a  dog. Look at this cute little dog. This card lists his breed and says that he was negl ected and abandoned. How could you turn down a face like that?

Gabe: I don’t think he’s right for us. Let’s move o n.

Rene: Look at this one. It says on his card that wh en they found him, he showed signs of abuse. Poor baby. How can you not be moved  to take this little guy home?

Gabe: Let’s keep moving.

Rene: How about this little dog? I’d hate to see th is little guy be put down. Here, pet her and look at her little face.

Gabe: This animal shelter isn’t going to put down t hese dogs. It’s a humane place.

Rene: They have no choice. They find so many strays  that there’s no room to keep them. It’s so sad. It’s tragic, really.

Gabe: Maybe . . .

Rene: What did you say?

Gabe: I said maybe we could take one home, maybe tw o.

Rene: Really? Two would be great, but three would b e better.

Gabe: Don’t push your luck!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gabe asking Rene, “Why are  we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.” The phrasal verb  “to put off” here means to delay, to decide to do something later than you had  originally planned. “I’m going to put off buying a new car until next year” – I’m going to buy a new car, but I’m not going to do it right now. I’m going to put it o ff until next year.

There’s a very similar phrasal verb, “to be put off .” “To be put off” is when you are discouraged by something or have a negative reactio n to something in such a way that you decide not to do it. That’s different from this use of “put off,” which means simply to delay – to do something later than you had originally planned. Gabe thought that he and Rene had decided to put of f getting a dog.

Rene says, “I know that’s what you’d like to do, bu t I thought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to a dopt a dog.” Rene is saying that she doesn’t want to put off getting a dog. She says  that’s Gabe’s idea – and a good idea it is, if you ask me. Rene says, “I thoug ht a trip to the pound would convince you that this is the right time to adopt a  dog.” A “pound” here means an animal shelter – a place where animals are kept unt il they can be put in another home, or sometimes until they put them to sleep. “T o put a dog to sleep” means to kill a dog.

So, a dog pound would be a place where lost dogs, f or example, would be taken. The police just don’t walk around and shoot dogs wh o appear to be lost, although that might be a quick way of getting rid of them. I nstead, the dogs are taken to a pound – an “animal shelter,” as it’s also called – until either someone comes and gets the dog or, as I say, until they run out of ro om at the pound, in which case the dogs will eventually be “put to sleep,” as we l ike to say it nicely.

Rene wants to adopt a dog. The verb “to adopt” (ado pt) means to officially make – in this case, the dog – part of your family. We u se the same verb when we’re talking about babies. If you adopt a baby, you make  that baby, or that child, part of your family. We also use that same verb when we’ re talking about an

organization, such as the government, deciding to f ollow some new rule or to establish some new law. We talk about a government “adopting” certain laws. They approve them, and they put them into use.

Rene then says, “Look at this cute little dog. This  card lists his breed and says he was neglected and abandoned.” The “card” is a littl e piece of paper, we’re guessing, that is attached to the dog’s cage, where  they keep the dog. The card lists his “breed” (breed). The “breed” of the dog i s the specific type of dog that it is. We actually use this word for a lot of differen t kinds of animals when we’re talking about a specific kind of, in this case, dog  or cat or horse. We don’t talk about breeds when we’re talking about human beings,  however – at least, not in the same way.

Rene says this particular dog has been “neglected a nd abandoned.” “To neglect” (neglect) means to ignore or not take care of somet hing or someone. So, if the dog has been neglected, the dog has not been taken care of properly – perhaps he’s sick or doesn’t have enough food.

“Abandoned” comes from the verb “to abandon,” which  means to leave something or someone and basically walk away from i t, decide you’re not going to bother with it anymore. You don’t sell it. You d on’t give it to someone. You just leave it somewhere and hope that someone else finds  it and takes it – or not. You may not care. If a dog has been abandoned, the owner of the dog decides he doesn’t want the dog anymore and, I don’t know, puts them in a park and then drives away, I guess.

Rene says, “How could you turn down a face like tha t?” “To turn down” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to say no to something or  to someone. “To reject” or “to deny,” are also possible definitions of this ph rasal verb “to turn down.” “I asked the beautiful girl out on a date and she turn ed me down.” She turned down my invitation. She said no. That used to happen a l ot to me. It doesn’t happen anymore, of course, because I’m married.

Rene is trying to get Gabe, of course, to adopt a c ute-looking dog. Gabe says, “I don’t think he’s right for us, let’s move on” – let ’s keep looking. Gabe doesn’t like this particular dog. Rene then says, “Look at this one. It says on his card that when they found him, he showed signs of abuse.” “Ab use” (abuse) is when someone treats you badly, or in this case, treats a  dog badly. They may hit them. They may hurt them. They may do other things that h arm them emotionally or physically. Notice that the verb is “to abuse” and the noun is “abuse.” The “s” is unvoiced in the noun form, for those of you who are  interested in that sort of thing.

 Rene says, “Poor baby.” “Poor baby” is something yo u might say when you feel sorry for a young child, or in this case, a dog. Yo u might also say it to an adult. “Oh, poor baby” – but when we do that, we are often  being sarcastic. We’re making a joke. Rene says, “How can you not be moved  to take this little guy home?” How can you not be moved to take the dog hom e? “To be moved” to do something means to feel a very strong emotion that makes you want to act or behave in a certain way. In this case, Rene is trying to get Gabe to bring the dog – “the little guy,” as she calls him – home.

Gabe again says, “Let’s keep moving.” Rene then say s, “How about this little dog? I’d hate to see this little guy be put down.” “To put down” an animal means the same as to put an animal to sleep. It means to kill the animal. Once again, Rene refers to the animal by saying “this little gu y.” “Guy” is normally a word we use for human beings, and perhaps that’s why Rene u ses it here. She’s trying to get Gabe to feel sorry for this dog.

She then says, “Here, pet her and look at her littl e face.” Now she talks about her as a “her.” The word “guy” is usually used to refer  to a boy or a man, unless it’s plural. If you say “guys,” you could be referring t o a group of men or boys, or a group of both men and women, or boys and girls.

But in any case, Rene is inviting Gabe to pet the d og. “To pet” (pet), as a verb, means to gently touch the dog with your hand, usual ly on the top. That’s “petting.” Notice that as a noun, the word “pet” (p et) refers to an actual animal that you keep usually in your house, like a dog and  a cat. Here it’s used as a verb, and it means to caress or to gently touch an animal with your hand, usually touching its “fur” (fur), which is its hair.

Gabe says, “This animal shelter isn’t going to put down these dogs.” He’s saying that the pound – the animal shelter – will not kill  the dogs. “It’s a humane place.” The word “humane” (humane) means not harming other people, or in this case, dogs. The word obviously comes from the word “human ,” but we use it in talking not just about humans and being nice to humans, bei ng kind to humans, but also when talking about animals. In fact, there is somet hing called, I think, the Humane Society. This is a group of people who are n ot interested in humans, but interested in animals and making sure people are no t cruel or mean to animals. People like me.

Rene says, “They have no choice,” meaning the anima l shelter will not have a choice about putting the dogs down. “They find so m any strays that there is no

room to keep them.” A “stray” (stray), as a noun, i s an animal like a dog or a cat that has been abandoned and doesn’t have a place to  stay or a place to live.

Rene says, “It’s so sad. It’s tragic, really.” The word “tragic” (tragic) means very sad, something that is very “distressful,” we might  say. Once again, Rene is trying to convince Gabe that they should adopt a do g. Gabe says, “Maybe.” Rene says, “What did you say?” Gabe replies, “I said may be we could take one home, maybe two.” So, he’s saying it’s possible for us to  adopt one or even two dogs.

Rene says, “Really?” She’s very surprised. “Two wou ld be great, but three would be better.” Rene is saying that adopting two dogs w ould be wonderful, but what would be even better, what would be even more wonde rful, is if they adopted three dogs. Remember, Gabe didn’t even want to adop t one dog when the dialogue began. Gabe says to Rene, “Don’t push your  luck.” “To push (push) your luck” means to try very hard to make something  happen after you’ve already achieved something good. It means to take things to o far.

So, when your son or daughter asks to use the car, perhaps because they don’t own their own car, you say, “Okay, you can use it, but you have to return it by ten o’clock tonight.” Your son or daughter might say, “ Oh, can I stay out until midnight?” Can I return it at midnight? You might s ay to them, “Don’t push your luck,” meaning you’ve already been lucky. You’ve al ready gotten something you want. Don’t try to get more than that because you m ight lose both things. You might have the favor that was granted, or given you , taken away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gabe: Why are we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.

Rene: I know that’s what you’d like to do, but I th ought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to adopt a  dog. Look at this cute little dog. This card lists his breed and says that he was negl ected and abandoned. How could you turn down a face like that?

Gabe: I don’t think he’s right for us. Let’s move o n.

Rene: Look at this one. It says on his card that wh en they found him, he showed signs of abuse. Poor baby. How can you not be moved  to take this little guy home?

This episode is a dialogue between Danny and Carol about what’s called a “court case,” a legal action involving a judge and lawyers . Sounds like fun. Sounds expensive. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danny: Have you been following the Schirru case?

Carol: Yeah, I have. I think he’s guilty.

Danny: You’re kidding, right? He’s innocent and thi s is a show trial. The district attorney is conducting a witch-hunt for his own pol itical ambitions.

Carol: No, he’s not. It is a high-profile case, but  that’s only because he wants to make an example of Schirru. People like him should be off the streets. Putting him in jail sends a message to other criminals.

Danny: What kind of message?

Carol: The message that the government is cracking down.

Danny: I think it’s just grandstanding and Schirru is being made a sacrificial lamb.

Carol: You can believe what you like, but I think i t’s great that the district attorney is taking a stand.

Danny: Yes, but he seems to be doing it at the expe nse of real justice.

 Carol: Not from where I’m standing.

Danny: Then you need to find a new place to stand –  preferably one without blind spots.

[end of dialogue]

Danny begins our dialogue by saying to Carol, “Have  you been following the Schirru case?” Carol says, “Yeah, I have. I think h e’s guilty.” If you say someone is “guilty” (guilty), you’re saying that they have done something wrong – that they have broken the law or perhaps broken some rule. Da nny says, “You’re kidding, right?” meaning you’re joking. You’re not really se rious.

“He’s innocent and this is a show trial.” To say so meone is “innocent” (innocent) is to say that the person is not guilty, did not do  the crime, did not break the law. So, “guilty” and “innocent” are the two possibiliti es if someone is arrested by the police and taken in front of the judge. The “judge, ” of course, is the person, man or woman, who either decides someone is guilty or i nnocent, or more commonly runs the actual legal proceedings – runs what we wo uld call the “trial.”

A “trial” (trial) is the actual event which involve s the lawyers from the government and the lawyers from the defense getting together a nd arguing their case in front of a judge and typically in front of what’s called the “jury” (jury). A jury consists of six or, more commonly, 12 people who decide if a pe rson is guilty or innocent of some criminal action.

Danny says that this is a “show trial.” A “show tri al” would be one that is basically political. The government has already decided that this person is guilty and will be punished, but they have a trial just so it looks  like they’re being fair. We usually associate this particular term with, for ex ample, the show trials in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin in the former Soviet Unio n. But of course, the term could be used for any case in which the government has already made a decision, but wants people to think that the person  is getting justice according to a fair legal proceeding.

Danny says, “The district attorney is conducting a witch-hunt for his own political ambitions.” In the United States, the district atto rney is the government’s lawyer, usually the most important or the chief lawyer in a ny given area. The United States is broken up into different districts. In th ese districts, these regions or areas each have their own district attorney, and the district attorney is the

government person, the government official, in char ge of deciding who is going to get a trial and who isn’t.

The district attorney in the United States’ legal s ystem has a lot of power to do a lot of different things, including deciding if some one is going to, we would use the expression, “stand trial,” meaning whether the pers on was going to have to go in front of a judge and a jury and defend himself. So,  district attorneys are government attorneys who are responsible for repres enting the government in, in this case, a criminal trial.

Danny says that this trial is being conducted by a district attorney who’s on “a witch-hunt.” A “witch” (witch) is supposedly a woma n who has magical powers. Someone who is “on a hunt” (hunt) is looking for so mething, often something to kill or something to catch, such as an animal. We t alk about hunting deer or hunting cats. No, we don’t hunt cats, just kidding.  The term “witch-hunt,” however, refers to the practice of looking for peop le to punish, not because they’ve done anything wrong, but because they are of a different opinion or act in a different way than you do.

The idea of a witch-hunt goes back, at least in the  U.S., to the famous Salem witch trials, where several women were accused or w ere said to have been witches and were eventually arrested, and some of t hem killed. Nowadays, when someone talks about a witch-hunt, they’re usually t alking about someone, especially the government, trying to find people wh o are guilty, even though they’re not really guilty.

A witch-hunt also has this notion of being politica lly motivated – that it is being done not for criminal reasons, if you will, but for  political reasons. It’s not about a crime. It’s about politics and using criminal law, in this case, to promote a political position. Danny says the district attorney is doing  this trial, conducting this witch- hunt, “for his own political ambitions.” Your “poli tical ambitions” would be the things that you hope to accomplish in the world of politics. “Political ambition” refers to your desire to have a powerful career in politics.

Carol says, “No, he’s not,” meaning “No, the distri ct attorney is not conducting a witch-hunt.” She says, “It’s a high-profile case.” The term “high-profile” (profile) means that it is getting a lot of attention. A lot of people are paying attention to it. It is in the news. It is in the newspaper. That wou ld be something that is high- profile. A high-profile case would be a legal trial , a criminal trial, that a lot of people are paying attention to.

Carol says, “It’s a high-profile case, but that’s o nly because he,” meaning the district attorney, “wants to make an example of Sch irru.” “To make an example of” someone is to make someone serve as a warning t o other people. You may punish someone not necessarily because they’ve done  something terribly wrong, but because you want other people to take this as a  lesson – to see this as something that might happen to them if they’re not careful. So, making an example of someone is punishing one person to show the other people what will happen to them if they break the same rule or break  the same law.

Carol says, “People like him,” now referring to Sch irru, “should be off the streets,” meaning they should not be free. They should be in prison. “Putting him in jail” – in prison – “sends a message to other criminals,” s he says. A “criminal” (criminal) is a person who has committed or done a crime, some thing against the law. Danny says, “What kind of message?”

Carol responds, “The message that the government is  cracking down.” The phrasal verb “to crack (crack) down” is used when s omeone in authority, such as the government, decides to enforce the rules more s trictly, decides that it is no longer going to let people break this law. So, if t he police crack down on speeding in Los Angeles, they will start arresting more people. They will start giving more people penalties – “fines,” we would ca ll them – if they drive too fast.

Danny says, “I think it’s just grandstanding.” “To grandstand” (grandstand) means to behave or to speak in a way that attracts attent ion, that other people pay attention to, in order to make yourself feel more i mportant or more powerful. That’s what Danny says the district attorney is doi ng here.

Danny says, “Schirru is being made a sacrificial la mb.” A “sacrificial (sacrificial) lamb (lamb)” is a person who is put into a damaging  position or harmed for the benefit of everyone else. A sacrificial lamb would be someone who is punished in order that everybody else is better off – in order to benefit other people.

Carol says, “You can believe what you like, but I t hink it’s great that the district attorney is taking a stand.” “To take a stand” (sta nd) is to tell people what your position is, what your opinion is, and not change i t, not try to be persuaded by others. “To take a stand” is to decide that you are  going to defend your position even if other people disagree with you.

Danny says, “Yes, but he” – the district attorney –  “seems to be doing it at the expense of real justice.” If you do something “at t he expense (expense) of” something else, you are causing harm to one thing i n order to help another thing. Danny is saying that the district attorney is takin g a stand, is giving his opinion,

but at the expense of real justice. “Justice” (just ice) here refers to fairness in the way people are treated, especially when we’re talki ng about the laws of a country or a place.

Carol says, “Not from where I’m standing.” This exp ression “from where I’m standing” is used to talk about your point of view,  your perspective, your opinion about something. If someone says, “From where I’m s tanding, it sounds like a terrible idea,” the person is saying, “In my opinio n,” from my perspective, “this is a bad idea.” Danny says, “Then you need to find a n ew place to stand, preferably one without blind spots.”

Danny is making sort of a joke here. He’s saying th at Carol needs to have a new perspective, a new view of things, one that doesn’t  have any “blind (blind) spots.” “Blind spots” are areas that you can’t see or that you can’t see clearly, often because there is something in your way preventing y ou from seeing it clearly. Here it’s used really to refer to someone who perha ps has certain biases or prejudices, and those biases don’t allow the person  to see something accurately or fairly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Danny: Have you been following the Schirru case?

Carol: Yeah, I have. I think he’s guilty.

Danny: You’re kidding, right? He’s innocent and thi s is a show trial. The district attorney is conducting a witch-hunt for his own pol itical ambitions.

Carol: No, he’s not. It is a high-profile case, but  that’s only because he wants to make an example of Schirru. People like him should be off the streets. Putting him in jail sends a message to other criminals.

Danny: What kind of message?

Carol: The message that the government is cracking down.

Danny: I think it’s just grandstanding and Schirru is being made a sacrificial lamb.

Carol: You can believe what you like, but I think i t’s great that the district attorney is taking a stand.

 Danny: Yes, but he seems to be doing it at the expe nse of real justice.

Carol: Not from where I’m standing.

Danny: Then you need to find a new place to stand –  preferably one without blind spots.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Bianca and Conrad about management styles – the way people handle, or  manage, other people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca: Today’s the day. We’re supposed to find out  who the new manager is going to be. I hope they’re not making a mistake by  hiring internally.

Conrad: I just hope they don’t pick Melissa. She wo uld be a disaster.

Bianca: Why do you say that? I like Melissa.

Conrad: I like her, too, but she can be so autocrat ic. Give her a little power and it goes to her head. Every decision would be top-down.

Bianca: You might be right, but I think Quentin wou ld be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not having a ma nager at all. He’d delegate everything and then sit back and do nothing.

Conrad: I’ll grant you that. Quentin would be a hor rible manager. What about Jemima? She’s popular with nearly everybody in the office.

Bianca: I suppose Jemima would be a bearable option . She likes to collaborate and often consults with other people to get their f eedback. But I’m backing a different horse, one that would be the ideal.

Conrad: Who?

Bianca: You.

Conrad: Me? No way. I don’t have a chance in hell. And plus, how do you know I’d be a good manager?

Bianca: You’d be democratic in your decision making  and I’d like that. You wouldn’t rule with an iron fist.

Conrad: That’s what you think. Give me a little pow er and you can start calling me commandant.

[end of dialogue]

Bianca begins our dialogue by saying to Conrad, “To day’s the day.” This is a common expression in English which means simply tha t something important is going to happen today or something I’m about to tel l you is going to take place today. Bianca tells us what is going to happen toda y in the dialogue. She says, “We’re supposed to find out who the new manager is going to be.”

A “manager” is a person who is responsible for cont rolling or handling or taking care of other people, usually related to some proje ct for your work. We might also use the word “supervisor.” A supervisor is a manage r who takes care of other people, who is in charge of other people, usually i n a work environment.

Bianca says, “I hope they’re” – meaning the company  – “not making a mistake by hiring internally.” “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job. Sometimes you’ll walk into a grocery store or a restaurant, and ther e will be a sign on the window that says “Now hiring.” That means they’re looking for people for jobs that they have available.

“To hire internally” (internally) means to hire som eone for a job from within your organization, from within your company. When you hi re internally, you don’t bring someone new to the company. You take someone who’s already working at the company and you give him or her this job. That’s of ten the case in large organizations where there are a lot of employees wh o already understand what the company does and the way it works. So, it’s eas ier to put one of them in charge as a manager.

Conrad says, “I just hope they don’t pick Melissa.”  “To pick” here means to select – to hire, in this case. Melissa, according to Conr ad, “would be a disaster.” She would be a terrible manager is what he means. Bianc a says, “Why do you say that? I like Melissa.” Conrad says, “I like her too , but she can be so autocratic.”

“To be autocratic” (autocratic) means to be someone  who has a lot of power and uses that power very “controllingly,” we might say – someone who is very strict with his or her employees, who’s always telling peo ple what to do, who is always using his or her power to control other people.

Conrad says, “Give her a little power and it goes t o her head.” The expression “to go to one’s head” means something makes one feel ve ry proud, very important, and usually superior to other people. In other word s, you think you are better than other people because you were given this power , and suddenly you start to use this power – you start to think that you are mo re important than you really are. Conrad then says, “Every decision would be top -down.” The term “top-down” refers to a system of decision making in an organiz ation where everything is decided by the people at the top of the organizatio n – that is, the leaders.

Now of course, generally speaking, the leaders of a ny organization or company are the ones who make the big decisions, but if you  describe a company or an organization as having a very top-down management s tyle, you mean that almost everything gets decided by the leaders. The people who work at the company don’t have very much power. They don’t have a lot of influence on the decisions that are made. The opposite of “top-down” would be “bottom-up.” “Bottom-up” would be where people who are at the bottom of the company – the lowest employees, if you will – have some power and some i nfluence on decisions that are made.

Bianca says, “You might be right, but I think Quent in would be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not havin g a manager at all.” The term “laissez-faire” (laissez-faire) means hands-off – s omeone who lets things go and doesn’t interfere, someone who doesn’t try to contr ol or direct the situation. The term is often used in the world of economics to tal k about an economic policy where the government doesn’t interfere with busines s or only interferes very minimally, not very much at all.

If we describe someone’s management style as “laiss ez-faire,” we mean that this person just lets things happen, doesn’t try to cont rol things or interfere with things. That’s why Bianca says “it would be like no t having a manager at all.” It would be as if there were no one in charge, no one serving or acting as a manager.

Bianca says, “He’d” – meaning Quentin – “delegate e verything and then sit back and do nothing.” “To delegate” (delegate) means to give other people things to do, to assign tasks to someone else, particularly t hings that are part of a larger project. If you are working on a large project, you  can’t possibly do everything

yourself. If you are the manager, you have to give other people things to do. You have to assign them things to do. That is what the verb “to delegate” means.

Conrad says, “I’ll grant you that.” That expression , “I’ll grant (grant) you that,” is used to express agreement with what another person has said – to indicate that the other person has made a good point, has said so mething that you agree with and that is correct. We use that expression when we  are having a disagreement with someone, but there’s something the other perso n said that we do want to agree with. So, we are using this expression to say , “Yes, on that specific thing, I agree with you.”

Conrad says, “Quentin would be a horrible manager. What about Jemima?” “She’s popular with nearly everybody in the office, ” Conrad says. Bianca says, “I suppose Jemima would be a bearable option.” When we  say something is “bearable” (bearable) we mean it would not be too d ifficult. It would not be too awful, but it wouldn’t be very good, either.

Bianca says that Jemima “likes to collaborate and o ften consults with other people to get their feedback.” “To collaborate” mea ns to work with other people in order to get something done. “To consult” (consult)  means to ask other people’s opinions, to get other people to tell you what they  think. “To get feedback” (feedback) is to get the opinions and reactions fro m other people. It’s similar to “consult.” “Consult,” however, has some other meani ngs in English which we won’t talk about here, but here it simply means to ask other people for their opinion. Bianca is saying that Jemima is the kind of person that would collaborate, consult, and get people’s feedback.

She says, however, “I’m backing a different horse, one that would be ideal.” “To back (back) a different horse” is an expression tha t means to support a different person or a different idea – to hope that someone e lse wins or something else is adopted or is successful. The verb “to back” means to support, usually by giving money to someone or doing something to help that pe rson win. We can talk about people who invest in a new company “backing” the company. They are supporting the company by giving the company money.

Conrad asks who Bianca is backing. Bianca says, “Yo u,” meaning Conrad. Conrad says, “Me? No way.” “No way” is an informal way of saying “absolutely not.” “I don’t have a chance in hell.” The expressi on “to not have a chance in hell” means that something is simply not going to happen.  It’s going to be nearly impossible or at least extremely unlikely that this  will happen. I’m guessing the expression comes from a longer phrase, which is “a snowball’s chance in hell.”

A “snowball” is made of cold snow and ice. “Hell” i s traditionally thought of as being the place that is very hot. So, if you put a cold thing into someplace that is very hot, it probably won’t survive. In this case, the snowball will melt. Hence, we have this expression, “a snowball’s chance in hell, ” meaning not very likely. If you see a beautiful woman, your friend may say to you, “You don’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of getting her telephone number.” Th at would be an example.

Conrad says, “How do you know I’d be a good manager ?” He’s asking Bianca why Bianca wants him to be a manager. Bianca says, “You’d be democratic in your decision making, and I’d like that.” “To be de mocratic” here means that a person would allow other people on the project to v ote or to give their opinions and have their opinions matter. Bianca says, “You w ouldn’t rule with an iron fist.” The expression “to rule with an iron (iron) fist (f ist)” means something similar to autocratic. It means to be very strict, very contro lling.

Conrad says, “That’s what you think.” The expressio n “that’s what you think” is used to mean you have the wrong idea. You may think  that, but it’s not true. Conrad says, “That’s what you think. Give me a litt le power, and you can start calling me commandant.” “Commandant” (commandant) i s a senior military leader. The idea here is that Conrad would be like someone in the military, giving orders and not asking for anyone’s opinion. Certain ly, the military is not normally known to be very democratic.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca: Today’s the day. We’re supposed to find out  who the new manager is going to be. I hope they’re not making a mistake by  hiring internally.

Conrad: I just hope they don’t pick Melissa. She wo uld be a disaster.

Bianca: Why do you say that? I like Melissa.

Conrad: I like her, too, but she can be so autocrat ic. Give her a little power and it goes to her head. Every decision would be top-down.

Bianca: You might be right, but I think Quentin wou ld be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not having a ma nager at all. He’d delegate everything and then sit back and do nothing.

This episode is a dialogue between Yolanda and Bob about winning and losing, victory or loss. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yolanda: Did you see the game last night?

Bob: You mean the crushing victory of my team over yours?

Yolanda: That’s not how I would characterize it. We  fell short in the final seconds, but we played a good game up until then.

Bob: In your dreams. My team dominated from beginni ng to end. You’re just lucky that it wasn’t a complete blowout.

Yolanda: We would have won if the coach hadn’t deci ded to throw in the towel early. I think he just melted down under the pressu re.

Bob: It’s easy for you to play Monday morning quart erback, but I don’t think anything would have saved your team from going down  in flames.

Yolanda: There’s a rematch in three weeks, you know .

Bob: And my team will whup your team again, no ques tion.

Yolanda: You can trash talk all you like. We’ll see  if you’re still smiling after my team wipes the floor with yours!

[end of dialogue]

 Our dialogue begins with Yolanda asking Bob, “Did y ou see the game last night?” Some sort of sports game, we guess. Bob says, “You mean the crushing victory of my team over yours?” A “victory” (victory) is a win, when you beat another person in some competition or race. The word “crush ing” (crushing) means very difficult to deal with. We usually talk about a “cr ushing defeat” (defeat).

A crushing defeat would be a case where you lose, b ut you lose very badly and it’s very difficult for you to deal with it. You are having a lot of problems understanding it. You perhaps even lose hope that y ou will be able to do better in the future. Anything that is crushing is difficult to deal with. Bob uses the term to describe the victory of his favorite team over Yola nda’s favorite team. So, he’s really saying that the victory was very convincing – that they really beat the other team badly, we might say.

Yolanda says, “That’s not how I would characterize it.” “To characterize” (characterize) is to describe something, to select certain words to talk about something. Yolanda is saying that she would not cha racterize – she would not describe – the game last night as being one of a “c rushing victory” for Bob’s team. She says, “We,” meaning her team, “fell short  in the final seconds, but we played a good game up until then.”

“To fall short” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning not to do as well as you had hoped or had expected – not to meet expectations, w e might say. “I need a hundred dollars, but I was only able to get ninety. ” I fell short of my goal. I didn’t do as well as I thought I would. Yolanda says that her team “played a good game” – they were playing well – “up until then,” m eaning the end of the game. “Up until” means leading up to that point before th is point.

Bob says, “In your dreams.” This is a somewhat insu lting thing to say to someone. “In your dreams” is a phrase used to show that you don’t believe what the other person has just said. You’re saying that the other person’s belief or opinion is not realistic. It’s not true. It’s not e ven close, perhaps. Bob says, “My team dominated from beginning to end.” “To dominate ” (dominate) means to control someone or something, to have complete powe r over another person or another thing or a situation – in this case, a game .

Bob says his team dominated from the beginning of t he game to the end of the game. He says, “You’re just lucky that it wasn’t a complete blowout.” A “blowout” (blowout) is a very easy win or victory for a team.  If you’re playing, I don’t know, soccer, and your team wins 25 to nothing, that woul d definitely be a blowout. In other words, it was a very easy, easy victory. I’m not the world’s biggest soccer

fan, but I think if I saw that score, I would descr ibe the game as a complete blowout.

Yolanda says, “We would have won if the coach” – the leader of the team – “hadn’t decided to throw in the towel early.” The e xpression “to throw in the towel” means to give up, to no longer try to do som ething because it’s too difficult or too challenging or perhaps impossible. “To throw  in the towel” means to say, “Okay, I lose. I don’t want to continue playing any more,” basically. That’s what Yolanda thinks the coach of her team did early, or at least too early, in the game.

Yolanda says, “I think he just melted down under pr essure.” The verb “to melt” (melt) means for something to go from a solid state  to a liquid state. So if you have a ball of ice and you put it in the oven, it w ill melt. The ice, a solid, will turn into water, a liquid. “To melt down” means to take something that is solid and convert it into liquid. You might talk about, for e xample, melting down your gold wedding ring in order to sell it and make money. Yo u shouldn’t do that, however, unless perhaps you’re no longer married or you real ly need the money.

When we describe a person as “melting down,” we mea n that this person was not able to perform because of the stress, because of the pressure of the situation. Someone who “melts down under pressure” is someone who in a difficult situation is not able to perform the way he or she would normally perform without that stress.

Bob says, “It’s easy for you to play Monday morning  quarterback, but I don’t think anything would have saved your team from going down  in flames.” The expression “Monday morning quarterback” is popular in American English. It refers to American football. The “quarterback” on a  football team, an American football team, is the person who is sort of the lea der of the team, the person who gets the ball first and either gives it to someone or throws it to someone. The quarterback is often making the important decisions  in terms of what the next play is going to be in the game.

Now, you have to understand that in the U.S., profe ssional football teams almost always play on Sunday afternoon. Monday is the day after Sunday (you probably knew that already). If you are “playing Monday morn ing quarterback,” you are making decisions after the fact. You are criticizin g someone else, saying that you could’ve done it better – even though, of course, y ou probably couldn’t have done it better.

It’s often used when someone takes information from  a situation that the person who is making the decision didn’t have and saying, “Oh, well, I would’ve done

something differently.” During the football season,  people often talk about the game on Monday morning during their coffee break or  perhaps before work. If you criticize your team after the game is over, you ’re playing Monday morning quarterback. You are saying you could have done a b etter job, which usually is not the case.

Bob says that he doesn’t think anything would have saved Yolanda’s team from “going down in flames.” The phrasal verb “to go dow n” here means to lose, to be defeated. “Flames” (flames) refers to fire. “To go down in flames” refers probably originally to a plane, for example, crashing to the  ground. What will happen if a plane hits the ground, if it crashes? It will proba bly go up in flames. It will explode. The gasoline will catch fire. “To go down in flames” means to fail very badly and often very quickly.

Yolanda says, “There is a rematch in three weeks, y ou know.” A “rematch” is another game between the same two teams. So if you play against one team and you lose, you say, “Well, we’ll have a rematch thre e weeks from now,” or “We’ll have a rematch next week.” We will play again. The same two teams will play again. Bob says, however, “And my team will whup yo ur team again, no question.” “To whup” (whup) is an informal verb mea ning to defeat another person or another team very badly – to have a very clear victory.

Yolanda says, “You can trash talk all you like. We’ ll see if you’re still smiling after my team wipes the floor with yours.” The phrasal ve rb “to trash (trash) talk” is used when you are playing sports, for example, and you are telling the other team how bad they are, how horrible they are, how t hey’re terrible players. If you say, “Oh, your team is going to lose so badly, you’ re going to wish you hadn’t even decided to play us.” “To trash talk” is to ins ult the other team.

You could also trash talk about one person that you  are playing. If you are playing a game against another person, you could sa y, “Oh, you’re terrible, you’re never going to win.” You say insulting thing s about that person to make yourself seem better perhaps than you really are. T he expression “to wipe the floor with” means to defeat another person very bad ly. Once again, to have a very clear win. Yolanda is talking about her team w iping the floor with Bob’s team. She means that her team is going to defeat Bo b’s team and defeat them very decisively, by a big score.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yolanda: Did you see the game last night?

Bob: You mean the crushing victory of my team over yours?

Yolanda: That’s not how I would characterize it. We  fell short in the final seconds, but we played a good game up until then.

Bob: In your dreams. My team dominated from beginni ng to end. You’re just lucky that it wasn’t a complete blowout.

Yolanda: We would have won if the coach hadn’t deci ded to throw in the towel early. I think he just melted down under the pressu re.

Bob: And my team will whup your team again, no ques tion.

Yolanda: You can trash talk all you like. We’ll see  if you’re still smiling after my team wipes the floor with yours!

I’m pretty sure our scriptwriter could whup me in a lmost any game we played. That’s because she’s so smart. She’s the wonderful,  creative Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.



# Making Changes to a Hotel Reservation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,034 – Making Changes to a Hotel Reservation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,034. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Sally and a pers on who works for a hotel, and it’s about making a hotel reservation. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Reservation agent: Hello, Milton Hotel reservations . How may I assist you?

Sally: Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an e xisting reservation.

Reservation agent: Certainly. Do you have the reser vation number?

Sally: Sure, it’s 234678.

Reservation agent: That’s a reservation for Sally M enkel. Is that right?

Sally: Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the ch eck-in date from September 15th to September 16th.

Reservation agent: Certainly. I can make that chang e for you. Is that the only change?

Sally: No, the check-out date will also change, fro m the 23rd to the 24th.

Reservation agent: No problem. We have you arriving  on the 16th of September and departing the 24th of September. Will there be anything else?

Sally: Yes, there will be two people in my party, n ot just one.

Reservation agent: I’ve made that change. Anything else I can help you with?

 Sally: Yes, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a  room with a view, preferably on an upper floor.

Reservation agent: I can certainly change that for you, although there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $189 per n ight.

Sally: On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that o verlooks the pool. Is that possible?

Reservation agent: Certainly. The new rate is $249 per night.

Sally: Oh, that’s really expensive. I think I’d bet ter to stick to my original room.

Reservation agent: All right. I’ve changed your res ervation back to a courtyard room. Anything else?

Sally: Maybe I should shorten my stay. If I do that , I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates and the rooms again.

Reservation agent: Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one. That way, we can make sure ev erything is correct.

Sally: Oh, that’s not too much trouble for you, is it? I’d hate to be a bother.

Reservation agent: No, no trouble at all.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the “reservation agent” – the employee at the hotel who is in charge of taking reservations – answering the  phone by saying, “Hello, Milton Hotel reservations. How may I assist you?” “ Reservations” refer to calling up a hotel, or perhaps a restaurant, and telling the business that you want to reserve – you want for them to save for you – a roo m if it’s a hotel, or a table for dinner if it’s a restaurant.

“Reservations,” plural, is sometimes also used to d escribe the department or the office that is in charge of taking reservations, es pecially for a hotel or perhaps a rental car company. The reservation agent or employ ee says, “How may I assist you?” “To assist” means the same as “to help.” Sall y says, “Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an existing reservation.” Sall y already has a reservation;

that’s why she refers to it as an “existing (existi ng) reservation” – one that is already in place.

The agent says, “Certainly. Do you have the reserva tion number?” Many businesses that take reservations give people a num ber that is used to help the business find that specific reservation in the futu re – in their computer system, for example. Sally says, “Sure, it’s 234678.” The reser vation agent says, after looking it up on his computer, “That’s a reservatio n for Sally Menkel. Is that right?” Is that correct?

Sally says, “Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the check-in date from September 15th to September 16th.” The “check-in date” is the  date when you arrive at the hotel. It’s the first night that you are going to s pend sleeping at the hotel. The opposite of a “check-in” would be a “check-out.” the “check-out date” is the date that you are leaving the hotel. Sally is changing her check-in date.

The reservation agent says, “Certainly, I can make that change for you. Is that the only change?” Sally says, “No. The checkout dat e will also change, from the 23rd to the 24th – September 24th, of course, being  perhaps the most important day of the year. The reservation agent then says, “ No problem,” which is an informal but very common way of saying “of course” or “yes,” especially when someone asks you to do something or thanks you for doing something. Often people will say, “Hey, thanks for that.” The other person will say, “No problem – it was nothing.”

The reservation agent asks if there are any other c hanges. Sally says, “Yes, there will be two people in my party,” noted one. T he word “party” (party) here doesn’t mean a celebration like a birthday party. I t refers to a group of people, usually people who are using some service at the sa me time. When you go to a nice restaurant, they may ask you how many are in y our party – that is, how many people are going to be sitting with you.

There was a TV show, actually – oh, I don’t know, b ack in the 1980s, 90s – called “Party of Five.” The “party” there refer to the number of people in the group. Now actually, I told this story before, but it’s been awhile, so I’ll tell it again.

The star of that television show “Party of Five” wa s a woman by the name of Neve Campbell. So, one day I’m in a Starbucks waiti ng to order my coffee near one of the big movie studios here in Los Angeles, a nd there’s a woman in front of me who I don’t recognize because I don’t watch very  much television, but a little

girl comes up to the woman and asked the woman for her autograph, for her signature. This is something you often do with famo us people. You ask them for their autograph so you can keep it and say, “See, I  met this famous person.”

So anyway, the little girl didn’t have a pen, and N eve Campbell (I later learned that was her name) said to the girl, “Oh, I don’t h ave a pen, sorry.” I, of course, being a nice guy, took a pen out of my pocket and g ave it to Neve, and Neve signed her autograph – I don’t know, it was probabl y on a small piece of paper – for the young girl. I only learned later who she re ally was.

Now here’s the problem. She kept my pen. Imagine! S he makes all of this money as a big Hollywood star and she steals my pen! So, Neve Campbell, if you are listening to this, bring back my pen.

Okay, back to the dialogue. Sally tells the reserva tion agent that there will be two people in her party. The reservation agent then say s, “I’ve made the change. Anything else I can help you with?” Sally says, “Ye s, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a room with a view, preferably on an upper  floor.”

A “courtyard” (courtyard) – one word – is an open a rea that is surrounded by the walls of the building. Often in a courtyard you’ll have plants or trees and places for people to sit. This design for buildings is not  that common in the United States. It’s much more common in other countries, p articularly in Europe, but there are buildings that have courtyards, and that’ s what this hotel has.

It has a courtyard, and Sally wants something that is not a courtyard room. Instead, she wants “a room with a view.” A “view” ( view) here means something pretty or interesting to look at. If you go to a ho tel in Paris and you can see the Eiffel tower from your room, that would definitely be a room with a good view – or at least, a view of the Eiffel tower, if that’s wha t you really want to see.

So, Sally is asking for a room with a view. Of cour se, not all hotels have very interesting views. The views are only as interestin g as the place where the hotel is located, but Sally wants “a room with a view, pr eferably on an upper floor.” “Preferably” means that would be her first choice. An “upper floor” would be one of the higher levels, or higher floors, of the hote l – not on the first floor which, remember, in the United States is the same as the “ ground floor,” the first floor that you come into as you walk into the hotel.

Sally doesn’t want a room down there. She wants a r oom up high, on an upper floor. The agent says, “I can certainly change that  for you, although there will be a change in the room rate.” The “room rate” (rate) is the price of the room. We

often use that word when we’re talking about the pr ice of renting something for a certain amount of time. If you say, “I got a good r ate on my rental car,” you mean you got a good price, a low price. The agent tells Sally that the new room rate will be a $189 dollars per night.

Sally then says, “On second thought, I’d prefer a s uite that overlooks the pool. Is that possible?” “On second thought” is a common phr ase used when you change your mind and you want to let the other person know  that you’ve changed your mind. If you say to your wife, “I’d like to go to t he movies. No, wait. On second thought, let’s go to the beach instead,” you’re cha nging your mind and then telling the other person that you changed your mind .

Sally says, “On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that overlooks the pool.” A “suite” (suite) is a group of connected rooms in a hotel, usually a very large room with a bedroom and perhaps a kitchen or even other rooms. Hotel suites are obviously more expensive than a single hotel room.

Sally wants a room “that overlooks the pool.” “To o verlook” means to offer a view of something, usually above it. When you use this v erb “to overlook,” you’re normally talking about someplace that is high up, h igh above the ground, above whatever it is that it overlooks. If you are overlo oking the pool (meaning the swimming pool), your room is above the swimming poo l in the building and you can see the swimming pool from your room, from your  room’s window.

The reservation agent says, “Certainly. The new rat e is $249 per night.” A “suite,” again, is more expensive. Sally says, “Oh, that’s r eally expensive. I think I’d better stick to my original room.” “To stick to” so mething means to decide not to change your plans – to go with your original idea, your original plan. The agent says, “All right, I’ve changed your reservation bac k to a courtyard room. Anything else?”

Sally says, “Maybe I should shorten my stay.” She’s  suggesting that perhaps she won’t stay as many days as she had originally plann ed. She says, “If I do that I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates a nd the rooms again.” The agent says, “Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one.” “To cancel” (cancel) means to decide that  you’re not going to continue doing something, or that some event that was suppos ed to take place will not take place. The agent suggests canceling the reserv ation completely and starting a whole new one.

Sally says, “Oh, that’s not too much trouble for yo u, is it? I’d hate to be a bother” (bother). When you say that you “hate to be a bothe r,” you mean that you don’t

 want to cause difficulties for the other person. Yo u don’t want to cause problems for the other person. “I don’t want to be a bother. ”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed

[start of dialogue]

Reservation agent: Hello, Milton Hotel reservations . How may I assist you?

Sally: Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an e xisting reservation.

Reservation agent: Certainly. Do you have the reser vation number?

Sally: Sure, it’s 234678.

Reservation agent: That’s a reservation for Sally M enkel. Is that right?

Sally: Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the ch eck-in date from September 15th to September 16th.

Reservation agent: Certainly. I can make that chang e for you. Is that the only change?

Sally: No, the check-out date will also change, fro m the 23rd to the 24th.

Reservation agent: No problem. We have you arriving  on the 16th of September and departing the 24th of September. Will there be anything else?

Sally: Yes, there will be two people in my party, n ot just one.

Reservation agent: I’ve made that change. Anything else I can help you with?

Sally: Yes, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a  room with a view, preferably on an upper floor.

Reservation agent: I can certainly change that for you, although there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $189 per n ight.

Sally: On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that o verlooks the pool. Is that possible?

Reservation agent: Certainly. The new rate is $249 per night.

 Sally: Oh, that’s really expensive. I think I’d bet ter to stick to my original room.

Reservation agent: All right. I’ve changed your res ervation back to a courtyard room. Anything else?

Sally: Maybe I should shorten my stay. If I do that , I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates and the rooms again.

Reservation agent: Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one. That way, we can make sure ev erything is correct.

Sally: Oh, that’s not too much trouble for you, is it? I’d hate to be a bother.

Reservation agent: No, no trouble at all.

# Using a Self-Checkout Machine

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,035 – Using a Self- Checkout Machine.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,035. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Claudia and Raul  about buying things from the store without ever really talking to anyone. Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: We’re done, right? Let’s get in this cashi er line.

Raul: No need. This store has self-checkout machine s.

Claudia: I don’t know. I think it would be easier g oing through a cashier line.

Raul: Using the self-checkout will be much quicker.  Let me show you. All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery it em.

Claudia: There are no bar codes on fruits and veget ables.

Raul: All you have to do is put them on the scale a nd find the product on the touch screen.

Claudia: You look. I’ll start bagging.

Raul: Wait! You’re supposed to wait until everythin g is scanned before removing items from the bagging area to put in bags. Oh no, now there’s a “see attendant” message on the screen.

Claudia: What do we do now?

Raul: We wait for the attendant to clear the error and void the transaction. Then we start again.

 Claudia: Great. You’re right. This is much faster.

Raul: It is if you know what you’re doing.

Claudia: I’ll tell you what. I’ll take half of our groceries and stand in line and you use the self-checkout. We’ll see which is faster.

Raul: That’s a sucker bet. I have no doubt that I’l l be done before you are.

Claudia: I’m not worried. The last one out the door  makes dinner.

Raul: You’re on. Just remember that I like my steak  well done.

[end of dialogue]

Claudia begins our dialogue by asking Raul, “We’re done, right?” meaning “We agree that we are done now” or “I understand that w e are now finished. Is that correct?” “Let’s get in this cashier line.” A “cash ier” (cashier) is someone who takes your money at a store when you want to buy so mething. A “cashier line” would be a line of people waiting to buy things fro m the store – people who are waiting for the cashier to finish with the person i n front of them so they can then purchase what they came to the store to buy.

However, Raul says, “No need,” meaning we don’t nee d to stand in the cashier line. “This store has self-checkout machines.” The verb “to check out” means to give your money to someone from the store in order to buy what you want to buy. “Self-checkout” is a new system in many American st ores where you don’t have to give your money to a cashier, a person, a live h uman being. Instead, you can give your money to a machine. You basically stand i n front of the machine and the machine reads the information from the packagin g and tells you how much you have to pay.

Claudia says, “I don’t know.” What Claudia means he re is she’s not sure she wants to use the self-checkout machines. She is hes itant. She’s doubting whether this is a good idea. She says, “I think it would be easier to go through a cashier line.” She thinks it’s easier just to talk to human being and have them do all of the necessary things in order to figure out how much money you give them. Raul says, “Using the self-checkout will be much qu icker. Let me show you.” Let me demonstrate how you do this. So, Raul now is going to show Claudia how the self-checkout machine works.

He says, “All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery item.” Claudia and Raul are in a grocery store. A “grocery  store” is a store that sells food. A “bar code” (bar code) is a little square wi th a bunch of black and white lines on it that is used by a computer to identify the specific thing that you are buying. Most things in American stores, including g rocery stores, have these little squares that have lines that are black and white, a nd usually some numbers on the bottom. We call these “bar codes.”

What do you do with the bar code? Well, you have to  put it in front of a machine, and the machine will scan it. “To scan” (scan) basi cally means the machine looks at the code and “reads” it to determine what you are buying. However, there’s a small problem with this system at a grocery store, and Claudia lets us know what that is in the very next sentence. She says, “There  are no bar codes on fruits and vegetables.”

Because each person picks his or her own fruits and  vegetables, there aren’t bar codes on the bags. You put them in your own little bags, and you take them and usually the cashier will look at it and then put in  the right item and amount. However, if you’re using a self-checkout machine, y ou need to do something a little different. And Raul tells us.

He says, “All you have to do is put them on the sca le and find the product on the touch-screen.” Notice that Raul starts this sentenc e by using the phrase “all you have to do.” That’s what he said earlier in the dia logue. It’s a very common phrase when you are explaining something to someone  and indicating that it isn’t difficult – it’s very easy. It’s not complicated.

Raul says, “You need to put the fruits and vegetabl es on this scale (scale).” A “scale” is a device, a machine, that tells you how heavy something is. It weighs the thing or the person. The verb we use when a per son weighs himself is “step on.” “He stepped on the scale to find out how fat h e was.” (Or how skinny – let’s be optimistic.)

Raul says that after you put the fruits and/or vege tables on the scale, you have to find them on the touch-screen. The “touch-screen” i s a flat computer screen that, when you touch it, something happens. It’s sort of like what we now have – tablets like iPads – where you can touch the screen  and something happens. They have these touch-screens with the self-checkou t machines in order to make things quicker. You don’t have to type anything wit h a keyboard.

Claudia says, “You look,” meaning you look for the name of this item, “I’ll start bagging.” “To bag” (bag), as a verb, means to put t hings into a container which is

called, confusingly, a “bag.” A “bag” can be made of plastic or paper or some other material, and we use bags to carry things aro und. When you go to a grocery store in the United States, they usually gi ve you either a paper or a plastic bag. Sometimes they charge you money for the bags, however, so many people bring their own bags from home. So, “to bag”  means to put something in a bag.

Raul says, “Wait! You’re supposed to wait until eve rything is scanned before removing items from the bagging area to put in bags .” The way the self-checkout machines work is that you put things on a flat surf ace, like a little table, called the “bagging area.” After you scan something, you then put it on this small table, but the table itself is connected to the machine, and i t can tell how much weight you are putting on the machine. It’s a way, I guess, for the grocery store company to make sure you’re not cheating. You can’t put things  into bags until you finished scanning all of your items. That’s what Raul says.

He says, “Oh no, now there’s a ‘see attendant’ mess age on the screen.” An “attendant” (attendant) is a person who works for, in this case, a store to help customers find things. The attendant here is helpin g customers use the self- checkout machine. So yes, although you don’t talk t o anyone, you do everything yourself in self-checkout, there will be an employe e from the store, an attendant, who will help you if you need help with the machine .

What happened is that Claudia made a mistake, and t he machine stopped and put a message on the screen which said “see attenda nt,” meaning you have to talk to the employee. Claudia says, “What do we do now?” Raul says, “We wait for the attendant to clear the error and void the t ransaction then we start again.” “To clear” (clear) means to delete or to erase some thing. “To void (void) a transaction” means basically to undo a sale – make something as though it had never happened.

So, let’s say you’re buying something at the store and the cashier makes a mistake, or you make a mistake, you give the cashie r the wrong thing. You can then say, “Oh no, no, I don’t want that.” The cashi er can “void the transaction.” A “transaction” is just, in this case, another word f or the sale of something. The cashier voids the transaction as though it had neve r existed. You delete it. You get rid of it. You erase it.

Claudia is not very happy that she now has to wait for the attendant. She says, “Great. You’re right. This is much faster.” Claudia  is being sarcastic here. She’s making a joke. She doesn’t think it’s much faster. She thinks the self-checkout is taking them longer than it would if they had used a  cashier. Raul says, “It is” –

meaning it is faster – “if you know what you’re doi ng.” Raul is saying that had Claudia not made a mistake, it would’ve been faster .

Claudia says, “I’ll tell you what. I’ll take half of our groceries and stand in line, and you use the self-checkout. We’ll see which is faste r.” The expression “I’ll tell you what” is an informal one used to present or propose  an idea to someone. You are giving someone an idea usually that has some sort of “If you do this, then that will happen.” “I’ll tell you what. If you give me $20, I  will give you a free English lesson.” “I’ll tell you what” is a way of introduci ng a proposal, something that I will do for you if you do something for me.

Here, it’s about Claudia and Raul each doing someth ing different. Claudia is going to go to the cashier, the human being, to buy  half of the groceries, half of the food that they are purchasing. Raul is going to  take the other half and go through the self-checkout machine, then they’ll see  who gets finished first – who “gets through the line,” if you will, or who checks  out first.

Raul says, “That’s a sucker bet. I have no doubt th at I’ll be done before you are.” A “sucker (sucker) bet (bet)” is a gambling offer t hat only someone who perhaps is inexperienced or not very intelligent would acce pt. The word “sucker” is used to describe someone who is a fool, someone who is e asily deceived, someone who other people, we would say, “take advantage of. ” A sucker bet would be a bet that only a stupid person would accept.

Claudia says, “I’m not worried. The last one out the door makes dinner.” “The last one out the door” means the person who finishes las t, the person who gets through the checkout process last, has to make dinn er. Raul says, “You’re on.” When you challenge someone to do something or you b et someone, one common way of replying is to say, “You’re on.” So, I say to you, “If you give me $20, I will teach you English.” You say, “You’re on ,” meaning “Yes, I’ll do that.” Normally, however, it’s when you’re betting about s omething.

Raul says, “Just remember that I like my steak well  done.” Raul is assuming that he’s going to win the bet, and he’s already telling  Claudia how he wants his steak cooked. He wants his steak, which is a thick piece of beef, “well done,” meaning there isn’t any redness inside of the meat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: We’re done, right? Let’s get in this cashi er line.

 Raul: No need. This store has self-checkout machine s.

Claudia: I don’t know. I think it would be easier g oing through a cashier line.

Raul: Using the self-checkout will be much quicker.  Let me show you. All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery it em.

Claudia: There are no bar codes on fruits and veget ables.

Raul: All you have to do is put them on the scale a nd find the product on the touch-screen.

# Farming and Agribusiness

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,036 – Farming and Agribusiness.

This episode is a dialogue between Brad and Irene a bout farming – growing food. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Brad: Is this your first visit to this area?

Irene: It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farm s. I thought farming was a dying industry.

Brad: Family farms and small-scale farming are disa ppearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.

Irene: Are they lucrative?

Brad: They can be, but the subsidies were originall y given to protect the livelihood of farmers.

Irene: And that’s not what’s happening?

Brad: Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game. A lot of small-scale farmers have  thrown in the towel.

Irene: That’s a shame, but the subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?

Brad: That may be, but we’re losing a way of life. I come from a long line of farmers.

Irene: And you’re not farming?

 Brad: Nope.

Irene: What do you do?

Brad: I work for the government agency that gives o ut subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.

Irene: That’s quite a twist of fate.

Brad: You said it.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Brad asking Irene, “Is thi s your first visit to this area?” Is this the first time you have been here? Irene says,  “It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farms. I thought farming was a dying indust ry.” A “farm” is a large area of land where food is grown and animals are also ke pt, animals that are used eventually for food.

Irene thought that “farming was a dying industry.” An “industry” (industry) is a business, or more properly a kind of business – a p art of the economy that includes similar kinds of businesses. So, we could have the “movie industry.” That would include all of the companies here in Los  Angeles and other places that make movies.

Irene thought that farming was “a dying industry.” “Dying” comes from the verb “to die.” “To die” means to stop living, to no long er be living. “Dying” implies that something is still alive, but it’s going to be dead  very soon. The idea here is that not that many people are going into farming and tha t the business of farming won’t be around for a long time, at least in the ar ea that Brad and Irene are talking about.

Brad says, however, “Family farms and small-scale f arming are disappearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to governmen t subsidies.” A “family farm” would be a farm owned by – that’s correct – a singl e family. Back in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, most farms were probably owned by individual families that grew food for themselves a nd, of course, to sell to other people.

However, during the 1970s and 80s, many of these fa mily farms disappeared – that is, they were no longer able to be profitable,  and so the families either sold

the farm to a large business or to someone who want ed to do something else with the land. “Agribusiness” (agribusiness) is for med from two different words, “agriculture” and “business.” “Agriculture” is anot her word to describe the growing of food. “Agribusiness” is a word we use to describ e large companies that own farms.

Brad says that “agribusiness is alive and well.” Th at expression “to be alive and well” is quite common in English. It means to be do ing very well, to have a lot of success. The agribusinesses are successful, accordi ng to Brad, “thanks to” – or because of –“government subsidies.” A “subsidy” (su bsidy) is when someone gives you money to do something. In the United Stat es, as in many countries, the government tries to protect farms and to protect the agricultural business by giving businesses and farmers money – money to grow  certain kinds of food.

Now, the economic reasoning for this activity is so mewhat questionable, according to some economists. Many economists say i t doesn’t make sense for the government to pay people in farming when they d on’t pay people in other businesses in order to survive. Of course, there are arguments on the other side – that is, there are people who think it does do so me good.

Irene says, “Are they lucrative?” “They” here refer s to the businesses involved in agriculture. The word “lucrative” (lucrative) means  profitable. It means making a lot of money. If your business is lucrative, you are making a lot of money, you are getting rich. Brad says, “They can be,” meaning the se businesses can be lucrative, “but the subsidies were originally given  to protect the livelihood of farmers.”

Brad explains why the government started giving sub sidies to farmers many years ago. The reason, and the reason that many gov ernments give, for the subsidies is “to protect the livelihood of farmers. ” “Livelihood” (livelihood) refers to one’s job or career – how you make a living, how yo u make money. My livelihood is working for the Center for Educational Developme nt doing these podcasts. Other people’s livelihoods depend on different jobs  that they have.

The “livelihood of farmers,” then, refers to the ec onomic wellbeing of farmers, the jobs of farmers. When most farms were owned by fami lies, the government felt it was important to protect these families to make sur e that they didn’t, if you will, “go out of business.” Irene says, “And that’s not w hat’s happening?” She’s questioning Brad, asking him if that is not still t he purpose of these government subsidies.

Brad says, “Well, agribusiness has edged out small- scale farms because output is the name of the game.” The phrasal verb “to edge  (edge) – out” means to do better than someone or something else so that you b ecome more powerful and the other person or thing becomes less powerful, le ss influential, less successful. Brad is saying that agribusiness “has edged out sma ll-scale” – small – “farms.” It has become more successful. Why? Brad explains that  “output is the name of the game.” “Output” is what you produce, what you make.

Agribusinesses are large companies that produce a l ot of food, and that makes them more successful. The phrase “the name of the g ame” means the most important thing in deciding how the way things are done. The name of the game in college is getting good grades and saying nice t hings to your professor, which gives you good grades. Well, that’s not exactly tru e. Just because you say something nice to your professor doesn’t mean he or  she will give you a good grade, but in my own experience, it doesn’t hurt – meaning it will never harm you.

The name of the game here in agribusiness is “outpu t” – is producing a lot of food. Brad says, “A lot of small-scale farmers have  thrown in the towel.” The expression “to throw in the towel” (towel) means to  give up, to stop trying, especially when something seems too difficult. Iren e responds, “That’s a shame.” The expression “that’s a shame” (shame) is used to express sadness about something that is happening, especially something t hat seems unfair, unjust.

Irene says “The subsidies are still used to protect  domestic food production, right?” “Domestic” (domestic) here means within the  country. The opposite of domestic would be “international.” This is another reason why governments give subsidies to farmers. It’s to protect the productio n of food within the country, so that in case there is a war or other problems, they  don’t have to rely on or depend on other countries in order to get their foo d. At least, that’s one of the official reasons given. I think it probably is more  political than that, but we won’t get into that here.

Brad says, “That may be,” meaning yes, it’s possibl e that these subsidies are used to protect domestic food production. “But,” he  says, “we’re losing a way of life.” A “way of life” is a way of living, the way things are done, the culture of that particular area. Brad says, “I come from a long lin e of farmers.” If you say “I come from a long line” of something, you mean that you h ave many family members involved in a particular business or industry or ar ea. There is also the implication here that this has been going on for many years, pe rhaps many generations.

For example, I come from a long line of plumbers – people who fix toilets and sinks. My grandfather was a plumber. My uncles were  plumbers. My father was

not a plumber – he was a teacher – but the McQuilla ns are known in the place where I grew up, St. Paul, Minnesota, as plumbers, and still today my cousins own McQuillan Brothers Plumbing. So, I come from a long line of plumbers. I can also say I come from a long line of teachers, becau se my father is a teacher, my sister and two of my brothers were teachers, I have  nieces who are teachers. But we’re talking not about me, but about Brad.

Brad is asked by Irene, “And you’re not farming?” B rad says, “Nope.” “Nope” is an informal way of saying no. Irene says, “What do you do?” Brad says, “I work for the government agency,” the part of the governm ent, “that gives out subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.” Bra d says that he works for the government agency, the part of the government, that  actually gives the money, the subsidies, to these large agribusinesses. He us es the term “the very farms that put us out of business.”

The use of the word “very” here means these precise , or exact, things. It’s a word used to emphasize the next word, the following word . Usually this construction, this word, is used when you are pointing out someth ing that is ironic, something that seems contradictory. For example, you could say “The very parents who complain about the schools not doing their job are the ones that never help their children with their homework.” That’s not true, but  that would be an example of using this word “very” to specify a group who seems  to be acting in some contradictory manner.

Irene says, “That’s quite a twist of fate.” A “twis t (twist) of fate (fate)” is an unexpected change in events, especially one that is  ironic. So in this case, Brad used to work on a family farm, and now he works for  the government agency that gives money to the agribusinesses that in some ways  put the family farms out of business. So, it’s “ironic” (ironic). It’s the oppo site of what you would expect.

Brad ends the dialogue by saying, “You said it.” Th at expression “you said it” is often used when you want to agree with what the oth er person has said and emphasize how correct the other person is. I’d say we use this expression when the other person is saying something negative. For example, it’s really cold in here. You might say, “You said it.” It is cold in h ere. You are agreeing with the other person and emphasizing how correct you think the other person is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Brad: Is this your first visit to this area?

 Irene: It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farm s. I thought farming was a dying industry.

Brad: Family farms and small-scale farming are disa ppearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.

Irene: Are they lucrative?

Brad: They can be, but the subsidies were originall y given to protect the livelihood of farmers.

Irene: And that’s not what’s happening?

Brad: Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game. A lot of small-scale farmers have  thrown in the towel.

Irene: That’s a shame, but the subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?

Brad: That may be, but we’re losing a way of life. I come from a long line of farmers.

Irene: And you’re not farming?

Brad: Nope.

Irene: What do you do?

Brad: I work for the government agency that gives o ut subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.

Irene: That’s quite a twist of fate.

Brad: You said it.

This episode is a dialogue between Gunther and Mari a about stopping, or ending, a party. Doesn’t sound like too much fun, d oes it? Well, let’s join the party and find out.

Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gunther: I think this party has run its course, and  I’m ready to call it a night.

Maria: But there are still a few stragglers who see m reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?

Gunther: I’ll just make an announcement.

Maria: Wait! That seems kind of rude. Let me try a few hints. I’ll tell them that we’re out of drinks.

Gunther: If you do that, one of those guys is liabl e to offer to make a beer run. That’s not going to do the trick.

Maria: What if I go over there, yawn, and comment o n the lateness of the hour? That should be obvious enough without being too rud e.

Gunther: Those people aren’t going to respond to su btlety. Let me handle this.

Maria: What are you going to do?

Gunther: I’m going to do what bars do at closing ti me. I’m turning up the lights and turning off the music.

Maria: And if that doesn’t work?

Gunther: I’m going to yell “Lights out, people!” an d mean it!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gunther saying to Maria, “ I think this party has run its course and I’mready to call it a night.” There are two expressions or phrases in this first line of the dialogue that we want to exp lain. The first one is for something “to run its course” (course). “To run its  course” means that something has naturally completed whatever process or perhaps  cycle is involved here. It really means that the party is no longer entertaini ng. It’s no longer fun. It’s coming to an end. You had a good time, but now it’s  time to go. That’s the idea that Gunther is trying to communicate here.

The phrase “to run its course” is often used in med icine to talk about, for example, a disease or an illness that is temporary.  There are some illnesses, such as the common cold and flu, that sometimes jus t have to run their course. They are not illnesses that are easy to cure or eve n to help, sometimes. You just have to let the disease go through its stages until  it’s all over.

The other expression from this first line that I wa nt to explain is “to call it a night.” “To call it a night” means to say that you are goin g home. You are not going to stay at whatever event or party you are at. So, if you go to someone’s house for dinner and you stay until 10 o’clock or 11 o’clock and then you want to go, you would say to the person, “I think I’m going to call  it a night,” meaning I’m going to leave now and go home. I don’t want to be here anym ore.

Maria says, “But there are still a few stragglers w ho seem reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?” We realize in  this second line of the dialogue that Maria and Gunther are having a party at their own house. Maria says there are still a few “stragglers” (stragglers ). A “straggler” is one of the last people to finish something, or one of the last few people to continue doing something.

Let’s say you go on a tour and the tour bus leaves at eight o’clock in the morning. You get there at 7:45, and at eight o’clock, the bu s is ready to leave, but some people have not yet arrived from your group. So the y come in at 8:05 or 8:10. We would call those final few people the “stragglers.”  There’s sometimes a negative

connotation about this word “straggler.” It suggest s that the person is late or is very slow.

Maria says these few stragglers seem reluctant to l eave. “To be reluctant” (reluctant) means to not want to do something, to n ot look forward to doing something. We might also say that it means “to be h esitant” (hesitant). The stragglers are reluctant to leave. You could be rel uctant to go to school. You could be reluctant to go to your mother-in-law’s ho use. These are all very logical, perhaps even common, experiences. Maria says, “How do we politely tell them to go home?” To do something “politely” (politely) mea ns nicely, courteously, with good manners.

Gunther says, “I’ll make an announcement”; I’ll jus t tell everybody. Maria says, “Wait!” meaning stop. “That seems kind of rude” – n ot nice. “Let me try a few hints.” A “hint” (hint) is, in this case, a gentle suggestion, an indication about what you are talking about or what you want without sayi ng it directly. A “hint” in other context can also mean a clue – information about so me mystery or problem. Here, however, it just means an indirect way of com municating a message.

Maria says that she’ll tell her guests that they are out of drinks – they have no more alcohol, let’s say, to drink. Gunther says, “I f you do that, one of those guys is liable to offer to make a beer run.” The word “l iable” (liable) here means likely or probable, something that could and probably will  happen. “Liable” also has some other meanings that are related to the law. “T o be liable” for something means to be responsible for something, often financ ially responsible for something, but here it just means “likely.”

One of the guys, according to Gunther, is likely “t o offer to make a beer run.” A “beer (beer) run” is a quick trip to a store, a liq uor store, to buy more beer. We sometimes use that word “run” to talk about doing a  very short trip for one specific purpose, often to buy something. If it’s e ight o’clock at night and you’re feeling hungry, you might say to your husband, “Let ’s go for a doughnut run.” That would mean let’s go out and buy some doughnuts , which sounds really good right now. But again, so does a beer.

Gunther says, “That’s not going to do the trick.” “ To do the trick” means to be successful, to reach your goal or objective. Gunthe r is saying that telling their guests that they have run out of drinks will not be  effective. That won’t work. It won’t do the trick (trick).

Maria then makes another suggestion to Gunther: “What if I go over there,” where the people are standing, “yawn, and comment o n the lateness of the

hour?” “To yawn” (yawn) is to open your mouth wide and take a deep breath, usually sighing outwards. It’s better and easier to  simply illustrate this. A “yawn” would be something like [yawns]. Interestingly enou gh, I believe that when one person yawns, it often causes other people to yawn.  So, if you just yawned yourself, well, there you go. It did the trick.

Maria is going to yawn because when someone yawns, it often indicates that he is tired. She’s going to try to indicate to her gue sts that it’s getting late. In fact, she’s going to “comment on the lateness of the hour .” The “lateness of the hour” simply means how late it is getting, how it is time  for people to go home and go to sleep. Maria says that should be obvious enough wit hout being too rude.

Gunther says, “Those people aren’t going to respond  to subtlety.” “Subtlety” (subtlety) is being very indirect. “Subtlety” is in directness, not being direct with someone. It’s similar to hinting. Gunther says, “Le t me handle this,” meaning let me take care of this. Maria then asks, “What are yo u going to do?” Gunther says, “I’m going to do what bars do at closing time.” A “ bar” is a place where you go and get an alcoholic drink. He says, “I’m turning u p the lights and turning off the music.”

Sometimes in a bar, when they are ready to close, t he owners will turn off the music and turn up the lights. Some lights can be ma de to be less bright, and that’s the case in a bar. Usually, if you go into a  bar, there aren’t really bright lights shining on you – that’s because people are d rinking, and they don’t want to see bright lights. “To turn up the lights” would be  to go from the room being sort of dark to suddenly being very bright.

Maria says, “And if that doesn’t work? Gunther says , “I’m going to yell” – say very loudly – “‘Lights out, people!’ and mean it.” “Ligh ts out” means that it’s time to go to sleep, to turn off the lights and go to sleep. I t’s something that, for example, a father or mother might say to his or her children w hen it’s time for them to go to bed. The parent might send the child to his room an d then turn the lights off and say something like “Lights out,” meaning it’s time to turn the lights off. You might also hear that expression in the military when it’s  time for everyone to go to bed, to go to sleep.

Gunther says he’s “going to yell ‘Lights out people !’ and mean it.” “To mean” (mean) something means to really believe it, to act ually do what you say you are going to do. We sometimes use this phrase when some one doesn’t believe that you are going to do what you say you’re going to do . So, a parent may say again to his or her child, “If you don’t go to sleep righ t now, you’re not going to get any candy tomorrow. I mean it.” The parent is emphasizi ng that he or she is serious

and will actually do what he or she says that he or  she will do. Wives also speak this way sometimes to their husbands.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gunther: I think this party has run its course, and  I’m ready to call it a night.

Maria: But there are still a few stragglers who see m reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?

Gunther: I’ll just make an announcement.

Maria: Wait! That seems kind of rude. Let me try a few hints. I’ll tell them that we’re out of drinks.

This episode is a dialogue between Lily and Omid ab out kinds of apartments. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lily: Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment, but I think I’m lost. I’m supposed to be there in 1 0 minutes, but I can’t find it. There are four different apartment complexes locate d next to each other and they look identical.

Omid: Don’t you have the address?

Lily: Yes, but all of the complexes in this subdivi sion look the same, and I don’t see a street number on any of them.

Omid: Are you sure we’re looking for a block of apa rtments? Maybe the apartment is in a mixed-use building, like that one  over there.

Lily: I’m pretty sure. At least I know it’s in a hi gh-rise building and the apartment is on the eighth floor. That mixed-use building is only three stories high.

Omid: Oh, then it’s not a duplex or triplex, like t hose over there.

Lily: No, it’s definitely not one of those. I’d bet ter call the rental agent and get directions.

Omid: Hey, look over there. I see a couple of the r esidents of that building walking out. Let’s ask them. Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh, they didn’t hear me.

Lily: I’ll just make the call.

Omid: Well, you can be sure of one thing if you mov e into one of these complexes.

Lily: What?

Omid: The bill collectors will never be able to fin d you!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins today with Lily saying to Omid,  “Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment.” A “ rental agent” is a person whose job it is to help people find a home or an ap artment to rent. It’s a person who helps people who are renting, also, to find som eone to rent their apartment or home.

The word “agent” (agent), when describing a person,  often refers to someone who represents the interests of another party – ano ther person or organization. We have “real estate agents” who are responsible for buying and selling homes or helping people buy and sell homes.

Lily is going with Omid to meet a rental agent who’ s going to show them an apartment. When we say “apartment” in American Engl ish, we’re usually referring to a room or set of rooms in a building. The rooms are all connected. There’s typically a bedroom and a living room and a kitchen  and a bathroom. Usually the rooms are on one level, or one “floor.” An apartmen t is what someone can rent to live in.

There are other kinds of properties that you can re nt. Condominiums are also one-level, typically, living units or areas. Howeve r, an apartment is rented, whereas a condominium is typically owned by someone . Now, you could own a condominium and then rent it, so the distinction ge ts a little fuzzy – it gets a little difficult to make.

There are a couple of other terms that we use when talking about rental properties. One of them is “townhouse.” A “townhous e” is typically an apartment that’s more than one level, that’s more than one st ory – that has a first level and a second level, possibly even a third level. Here, however, we’re looking at an apartment. Lily says, “I think I’m lost. I’m suppos ed to be there in 10 minutes, but I can’t find it.” Lily says she’s “lost,” meaning s he doesn’t know where she is.

She then says, “There are four different apartment complexes located next to each other and they look identical.” An “apartment complex” (complex) is a set of buildings, usually, that look the same or very simi lar, that are next to each other and usually owned by the same company. An apartment  complex usually implies that there is more than one building – at least two , and often several buildings next to each other.

Because these buildings are all built by the same c ompany, they often look identical. “Identical” (identical) means exactly the same. You can have “identical twins,” two babies born at the same time that look almost exactly alike. I have two brothers who are identical twins. But back to o ur story.

Omid says, “Don’t you have the address?” Lily says “Yes, but all of the complexes in this subdivision look the same and I d on’t see a street number on any of them.” A “subdivision” is an area of land th at is usually divided and developed by a single company. When I say “develope d,” I mean the company that owns the land builds either houses or apartmen t buildings and then sells the houses to people – individual families and people wanting to buy houses – or it owns a set of buildings that have apartments in the m that are rented.

Lily says she doesn’t see a street number on the bu ildings. A “street number” is the numerical part of an address, the numbered part  of an address. So, if the address were 1257 Main Street, the street number wo uld be 1-2-5-7 (1257). Notice we don’t say “one thousand two hundred and f ifty-seven.” We just say either the individual numbers (1-2-5-7) or we group  them in groups of two or three. So, 12-57.

Omid says, “Are you sure you’re looking for a block  of apartments?” A “block” (block) is normally, when we’re talking about a tow n or city, a square or rectangular area that is surrounded by four streets . Some of these apartment complexes are so big that they take up an entire bl ock. Omid says that perhaps the apartment is not in a block of apartments.

“Maybe it’s a mixed-use building like that one over  there,” he says. “Mixed-use” is a building that has both businesses and apartments or condominiums in it. In big cities, it’s often the case that, especially in the  downtown or central area of town, a building will be built where the first and perhap s second floors of the building are businesses – stores, offices – and the upper st ories, the upper levels of the building, are condominiums or apartments. This is c alled a “mixed-use building.”

But Lily says, “I’m pretty sure,” meaning she’s fai rly certain that she’s looking for a block of apartments. She says, “At least I know i t’s a high-rise building and the

apartment is on the eighth floor. That mixed-use bu ilding is only three stories high.” A “high-rise (rise) building” is a very tall  building. If it’s a business building and it’s really tall, we might call it a “skyscrape r.”

A “high-rise” could be a tall apartment building. U sually the building is several floors tall. A “floor” is the same as a level. The word “story” is also used to mean level or floor when we’re talking about a building.  Lily says that the apartment she’s looking for is “on the eighth floor.” Now, in  the United States, the ground level – the level that you walk into from the stree t – is considered the first floor. In other countries, the first floor is actually the fl oor that’s one above the ground floor.

That’s why Americans sometimes get confused when th ey go to Europe, for example, and someone says it’s on the first floor, but the floor is not the one that’s on the ground. It’s the one that’s above the  one on the ground. Americans would call that the second floor. We don’t have a f loor zero; we just have a first, second, third, fourth, and so on floor. The mixed-u se building that Omid is pointing out to Lily is a three-story-high building . Lily says the building “is only three stories high.” That means it’s three levels, three floors, high.

Omid says, “Oh, then it’s not a duplex or a triplex , like those over there.” A “duplex” (duplex) is a building with two apartments , usually one on the first floor and one on the second floor. Each apartment has its  own entrance, there’s separate living areas, and they’re rented separatel y. A triplex (you can probably guess from the prefix “tri-”) is a building with th ree apartments. We also sometimes use the word “fourplex” for a building wi th four apartments. Lily says, “No, it’s not a duplex or a triplex.”

She says, “I’d better call” – I ought to, I should call – “the rental agent and get directions.” Omid says, “Hey, look over there. I se e a couple of residents of that building walking out. Let’s ask them.” A “resident”  is a person who lives in a particular area or a particular building. I am a re sident of Los Angeles. That’s where I live. That’s my permanent home.

Omid says that there are a couple of residents walk ing out of one of the buildings, and so perhaps he and Lily should go ove r and ask them. Omid goes over and says, “Excuse me.” “Excuse me” – that’s ho w we get someone’s attention in a polite way. “Oh, they didn’t hear me ,” Omid says. Lily says, “I’ll just make the call,” meaning I’ll just call the rental a gent.

Omid says, “Well, you can be sure of one thing if y ou move into one of these complexes.” Lily says, “What?” Omid says, “The bill  collectors will never be able

to find you.” Omid is making a joke here. He’s sayi ng that it’s so difficult to find these buildings that no one would be able to find t hem, even people who are looking for you, such as bill collectors.

What is a “bill collector?” A bill collector is a p erson who goes and finds people who haven’t paid their bills – money they owe to a company – and gets them to pay them. If, for example, you buy a telephone, and  you use the telephone but then you don’t pay for the minutes that you use, the telephone company will try to find you and get you to pay for them. They will usu ally hire another company – a collection agency – that will go and try to find yo u and call you and go to your house to get the money from you. That is a bill col lector.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lily: Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment, but I think I’m lost. I’m supposed to be there in 1 0 minutes, but I can’t find it. There are four different apartment complexes locate d next to each other and they look identical.

Omid: Don’t you have the address?

# Taking a Test Drive

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mario and Leah about buying a new car. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mario: I’d like to test drive the new Racer.

Leah: Sure, all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a test drive. May I see your driver’s license?

Mario: Here it is.

Leah: Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get into the driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat? All right, please buckle u p and you can drive it around the block.

Mario: I think I may need to drive it a little fart her to get a feel for the car.

Leah: That’s fine, but you’ll need to slow down!

Mario: Slow down? How will I know if this car is ri ght for my driving style if I don’t put the pedal to the metal and put it through its p aces?

Leah: I understand you want to get a complete drivi ng experience, but unless you stop driving recklessly, we’ll need to return to the car lot.

Mario: You call this reckless? This isn’t reckless.  It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving  a car the way it should be driven.

Leah: Well, an interesting way of looking at it. Uh , I think we’d better head back to the car lot. I’m feeling a little nauseous.

Mario: Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a car d riven by a racecar driver before.

Leah: That’s right.

Mario: Then this is your lucky day!

[end of dialogue]

Mario says to Leah, “I’d like to test drive the new  Racer.” The “Racer” is a name of a car, an imaginary car. Mario wants to test dri ve the car. “To test drive” is to drive a car that you’re thinking of buying, a car t hat someone is selling. You want to see if you like the car before you buy it, so yo u take it for a test drive – or, to use the verb, you “test drive the car.” The word “t est” in English in this case means to try something – to do something in prepara tion, often, for something else. We also use the word “test” when we are talki ng about giving someone an examination in school, for example.

Leah says, “Sure, all prospective buyers can take o ne of our cars for a test drive.” Leah works for the place that sells these c ars. We call that place a “car lot” – or, if they sell new cars, we call it a “dea lership.” Leah says that “all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a t est drive.” A “prospective (prospective) buyer” is a possible or potential buy er. We can talk about a “prospective student” – someone who isn’t a student  yet, but might be a student in the future. It’s possible.

Leah then asks Mario, “May I see your driver’s lice nse?” Your “driver’s license” (license) is a small card given by, in the United S tates, the state government that gives you permission to drive a car. Here in the U. S. we don’t have a national driver’s license. Each state or territory issues, o r gives you, a driver’s license. Now normally, the driver’s license allows you to dr ive anywhere in the United States, even outside of your own state.

However, if you move from one state to another, you  often have to take another driving test in order to get a driver’s license fro m a different state. The reason for

that is that states have slightly different rules a bout driving, although most of the rules are the same. Mario says, “Here it is.” He’s giving Leah his driver’s license. Leah says, “Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get i nto the driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat.” The “seat” (seat) is where you sit in a car. The “driver’s seat” is, in an American car, on the left -hand side of the car. That’s where the driver sits, who controls the car.

All the other seats in the car are called “passenge r seats.” A “passenger” (passenger) is any person who is riding in the car who is not the driver. You could also be a passenger on a train or a passenger  on a boat. You could be a passenger on an airplane. As long as you’re not the  one controlling the vehicle, you are a passenger. Although on an airplane, there  are other people on the airplane who are not controlling the airplane. We w ould not call them “passengers,” typically; they would be members of t he airline staff. But back to our story.

Leah is telling Mario to “get into the driver’s sea t.” Notice we use that phrasal verb “to get into” for getting into a seat, for sit ting down in the seat. Leah says, “All right, please buckle up and you can drive it a round the block.” “To buckle (buckle) up” means to put your seatbelt on. A “seat  belt” is a strap, a piece of material, that holds your body into the seat of the  car in case there’s an accident.

In the United States, I believe in every state – I could be wrong – there are laws that require you to wear a seatbelt, especially if you are in the front of the car. In California, you are required to wear a seatbelt in any of the seats in the car, the driver’s seat or a passenger seat. If you don’t wea r your seatbelt, you can get fined. You can get what we would call a “ticket” fr om the police. You’ll have to pay money and maybe even go to jail – although you probably won’t go to jail if you don’t buckle up, but you’ll definitely get a ti cket from the police.

Leah tells Mario he can drive “around the block.” A  “block” (block) is a square or rectangular area that is surrounded by four streets . Mario says, “I think I may need to drive it a little farther to get a feel for  the car.” “Farther” (farther) means at a great distance, or involving a large distance. “F arther” is used for physical distances. Mario is saying that he may need to driv e the car more than just around the block in order to “get a feel for the ca r.” “To get a feel (feel) for” something means to become familiar with something, to understand what something is like.

Mario is saying that he needs to drive the car for a longer period of time or for a longer distance in order to really see if he likes the car not. That’s what he means here. Leah says, “That’s fine, but you’ll need to s low down.” She’s telling Mario

not to drive so fast. Mario says, “Slow down?” He’s  confused. “How will I know if this car is right for my driving style if I don’t p ut the pedal to the metal and put it through its paces?”

Mario is asking how he can know if this is the righ t car for him, if this is the right car for his “driving style,” if he doesn’t “put the  pedal to the metal.” Your “driving style” is the way that you like to drive. Some peop le drive fast. Some people drive slow. Some people drive like idiots, such as here i n Los Angeles. The driving style of Mario is to go fast. That’s what he means by the expression “put the pedal (pedal) to the metal (metal).” “To put the pe dal to the metal” is an old expression meaning to drive a car really fast.

The “pedal” is the thing that your foot steps on in  order to make the car go faster. The “metal” would be the car itself – the metal of the car, I suppose. “To put the pedal to the metal” means to drive really fast. Mar io wants to do this in order “to put the car through its paces” (paces). “To put som ething through its paces” means to use the machine or whatever it is that you r testing at the maximum capacity to determine the limits of what it can do.

So, if you are putting a car through its paces, you  would want to drive the car very fast, or perhaps you would want to go around i n circles to see how well the car handles, how well it drives, going around in ci rcles. In general, to put something through its paces means to test it to see  how much it can do of whatever it is the thing is supposed to do. If I wa s going to put my computer through its paces, I might, for example run a bunch  of different programs at the same time and see how quickly or how slowly the pro grams operated.

Leah is a little worried here. She says, “I underst and you want to get a complete driving experience, but unless you stop driving rec klessly, we’ll need to return to the car lot.” “To drive recklessly” (recklessly) me ans to drive without being careful – carelessly, dangerously. The “car lot” is the pla ce where the cars are kept, where they are parked. Mario says, “You call this r eckless?” “You call” is an expression we use to mean “Are you saying that this  is something?” Mario’s asking Leah if she considers the way he is driving to be reckless. Obviously, Mario doesn’t.

In fact, he says, “This isn’t reckless. It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving a car the way it should be driven.” “Tires” (tires) are the pieces of rubber that go around the  wheel on the car. The verb “to screech” (screech) means to make a very loud, high pitched sound. This would be an example of a tire screeching. Mario says if y ou don’t hear the tires

screeching, you’re not driving a car correctly. Of course, most people would say just the opposite – that you driving the car too fa st.

Leah says, “Well, an interesting way of looking at it.” She’s trying to be polite because, of course, Mario is a prospective buyer of  this car. She doesn’t want to make him angry, but she also doesn’t want to die. S he says, “Uh, I think we’d better head back,” meaning return, “to the car lot.  I’m feeling a little nauseous.” If you feel “nauseous” (nauseous), you feel as though you might vomit, or throw up. Your stomach is not right and you feel sick.

Mario says, “Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a  car driven by a race car driver before?” A “race car driver” is someone who drives cars very quickly in a competition such as the Indianapolis 500 or other c ar competitions where people drive cars very fast. Leah says, “That’s right.” Ma rio says, “Then this is your lucky day.” Mario thinks it’s a good thing for Leah to be  driving with him, and Leah does not agree.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mario: I’d like to test drive the new Racer.

Leah: Sure, all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a test drive. May I see your driver’s license?

Mario: Here it is.

Leah: Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get into the driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat? All right, please buckle u p and you can drive it around the block.

Mario: I think I may need to drive it a little fart her to get a feel for the car.

Leah: That’s fine, but you’ll need to slow down!

Mario: Slow down? How will I know if this car is ri ght for my driving style if I don’t put the pedal to the metal and put it through its p aces?

Leah: I understand you want to get a complete drivi ng experience, but unless you stop driving recklessly, we’ll need to return to the car lot.

 Mario: You call this reckless? This isn’t reckless.  It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving  a car the way it should be driven.

Leah: Well, an interesting way of looking at it. Uh , I think we’d better head back to the car lot. I’m feeling a little nauseous.

Mario: Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a car d riven by a racecar driver before.

Leah: That’s right.

Mario: Then this is your lucky day!

This episode is going to be a dialogue between Jogi  and Deborah about having to deal with, or have an interaction with, a large organization. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jogi: I knew when we got this government contract t hat it would be a two-edged sword.

Deborah: How so?

Jogi: I’m grateful for the work, but having to jump  through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out .

Deborah: What’s wrong now?

Jogi: You know that all of our documents have to be  submitted in triplicate. I anticipated that and had done everything to the let ter, or so I thought.

Deborah: I know. I helped you prepare those documen ts. What’s the problem?

Jogi: The documents were sent back to us because th ey say we didn’t follow some of the reporting regulations. But the verbiage  in the regulations is so convoluted that I had to interpret them to the best  of my ability. I thought I had done everything right.

Deborah: Didn’t they tell you what they thought was  done wrong when they returned the documents?

Jogi: All I got was a form letter with no specifics .

Deborah: I suggest calling the office responsible f or reviewing the documents and asking someone there.

Jogi: You don’t think I’ve tried? Each time I think  I have the right department and leave a voicemail message, either I don’t hear back  or I get palmed off on another office. I can’t get a straight answer to an y of my questions. I never expected this much red tape.

Deborah: So I see what you mean about that two-edge d sword.

Jogi: I can think of one good use for that sword ri ght now – to put me out of my misery!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Dealing with Bureaucracy.” “Bureaucracy” is a large, usually complicated organizational system, or compl icated and complex organization that has a lot of different requiremen ts, often involving what we call “paperwork” – filling out forms, submitting documen ts, that sort of thing.

Almost every government has a large bureaucracy, a complicated system of offices and departments and “bureaus,” which is jus t another name for a division of the government. We can also have a bureaucracy i n a large company, but usually we associate it with the government and wit h “inefficiency” – with not being a very fast or efficient way to do something.

This dialogue is about dealing with bureaucracy, an d it begins with Jogi saying, “I knew when I got this government contract that it wo uld be a two-edged sword.” A “contract” is a legal agreement, an official agreem ent, between two people or two organizations, each promising to do something for t he other.

Jogi has a contract with the government, but he cal ls it a “two-edged sword.” “Two-edged” (edged) refers to a knife or some sharp  object that is sharp on both sides. A “sword” (sword) is like a large knife that  you would use to fight someone or kill someone. The meaning of the phrase, however , is that this is a situation that has some advantages and some disadvantages – s ome good things and some bad things.

Having a government contract is, according to Jogi,  “a two-edged sword,” meaning there are good things about it and there are bad things about it.

Deborah says, “How so?” “How so?” means “How is it a two-edged sword?” in this case. We use this question “How so?” when we want someone to give us a more detailed explanation. Jogi does that. He says,  “I’m grateful” – I’m thankful – “for the work, but having to jump through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out.”

The phrase “to jump through hoops” (hoops) means to  have to do many different small, often difficult tasks that don’t seem to hav e any real purpose, but that are required to get what you want. Government agencies and offices often require that you fill out lots of forms. You give them this  piece of paper, you give them this piece of information – it seems like they’re a sking you to do a lot of little things that don’t seem necessary.

This would be “jumping through hoops” – having to f ulfill or go through a lot of different requirements in order to get what you wan t. A “hoop” is a circular piece of metal or wood that can be used for lots of diffe rent things. We have what’s called a “basketball hoop,” which is the place wher e you throw the ball through – it’s the round circle that the basketball has to go  through in order to score a point. I’m guessing this phrase comes from the activity th at you might see at a circus, for example, where they have dogs or other small an imals that jump through the circle. They have to jump through these hoops as pa rt of the activity that is supposed to be entertaining, I guess. That’s just a  guess. I’m not sure if that’s exactly where we get this expression, but that woul d make sense. The important thing is that it refers to having to do a lot of sm all, often seemingly unnecessary things in order to get what you want.

Jogi is talking about jumping through the hoops of the government’s bureaucracy. This has him “pulling his hair out.” “ To pull your hair out” means to be very frustrated, to be very annoyed. You’re so f rustrated, you’re so mad at a certain situation, that you pull on the hair of you r head with your hand so hard that you pull it out.

Of course, you’re not actually pulling out your hai r, although I used to teach high school here in the United States – high school stud ents between the ages of 14 and 18 – and I used to have a lot of hair, and now if you see a photograph of me, or a video, you will see that I don’t have any hair . That’s because teaching high school caused me to pull my hair out, it was so fru strating. That’s not true. I like teaching high school, for a while.

In our episode, Jogi doesn’t like having to jump th rough the hoops of the government’s bureaucracy. Deborah says, “What’s wro ng now?” Jogi says, “You know that all of our documents have to be submitted  in triplicate.” “Triplicate”

(triplicate) means three copies of the document. “T ri-” as a prefix means three. So, three copies of every document have to be submi tted to the government.

Jogi says, “I anticipated that and had done everyth ing to the letter, or so I thought.” Jogi says he “anticipated that.” He knew that was going to happen, and so he had a plan for it. He thought he had “done ev erything to the letter.” “To the letter” here means exactly, precisely, the exact wa y the government wanted him to do it. But at the end of the sentence he says, “ So I thought,” meaning that’s what I thought, but obviously that isn’t true.

Deborah says, “I know. I helped you prepare those d ocuments. What’s the problem?” Jogi says, “The documents were sent back to us” – were returned to us – “because they,” meaning the government, “they say we didn’t follow some of the reporting regulations” – some of the rules – “b ut the verbiage in the regulations is so convoluted that I had to interpre t them to the best of my ability.”

“Verbiage” (verbiage) refers to a lot of words, too  many words, that are often confusing or unclear. It’s a negative way of descri bing, in this case, some sort of official document that has lots of different langua ge that doesn’t make a lot of sense. This is something you will often see in a le gal document. That’s why we have lawyers – so that they can charge you a lot of  money to tell you what it means.

In the case of Jogi, the regulations are, according  to him, “convoluted,” or at least the language that the regulations are expressed in is convoluted. “Convoluted” (convoluted) means very complicated, very complex, very difficult to understand. Jogi is trying to interpret, trying to understand, these regulations to the best of his ability. If you say you do something “to the best of your ability,” you mean you’re doing it as best as you can, as well as you can.

Deborah says, “Didn’t they tell you what they thoug ht was done wrong when they returned the documents?” That is, didn’t the govern ment say where you did this wrong and this wrong and this wrong? Jogi says, “Al l I got” – the only thing I received – “was a form letter with no specifics.” A  “form (form) letter” is a letter that is written usually by a government agency or a  large company that is sent to a lot of different people with a similar problem. I t’s not specifically written for you. It’s a letter they use for lots of different people  who have whatever problem you have.

Deborah says, “I suggest calling the office respons ible for reviewing,” or looking at, “the documents and asking someone there.” Debor ah says well, just call them up. Of course, that doesn’t often work with the gov ernment. Jogi says, “You don’t

think I tried?” meaning I’ve already tried that. I’ ve already done that, of course. Jogi says, “Each time I think I have the right” – t he correct – “department and leave a voicemail message, either I don’t hear back  or I get palmed off on another office.”

Jogi calls what he thinks is the correct office. He  leaves a message, but then he doesn’t hear back. “To hear back” means to receive a response from your message – either your email or your telephone messa ge. The phrase “to be palmed (palmed) off” means that you are passed to a nother person or department. For example, if you go and ask someone a question in a government office and the person says to you, “Oh n o, you have to go to that office,” you’re being “palmed off.” You’re being ha nded to another department.

One of the meanings of this expression is that the person with whom you speak originally doesn’t really want to deal with you, do esn’t want to handle the problem, so they’re going to give you to someone el se because they don’t want to do the work. That could be one reason why you are “palmed off.” “Palm” (palm) is the part of your hand that is between you r wrist and your fingers – the inside part of your hand.

Jogi says, “I can’t get a straight answer to any of  my questions.” A “straight (straight) answer” is a clear, direct, honest answe r. Jogi can’t get a straight answer to any of his questions. He then says, “I ne ver expected this much red tape.” The expression “red tape” means a lot of rul es and regulations that have to be followed that are required by usually a governme nt organization. These are often considered unnecessary or even silly regulati ons that you have to follow, rules that somebody created that don’t really have any good purpose.

Deborah says, “So, I see what you mean about that t wo-edged sword.” Deborah is saying that she understands why Jogi described h is government contract as a “two-edged sword,” with pluses and minuses. Jogi sa ys, “I can think of one good use for that sword right now – to put me out of my misery.”

Remember we said a sword is basically a weapon that  you can use to cut or kill someone. The expression “to put someone out of his misery” (misery) means to kill someone as an act of kindness, someone who’s s uffering. If you have a dog that’s very sick, you might want to put the dog out  of its misery. “Misery” is suffering, is pain, so you’re trying to stop the do g from suffering.

Here, of course, Jogi is joking. He doesn’t really want to kill himself. He just wants to no longer suffer the pain of dealing with a bureaucracy.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jogi: I knew when we got this government contract t hat it would be a two-edged sword.

Deborah: How so?

Jogi: I’m grateful for the work, but having to jump  through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out .

Deborah: What’s wrong now?

Jogi: You know that all of our documents have to be  submitted in triplicate. I anticipated that and had done everything to the let ter, or so I thought.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Irma and Bert about being rescued – about people who get caught, trappe d, in some place and need to have someone else to come and save them. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Irma: Do you really think we’ll be rescued? It’s be en six hours and I’m losing hope.

Bert: It’s hard to say. I’m sure search and rescue teams are looking for us as we speak.

Irma: But what if they don’t come in time? We didn’ t bring any provisions and we’re almost out of water.

Bert: You’re afraid of starvation and dying of thir st? I think we’d die from hypothermia or exposure to the elements first.

Irma: Thanks. I hadn’t thought of that until you me ntioned it. Hey, I think that’s the sound of a helicopter.

Bert: You’re hearing things. That’s not a helicopte r.

Irma: I think I hear search and rescue dogs. I thin k they’re onto our scent!

Bert: I think you’re starting to hallucinate. I don ’t hear anything.

Irma: Can’t you just humor me? I’m trying to keep h ope alive.

 Bert: Oh, sure. Hey, I think I hear something.

Irma: You do?

Bert: Yeah, it’s Santa Claus on his sleigh.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Irma saying to Bert, “Do y ou really think we’ll be rescued?” “To be rescued” means to be saved from a difficult or dangerous situation. Irma says, “It’s been six hours and I’m losing hope.” “To lose hope” (hope) means to no longer believe something is poss ible. Irma doesn’t think that she and Bert will be rescued. Bert says, “It’s hard  to say,” meaning I’m not sure.

“I’m sure,” he says, “search and rescue teams are l ooking for us as we speak.” “Search and rescue (rescue) teams” are groups of pe ople that go out and try to find missing people, usually providing medical assi stance and transportation so those people can get back to “safety,” we might say .

Irma says, “But what if they don’t come in time?” “ In time” means while it is still useful – before something bad happens or before som e specific deadline. “I need to get my application in to the office in time” – b efore the deadline – “so that I’m able to apply for this job” (or whatever it is that  I’m submitting an application for). Irma is worried that the search and rescue teams wi ll not arrive in time. We’re guessing that means before Irma and Bert die from t his dangerous situation in which they find themselves.

Irma says, “We didn’t bring any provisions and we’r e almost out of water.” “Provisions” (provisions) usually refers to food th at you eat on a long journey, on a long trip. I suppose provisions could include oth er things as well, but usually it refers to food that you bring with you on a trip, e specially when you are going somewhere where there isn’t any food for you to buy  or to get easily.

Bert says, “You’re afraid of starvation and dying f rom thirst?” “Starvation” (starvation) is when you die because you don’t have  enough food. This a pretty happy dialogue, isn’t it? Yeah! We have starvation and dying of thirst. “To die of thirst” (thirst) is to die because you don’t have e nough water. “Starvation,” then, refers to not having enough food, and dying of thir st would mean to die because you don’t have any liquid, any water.

Bert says, “I think we’d die from hypothermia or ex posure to the elements first.” “Hypothermia” (hypothermia) is a medical condition of having a very low body temperature. If you’re out in the cold for a very l ong time and your body temperature begins to fall – begins to drop, begins  to go down – that could eventually kill you.

“Exposure (exposure) to the elements” refers to bei ng harmed by and possibly even dying from the conditions of the weather in a very hot, or very cold, or very wet, or very dry place when you don’t have any clot hing to protect you, or you don’t have the appropriate protection against those  “elements” or parts of the weather. So if it is a very hot area and you don’t have anywhere to go to keep you cool, you could be hurt by that. You could beco me sick or you could even die. That’s what “exposure to the elements” is refe rring to.

Irma says, “Thanks, I hadn’t thought of that until you mentioned it.” She’s not really thanking Bert. She’s telling Bert that he ha s told her something even worse than what Irma had thought of in terms of what migh t happen if the search and rescue teams don’t arrive in time.

Irma says, “Hey, I think that’s the sound of a heli copter.” A “helicopter” (helicopter) is like a plane in that it flies in the air, but unlike a plane, it can go up and down – straight up and straight down. Helicopte rs have things on top called “propellers” that go around that allow it to go up and down in the air.

Irma thinks she hears the sound of a helicopter, bu t Bert says, “You’re hearing things.” If you say “I’m hearing things” or “You’re  hearing things,” you mean that you think you hear a sound, but it’s not actually r eal. You’re hearing things that aren’t really there. If you’re a little crazy, you might hear things, and that is sometimes used almost as a joke – when someone says , “I hear something” and the other persons says, “Oh, you’re hearing things, ” meaning you’re imagining it; it’s not really true.

“That’s not a helicopter,” Bert says. But Irma says , “I think I hear search and rescue dogs.” These would be dogs that are sent out  to find someone who has gone missing. She says, “I think they’re onto our s cent.” “To be onto” something means to be aware of something, to be following it,  to be investigating it. “Scent” (scent) is a way that something or someone smells. That is, of course, how dogs find things or people that are missing. They have t he scent of that person, and then they can use their power of smell to find the person.

Bert says, “I think you’re starting to hallucinate. ” “To hallucinate” (hallucinate) means that you see or experience something that isn ’t really there. This

sometimes happens when people take certain kinds of  drugs, but it can also happen if you, for example, haven’t had enough to d rink – your mind can start to go a little crazy. Bert thinks Irma is hallucinatin g. He says, “I don’t hear anything.”

Irma says, “Can’t you just humor me?” “To humor” (h umor) someone is to go along with someone’s idea or perhaps even some joke  that someone is telling – to pretend that you agree with this person even tho ugh you don’t really agree with them or even though you don’t really think tha t his idea is something that is a good one. To humor someone would be to pretend that  you agree or pretend that whatever they are saying is true.

Irma says “Can’t you just humor me? I’m trying to k eep hope alive.” “To keep hope alive” means to continue to be positive, to co ntinue to be optimistic even when bad things are happening, even when perhaps th ere is no good reason for you to be hopeful about the future. Bert says, “Oh,  sure. Hey, I think I hear something.” Now Bert thinks he hears something. Irm a says, “You do?”

Then Burt responds, “Yeah, it’s Santa Claus on his sleigh.” He’s actually joking. He says he hears something, and when Irma asks him what, he responds “Santa Claus on his sleigh.” Santa Claus is, of course, the symbol of Christmas, and in the popular belief – at least among children – Sant a Claus delivers presents, gifts, to them every Christmas.

How does Santa Claus do this? Well he rides through  the sky, not in a helicopter – though that would seem like a good idea – but in a “sleigh” (sleigh). A “sleigh” is another word for a large “sled” (sled). What’s a  sled? A “sleigh” or a “sled” is something that moves over the snow and ice, usually  pulled by an animal such as horse or perhaps even a reindeer. Sleighs are la rge sleds that people travel in, in cold places.

It’s not something really that you see very much of  anymore. Usually it’s just done for entertainment nowadays, although there are  still, in some places of the world, people who travel by sleigh because that’s t he most efficient way of getting across snow or ice when you don’t have a he licopter.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Irma: Do you really think we’ll be rescued? It’s be en six hours and I’m losing hope.

Bert: It’s hard to say. I’m sure search and rescue teams are looking for us as we speak.

Irma: But what if they don’t come in time? We didn’ t bring any provisions and we’re almost out of water.

Bert: You’re afraid of starvation and dying of thir st? I think we’d die from hypothermia or exposure to the elements first.

# Being Diagnosed With and Treated For Cancer

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,042 – Being Diagnosed with and Treated for Cancer.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,042. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Vivian and Guy ( notice Guy can be a man’s name as well as a general term for a man) about the  all-too-common problem of cancer. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vivian: Do you see this lump? I’m sure I have cance r.

Guy: Don’t jump to conclusions. It could be somethi ng completely benign.

Vivian: I know it’s not benign. It’s got to be a ma lignant tumor. The cancer is probably at stage two or three already. The oncolog ist will probably want to start me on radiation and chemotherapy right away.

Guy: You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and you’r e already planning for the worst.

Vivian: Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepa red for the bad news. The doctor will do a biopsy, but I already know what the results will be. I’m just hoping the prognosis will be good.

Guy: I think you’re getting way ahead of yourself. It could be something completely harmless.

Vivian: I can’t afford to believe that. I have a fa mily history of cancer. My father was diagnosed when he was 56 years old. It’s true h e’s been in remission and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with c ancer.

Guy: That’s right, you never know. You could live t o the age of 90.

Vivian: You can fool yourself as much as you like, but I have to face facts – especially as sick as I am.

[end of dialogue]

Vivian begins our dialogue by asking Guy, “Do you s ee this lump? I’m sure I have cancer.” A “lump” (lump) is a small bump or piece of something that, when we’re talking about the body, is right below your skin. T here’s something like a little ball underneath your skin that you can feel – that’s a “ lump.” “Cancer” (cancer) is a disease caused when cells in some part of your body  begin to grow and make you sick. “Cancer” can, of course, kill you, and un happily does in some cases.

Guy says to Vivian, “Don’t jump to conclusions.” Vi vian thinks that she has cancer just because she found a lump on her body. “ To jump to conclusions” means to think that you know the answer to a questi on before you have all the information necessary to know the answer. “To jump to conclusions” is to try to make a decision or reach a conclusion before having  all of the necessary information.

Guy says, “It,” meaning the lump, “could be somethi ng completely benign.” A “benign” (benign) lump would be a lump that would n ot be harmful or deadly. The word “benign” means that it doesn’t cause any harm,  that it won’t hurt you. Vivian, however, says, “I know it’s not benign. It’ s got to be a malignant tumor.” The word “malignant” (malignant) here means the opp osite of benign – something that will hurt you. A “tumor” (tumor) is a kind of cancer growth that can spread throughout your body and ultimately kill you .

Vivian says, “The cancer is probably at stage two o r stage three already.” Cancers are often classified by how serious they ar e, or how advanced they are – how much the cancer has spread throughout your bo dy. The classification system is based on stages. A “stage” (stage) here m eans one step in a process, one level of progress or advancement of a certain t hing – in this case, the growth of the cancer.

The higher the number of the stage, the more advanc ed and serious the cancer has become. Stage one is not as serious as stage fo ur, which I believe is the highest stage used when talking about the spread of  cancer, the growth of the cancerous cells in your body. Vivian thinks she’s a lready at stage two or three, which would be somewhat unusual, but possible. “The  oncologist,” she says, “will probably want to start me on radiation and chemothe rapy right away.”

 Vivian doesn’t even know if she has cancer and she’ s already assuming all sorts of things such as that her cancer is already at sta ge two or three. She also thinks the oncologist will start her on radiation and chem otherapy. An “oncologist” (oncologist) is a doctor who specializes in diagnos ing and treating cancer. “To diagnose” (diagnose) means to identify a problem, u sually a medical problem that you have. An oncologist can determine if you h ave cancer and treat the cancer. “To treat” cancer means to try to stop the cancer to cure you.

Vivian mentions “radiation” and “chemotherapy.” “Ra diation” (radiation) is the use of high energy that kills cancer cells and makes the tumors smaller. It’s a medical treatment. “Chemotherapy” (chemotherapy) is the use  of injections of chemicals, chemicals that are put into your body to kill the c ancer cells.

Guy says, “You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and  you’re already planning for the worst.” Guy is saying you haven’t even talked t o one doctor and you already are “planning for the worst” – the worst possible c ase. Vivian says, “Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepared for the bad news .” “To be mentally prepared” means that you think about a problem and are ready for the worst possible case of that problem or worst possible resolution of tha t problem, perhaps.

Vivian says, “The doctor will do a biopsy, but I al ready know what the results will be.” A “biopsy” (biopsy) is a medical procedure whe re a small amount of your body is removed and tested – in this case, it would  be tested to see if you had cancer. Vivian says, “I’m just hoping the prognosis  will be good.” “Prognosis” (prognosis) is what a doctor thinks will happen to you with a certain disease. “Diagnosis” means the doctor identifies the problem . A “prognosis” is what the doctor thinks will happen to you. Will you continue  to live for the next 10 years? Will you die in six months? Those would be examples  of prognoses. It’s a prediction about what will happen to you in terms of your health.

Guy says, “I think you’re getting way ahead of your self.” “To get ahead of yourself” or “way ahead of yourself” means to say o r do something sooner than you should, especially if you have jumped to conclu sions – if you have made up your mind before you have all the information that you need to make a decision. You can also get way ahead of yourself by making pr eparations for something that hasn’t even happened yet.

So for example, you meet a beautiful girl at a bar and you get her phone number. You go home and you start planning your wedding wit h this woman. You start thinking about how many children you want to have w ith this woman. That would be a very good example of getting way ahead of your self. Notice the use of the

word “way” (way) here. It just means “very much” – really ahead of yourself, perhaps.

Guy says, “It” – meaning again the lump – “could be  something completely harmless.” Vivian responds, “I can’t afford to beli eve that.” If someone says they “can’t afford (afford) to” do something, the person  means it’s not possible for them, because if they did, it would cause them more  harm. The risk of something bad happening is too great.

Vivian says, “I have a family history of cancer.” A  “family history” of some disease or illness means that other members of your family have had that disease. In my case, I have a family history of heart disease. My father had heart disease, as did some of my uncles. Vivian says, “My father was diag nosed when he was 56 years old.” “My father was diagnosed” – meaning the  doctors said that he had cancer – when he was only 56. “It’s true,” Vivian continues, “he’s been in remiss ion and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with cancer.”

If your cancer is “in remission” (remission), your cancer seems to have stopped or gotten better or possibly even disappeared. If y our cancer is in remission, you’re healthy, at least for now. Vivian says her f ather has been in remission from his cancer and hasn’t had a “relapse” yet. A “ relapse” (relapse) is a return to a previous state or condition of bad health. So, yo u get better and then you get worse again. Getting worse again would be the relap se, going back to the condition you started with.

Guy says, “That’s right, you never know.” Vivian ha s said that, quote, “You never know with cancer.” When someone says “you never kno w,” he means it is not possible for you to predict. Guy says, “That’s righ t, you could live to the age of 90.” Vivian says, “You can fool yourself as much as  you like, but I have to face facts.” “To fool (fool) yourself” means to make you  believe something that isn’t true – to hide the truth from yourself.

Vivian says she has to face facts. The expression “ to face (face) facts (facts)” means to accept reality, to accept the truth, espec ially when it’s a difficult or painful truth that you have to accept. Vivian is co nvinced that she has cancer, and that’s why she ends by saying that she has to f ace facts, “especially as sick as I am.” Vivian believes she’s sick even though sh e hasn’t gone to a doctor yet.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Vivian: Do you see this lump? I’m sure I have cance r.

Guy: Don’t jump to conclusions. It could be somethi ng completely benign.

Vivian: I know it’s not benign. It’s got to be a ma lignant tumor. The cancer is probably at stage two or three already. The oncolog ist will probably want to start me on radiation and chemotherapy right away.

Guy: You haven’t seen a single doctor yet and you’r e already planning for the worst.

Vivian: Of course I am. I want to be mentally prepa red for the bad news. The doctor will do a biopsy, but I already know what the results will be. I’m just hoping the prognosis will be good.

Guy: I think you’re getting way ahead of yourself. It could be something completely harmless.

Vivian: I can’t afford to believe that. I have a fa mily history of cancer. My father was diagnosed when he was 56 years old. It’s true h e’s been in remission and hasn’t had a relapse yet, but you never know with c ancer.

Guy: That’s right, you never know. You could live t o the age of 90.

Vivian: You can fool yourself as much as you like, but I have to face facts – especially as sick as I am.

This episode is a dialogue between Mo and Amy about  television programs. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mo: I have some bad news: Your favorite TV show has  been cancelled.

Amy: I’m not surprised. Ratings plummeted last seas on, so the writing was on the wall.

Mo: Also on the chopping block is your favorite rea lity show: American Idiots .

Amy: Oh no, not American Idiots , too! I thought it was gaining ground in the ratings after a slow start.

Mo: Unfortunately, it stayed a cult favorite and ne ver garnered a large enough viewership to be renewed.

Amy: I’ll have nothing to watch next season.

Mo: You can watch some of my shows. All of my favor ites are being renewed, with one taking a short hiatus.

Amy: A short hiatus? We all know what that means.

Mo: What are you implying?

Amy: The network will put in a mid-season replaceme nt, and if it does well, you’ll never see your show again.

Mo: That’s not true. You’re just saying that becaus e your shows got the ax.

Amy: No, I’m not. That show is on its last legs. Ma rk my words.

Mo: Well, even if it’s true, I still have something  to watch, for now.

Amy: What are you watching right now?

Mo: A show called Podsters . It’s a reality show where a bunch of podcasters l ive in a house together and are watched 24 hours a day.

Amy: I’ve never heard of anything so inane. Who car es about the lives of podcasters? They must be the most boring people in the world.

Mo: You might have a point there.

[end of dialogue]

Mo says to Amy, “I have some bad news: Your favorit e TV show has been cancelled.” If a TV show is “cancelled,” it is no l onger going to continue to be on television. “To be cancelled” in general means to h ave something ended. It is no longer continued. Mo says that Amy’s favorite TV sh ow has been cancelled.

Amy says, “I’m not surprised. Ratings plummeted las t season, so the writing was on the wall.” “Ratings” (ratings) refer to how popu lar something is. When we talk about the ratings of a TV show, we are referring to  the number of people who are watching the show. If ratings “plummet” (plummet), they go down, or decrease, significantly – fewer and fewer people are watching  the show. Amy says the ratings for her favorite show plummeted this last s eason.

A “season” (season) is a period of time that occurs  during the year and repeats the next year and the year after that. We could tal k about the “baseball season,” which begins in April and ends in October or early November. The television season in the United States usually begins in the f all in September and continues to the spring, usually May or June of the following  year.

During the summer, then, there aren’t as many new p rograms, although nowadays there are new programs all the time throug hout the year, but traditionally we talk about the television season a s the time in which a show is

being shown on television – when you can watch it o n television. The normal TV season was always September to June, but now things  have changed and there are lots of different seasons.

We also use this word “season” to refer to a set of  programs that go together. Many TV shows, for example, have three, four, five,  perhaps even six seasons, and each season includes maybe 15 or 20 episodes, 1 5 or 20 individual shows. Amy uses the expression “the writing was on the wal l.” “The writing was on the wall” is a phrase meaning that it was clear or obvi ous that something was going to happen – that nobody should be surprised by it, that all the indications were that this would happen.

Mo says, “Also on the chopping block is your favori te reality show, American Idiots .” “To be on the chopping (chopping) block (block)”  means to be in danger of being cancelled or ended. If someone says, “My j ob is on the chopping block,” he means that his job may be eliminated and he may be fired; he may lose his job.

Anything can be on the chopping block. “To chop” me ans to cut. A “chopping block” would be a place where, for example, a butch er – someone who cuts meat – would cut the meat. It would also be a place wher e you might kill an animal. So, to be on the chopping block means to be in danger of being not killed, but cancelled or perhaps fired, even.

Amy’s favorite reality TV show is on the chopping b lock. A “reality TV show” is a TV show in which supposedly people aren’t acting, t hat it’s supposed to be real life, although usually it isn’t. Amy’s favorite TV show, reality TV show, is American Idiots , which is not a real show (but it could be and pro bably will be, someday). An “idiot” (idiot) is a stupid person, a dumb person.

Amy says, “Oh no, not American Idiots , too! I thought it,” meaning the show, “was gaining ground in the ratings.” “To gain (gain) gro und” means to improve slowly – to get better, to increase. Amy thought the show wa s becoming more popular, that more people were watching it.

Mo says, “Unfortunately, it stayed a cult favorite and never garnered a large enough viewership to be renewed.” A “cult (cult) fa vorite” is a show that is very popular among a small group of people. The average person doesn’t like the show, but a small group of people do, and that ofte n is enough to keep a television show going. However, that was not the ca se for Amy’s TV show. The show “never garnered a large enough viewership.”

“To garner” (garner) means to gather or receive or collect. “I’m garnering donations for my favorite charity” – I’m getting mo ney to give to an organization that does good things. This television show did not  garner a large enough viewership. The word “viewership” just refers to the number of people who watch the show, or to the people who watch the show. “To garner a large enough viewership” would be to get enough people watching the television program.

This show didn’t do that, at least not enough to be  renewed. If a television show is “renewed” (renewed), it is continued into the ne xt year or the next season. So, if it is a popular show, the people who make the sh ow and the television channels that broadcast the show will continue it. They’ll continue producing that program. “To be renewed” is the opposite of “to be cancelled.” Mo says that this television show that Amy likes, American Idiots , was not renewed.

Amy says, “I’ll have nothing to watch next season.”  “Next season” refers to, probably in this case, the following fall and sprin g. Mo says, “You can watch some of my shows” – my favorite shows. “All of my f avorites are being renewed, with one taking a short hiatus.” A “hiatus” (hiatus ) is a short break. When a show takes a hiatus, it is not cancelled, but it is stop ping production for a short amount of time, but it will be continuing again in a few m onths or perhaps next year.

Amy says, “A short hiatus? We all know what that me ans.” The expression “we all know what that means” is used to indicate that everyone understands the real meaning of it that isn’t what is being told to you.  There’s some other meaning involved. Mo, however, says, “What are you implying ?” “To imply” (imply) means to say something indirectly – to speak in a way tha t isn’t direct that is communicating the message, but not saying it explic itly.

Amy says “The network,” the television network, “wi ll put in a midseason replacement, and if it does well, you’ll never see your show again.” Sometimes what happens is during the middle of the year, if a  television show perhaps isn’t doing very well, the television channels will put i n a different show, what’s called a “midseason replacement.” “Mid” (mid) means “in the middle of.”

So, in the middle of the regular September to June television season, the television network – the group of television channe ls that all show the same shows – will put in another show and say that this first show is “on hiatus.” It’s on a break. But if the replacement show does better th an the original show, they’ll often cancel the original show, and you’ll never se e it again.

Mo says, “That’s not true. You’re just saying that because your shows got the ax.” “To get the ax” (ax) means to be cancelled or to be fired. “My friend got the

ax at work,” at his company. He got fired. Amy says , “No, I’m not,” meaning I’m not saying that just because my shows were cancelle d.

Amy says, “That show is on its last legs.” We’re no t sure which show Amy is talking about, since Mo mentioned that all of his f avorites were being renewed, so apparently Mo and Amy understand which show she’ s referring to. Amy says, “That show is on its last legs.” If you are “on you r last legs” (legs), you’re very tired and might even die soon. If we say a televisi on show is on its last legs, we mean it probably will be cancelled soon. It’s about  to die, if you will.

Amy says, “Mark my words.” That expression “mark (m ark) my words” is used to get someone to pay attention to what you are saying , especially when it refers to a prediction – what might happen in the future. “Ma rk my words, the Dodgers will win the World Series this year.” Well, I hope! The World Series is the U.S. championship for professional baseball. Amy is tell ing Mo to mark her words, that this show will be cancelled, whatever show they’re talking about.

Mo says, “Well, even if it’s true, I still have som ething to watch for now.” Amy says, “What are you watching right now?” at this mi nute. Mo says, “A show called Podsters . It’s a reality show where a bunch of podcasters l ive in a house together and are watched 24 hours a day.” There is no show c alled Podsters  in the U.S., but there are shows in which people are put on came ra for the entire day and the TV shows show them during parts of the day. Big Bro ther  is an example of a show like that. But Mo is watching a show in our di alogue called Podsters .

Amy says, “I’ve never heard of anything so inane.” If something is “inane” (inane), it’s stupid. It’s foolish. It’s silly. Amy  thinks that a show about podcasters is inane. Mo says, “You might have a point there.” If you say to someone, “You might have a point there,” you mean that the other person may be right; maybe what the other person is saying is true. Mo, then, is agreeing with Amy that a show called Podsters  is, indeed, inane.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mo: I have some bad news: Your favorite TV show has  been cancelled.

Amy: I’m not surprised. Ratings plummeted last seas on, so the writing was on the wall.

Mo: Also on the chopping block is your favorite rea lity show: American Idiots .

 Amy: Oh no, not American Idiots , too! I thought it was gaining ground in the ratings after a low start.

Mo: Unfortunately, it stayed a cult favorite and ne ver garnered a large enough viewership to be renewed.

Amy: I’ll have nothing to watch next season.

Mo: You can watch some of my shows. All of my favor ites are being renewed, with one taking a short hiatus.

Amy: A short hiatus? We all know that that means.

Mo: What are you implying?

Amy: The network will put in a mid-season replaceme nt, and if it does well, you’ll never see your show again.

Mo: That’s not true. You’re just saying that becaus e your shows got the ax.

Amy: No, I’m not. That show is on its last legs. Ma rk my words.

Mo: Well, even if it’s true, I still have something  to watch, for now.

Amy: I’ve never heard or anything so inane. Who car es about the lives of podcasters? They must be the most boring people in the world.

Mo: You might have a point there.

There’s nothing inane about the wonderful scripts w ritten by our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. She won’t be getting the ax anytime soon, I’m sure.



# Issuing a Public Apology

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,044 – Issuing a Public Apology.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,044. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a story about someone who has to ap ologize for something he has done wrong. Let’s get started. > Working in public relations, I often have to deal w ith my clients’ gaffes and blunders. My job is to calm any firestorm before it  gets out of hand.
> One of the most important things to do whenever the re’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology. An apology should say plain ly and clearly that the individual or company is sorry and that it takes re sponsibility for its actions. If possible, the apology should outline corrective act ions that will be taken. The key is to come clean, apologize, and take the blame, an d to do so quickly and without hesitation.
> I give my clients this advice every time they land themselves in a mess, but do they listen to me? The smarts ones do.
> And the others? Many of them are still trying to sa lvage their reputations and to bounce back. And me? I try very hard not to say “I told you so.”

This episode is all about apologies. An “apology” ( apology) is when you say that you have done something wrong. Often, an apology is  asking for the forgiveness of the person or people that you have harmed or inj ured. We apologize for things we do wrong – at least, we should, but not everybod y does.

In our story, the person is involved or working in public relations. “Public relations” (relations) refers to an area of work, a  professional field where people try to improve how companies and individuals are se en by the general public. “Public relations” is involved in protecting the re putation and the image of a company or of an individual.

“Working in public relations,” I say, “I often have  to deal with my clients’ gaffes and blunders.” A “gaffe” (gaffe) is a small mistake , especially when you have said something that is wrong or perhaps have hurt someon e. A “blunder” (blunder) is a small mistake or error – usually some action that  has been taken. A gaffe is usually something that someone has said. A blunder is often something that someone has done, although you could use “blunder” for something that you said, as well. A blunder often causes you embarrass ment and requires that you apologize.

“My job,” according to the story, “is to calm any f irestorm before it gets out of hand.” A “firestorm” (firestorm) is a major problem , something that attracts a lot of negative attention, a lot of criticism. The word “f irestorm” is used often in business to talk about a big problem, or in politic s to talk about some controversy – something that happened that everyone is talking about and that perhaps may require someone to apologize for.

The expression “to get out of hand” means to become  out of control. It refers to a problem that has become so big that it is impossibl e to solve it. We sometimes say that a situation is “getting out of hand,” mean ing the situation is getting worse and we won’t be able to control it or fix it if we allow it to continue to grow, to continue to get bigger.

The job of the public relations department in a com pany is to “calm any firestorm before it gets out of hand.” “To calm” (calm) means  to stop or to end or to make less serious. “To calm a firestorm” would be to tak e a situation where there’s a lot of negative publicity, a lot of negative reaction, and try to end that negative reaction by doing something to stop the situation f rom getting out of hand, from growing and becoming worse.

I continue by saying, “One of the most important th ings to do whenever there’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology.” A “mi sstep” (misstep) – one word – is a mistake. It’s an error. It’s something that yo u did or said that was wrong. Usually a “misstep” is not a serious situation, but  it could be.

A “public apology” is when you make a statement and  you send it to the newspapers and to the magazines and to the televisi on stations so that

everybody knows that you’re apologizing. A “private  apology” would be when you say you’re sorry to someone individually, without o ther people knowing about it, or at least without the newspapers reporting it.

“An apology should say plainly and clearly that the  individual or company is sorry,” I say. “Plainly” (plainly) means the same a s clearly. “To say something plainly” is to be very direct, to be very explicit,  without any sort of hidden message. “Plainly” and “clearly,” then, really mean  the same thing here.

The apology should say that the individual or the c ompany is sorry. “To be sorry” means that you feel badly about what you have done.  You regret something you have done. I also say that when a company apologize s, it should take responsibility for its actions. “To take responsibi lity for” something is to say that you are the person who caused this to happen or you  are the person to blame if something goes wrong related to this particular act ion or situation. When you take responsibility for something, you say “I am the person to blame. If there is a problem, it’s my fault.”

I continue, “If possible, the apology should outlin e corrective actions that will be taken.” The word “corrective” (corrective) comes fr om the word “correct,” which means to change or fix the situation so that this i s working better or that it is the way it should be. “Corrective actions” would be thi ngs that a company does to fix the problem that it has caused.

“The key,” I continue, “is to come clean, apologize , and take the blame.” The phrasal verb “to come clean” means to admit that yo u’ve done something wrong – not to hide the fact that you made a mistake. “To  take the blame” (blame) means the same as to accept responsibility or to ta ke responsibility for something that has gone wrong.

So, according to our story, when a company makes a mistake, it should “come clean, apologize, and take the blame,” and it shoul d do so “quickly and without hesitation.” “Hesitation” is when you pause or dela y before doing something. The verb is “to hesitate” (hesitate). “To hesitate” is to stop and not do something, or to pause before you do something. The story says you s hould not hesitate if you’ve made a mistake, but instead you should apologize ri ght away.

“I give my clients,” I continue, “this advice every  time they land themselves in a mess.” Your “clients” are the people for whom you d o work. “To land yourself in a mess” (mess) means to do something that creates a d ifficult situation for yourself – to do something that causes problems. If you land  yourself in a mess at work, you’ve done something that has caused problems for you and perhaps might

even hurt your chances of continuing to work at the  company. So, it’s a major problem.

The word “mess” is often used to describe a large o r difficult or complex problem that someone has caused or created. In the story, I  say that I give my advice to my clients every time they land themselves, or get themselves, in a mess, but the smart ones listen, and the not-so-smart ones don’t listen.

“Many of my clients,” I say, “are still trying to s alvage their reputations and to bounce back.” Your “reputation” is what other peopl e think about you – your “public image,” we might say. “To salvage” (salvage ) your reputation is to improve your reputation, especially when you have a  very bad reputation. “To salvage” anything is to take it and fix it and make  it better so that you can continue using it.

“To salvage a reputation” would be to take a negati ve or bad reputation and try to make it more positive. “To bounce back” is a two wo rd phrasal verb meaning to recover from a difficult situation, to return to a good condition after having been in a bad condition. If something goes wrong for you, i f something causes you difficulty, it’s important to bounce back to do bet ter the next time – to keep trying to improve your situation.

I say that many of my clients don’t listen to me an d I try very hard not to say “I told you so.” The phrase “I told you so” is used to  emphasize that you were correct about something. Usually we use this phrase  when you tell someone to do something and they don’t do it, and then somethi ng bad happens to them and we say, “Well, I told you so,” meaning “I told you not to do this,” or “I told you to do it and you didn’t, and now you have problems or difficulties.”

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a nativ e speed.

[start of story]

Working in public relations, I often have to deal w ith my clients’ gaffes and blunders. My job is to calm any firestorm before it  gets out of hand.

One of the most important things to do whenever the re’s been a misstep is to issue a public apology. An apology should say plain ly and clearly that the individual or company is sorry and that it takes re sponsibility for its actions. If possible, the apology should outline corrective act ions that will be taken. The key is to come clean, apologize, and take the blame, an d to do so quickly and without hesitation.

 I give my clients this advice every time they land themselves in a mess, but do they listen to me? The smarts ones do.

And the others? Many of them are still trying to sa lvage their reputations and to bounce back. And me? I try very hard not to say, “I  told you so.”

[end of story]

There are no gaffes or blunders in our wonderful sc ripts. That’s because they’re written by our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse .



# Being Infatuated With Someone

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 1,045 – Being Infatuated with Someone.

This episode is a dialogue between Marcel and Fiona  about someone who is infatuated with another person. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcel: What is this on your wall?

Fiona: It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite p layer.

Marcel: This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!

Fiona: It’s not a shrine. I just have a few picture s of him taped on my wall.

Marcel: You have poster-size pictures of him coveri ng three walls of your room. This goes beyond being a fan. You’re obsessed with him.

Fiona: No, I’m not obsessed. I admit that I’m a lit tle infatuated with him, but it’s a healthy kind of adulation.

Marcel: You’ve definitely gotten carried away.

Fiona: Just a little. I’m devoted to watching him p lay in every game and I try to find out as much as I can about him, but it’s becau se I admire him. It’s not like I’m stalking him or something.

Marcel: Then why do you have all of this equipment?

Fiona: That’s in case there’s a sighting of him in this city.

 Marcel: A sighting?

Fiona: Yes, there’s a network of fans that keeps ta bs on him, and if I learn that he’s in town, I can try to get a photo with him.

Marcel: And what are those handcuffs for?

Fiona: I only have those in case he doesn’t coopera te.

Marcel: You’re right. Your infatuation is completel y healthy!

[end of dialogue]

Marcel begins our dialogue by asking Fiona, “What i s this on your wall?” Fiona has something hanging on her wall, something attach ed to her wall. Fiona says, “It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite player.  Del Gordon appears to be an athlete of some sort. Fiona says it’s her “tribute to Del Gordon.” A “tribute” is something that you do or say that shows that you ho nor and respect another person. It could be a speech that you give to a gro up of people. It could be a party that you have in honor of this person. In the  case of Fiona, it’s something that she has on her wall.

Marcel says, “This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!”  A “shrine” (shrine) is normally considered a holy place, a place of prayer where pe ople worship God. So, to call this a “shrine” means that it is more than just a s imple little photograph or tribute of some sort – it is instead something bigger, some thing that it looks like it could be a shrine. People do sometimes have small shrines  in their homes for religious reasons, but this is not something religious; this is what we might call an “infatuation,” which I’ll define in a minute.

Fiona says, “It’s not a shrine. I just have a few p ictures of him taped on my wall.” They’re attached to her wall – probably not by tape , although they might be. Marcel says, “You have poster-size pictures of him covering three walls of your room.” A “poster” (poster) is a large piece of pape r, typically, that is used to advertise a movie or perhaps a rock band or even a sports star. People often have posters – especially young people – in their r ooms of their favorite athlete or musician or actor.

Posters can be quite large – usually two- or three- feet tall – and that’s what Marcel is referring to when he says that Fiona has “poster-size pictures,” meaning the photographs are as big as posters. “Thi s goes beyond being a fan,”

Marcel says, “You’re obsessed with him.” A “fan” (f an) is someone who likes an athlete, musician, actor, or perhaps a type of spor t or a type of music or even a podcast. (Why not?)

Marcel says that Fiona is obsessed with Del Gordon.  “To be obsessed” (obsessed) means that you are only able to think ab out one thing. The adjective is “obsessive.” Someone who is obsessive is always thinking about one thing. Sometimes this can be an indication of some sort of  mental illness. Here, it refers to Fiona’s love of this particular athlete. She’s o bsessed with this athlete. She can’t think of anything else.

Fiona says, “No, I’m not obsessed.” She disagrees w ith Marcel. She says, “I admit that I’m a little infatuated with him, but it ’s a healthy kind of adulation.” She says “I admit,” meaning I will confess or I will say something that is true, even though it isn’t something I may be proud of. She sa ys she’s a little “infatuated” with Gordon. “To be infatuated (infatuated) with” s omeone is to basically be in love with this person, but usually only for a short  time.

When you are attracted to, for example, a beautiful  woman or a handsome man, you might become infatuated with that person. You m ay think of nothing but that person and think that perhaps you are even in love with that person, even if you’ve only seen them on the street. That happens t o everyone, I suppose (not after you get married, though).

Fiona is infatuated with Del Gordon, but she says “ it’s a healthy kind of “adulation.” “Adulation” (adulation) is showing a l ot of love and admiration for someone or for something, usually to an extreme ext ent. You’re doing it too much. Marcel says, “You’ve definitely gotten carrie d away.” “To get carried away” means to do too much of something, anything.

You could get carried away with exercising. You cou ld go to the gym four hours every day – unless you’re a professional athlete, t hat’s probably getting carried away. That’s what has happened to Fiona. She’s gott en carried away with her love of Del Gordon, her favorite player. Fiona says , “Just a little,” meaning she’s only gotten a little carried away.

“I’m devoted to watching him play in every game, an d I try to find out as much as I can about him, but it’s because I admire him.” Fi ona says she’s “devoted” (devoted). “To be devoted to” something means that you are strongly committed to this person or this thing, almost with feelings of love for whatever the activity is. The activity here is watching Del Gordon play i n every game. That’s what Fiona is devoted to.

 She says that she “admires” him. “To admire” (admir e) is to think that someone or something is very good and deserves a lot of res pect. You can admire a person without being in love with them, of course, or even being infatuated with them. You can admire a politician, although I’m not  sure why you would, but you could. You could admire a leader of a company or a religious group. Lots of possibilities. Therefore, “admiration,” which is the noun that comes from the verb “to admire.”

Next Fiona says, “It’s not like I’m stalking him or  something.” “It’s not like” means this is not what I am doing. I am not stalking him.  “To stalk” (stalk) someone is to follow someone in a secret, hidden way that is usua lly considered dangerous. Perhaps you want to hurt the person. Perhaps you ev en want to kill the person.

We have stalkers of celebrities here in Los Angeles  – people who follow celebrities, famous people, around. This is, depend ing on how you do it, potentially illegal, and you could get arrested for  following someone around, especially if it seems as though you might do somet hing hurtful or damaging to that person. But Fiona says she’s not stalking Del Gordon. Marcel says, “Then why do you have all of this equipment?” We’re not s ure what equipment Marcel is referring to.

Fiona says, “That’s in case there is a sighting of him in this city.” “In case” means if something happens, in this particular situation.  A “sighting” (sighting) is when you see someone or something, often something that is very rare. Here in L.A., people talk about “star sightings” – seeing famous celebrities, famous people. Have I seen famous people here in Los Angeles? Sure . You see them at the grocery store. You see them at the mall. You see th em on the street. If you live in the city of Los Angeles, you’re going to see some f amous people eventually.

Marcel then asks, “A sighting?” Fiona says, “Yes, t here’s a network of fans that keeps tabs on him, and if I learn that he is in tow n, I can try to get a photo with him.” A “network” is a group of people who are all connected in some way and who are communicating with each other. A “network” can also refer to a group of computers that are connected to each other for some  common purpose. The phrase “to keep tabs (tabs) on” someone means to kn ow the location of someone – to know where someone is or what they are doing.

Fiona says there are people in this network of fans  who keep tabs on Del Gordon. If Fiona learns that her favorite athlete i s “in town,” meaning in the city right now, she can try to get a photo with him. Not ice we say “in town” when someone is physically present in the city where you  are. The opposite would be

“out of town.” If you are “out of town,” you are no t in the city where you are normally – the place where you live, say.

Marcel says, “And what are those handcuffs for?” “H andcuffs” (handcuffs) are two metal rings that go around your wrists. The rin gs are attached by a short chain. Police use handcuffs in order to arrest some one, to make sure the person doesn’t try to escape. Fiona has a pair of handcuff s. Why? She says, “I only have those in case he doesn’t cooperate.”

In other words, she has these handcuffs in case she  sees her favorite player and asks the favorite player for a photograph and the p layer says no. If that happens, then she can put handcuffs around him and make him take a photograph with her. Of course, this is not something you can do. I t’s illegal to do that sort of thing. And it’s also a sign that Fiona really is ob sessed with this person.

Marcel says sarcastically – jokingly – “You’re righ t. Your infatuation is completely healthy,” meaning there’s nothing wrong with this i nfatuation with this person. He means, of course, just the opposite. You can tell b y the way he says it that he’s being sarcastic. He’s joking. “Sarcasm” means sayin g one thing but meaning another in order to make a joke.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed

[start of dialogue]

Marcel: What is this on your wall?

Fiona: It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite p layer.

Marcel: This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!

Fiona: It’s not a shrine. I just have a few picture s of him taped on my wall.

Marcel: You have poster-size pictures of him coveri ng three walls of your room. This goes beyond being a fan. You’re obsessed with him.

Fiona: No, I’m not obsessed. I admit that I’m a lit tle infatuated with him, but it’s a healthy kind of adulation.

# Types of Luggage

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,046 – Types of Luggage.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,046. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about types, or kinds, of luggage – what you use to transport your clothing when you travel. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Driver: Ma’am, where would you like these suitcases ?

Leona: The three wheeled suitcases should go next t o the bed, and the garment bag should be hung up in the closet. Where is my ex pandable bag?

Driver: Do you mean this duffel bag?

Leona: Yes. You can leave that right there. Hmm, wh ere is my carry-on? All I see is my checked baggage. I thought I gave you my carr y-on, too.

Driver: You did, ma’am, and it’s right here.

Leona: Oh, good. When can I expect my trunk to arri ve?

Driver: Your trunk? You had a trunk?

Leona: Yes, I had a trunk. Didn’t you see it at the  airport?

Driver: Uh no, I must have overlooked it.

Leona: You mean you left behind my trunk?! Who know s what has become of it by now!

Driver: I’m sure I’ll be able to find it and delive r it here to you.

 Leona: I knew I should have used a luggage forwardi ng service.

Driver: You might consider traveling light next tim e, ma’am.

Leona: What did you say?!

Driver: Nothing! I’m going to fetch your trunk as w e speak.

Leona: I should hope so!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue is between a woman named Leona and her  driver. A “driver” is a person who usually drives you around in a car. You could have a driver if you’re a rich person, for example. You don’t want to drive , so you have a driver – someone who drives you from place to place.

The driver says to Leona, “Ma’am,” which is a polit e way of addressing a woman – somewhat formal, however, “where would you like t hese suitcases?” A “suitcase” is the same as a piece of luggage. It’s a container in which you put your clothing and other things that you are using, and that is used to transport those items to wherever you’re going when you trave l.

Leona says, “The three wheeled suitcases should go next to the bed.” A “wheeled (wheeled) suitcase” is a suitcase that has  – are you ready? – wheels. Yes. A wheeled suitcase has wheels on it so that yo u can roll it along the ground. Back when I was growing up, most suitcases did not have wheels on them. Instead, you bought this separate little device cal led a “luggage carrier” and you put your pieces of luggage on that. Now luggage com panies have gotten smart, and they put the wheels right on the suitcases, rig ht on the pieces of luggage.

Leona says that the wheeled suitcases should go nex t to the bed. She continues, “The garment bag should be hung up in the closet.” A “garment” (garment) is a piece of clothing. So, a “garment bag” is a special  piece of luggage that is only used typically for transporting clothing. Usually a  garment bag is long. You are able to put a suit in it or a dress in it, and then  you fold it over so that it doesn’t get all wrinkled. “Wrinkled” (wrinkled) is when you  put your clothes in a certain way that causes them to not be flat, to have a bunc h of lines in them.

A garment bag is a large bag then that is used for transporting usually a suit or a dress – some sort of formal clothing, although it d oesn’t have to be. The verb “to

hang up” is used to describe the action where you a re putting something, say a piece of clothing, into a closet. You want a piece of clothing to hang down vertically. Usually you put it on something called a “hanger” (hanger). A hanger is a triangular piece of metal or plastic that has a l ittle round hook on the top.

You put the clothing on the hanger and then you put  that hook over a bar or a, what we would call, “rod” (rod) in your closet. Thi s keeps your clothes, once again, from getting wrinkled. A garment bag typical ly has hangers inside of it and/or it has a hook on the top that you can use to  hang it in a closet. That’s what Leona means when she tells the driver that the garm ent bag should be hung up in the closet. “Hung” is the past participle of “ha ng.”

Leona then asks, “Where is my expandable bag?” “Exp andable” (expandable) comes from the verb “to expand,” which means to mak e bigger, to make something larger. An “expandable bag,” then, would be a piece of luggage that you could make bigger if you had more things to put  in it. It will get bigger for you, if you will, usually because the material is soft a nd will expand or because there is some additional space in the piece of luggage th at you can use if you need more room.

The driver says, “Do you mean this duffel bag?” A “ duffel (duffel) bag” is an example of an expandable bag, typically. It is a so ft cloth bag, usually in the shape of a round tube. We often associate duffel ba gs with people transporting their clothing back and forth – say, to a gym to ex ercise – but it could also be used just to transport a large amount of clothing o r other items when you travel. Duffel bags have a zipper on the top that opens and  allows you to put things in and take things out of the bag.

Leona says, “Yes. You can leave that right here. Hm m, where is my carry-on?” A “carry-on” is a small suitcase that you can bring w ith you on the plane to either put in front of you in the seat in front of you – u nderneath it – or above you in what are called the “overhead bins” (bins). That’s a piece of carry-on luggage. Most airlines in the United States allow you to bri ng one piece of carry-on luggage when you get on the plane. Your big suitcas es have to be typically checked, which is another way of saying they’re put  in the plane, but below where the passengers are, in the bottom part of the  plane.

Leona in fact refers to the checked baggage in the very next sentence. She says, “All I see is my checked baggage.” Once again, your  “checked baggage” is baggage that you give to the airline, and the airli ne puts it underneath the plane and then gives it back to you (you hope) when you a rrive to wherever you’re

going. Leona is looking for her checked baggage. Sh e says, “I thought I gave you my carry-on too.” The driver says, “You did, ma’am,  and it’s right here.”

Leona says, “Oh, good. When can I expect my trunk t o arrive?” A “trunk” (trunk) here refers to a large box that has hard sides on i t and a top that is used for transporting a large amount of books, clothing, or other items for travel. Trunks, or “travel trunks,” aren’t very popular anymore. Yo u usually will see them in movies – old movies – about people who are travelin g either by ship or by plane. They’re not very easy or convenient to move around.

People have trunks in their homes, however, to stor e things, especially clothing that they’re not wearing currently. My mother used to keep all of the winter clothing in trunks in our attic, in the very top pa rt of our house, so that it wouldn’t take up space in the rooms. She would then, of cour se, take it down and bring the clothing to us when the weather got cold – whic h unfortunately in Minnesota was often.

The driver says, “Your trunk? You had a trunk?” He’ s surprised that Leona is asking about it. Leona says, “Yes, I had a trunk. D idn’t you see it at the airport?” The driver says, “Uh, no. I must have overlooked it .” “To overlook” (overlook) something here means to ignore or to miss something . You didn’t see it. You didn’t notice it.

Leona says, “You mean you left behind my trunk?” the phrasal verb “to leave behind” something or “to leave something behind” me ans not to take something with you when you take all of the other items. It’s  something usually that you’ve forgotten. “I left my wallet behind in the hotel ro om” – I forgot to bring it with me.

Leona is a little angry with her driver. She says, “Who knows what has become of it by now?” The expression “what will become of” so mething is used when you’re worried about something and you’re not sure what wi ll happen. You may worry about your son or daughter: “What will become of my  son if he doesn’t get a job? What will become of my daughter if she doesn’t stud y in school?” You’re worried about their future.

The driver says, “I’m sure I’ll be able to find it”  – that is, the trunk – “and deliver it or bring it here to you.” Leona says, “I knew I sho uld have used a luggage forwarding service.” “To forward” (forward) somethi ng means to send it to another person. We use that term in email, for exam ple. When we forward a message to someone, we are taking a message someone  sent to us and sending it to somebody else.

A “luggage forwarding service” would be a special s ervice that takes your luggage and transports it to the place where you’re  going. So, instead of you bringing your luggage to the airport and having to worry about it, you give it to someone else at your house. They take it to the air port and it’s transported to the place where you’re traveling. Most people don’t do this. It’s probably much more expensive, but you could do it.

The driver says to Leona, “You might consider trave ling light next time, ma’am.” The driver is being somewhat rude here. He’s tellin g Leona that she should travel light next time. “To travel light” means to bring f ewer items, to not bring as many suitcases. Leona says, “What did you say?” She’s ob viously upset with the driver, angry with the driver.

The driver says, “Nothing. I’m going to fetch your trunk as we speak.” The driver realizes his mistake and he doesn’t repeat what he said to Leona. Instead, he just says, “Nothing,” meaning I didn’t say anything , or what I said wasn’t meant for you, or I didn’t really mean what I said. The d river says, “I’m going to fetch (fetch) your trunk as we speak.” “To fetch” somethi ng means to get something and bring it back.

We often use that verb with a dog, when we throw a ball and the dog runs after the ball and brings it back to us. We sometimes wil l use that verb to describe that action. We’ll even yell at the dog, “Fetch!” meanin g “Run after the ball – get it, and bring it back.” More generally, however, it mea ns to go and get something and bring it back, typically to another person. “I will fetch your purse, dear.” I will go and get your purse for you and bring it back to you, my loveliness. That’s what I say to my wife every day.

The driver is going to fetch Leona’s trunk “as we s peak,” he says. The expression “as we speak” means right now, right away, immediat ely. Leona responds, “I should hope so.” That expression “I should hope so”  is one you say when you are annoyed, upset, or angry, and you are expressin g your desire that something happen, especially something done by someone else.

So, for example, if you’re at a restaurant and the waiter charges you too much for your meal – the waiter brings you your bill, your c heck, and you look at it and you say, “Oh, this is wrong.” The waiter says, “Oh, I’m  sorry, sir. I’ll change that right away.” You might respond, “I should hope so” if you ’re very upset or very angry.

However, I don’t recommend using this phrase normal ly because there is an idea of not just being angry, but being somehow superior  to the other person – that you are above the other person and that the other p erson has done something

 very wrong, something that has hurt you, even. So, it’s not an expression you would normally use in daily conversation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Driver: Ma’am, where would you like these suitcases ?

Leona: The three wheeled suitcases should go next t o the bed, and the garment bag should be hung up in the closet. Where is my ex pandable bag?

Driver: Do you mean this duffel bag?

Leona: Yes. You can leave that right there. Hmm, wh ere is my carry-on? All I see is my checked baggage. I thought I gave you my carr y-on, too.

# Having Breathing Problems

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,047 – Having Breathing Problems.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,047. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Having Breathing Problems,”  a dialogue between Russ and Cheryl with a vocabulary related to “breathing”  – putting air into your lungs and breathing out again. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russ: Why are you wheezing like that?

Cheryl: I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little short of breath. My lungs feel like they’ve closed up.

Russ: Maybe you should get that checked out. You co uld have asthma.

Cheryl: Do you really think so? My nasal passages h ave been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold. My sinuses hurt, too .

Russ: I’m not a doctor, but you may have something more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something.

Cheryl: Wow, so this could be something really seri ous?

Russ: Why do you sound hopeful that you have a seri ous condition?

Cheryl: I’m not. That would be stupid.

Russ: And yet, you sounded positively giddy that yo u might be laid up for a couple of weeks. Does this have anything to do with  your upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?

 Cheryl: If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Russ saying to Cheryl, “Wh y are you wheezing like that?” “To wheeze” (wheeze) means to make a loud so und while breathing, usually because you’re having problems breathing – perhaps you’re not getting enough oxygen into your lungs. “To wheeze” is to [w heezing]. That could be an example of wheezing.

Cheryl says, “I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little s hort of breath.” “To be short of breath” (breath) means that you have to breathe qui ckly in order to get enough oxygen into your lungs. Usually we are short of bre ath when we are doing a lot of physical activity or we’re running up a set of stai rs. You might become short of breath. You might have a little bit of difficulty b reathing, especially if you’re not used to doing a lot of physical activity.

Cheryl says, “My lungs feel like they’ve closed up. ” Your “lungs” (lungs) are the organs in your body, the parts of your body, that bring in air and “expel” air, we would say, when you “inhale” (inhale) – when you pu t air into your lungs – and then you “exhale” (exhale) – when the air goes out of your lungs, when it is pushed out of your lungs. Cheryl says her lungs “fe el like they’ve closed up.” “To close up” normally means to no longer be open, but here it probably means something more like not having enough room to move or to expand.

Russ says, “Maybe you should get that checked out.”  “To get something checked (checked) out” means to have something looked at, i nvestigated. The phrasal verb “to check out” means to look at, to investigat e. We use the phrase “to get something checked out” typically when we’re talking  about some sort of medical issue – say, you have a hand that is been bothering  you, it hurts. Someone may say to you, “You should get that checked out,” mean ing you should go to a doctor or a nurse and have them look at it and make sure t here’s nothing wrong with you.

Russ says, “You could have asthma.” “Asthma” (asthm a) is a medical condition that makes it very difficult for people to breathe properly and easily. My older brothers had asthma and my father had asthma, quite  a serious case of asthma, actually. Cheryl says, “Do you really think so? My nasal passages have been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold.” the word “nasal” (nasal) refers to

your nose. A “passage” is an area where something m oves in and out of, or goes through.

So, your “nasal passages” are the parts of your nos e where the air goes in and out, where you breathe in – you inhale – and you br eathe out – you exhale. Of course, you can also breathe in and breathe out wit h your mouth, but the nasal passages refer specifically to your nose.

Cheryl says her nasal passages have been “stopped u p.” “To be stopped up” means that there is something blocking the passage so that things cannot move through easily or at all. You could also talk about , say, the pipes that are connected to your sink as being “stopped up.” If yo u put a bunch of food down into the pipes that drain the water from your sink,  the pipe might become stopped up.

When we’re talking about pipes and sinks and toilet s, we actually use another verb more typically, which is “clogged” (clogged). “To be clogged up” means the same as to be stopped up. What’s supposed to move t hrough this area, this passage, is not able to because something is stoppi ng it. That’s the problem that Cheryl has with her nasal passages. She’s not able to breathe easily or at all through her nose because her nasal passages have be en stopped up.

She continues, “My sinuses hurt, too.” Your “sinuse s” (sinuses) are open areas inside the bones of your face that are connected to  your nasal passages. So, it’s part of your “breathing system,” you might call it.  People often have problems with their sinuses. Sometimes your sinuses can get an infection so that they hurt, sometimes quite a lot. I’ve had a sinus infection m yself. It’s very painful. But enough about me, back to Cheryl and Russ.

Russ says, “I’m not a doctor but you may have somet hing more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something.” Russ says he’s not a doctor, but he thinks that Cheryl might have a more serious illness or problem with her body. He says that she may have “b ronchitis” (bronchitis). Bronchitis is a condition where you have typically an infection of the tubes, the passages, that lead into the lungs. Usually it caus es coughing and difficulty breathing and can be quite serious. You need to go to a doctor to get medicine if you have bronchitis, usually.

Russ says that Cheryl might also have pneumonia. “P neumonia” (pneumonia) – notice the “p” is silent; we don’t pronounce it – i s also an infection related to your lungs. When you have pneumonia, your lungs often fi ll with a fluid, a liquid, which

makes it difficult to breathe. A pneumonia can also  be quite serious. In fact, you can die from pneumonia.

Russ tells Cheryl that she needs a “chest x-ray.” Y our “chest” (chest) is the upper part of your body where your lungs are located, as well as your heart and a few other things. An “x-ray” is a special photograph th at they take of the inside of your body. So, a “chest x-ray” would be one of thes e special photographs. Usually you get a chest x-ray when the doctor think s there might be something more seriously wrong with your lungs or your breath ing.

Cheryl is surprised. She says, “Wow! So this could be something really serious?” Russ says, “Why do you sound hopeful that you have a serious condition?” Russ is a little confused by Cheryl’s reaction. It almos t seems as if Cheryl wanted to be sick. Cheryl says, “I’m not. That would be stupid.”

Russ says, “And yet, you sounded positively giddy t hat you might be laid up for a couple of weeks.” “Giddy” (giddy) means very happy,  very excited, almost out of control with excitement. “Positively” here means co mpletely, thoroughly, entirely. “Positively giddy,” then, means you are very excite d. You are completely excited, very happy about something. Russ thinks that Cheryl  is happy about being “laid up.” “To be laid (laid) up” means to be forced to s tay in bed, usually because you are sick or have some illness.

Russ says, “Does this have anything to do with your  upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?” “Upcoming” means happening soon in t he future. We might also use the word “approaching.” It’s something that’s g oing to be happening soon – maybe in a day, maybe in a week, maybe in a month.

Cheryl says, “If you had to go to Abrahamville, wou ldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?” “Abrahamville” is, of course, not a real place, but it’s obviously a place where Cheryl does not want to go. That’s why she as ks Russ, “If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too?” A n “out” (out) here means a reason or an excuse for not doing something. Cheryl  is looking for a reason not to go to Abrahamville. She’s looking for an “out.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Russ: Why are you wheezing like that?

Cheryl: I’m not wheezing. I’m just a little short of breath. My lungs feel like they’ve closed up.

Russ: Maybe you should get that checked out. You co uld have asthma.

Cheryl: Do you really think so? My nasal passages h ave been stopped up, so I just thought I had a bad cold. My sinuses hurt, too .

Russ: I’m not a doctor, but you may have something more serious, maybe bronchitis or pneumonia. You need a chest x-ray or something.

Cheryl: Wow, so this could be something really seri ous?

Russ: Why do you sound hopeful that you have a seri ous condition?

Cheryl: I’m not. That would be stupid.

Russ: And yet, you sounded positively giddy that yo u might be laid up for a couple of weeks. Does this have anything to do with  your upcoming business trip to Abrahamville?

Cheryl: If you had to go to Abrahamville, wouldn’t you wish for an out, too – any out?

# Launching an Initial Public Offering

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,048 – Launching an Initial Public Offering.

This episode is a dialogue between Zoe and Midas ab out initial public offerings. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zoe: What are you looking at?

Midas: It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO. I wish  I could get in on the initial public offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly traded.

Zoe: I’m not really familiar with how the stock mar ket works. You mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?

Midas: That’s right. An IPO is a way for a privatel y owned company to become a publicly owned one. The owners of the company do it  to raise capital, or sometimes it’s for early investors to cash in.

Zoe: Why can’t you buy stock in the initial public offering?

Midas: A company like Boogle works with an underwri ter, like a major investment bank, to help set the share price and to find buyer s for the initial offering.

Zoe: Okay, I’m following you so far.

Midas: Well, that first sale of stock is usually do ne in bulk, and I don’t have a few million dollars lying around to buy that much stock . Luckily for me, those first buyers then turn around and sell that stock in smal ler amounts.

Zoe: And that’s when you’ll buy.

Midas: That’s right. You should get in on it, too.

Zoe: You mean buy some Boogle stock?

Midas: Sure, why not?

Zoe: And risk losing my shirt? No, thanks!

[end of dialogue]

Zoe asks Midas, “What are you looking at?” What are  you reading? Midas says, “It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO.” A “prospect us” (prospectus) is a printed document, usually, that provides information about some investment opportunity.

One of the laws here in the United States requires that companies who want to sell stock or sell partial ownership in their compa nies have to print out or give people written information about the company and the possible risks involved – the possible ways that you might lose your money. T his document, which is probably now communicated to people more by PDF tha n by mail, is called a “prospectus.”

Midas is looking at a prospectus for a company’s IP O. IPO stands for “Initial Public Offering.” “Initial” (initial) here means the first time it’s done. A “public offering” is when a company decides it’s going to s ell “stock” – partial ownership in the company – allowing the average person, or at  least some people, to buy partial ownership in the company. This is abbreviat ed “IPO,” and it stands for Initial Public Offering.

Midas says, “I wish I could get in on the initial p ublic offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly t raded.” “To get in on” something means to participate in something that us ually only a small group of people are allowed to participate in. Sometimes whe n a company has an IPO and they start to sell stock, it will only be avail able to a certain group of people. However, eventually the company becomes “publicly t raded,” allowing anyone to buy stock in it.

“Publicly traded” means that the shares in the comp any, stock in the company, is sold to the public, usually through what’s called a  “stock exchange,” such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchan ge. Yeah, they have a stock exchange in Toronto. Of course they do. Many countries have stock exchanges. There are a couple here in the U.S. and several in Europe and in other countries as well.

Well, we’re talking about a publicly traded company  here. Zoe says, “I’m not really familiar with how the stock market works.” T he “stock market” refers generally to the financial market in which people b uy and sell shares in companies. The “stock market” often refers to a par ticular exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. However, it can also be us ed to refer to the activity of all the different exchanges in the country or even around the world.

People sometimes say, “I’m going to put money in the stock market” – I’m going to buy stocks. I’m going to buy partial shares in c ompanies. Zoe doesn’t understand how the stock market works. She says, “You mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?” A “share” is your small perc entage of ownership of a company. It’s an equal part; if you own more shares , you own more parts of the company. The share is, if you will, the unit of own ership.

Midas says, “That’s right. An IPO is a way for a pr ivately owned company to become a publicly owned one.” If we say something i s “privately owned,” we mean that the average person on the street can’t bu y partial ownership in the company. The company is owned, say, by one family o r one group of investors. “Publicly owned companies” are companies that sell partial ownership, sell stock, in their companies, and these companies have differ ent regulations, different rules they have to follow, because they are publicl y owned.

An initial public offering is a way for a privately  owned company to get more money – for selling more of its product or for doing research or for expanding the business somehow. Midas says, “The owners of the co mpany do it” – that is, have an IPO – “to raise capital.” “Capital” (capita l) refers to money that is used for some business purpose. “To raise (raise) capita l” means to get more money, to get money from people for some particular busine ss project.

Midas says, “Sometimes the IPOs are for early inves tors to cash in,” or perhaps “to cash in on.” An “early investor” is someone who  gives money for partial ownership in the company when the company is still relatively new or young. A privately owned company can get money from people w ho help it grow, and then when there’s an IPO and the company’s stock is wort h a lot of money, these

initial investors – these early investors – often c ash in. “To cash in” means to make a lot of money by selling what you have.

So, you sell your shares in the company in order to  get your money back plus a lot of other money. At least, that’s the idea. Zoe then asks, “Why can’t you buy stock in the initial public offering?” Midas says, “A company like Boogle works with an underwriter, like a major investment bank.”  An “underwriter” (underwriter) is an individual – but more commonly, a company – t hat purchases shares from a company and then resells them to people who want to  buy them, to investors.

Usually, this is done through something like an inv estment bank. An “investment bank” is a large bank that has investments and that  helps companies raise capital through selling stocks. Midas says that the  underwriter helps set the share price and find buyers for the initial offering. The  “share price” is how much that one unit of partial ownership is worth, how much it  will cost you. Zoe says, “Okay, I’m following you so far,” meaning I understand wha t you mean up to this point.

Midas continues, “Well, that first sale of stock is  usually done in bulk.” “In bulk” (bulk) means in a large quantity, when you buy a lo t of something at once. Some people, when they see a good sale on, I don’t know,  paper towels or toilet paper or cans of tuna, will buy them in bulk. They’ll buy  lots of them because the price is good. I buy my coffee in bulk whenever it goes o n sale at the grocery store; I buy as many as I can at a cheap price.

That’s what Midas is talking about when he says tha t the sale of stock is done “in bulk,” meaning it’s sold in large quantities. That means that you have to have a lot of money, typically, in order to buy it. Midas says, “I don’t have a few million dollars lying around to buy that much stock.” When we talk about something “lying (lying) around,” we mean available – somethi ng, typically money, that you can just access, get the use of, quickly, that’s no t being used for anything else.

Midas says, “Luckily for me” – fortunately for me –  “those first buyers then turn around and sell that stock in smaller amounts.” The  phrasal verb “to turn around” here means to immediately do something else, usuall y buy or sell. For example, I could buy a new computer today and then turn around  and sell it tomorrow to someone else for a higher price. Or, I could sell m y computer today and turn around tomorrow and buy a new computer. So, it usua lly refers to buying and then selling, or selling and then buying – the two actions being done very close together in time.

Zoe says, “And that’s when you’ll buy?” meaning whe n the initial investors who have a lot of money start selling their stock in sm aller amounts. Midas says,

“That’s right” – that’s correct. “You should get in  on it, too.” Zoe says, “You mean buy some Boogle stock?” Midas says, “Sure, why not? ”

Zoe says, “And risk losing my shirt? No, thanks.” “ To lose (lose) your shirt (shirt)” means to lose all your money, typically in some sor t of investment. You could, for example, loan your money to a friend who’s starting  a business, and then the business is not successful and you don’t get your m oney back. If you loaned him all of your money or most of your money, you could lose your shirt – that is, you could go broke. You could have no money left.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Zoe: What are you looking at?

Midas: It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO. I wish  I could get in on the initial public offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly traded.

Zoe: I’m not really familiar with how the stock mar ket works. You mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?

Midas: That’s right. An IPO is a way for a privatel y owned company to become a publicly owned one. The owners of the company do it  to raise capital, or sometimes it’s for early investors to cash in.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,049 – Buying Theater Tickets.

This episode is a dialogue between David and Susie about buying tickets to see a play at a theater. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Susie: I can’t believe I’m going to get to see my f avorite actor in a play. I want front row seats!

David: I’m looking at the venue’s seating plan righ t now, and all front row seats are taken for the entire run. I’m guessing that sea son ticket holders got those.

Susie: Damn! All right. Let’s try to get seats as c lose to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.

David: The only orchestra tickets still available h ave partially obstructed views.

Susie: Okay, we’ll take those.

David: But we won’t be able to see the entire stage . These tickets in the loge or mezzanine, or even the balcony, will give us a bett er view of the play.

Susie: I don’t need to see every part of the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.

David: Wait one second. I see two seats in the seco nd row still available for the matinee performance. Oh no, those are seats for whe elchair access.

Susie: That’s great! We’ll take those.

 David: But neither of us needs wheelchair access.

Susie: I’ll break a leg if I have to, to get that c lose to him.

David: Do the words “obsessed fan” mean anything to  you?

Susie: You can call it obsession, but I call it dev otion!

[end of dialogue]

Susie begins our dialogue by saying to David, “I ca n’t believe I’m going to get to see my favorite actor in a play.” A “play” is a the atrical performance, a dramatic performance usually done on what is called a “stage ” inside of something called a “theater.” “Play” as a noun refers to the perform ance, but it can also refer to the actual words of the performance. We talk about Shak espeare’s plays, like Macbeth  and Julius Caesar . These are dramatic pieces of literature that Shakespeare wrote and that are now performed as pla ys.

Here, Susie is using “play” in the sense of the per formance – the actual acting out of the play, if you will. Susie says, “I want f ront row seats.” The chairs of the places where you sit – the seats in a theater – are  arranged in lines, often curved lines called “rows.” Each row has a certain number of seats, a certain number of places where people can sit. The “front row” would be the row that is closest to the “stage” – the area where the play is being perf ormed.

David says, “I’m looking at the venue’s seating pla n right now and all front row seats are taken for the entire run.” A “venue” (ven ue) is just another word for the place where something is performed, such as a play or concert. The “seating plan” is a picture that shows the different rows in  the theater. Nowadays, when you buy your tickets online over the Internet to se e a play or concert, you can look and see which seats are available on the seati ng plan. The seating plan for this play shows all front row seats taken.

When we say the seats are “taken,” we mean they’re not available; someone else has already bought them. “The front row seats are taken for the entire run,” David says. The “run” (run) of a play is the period  of time that the play is being performed. Most plays are performed for a few weeks , sometimes for months and months. It depends on the play and where it is being performed. There are plays on Broadway; the street in New York that has large theaters where you can see theatrical performances has plays that have bee n running for years. So, it just depends on the play and how popular it is.

 David says, “I’m guessing that season ticket holder s got those.” “Season ticket holders” are people who buy tickets for all of the different plays being performed either at a specific theater or, more typically, by  a theater company – a group of actors that puts on plays. You could also be a seas on ticket holder for a professional baseball team or for a college footbal l team. That means you would have tickets for all of the games during the time w hen games are being played during the season.

For example, baseball season is from April to Octob er. If you had season tickets, you would have tickets for all of the games during that period of time in a given year. I used to have season tickets for one of the theater groups here in Los Angeles. That was many years ago, I’m afraid. David  says the season ticket holders probably got the front row seats. They get the first opportunity to buy seats.

Susie is not happy. She even swears, she’s so unhap py. She says, “Damn!” (damn) “All right. Let’s try to get seats as close to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.” The “stage” is the pl ace where the play is performed. It’s usually a raised floor that’s somewhat above t he people who are watching the play, so everyone can see it easily.

In some theaters, right next to the stage there’s a  place for an orchestra – a group of musicians – to play music. However, many t heaters have what’s called an “orchestra section,” where there are seats that you can purchase that are also close to the stage in the very front section of the  theater. That’s where Susie wants to get tickets. David says, however, “The onl y orchestra tickets still available have partially obstructed views.”

If your view is “obstructed” (obstructed), it is bl ocked. You can’t actually see it. “Partially” means partly, not completely. So, seats  that have a partially obstructed view are seats from which you can see the stage, bu t there might be something blocking your view. There might be a pole or there might be, I don’t know, part of a wall that is blocking your view. Often in large t heaters there are what are called “pillars” (pillars) that are used to support the ro of, to hold the roof up, but if the seat is behind the pillar or next to the pillar, it  may obstruct or block your view.

Susie says, “Well, we’ll take those” – we’ll take t he partially obstructed view seats. David says, “But we won’t be able to see the  entire stage.” “Entire” here means the whole thing, completely. He then says, “T hese tickets,” referring to a different set of tickets, “in the loge or mezzanine , or even the balcony, will give us a better view of the play.” Theaters are divided in to different sections. We talked

about the “orchestra section,” which would be right  next to the stage. The “loge” (loge) section of a theater is located in the front  of the balcony in a theater.

A “balcony” (balcony) is a second level in the thea ter. You have seats on the ground floor, the first floor of the theater, and t hen you may have some seats on a second level. That second level is called the “ba lcony.” The “loge,” then, is the front section of the balcony. The word “mezzanine” (mezzanine) usually refers to the middle of something. “Mezzanine,” in the theate r, would be the section in a balcony where there is more than one balcony.

So, if you have two balconies, which would be three  total levels of seats, the middle or lowest balcony would be the “mezzanine le vel.” Sometimes you’ll see that word “mezzanine” refer to a level in a buildin g that’s in between, say, the ground floor and the floor above it. It’s actually a floor in between two other floors that are numbered either 1 and 2, or 0 and 1. Here it refers to a balcony in the theater – the lowest balcony.

Notice, however, that David talks about the balcony  seats. Mezzanine seats are in the balcony, in a balcony. But when we talk abou t balcony seats, especially if the theater is a big one and it has more than one b alcony, you often are referring to the upper levels, the upper balconies, not the l ower one, not the mezzanine. It’s a little confusing because they’re all called “balconies,” but in this case it means seats that are above the mezzanine level, on a balcony above the mezzanine.

Susie then says, “I don’t need to see every part of  the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.” We were talking about ob structed views, but Susie says something here a little confusing. She says, “ I don’t need to see every part of the play.” Normally when we talk about a part of  the play, we’re talking about a section of it, not seeing just part of the stage. P erhaps that’s what she means here. She says she just wants to get as close to he r favorite actor as possible. David says, “Wait one second,” meaning stop talking ; wait for me to do something or tell you something.

Then he says, “I see two seats in the second row st ill available for the matinee performance.” The “second row” would be the row beh ind the front row. A “matinee (matinee) performance” is a performance du ring the day. Typically, plays are performed at night, but sometimes they pe rform them during the day, say at two o’clock in the afternoon. That would be a matinee performance. You can also talk about a “matinee movie,” a movie that  is shown in a movie theater in the afternoon in addition to the evening.

David has found a couple of seats, but then he real izes there’s a problem. He says, “Oh no, those seats are for wheelchair access .” A “wheelchair” is a seat with round wheels on them (I guess most wheels woul d be round, right?) that allow the person in the chair to move back and forw ard. Wheelchairs are for those who are not able to walk, or walk very easily . “Wheelchair access” refers to a place where wheelchairs can be put in a theater, in this case, in order to watch the play.

Susie says, “That’s a great! We’ll take those.” She  wants David to buy these wheelchair access seats. David says, “But neither of us needs wheelchair access.” Susie responds, “I’ll break a leg if I hav e to, to get that close to him.” Susie says she’s going to go out and break her leg in order to get a wheelchair so she can sit in the seats. David says, “Do the wo rds ‘obsessed fan’ mean anything to you?”

A “fan” (fan) is someone who enjoys a particular ki nd of entertainment or a particular person. “Obsessed” (obsessed) is when yo u are only able to think about one thing. You can’t think about anything els e. An “obsessed fan” would be a fan who will do anything to get close to the pers on or the object of which he or she is a fan, I guess. The expression “Do the words  (blank) mean anything to you?” is sort of a funny way of saying that you are  this thing – you are whatever I have described.

So, in this case, David is saying that Susie is an obsessed fan. Susie says, “You can call it obsession, but I call it devotion!” “De votion” (devotion) is love or loyalty towards someone, something, or to God. We can talk about devotion in a religious sense. Susie is devoted to her favorite a ctor – hopelessly devoted to him, you might say.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Susie: I can’t believe I’m going to get to see my f avorite actor in a play. I want front row seats!

David: I’m looking at the venue’s seating plan righ t now, and all front row seats are taken for the entire run. I’m guessing that sea son ticket holders got those.

Susie: Damn! All right. Let’s try to get seats as c lose to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.

 David: The only orchestra tickets still available h ave partially obstructed views.

Susie: Okay, we’ll take those.

David: But we won’t be able to see the entire stage . These tickets in the loge or mezzanine, or even the balcony, will give us a bett er view of the play.

Susie: I don’t need to see every part of the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.

David: Wait one second. I see two seats in the seco nd row still available for the matinee performance. Oh no, those are seats for whe elchair access.

Susie: That’s great! We’ll take those.

David: But neither of us needs wheelchair access.

Susie: I’ll break a leg if I have to, to get that c lose to him.

David: Do the words “obsessed fan” mean anything to  you?

Susie: You can call it obsession, but I call it dev otion!

# Describing Stomach Problems

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,050 – Describing Stomach Problems.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,050. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This story is about describing problems with your s tomach. Let’s get started.  > There’s nothing I enjoy more than spending a couple  of hours relaxing at a café. I sit drinking my tea and reading. What could be bett er?
> Woman: So I think I may have to see a doctor soon. You know I’ve had these terrible pains in my stomach. My digestion is terri ble, and now I think I might have an ulcer!
> Well, I was having a relaxing time until I started overhearing the woman at the next table talking loudly on her cell phone.
> Woman: No, I don’t think it could be lactose intole rance. My bowels are working fine. I don’t have the runs or feel constipated. I just get a really upset stomach and these terrible pains.
> This was definitely not a conversation I waned to l isten to. I looked around for another table, somewhere I could escape to.
> Woman: Yes, I do feel some heartburn and bloating. Do you really think it could be acid reflux? I do have a problem with too much g as and burping a lot. Will an antacid help, do you think?
> By this time, I was in panic mode. If I didn’t get away from this woman soon, I’d surely be sick to my stomach!
> I begin our story by saying, “There is nothing I en joy more than spending a couple of hours relaxing at a café.” I enjoy going to a café and relaxing, not doing any work. “I sit drinking my tea and reading,” I sa y. “What could be better?” Then I hear a woman who’s talking next to me. She says, “So I think I may have to see a doctor soon.” The woman is not talking to me. I’m  sitting in a café and I can hear the woman talking to someone else. She says sh e may have to go see the doctor soon. Why? Well, she then tells us. “You know I’ve had these terrible pains in my stoma ch.” Your “stomach” (stomach) is the part of your body that processes t he food and drink so that you have energy for your body. The woman is having pain s in her stomach. Her stomach hurts. She continues, “My digestion is terr ible, and now I think I might have an ulcer.” “Digestion” (digestion) is the biol ogical process of converting food into energy for your body. The stomach is part of y our “digestive system” – part of the system in your body that converts food into energy.

The woman says her digestion is “terrible.” And, sh e says she thinks she might have an ulcer. An “ulcer” (ulcer) is basically a so re on the inside surface of your stomach that produces pain. Ulcers can be very pain ful. Many ulcers are caused not by food, but by a type of bacteria. We discover ed in the last 20 years or so that there is a kind of bacteria that causes a lot of ulcers, but we won’t go into that.

This woman thinks she might have an ulcer. I then r eturn in the story and comment. I say, “Well, I was having a relaxing time  until I started overhearing the woman at the next table talking loudly on her cell phone.” “To overhear” (overhear) does not mean to hear too much, but rath er it means to hear something without trying to hear it, simply because  you are close to whatever is making that sound. Usually, we use this verb “to ov erhear” when we’re talking about hearing the conversation of another person.

I’m sitting at the café and there is a woman next t o me who is talking loudly on her cell phone. This is one of the things that I be lieve should be illegal, and I will vote for any politician that makes it illegal for y ou to talk loudly on your cell phone inside a café. There, I’ve said it. Now, I’m overhe aring the woman at the next table, and she continues with her conversation abou t her stomach problems. She says, “No, I don’t think it could be lactose intole rance.”

I’m only hearing one side of the conversation – one  person in the conversation. So, we hear the woman responding probably to a ques tion from the person with whom she’s speaking. The woman says she doesn’t thi nk it could be lactose

intolerance. “Lactose” (lactose) refers to a kind of sugar that is found in milk and milk products. If you have an “intolerance” (intole rance) to some kind of food, your body reacts negatively when you eat that food,  or drink that drink.

The prefix “in-” usually means “not,” and that’s wh at it means here – not tolerant. If your body is tolerant of something, it . . . it doesn’t mind it. It doesn’t react negatively. Many people have what is called “lactos e intolerance,” which means they cannot drink milk or other milk products witho ut getting sick. Other people have what is called “carbohydrate intolerance,” whe re your body reacts negatively when they eat too many carbohydrates – t hings like bread and pasta and cake and cookies, all the good stuff.

This woman continues telling us about her problems.  She says, “My bowels are working fine.” Your “bowels” (bowels) are your inte stines. Your intestines are these long tubes inside your body that help to dige st food and to get rid of the food that you no longer need, or that your body doe sn’t need for energy. The woman says, “I don’t have the runs or feel constipa ted.”

Well, here, now we’re getting into some somewhat un pleasant descriptions. The term “the runs” (runs) is used informally in Englis h to refer to what is more properly known as “diarrhea” (diarrhea). “Diarrhea”  is basically waste that comes out of your body – out of your butt, to put it more  explicitly – that isn’t solid. It can be quite painful. “To be constipated” (constipated)  means that you have difficulty getting rid of waste from your body. The woman says  she is not constipated.

She says, “I just get a really upset stomach and th ese terrible pains.” An “upset (upset) stomach” is a feeling of sickness in your s tomach, as though you might vomit or throw up. We might also use the word “naus ea” (nausea) to describe this condition more technically, more medically. “U pset” normally means angry. When we talk about a person being upset, we mean the person is mad, but an “upset stomach” means that your stomach isn’t feeli ng right – that you feel “sick to your stomach,” we might also say. Another word w e might use in this case is “queasy” (queasy).

I then say in the story, “This was definitely not a  conversation I wanted to listen to.” I say, “I looked around for another table,” me aning I looked in the café to find another table. “Somewhere I could escape to,” I say . “To escape” (escape) to somewhere means to go to somewhere that is safer th an where you are now, or perhaps more comfortable than where you are now. the verb “to escape” means also to leave some sort of imprisonment or confinem ent. You could talk about a prisoner in jail “escaping” – getting out of the ja il (illegally, of course) and running away.

 I’m not in jail in this story. I’m in a café, but s till I need to escape to somewhere more comfortable. But again, we hear the woman spea king. She says, “Yes, I do feel some heartburn and bloating.” “Heartburn” (hea rtburn) is a painful or uncomfortable burning feeling, usually inside of yo ur chest or just below your chest. It sometimes caused by eating, for example, spicy food, food that is hot. (Hot in the sense of being spicy, not hot in the se nse of having a high temperature.) Many different things could cause hea rtburn, I suppose.

The other thing the woman says she feels is some “b loating” (bloating). “Bloating” is when your body – your stomach or your intestines  – has extra liquid or perhaps gas, and it increases the size of your body, or par ts of your body. The woman says, “Do you really think it could be acid reflux? ” “Acid (acid) reflux (reflux)” is a medical condition in which the acid in your stomach , a liquid in your stomach, moves up into the esophagus, which is the tube that  carries the food from the mouth to the stomach. Once again, it can be quite p ainful.

The woman says, “I do have a problem with too much gas and burping a lot.” “Gas” (gas) here refers to someone who has air come  out of their butt, and it’s often not very pleasant smelling. The more technica l word would be “flatulence” (flatulence). A somewhat cruder, informal word is “ fart” (fart). I’ll have to thank Dr. Tse for writing this script for me to explain later  on. But, back to the script.

The woman says she has a problem with “too much gas  and burping a lot.” “To burp” (burp) means for air to come out of your mout h, usually in a way that is “involuntary” – that you don’t mean to happen – alt hough I guess you can make yourself burp, to a certain extent. A “burp“ is gas  coming out of your mouth rather than out of your butt, to put it that way.

The woman then asks, “Will an antacid help, do you think?” An “antacid” (antacid) is a kind of medicine or drug you take to  reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. Remember, the acid in your stomach he lps break down or divide up the food that you are eating in order to convert  it into energy. If you have too much of this acid, it can be painful. That’s why yo u would take an antacid, something to stop or reduce the amount of acid.

I conclude the story by saying, “By this time, I wa s in panic mode.” “To panic” (panic) means to become alarmed, to become perhaps even a little frightened or scared. “Panic mode” (mode) would refer to a situat ion where I feel a lot of anxiety or fear that I need to run away from. I say , “By this time, I was in panic mode. If I didn’t get away from this woman soon” – if I didn’t move away from this

woman – “I’d surely be sick to my stomach.” “To be sick to your stomach” is, as we explained earlier, the same as to have an upset stomach or to be queasy.

Now let’s listen to this very fun dialogue one more  time, at a normal speed.

[start of story]

There’s nothing I enjoy more than spending a couple  of hours relaxing at a café. I sit drinking my tea and reading. What could be bett er?

Woman: So I think I may have to see a doctor soon. You know I’ve had these terrible pains in my stomach. My digestion is terri ble, and now I think I might have an ulcer!

Well, I was having a relaxing time until I started overhearing the woman at the next table talking loudly on her cell phone.

Woman: No, I don’t think it could be lactose intole rance. My bowels are working fine. I don’t have the runs or feel constipated. I just get a really upset stomach and these terrible pains.

This was definitely not a conversation I waned to l isten to. I looked around for another table, somewhere I could escape to.

Woman: Yes, I do feel some heartburn and bloating. Do you really think it could be acid reflux? I do have a problem with too much g as and burping a lot. Will an antacid help, do you think?

By this time, I was in panic mode. If I didn’t get away from this woman soon, I’d surely be sick to my stomach!

This episode is a dialogue between Ruth and Carl ab out threats – things you say to someone that involve hurting them or harming the m in some way. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ruth: I’m really glad you’re getting so much suppor t from the public. Look at all of these bags of fan mail.

Carl: Only about half of that is fan mail. The rest  is hate mail.

Ruth: Hate mail? Who would send you hate mail?

Carl: Lots of people. People who are disgruntled wr ite to me about their grievances.

Ruth: Really?

Carl: Don’t look so surprised. We’ve gotten bomb th reats, and I’ve even received a few death threats.

Ruth: Death threats?! Aren’t you worried about your  personal safety?

Carl: Not really. Most people are just venting, and  others are trying to intimidate me. I’m not going to buckle under just because I ge t a few letters.

Ruth: But it only takes one mentally unbalanced per son to carry through on threats. Have you considered getting a bodyguard?

Carl: No, I don’t need any protection. I just need to keep plugging away and getting things done.

Ruth: I finally know what to get you for your birth day.

Carl: What?

Ruth: A bulletproof vest. [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ruth saying to Carl, “I’m really glad you’re getting so much support from the public. Look at all these bag s of fan mail.” A “fan” here refers to a person who likes a certain thing or a c ertain other person, usually a famous person. You can be a fan of a sport like bas eball or soccer. “Fan mail” refers to letters that a famous person, typically, receives from people who like that person, who admire that person, who say nice t hings about that person.

Carl says, “Only about half of that is fan mail. the rest is hate mail.” “Hate (hate) mail” are letters that express anger or disgust for  a person. If you really don’t like a person, you might send them hate mail. Well, I do n’t think you should. “Hate,” of course, is a feeling of anger and of dislike for  another person, a very strong feeling of that. “Hate mail” is something that cele brities – famous people – get, as well as fan mail. Ruth is surprised. She says, “Hat e mail? Who would send you hate mail?”

Carl says, “Lots of people. People who are disgrunt led write to me about their grievances.” “To be disgruntled” (disgruntled) mean s to be upset – to be unhappy about some situation or dissatisfied with something . “Grievances” (grievances) are complaints, statements, or descriptions of some thing you don’t like, some problem that you’re having. The word “grievance” is  somewhat more formal than “complaint.” Ruth says, “Really?” Again, she’s surp rised. Carl says, “Don’t look so surprised,” meaning don’t be surprised. “We’ve g otten bomb threats, and I’ve even received a few death threats.”

A “threat” (threat) is a statement that you are going to hurt someone or harm someone. It’s a warning that you are going to do so mething bad to another person. Sometimes people use threats to prevent peo ple from doing things. “If you do X, I will hurt you.” You’re trying to preven t them from doing something by threatening them. A “bomb threat” is when someone s ays that they are planting an explosive device, a bomb that may go off – may e xplode – and hurt or even kill people.

“Death threats” are when people say, “I’m going to kill you” – when they tell someone that they will be murdered, basically. Unfo rtunately, there are people in the world that do that sort of thing. Ruth is again  very surprised. She says, “Death threats?! Aren’t you worried about your pers onal safety?” “Personal (personal) safety” refers to the risk of you being injured or even killed. If you go into certain parts of American cities at night, you  might fear for your personal safety. You may fear that someone will hurt you or even kill you. The best thing is to stay away from those places.

Carl, however, is not worried about his personal sa fety. He says, “Most people are just venting, and others are trying to intimida te me.” “To vent” (vent) here means to express one’s frustrations or dissatisfact ion – to say a lot of things that will or may not be true, but it makes you feel bett er if you say it, if you complain about a certain thing. Sometimes when people get an gry, they just need to vent. They just need to get all that anger out by saying things that they don’t like, even if some of those things aren’t really true.

Carl says these people who write hate mail and send  him hate mail are “just venting.” Others, however are trying to intimidate him. “To intimidate” (intimidate) means to make someone feel frightened or inferior b y showing that you are bigger or better or smarter than that person. If so meone intimidates you, that person makes you feel afraid, perhaps even for your  personal safety.

Carl says, “I’m not going to buckle under just beca use I got a few letters.” The phrasal verb “to buckle (buckle) under” means to fa il to support yourself in some way or to fail to continue doing what you were doing because you felt pressure or, perhaps, because you were intimidated. “To buck le under” means to agree to do something also that you don’t want to do, but yo u are forced to do it. You are pressured to do it. Carl says he’s not going to buc kle under just because he got a few letters.

Ruth says, “But it only takes one mentally unbalanc ed person to carry through on threats.” “Mentally unbalanced” refers to someone w ho has some sort of mental illness – someone who is a bit crazy, quite frankly . “To carry through on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to follow a pla n through to completion, to do something from start to finish, to actually do what  you say you’re going to do. Ruth is afraid that some mentally unbalanced person  is going to carry through on these threats – is going to actually harm Carl.

Ruth asks, “Have you considered,” have you thought about, “getting a bodyguard?” A “bodyguard” (bodyguard) is a person w hose job it is to provide security for another person, to keep another person  safe. Some of you may

remember a movie with Kevin Costner and Whitney Hou ston called The Bodyguard , about a famous singer’s bodyguard. It was a horri ble movie, but if you saw it, you know what I mean.

Carl then says, “No, I don’t need any protection.” “Protection” is anything that keeps you away from danger or that prevents you fro m being hurt. Carl says, “I just need to keep plugging away and getting things done.” “To plug (plug) away” means to continue to do something, especially to co ntinue to do something that may not seem important that you may have to do over  and over again, but that has to be done. We often use this phrasal verb when  we’re doing something that isn’t very interesting or perhaps even very difficu lt, but has to be done. You plug away at it.

Ruth then says, “I finally know what to get you for  your birthday.” Carl says, “What?” Ruth says, “A bulletproof vest.” A “vest” ( vest) is a piece of clothing you wear like a jacket, except it doesn’t have any arms  – technically, it doesn’t have any sleeves, which are the parts of a shirt or jack et that cover your arms. A “bullet“ (bullet) is a small piece of metal that is  fired from a gun. “Bulletproof” (bulletproof) means that whatever it is, will preve nt a bullet from, in this case, going into your body.

A “bulletproof vest” is worn by police officers and  other people in case someone tries to shoot them. The vest will stop the bullet.  It will make sure the bullet doesn’t enter into the body of the person. You can also have “bulletproof glass” – very thick glass that even if you shot a bullet at it would not break. Most banks in Los Angeles, for example, have bulletproof glass. I n order to talk to someone, you have to talk to someone who’s on the other side  of the bulletproof glass. They don’t wear bulletproof vests in the bank, I do n’t think.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ruth: I’m really glad you’re getting so much suppor t from the public. Look at all of these bags of fan mail.

Carl: Only about half of that is fan mail. The rest  is hate mail.

Ruth: Hate mail? Who would send you hate mail?

# A Product Recall

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,052 – A Product Recall.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,052. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, with additional courses in Busin ess and Daily English I think you will enjoy.

This episode is a dialogue between Melissa and Lee about a company that made something with a problem and had to get people to s end it back to them in order to fix it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa: This is a disaster! If we have to recall 1 00,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.

Lee: We have no choice. The product defect poses a safety hazard. If we don’t act quickly, we’ll have a huge liability issue on o ur hands.

Melissa: I think we’re blowing this out of proporti on. Only a small amount of our June product run was affected.

Lee: Yes, but even one case of someone getting hurt  because of the defect would be a PR nightmare, and that’s on top of the c harges of negligence we’d have to face in court. We need to get ahead of this  now.

Melissa: All right, all right. I guess we have no c hoice. Should we hold a press conference to announce the recall?

Lee: We’ll send out a press release first and then hold a press conference.

Melissa: I’m putting you in charge of it. Get it do ne.

Lee: You mean in charge of getting the press releas e sent out?

Melissa: I mean that and the press conference. You can face the press and answer their questions.

Lee: You’re throwing me to the wolves?

Melissa: Not at all. I’m helping you raise your pro file in the company. You should be thanking me.

Lee: Somehow I don’t feel so grateful.

[end of dialogue]

The topic on this episode is a product recall. A “p roduct” is a thing, usually a physical thing, that companies produce and sell. Ju st about anything physical can be a product: a computer, a microphone, a piece  of paper – all of these are products. We often distinguish between products, wh ich are typically physical, and “services.” A “service” would be, for example, something a lawyer might do for you. The lawyer isn’t selling you anything. The  lawyer is charging you for his services (and quite a bit, I’m sure).

In this dialogue, Melissa begins by saying, “This i s a disaster.” A “disaster” (disaster) is a crisis, a major problem that will b e difficult to solve or recover from. There are “natural disasters” like earthquakes, hur ricanes, and floods, as well as “man-made disasters” – things that humans cause.

Melissa says, “If we have to recall 100,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.” “To recall” (recall) here refers to a company that makes something, a product, that has a problem, and it has to ask the people wh o bought the product to return the product back to the company so they can get a n ew product, one that works correctly, or to get a “refund” – their money back.  The verb “to recall” can also mean to remember, but here it means something very different.

Melissa says that they will “take a huge loss this year.” A “loss” (loss) is when you spend more money than you bring in. A loss woul d be the opposite of profits. “Profit” is when you make money. A loss is when you  lose money. Lee says, “We have no choice,” meaning we don’t have any other op tion. We have to do it. “The product defect poses a safety hazard.” A “product d efect” (defect) is a problem in the product or a problem with the product.

So, for example, if you make a car and the brakes of the car don’t work properly, don’t work correctly, that would be a good example of a product defect. It would also be a good example of a product defect that pos es a safety hazard. The word

“poses” (poses) here just means presents or causes to happen. A “safety hazard” (hazard) is something that could hurt you or possib ly even kill you.

Lee says, “If we don’t act quickly,” meaning if we don’t do something right now, “we’ll have a huge liability issue on our hands.” “ Liability” (liability) refers to your responsibility, especially your financial responsib ility in case something goes wrong. When Lee says, “We’ll have a huge liability issue,” he means that the company may have to pay out a lot of money to peopl e, especially if people get hurt from their product.

He says we will have this “huge liability issue on our hands.” The expression “on our hands” or “on your hands” means belonging to so meone, especially when we’re talking about responsibility for a problem. I f you’re working on a project at work and suddenly you discover a big problem, you m ight say to your boss, “We have a problem on our hands,” meaning we have a pro blem here. Lee thinks they’ll have a liability problem if they don’t reca ll the product.

Melissa says, “I think we’re blowing this out of pr oportion.” “To blow (blow) something out of proportion (proportion)” means to act as if something were bigger or more important or more serious than it ac tually is. The other word we would use here would be “overreact” (overreact). “T o overreact” is to blow things out of proportion, to make them seem as if they wer e bigger problems than they actually are.

Melissa says, “Only a small amount of our June prod uct run was affected.” A “product run” would be a number of units that were made at the same time, that were manufactured at the same time. Melissa is sayi ng that the defect in the product is only affecting a small number of the pro ducts that they made.

Lee says, “Yes, but even one case,” or one example,  “of someone getting hurt because of the defect would be a PR nightmare.” “PR ” stands for “public relations,” and here it refers to the publicity or the reputation of the company. A “nightmare” is a bad dream. We sometimes use it to describe a terrible situation. Lee continues, “And that’s on top of the charges of  negligence we’d have to face in court.” “On top of” here means in addition to.

So, in addition to the PR nightmare, Lee says, ther e will also be charges of negligence. “Negligence” (negligence) is a term oft en used in the law to refer to the failure of someone to take care of someone or s omething that he is responsible for, especially if that failure results  in or causes harm or even death. “Negligence” refers to a situation where you don’t want to harm someone, but you do things that harm someone, things that you sh ould have not done or that

you should have known not to do. Lee says the compa ny will have to face charges of negligence in court.

He says, “We need to get ahead of this now.” “To ge t ahead of” something means to say and do whatever is necessary so that y ou can control a situation, a situation that is perhaps getting worse. Melissa sa ys, “All right, all right. I guess we have no choice. Should we hold a press conferenc e to announce the recall?” A “press (press) conference” is an event to which y ou invite reporters from television stations or newspapers in order to make a big announcement, in order to say something important about your company and i ts actions.

Melissa is suggesting they hold a press conference.  Notice the verb “hold” is used, especially when we are talking about press co nferences. Lee says, “We’ll send out a press release first and then hold a pres s conference.” A “press release” (release) is a document, either a piece of  paper or perhaps a PDF file, that you send news organizations like television st ations and newspapers and magazines, announcing something important about you r company.

Melissa says, “I’m putting you in charge of it,” me aning you have to do it. “Get it done,” she says. Lee says, “You mean in charge of g etting the press release sent out?” Melissa says, “I mean that and the press conf erence.” You can face the press and answer their questions. “To face” is used  once again here to mean to have to deal with a difficult situation or to have to talk to and handle a certain group of people.

Lee says, “You’re throwing me to the wolves?” This expression “to throw (throw) someone to the wolves (wolves)” means to put someon e in a difficult situation, especially a situation that might be hostile and wh ere the person might have to answer difficult questions. “Wolves” is the plural of “wolf” (wolf), which is an animal, a sometimes dangerous animal. Lee is asking  if he is going to have to suffer, basically, for the mistakes that the compan y made by having to hold a press conference and talk to reporters.

Melissa says, “Not at all,” meaning “No, I’m not th rowing you to the wolves.” “I’m helping you raise your profile in the company. You should be thanking me.” “To raise (raise) your profile (profile)” means to do s omething so that other people notice you – to get attention, positive attention, from other people, especially in your company. Of course, Melissa isn’t trying to ra ise Lee’s profile by making him the person who has to do the press conference, but she acts as though that is what she were doing.

She even says, amazingly, “You should be thanking m e,” meaning that Lee should be grateful – should say thank you for this assignment, this task. Lee says, “Somehow I don’t feel so grateful.” “Grateful ” (grateful) means feeling thankful, wanting to express your thanks to someone . Lee doesn’t feel very grateful, very thankful, for having to do this job.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa: This is a disaster! If we have to recall 1 00,000 units, we’ll take a huge loss this year.

Lee: We have no choice. The product defect poses a safety hazard. If we don’t act quickly, we’ll have a huge liability issue on o ur hands.

Melissa: I think we’re blowing this out of proporti on. Only a small amount of our June product run was affected.

# Buying Food at the Concession Stand

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,053 – Buying Food at a Concession Stand.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,053. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. Take a look at our special courses and/or ESL Podcast Blog  while you’re there.

This episode is a dialogue between Jim and Suki abo ut buying food when you are at a movie theater. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jim: We only have three minutes before the movie st arts. You grab two seats and I’ll hit the concession stand.

***

Suki: Can I help you?

Jim: Yes, I’d like a large popcorn and a hot dog wi th the works.

Suki: Anything else?

Jim: Yes, I’ll also take an order of nachos and a p retzel.

Suki: Sorry, we’re out of pretzels right now, but w e have cotton candy, snow cones, and pizza.

Jim: All right, then give me a slice of pizza.

Suki: Will that be all?

Jim: No, I’d also like a box of licorice, a package  of beef jerky, and an ice cream sandwich.

Suki: Anything to drink?

Jim: Yes, I’ll take two large sodas.

Suki: All right, that’ll be $84.50.

Jim: What?! That’s highway robbery!

Suki: Our prices are posted on the board. You can s ee them right up there. Do you still want all this?

Jim: Just give me the soda and popcorn.

Suki: Are you sure you’ll make it through the movie  with just that?

Jim: I have no choice. I’d have to commit robbery i f I wanted anything else!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jim talking to someone. We ’re not sure who, perhaps his wife or his girlfriend. “We only have three min utes before the movie starts. You grab two seats and I’ll hit the concession stan d.” “To grab” (grab) normally means to use your hand and pick up something, often  quickly. However, here it means to go and get two seats – to find two seats a nd to save them. There’s also the idea here that the theater will fill up and all  the good seats will be taken, and so it’s important for Jim’s friend (or wife, or gir lfriend) to go and get two seats for them to sit in.

Jim says that he’s going to “hit” (hit) the concess ion stand. “To hit” can mean a couple of different things in English. Here, it mea ns to go somewhere and get something quickly, especially to buy something. You  might say, “I’m going to hit the McDonald’s for a hamburger and then drive on the freeway to my brother’s house.” “To hit” here means to go there quickly, ge t what I want, and leave.

Jim is going to go to the “concession (concession) stand (stand).” A concession stand is a place that sells food and drinks, especi ally in a movie theater or in a place where there is a concert or some sort of spor ting event. If you go and watch a baseball game at Dodger Stadium here in Los  Angeles, there are all sorts of concessions stands where you can buy food and drinks, including beer. If you do go to Dodger Stadium, of course, you should call me and invite me to go with you.

Jim is going to hit the concession stand not at Dod ger Stadium, but at the movie theater. The woman at the movie theater, whose name  I guess is Suki, says to

Jim, “Can I help you?” That’s the typical way that someone working at a store will start a conversation – offering to help you. Jim sa ys, “Yes, I’d like a large popcorn and a hot dog with the works.”

A “large popcorn” would be a large container of pop corn. “Popcorn” is a food made from the seeds or kernels of corn, usually put  at very high heat either in oil or in very hot air. Popcorn is usually served at mo vie theaters. It’s a popular food at movie theaters, a popular snack. Typically, popc orn is served with a lot of butter and salt. Jim asked for “a large popcorn and  a hot dog with the works.”

A “hot dog” is a food that looks like a small sausa ge. It’s a type of meat – often a mix of beef and pork, or sometimes just beef or jus t pork – that is very popular, again, at a concession stand, at a sporting event, or at a movie theater. Hot dogs are also eaten by Americans very commonly during the summer. I love hot dogs and eat them all the time since it’s always summer here in beautiful Los Angeles. Many people think hot dogs are a low-quality food, however, so now you know a little bit about the kind of food I eat.

Jim wants “a hot dog with the works” (works). When you order food such as a hot dog or a hamburger “with the works,” you are asking  for all the typical toppings or other things that are put on the food. So, for a ha mburger, for example, the works might include ketchup, mayonnaise, pickles, onions,  mushrooms . . . mmm, making me hungry.

A hot dog with the works would probably have things  such as mustard, ketchup, perhaps horseradish, other kinds of relishes – all of those are things that you might find on a hot dog. Me, I just like my hot dog s plain, nothing else on them. But Jim wants a hot dog with the works.

Suki says, “Anything else?” Jim says, “Yes, I’ll al so take,” meaning I also want to buy, “an order of nachos and a pretzel.” An “order of nachos” is a small bowl of tortilla chips, which is kind of a Mexican specialt y, or at least a Mexican-American specialty. “Nachos” are tortilla chips, fried torti lla chips typically, that have melted cheese on top of them.

A “pretzel” (pretzel) is a bread-like snack that is  usually made into a certain shape. It’s a long tube of the dough of uncooked br ead that is folded into a certain shape. It’s hard to describe. I guess usual ly it is a shape that looks a little like a heart. Pretzels usually have lots of salt on  them. Suki says, “Sorry, we’re out of pretzels right now.” She means they don’t ha ve any more pretzels to sell.

She says, “But we have cotton candy, snow cones, an d pizza.” “Cotton candy, snow cones, and pizza” are like nachos and pretzels  – common foods at a concession stand in a place like a movie theater. L et’s start with “cotton (cotton) candy.” “Cotton” is a material that you make clothi ng out of, but that’s not what we’re talking about here. Cotton candy is a dessert  that is made by using colored sugar. It looks a little like a balloon when you’re  done with it. It’s very light and, of course, very sweet.

“Snow cones” are desserts made by shaving, that is cutting, ice into very small pieces and then putting it into a little container called a “paper cone” (cone). Then you put flavors on top of the ice – usually some so rt of syrup, which is a thick, sweet sauce. You’ll often find snow cones sold at c oncession stands, but also at places like carnivals and fairs. A “pizza” is a pop ular Italian food made by using dough – uncooked bread – that’s flattened into a la rge flat circle, and you put all sorts of yummy, delicious, wonderful things on top of it, like cheese and meats and vegetables and tomato sauce.

Jim says, “All right,” meaning okay, “then give me a slice of pizza.” A “slice (slice) of pizza” is one part of the pizza. Remember, the p izza is a flat, round kind of food. A “slice” would just be one section of the pi zza. Suki says, “Will that be all?” meaning “Do you want to order anything else?” Jim s ays, “No,” meaning “No, that would not be all. I have more things I want to buy. ”

He says, “I’d also like a box of licorice, a packag e of beef jerky, and an ice cream sandwich.” “Licorice” (licorice) is a kind of long,  thin candy, usually red or black, that is chewy, that doesn’t melt in your mouth. In other words, you have to chew it. Licorice was very popular when I was growing up . I’m not sure how popular it still is. I used to love licorice. All of these thi ngs, of course, are basically different forms of sugar that you shouldn’t be eating to begi n with.

Jim also orders a package of “beef jerky” (jerky). Beef jerky is a little different. Beef jerky is not made with a lot of sugar. Instead , it is a salty snack that is made by drying pieces of beef or turkey that have been c ombined with different flavors. It’s a very different kind of food. Personally, I d on’t really like beef jerky. I do like ice cream sandwiches, however. An “ice cream sandwi ch” is a dessert made by putting ice cream in between two large cookies, or things that kind of look like cookies. The kind that I like aren’t really cookies . It’s another kind of sweet covering that goes on both sides of the ice cream.

Suki then asks Jim, “Anything to drink?” Jim says, “Yes, I’ll take two large sodas.” Suki says, “All right, that’ll be $84.50.” Jim says , “What?!” He’s very surprised at the high price of all of these snacks. He says, “Th at’s highway robbery!”

“Highway robbery” (robbery) refers to a very high p rice for something, something that is way too expensive. When someone charges you  a lot more than you think you should be charged, you might say, “That’s highw ay robbery.”

Suki says, “Our prices are posted on the board.” “P osted” (posted) here just means written and displayed so that you can see the m. Suki says, “You can see them right up there” – she’s pointing to where the prices are. “Do you still want all this?” Jim says, “Just give me the soda and popcorn .” So, he’s not going to get anything else but soda pop and popcorn. Suki says, “Are you sure you’ll make it through the movie with just that?” She’s suggesting  that Jim is going to need more food in order to last the entire time watching  the movie. Remember, movies are between 90 and 120 minutes, typically.

Jim says, however, “I have no choice,” meaning I do n’t have any other options. I’m forced to do this. “I’d have to commit robbery if I wanted anything else.” “To commit” (commit) means to perform – a crime, in thi s case. “Robbery” is when you steal something from someone. Jim is making a j oke here. He’s saying that if he wanted anything else, he’ll have to steal it bec ause he can’t afford the price. He doesn’t have enough money to buy all of these th ings.

It’s quite true that the prices in movie theaters f or snacks at the concession stands are extremely expensive – much, much more ex pensive than in other places – but of course, they know that you don’t ha ve anywhere else that you could buy these things, and most movie theaters don ’t allow you to bring your own food in.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jim: We only have three minutes before the movie st arts. You grab two seats and I’ll hit the concession stand.

***

Suki: Can I help you?

Jim: Yes, I’d like a large popcorn and a hot dog wi th the works.

Suki: Anything else?

Jim: Yes, I’ll also take an order of nachos and a p retzel.

 Suki: Sorry, we’re out of pretzels right now, but w e have cotton candy, snow cones, and pizza.

Jim: All right, then give me a slice of pizza.

Suki: Will that be all?

Jim: No, I’d also like a box of licorice, a package  of beef jerky, and an ice cream sandwich.

Suki: Anything to drink?

Jim: Yes, I’ll take two large sodas.

Suki: All right, that’ll be $84.50.

Jim: What?! That’s highway robbery!

Suki: Our prices are posted on the board. You can s ee them right up there. Do you still want all this?

Jim: Just give me the soda and popcorn.

Suki: Are you sure you’ll make it through the movie  with just that?

Jim: I have no choice. I’d have to commit robbery i f I wanted anything else!

This episode is a dialogue between Carlos and Inez about finding someone to be your roommate. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos: Now that your boyfriend has moved out, you need a roommate. There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.

Inez: I know, but I really don’t want to live with a stranger. I’d have to put up with all of their quirks.

Carlos: I don’t think you have a choice. You need s omeone to split the rent and the cost of utilities, not to mention your cable bi ll.

Inez: I’d need someone who could keep the common ar eas neat and clean and who can keep their hands off my stuff.

Carlos: I’m sure you’ll manage to find someone with  those qualities.

Inez: They’d have to help with chores around the ap artment, too, and pitch in with general upkeep.

Carlos: No doubt there’s someone out there who woul dn’t mind doing that.

Inez: Hey, aren’t you looking for a place to live? You could move in here.

Carlos: You mean share an apartment with you? No th anks.

Inez: Why not?

Carlos: I’d just rather not. I don’t think we’d sui t.

Inez: Why wouldn’t we?

Carlos: Do you really want me to spell it out for y ou?

Inez: Yes, in fact, I insist.

Carlos: All right. Let’s just say that you’re a lit tle bit grouchy in the mornings. You know that monster in the Alien  movies?

Inez: Yes.

[silence]

Carlos: Ouch! Ouch! Stop hitting me!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Carlos and Inez talking ab out getting a new roommate. Carlos says that Inez’s old roommate – her boyfrien d, apparently – has moved out. “To move out” means to leave the place where y ou are living and go somewhere else, go somewhere else to live. Inez is correcting her first mistake, which was to move in with her boyfriend.

Now she needs to find a “roommate” (roommate). A “r oommate” is a person you live with, but someone with whom you don’t have any  romantic connection. Usually a roommate is a friend or another person wh o helps you pay for the rent and the expenses of your house or apartment. Carlos  says, “There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.” “To afford”  (afford) means to be able to pay for something, to have enough money to pay for something.

Inez says, “I know, but I really don’t want to live  with a stranger.” A “stranger” (stranger) is anyone you don’t know, anyone who is unknown to you – a person you may see on the street or in a store. If you don ’t know them, they are strangers. Inez says, “I have to put up with all of  their quirks.” “To put up with” something is to tolerate something, especially some thing that is difficult or unpleasant. To put up with a person or a situation is to have to get along with the person or to handle the situation even though it is n’t very pleasant, isn’t very nice.

Inez doesn’t want to put up with a stranger’s “quir ks” (quirks). A quirk is an unusual behavior or habit – something someone does that is uncommon and not usually done by most people. All of us have quirks,  things that we do that are different than most people. Carlos says, “I don’t t hink you have a choice. You need someone to split the rent and the cost of util ities, not to mention your cable bill.” “To split” (split) means to share – often, t o divide something into two equal parts.

If you are splitting the bill at a restaurant, each  of you is going to pay 50 percent of the bill. That’s normally how it works, but you could have a split that was 70 percent/30 percent. Carlos says Inez needs a roomma te “to split the rent.” The “rent” (rent) is the amount of money you pay to liv e in your home or in your apartment if you don’t own it. “Utilities” (utiliti es) is a general term referring to the electricity, the water, the gas, and other services  that are delivered to a home or business so that you can live or work there. These things are referred to in general as “utilities.”

Carlos also mentions Inez’s cable bill. Your “cable  (cable) bill” is the amount of money you have to pay in order to get cable televis ion into your home. Some people have satellite television as well, or instea d of cable television, usually. In either case, it’s an extra expense – more money you  have to pay every month.

Inez says, “I’d need someone who could keep the com mon areas neat and clean, and who can keep their hands off my stuff.” The “co mmon areas” in an apartment or a building are the areas that are shared with ot her people, that other people use. It’s often the case that two people who are ro ommates in an apartment will have their own bedrooms. However, the kitchen and t he living room are shared or common areas – areas both of them use.

Inez is worried about getting a roommate who is nea t and clean. “Neat” means orderly. “Tidy” (tidy), we might also say. “Clean” means the opposite of dirty. Inez wants someone who can also keep his hands off her s tuff. “To keep your hands off” someone’s things means to not touch it, especi ally something that is private, something that belongs to another person. “Keep you r hands off of my wallet” – don’t touch my wallet. It doesn’t belong to you – u nless you’re my wife, in which case everything belongs to you.

Carlos says, “I’m sure you’ll manage” – you’ll be a ble – “to find someone with those qualities,” with those characteristics. Inez says, “They’d have to help with chores around the apartment, too, and pitch in with  general upkeep.” “Chores” (chores) are tasks – things you have to do, usually  involving cleaning in a house.

There are lots of different chores, different thing s you have to do in your house in order to keep it clean. You have to wash the dishes , for example. You have to take out the garbage. Take your trash and leave it somewhere so it can be picked up. These are all chores. The word “chore” i s often used to describe an unpleasant task. I guess since most people think th at keeping their house clean isn’t a lot of fun.

Inez wants someone to “pitch in with general upkeep .” “To pitch in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to help with something, to con tribute by doing something. “I want everyone to pitch in and help me clean my r oom.” You’re asking other people to work with you, to help you. You can also use “pitch in” in a financial sense. “We’re all going to pitch in and buy our bos s a birthday present.” We’re all going to give money in order to buy the gift.

Inez wants someone to pitch in with the “general up keep.” “Upkeep” (upkeep) – one word – is another term for maintenance. Upkeep involves keeping things clean and in good condition. If they break, you fix  them. Usually the word “upkeep” is applied to some sort of property, such as a house or an apartment building. Carlos says, “No doubt there’s someone ou t there who wouldn’t mind doing that.” Carlos thinks that Inez can find a roo mmate like what she’s looking for. Inez says, “Hey, aren’t you looking for a plac e to live? You could move in here.” Inez is inviting Carlos to be her roommate.

Carlos says, “You mean share an apartment with you?  No, thanks.” Carlos is not interested. Inez says, “Why not?” Carlos says, “I’d  just rather not.” When you don’t want to give the reason why you don’t want to  do something – usually because you think the other person will get mad at you or will be offended – you can say something like, “I’d rather not.” “I’d just  rather not,” Carlos says. “I don’t think we’d suit.” “To suit” (suit) in this case mea ns to be appropriate for someone or something – to meet the requirements or needs of  someone.

Inez says, “Why wouldn’t we?” meaning “Why wouldn’t  we be suited for each other?” we could say. Carlos says, “Do you really want me to spell it out for you?” “To spell” (spell) normally means to give the lette rs of the words, like I do here on the podcast. “To spell it out,” however, means to s ay something explicitly and directly – to give a lot of details so there’s no p ossibility of the person misunderstanding you.

Carlos doesn’t want to give Inez a list of reasons why he should not be her roommate. He doesn’t want to offend her. He doesn’t  want to make her upset. That’s why he says, “Do you really want me to spell  it out for you?” Inez says,

“Yes, in fact, I insist.” “To insist” (insist) mean s to demand that something happen, to not accept any other alternatives.

Carlos then says, “All right. Let me just say that you’re a little bit grouchy in the mornings.” “To be grouchy” (grouchy) means to be in  a bad mood, to be unpleasant, often because you’re tired or you’ve ha d a bad day or perhaps you didn’t sleep well, if you’re grouchy in the morning . “You know that monster in the Alien  movies?” Carlos is asking Inez if she remembers the series of movies about an outer space monster, an outer space creatu re. Inez says, “Yes.”

And then Carlos says, “Ouch, ouch! Stop hitting me! ” What happened here, of course, is Inez is hitting Carlos because she’s ang ry at him. She feels insulted. But to be fair to Carlos, she did ask for him to sp ell it out, to give her the exact reasons why she would not be a good roommate for hi m.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos: Now that your boyfriend has moved out, you need a roommate. There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.

Inez: I know, but I really don’t want to live with a stranger. I’d have to put up with all of their quirks.

Carlos: I don’t think you have a choice. You need s omeone to split the rent and the cost of utilities, not to mention your cable bi ll.

Inez: I’d need someone who could keep the common ar eas neat and clean and who can keep their hands off my stuff.

Carlos: You mean share an apartment with you? No th anks.

Carlos: I’d just rather not. I don’t think we’d sui t.

Inez: Why wouldn’t we?

Carlos: Do you really want me to spell it out for y ou?

Inez: Yes, in fact, I insist.

Carlos: All right. Let’s just say that you’re a lit tle bit grouchy in the mornings. You know that monster in the Alien  movies?

This episode is a dialogue about riding motorcycles  and scooters. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bernadette: When you offered to give me a ride to w ork, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this.

Pawel: Come on, put on this helmet and get on. You’ ll get to work much faster. We can zip around cars and go between lanes.

Bernadette: That’s what I’m afraid of.

Pawel: I’m an experienced driver. I rode a moped wh en I was a teenager, had a scooter in college, and got my first bike when I wa s 22. I ride with my motorcycle club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry abou t safety.

Bernadette: I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one wrong move and I’m roadkill.

Pawel: Get on and I promise to behave. I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.

Bernadette: If that was intended to put my mind at ease, it didn’t work.

Pawel: All right, last call. You want a ride to wor k or not?

Bernadette: Okay, I’m putting my life in your hands . If I die, it’ll be on your conscience.

Pawel: No worries. If we wipe out, it’ll take us bo th out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my conscience. Hold on!

[end of dialogue]

Bernadette says to Pawel, “When you offered to give  me a ride to work, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this .” Bernadette is saying that Pawel had offered to give her a ride to work – to t ransport her to work. Now, normally if someone offers to give you a ride, the person has a car, but Pawel doesn’t have a car – he has a motorcycle. A “motorc ycle” is, you probably know, like a car, except it only has two wheels, like a b icycle. Bernadette says, “I’m not sure about this,” meaning she doesn’t know if she r eally wants to ride with Pawel on his motorcycle.

Pawel says, “Come on, put on this helmet and get on .” He’s saying to Bernadette, “Come and get on the bicycle.” Now in t he U.S., in many states you have to wear a helmet if you ride a motorcycle. A “ helmet” (helmet) is basically a thick, heavy hat that you wear over your head to pr otect it. Pawel says, “You’ll get to work much faster,” meaning you will get to w ork faster if you come on my motorcycle than if you, say, take a bus.

“We can zip around cars and go between lanes.” “To zip” (zip) means to move very quickly, especially to drive very quickly. Paw el also says that he can “go between lanes” (lanes). A “lane” is a space between  two lines on the road. You could have a road that has two lanes: one going in one direction, one going in the other direction. Or you could have a freeway that h as six, seven, or eight lanes. Some of the freeways here in Los Angeles are that b ig.

In California (and perhaps a few other states, I’m not sure), it’s legal for motorcycles to actually drive between two cars that  are next to each other. It’s absolutely crazy in my opinion, but nobody asked me  for my opinion. That’s the law. Motorcycles can go in between cars. In some st ates, probably in most states, this is illegal, but not here in California . Bernadette says, “That’s what I’m afraid of.” She’s scared about going in between car s, going between lanes, and zipping around cars.

Pawel says, “I’m an experienced driver,” meaning I’ ve been doing this a long time. “I rode a moped when I was a teenager.” A “mo ped” (moped) is basically a motorized bicycle. It’s sort of like a motorcycle, but it’s smaller and it’s not as fast as a motorcycle. We also learn that Pawel had a sco oter in college. A “scooter” (scooter) is a kind of motorcycle. The scooters usu ally have a, what’s called,

“platform” where the driver’s feet can go. It’s sor t of in between a moped and a motorcycle in terms of how heavy or powerful it is,  how fast it goes.

Pawel says, “I got my first bike when I was 22.” He re the word “bike” refers not to a bicycle that you use your legs to power, but rath er to mopeds, scooters, and motorcycles. Pawel says, “I ride with my motorcycle  club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry about safety.” A “motorcycle” i s the most powerful kind of two-wheeled vehicle, at least, that’s commonly used . We’ve talked about a moped and a scooter. The motorcycle would be sort of like the largest of those three bikes.

A “club” is an organization, a group of people who are typically interested in the same thing. Some people are members of motorcycle c lubs. Pawel says, “You don’t have to worry about safety” (about me hurting  you or hurting myself) because he practices, if you will, a lot with his m otorcycle club. Bernadette is not completely convinced.

She says, “I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one w rong move and I’m roadkill.” “Road (road)kill” refers to an animal that has been  hit by a car or a truck, usually on a freeway or street where cars and trucks are mo ving very fast. Roadkill happens, unfortunately. Sometimes animals come out into the lanes of traffic, onto the road, and sometimes they get hit and kille d. Bernadette is saying that if Pawel’s motorcycle has an accident, she would be ju st like roadkill – she would die and her body would be there on the road.

Pawel says, “Get on and I promise to behave.” “Get on” means get onto the motorcycle. Pawel says he promises “to behave” (beh ave). “To behave” is to act nicely – not to do anything crazy or dangerous. He says, “I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.” Pawel mentions a couple of dangerous things that you could do on a motorcycle. One of th em is “to pop (pop) a wheelie (wheelie).” “To pop a wheelie” is to perform a tric k where you are only riding on the back tire. The front tire, the front wheel, is up in the air so you’re basically on only one wheel. That’s “to pop a wheelie.”

We used to do that with our bicycles when we were k ids. We would try to pop a wheelie. Of course, you often end up falling off of  your bike and hurting yourself, which is why Pawel is saying he will not do that, b ecause that would be dangerous. He also promises not to “spin (spin) out .” “To spin out” is a phrasal verb that is used to describe what happens if your car or motorcycle suddenly starts to move in an uncontrollable way, often in c ircles.

If you are, for example, driving down a street that  has a lot of ice on it, and then you try to stop your car suddenly, your car could s pin out. You could spin in a circle on top of the ice. This is quite frequent. I  remember growing up in Minnesota, and when I learned to drive, having this  happen to me once or twice, so it can be a common occurrence – but it is a very  dangerous thing because, of course, you could hit someone else, as well as hurt  yourself.

Bernadette says, “If that was intended to put my mi nd at ease, it didn’t work.” Bernadette is saying that Pawel’s promise doesn’t r eally help convince her. It doesn’t put her mind at ease. “To put someone’s min d at ease” (ease) means to calm someone, to make someone feel relaxed and not worried. Bernadette says that Pawel’s promises not to pop a wheelie and spin  out do not put her mind at ease. She’s not relaxed.

Pawel says, “All right, last call.” “Last call” is sort of your last opportunity to do something. If you go to a bar at the end of the nig ht just before the bar is going to close, usually ten or fifteen minutes before the ba r will close, the bartender – the person working serving the drinks at the bar – will  say, “Last call,” meaning this is your last opportunity to get, in that case, a drink . This is Pawel’s last opportunity to convince Bernadette to get on his motorcycle.

He says, “You want a ride to work or not?” He’s say ing to Bernadette, “If you want me to give you a ride to work, then you have t o get on now. Otherwise, I’m going to leave.” Bernadette says, “Okay, I’m puttin g my life in your hands.” “To put your life in someone’s hands” means to do somet hing so that another person is in charge of or in control of your safety and se curity. If you go on an airplane, you put your lives in the hands of the pilots and t he airline company.

Bernadette says, “If I die, it will be on your cons cience.” The expression “to be on someone’s conscience” (conscience) means that you w ill feel guilty in the future if something bad happens. Your “conscience” is your  sense of right and wrong – your beliefs about what is right to do and what is wrong to do. If something is “on your conscience,” it’s bothering you. It’s somethin g that you feel bad about, something you feel guilty about, perhaps.

Pawel says, “No worries,” meaning don’t worry. “If we wipe out, it’ll take us both out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my cons cience.” Pawel makes an odd little joke here at the end. He tells Bernadette, “ If we wipe out, it’ll take us both out.” “To wipe (wipe) out” means to crash, especial ly if you are riding a bicycle, a motorcycle, or a skateboard. “To wipe out” means to  fall down and often to hurt yourself. Pawel says that if he and Bernadette wipe  out, that action will “take us both out.” “To take someone out” means to kill some one, to end someone’s life.

 Pawel says if they have an accident, both of them w ill die, and in that case, Pawel won’t be “conscious” (conscious) to worry abo ut his conscience. “To be conscious” means to be aware of something, especial ly aware of your surroundings – the things and people around you. If  you’re not conscious, you don’t have to worry about your conscience, since yo u are sort of like asleep. You aren’t aware of your surroundings, and so you’re no t thinking about the guilt you might feel, in this case, for killing your friend o r your workmate.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bernadette: When you offered to give me a ride to w ork, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this.

Pawel: Come on, put on this helmet and get on. You’ ll get to work much faster. We can zip around cars and go between lanes.

Bernadette: That’s what I’m afraid of.

Pawel: I’m an experienced driver. I rode a moped wh en I was a teenager, had a scooter in college, and got my first bike when I wa s 22. I ride with my motorcycle club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry abou t safety.

Bernadette: I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one wrong move and I’m roadkill.

Pawel: Get on and I promise to behave. I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.

Bernadette: If that was intended to put my mind at ease, it didn’t work.

Pawel: All right, last call. You want a ride to wor k or not?

Bernadette: Okay, I’m putting my life in your hands . If I die, it’ll be on your conscience.

Pawel: No worries. If we wipe out, it’ll take us bo th out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my conscience. Hold on!

# Finding Emerging Markets

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 1,056 – Finding Emerging Markets.   This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 1,056. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.   Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a member of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode.   My voice is a little strange today. I think I might be getting a cold. I’m not sure, but I hope you can still understand me. Today we’re going to talk about emerging markets in the business world. Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Jamie: If our company is going to grow, we need to find emerging markets. It makes sense to get a foothold in a few countries that may have developed markets within the next 20 years.  Nina: But there’s no guarantee that rapid growth in a country’s economy now will be sustainable years from now. I think it’s too much of a gamble myself.  Jamie: There are certainly no guarantees, but by the time it all shakes out and it’s clear which markets are the most promising, we will have missed the boat.  Nina: So what are you suggesting? Should we pick one or two markets to invest in, or hedge our bets and invest in several?  Jamie: I think we should identify the countries that have shown strong economic growth in the past 10 years and focus on those.   Nina: I still think it may be too risky, but I’m willing to consider the idea. Work up a proposal and I’ll look at it.   Jamie: You will? This is great. I didn’t think you’d be so receptive.  Nina: I’m not making any promises, but I’ll keep an open mind. Just make it short and sweet. # Storing Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,057 – Storing Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,057. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses in Business and Daily E nglish I’m sure you’ll enjoy.

On this episode, we learn all about how to keep – t hat is, how to store – food. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lee: Wow, what are we going to do with all these le ftovers?

Sarah: Let’s store them in different containers and  we can each take some to work to share. We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want it to go to waste.

Lee: Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers and san dwich bags for the cookies.

Sarah: Can you also grab some wax paper, too? We’ll  need to put some between each brownie so they don’t stick together.

Lee: We’re not going to have enough plastic contain ers. How about wrapping up some of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?

Sarah: Great idea. I think I have some freezer bags , too. We might as well freeze a couple of pieces of cake to eat later.

Lee: I wish we could vacuum seal them and store mor e pieces. That cake was really good!

Sarah: I know. I could eat three pieces in one sitt ing.

Lee: Hmm. On second thought, for the sake of our wa istlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue today is all about storing, or keeping , food. It begins with Lee saying to Sarah, “Wow, what are we going to do with  all these leftovers?” “Leftovers” (leftovers) refers to food that was ser ved at a meal, such as at dinner, but that nobody ate. Usually leftovers, if there is  a lot of food, are kept to be eaten later. Of course, you don’t want to throw awa y good food. So, leftovers would be food that was prepared for one meal, wasn’ t eaten, and is then stored to be eaten at a later time. “To store,” as a verb,  means to keep something to use in the future, to put away something to use later.

Sarah says, “Let’s store them,” meaning the leftove rs, “in different containers.” A “container” (container) is a box that is used to st ore something. You could have a plastic container, which is very common in kitchens  in the United States. Plastic containers are often used to store leftovers. Sarah  says, “We can take some to work to share.” She’s referring here to the leftove rs. They can take some of the leftovers to work in order to give to other people to eat. She says, “We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want  it to go to waste.”

“To go to waste” (waste) means that it will not be used and will therefore have to be thrown away. The word “waste” is often used to r efer to junk or garbage or simply something that you’re not going to use anymo re and that you are going to get rid of or throw way. “To let something go to wa ste” means to not eat something, in this case, or use something, and ther efore it will have to be thrown away because, of course, food won’t last forever. E ventually the food will change in such a way that you can no longer eat it.

Lee says, “Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers a nd sandwich bags for the cookies.” “Plastic” (plastic) is a material that we  use to make all sorts of things, including containers (I mentioned earlier about how  popular plastic containers are in American kitchens). Well, plastic is the materia l that is used for all sorts of things nowadays. It can be a soft material or it ca n be a very hard material. “Sandwich bags” are small plastic bags that are use d to put, well, sandwiches in, or small amounts of food.

You don’t have to put a sandwich in a sandwich bag.  You can put any sort of food inside of one. A sandwich bag is usually about  a half a quart, let’s say, in size. It’s not that big. Maybe three or four inches  by four or five inches, something like that. Sarah says, “Can you also grab some wax paper, too?” “Wax (wax) paper” is paper that has a little bit of wax on it that’s used for wrapping up food or for using especially with “baking” – when you cook food inside of an oven.

“Wax” is a substance that we normally associate wit h candles; most candles are made out of wax. But “wax paper” is a special kind of paper that is used either in cooking or in storing food. Sarah says, “We need to  put some” – meaning some wax paper – “between each brownie so they don’t sti ck together.” One common use of wax paper is to use it to separate different  pieces of food that you want to separate later on.

A “brownie” is a small chocolate sweet that is quit e popular with my wife, for example, made from typically sugar, butter, flour, and chocolate. Usually we use a little bit of egg when making a brownie as well. Lee says, “We’re not going to have enough plastic containers,” meaning we have mo re food than we have containers to store it in. “How about wrapping up s ome of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?”

“To wrap (wrap) up” is a two-word phrasal verb mean ing to package something, to put something in a container in order to either use it later or to move it from one place to another. If you give someone a gift, y ou usually wrap it with what is called “wrapping paper” (such as a birthday gift or  a gift for, say, Christmas). “To wrap up,” as a phrasal verb, means to put something  around the object – in this case, the food – in order to transport it or to sto re it.

Lee talks about two different kinds of materials th at could be used to wrap up food. The first is “Saran (Saran) wrap.” Saran wrap  is a thin, clear piece of plastic that is used for wrapping up food. The important th ing about Saran wrap is that it sticks very easily to plastic and to itself. So you  can put Saran wrap around something and it will stay wrapped – it won’t come apart like, for example, a piece of regular paper.

“Aluminum foil” (foil) is a thin piece of a flexibl e metal called “aluminum” – at least, it’s made with aluminum in it. Typically it’ s silver in color and is used, again, to wrap food up. Almost every American kitchen will  have both Saran wrap and aluminum foil for storing things, for wrapping thin gs up.

Sarah says, “Great idea. I think I have some freeze r bags, too.” A “freezer” (freezer) is a place where you keep things frozen, of course. That would be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. A “freezer bag” is a s pecial kind of plastic bag that usually is a little thicker than a sandwich bag and  a little bigger in size, but you can use to put food into and then store in the free zer.

Sarah says, “We might as well freeze a couple of pi eces of cake to eat later.” The expression “might as well” is used to make a sugges tion or to agree with another person’s suggestion, but not with a lot of exciteme nt or enthusiasm. You’re

saying, “Well, yes. We should do this,” but you’re not that excited about it. If you don’t do it, it won’t be a big deal. Sarah tells Le e that they “might as well freeze a couple pieces of cake to eat later.”

Lee says, “I wish we could vacuum seal them and sto re more pieces. That cake was really good.” “To vacuum (vacuum) seal” somethi ng is to put it in a special kind of plastic package, usually, and remove all or  most of the air from the package. This is often done with food in order to e nsure – to make sure – that it doesn’t spoil, that it keeps fresh, that you can us e it later on. Some people own special machine that will create vacuum seals aroun d food so that you can have a better system of storing it. I don’t have one, my self.

Sarah says, “I know,” agreeing with Lee’s assessmen t of the cake as being really good. “I could eat three pieces in one sitting.” Sa rah says the cake is so good that she could eat three parts of the cake, three p ieces of the cake, “in one sitting.” “In one sitting” (sitting) means at once,  or at one time without taking a break. Sarah is saying she could sit down and have one piece of cake and then another piece of cake and then another piece of cak e, all at one time.

Lee says, “Hmm,” indicating that he’s thinking abou t something. “On second thought” – thinking about it more carefully – “for the sake of our waistlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.” Lee is sa ying that maybe the suggestion of freezing more cake is not a good idea . Why? Because he’s worried about his and Sarah’s waistlines. Your “waist” (wai st) – notice the different spelling from an identically sounding word “waste,”  as in “to go to waste” – refers to a part of your body that is above your hips and below your ribs.

So basically, when you put on a pair of pants, the pants go up to your “waistline.” That’s the line that would indicate where your wais t is located. Usually when you are measuring your waistline, you are measuring a p art of your body that is just above your hips. Your “hips” are at the tops of you r legs – where your top of your body, what we would call your “torso” (torso), is j oined to your legs. That’s the waist area, and the waistline would be, in this cas e, an indication of how fat you are or how skinny you are.

If you’re worried about your waistline, you’re worr ied about getting too fat and gaining too much weight, and that’s what Lee is ref erring to. He’s saying that perhaps we shouldn’t keep this cake because if we e at it, we’ll become fat. And that, in fact, happens quite a bit when people eat too much cake, bread, pasta, sugar – all the good things in life.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Lee: Wow, what are we going to do with all these le ftovers?

Sarah: Let’s store them in different containers and  we can each take some to work to share. We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want it to go to waste.

Lee: Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers and san dwich bags for the cookies.

Sarah: Can you also grab some wax paper, too? We’ll  need to put some between each brownie so they don’t stick together.

Lee: We’re not going to have enough plastic contain ers. How about wrapping up some of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?

Sarah: Great idea. I think I have some freezer bags , too. We might as well freeze a couple of pieces of cake to eat later.

Lee: I wish we could vacuum seal them and store mor e pieces. That cake was really good!

Sarah: I know. I could eat three pieces in one sitt ing.

Lee: Hmm. On second thought, for the sake of our wa istlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.

# Preventing Binge Drinking

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,058 – Preventing Binge Drinking.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,058. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. When you’re there,  you can look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses in  Business and Daily English I think you might enjoy.

This episode is a dialogue about people who drink t oo much – too much alcohol, that is. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danielle: They’re at it again. Those college kids n ext door are having another kegger.

Nabil: That’s what we get for buying a house this c lose to a college. College students will have keggers and they’ll binge drink.  It’s a rite of passage.

Danielle: It’s dangerous to their health and a mena ce to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.

Nabil: There’s nothing we can do. If it gets out of  hand, we can call the cops, but let’s not overreact.

Danielle: I’m not overreacting. They’re college stu dents, so I’m going to teach them about the dangers of binge drinking.

Nabil: What are you going to do?

Danielle: I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pas s out flyers as people arrive. This flyer lists the many health reasons they shoul d moderate their drinking. It’s for their own good.

Nabil: And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?

Danielle: I won’t let them pass unless they agree t o drink responsibly.

 Nabil: I have a feeling we’ll see the cops tonight.

Danielle: You think the party will get out of hand?

Nabil: No, I think they’ll be here to arrest the cr azy lady waylaying people outside of their house!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Danielle saying to Nabil, “They’re at it again.” “To be at something again” means to be doing something again,  especially when we are referring to something that we don’t like. If you h ear your neighbors arguing with each other, you might say, “They’re at it again.” T hey’re arguing again. They’re doing something you don’t like again. In this case,  the problem is not people arguing, but college students drinking.

Danielle says, “Those college students next door,” meaning next to the house where we live, “are having another kegger.” A “kegg er” (kegger) is a party that has a lot of people and a lot of beer. The beer com es in a big barrel, a big container called a “keg” (keg). So, it’s very popul ar, especially among college students, to have parties where someone brings a bi g keg – a big barrel, basically – of beer. These parties are called “kegg ers.” Remember, in the U.S., the drinking age is 21 years old. However, this doe sn’t stop people under 21 from drinking, especially at parties such as keggers.

Nabil says, “That’s what we get for buying a house this close to a college.” “That’s what we get” means that is the logical nega tive consequence of something. If someone says to you, “You put on twen ty pounds” – you’ve gained twenty pounds – “That’s what you get for eating all  of that chocolate,” the idea is that the logical consequence of eating all of that chocolate is that you gain weight. The logical consequence of moving into a ho use that is close to a college or university is that you get student parties.

“College students,” Nabil continues, “will have keg gers and they’ll binge drink. It’s a rite of passage.” “To binge (binge) on” something  means to consume a lot of it. “To binge drink” would be to drink a lot of alcohol  in a short amount of time. “To binge watch” would be to watch a lot of television in a short amount of time. That expression “to binge watch” has become popular in t he last few years to refer to people who like to watch all of the episodes of a c ertain television series in a short amount of time, say over a single weekend.

“Rite (rite) of passage (passage)” refers to an eve nt or an activity that marks or indicates your movement or transition from one stag e to another. A rite of passage would be something that everyone goes throu gh at a certain age that indicates that they are growing older or that they are changing. Nabil is saying that having keggers is a rite of passage for colleg e students; it’s something that all college students do. Danielle says, however, “I t’s dangerous to their health and a menace to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.”

Danielle says that the binge drinking of her colleg e neighbors is a “menace” (menace) to the neighborhood. A menace is something  that is dangerous, scary, or threatening. There was an old television show ca lled “Dennis the Menace.” Dennis was a young child who was always getting int o trouble. Usually, however, “menace” has a little more negative meaning than ju st the trouble that a young boy would get into. When you say something is “mena cing,” you mean that it is threatening you in a very dangerous way.

Danielle thinks that the binge drinking of her coll ege neighbors is a menace to the neighborhood, and she’s going to “do something about it,” meaning she’s going to somehow try to stop it or change it. Nabil  says, “There is nothing we can do. If it gets out of hand, we can call the cops, b ut let’s not overreact.” When something “gets out of hand” (hand), it gets out of  control. It becomes too wild for anyone to control it and to limit the damage it mig ht cause.

If the party gets out of control, Nabil says they can call the cops. The “cops” (cops) are the police. The word “cop” is used infor mally to refer to a police officer. “Let’s not overreact,” Nabil says, however. “To ove rreact” (overreact) means to react to something too strongly – to act as if some thing is more important than it really is, especially when you are reacting in a ne gative way.

If your wife tells you that you need to wash the di shes tonight after dinner, and you start yelling and screaming about how you’re to o busy, that would be overreacting. That would be reacting in a negative way that the situation doesn’t require or doesn’t seem appropriate for. Danielle s ays, “I’m not overreacting. They’re college students, so I’m going to teach the m about the dangers of binge drinking.” Nabil says, “What are you going to do?” Danielle says, “I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pass out flyers as people arrive.”

The “sidewalk” is a narrow area along the side of t he road or the street where people walk up and down instead of walking in the s treet. Danielle is going to stand on the sidewalk near the house and pass out f lyers. “To pass out” is a two- word phrasal verb that here means to give to people , especially people who are walking by – to give them pieces of paper. A “flyer ” (flyer) is a piece of paper that

has information on it, usually about some political  cause, but sometimes just about information that the person passing it out th inks you should know.

Danielle’s flyer is going to list many health reaso ns, because of which students should moderate their drinking. “To moderate” (mode rate) here means to control the amount of something so that it isn’t too high. It isn’t too much or it isn’t too little or too low. Danielle wants the students to m oderate their drinking, meaning she doesn’t want them to stop drinking. She wants t hem to stop drinking too much. She says, “It’s for their own good.” The expr ession “for your own good” means it’s for your own benefit.

We often use this expression when you are telling s omeone to do something or to not do something when the person doesn’t agree w ith you that it’s a good thing or a bad thing to do. You think it’s good for them;  the person doesn’t agree with you. That would be a case where we would use this e xpression “It’s for your own good.” Parents, for example, use this expression wi th their children when the children, say, don’t want to brush their teeth or e at their vegetables. They may say to the child, “It’s for your own good” – you wi ll benefit from this. It is a good thing for you even if you don’t understand that.

Nabil says, “And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?” The expression “to give someone the time of d ay” doesn’t mean to tell someone the time right now. It means to pay attenti on to someone, to give someone the respect or courtesy that you might expe ct. If you don’t give someone the time of day, you’re not interested in t alking to that person. You’re not even interested in listening to that person. Na bil thinks that these college students will just ignore Danielle standing on the sidewalk passing out her flyers.

Danielle says, “I won’t let them pass until they ag ree to drink responsibly.” The verb “to pass” (pass) here means to move forward an d to go around something that is in your way. If you are walking down the st reet, and I stand right in front of you and I hold my arms out so that you cannot go by  me, I would not be allowing you to pass. If I allow you to pass, I move out of the way so you can continue moving forward, you can continue walking.

Danielle says she’s not going to let these students  pass, meaning she’s not going to let them go into the house, “until they agree to  drink responsibly.” “To drink responsibly” is to avoid drinking too much alcohol – to avoid drinking too much. Nabil says, “I have a feeling we’ll see the cops to night.” “I have a feeling” here means I predict, I expect. Danielle says, “Do you t hink the party will get out of hand?”

Nabil says, “No. I think they’ll be here to arrest the crazy lady waylaying people outside of their house.” Nabil is referring of cour se to Danielle herself. He’s saying the cops, the police, will show up because D anielle is trying to stop people from getting into the house. “To waylay” (waylay) –  one word – is to prevent someone from doing something – to stop someone, to interrupt someone. That’s what Danielle is thinking about doing with these bi nge-drinking college students.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Danielle: They’re at it again. Those college kids n ext door are having another kegger.

Nabil: That’s what we get for buying a house this c lose to a college. College students will have keggers and they’ll binge drink.  It’s a rite of passage.

Danielle: It’s dangerous to their health and a mena ce to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.

Nabil: There’s nothing we can do. If it gets out of  hand, we can call the cops, but let’s not overreact.

Danielle: I’m not overreacting. They’re college stu dents, so I’m going to teach them about the dangers of binge drinking.

Danielle: I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pas s out flyers as people arrive. This flyer lists the many health reasons they shoul d moderate their drinking. It’s for their own good.

Nabil: And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?

Nabil: I have a feeling we’ll see the cops tonight.

Danielle: You think the party will get out of hand?

Nabil: No, I think they’ll be here to arrest the cr azy lady waylaying people outside of their house!

# Feeling Restless and Jumpy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,059 – Feeling Restless and Jumpy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,059. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast; when you do, you can download the Learning Guides for all of  our current episodes.

This episode is all about describing someone who is  restless and jumpy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adam: Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like tha t!

Ellen: Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it. I’m just a little jittery.

Adam: Well, try to chill out. We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.

Ellen: I can’t help it. I’m like this because I had  a lot of coffee. That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.

Adam: But how can you study when you’re fidgeting a ll the time? Stop tapping your pen on the table!

Ellen: Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall a sleep, and tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one for me. I’ve got to do well.

Adam: I don’t see how you can get any studying done  when you’re strung out on caffeine. You’re so jumpy, and I think you’re start ing to twitch. Why don’t you try to counteract the caffeine by drinking lots of wate r?

Ellen: Do you know how long it took me to get this keyed up? I’m not doing anything to reduce the effects.

Adam: Fine.

Ellen: Hey, where are you going?

Adam: Anywhere but here!

[end of dialogue]

Adam and Ellen are college students. They are study ing for a test – they are preparing to take an examination. Adam says to Elle n, “Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like that!” When you tell someone to “sit still” (still), you are telling him to sit calmly, to sit without moving his arms or his l egs. Usually it’s something you would say to a young child – for example, at a rest aurant, when the child is moving around too much: “Sit still!” Adam is tellin g Ellen, however, to sit still.

He says, “Stop bouncing your leg like that!” “To bo unce” (bounce) something is to move it up and down, usually against the floor or s ome other flat area or surface. When you think of a basketball, for example, you im agine it bouncing up and down. It goes up and down between the hand and the floor. Ellen isn’t bouncing a ball. She’s bouncing her leg up and down against the floor, and Adam is telling her to stop it.

Ellen says, “Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it . I’m just a little jittery.” “To be jittery” (jittery) means to be nervous, to be unabl e to relax. Often when you’re jittery, your hands shake a little or your body mov es a little, almost involuntarily. Sometimes you’re jittery because you’re excited abo ut something. Sometimes you’re jittery because you’re nervous about somethi ng.

Adam says, “Well, try to chill out.” The phrasal ve rb “to chill (chill) out” means to relax, to stop worrying, to stop feeling depressed.  It’s an expression that was quite common 20, 30 years ago. I’m not sure how com mon it is today, but people still say it: “Chill out.” You don’t want to say th is to someone you don’t know well, however. You wouldn’t want to say it to your boss, for example. The expression has something of a criticism in its tone, and so it ’s something you would say to a friend, perhaps, or to your spouse or your children , but not something you would say to someone in authority over you.

Adam tells Ellen, however, to chill out. He says, “ We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.” “To be restl ess” (restless) means something similar to “to be jittery.” If you’re restless, you ’re moving around all the time because you’re nervous. “Restlessness” is just the noun that refers to the state of being restless. Adam is saying that Ellen’s restles sness “is distracting.” Something that is distracting is something that mak es it difficult for you to

concentrate or to focus on something. It takes your  attention away from where it should be.

Ellen says, however, “I can’t help it.” “I can’t he lp it” means I can’t stop myself from doing it; I can’t prevent it. “I’m like this,”  she says, “because I had a lot of coffee.” “To have a lot of coffee” is to drink a lo t of coffee. If you drink a lot of coffee, it may make you jittery because of a certai n chemical in the coffee called “caffeine.” Ellen says, “That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.” Ellen is saying the only way she can do an all-nighter is to drink a lot of coffee.

What’s an “all-nighter?” An “all (all) – nighter (n ighter)” is when you study all night long for a test the next day. At least, that’s the most common use of the term. We often use the verb “to pull” with “all-nighter.” “I ’m going to pull an all-nighter.” That means I’m going to study all night without sleeping  for a test the next day. Now, you could also pull an all-nighter to complete a re port or to complete a paper.

Generally speaking, pulling an all-nighter is not a  good idea if you are studying for a test, because you’ll be so tired the next day , you’ll probably perform worse on the test than you would have if you had simply s lept, even though you studied more. To pull an all-nighter to complete a paper pr obably doesn’t matter, since the idea is that once you complete the paper, you’r e done and you can go to sleep.

I’ve pulled an all-nighter only once in my academic  career. I remember it very well. I was writing a paper about the Battle of Ban nockburn in Scotland, one of the most famous battles between England and Scotlan d, and I had to get this paper completed by the next morning. So, I stayed u p all night typing, as one did, on my typewriter, since this was before the days of  computers. I did finish the paper and I got a pretty good grade on it, thank yo u very much. But that was the only time I ever pulled an all-nighter. Anyway, it all brings back memories.

Adam says, “But how can you study when you’re fidge ting all the time?” “To fidget” (fidget) means to make small, rapid or quic k movements repeatedly, possibly without even being aware of it. When you’r e nervous, for example, or jittery you might move your finger up and down, or your leg up and down, without noticing that you’re doing it – without being compl etely aware that you’re doing it. Adam can’t understand how Ellen can study when she’ s fidgeting all the time.

Then Adam says to her, “Stop tapping your pen on the table!” “To tap” (tap) something with your finger would be to hit it with your finger repeatedly. You can also tap on a wall, for example. You could use your  fist to hit the wall repeatedly. That’s “tapping.” Adam is telling Ellen to stop tap ping the pen on the table. Ellen

says, “Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall a sleep.” Ellen is saying there are one of two possibilities right now: either she fall s asleep or she gets worked up. “To be worked up” means to have a lot of energy, to  have a lot of nervousness or anxiety.

Ellen says, “Tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one  for me.” The phrase “make- or-break” means it’s something that is extremely im portant. It’s something that will decide whether you succeed or fail at somethin g. A make-or-break test would be one that would determine, for example, if you are going to pass a class or not. Ellen says, “I’ve got to do well,” meaning “I have to do well on the test.”

Adam says, “I don’t see how you can get any studyin g done when you’re strung out on caffeine.” “To be strung (strung) out” on so me substance or drug means to be affected in a very negative way, usually because  you’ve taken a lot of a certain drug. Ellen has drunk a lot of coffee, and therefore consumed a lot of “caffeine” (caffeine). “Caffeine” is the chemical s ubstance found in coffee, as well as other drinks, that can make you feel awake and e nergetic, but could also make you, if you drink too much of it, jittery and nervous.

Adam says to Ellen, “You’re so jumpy, and I think y ou’re starting to twitch.” “To be jumpy” (jumpy) means something similar to “to be  jittery.” It means to be nervous, to be anxious, to be moving around. “To tw itch” (twitch) means to move one part of your body very quickly and sometimes un controllably. When I have a bad allergic reaction – when my allergies are bothe ring me – sometimes my eye twitches. It moves involuntarily without me wanting  it to. (Technically, my eyelids twitch, not my actual eyes.)

Adam then says to Ellen, “Why don’t you try to coun teract the caffeine by drinking lots of water?” “To counteract” (counterac t) means to try to stop or prevent something else that is happening by doing s omething opposite of that, or to do something that somehow balances it out. If yo u start to get sleepy, you could counteract your sleepiness by drinking coffee  with caffeine in it. What Adam is suggesting here is that Ellen try to counte ract the effects of the caffeine by doing something else: by drinking a lot of water .

I’m not sure if drinking a lot of water counteracts  the effect of caffeine, but Adam seems to think so. Ellen says, “Do you know how lon g it took me to get this keyed up?” “To be keyed (keyed) up” is to be very e xcited or nervous or stressed. She says, “I’m not doing anything to redu ce the effects,” meaning, in this case, to make her less jumpy, less jittery. Ad am then says, “Fine,” meaning “okay.”

Ellen says, “Hey, where are you going?” Adam has st arted to get up and leave. Adam says, “Anywhere but here.” Adam doesn’t want t o stay with Ellen because she’s distracting him. That’s why he says, “Anywher e but here.” The use of the word “but” here means “except” – anywhere except he re, anywhere that isn’t here, if you will.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adam: Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like tha t!

Ellen: Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it. I’m just a little jittery.

Adam: Well, try to chill out. We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.

Ellen: I can’t help it. I’m like this because I had  a lot of coffee. That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.

Adam: But how can you study when you’re fidgeting a ll the time? Stop tapping your pen on the table!

Ellen: Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall a sleep, and tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one for me. I’ve got to do well.

Adam: I don’t see how you can get any studying done  when you’re strung out on caffeine. You’re so jumpy, and I think you’re start ing to twitch. Why don’t you try to counteract the caffeine by drinking lots of wate r?

Ellen: Do you know how long it took me to get this keyed up? I’m not doing anything to reduce the effects.

Adam: Fine.

Ellen: Hey, where are you going?

Adam: Anywhere but here!

# Disposing of Sensitive Documents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,060 – Disposing of Sensitive Documents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,060. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guides for our recent episode s. This episode is a dialogue between Marcus and Rebecca about disposing  of, or getting rid of, sensitive documents – pieces of paper or files that  have information you would not want other people to know. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcus: All right, let’s get started. These documen ts won’t sort themselves.

Rebecca: I really don’t think sorting through docum ents is the best use of my time. Can’t the company find an intern to do this?

Marcus: We have confidential information in these f iles, and unless we want a security breach, only people who are authorized to see it are allowed to do this job.

Rebecca: Lucky us.

Marcus: Okay, we need to purge these files of outda ted material. Let’s start by sorting them into two piles for either retention or  destruction.

Rebecca: And then what?

Marcus: Then we have to further sort the destructio n pile, either for disposal in the recycling bin or to be shredded.

Rebecca: And who are the lucky people who get to do  the shredding?

Marcus: We get that honor, too.

Rebecca: You’re kidding! I’m all for safeguarding c onfidential information, but couldn’t we just burn it all in a giant bonfire?

 Marcus: And who do you think would be responsible f or doing that, and for extinguishing the wildfire we start?

[end of dialogue]

Marcus begins our dialogue by saying to Rebecca, “A ll right, let’s get started.” “All right” here means, “Okay, let’s begin.” “These  documents won’t sort themselves.” “To sort” (sort) is to organize a grou p of items or things, dividing them into smaller groups or putting them in some so rt of order. For example, if you had a bunch of books, you could put the books i n alphabetical order. The books that begin with an “A” would go first, the bo oks that begin with a “B” would go second, and so forth.

You can sort things into many different kinds of or ders. This is what Marcus and Rebecca are doing, but they’re sorting “documents,”  which is a general term for either pieces of paper or possibly electronic files  on your computer. Rebecca says, “I really don’t think sorting through documen ts is the best use of my time.” Rebecca is saying that she’s an important person – she has more important things to do than this rather simple task, this rat her easy job of sorting documents.

“Can’t the company find an intern to do this?” she asks. An “intern” (intern) is a person, often a college student, who is working in a temporary position, usually receiving little or sometimes no pay, no money, in order to get experience in a particular job or a particular kind of job. An “int ernship” is a job where you work as an intern, either paid or unpaid (meaning you do n’t get any money).

Marcus says, “We have confidential information in t hese files, and unless we want a security breach, only people who are authori zed to see it are allowed to do this job.” “Confidential” (confidential) means i nformation that is secret or private or that you don’t want anyone else to have.  Marcus is saying that there is confidential information in these files, and “unles s we want a security breach,” only people who are supposed to see this informatio n should be allowed to sort the documents.

A “security (security) breach (breach)” is when you  have a – I guess we could describe it “break” in security, when somehow somet hing that is secret is no longer secret. Someone finds a way of getting that information. This is, as you know, a huge problem nowadays on the Internet. When  companies have a security breach, people – thieves – come in and ste al the information, often credit card numbers, from the company.

 So, security breaches are very serious, or at least  they can be very serious. That’s why Marcus is saying that we don’t want to l et just an intern get access to this confidential information. He says, “Only peopl e who are authorized to see it are allowed to do this job.” “To be authorized” (au thorized) means to be allowed, to be permitted, to have permission to do something . That’s the meaning of the term “authorized.”

Rebecca says, somewhat sarcastically – somewhat jok ingly – “Lucky us.” I say “sarcastically” because she doesn’t really believe that it’s lucky that she and Marcus have to do this sorting. She’s making a joke . To say something that has the opposite meaning is to use “sarcasm,” or to be “sarcastic.” Marcus says, “Okay, we need to purge these files of outdated mat erial.” “To purge” means to get rid of something, to throw something away. “Out dated” refers to something that is no longer current – something from the past , often something that no longer works or is no longer useful.

Marcus says, “Let’s start by sorting them” – meanin g the files – “into two piles for either retention or destruction.” A “pile” (pile) i s the same as a “stack” (stack), which is a group of things placed one on top of the  other. You could have a pile of papers on your desk like I have. I’m looking at a pile of papers that I have to look at. I don’t want to look at them, but it’s par t of my job.

Well, Marcus is dividing these documents into two p iles. One pile is for the files that they are going to keep, or retain. The word “r etention” (retention) comes from the verb “to retain,” meaning to keep something. the opposite, in this case, of “retention” is “destruction.” “Destruction” (destru ction) comes from the verb “to destroy” (destroy), which means to get rid of somet hing, to throw something out, possibly even to rip it up or to burn it.

Rebecca asks, “And then what?” What do we do after we put these documents into these two piles? Marcus says, “Then we have to  further sort the destruction pile either for disposal in the recycling bin or to  be shredded.” “Further” (further) means to do more of something, to continue doing so mething. In this case, they have to continue sorting the destruction pile into two groups: one for files that they will put in the recycling bin and another for files that need to be shredded.

“Recycling bins” (bins) are containers where you pu t usually paper that is going to be reprocessed. It’s going to be used again some how. You can dispose of documents in one of two ways. “To dispose” (dispose ) means to get rid of. You then get rid of the documents or dispose of them by  putting them in a recycling

bin where they’re not destroyed, Somebody could, for example, go into the recycling bin and read one of the documents, or you  can shred the document.

“To shred” (shred) is to rip the document up, the p iece of paper up into small little pieces so nobody can read what was on the piece of paper. We use this verb “to shred” when we’re talking about paper. A “shredder”  is a machine that shreds things. Rebecca says, “And who are the lucky people  who get to do the shredding?” “Shredding” is not a very interesting o r exciting job, so Rebecca is once again being sarcastic here when she says “luck y people.” She means just the opposite: “unfortunate people.”

Marcus says, “We get that honor, too.” An “honor” ( honor) is, in this case, a privilege – something that you are given because yo u’ve done something well, or in recognition of some accomplishment that you have . Once again, though, sarcasm is at work here. Marcus isn’t saying that t his is really an honor. He’s saying the opposite. Rebecca says, “You’re kidding, ” meaning “You’re joking.” “I’m all for safeguarding confidential information,  but couldn’t we just burn it all in a giant bonfire?” “To safeguard” (safeguard) – all one word – means to protect something, to keep something safe.

Rebecca is saying that she wants to keep this confi dential, secret information safe, but she doesn’t think that they have to go th rough and shred every single piece of paper. Instead, she proposes, or suggests,  another idea which is to burn the paper in a giant bonfire. A “bonfire” (bonfire)  is basically a large fire that’s outdoors, often in an area in the woods where the f ire won’t damage anything around it.

When I was a child growing up in Minnesota, especia lly out in the areas outside of the city, you would often see bonfires, especial ly in the fall, in the autumn – in September, October, and November. People would burn  the leaves from the trees in a giant bonfire. I think they don’t allow that anymore, or at least in most areas that’s not allowed. But that was certainly so mething that we did when we were growing up. Well, that’s what Rebecca wants to  do. She wants to create a big fire and just burn all of this paper.

Marcus says, “And who do you think would be respons ible for doing that and for extinguishing the wildfire we start?” Marcus is rem inding Rebecca that to create a bonfire would still be work, and more importantly, it would be dangerous. A “wildfire” (wildfire) is a very large fire that bur ns through a forest or other areas in ways that you can’t control very easily. We have wi ldfires here in California – Southern California – quite frequently, and many ti mes these fires burn down homes. They can be quite dangerous.

 What do you do with a wildfire? Well, you have to p ut the fire out, and the verb we use for that concept is “to extinguish” (extingu ish). “To extinguish a fire” means to make the fire stop burning – “to put the f ire out,” we would say. Marcus is reminding Rebecca that if they create a bonfire,  they’ll probably start a wildfire, and then they would have to put the fire out. So, i t wouldn’t really save them very much.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marcus: All right, let’s get started. These documen ts won’t sort themselves.

Rebecca: I really don’t think sorting through docum ents is the best use of my time. Can’t the company find an intern to do this?

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,061 – Shopping for Men’s Shoes.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Curran and Beth about buying shoes for a man. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Curran: I like these tennis shoes. I need a new pai r.

Beth: We’re here to buy you some dress shoes for at tending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers, and yo u need time to break them in.

Curran: All right. Just pick whatever you think is suitable and let’s go.

Beth: Don’t you want to have a say in what you wear ? I think these oxfords are nice. What do you think?

Curran: Great. I’m a size 10 and a half. I’ll try t hem on and we’ll go.

Beth: You can’t just buy the first pair of shoes yo u see. How about these?

Curran: Those patent leather shoes? They have purpl e laces. Well, if you think they’re okay . . .

Beth: No, they’re not. These shoes are totally wron g for the occasion, not to mention hideous. I was just trying to get a rise ou t of you so you’ll pick the shoes you like.

Curran: But I don’t care what I wear. Just pick a p air.

 Beth: No, you pick.

Curran: Fine. How about these?

Beth: No, they’re not dressy enough. They look more  like sandals than dress shoes.

Curran: Then how about these?

Beth: Those boots? Definitely not.

Curran: Okay, these then.

Beth: Those shoes fasten with Velcro. Are you kiddi ng me?

Curran: Okay, why don’t you just tell me what my ta ste should be and I’ll buy what you want me to buy?

Beth: And leave you with no say in your own purchas e? What kind of cousin would I be if I did that?

[end of dialogue]

Curran begins our dialogue by saying to Beth, “I li ke these tennis shoes. I need a new pair.” Beth and Curran are out shopping for, or  looking to buy, some shoes for Curran. Curran says he likes these “tennis shoe s.” “Tennis shoes” are sometimes called “athletic shoes,” or in some parts  of the U.S., “gym shoes.” Basically they are comfortable shoes that are worn for playing many different kinds of sports, as well as for running.

Beth, however, says, “We’re here to buy you some dr ess shoes for attending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn- out loafers, and you need time to break them in.” “Dress (dress) shoes” are n ice-looking shoes. Shoes that, I guess you could say, a woman would wear with a dr ess. However, we use the term “dress shoes” for both men and women to descri be a very nice pair of shoes – shoes you could wear to a formal event.

Beth and Curran are there at the shoe store to buy Curran some dress shoes for attending, or going to, a wedding – Chelsey’s weddi ng. Beth says, “You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers.” When we say someth ing is “worn (worn) out,” we mean it’s old and it looks old. Often we use thi s expression for things that you

can no longer use, or no longer work properly, or a re no longer appropriate for certain things.

Beth is saying that Curran’s loafers are worn out. “Loafers” (loafers) are leather shoes that have a flat bottom to them – what we wou ld call a “flat heel,” which is the back bottom of a shoe – that are considered som ewhat informal. Usually loafers don’t have little strings that you use to t ighten the shoe in front. We call those little strings “shoelaces.” Loafers don’t hav e shoelaces, so they’re very easy to put on and take off.

Beth says that Curran is going to need time “to bre ak them in.” “Them” here refers to the new shoes. But what does it mean to b reak in new shoes? “To break in” here means to wear something, especially shoes,  for a while so that they’re comfortable. As you probably know, when you buy a n ew pair of shoes, sometimes it takes a while for your feet to get com fortable in the shoe itself so that the shoe feels good and is easy to wear.

“To break in shoes,” then, is to wear these shoes u sually for a little bit of time every day until you can wear the shoes without any discomfort. “To break in” as a phrasal verb has a very different meaning in Englis h as well, which is to steal – to go in, usually to a house or to a building, and to steal things, to rob things from that place. But here it’s not used to refer to anyo ne stealing anything, but rather to wear shoes until they are comfortable.

Curran says, “All right. Just pick whatever you thi nk is suitable and let’s go.” Curran is telling Beth that she should pick somethi ng that she likes and that’s what Curran will buy. Beth says, “Don’t you want to  have a say in what you wear?” “To have a say in” something is to have an o pinion – to express, more importantly, your opinion and be part of the decisi on. Beth is surprised that Curran wants her to pick his shoes.

She then says, “I think these oxfords are nice.” “O xfords” (oxfords) are leather shoes with a very simple shape that have shoelaces on top of them, but not all the way down to the toes. You may be confused becau se the word “Oxford” is usually used to describe a famous university in Eng land, but here it’s used to describe a kind of shoe. If you look up “oxfords” w ith an “s” at the end in a dictionary, you’ll see the definition of this kind of shoe.

Beth says, “What do you think?” “Do you like the sh oes?” she’s asking Curran. Curran says, “Great. I’m a size 10 and a half. I’ll  try them on and we’ll go.” Curran just wants to try on the shoes and leave. Beth says , “You can’t just buy the first pair of shoes you see. How about these?” Beth wants  Curran to look at more

shoes, different kinds of shoes, before he makes a decision. She shows him another pair of shoes.

Curran says, “Those patent leather shoes?” “Patent (patent) leather” is a very shiny leather that’s often used for shoes and for p urses that women, for example, would typically wear – small bags that a woman woul d have to put all of the things that women have that they want to take with them. Patent leather is a popular material for shoes. Curran, however, is not  quite sure about this pair of shoes that Beth is suggesting.

He says, “They have purple laces.” “Laces” (laces) refers to shoelaces – the string or cord that we use on the top front part of  the shoe to tighten it, to make sure that your foot stays in the shoe. Curran says,  “Well, if you think they’re okay . . .” Beth then replies, “No, they’re not.” She’s testing Curran, I guess, trying to get Curran to see that he has to take this decision  seriously, so she suggests a pair of shoes that are clearly not appropriate for a wedding.

She says, “These shoes are totally wrong” – meaning  completely wrong – “for the occasion,” for the event, “not to mention hideous.”  “Hideous” (hideous) means horrible – in this case, horrible looking, terrible  looking. Something that’s really ugly would be hideous. Beth says these shoes are hi deous. She uses the expression “not to mention” (mention). “Not to ment ion” is a common phrase in conversational English that is used to place emphas is on something, especially when we are listing reasons for something.

For example, someone may ask you to go out to dinne r at a restaurant, but you can’t go, and so you start telling the person why y ou can’t go. “Well,” you say to the person, “I need to do my homework, and my broth er is coming to visit, not to mention I also have to wash my clothes tonight.” Yo u’re giving the person different reasons, and then you’re emphasizing one of those reasons. That’s how we would use “not to mention.”

Beth says, “I was just trying to get a rise out of you so you’ll pick the shoes you like.” “To get a rise (rise) out of” someone is to make someone react – especially in anger, or perhaps in annoyance – usually because  you think that reaction is going to be funny or entertaining. When you try to get a rise out of someone, you’re trying to get the person angry, but for a fu nny reason or a funny purpose – at least, you think it’s funny. Curran says, “But I  don’t care what I wear. Just pick a pair.”

Curran is telling Beth to pick a pair of shoes for him. Beth says, “No, you pick.” Curran says, “Fine. How about these?” Beth says, “N o, they’re not dressy

enough.” “Dressy” here means formal. “They look mor e like sandals than dress shoes.” “Sandals” (sandals) are shoes typically wor n in warm weather that are not a complete shoe. Sandals are usually open in the back, or at least part of the foot is exposed, so you can see a lot of the skin o n your feet.

You can wear socks over your feet with sandals, but  they’re most commonly worn without socks. They’re usually found at the be ach, for example. They’re not appropriate for a formal event like a wedding. Curr an says, “Then how about these?” Beth says, “Those boots? Definitely not.” B oots” (boots) are very tall or high shoes that come up high on your leg. Boots, on ce again, are not considered formal shoes, and therefore not appropriate for a w edding. Curran says, “Okay, these then.”

Beth says, “Those shoes fasten with Velcro. Are you  kidding me?” “To fasten” (fasten) means to connect something together, usual ly with a button or some other small device on the cloth itself like a “snap ” (snap). “Velcro” (Velcro) is a plastic material that you are able to put together so that it stays; you don’t have to tie it. The two parts of the Velcro hook together a nd are able to keep something together – to hold something together or to connect  something together. There are some shoes that instead of shoelaces have Velcr o on them. But once again, those shoes are not appropriate for a wedding.

Curran says, “Okay, why don’t you just tell me what  my taste should be and I’ll buy what you want me to buy.” Curran is telling Bet h that she needs to tell him what his taste should be. “Taste” (taste) here refe rs to the kinds of things that you like. You can talk about your “taste in food” or yo ur “taste in clothing.” It doesn’t refer necessarily to something you eat. That’s also  the use of the verb “to taste” – to put something in your mouth and to get a sense of the flavor of the food.

But it means much more generally the kinds of thing s that you like. It could refer to any kind of object or activity that you like. Cu rran is telling Beth, “Just tell me what you like” – what you think I should buy – “and  I’ll buy it.” Beth, however, says, “And leave you with no say in your own purcha se? What kind of cousin would I be if I did that?” Beth, even though she do esn’t like anything that Curran has selected, does not want to tell Curran what to buy.

That’s why she says, “And leave you with no say in your own purchase?” – in the thing that you are about to buy. “What kind of cous in,” she asks, “would I be if I did that?” Your “cousin” (cousin) refers to the son  or daughter of either your aunt or your uncle. Your “aunt” is your mother or father ’s sister. Your “uncle” is your mother or father’s brother. So, it’s the child of o ne of your aunts or uncles.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Curran: I like these tennis shoes. I need a new pai r.

Beth: We’re here to buy you some dress shoes for at tending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers, and yo u need time to break them in.

Curran: All right. Just pick whatever you think is suitable and let’s go.

Beth: Don’t you want to have a say in what you wear ? I think these oxfords are nice. What do you think?

Alex: This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking, is  it? Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become in volved in a relationship.

Iris: He’s not a confirmed bachelor. In this neighb orhood, with so many single women, he’s an eligible bachelor.

Alex: You mean in this neighborhood full of old spi nsters! Stop trying to set him up with one of them.

Iris: How do you know he doesn’t want a relationshi p? Maybe he’s just shy and needs a little prodding. Maybe he has a fear of com mitment and we can all help him overcome it.

Alex: Maybe he just wants to be left alone by meddl ing neighbors and ladies on the prowl. There are many benefits to remaining a b achelor.

Iris: You mean living a celibate and empty life?

Alex: You’re making too many assumptions. You don’t  know the first thing about his life and whether he’s happy or not. In many way s, a bachelor’s life is idyllic.

Iris: How can you say that?

Alex: Would any bachelor have to have this conversa tion with anyone, ever?

[end of dialogue]

We’re listening to a conversation between Iris and Alex. Iris begins by saying, “I’m thinking of inviting Simone and Jerry over for  dinner.” Alex says, “This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking is it?” Iris wants t o invite a couple of friends over to have dinner, but Alex suspects – he thinks – tha t what she’s really doing is trying to be a matchmaker.

“To matchmake” (matchmake) means to try to introduc e one person – one single person, one unmarried person – to another person th at you think they might like. So, this is what “matchmaking” is, and in some cult ures there are matchmakers who help arrange marriages, help young people find each other. This is done, of course, informally in all cultures. Your parents tr y to introduce you to a nice girl or a nice boy that they think you may want to marry.

Alex says, “Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become involved in a relationship.” One of the two people that Iris wants to invite to dinner is Jerry. But according to Alex, Jerry is  a “confirmed bachelor.” A “bachelor” (bachelor) is a man who is not married a nd typically is not in involved in a romantic relationship – one who chooses to liv e alone. A “confirmed bachelor” would be a man who has probably decided h e’s never going to marry.

Iris says, “He’s not a confirmed bachelor,” referri ng to Jerry, of course. “In this neighborhood, with so many single women, he’s an el igible bachelor.” The term “eligible (eligible) bachelor” refers to a man who is not in a relationship, who is not married but would be a desirable partner – some one who a woman would want to marry, perhaps because he has a lot of mone y and/or he’s good-looking. I was neither of those things when I got married. I ’m still neither of those things.

Alex says, “You mean in this neighborhood full of old spinsters!” Alex uses the word “spinsters” (spinsters) to describe older unma rried women who are considered by some too old to get married. The word  “spinster” is a very negative way of describing an older unmarried woman. I certa inly would not recommend using that term, but it was popular many years ago.  Alex is using it as an insult here. He’s insulting the women who live in that nei ghborhood, saying that they would not be good matches for Jerry.

Alex says to Iris, “Stop trying to set him up with one of them.” “To set someone up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to arrange f or someone to meet a potential romantic partner. It’s similar to matchma king. To set someone up is to try to get someone to go out on a date with another  person when you think the two people might be interested romantically in each  other.

I was set up once for a date, what we would call in  this instance a “blind (blind) date.” A blind date is when you don’t know the othe r person, but you both know someone who sets you up, who arranges for you to go  on a date. I did this once and it didn’t work out very well. My father and mot her, however, met on a blind date, and they had 11 children, so sometimes it wor ks. Just not for me.

Alex is telling Iris that she should stop trying to  set Jerry up with these women. Iris says, “How do you know he doesn’t want a relat ionship? Maybe he” – Jerry – “he’s just shy and needs a little prodding.” “To pr od (prod) someone” is to encourage someone to do something, to sort of push them to do something. Iris says, “Maybe he has a fear of commitment and we can  all help him overcome it.”

A “fear of commitment” is a feeling of worry and an xiety when you think about, in this case, spending your entire life with another p erson. You might decide that you are too afraid to get married, to be in a long- term romantic relationship. That’s a fear of commitment. The word “commitment” comes from the verb “to commit,” which means to promise to do something, to  agree to do something. A fear of commitment would be the opposite – that you  don’t want to commit to anyone. Iris thinks that she and Alex can help Jerr y to overcome his fear of commitment.

“To overcome” (overcome) means to deal with a diffi cult problem or to solve a difficult problem, especially after a very long tim e of being challenged by the problem. There was a famous song of the civil right s movement in the 1960s in the United States, “We Shall Overcome,” meaning we will eventually solve this problem. We will eventually be able to, in the case  of the African-American community in the United States, be free of the disc rimination that they were experiencing at that time.

But the verb “to overcome” can be used in any circu mstance where you have a very difficult situation, one that is perhaps long- lasting, where you eventually succeed. You solve the problem or get over the prob lem. Alex says, “Maybe he just wants to be left alone by meddling neighbors a nd ladies on the prowl.” “Meddling” (meddling) means being involved in other  people’s private affairs, especially when those people don’t want this person  involved in their affairs. “To

meddle” as a verb means to get involved in things, especially private matters that don’t concern you, that you shouldn’t be involved i n.

That’s what Alex thinks Iris is doing. He’s meddlin g in the personal affairs of Jerry. He says that he thinks Jerry “just wants to be left alone by meddling neighbors,” meaning he doesn’t want people botherin g him in this way. He also wants to be left alone by “ladies on the prowl” (pr owl). “To be on the prowl” means to be looking for something, searching for so mething. It’s often used in the dating world, if we could call it that, to refe r to someone who is looking for a romantic or sexual partner.

Alex says, “There are many benefits” – many good th ings – “to remaining a bachelor.” Iris says, “You mean living a celibate a nd empty life?” “Celibate” (celibate) means deciding not to have sexual relati ons with another person – often, but not always, for religious reasons. Iris obviously thinks that being celibate means having an empty life. This is rather  a prejudiced opinion on Iris’s part, but I suppose some people do think that.

Alex says, “You’re making too many assumptions.” “A ssumptions” (assumptions) are things that you believe to be true even though you often don’t have any proof or evidence that they are true. Alex says, “You don ’t know the first thing about his life.” “To not know the first thing” about someone is to be completely unfamiliar with someone or something. I could say, “I don’t kn ow the first thing about repairing or fixing my computer.” I don’t know what  to do. I’m completely ignorant. That would be a true statement.

Alex says, “In many ways, a bachelor’s life is idyl lic.” “Idyllic” (idyllic) means perfect, very happy, enjoyable. To say the bachelor  life is “idyllic” is to describe it as though it were the best situation you could be i n, and that’s what Alex is saying. Iris is puzzled. She doesn’t agree. She say s, “How can you say that?” meaning “How is it possible for you to think that w ay? What are your reasons for thinking that way?”

Alex says, “Would any bachelor have to have this co nversation with anyone, ever?” What Alex is saying here in the last line of  the dialogue is that the very fact that he has to have this conversation with his  wife is an indication of the good side of being a bachelor – in other words, he wouldn’t have to argue with his wife if he were a bachelor, and bachelors don’t  have to argue with anyone because they don’t have anyone to argue with. In so me ways, Alex is perhaps making a joke here, since he and Iris are married.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Iris: I’m thinking of inviting Simone and Jerry ove r for dinner.

Alex: This isn’t another attempt at matchmaking, is  it? Jerry is a confirmed bachelor and he’s not looking to marry or become in volved in a relationship.

Iris: He’s not a confirmed bachelor. In this neighb orhood, with so many single women, he’s an eligible bachelor.

Alex: You mean in this neighborhood full of old spi nsters! Stop trying to set him up with one of them.

Iris: How do you know he doesn’t want a relationshi p? Maybe he’s just shy and needs a little prodding. Maybe he has a fear of com mitment and we can all help him overcome it.

Iris: How can you say that?

# Preparing for a New Baby

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,063 – Preparing for a New Baby.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,063. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses in Business and Daily E nglish just for you.

This episode is a dialogue between Wanda and Enriqu e about someone who is expecting a new baby – a mother who is about to giv e birth to a new baby. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wanda: Oh hi, I wasn’t expecting you today.

Enrique: We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and yo ur sister said I should come by with a few things for your baby.

Wanda: That’s really sweet of you guys, but I’m not  due for another six months.

Enrique: But you’ll need these things to get the ba by’s room ready, right?

Wanda: Well, we don’t actually have a baby room set  up yet.

Enrique: There’s no time like the present. Here’s a  crib and the mattress. It just needs to be assembled. Oh, here are some bumper pad s that go with it.

Wanda: Great.

Enrique: Here’s a changing table.

Wanda: Wow, that’s really big.

Enrique: Here are two car seats, one for infants an d one for toddlers, and here’s a booster seat.

Wanda: That’s a lot of stuff. Are you sure you want  to part with all this?

 Enrique: Positive. Here’s a basic baby monitor and a video monitor so you can keep tabs on the little one.

Wanda: Whoa, what’s in all these bags?

Enrique: They’re baby and kids clothes. You’ll need  more than you think.

Wanda: That’s really generous of both of you, but a re you sure you want to give it all to me?

Enrique: Of course, you’re family and this will hel p you save a lot of money.

Wanda: And it’ll free up garage space for your new workshop?

Enrique: Well, why not kill two birds with one ston e?

[end of dialogue]

Wanda begins our dialogue by saying to Enrique, “Oh  hi, I wasn’t expecting you today” – I didn’t think you were coming today. Enri que says, “We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and your sister said I sho uld come by with a few things for your baby.” “To clean out” means to clean compl etely or thoroughly. A “garage” is a place where you normally store your c ar, although many people use it to store other things, and that’s the case with Enrique and his wife. They have cleaned out their garage and are bringing some thin gs for Wanda.

Wanda says, “That’s really sweet of you guys.” The word “sweet” here means nice or kind. “But,” Wanda continues, “I’m not due for another six months.” When we talk about when a mother is “due” (due), we mean  when she expects to give birth to the baby. Enrique says, “But you’ll need t hese things to get the baby’s room ready, right?” Enrique is saying well, yes it’ s six months, but you still need to get the room where the baby will be staying prep ared and ready.

Wanda says, “Well, we don’t actually have a baby ro om set up yet.” “To set up” means to prepare, usually involving perhaps moving furniture around, in this case, or perhaps putting a place for the baby to sl eep. That would be “setting up” a baby room. Enrique says, “There’s no time like the present.” This is an old expression – a cliché, really. “No time like the pr esent” (present). It means that you should take advantage of an opportunity to do s omething immediately, right away, without waiting.

Enrique says, “Here’s a crib and the mattress.” A “ crib” (crib) is a special place where babies sleep. It’s a bed that has high sides to it, almost like walls, that prevent the baby from falling out. A “mattress” (ma ttress) is a soft, comfortable surface that you sleep on. Enrique says to Wanda, “ Here’s a crib and the mattress,” meaning the mattress that goes with the crib or inside of the crib.

He says, “It just needs to be assembled.” “To assem ble” (assemble) means to put something together, especially when there are a  lot of small parts. Many people buy furniture at a store such as IKEA, and w hen they bring it home, they have to assemble the furniture. This of course is s ometimes almost impossible, in the same way that assembling children’s toys is som etimes impossible. But we hope it won’t be impossible for Wanda to assemble t his crib.

Enrique continues, “Oh, here are some bumper pads t hat go with it.” “Bumper (bumper) pads (pads)” are cushions – soft material – that are placed against the walls of the cribs so that the baby doesn’t hit his  or her head against the side of the crib. It’s sort of like a mattress, but it’s ve rtical so the baby doesn’t hit his or her head against the side of the crib and hurt him or herself.

Wanda says, “Great.” She means, “That’s wonderful. I’m very happy.” Enrique then says, “Here’s a changing table.” A “changing t able” would be a special table that you use, on which you put the baby when you are changing the baby’s clothes – in particular changing the baby’s diapers , which is the part of the clothes the baby wears around its middle, because of course babies don’t get up and use the bathroom the way the rest of us do. I w ish they did.

Wanda says, “Wow, that’s really big.” She’s referri ng to the changing table. Enrique, however, just continues on giving her thin gs. He says, “Here are two car seats, one for infants and one for toddlers, and he re’s a booster seat.” A “car seat” is a general term used to describe a special chair that you use in a car, into which you put a baby or young child.

In the United States – in most states, perhaps in a ll states – you must put a baby or a small child in a car seat. You can’t just hold  the baby in your arms, for example. That’s against the law. The idea is, of co urse, to protect the baby or the small child should there be an accident. There are two kinds of car seats mentioned here. One is for “infants” (infants) and one is for “toddlers” (toddlers). An “infant” is a small baby, a very young baby. A “ toddler” is a young child, usually one who has already learned how to walk. Th ose are the most dangerous kind.

So, there are car seats for infants. There are bigg er car seats for toddlers. Enrique also gives Wanda a “booster (booster) seat. ” A booster seat is a special seat – or small chair, I guess you could think of i t as – that is used to keep a child, an older child, safe in a car by lifting his  or her body high enough so that the seat belt crosses the body at the appropriate h eight. A “seat belt” is a special piece of material, a strap, that you put over your body to prevent your body from being thrown out of the car in case of an accident.

So, for older children who are too old for a car se at, there are booster seats that the older children can have underneath them. Wanda says, “That’s a lot of stuff” – that’s a lot of things. “Are you sure you want to  part with all of this?” “To part with” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get rid of something, to give something away, especially something that migh t have some sort of emotional or sentimental value, something that you like a lot.

Wanda asks Enrique if he’s sure that he wants to pa rt with all of these things. Some parents, for example, like to keep all of the things that they used for their baby for many years. My mother never did that. Ther e was always another baby that needed to use it. Although, I was the youngest , so I guess she got rid of it after me. Enrique says, “Positive,” meaning yes, he ’s absolutely sure he wants to part with this stuff.

He continues, “Here’s a basic baby monitor and a vi deo monitor so you can keep tabs on the little one.” A “baby monitor” is a smal l electronic device, one part of which is in the room where the baby is sleeping and  the other is usually in the parents’ bedroom. You can hear the baby, so if the baby makes noise or wakes up, you can hear it on the baby monitor. It’s like a little radio between one room of the house and another room of the house, or that  connects the two rooms together.

A “video monitor” would be the same sort of thing e xcept it’s actually a video camera, and you can look and see your baby from ano ther room. You use these “to keep tabs on” your baby. “To keep tabs (tabs) o n” someone is to monitor someone or, we might say, to keep track of someone – to get information on someone so you know how he or she is doing. Wanda s ays, “Whoa, what’s in all these bags?” Enrique says, “They’re baby and kids c lothes.” You’ll need more than you think.

Wanda says, “That’s really generous of both of you,  but are you sure you want to give it all to me?” Enrique says, “Of course, you’r e family,” meaning you’re part of our family (I’m guessing that Enrique is married to  Wanda’s sister here). He says, “This will help you save a lot of money.” But Wanda  sees that there’s another

reason that Enrique is giving her all of these thin gs, and she tells us at the end of the dialogue. She says, “And it will free up garage  space for your new workshop?”

“To free up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make something available, especially space or time. You can talk about “freei ng up your schedule,” meaning canceling some of your appointments or arranging th ings so that you have time to do something special. A “workshop” (workshop) is  a room or an area in a room where you build or fix things. Some people have a “ wood workshop” in their garage where they cut wood and do things with wood.  I don’t have any of these sorts of things in my house.

Enrique says, “Well, why not kill two birds with on e stone?” Enrique is saying yes, I am also trying to make room for my workshop, and that’s why I’m giving you all of this stuff. He uses an old expression, “to kill two birds with one stone.” This means to solve two problems at once, with one actio n. If you can imagine a stone, a small rock, being thrown up into the air a nd killing not just one bird but two birds, then you get the idea that you can use o ne action in order to accomplish two different things or to achieve two d ifferent purposes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Wanda: Oh hi, I wasn’t expecting you today.

Enrique: We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and yo ur sister said I should come by with a few things for your baby.

# Spotting Trends

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,064 – Spotting Trends.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,064. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Visit our websit e at ESLPod.com.

Become a member of ESL Podcast and download the Lea rning Guide for this episode. This episode is a dialogue between Heidi a nd Tim about understanding the way things are changing in the world by spottin g trends. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Heidi: You look very relaxed reading magazines in t he middle of the workday.

Tim: It’s my job. I’m tasked with spotting new tren ds.

Heidi: And you do that by reading magazines with yo ur feet up?

Tim: Why not? I also frequent places where hipsters  hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, e ating, drinking, and doing.

Heidi: That doesn’t sound too onerous.

Tim: It’s all about finding the trendsetters, the p eople who are beta testers and early adopters. These are also the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course.

Heidi: Can’t you just see what people are buying?

Tim: By then, it’s too late. Those are people who a re jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers.

Heidi: Well, don’t look at me. I lag behind every t rend and don’t have any idea what’s in or out.

Tim: Luckily, you have me to tell you. I’ve been me aning to talk to you about your choice of footwear . . .

[end of dialogue]

 Heidi begins our dialogue by saying to Tim, “You lo ok very relaxed reading magazines in the middle of the workday.” Heidi is s aying to Tim that he seems very relaxed, very calm, but you can kind of guess that she’s wondering why Tim is reading a magazine instead of working. That’s wh y she says “in the middle of the workday.” The “workday” is a day that you would  normally expect to work. For most of us, that’s Monday through Friday.

Tim says, however, “It’s my job” – in other words, reading magazines is his work. He says, “I’m tasked with spotting new trends.” A c ouple of interesting words and phrases there. Let’s start with the verb “to be tas ked (tasked) with” something. “To be tasked with” something is a phrasal verb mea ning to be given the job to do something or, more generally, to be responsible for something, for doing something. You could say, “I’m tasked with getting milk at the store,” meaning someone told you (probably your wife) to get some m ore milk at the store – or cheese, or butter, or meat, or chicken, or whatever .

The verb “to spot” (spot) means to identify somethi ng, especially something that might be difficult to see or to find. A “trend” (tr end) is something that has become popular recently. We often talk about “trends” on t he Internet – things that people are doing now. This is especially popular with youn g people. Trends in fashion, trends in music – what’s popular now or what has be en popular recently. Those are all trends.

Heidi says, “And you do that,” meaning you spot new  trends, “by reading magazines with your feet up?” “With your feet up” m eans just what it says. You are putting your feet up on a chair or on your desk  as a way of relaxing. Some people like to put their feet up when they relax. I n general, the expression “to put your feet up” means to relax, be calm, not work too  hard. Heidi is saying that Tim doesn’t look like he’s working very hard.

Tim says, however, “Why not?” meaning “Why not put my feet up?” “I also frequent places where hipsters hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, eating, drinking, a nd doing.” Tim then gives us some other things he does to spot new trends. He fr equents places. “To frequent” (frequent) as a verb means to go somewher e often or regularly, especially as a customer. “I frequent my local Star bucks.” That means I go there often as a customer.

Tim says he frequents “places where hipsters hang o ut.” A “hipster” (hipster) is usually a young person who follows all the latest t rends, all the latest fashions, especially when we’re talking about clothing or foo d or even ideas. Here in Los

Angeles, we have lots of young hipsters – people wh o listen to the most popular music or eat at the most popular restaurants and th ink in general that they’re pretty cool. That’s a hipster.

Tim is going to “places where hipsters hang out.” “ To hang (hang) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to spend time with others , or at a certain place having fun, but not really doing anything serious –  certainly not working. Tim, then, frequents places where hipsters hang out and observes what they’re doing, what they’re wearing, what they’re drinking, and so  forth. Heidi says, “That doesn’t sound too onerous” (onerous). “Onerous” is an adjective meaning difficult or challenging.

Tim says, “It’s all about finding the trendsetters,  the people who are beta testers and early adopters.” A “trendsetter” is a person wh o starts trends or who has a lot of influence on other people around him. If you are  a “trendsetter,” you are one of the first people to wear a certain kind of clothing  or eat a certain kind of food – that would be a trendsetter, someone who’s influent ial. We also might call this person an “influencer,” although that has a broader  meaning.

Tim also uses the word “beta (beta) tester (tester) .” Technically, a beta tester is someone who tries new types of software before the software is ready for everyone else to try. That’s a beta tester. Sometim es when a company starts a new product – “launches,” we would say, a new kind of software – it will ask people to be beta testers, to test it and find any problems in the software. Here I think Tim is using this term more generally to mean  people who are the first to try some new things, some new trend.

A “early adopter” (adopter) is a person who buys a new product right after it is available for purchase. An early adopter is a perso n who goes out and buys the newest iPhone or the newest computer as soon as it is made available for purchase, as soon as you can go and buy it. The ear ly adopter “adopts,” or starts using, that new technology right away. You can see there is a relationship here between “trendsetter,” “beta tester,” and “early ad opter.” All three terms relate to someone who does something before the general publi c does it.

Tim says, “These,” meaning, these people, “are also  the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course.” A “bellwether” (bellweth er) is a person or group or thing that indicates how something is changing or that pr edicts the future in some way. We might consider the word “bellwether” very simila r to the word “predictor” – an indication of how things will turn out in the futur e. For example, college campuses and universities are often bellwethers of larger so cial change. The change starts at the university and then becomes more popular in other parts of society.

 A “bellwether,” then, would be a person in this cas e who will indicate that there is some major or larger change that will take place in  the future. If you’re a trendsetter – if you’re a person who is influential  – when you change, that means that the rest of the world will change sometime in the future. So, looking at you can help us predict how things will change with oth er people in the future. The expression “to run its course” (course) means to en d – to no longer be popular, in this case. When a trend has run its course, it is no longer popular. It is no longer something that people are doing.

Heidi says, “Can’t you just see what people are buy ing?” She’s wondering why Tim has to do all this research. Tim says, “By then ,” meaning by the time people buy things, “it’s too late.” “Those are people who are jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers.” Tim is saying that it’ s too late to wait and see what becomes popular in terms of the general public, the  average person. You have to be able to see what will be popular in the near fut ure.

He describes people who are not trendsetters as peo ple who are “jumping on the bandwagon” (bandwagon). “To jump on the bandwagon” means to join something or to support something that is already p opular. You’re not one of the first people to join it or to do it – you wait unti l everybody else starts doing it and then you start doing it. That’s “jumping on the ban dwagon.” A “mover and shaker” is a person who is influential and powerful, especi ally someone in the business world. If you say someone is a mover and a shaker, you’re saying this person has a lot of power, has a lot of influence, in some  particular area.

Heidi says, “Well, don’t look at me,” meaning don’t  observe me for these trends. “I lag behind every trend.” “To lag (lag) behind” m eans to move more slowly than other people, to progress more slowly than everyone  else. If someone is “lagging behind,” they are behind or less advanced than ever yone around them. What Heidi is saying is that she doesn’t follow the late st trends. She lags behind. She will do something only after everyone else has alre ady done it.

She says she has no idea “what’s in or out.” “In” w ould be something that is popular or cool. “Out” would be something that is n ot popular or not cool. Tim says, “Luckily, you have me to tell you,” meaning f ortunately for you, I am doing that work, so I can tell you what’s in and out – wh at’s popular and not. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about your choice of footwea r.” “I’ve been meaning to talk to you” here means this is something that I have be en wanting to tell you.

Tim wants to say something to Heidi about her footw ear. “Footwear” (footwear) is what you wear on your feet. It refers to the kinds of shoes that you wear. We get

the idea that Tim is about to tell Heidi that her s hoes are no longer fashionable, or the style of her shoes is no longer “in,” but ra ther, “out.” That would probably describe everything that I wear. I’m definitely not  a trendsetter. In fact, I just discovered this new rock band that you might have h eard of already called the Beatles. Yeah. They’re really good.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Heidi: You look very relaxed reading magazines in t he middle of the workday.

Tim: It’s my job. I’m tasked with spotting new tren ds.

Heidi: And you do that by reading magazines with yo ur feet up?

Tim: Why not? I also frequent places where hipsters  hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, e ating, drinking, and doing.

Heidi: That doesn’t sound too onerous.

Tim: It’s all about finding the trendsetters, the p eople who are beta testers and early adopters. These are also the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course.

Heidi: Can’t you just see what people are buying?

Tim: By then, it’s too late. Those are people who a re jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers.

Heidi: Well, don’t look at me. I lag behind every t rend and don’t have any idea what’s in or out.

Tim: Luckily, you have me to tell you. I’ve been me aning to talk to you about your choice of footwear . . .

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,065 – Making Soups and Stews.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,065. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we have a dialogue between Charlot te and Mohamed about making a certain kind of food: soup, and a thick ki nd of soup called a stew. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Charlotte: Mmm, something smells good.

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!

Charlotte: Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.

Mohamed: I’m making chicken soup.

Charlotte: I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew . There’s nothing more appetizing on a cold day than a good stew.

Mohamed: Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup  with a clear stock and vegetables.

Charlotte: All you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.

Mohamed: I get it. You’re partial to thick soups, b ut I feel like making a simple chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a  slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée o r bisque would be nice too. Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could rea lly go for a nice bowl of chowder.

Mohamed: Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorr ow.

Charlotte: Really?

Mohamed: Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a can.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Charlotte saying to Moha med, “Mmm, something smells good.” “Mmm” is a sound that we make sometim es in English for something that looks good or, usually, smells and o r tastes good. When you see someone preparing food or you smell good food, you might go “Mmm, that smells delicious” – that smells like something I would rea lly want to eat. You would never do that, for example, in my kitchen when I’m cooking.

Mohamed isn’t very happy with Charlotte. Charlotte seems to be in Mohamed’s kitchen, because we hear him respond to Charlotte b y saying, “Hey, put down that lid!” A “lid” (lid) is the top of a pot or pan  that you use for cooking. “To put something down” means to put it back down where it was. So we can guess that Charlotte has taken the top or the lid off of the p an where Mohamed is looking something in order to smell it or to taste it. Char lotte says, “Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.” Charlotte wanted to see wh at Mohamed was cooking.

Mohamed says, “I’m making chicken soup.” “Soup” (so up), as you probably know, is a food that has some sort of sauce or liqu id as the base or as the main ingredient – the main part of the food. Usually you  put things into soup like noodles or, in this case, chicken. Soup is almost a lways eaten with a spoon, at least in the United States. There are some soups th at you might drink and eat without a spoon. You might just lift the bowl up an d drink it, but usually you eat soup with a spoon.

Charlotte says, “I’m really in the mood for a heart y stew.” A “stew” (stew) is a special kind of soup that’s very thick. It has typi cally a lot of meat and/or vegetables in it. Usually it takes a long time to p repare a stew. The adjective “hearty” (hearty), when used with food, describes s omething that is very thick, filling, and satisfying. Something that is hearty i s usually something that, after you eat it, you won’t feel hungry again for a long time .

 Charlotte says, “There’s nothing more appetizing on  a cold day than a good stew.” When we describe food as “appetizing” (appet izing), we mean it’s appealing. It makes you want to eat it. Mohamed say s, “Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup with a clear stock and vegetabl es.” Mohamed is saying that he’s not making a stew. He instead is making “a sim ple chicken soup with a clear stock.”

“Stock” (stock) has a couple of different meanings in English. Here, when we’re talking about food, it means a clear liquid that is  made usually by boiling meat, vegetables, and perhaps a few other ingredients. Yo u could have a chicken stock, which would be liquid that comes from puttin g a big chicken (or a little chicken) into a pot of boiling water. You get rid of the chicken, and what you have left is this liquid that has a chicken taste. We wo uld call that “chicken stock.”

You can do the same thing with other kinds of meat,  with fish or with vegetables, or some combination of those things. The idea of a stock is that it doesn’t have anything hard or solid in it; it’s just the liquid.  Mohamed is using a “clear (clear) stock.” A clear stock would be a stock that doesn’t  have a lot of color. “Chicken stock” is usually a clear stock. Charlotte says, “A ll you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer.  Then, presto! You have a stew.”

Charlotte is suggesting to Mohamed how he could cha nge his soup, his clear stock soup, into a stew. She says, “All you would h ave to do is thicken the soup.” “To thicken” (thicken) food means, not surprisingly , to make something thicker, especially by adding either flour or another ingred ient called cornstarch. You can thicken soups in a number of different ways. You ca n even use egg yolk – the inside of an egg, a raw egg, uncooked egg – to chic ken soup, or at least that’s what I read in a cookbook once.

“To simmer” (simmer) means to boil something at a v ery low heat. The water or the liquid in the pan is boiling, but it isn’t boil ing very rapidly. We would say it’s not a “full boil.” It is bubbling. You can see the bubbles on the top of the surface, but it’s all being done at a very low heat. Charlot te explains that stews are typically prepared, or made, by simmering the liqui d for a long time.

She says, “Then, presto! You have a stew.” “Presto”  (presto) is a word we use to indicate that something has happened very quickly, even magically. “Presto” comes from the Italian, meaning quick or fast or ra pid. We sometimes use that term in music, when talking about music that goes q uickly or rapidly – but more generally, the word is used to describe something t hat happens very quickly, and that’s what Charlotte is using the word here to mea n.

 Mohamed says, “I get it,” meaning yes, I understand . “You’re partial,” he says, “to thick soups.” “To be partial (partial) to” somethin g means to prefer something. Some men are partial to blondes – they like women w ho have blonde hair. Some people are partial to brunettes – women who have da rk or brown hair. Some people are partial to beer; if they want to drink s omething with alcohol in it, they drink beer. Some people are partial to wine – they have a preference for wine, and so forth. Charlotte is partial to stews, to thi ck soups.

Mohamed says, however, “I feel like making a simple  chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.” A “slow cooker” is a special kind of cooking machin e, an electric machine that cooks food very slowly for many hours at a time. A more common term for a slow cooker is a “crock (crock) pot.”

Many people have crock pots that they use to cook f ood for a very long period of time. Some people put food into the crock pot in the morning before they go to work, and when they come home later in the day, the  food is done. It’s been cooking slowly the whole day. That particular kind of cooking machine is called a “slow cooker” or a “crock pot.”

Mohamed usually makes stews in a crock pot, he says , not in a pot. A “pot” (pot) here refers to a metal container, something you coo k with that is put on top of some source of heat, usually a stove, and is used t o cook things like soup. “Pot” has a number of different meanings in English. “Pot ” can also refer to marijuana, that you smoke. You have to be very careful which k ind of pot you use in the kitchen. Do you want to prepare some food, or do yo u want something else to happen?

Charlotte says, “All right, all right.” She is sayi ng that yes, she understands that Mohamed doesn’t want to make her stew. She then say s, “Oh, a nice purée or bisque would be nice too.” A “purée” (purée) is a s mooth and creamy soup or other kind of food that is made by putting food usu ally into a special machine called a “blender” (blender). You might make a vege table purée, when you take vegetables and you chop them up into very small pie ces by putting them in this special kind of machine that chops up and blends fo od, called a “blender.”

Charlotte says, “Oh, I would also like soup that is  a purée or a bisque” (bisque). A “bisque” is a creamy, thick soup. We often make lob ster bisque, which is a thick soup made with the meat of a lobster. Charlotte say s, “Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now?” A “chowder” (chowder) is another k ind of thick soup, a stew that

is usually made with seafood, potatoes, milk, and/o r cream. A very common kind of chowder in the U.S. is “clam (clam) chowder.” A “clam” is a kind of shellfish.

Charlotte says, “I could really go for a nice bowl of chowder.” “To go for” something means to really want to do something or t o have something. When we’re talking about food, it’s something that you w ould really want to eat. “I could go for a nice big doughnut” – I feel like eating a nice big doughnut. I always feel like eating a nice big doughnut, but if I ate dough nuts every time I felt like eating doughnuts, I would be 500 pounds and not very healt hy.

Anyway, Mohamed says, “Fine, we’ll have chowder for  dinner tomorrow.” He’s telling Charlotte that he will make a thick soup, a  chowder, for her – not today, but tomorrow. Charlotte says, “Really?” Mohamed say s, “Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a ca n. Mohamed is saying yes, we’ll have chowder tomorrow, but I’m not going to make the chowder – I’m going to just buy a can of soup prepared already from the  store and give you that.

Of course, soup from a can never as good – almost n ever – as soup from your own kitchen, soup that you prepare. Mohamed is not saying that he’s going to cook Charlotte some chowder. He instead is saying h e’s just going to buy a can of chowder and give her that – which is not very ni ce, Mohamed, really. But then again, if Charlotte really wants chowder, she can l earn how to cook herself and make her own soup.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Charlotte: Mmm, something smells good.

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!

Charlotte: Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.

Mohamed: I’m making chicken soup.

Charlotte: I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew . There’s nothing more appetizing on a cold day than a good stew.

Mohamed: Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup  with a clear stock and vegetables.

 Charlotte: All you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.

Mohamed: I get it. You’re partial to thick soups, b ut I feel like making a simple chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a  slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée o r bisque would be nice too. Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could rea lly go for a nice bowl of chowder.

Mohamed: Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorr ow.

# Buying a Luxury Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,066 – Buying a Luxury Car.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,066. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode of the ESL Podcast is about buying a “ luxury” – or very expensive and nice – automobile. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Narin: This car is amazing.

Daniel: I know. It has every luxury option availabl e.

Narin: This sumptuous interior is so comfortable.

Daniel: You haven’t seen anything yet. It has a cli mate control system for every seat and a voice-activated entertainment system. It  also has the best navigation system money can buy. Let me turn this car on with the remote starter.

Narin: That’s impressive. How does it drive?

Daniel: It drives like a dream. It has the most res ponsive handling of any car I’ve driven, and it has such a smooth ride you’d hardly know we’re moving.

Narin: You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.

Daniel: And this car is safe, too. It has seven air  bags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rear co llisions.

Narin: Can you give me a ride home?

Daniel: No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gone.

Narin: Couldn’t you just tell him you were taking a  potential customer out on a test drive?

Daniel: Again?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Narin saying to Daniel, “T his car is amazing” – this car is wonderful. Daniel says, “I know. It has every lu xury option available.” An “option” is one possibility among many. The word “l uxury” here is used to mean very nice and very expensive.

Narin says, “This sumptuous interior is so comforta ble.” She’s saying that the inside of the car – the “interior” of the car, wher e the seats are – is “so comfortable,” is very comfortable. The word “sumptu ous” (sumptuous) is similar to the word “luxurious.” They both mean expensive l ooking, very nice – very, in this case, comfortable.

Daniel says, “You haven’t seen anything yet.” This expression, “You haven’t seen anything yet,” means there is even something better  about this particular item or thing. Daniel says, “It” – meaning the car – “has a  climate control system for every seat.” The word “climate” (climate) usually d escribes the weather, the atmosphere, the way things are outside. Is it rainy ? Is it snowy? That is related to climate – how the general weather patterns are in a  given area. Here in Southern California, we have a desert climate in part of the  area, where it’s very dry and warm.

Well, here we’re talking about climate in a little different way. We’re talking more about the atmosphere or environment of a certain pl ace. “Climate control systems” in a car are ways of controlling the tempe rature of, in this case, the seats in the car. So, you could actually have one s eat that was hotter than another. Weird, I know, but that’s what some cars a llow you to do if they have a climate control system.

Another thing that Daniel points out about this car  is that it has a “voice-activated entertainment system.” The word “activated” comes f rom the verb “to activate” (activate). “To activate” means to start something or to get something functioning or working. If something is “voice-activated,” it t urns on and off and does what you want it to do just by talking to it, just by sp eaking to it.

 A lot of modern cell phones, especially what are ca lled “smart phones,” have voice-activated features. You can say something and  the phone will do something. There are other kinds of technology that  use voice activation. Daniel is talking about an “entertainment system” in a car , probably things like the CD or MP3 player.

Daniel says, “The car also has the best navigation system money can buy.” A “navigation system” is a part of the car that usual ly gives you a map and directions about how to get from where you are now to where you want to go. More commonly, at least in the United States, this is called a “GPS” system, for “global positioning system.” In other countries, th ey might use different terms. In Great Britain, sometimes they use the term “Sat Nav ” for “Satellite Navigation.” The word “navigation” in general is used to mean ho w you get from one place to another.

Daniel concludes by saying, “Let me turn this car o n with the remote starter.” A “starter” (starter) in this case is something that starts the engine, that gets the motor or the engine running, or working. The word “ remote” (remote) in general means something that is from a distance to another thing. If you have a television, you probably have what we would call a “remote control,” or simply a “remote.” It’s a way of controlling the television without having to get up, walk across the room, and change the channel or the volu me.

You know, kids, that’s how we used to do it back wh en I was younger. You actually had to get out of your chair in order to t urn the channel on the television. Crazy, right? I know. Well, now some cars, instead of using a key that you put into a part of the car to start the engine, have re mote starters – things that you can use to start your car even if you’re not in the  car. Why would you want to start your car if you’re not in it? I have no idea,  but you can do it, and that’s the important thing.

Narin says, “That’s impressive.” Something that is “impressive” is something that you think is great, is amazing. She then asks Danie l, “How does it drive?” meaning is it a comfortable drive when you ride in the car? Do you feel comfortable? Does it move fast when you want it to go fast? And so forth. Daniel says, “It drives like a dream.” A “dream” is normal ly something you have when you’re sleeping. It’s something that is part of you r imagination, but here it’s used to mean it’s wonderful. It’s excellent.

He says that the car “has the most responsive handl ing of any car I’ve driven.” The word “responsive” (responsive) is related to the verb “to respond” (respond).

“To respond” means to react when someone else says something or does something. If someone asks you a question, you answ er the question by responding. The person says something to you; you s ay something back to the person. “Responsive,” then, has to do with how well  something reacts.

The word “handling” (handling) refers, in general, to how easy it is to control the car. You know, sometimes you have cars where, when you turn the steering wheel (the round wheel that you turn inside the car  in order to make it go to the left or to the right) the car turns right away. You  have other cars where you have to turn the wheel a lot in order to get the car to turn one direction or the other.

I used to own, many years ago, an old station wagon . It was a big, long car and it was sort of like riding in a boat or a ship. You’d turn the wheel and it would take a long time for the car to move left or right. Well, that’s what we’re talking about when we refer to “responsive handling” of a car. Da niel says, “The car has a smooth ride.” A “ride” (ride) here refers simply to  how comfortable the car is. “Smooth” (smooth) is an adjective meaning that it’s  very comfortable. There aren’t a lot of up and downs, a lot of bumps that y ou feel when you are riding in the car.

Narin (who’s I guess now in the car, riding in it) says, “You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.” A “cloud” is that white material that you see up in the sky from which we get rain and snow and other forms of water. Nari n compares driving in the car, or riding in the car, to riding on a cloud, wh ere you seem to go by very smoothly like a cloud might in the sky.

Daniel says, “And this car is safe, too. It has sev en airbags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rea r collisions.” “Airbags” are these bags that blow up, or inflate, if your car is in an  accident. The airbags prevent you from hurting yourself – at least, that’s what they’ re supposed to do. An “alert system for blind spots” refers to usually a compute r in the car that will tell you if there is someone in your blind spot. Your “blind (b lind) spot” is the area next to your car that is difficult to see in the mirrors of  the car.

That’s why whenever you, for example, change from o ne lane to another, from one part of the street or highway to another, you s hould always look behind you and to your side to make sure there isn’t another c ar there. Sometimes you don’t see the car there in your mirrors. So some cars, I guess, have these alert systems for blind spots. I have in my car, usually,  an alert system. I call it “my wife.” She will yell and scream if I’m about to hit  another car. It works very well and it’s a lot cheaper than most of these new cars.  Well, a little cheaper.

Anyway, Daniel is talking about an alert system for  blind spots, and he says that this alert system helps avoid front and rear collis ions. A “collision” (collision) is when one car hits another. It’s an accident, or a “ crash,” we might call it. Narin says, “Can you give me a ride home?” Daniel says, “ No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gon e.” So now we understand the story. Daniel doesn’t own this car; he works at a p lace that sells cars. We would call it a “car lot” (lot), and he’s borrowed this c ar and is probably trying to impress this girl by the name Narin.

Narin says, “Couldn’t you just tell him,” meaning t he boss, “you were taking a potential customer out on a test drive?” A “test dr ive” is when you go to a car lot to buy a car and drive in the car before you buy it . You want to see if you like the car or not, so you take it on a test drive. Narin i s suggesting, then, that Daniel just tell his boss that he was out with the car with a p otential customer. A “customer” is someone who buys something. A “potential custome r” is someone who might buy something.

Daniel responds to Narin’s suggestion by saying, “A gain?” The idea is that he has already used this excuse before when he has, we  are guessing, taken cars out of the car lot to drive.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Narin: This car is amazing.

Daniel: I know. It has every luxury option availabl e.

Narin: This sumptuous interior is so comfortable.

Daniel: You haven’t seen anything yet. It has a cli mate control system for every seat and a voice-activated entertainment system. It  also has the best navigation system money can buy. Let me turn this car on with the remote starter.

Narin: That’s impressive. How does it drive?

Daniel: It drives like a dream. It has the most res ponsive handling of any car I’ve driven, and it has such a smooth ride you’d hardly know we’re moving.

Narin: You’re right. It’s like riding on a cloud.

 Daniel: And this car is safe, too. It has seven air  bags and an alert system for blind spots, which helps to avoid front and rear co llisions.

Narin: Can you give me a ride home?

Daniel: No, I have to get this car back to the car lot before my boss notices it’s gone.

Narin: Couldn’t you just tell him you were taking a  potential customer out on a test drive?

Daniel: Again?

This episode is a dialogue between Sadie and Gordon  about going to everyone’s favorite destination, everyone’s favorite place: the dentist’s office. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sadie: Hi, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.

Gordon: Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet you. It’s a li ttle strange to be set up, isn’t it?

Sadie: It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arrange t his date.

Gordon: It was. Jaime told me that you’re a dentist . Is that right?

Sadie: Yes.

Gordon: That must be interesting work.

Sadie: Well, I think so. Just today, I did a root c anal and removed a set of wisdom teeth. Oh, but you wouldn’t want to hear abo ut that.

Gordon: Sure, I do. I want to get to know you bette r.

Sadie: In that case, since I live in a small town, I do basic dental work, but also act as a periodontist, oral surgeon, and orthodonti st when the need arises.

Gordon: Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge to ke ep up on.

Sadie: I don’t mind. One day, it’s cavities and cro wns, and the next, extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays. I had a  very interesting case the other day…

Gordon: Go on.

Sadie: It’s a little unpleasant, maybe not good din ner conversation.

Gordon: Maybe you’re right. It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinner.

Sadie: Felina didn’t mention what you did for a liv ing.

Gordon: I’m a proctologist.

Sadie: Ah, I see your point.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Sadie saying to Gordon, “H i, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.” Gordon says, “Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet  you. It’s a little strange to be set up, isn’t it?” “To be set (set) up” is to have someone arrange for you to meet another person in whom you might be romantically in terested. “To set two people up” is to arrange a situation where both of them ca n be together and go out, usually on a date. That seems to be what’s happenin g for Sadie and Gordon.

Sadie says, “It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arr ange this date.” “To arrange” here means to plan and make happen this date. A “da te” (date) here means a romantic appointment – a meeting of two people who are romantically interested in each other, or who might be. Gordon agrees with Sadie that it was nice of their friends to set up this date for the two of them. “J aime told me that you’re a dentist,” Gordon says. “Is that right?” A “dentist”  (dentist) is a doctor who works on your teeth in your mouth, of course. Sadie says, “Yes,” meaning yes, I am a dentist.

Gordon says, “That must be interesting work.” Sadie  says, “Well, I think so. Just today I did a root canal and removed a set of wisdo m teeth.” A “root (root) canal (canal)” is a special kind of dental procedure wher e the dentist goes in and removes part of the root of a tooth and puts in usu ally some other sort of substance to protect it. A root canal can be very p ainful – or at least, if you need a root canal, the pain leading up to the root canal  can be quite severe. Sometimes people say jokingly about an experience t hat was very painful, “It was like having a root canal.”

 A “set of wisdom teeth” refers to teeth that are us ually in the very back of your mouth. They are called “molars” (molars). I say the y are usually in the back of your mouth. They’re always in the back of your mout h – I’m sure. These teeth often begin to grow and “come in,” we would say, af ter your other teeth have already developed, and sometimes it’s necessary to remove the wisdom teeth in order to have enough room in your mouth, unless you ’re like me and you have a really big mouth. But for a lot of people, the dent ist will remove wisdom teeth.

Anyway, Sadie and Gordon are on this date and Sadie  starts talking about her work as a dentist, and then she says, “Oh, but you don’t want to hear about that.” Gordon says, “Sure, I do. I want to get to know you  better.” Aww, isn’t that nice? Gordon knows how to say the right thing, right guys ? Anyway, Sadie says, “In that case,” meaning well if that’s true, “since I l ive in a small town, I do basic dental work but also act as a periodontist, oral su rgeon, and orthodontist when the need arises.”

Sadie says she lives in a small town, and if it is a small town, there may not be many dentists there – and that seems to be the case , because in addition to doing regular dental work, Sadie says she also acts  “as a periodontist.” “To act (act) as” something or someone is to do a certain s ervice or perform a certain service or, we might say, “fill a particular role.”  If you act as someone’s advisor, you are giving them advice and suggestions. Well, S adie says she sometimes acts as a “periodontist.”

What, you ask, is a “periodontist” (periodontist)? A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in improving the health of the bones an d the structures that hold the teeth in place. So, your teeth, of course, obviousl y go into the part of your body called the “jaw,” which is on the bottom of your fa ce. A periodontist would be a dentist who is very knowledgeable and specializes i n taking care of the place where the teeth go into your mouth – your “gums” (g ums) – and other parts of the structure of the jaw.

An “oral surgeon,” which is also one of the things that Sadie says she does, is a person who specializes in cutting open the mouth an d the jaws in surgery. A “surgeon” (surgeon) is a general term for a doctor that takes a knife and usually cuts a hole in you in order to make you better – at  least, we hope they make you better. Because Sadie lives in a small town, not on ly does she sometimes do work related to the work of a periodontist and an o ral surgeon, but she also acts as an “orthodontist.”

An “orthodontist” (orthodontist) is a dentist who make sure that your teeth are straight,  that they stand in a straight line – usu ally so that your teeth look better, although sometimes people need to have their teeth straightened because they’re so crooked it causes other problems. It’s n ot unusual for parents to take their teenagers to an orthodontist if their teeth a re somehow not quite straight, and that just happens naturally. It’s not that the teenager has done anything wrong.

Gordon says, “Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge  to keep up on.” The phrasal verb “to keep up on” something means to be informed  about, to have the latest news about. We of course want our doctors and denti sts to keep up on the latest research – the latest and most current information about what they do – so they give us the best possible treatments. Sadie says, “ I don’t mind,” meaning I am not bothered by the fact that I have to keep up on all these different areas of dentistry.

She says, “One day its cavities and crowns, and the  next extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays.” There’s a lot of s pecialized vocabulary in that sentence. Let’s go back and very briefly explain wh at it all means. Let’s start with “cavities” (cavities). Cavities are small holes in your teeth that sometimes the dentist has to fill in order to make sure there are n’t further problems in the future with your teeth.

A “crown” (crown) is normally something that a king  or queen wears on top of his or her head. However, you could also put a crown on  your tooth, which is basically something that covers your tooth. Many cr owns are permanent, meaning once it’s on, it stays on. “Extractions” (e xtractions) refer to when a dentist has to remove some of your teeth from your mouth. The verb is “to extract,” which means to take something out of. Usu ally it’s a difficult process, but not always.

“Bridgework” is when a dentist creates artificial o r, basically, false teeth that are then attached to your regular teeth. “Bridgework” r efers to putting in the false teeth, the artificial teeth. “Dentures” (dentures) refer to the actual false teeth. “Bridgework” refers to the work the dentist does to  attach the false teeth. The “dentures” are the actual false teeth themselves, a nd usually dentures are teeth that you put into and take out of your mouth.

An “implant” (implant) refers to something that goe s inside of your body, in this case we’re talking about a tooth.  Although women –  some women, especially here in Los Angeles – have other kinds of things th ey put in the upper part of their body which are called “implants.” But we’re n ot here to talk about that.

Finally, “inlay” (inlay) is a substance that is put  on the surface or the outer part of the tooth in order to fill a hole. That’s one way t hat a dentist might prevent further damage to your teeth if you have a holes in them.

Gordon is interested in what Sadie has to say. Sadi e says, however, that all of this talk of dental work is a little unpleasant – “ maybe not good dinner conversation,” she says. Gordon says, “Maybe you’re  right,” – maybe that’s true. “It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinn er.” “To talk shop” (shop) has nothing to do with going out and buying things in a  store. Instead, it refers to talking about your work when you’re not at work – w hen you are at home or with friends or family. “To talk shop” is to talk about work outside of the normal times when you are working.

That’s what Gordon is saying here – that it’s proba bly not a good idea for them, on this romantic date, to talk about their work. Sa die says, “Felina didn’t mention what you did for a living.” In other words, Sadie wants to know what Gordon does, what his job is. Gordon says, “I’m a proctolo gist.” A “proctologist” (proctologist) is a doctor who specializes in probl ems of the rectum and “anus” (anus).

Now, this is one I’m going to let you look up on yo ur own on the Internet, because I know that Dr. Tse put this word in the sc ript so that I would have to explain it, but this is one of those rare cases whe re I would like you to go onto your computer and put in “proctologist” (proctologi st) and “anus” (anus) and you will get that definition all by yourself. I know yo u can do it, so just go ahead and do it, and then I’ve done my job and you’ve done yo urs.

But if you really don’t want to do that, a proctolo gist has to do with things related to your butt – to that part of the body that you si t on. See? Now you know why I don’t want to talk about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sadie: Hi, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.

Gordon: Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet you. It’s a li ttle strange to be set up, isn’t it?

Sadie: It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arrange t his date.

Gordon: It was. Jaime told me that you’re a dentist . Is that right?

 Sadie: Yes.

Gordon: That must be interesting work.

Sadie: Well, I think so. Just today, I did a root c anal and removed a set of wisdom teeth. Oh, but you wouldn’t want to hear abo ut that.

Gordon: Sure, I do. I want to get to know you bette r.

Sadie: In that case, since I live in a small town, I do basic dental work, but also act as a periodontist, oral surgeon, and orthodonti st when the need arises.

Gordon: Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge to ke ep up on.

Sadie: I don’t mind. One day, it’s cavities and cro wns, and the next, extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays. I had a  very interesting case the other day…

Gordon: Go on.

Sadie: It’s a little unpleasant, maybe not good din ner conversation.

Gordon: Maybe you’re right. It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinner.

Sadie: Felina didn’t mention what you did for a liv ing.

Gordon: I’m a proctologist.

Sadie: Ah, I see your point.

[end of dialogue]

Listening to today’s script was nothing like having  a root canal. It was just the opposite – at least, I hope it was.



# An Expiring Business Lease

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,068 – An Expiring Business Lease.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,068. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store that has some additional courses in Business and Daily Engli sh I know you’re going to love.

This episode is a dialogue about a business that ha s to renew or sign a new contract or lease for a place that they rent. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jane: Our lease is up at the end of this year and w e need to negotiate a new one.

Monty: I know, but if I bring it up first, the land lord will think I’m desperate to renew.

Jane: We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our bu siness here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestablish it el sewhere.

Monty: I know, but given our antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up our rent and we’ll be forced out.

Jane: It’s in the best interest of the landlord to keep a steady business leasing his property.

Monty: He might not see it that way. He might see t his as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant.

Jane: Or he may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

Monty: Or he might think, “Out with the old and in with the new.”

Jane: You won’t know until you contact him.

Monty: Right, but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.

[end of dialogue]

Jane begins our dialogue by saying to Monty, “Our l ease is up at the end of this year.” Your “lease” (lease) is your contract that d eals with something that you are renting. You could lease a car, for example. You co uld lease a house. You could lease an apartment. You could lease an office. All of these are things that you can sign a contract about and use if you pay the pe rson who owns those things some money.

So, when you lease an apartment, you are renting an  apartment. When you lease a car, you are basically renting the car, but  we don’t use the verb “rent” (rent) for cars. We usually use the word “lease.” F or a business, you can use either rent or lease. These are verbs that indicate  that you are paying money to use something. “Lease” is also a noun referring to the contract itself, the legal agreement that you and the owner sign regarding the  property or the thing that you are renting.

Jane says that their “lease is up.” When we say som ething is “up,” we mean it’s expired, it’s ended – it’s at the end of some perio d of time. In fact, in school sometimes teachers will say, “Time’s up” or “Your t ime is up” when they are giving an examination, a test, to their students. T eachers will tell their students, “Time’s up,” meaning you can no longer work on the test or the exam.

Well here, we’re talking about a lease that is up, meaning it is about to “expire” (expire). “To expire” means to end, in this case. “ To expire” can also mean to die, informally. People say, “He expired.” The nicer way  of saying that someone died is that he “passed away.” Here, we’re not talking a bout a person, but a lease that has expired.

Jane says, “We need to negotiate a new one,” meanin g a new lease. “To negotiate” means to try to reach an agreement with someone, usually over something involving money or something of value. Yo u could negotiate an agreement between two countries, for example. An ag reement between two countries is usually called a “treaty” (treaty). He re, we’re talking about negotiating a lease.

Monty says, “I know, but if I bring it up first, the landlord will think I’m desperate to renew.” Monty is worried about bringing something u p. “To bring something up” here means to mention something that the other pers on hasn’t talked about yet – to raise an issue or to introduce a new topic that the other person hasn’t been

talking about or hasn’t referred to yet. Sometimes people will say, “I hate to bring this up,” meaning I hate to mention this because it ’s perhaps something unpleasant.

But to bring something up doesn’t mean that it’s un pleasant, that it’s something that’s going to cause a problem. You can bring up a nything as a topic of conversation, whether it’s positive or negative. Mo nty, however, is worried about bringing up the topic of the lease renewal because he thinks the landlord will think he’s “desperate to renew.” A “landlord” (land lord) is a person who owns a building, office, home, condominium, or apartment a nd who rents that property out to another person – who leases the property to another person.

The landlord will think that Monty is “desperate to  renew” if Monty brings up the topic first. “To be desperate” (desperate) is to be  in a difficult situation, a difficult problem with very few options, with very few choice s. Someone who is desperate is someone who is in a lot of trouble and doesn’t k now what to do or doesn’t have many options in terms of getting out of the trouble  that he’s in. Monty doesn’t want to seem “desperate to renew” his lease. “To re new” means to sign a new lease, to extend the period of time of the rental o r of the lease.

Jane says, “We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our business here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestabl ish it elsewhere. Jane is saying, well, we are desperate; we really do want to renew the lease. The word “desperate” is sometimes used, as it is here, to me an not exactly that you have no options, but that you really, really want a cert ain thing to happen.

Jane really wants them to renew their lease because  they have built a business at this particular location. They may have a store or a restaurant, and it made have been there for many years, so they don’t want to move it somewhere else. They want to stay there. They’ve built their busine ss there. She says it would be “difficult to uproot it.” “To uproot” (uproot) mean s to move from one place to another, especially from somewhere where you are co mfortable and want to stay.

Monty says, “I know” – I understand – “but given ou r antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up o ur rent and we’ll be forced out.” “Antagonistic (antagonistic) dealings (dealings)” a re interactions or conversations with another person that are negative or that invol ve some sort of strong disagreement. If you fight a lot with another perso n, you are “antagonistic” toward that person. You don’t like them.

“Dealings” has to do with conversations – or “inter actions,” we would also say – between one person and another. So, if you have “an tagonistic dealings” with, say, the landlord, you have had a lot of disagreeme nts and arguments in the past. We would use this expression, “antagonistic d ealings,” when we are talking about a work situation or a business situation like  this.

Monty is afraid the landlord is going to “jack up t he rent.” “To jack (jack) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to increase, but to i ncrease dramatically – to increase something a lot. If the landlord jacks up your rent, he or she increases it by a significant amount. You were paying $500 a mon th, and now you’re going to pay a thousand dollars a month. That would be jacki ng up your rent a lot, significantly. The “rent” here, as a noun, refers t o the money that you pay every month or every year to lease the property.

“To be forced out” is a phrasal verb meaning to hav e to leave somewhere even though you want to stay. If a landlord forces out a  person renting from him, he’s making that person leave even though the person doe sn’t want to leave. The person who rents from a landlord, by the way, is ca lled a “tenant” (tenant). You will come across that word in a second.

Jane says, “It’s in the best interest of the landlo rd to keep a steady business leasing his property.” If you say something is “in the best interest” of someone, you mean that it’s a good situation for that person . It benefits that person. In this case, it is in the best interest of the landlord – meaning it would be a good thing for the landlord – to keep a steady business leasin g his property. “Steady” (steady) means without changing. If you have a “ste ady customer,” you have a customer who always comes back to your store, every  week or every month.

A “steady tenant” would be someone who leases from a landlord for a long period of time. All landlords know that it’s better  to have someone paying you some money for your property than no money, and so landlords like to keep tenants as long as they can, so at least they are g etting money. Monty says, however, that the landlord “might not see it that w ay,” meaning the landlord may not necessarily have the same opinion of the situat ion. He says, “He might see this as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant,” someone who will give him even more money.

Jane disagrees. She says, “Or he” (again, the landl ord) “may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” This is an old expression: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” (bush). The word “bush” h ere doesn’t refer to one of our former U.S. presidents. It refers to a small shrub.  It’s like a plant, but it’s a plant that has a lot of branches and leaves on it, typica lly.

 The expression “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” means it’s better to keep something that you have and you know for sure will give you some benefit than to try to get something new with the possibili ty that you won’t get anything better if you give up what you already have. Let me  give you an example.

Let’s say that you are working at a job, and you are making $20 an hour. You have an opportunity to leave that job and get anoth er job that will pay you $30 an hour. However, you might not get the job. You have to quit your first job in order to apply for the second job. So, you would have to lose your job, your certain $20 an hour, for the possibility of getting a better jo b, but it might not work out. You might not get the job. And so if that happens, you would be without any money.

“A bird in the hand” – meaning if you’re holding a bird in your hand – that’s worth more than two birds that are sitting over there tha t you don’t have. Of course, to get the two birds, you have to let go of the bird i n your hand and run over and try to grab the other two birds with your hands. So, th at’s kind of the background of that rather complicated expression.

Monty comes back with another expression. He says, “Out with the old and in with the new.” This is another common saying or exp ression. It means to get rid of the old things in your life and bring in new thi ngs in your life because the new things will be better or more exciting. Jane says, “You won’t know until you contact him.” Jane is telling Monty that he won’t k now the real situation until he actually talks to the landlord.

Monty says, “Right” – meaning yes, I understand, yo u are correct – “but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.” The verb “to st ew” (stew) means to think and worry about something, especially without telling a nyone else that you are worried about it or that you are thinking about it.  It’s a negative thing.

If someone says, “I’ve been stewing all day over my  presentation,” he means he’s been thinking about this all day, but he hasn’ t talked to anyone else. He hasn’t gotten any help from anyone else. He’s just been there thinking and worrying about it. Usually if you stew about someth ing, the idea is that you’re worrying about it, but you’re not really helping yo urself. You’re wasting your time thinking about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Jane: Our lease is up at the end of this year and w e need to negotiate a new one.

Monty: I know, but if I bring it up first, the land lord will think I’m desperate to renew.

Jane: We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our bu siness here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestablish it el sewhere.

Monty: I know, but given our antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up our rent and we’ll be forced out.

Jane: It’s in the best interest of the landlord to keep a steady business leasing his property.

Monty: He might not see it that way. He might see t his as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant.

Jane: Or he may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

Monty: Or he might think, “Out with the old and in with the new.”

Jane: You won’t know until you contact him.

Monty: Right, but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.

This episode is a dialogue between Vince and Alana about what happens with a child, one of your children, who does something tha t makes you angry. We’ll find out what Vince’s solution is in a moment. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Vince: That’s it! I’ve had it with Daniel defying m e at every turn. I want him to follow in my footsteps and study law, but he wants to be an artist. He dates girls I don’t approve of. But this! This is beyond the boun ds of what I’ll tolerate.

Alana: I know you’re upset, but don’t do anything r ash. I’m sure Daniel didn’t mean what he said.

Vince: Oh, he meant it. That’s it! I’m disowning an d disinheriting him.

Alana: I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke  in anger. I’m sure a cooling- off period of a few days will change his mind.

Vince: It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out of my  will tomorrow. I have other descendants who’ll appreciate inheriting my money a nd property.

Alana: But Daniel is your rightful heir. He’s your only child.

Vince: Then he should have known how his hateful wo rds would hurt me.

Alana: What did he say exactly?

Vince: He said he has become a San Francisco Giants  fan. A Giants fan!

Alana: That’s it?

 Vince: That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core!

[end of dialogue]

Vince begins by saying to Alana, “That’s it!” When someone says, “That’s it!” they mean this is the final action that I’m going to put  up with or tolerate. We say it when we’re angry and frustrated. Vince is angry and  frustrated. He says, “I’ve had it with Daniel defying me at every turn.” When we say we’ve “had it” with someone or something, we mean that we are tired of it. We are frustrated by something. We no longer will tolerate it or put up with it.

Vince is tired of Daniel defying him at every turn.  “To defy” (defy) someone means to refuse to obey someone, to say no when som eone tells you to do something. That’s what Daniel is doing. He’s defyin g Vince at every turn. The expression “at every turn” means frequently, repeat edly – every time the possibility arises, every time the situation arises . Daniel is taking the opportunity of saying no to Vince.

Vince says, “I want him to follow in my footsteps a nd study law, but he wants to be an artist.” “To follow in someone’s footsteps” ( footsteps) means to do what another person has done, especially the same kind of job or profession that another person has. So, for example, if your father  was a teacher and you decide to become a teacher, we might say that you have fol lowed in your father’s footsteps.

My father was a teacher. I became a teacher. So I, in fact, followed in my father’s footsteps. Your “footsteps” literally are the place s where you put your foot down on the ground. If you walk in an area that has very  soft dirt or mud, you will leave “footprints,” just like your fingers leave fingerpr ints when you touch something. Footprints come from your footsteps – the places wh ere your foot touches the ground.

Vince wants Daniel to become a lawyer – to study la w – but Daniel wants to be an artist. Vince says that Daniel “dates girls I do n’t approve of.” “To date” a girl would be to go out on a date, a romantic meeting, w ith a girl (or boy). “I don’t approve of” is an expression we use to mean “I don’ t think is a good idea.” So, like I suppose a lot of sons, Daniel is going out o n dates, getting romantically involved, with women that Vince doesn’t approve of,  that his father doesn’t approve of.

This never really happened to me. In fact, when I w ould come home with a girlfriend, my parents would always ask me why the girl was going out with me. They would tell the girl, “Hey, you can find somebo dy better than this guy, right?” So, I had the opposite problem. Vince, getting back  to our story, has a problem with his son, Daniel. He says, “This is beyond the bounds of what I’ll tolerate.”

So, clearly Daniel has done something that Vince do esn’t like. He says it’s “beyond the bounds” (bounds) of what he’ll tolerate . If we say something is “beyond the bounds,” we mean it’s gone past what yo u think is acceptable. It has gone past the limits of something. Alana says, “I k now you’re upset, but don’t do anything rash.” “To do something rash” (rash) is to  do something in a hurry, quickly, but without thinking of what might happen,  the bad consequences of what might happen.

We use this word especially when someone makes a qu ick decision about something in anger or because he’s frustrated, with out really thinking about it carefully and clearly. Alana says, “I’m sure Daniel  didn’t mean what he said.” Daniel has said something to Vince that Vince doesn ’t like. Alana is saying that he probably didn’t mean it, meaning he said it, but  he didn’t really believe it.

Vince disagrees. He says, “Oh, he meant it. That’s it. I’m disowning and disinheriting him.” “To disown” (disown) someone is  to refuse to help or support one of your children, your son or your daughter. Yo u say, “I’m not going to have any relationship with that person. I’m not going to  help them. I’m not going to support them.” It is as if that person were no long er your child. That’s “to disown” someone. “To disinherit” (disinherit) means that yo u are not going to give anything to that person – any money or any property  – when you die.

Normally, when your parents die, the money or posse ssions that they have would legally become yours – at least, unless they wrote out a special document called a “will” (will) that specifies where their money an d property should go after their deaths. So for a parent to disinherit a child is, of course, a very serious thing. The parent is saying that the child will not get any of  their money or property when the parent dies. Alana tries to calm things down. She s ays, “I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke in anger.”

“To speak in anger” means to say something when you ’re mad, and often when we speak in anger, we say things that we don’t real ly mean. We say things to hurt another person or to get another person angry.  Alana says, “I’m sure a cooling-off period of a few days will change his,” meaning Daniel’s, “mind.” “To cool off” means to become calm and relaxed after yo u have been angry and upset. A “cooling-off period” would be time when tw o people agree basically not

to communicate with each other, talk to each other,  so both of them can calm down.

Vince says, “It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out  of my will tomorrow.” We already explained what a will is. It’s a legal document tha t specifies where or to whom your money goes when you die. “To cut someone out of your will” means to say this person was going to get some money, but now he ’s not. You’re eliminating that person from your will. You’re no longer giving  that person any money or property.

Vince says, “I have other descendants who will appr eciate inheriting my money and property.” Your “descendants” (descendants) are  people who are related to you, but usually younger than you. Your children, y our grandchildren, your great- grandchildren – those people would be your descenda nts. “To inherit” (inherit) means to get money from someone who has died. Vince  is saying that he has other people who are related to him who will apprec iate his money and property when he dies, so he’s saying that other people will  be thankful and grateful for getting his money, unlike Daniel.

Alana says, however, “Daniel is your rightful heir. ” Your “heir” (heir) is a person who receives your money or property when you die. U sually we talk about an heir when referring to children – the children that you have. Your “rightful (rightful) heir” is the person who should receive the money. I t is the person who – by custom, tradition, or law – gets your money and pro perty when you die.

So, in the United States, for example, if you die a nd you don’t leave a will – that is, you don’t make a legal agreement or write out a  legal document specifying where your money and property should go when you di e – your rightful heirs are your children if you have children, or your spouse,  your husband or wife, if you’re married. What if you’re not married and have no chi ldren?

Well, then the money goes to your closest relatives , perhaps a brother or a cousin or a nephew. If you’re writing out a will an d you don’t know whom you should give your money to, you should just put my n ame in there: Jeffrey McQuillan of Los Angeles, California. I’d be happy to take your money and property when you die, which I hope is not soon of course . . . not too soon.

Alana reminds Vince that Daniel is his only child. Vince replies, “Then he should have known how his hateful words would hurt me.” Al ana says, “What did he say exactly?” meaning what were the words that Daniel u sed that made Vince so angry. Vince says, “He said he has become a San Fra ncisco Giants fan. A Giants fan!” he says in frustration. The San Franci sco Giants are a professional

baseball team. As often happens in sports, differen t teams become rivals, meaning they compete against each other and have a particular dislike for each other.

Here in California, we have several different profe ssional baseball teams, including the San Francisco Giants and my favorite team, which is the Los Angeles Dodgers. Sometimes two teams in particular are enemies of each other even more than they are of other teams, and that’s the case with the Giants and the Dodgers. Vince is saying that his son has becom e a San Francisco Giants fan, and we can guess that Vince is a Dodger fan. A lana is surprised that Vince is so angry about this.

She says, “That’s it?” meaning that’s the only thin g he did to make you mad and to make you want to disown him? Vince is shocked: “ That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core!” The phrase “to the core” (core) me ans completely and entirely. “To wound” (wound) someone is to hurt someone, eith er physically or, as is the case in our dialogue, psychologically or emotionall y. Vince is saying that his son has really hurt him by becoming a fan of the San Fr ancisco Giants, and frankly, I can understand what Vince is talking about here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vince: That’s it! I’ve had it with Daniel defying m e at every turn. I want him to follow in my footsteps and study law, but he wants to be an artist. He dates girls I don’t approve of. But this! This is beyond the boun ds of what I’ll tolerate.

Alana: I know you’re upset, but don’t do anything r ash. I’m sure Daniel didn’t mean what he said.

Vince: Oh, he meant it. That’s it! I’m disowning an d disinheriting him.

Alana: I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke  in anger. I’m sure a cooling- off period of a few days will change his mind.

Vince: It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out of my  will tomorrow. I have other descendants who’ll appreciate inheriting my money a nd property.

Alana: But Daniel is your rightful heir. He’s your only child.

Vince: Then he should have known how his hateful wo rds would hurt me.

 Alana: What did he say exactly?

Vince: He said he has become a San Francisco Giants  fan. A Giants fan!

Alana: That’s it?

Vince: That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core!

This episode is a dialogue between Kiko and Rafael about getting a mortgage loan –  getting money to buy a house. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Kiko: Figuring out how to fill out this mortgage lo an application is like trying to read a foreign language. I don’t know what all thes e terms mean.

Rafael: Let’s see if we can figure it out together.  I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate mortgage. We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate and not worry about the rate going up.

Kiko: All right, I think that’s what we want. We wa nt the principal and interest payments to be predictable.

Rafael: That’s right.

Kiko: And what are points?

Rafael: I think that has to do with fees for gettin g the loan.

Kiko: It looks like we have to get an appraisal of the house we want to buy.

Rafael: Yes, that’s standard, I think.

Kiko: Do we have to pay for private mortgage insura nce?

Rafael: Not if we have a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.

Kiko: Okay, so we don’t need to worry about that ex pense, but what about all these others?

Rafael: Like what?

Kiko: Like homeowners insurance and title insurance ?

Rafael: I’m not sure.

Kiko: And what are balloon payments and prepayment penalties?

Rafael: You got me.

Kiko: And what’s included in the closing costs?

Rafael: I’m really out of my depth here.

Kiko: Me, too. What should we do now?

Rafael: Continue to rent?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kiko saying to Rafael, “Fi guring out how to fill out this mortgage loan application is like reading a foreign  language.” Kiko and Rafael are filling out or completing – putting information  into – a mortgage loan application. A “mortgage (mortgage) loan (loan)” is  money that you get from a bank, that you borrow from a bank to buy a home, to  buy a house or a condominium.

Kiko says that “filling out the application is like  trying to read a foreign language,” meaning it’s very difficult. She can’t understand w hat it is saying. She says, “I don’t know what all these terms,” or words, “mean.”  Rafael says, “Let’s see if we can figure it out together” – let’s see if we can u nderstand it together. He says, “I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjusta ble-rate mortgage.” The “rate” (rate) on a loan is the percentage of money that yo u have to pay on the loan.

So, for example, if you have a loan of $100, and the rate – we would call it the “interest rate” – is 10 percent, that means you hav e to pay $10 on that loan. Here we’re talking about different kinds of rates, two d ifferent kinds of rates for a mortgage. One is a fixed-rate. A “fixed-rate” is wh en the bank tells you, “Okay, we’re going to give you $100,000, or $500,000, and you have to pay every year 5

percent interest, and that will not change. It will  always be 5 percent. It’s “fixed” (fixed).

Another kind of mortgage loan you can get from a ba nk is called an “adjustable- rate mortgage.” The word “adjustable” comes from the verb “to adjust” (adjust). “To adjust” means to change, and an adjustable-rate  mortgage is a mortgage that has a changing rate. So, this year it might be  5 percent, but next year, depending on how the economy is doing, it might be 7 percent. An adjustable- rate mortgage is usually easier to get, however, it ’s unpredictable. You don’t know what your interest rate is going to be 10 year s from now.

Rafael is saying that he thinks they want to get a fixed-rate mortgage. He says, “We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate a nd not worry about the rate going up.” “To lock in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree with someone – in this case, the bank – on a specific nu mber or amount so that it can’t be changed in the future. If the bank says, “ We’re going to charge you 5 percent interest on your loan,” and you say, “Okay,  I want to lock in that rate,” you’re saying you want that rate to be fixed. You d on’t want it to move. You don’t want it to change.

That’s what Rafael is talking about. He wants to “l ock in a good annual percentage rate.” The “annual percentage rate” is t he interest rate for a given year, for each year that you to pay the bank to hav e the money, to borrow the money. Kiko agrees. She says, “All right, I think t hat’s what we want. We want the principle and interest payments to be predictab le.”

When you borrow money from a bank, there are two ki nds of payments that you are making back to the bank. The first is the “prin cipal” (principal). The principal of a loan is the actual money that the bank is givi ng you. So, if the bank is giving you $100, your principal on the loan is $100. But of course, the bank isn’t giving you the money for free. You have to pay the bank to  use its money. The money that you pay the bank – the price of the loan, if y ou will – is the interest.

The interest is the money you pay to get the loan, or the money you pay that the bank gets for giving you the loan. Usually when you  have a mortgage loan in the United States, or a car loan, you are giving the ba nk part of the principal back each time you send in money, but you are also givin g them part of the interest. Kiko says, “We want the principal and interest paym ents to be predictable.” “To be predictable” means you know what they’re going t o be in the future. “Predictable” comes from the verb “to predict” (pre dict), which means to guess or estimate what will happen in the future.

Rafael agrees with her. He says, “That’s right.” Ki ko then asks Rafael to explain to her the meaning of the word “points” (points). W ell, the word “points” can mean a couple of different things, but here, when we’re talking about mortgage loans, it refers to an additional price that you have to pay in order to get the loan. It’s an additional price that you pay besides the interest for the loan. Usually it’s money that you have to give the bank before you even get the loan. “Points” refers to a percentage of the loan that you have to pay as a fe e to the bank.

So, on our $100 loan, we might have to pay 10 perce nt interest, which would be $10 every year that we have the loan, but in additi on, when we get the loan, we have to give the bank perhaps a dollar or two dolla rs. Those payments would be called “points,” and they have to be, usually, paid  when you first get the loan. Rafael says, “I think that has to do with fees for getting the loan,” and Rafael is correct.

Kiko then says, “It looks like we have to get an ap praisal of the house we want to buy.” An “appraisal” (appraisal) is an official est imate – when someone comes in and says, “This is how much your house is really wo rth.” You get an expert, someone who knows a lot about houses, to come and l ook at the house and say, “Well, this house is worth $200,000,” or “This cond ominium is worth $150,000.” Most banks will ask an expert to go and look at you r house and give it an appraisal.

The bank doesn’t want to give you more money for the house than it’s worth. So, the loan amount has to be less than the appraisal a mount. So if you want to borrow, say, $100,000 on a condominium, and the ban k sends a person out, an expert whom we would call an “appraiser,” to look a t the condominium and the appraiser decides it’s only worth $50,000, the bank  isn’t going to give you a $100,000 loan, because the appraisal wasn’t high en ough to justify a loan of that size.

Rafael says, “Yes, that’s standard, I think.” The e xpression here, “That’s standard,” means that’s normal – that’s what you no rmally have to do when you get a mortgage loan; and again, Rafael is correct. Kiko then asks, “Do we have to pay for private mortgage insurance?” “Private mortg age insurance,” sometimes abbreviated “PMI,” is basically insurance that you get in case for some reason you can’t pay off your loan. The bank wants to be s ure it is going to get its money back.

So, private mortgage insurance is money that you, t he borrower, the person getting the money, has to pay in order to make sure  that in case there are any problems with your payments, the bank gets its mone y – from an insurance

company, in this case. Rafael says, “Not if we have  a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.” A “down  payment” is money that you have to give the bank in order to get the loan to b egin with.

Usually the down payment is a certain percentage of  the price of the house. It may be 10 percent. It may be 20 percent. That means  if you’re buying a $200,000 house, and the bank says you have to make a 20 percent down payment, the bank is saying you have to give the ba nk $40,000 before the bank will give you money to buy the rest of the house, o r to pay for the rest of the house. So, the $40,000 is part of the price of the house, but the money goes to the bank.

The bank wants to be sure that you are going to giv e them the rest of their money that they are loaning you. Sometimes, if you have a big down payment – if you put a large percentage of the cost of the ho use in as your down payment – you don’t have to buy the private mortgage insuranc e.

Kiko then says, “Okay, so we don’t need to worry ab out that expense” – that cost – “but what about all these others?” Rafael says, “ Like what?” Kiko says, “Like homeowners insurance and title insurance.” “Homeown ers insurance” is insurance you buy in case something bad happens to your house – in case you have a fire or there is an earthquake, perhaps, whi ch is not uncommon here in California. Homeowners insurance is insurance that will help you rebuild your house or fix your house in case it’s damaged.

“Title insurance” refers to special insurance that you buy in case there’s some problem with the legal documents related to the own ership of your house. The “title” of a house or the “title” of a car is not t he name of the house or the car. It refers to the legal document, the legal agreement, that says who owns this house or this car.

Kiko asks about “balloon payments and prepayment pe nalties.” A “balloon (balloon) payment,” in the context of a mortgage lo an, refers to a large amount of money that you have to pay at the very end of your loan period. Let’s say you have a loan for 10 years. At the end of that 10 yea rs, usually, when you have a balloon payment, you have to give a large amount of  money at the very end to pay off the loan.

Kiko also asks about “prepayment penalties.” For so me loans, you actually get a penalty if you pay the loan early. That’s the meani ng of “prepayment” – to give the bank more money than you are supposed to accord ing to your agreement. A “penalty” is a punishment – something you have to p ay, usually, in the case of a

 prepayment penalty. It’s extra money that you have to give the bank if you are paying your loan off – that is, giving the bank bac k all of its money – early.

Why does a bank charge prepayment penalties on mort gage loans? Well, because they make more money if you continue to pay  the interest on the loan every year. So, some banks have a prepayment penalt y, but not all of them. Rafael doesn’t understand these terms, the ones abo ut balloon payments and prepayment penalties. That’s why he responds to Kik o by saying, “You got me.” “You got me” in this context means “I don’t underst and either.” I don’t know the answer to that question either.

Then Kiko asks, “And what’s included in the closing  costs?” The closing costs are the expenses, the money that you have to pay when t he loan is approved. In order to get your money from the bank to buy the ho use, you have to make sure all of the fees and costs of the loan are taken care of, or paid for, and that’s what is referred to here as “closing costs.” Closing cos ts are separate from the actual price of the home.

Once again, Rafael does not know the answer to this  question. He says, “I’m really out of my depth (depth) here.” If you are “o ut of your depth,” you don’t understand something. You are in a situation that i s too complicated for you. You’re in a situation where you don’t know how to g et out of it. You don’t know what you are doing, basically.

Kiko says, “Me, too. What should we do now?” Rafael  asks, “Continue to rent?” In other words, instead of buying a house, they’ll just continue renting because getting a mortgage loan is too complicated for them .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kiko: Figuring out how to fill out this mortgage lo an application is like trying to read a foreign language. I don’t know what all thes e terms mean.

Rafael: Let’s see if we can figure it out together.  I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate mortgage. We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate and not worry about the rate going up.

Kiko: All right, I think that’s what we want. We wa nt the principal and interest payments to be predictable.

 Rafael: That’s right.

Kiko: And what are points?

Rafael: I think that has to do with fees for gettin g the loan.

Kiko: It looks like we have to get an appraisal of the house we want to buy.

Rafael: Yes, that’s standard, I think.

Kiko: Do we have to pay for private mortgage insura nce?

Rafael: Not if we have a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.

Kiko: Okay, so we don’t need to worry about that ex pense, but what about all these others?

Rafael: Like what?

Kiko: Like homeowners insurance and title insurance ?

Rafael: I’m not sure.

Kiko: And what are balloon payments and prepayment penalties?

Rafael: You got me.

Kiko: And what’s included in the closing costs?

Rafael: I’m really out of my depth here.

Kiko: Me, too. What should we do now?

Rafael: Continue to rent?

This episode is a dialogue between Florence and Ale xander about getting new drugs, especially new drugs that need to be approve d by the government. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Florence: A package came for you. I think it’s from  overseas.

Alexander: Oh, those are my drugs.

Florence: You’re buying your medication from overse as?

Alexander: I have no choice. This drug isn’t FDA-ap proved yet.

Florence: Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug that is n’t approved?

Alexander: Not if it’s been approved in other count ries. This drug is considered experimental here, but has been used in other count ries safely for years.

Florence: But shouldn’t you just wait? How long cou ld the process take anyway?

Alexander: You have no idea. It can take years for a drug to be approved here, especially those that aren’t fast-tracked.

Florence: That’s hard to believe.

Alexander: It’s true. First, it has to be tested on  animals or in a lab, and then it has to go through clinical trials. Only then is it put through a rigorous review by the FDA, which alone can take years.

Florence: You’re right. I had no idea.

Alexander: In the meantime, I’m suffering needlessl y.

Florence: You can’t legally import the drug for you r own use, right?

Alexander: That’s right, but I feel like I have to circumvent the law to get the medicine I need.

Florence: So how does it feel to be an outlaw?

Alexander: Um, healthy?

[end of dialogue]

Florence begins our dialogue by saying to Alexander , “A package came for you.” A “package” would be like a small box or perhaps an  envelope. When something “comes for you,” it arrives for you, usually in the  mail. Florence says, “I think it’s from overseas.” In the United States we use the ter m “overseas” (overseas) to refer to other countries.

Now technically, in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are  not overseas because you don’t have to go over an ocean – “sea” is another w ord for “ocean” – in in order to get there, but it’s a general term we use to mea n from a foreign country, from another country – specifically, from Europe or Asia  or Africa – if you’re in the United States, that is.

Alexander says, “Oh, those are my drugs.” “Drugs” a re medication, medicine that you take because you are sick, or for some other re ason. Some people take drugs even when they’re not sick. You’ll sometimes hear the word “drugs” used to mean illegal drugs (drugs like cocaine, heroin, and marijuana) but it can also be used to refer to what we call “prescription drug s” – drugs that you get from your doctor because you are sick – or simply drugs such as aspirin or other kinds of drug you can buy without the approval of a docto r.

Florence says to Alexander, “You’re buying your med ication from overseas?” “Medication” is just another word for drugs – thing s that you take to make you feel better or to get healthy. Alexander says, “I h ave no choice” – I have no option. “This drug isn’t FDA-approved yet.” “To be approved” means that someone or some organization says it’s okay to use or to buy. The “FDA” is the official government organization in the United Stat es that approves of drugs. FDA stands for “Food and Drug Administration.”

 Florence says, “Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug t hat isn’t approved?” Alexander responds, “Not if it’s been approved in other count ries.” Florence is asking if he, Alexander, thinks it is dangerous to take a drug th at has not been officially approved for use in the United States. Alexander sa ys no, it’s okay if it has been approved by other countries’ governments.

“The drug,” he continues, “is considered experiment al here, but has been used in other countries safely for years.” When we say a dr ug is “experimental,” we mean that we are still researching it, we are still exam ining it. We’re not sure if it’s safe yet. It’s not ready for everyone to use. “Experimen tal drugs” usually are drugs that have not yet been approved for the average per son to use. They can only be used in experiments that are carried out – conducte d – by researchers and scientists.

Florence says, “But shouldn’t you just wait? How lo ng could the process take anyway?” Florence thinks that Alexander should wait  until the FDA approves of the drug for use here in the United States. Alexand er has different ideas. He tells Florence that, in fact, in the United States, it ca n take many years – a very long time – for a drug to be approved.

He says, “You have no idea,” meaning you don’t real ly understand the situation here. “It can take years for a drug to be approved here, especially those that aren’t fast-tracked.” The expression “fast-tracked”  (tracked) refers to something that is done more quickly than usual – something th at would normally take a long time, especially in the approval of some plan or id ea, that is instead approved very quickly. Governments sometimes, if there is a serious illness or disease that is affecting people, “fast-track” – approve somethi ng more quickly than they would normally otherwise do.

Florence says, “That’s hard to believe.” Alexander says, “It’s true. First, it has to be tested on animals or in a lab.” When we test dru gs on animals, we give the drug to an animal and see if the animal dies. For s omething to be “tested in a lab” means that scientists and researchers look at the d rug in a laboratory. The word “lab” (lab) is short for “laboratory,” which is a p lace where scientists conduct their experiments.

Alexander says, “Then it,” meaning the drug, “has t o go through clinical trials.” “Clinical (clinical) trials (trials)” are research studies that doctors do on a small group of humans, of people who are sick, to make su re that the drug is safe. Clinical trials are required for most drugs that are approved by the FDA in the United States. You have to test the drug on a group  of people to make sure that

it’s safe for the average person. Many times, you can get paid to participate in these clinical trials. The government or drug compa nies will give you money to participate in the experiment.

Alexander says, “Only then is it” – again, the drug  – “put through a rigorous review by the FDA, which alone can take years.” A “ rigorous (rigorous) review (review)” is a very thorough, detailed investigatio n of something – when you look at something very closely to make sure that everyth ing is okay. Alexander says that the FDA’s review alone can take years.

The word “alone” here means by itself – not includi ng all of the other steps, all of the other things that have to happen in order for t he drug to get approved. If you say a person is “alone,” you mean that the person i s by him or herself. There are no other people with that person. Here, it refers t o the fact that just this one thing, just this one part of the process, can take many ye ars, not including the time it would take for all the other things to occur.

Florence says, “You’re right, I had no idea,” meani ng “I wasn’t aware of this. I didn’t know this before you told me. Oh, Alexander,  you’re so smart. I love you.” Oh, no – she doesn’t say that. Maybe Alexander is t rying to impress Florence; maybe Alexander is interested romantically in Flore nce and he’s just telling her all of these things so that Florence will fall in l ove with his intelligence. You think? Nah. Anyway, back to our story.

Alexander says, “In the meantime” – meaning while I  am waiting for the FDA to approve of this drug – “I’m suffering needlessly.” If something is done “needlessly” (needlessly), it is being done without  a good reason, without a good cause. Alexander is saying that by waiting, he woul d be suffering. He would be in pain, say, more, without any reason to, because he could get this drug from another country.

Florence, however, reminds Alexander – or asks him,  in any case – “You can’t legally import the drug for your own use, right?” “ To import” (import) means to bring something into a country from another country . In the United States, normally it’s not legal for you to buy drugs in ano ther country and bring them into the United States if those drugs are not legal alre ady in the U.S.

Alexander says, “That’s right” – that’s correct; I can’t do that. “But,” he says, “I feel like I have to circumvent the law to get the m edicine I need.” “To circumvent” (circumvent) means to go around something. Usually it’s used to mean to find a way to avoid rules and restrictions that you don’t want to follow – to do something that isn’t necessarily allowed by the rules, but al lows you to do what you want to

do. In the case of Alexander, he’s circumventing the law. He’s really breaking the law, going against the law, by bringing these drugs  in, but it is something that he thinks is helping him.

Florence says, “So how does it feel to be an outlaw ?” The word “outlaw” (outlaw) is an older term for a person who breaks the law, s omeone who has done something illegal, but has not yet been arrested or  caught by the police. Florence is asking Alexander how it feels “to be an outlaw” – to be a criminal, in effect. Alexander says, “Um, healthy?” meaning he feels hea lthy. He feels better, and he feels better because, in fact, he was able to br ing these drugs illegally into the United States in order to make him feel better, in order to help cure him of whatever disease he has.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Florence: A package came for you. I think it’s from  overseas.

Alexander: Oh, those are my drugs.

Florence: You’re buying your medication from overse as?

Alexander: I have no choice. This drug isn’t FDA-ap proved yet.

Florence: Isn’t it dangerous to take a drug that is n’t approved?

# Working Part-Time Jobs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,072 – Working Part-Time Jobs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,072 I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Luisa and Max ab out working a job less than 40 hours a week – that is, a part-time job. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Luisa: Are you still here? I thought you got off at  three o’clock.

Max: I picked up a second shift. I could use the mo ney.

Luisa: But I thought you had another part-time job in the evenings.

Max: I normally do, but the restaurant where I work  has been cutting back my hours, so I’m trying to pick up as many extra shift s here as I can.

Luisa: And don’t you work at the amusement park on the weekend?

Max: I do half the year, but it’s winter and the pa rk only keeps a skeleton crew on during these months. In the meantime, I’m working f or a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignments.

Luisa: I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.

Max: I have no choice. I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.

Luisa: Have you ever thought about going back to sc hool to qualify for other work, something full-time?

Max: Sure, all the time. I’d like a better job, one  with benefits and a reliable salary.

Luisa: What’s stopping you?

Max: I have to pay for something called “food,” and  I haven’t met my fairy godmother yet!

[end of dialogue]

Luisa begins her dialogue by saying to Max, “Are yo u still here?” This is one of those questions you ask when you’re surprised about  something – obviously Luisa can see that Max is still wherever they are. She says, “I thought you got off at three o’clock.” “To get off of work” means to fi nish your work schedule, to be able to leave the place where you work. If someone says, “What time do you get off?” they mean “What time do you get off of work?”  When do you stop working? What time do you stop working?

Max says, “I picked up a second shift.” A “shift” ( shift) refers to a period of time when people work. Usually this term is used for job s when people work at that particular location more than eight hours, or that there are people working at that location for more than eight hours. It might be, for example, a place where there is someone working 24 hours a day. Well, one person  is not going to work 24 hours straight, so they break up the day into shift s.

So, if you work the day shift, you’re working proba bly from eight in the morning until around four or five in the afternoon. If you working the night shift, you’ll be working perhaps from four or five in the afternoon to midnight. If you’re working what we call the “graveyard shift,” you’re working probably from 11:00 at night or midnight to seven or eight in the morning. Those are “shifts,” then – divisions of the workday in a place that usually is open for mor e than eight hours.

Max says he “picked up a second shift.” “To pick up ” here means to get, to obtain. He was working one shift, and now he’s pick ed up a second shift – which means, of course, he’s working more than eight hour s a day. Why has Max done this? Well, he says, “I could use the money.” When someone says, “I could use the money,” he means that he would be able to benef it from getting more money. He has some need of extra money.

Luisa says, “But I thought you had another part-tim e job in the evenings.” A “part- time job” is a job usually that is less than 40 hou rs per week. In the United States, 40 hours per week is considered “full-time. ” If it’s less than 40 hours, we might call it “part-time.” Luisa thought that Max h ad another part-time job. Max says, “I normally do, but the restaurant where I wo rk has been cutting back my hours.”

 When we talk about someone “cutting back” on someth ing, we mean that he is using less of it or he is reducing the number of so mething. The two-word phrasal verb “to cut back,” then, means to reduce the numbe r of something – in this case, we’re talking about the restaurant where Max works cutting back his hours. His “hours” refers to the number of hours that he can w ork. Max says he’s trying to pick up “as many extra shifts here as I can.”

Luisa then asks, “And don’t you work at the amuseme nt park on the weekend?” An “amusement (amusement) park” is a large park usu ally that has lots of what we would call “rides” in them – places where people , especially children, can play games and get into these machines that go really fa st, for example. Disneyland is an example of an amusement park here in Southern Ca lifornia.

Luisa asks if Max is still working at an amusement park on the weekends. He says “I do half the year,” meaning I do work there part of the year, “but it’s winter and the park only keeps a skeleton crew on during t hese months.” Max is saying that that the amusement park where he normally work s in the summertime only has a skeleton crew during the wintertime. The phra se “skeleton (skeleton) crew (crew)” refers to a very small number of workers – the minimum number of workers you can have at a place.

If the business doesn’t have very many customers, i t might have very few employees, and we might call that a “skeleton crew”  if during busy times the company has more employees. This is the case with t he amusement park. It has a skeleton crew. The word “crew” just refers to a g roup of people. The word “skeleton” is normally used to describe the bones of your body or the bones of an animal.

Max says, “In the meantime,” meaning during this wi nter season, “I’m working for a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignment s.” A “temp (temp) agency” is a company that finds people temporary jo bs. The word “temp” is short for temporary, meaning short-term – not permanent, not for a long time. There are, of course, many companies that find workers, f ind people to work for companies that just need workers for a short period  of time.

Max says the temp agency gives him “short-term assi gnments.” “Short-term” refers to a short amount of time – perhaps a week, perhaps even a day. I used to work for temp agencies when I was in college. I wou ld call up every morning and see if they had any work for me, and they would sen d me to jobs that would last maybe one day, maybe two or three days, sometimes a s long as a month. Temp

agencies are very popular now, especially when the economy is not doing so well. Companies don’t want to hire employees full-t ime.

Luisa says, “I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.” The verb “to juggle” (juggle) usually refers to throwing objects up in t he air and keeping them up in the air. We refer to someone who does this as a “ju ggler,” but here the verb means to handle many different things at the same t ime, to be able to do many different things at the same time. Max says, “I hav e no choice” – I have no other option – “I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.” “To piece (piece) together” something means put together, to assemble. An “income” (income) refers to the money you get from working.

Max is saying that he has to work a little bit at t his job and a little bit at that job in order to make enough money to pay for his rent. Lui sa says, “Have you ever thought about going back to school to qualify for o ther work, something full- time?” “To qualify (qualify) for” something means y ou have the skills and/or education in order to be able to do something. So f or example, if you want to be a doctor, you have to study for many years in order  to qualify for that kind of job – at least, I hope you study many years if you’re a d octor. If not, please don’t to be my doctor.

Luisa is asking if Max has thought about going back  to school to qualify for some kind of job that would be full-time, that would be 40 hours a week. Max says, “Sure, all the time,” meaning I have thought of it a lot. He says, “I’d like a better job, one with benefits and a reliable salary.” “Ben efits” (benefits) refers to things such as health insurance and vacation time and sick  pay – money you get when you can’t work because you’re sick. These are commo n benefits that you get when you have a full-time job.

“Salary” (salary) refers to money that you get to w ork at a certain place, usually by the month or by the year. When we talk about a s alary, we’re talking about money you get regardless of how many hours you work . There are two kinds of ways of getting paid – one is by the hour, when you  get paid a certain amount of money for every hour you work. Another way of getti ng paid is by salary. When you’re getting paid on a salary, we would say you a re getting a certain amount of money and are expected to do your job, even if it t akes more than the normal 40 hours a week.

Luisa says, “What’s stopping you?” What’s preventin g you from going back to school? Max says, “I have to pay for something call ed ‘food.’” Max is making a joke here. He’s saying that he can’t afford to go b ack to school. He doesn’t have

enough money to go back to school because in additi on to paying his rent, he also has to eat, and to eat he has to buy food.

He finishes by saying, “I haven’t met my fairy godm other yet.” A “fairy (fairy) godmother (godmother)” is a character from children ’s stories – stories that we tell children – usually involving a woman who has s ome sort of magical powers. The fairy godmother is a common character in certai n fairytales that are told to children. These are made up stories about magical e vents. Here, Max is using the expression to mean that he hasn’t found someone  who’s just going to give him money to pay for his expenses and to go to scho ol.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Luisa: Are you still here? I thought you got off at  three o’clock.

Max: I picked up a second shift. I could use the mo ney.

Luisa: But I thought you had another part-time job in the evenings.

Max: I normally do, but the restaurant where I work  has been cutting back my hours, so I’m trying to pick up as many extra shift s here as I can.

Luisa: And don’t you work at the amusement park on the weekend?

Max: I do half the year, but it’s winter and the pa rk only keeps a skeleton crew on during these months. In the meantime, I’m working f or a temp agency, which gives me short-term assignments.

Luisa: I don’t know how you juggle all these jobs.

Max: I have no choice. I have to piece together an income if I want to pay rent.

Luisa: Have you ever thought about going back to sc hool to qualify for other work, something full-time?

Max: Sure, all the time. I’d like a better job, one  with benefits and a reliable salary.

Luisa: What’s stopping you?

 Max: I have to pay for something called “food,” and  I haven’t met my fairy godmother yet!

# Seeking Asylum

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,073 – Seeking Asylum.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,073. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and take a look  at our ESL Podcast Store. It has some courses in Business and Daily English. All of our courses can be downloaded immediately. Go to ESLPod.com and check them out.

This episode is a dialogue between Julie and Ed abo ut people who need to leave their home country and go to a different country be cause they’re not safe where they’re living now. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julie: The government is out to get me. I feel like  I don’t have any real freedom and everything I do is being monitored.

Ed: Maybe you should move to another country.

Julie: I guess that’s one solution.

Ed: Yes, you should seek asylum in another country.

Julie: Become a refugee? I’m not sure I want to do that.

Ed: Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted,  you should look for other options.

Julie: That seems a little extreme.

Ed: People who are being treated unfairly because of their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to emigrate.

Julie: I’m not sure I’d go that far.

Ed: I urge you to think about it. Other countries h ave resettlement programs for refugees, and not every country will have reached t heir quota yet this year. You might still find a country that will take you.

Julie: I didn’t say that I wanted to renounce my ci tizenship. I was just letting off steam.

Ed: That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow- through and no courage of your convictions. You all  need to man up!

[end of dialogue]

Julie begins our dialogue by saying to Ed, “The gov ernment is out to get me.” When you say someone or some organization is “out t o get” you, you mean that the person is trying to create problems or difficul ties for you. If someone says, “My teacher is out to get me,” he means that the te acher doesn’t like him and is trying to do something bad to him. Usually when tha t happens, it’s the student’s fault, of course. As a teacher, I have to say that.

Julie says, “I feel like I don’t have any real free dom and everything I do is being monitored.” “Freedom” is the ability to choose what  you want to do and do it when you want to do it. We can talk about freedom a s it relates to political expression, of giving your opinion. We could talk a bout “religious freedom” – the ability to practice the religion that you want. All  of these are kinds of freedoms.

Julie says she doesn’t feel like she has any real f reedom and that everything she does “is being monitored.” “To monitor” means to wa tch or observe something, especially if you are trying to see whether that th ing is changing. Here, we think Julie is referring to the government watching her a ctions and making sure she doesn’t do anything the government doesn’t like. Ed  says, “Maybe you should move to another country.” Julie says, “I guess that ’s one solution” – that’s one answer to this problem.

Ed says, “Yes, you should seek asylum in another co untry.” “To seek asylum” (asylum) means to go to another country, or to the officials of another country, and ask for permission to live in that country. Usu ally people seek asylum when they don’t feel safe in the country where they are living now, perhaps because the government is persecuting them. “To persecute” (persecute) someone is to treat someone unfairly, often because of their poli tical or religious beliefs. When that happens, people sometimes seek asylum. They tr y to go to a different country.

Julie says to Ed, “Become a refugee?” She means, “D o you mean I should become a refugee?” A “refugee” (refugee) is a perso n who has to leave his or her home country, often because there is a war or there ’s some situation making it unsafe for the person to live there. You could have  political refugees. You could have refugees for other reasons as well. Perhaps th ere was a natural disaster or something bad has happened in a country. People lea ve that country to try to go to another country. We call those people “refugees. ”

Julie says, “I’m not sure what I want to do.” Ed sa ys, “Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted, you should look for other options .” Julie says, “That seems a little extreme.” When we describe something as bein g “extreme” (extreme), we mean that it is too much of something, that it’s a very large amount of something. In this case, it means perhaps that the solution th at Ed is proposing is too “drastic,” we could say. It goes too far. Maybe she  can do something that doesn’t require her to actually leave the country and go to  another country.

Ed continues, “People who are being treated unfairl y because of their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to em igrate.” The term “religious beliefs” refers to the kind of religion that you pr actice. In some countries it can be very dangerous not to be of the religion of the maj ority, and that would be a case where you might be persecuted for your religious be liefs.

Ed says that people who are being treated unfairly “have the option to emigrate.” “To emigrate” (emigrate) means to leave one country  to go to another country. Now, we have another word that sounds quite similar , which is “immigrate” (immigrate). Really, the two words mean the same th ing, or refer to the same action. They just emphasize a different aspect of t hat action. If you “emigrate” from one country, you “immigrate” to another countr y.

So, someone could say, “I immigrated to the United States.” That means that person came here. However, the same person could sa y, “I emigrated from Ireland” (or from Japan, or from Columbia). “To emi grate” puts the emphasis on leaving the country where you’re living now. “To im migrate” puts the emphasis on coming to the country where you have arrived. Julie  says, “I’m not sure I’d go that far.” She’s not sure if she wants to actually leave  the country.

Ed, however, says, “I urge you to think about it.” “To urge” (urge) someone means to encourage someone, to tell that person tha t you strongly believe that he or she should do this certain thing, this action . Ed says, “Other countries have resettlement programs for refugees.” “Resettlement”  refers to the process of helping people come to a new country and adapt to t he life there. We usually use this term when we’re talking about a large group of  people, typically political or

religious refugees who are leaving their home count ry and coming as a group to another country.

When I was growing up, for example, in the 1970s, t here were a lot of refugees from Vietnam. Those refugees participated in a rese ttlement program where the U.S. government helped them to come to the United S tates and find housing for them and find them jobs and so forth. “Resettlement  programs” are usually run by the government, although sometimes private organ izations participate in that as well.

Ed says that “not every country will have reached t heir quota yet this year.” A “quota” (quota) is usually the maximum or the minim um number of people that you can have – or it could be for a certain number of anything, really, that you can have. For example, if you are a salesperson – y ou work selling things to other companies – your company may give you a quota . They may say, “You have to sell a thousand dollars every week of our p roduct or service.” That thousand dollars is your quota.

If you sell a thousand dollars, then we would say y ou have “met” (met) your quota. The verb would be “to meet” a quota. “Quota”  here refers not to money, but to people. Many countries, including the United  States, have a limit to the number of people they will accept as immigrants eac h year. That number is the quota – in this case, the maximum number of people that they will accept. Ed is saying that some countries have not yet reached the ir quota this year – presumably, their quota for refugees. “You might st ill find a country that will take you” – that will accept you.

Julie says, “I didn’t say I wanted to renounce my c itizenship. I was just letting off steam.” “To renounce (renounce) your citizenship” i s to say that you no longer want to be considered part of a certain country. If  you renounce your American citizenship, you’re saying, “I no longer want to be  an American. I don’t want to be legally considered an American.” Usually that means  that you no longer have an American passport. In fact, in all cases I think it  would mean that.

Julie says, however, that she does not want to reno unce her citizenship. She was just “letting off steam” (steam). The expression “t o let off steam” means to say something or to do something that expresses your fr ustration, your anger, your irritation, but it is not meant to be taken too ser iously. Someone who is letting off steam is someone who is perhaps yelling, shouting, or saying things about another person – complaining about something as a w ay of getting those emotions out, to release those negative feelings th at they have.

It’s a psychological thing. You don’t really want to do some of the things perhaps even that you say when you are letting off steam. E d, however, says, “That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow-through and no courage of your convictions. You all need to man up !” From the dialogue, we’re guessing that Ed is older than Julie – perhaps quit e a bit older – because she refers to her as being a member of a group that he considers “young people.”

He says that “young people today have no follow-thr ough.” “Follow-through” refers to completing or finishing the actions that you’ve started. “Follow-through” means getting something done, completing something – not stopping halfway through, not quitting before you’ve finished. The e xpression “courage of your convictions” refers to a confidence and perhaps the  certainty that what you are doing is right. Your “convictions” are your beliefs . “To have the courage of your convictions” means to really believe what you say a nd therefore be willing to act on those beliefs, those convictions.

That’s why Ed ends our dialogue by saying, “You all ” – meaning you young people, including Julie – “need to man up.” “To man  up” is a somewhat recent phrasal verb that has become popular. It means to b e brave, to be courageous. Usually it’s addressed to men. If you say to a man,  “You should man up,” you’re saying that the man should take responsibility, to do what a man would do – to be strong, to be courageous.

Here, however, Ed is addressing it to a whole group  of people, which is a little unusual, but we understand what he’s saying here. H e’s saying that Julia and the other people who have similar convictions should fo llow through. They should do what they say they want to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Julie: The government is out to get me. I feel like  I don’t have any real freedom and everything I do is being monitored.

Ed: Maybe you should move to another country.

Julie: I guess that’s one solution.

Ed: Yes, you should seek asylum in another country.

Julie: Become a refugee? I’m not sure I want to do that.

 Ed: Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted,  you should look for other options.

Julie: That seems a little extreme.

Ed: People who are being treated unfairly because of their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to emigrate.

Julie: I’m not sure I’d go that far.

Ed: I urge you to think about it. Other countries h ave resettlement programs for refugees, and not every country will have reached t heir quota yet this year. You might still find a country that will take you.

Julie: I didn’t say that I wanted to renounce my ci tizenship. I was just letting off steam.

Ed: That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow- through and no courage of your convictions. You all  need to man up!

# Becoming a Vegetarian/Vegan

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,074 – Becoming a Vegetarian.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,074. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Ashley and Paul about people who don’t eat meat. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ashley: I’m thinking of becoming a vegetarian. I th ink it would be the ethical thing to do.

Paul: Are you going to eat eggs and dairy? If you’r e doing this for ethical reasons, you really should avoid anything made with  animal products or animal by-products.

Ashley: I guess you’re right.

Paul: Then you’re going to be a vegan. You won’t be  able to eat any milk, butter, cheese, or yogurt.

Ashley: Really? I guess I’ll have to be a vegan the n.

Paul: You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’t  have a vitamin deficiency.

Ashley: Yes, I’ll have to guard against that.

Paul: Are you going to avoid buying things that are  animal-derived, too? Like leather shoes and belts?

Ashley: I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I shoul d.

Paul: Are you having second thoughts?

Ashley: No, I just didn’t know there would be so ma ny restrictions.

 Paul: Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fr uitarian.

Ashley: What’s that?

Paul: You don’t want to know.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ashley saying to Paul, “I’ m thinking of becoming a vegetarian.” A “vegetarian” (vegetarian) is a perso n who doesn’t eat meat, the meat of animals such as cows or pigs or chickens. A  vegetarian might not eat meat for a variety of reasons. In the case of Ashle y in our story, it’s because she thinks it is “the ethical thing to do.” “Ethical” ( ethical) refers to something that is good – the right or correct thing to do in a situat ion, the moral thing to do. That’s what Ashley thinks being a vegetarian is all about – being ethical.

Paul says, “Are you going to eat eggs and dairy?” “ Dairy” (dairy) is something that is related to milk – milk itself, or other thi ngs that are made from milk. Paul is asking Ashley if she is going to eat eggs and milk,  since those things come from animals even though they are not animals themselves . Paul says, “If you’re doing this for ethical reasons, you should really avoid a nything made with animal products or animal by-products.”

There are two terms here to explain. The first is “ animal products.” A “product” is something that comes from something else, something  that is produced. “Animal products” would be anything that is made from one o r more parts of an animal. “Animal by-products” (by-products) are things that are made from animal parts, usually created as a consequence of making somethin g else.

For example, chicken farmers mainly try to get eggs  from chickens, or they kill the chicken in order to sell the meat of the chicke n, but one of the by-products of having chickens is that chickens, like most of us, create a certain waste product. They – well, to put it in the terms of a young chil d, they “poop” (poop). “Poop” is what you do when you go to the bathroom – well, at least one of the things.

Anyway, I’m not sure how we got on this topic. Oh y es, animal by-products are things that animals produce or that you get from an  animal in the process of doing something else or making something else. I th ink that would be the general idea. So, in the case of chicken poop, it would be perhaps to make fertilizer – something you would put on the ground so that you c ould grow food more easily.

Ashley says, “I guess you’re right,” meaning that s he agrees with Paul that she should probably not eat eggs or dairy. Paul says, “ Then you’re going to be a vegan” (vegan). A “vegan,” if I understand correctl y, is a person who doesn’t eat any animal products. That means that vegans not onl y don’t eat meat, they don’t eat eggs or use any dairy products.

Paul says, “You won’t be able to eat any milk, butt er, cheese, or yogurt.” “Butter,” you may know, is something that is made in part fro m cream and has typically a lot of fat in it. “Cheese” is a solid food made fro m milk. We use cheese in all sorts of cooking. Lots of Italian pasta dishes, for examp le, have cheese in them. Paul also talks about “yogurt” (yogurt). Yogurt is also made from milk, often something that is sweetened with fruit or sugar, especially t he kind of yogurt you buy at the store that has flavors like strawberry.

Ashley says, “Really? I guess I’ll have to be a veg an then.” Paul continues; he says, “You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’ t have a vitamin deficiency.” A “diet” refers to the kinds of food that you eat. “V aried” means that you need to eat different kinds of things, and the reason Paul is t elling Ashley she needs to eat different kinds of food is to avoid a “vitamin (vit amin) deficiency (deficiency).”

A “deficiency” is when you don’t have enough of som ething. So, a vitamin deficiency is when you don’t have enough vitamins. “Vitamins” are usually classified by a letter – vitamin A, vitamin C, vita min D. There various different kinds of vitamin B. Vitamins are necessary for heal th, and they can be found in many different kinds of food, depending on the vita min.

Ashley says, “Yes, I’ll have to guard against that. ” “To guard (guard) against” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to pre vent something from happening, to protect yourself from something dange rous that might happen. You can guard against something physical like someone t rying to hit you, but more often than not, we use the expression “to guard aga inst” when we’re talking about things that we want to avoid doing – things t hat we want to prevent from happening.

Paul says, “Are you going to avoid buying things th at are animal-derived too?” The word “derived” (derived) comes from the verb “t o derive.” “To derive” means to get something from somewhere else. We could talk  about words in English that are “derived” from words in Latin or in French  or in German. Here, the expression in the dialogue is “animal-derived,” whi ch would mean that it comes from, or is made from, animals.

Paul says, “Like leather shoes and belts?” “Leather ” (leather) is a material made from the skin of an animal, usually a cow. Paul is telling Ashley that she’s going to have to stop buying leather shoes and belts. A “ belt” (belt) is what goes around the top of your pants to keep them from falling dow n. Ashley says, “I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I should,” meaning “I su ppose I should avoid buying things that are animal derived also.”

Paul then asks, “Are you having second thoughts?” I f someone asks you if you’re having second thoughts about something, it means th at they are asking you if you are doubting your decision, if you are thinking  about changing your mind, because maybe now when you think about it a little more, you think you might have made the wrong decision. That’s “’having secon d thoughts.”

If you ask a young woman to marry you and she goes home and comes back and tells you that she’s having second thoughts abo ut actually getting married to you, that’s usually not a good sign. You probably want to find a new girlfriend. Anyway, Ashley says “No,” meaning no, I’m not havin g second thoughts. I’m not doubting my decision. “I just didn’t know there wou ld be so many restrictions.” “Restrictions” are limits on what you can do – rule s or regulations that prevent you from doing certain things.

Paul then says, “Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fruitarian.” A “fruitarian” (fruitarian) is a person who eats main ly fruit, usually fruit that falls off from a plant or a tree and that can be taken withou t harming the plant or tree. So, it’s not just fruit that you might find on a tree. Usually fruitarians, if I understand correctly, will only eat fruit that has fallen off of a tree – naturally, if you will. Are there really fruitarians in the world? Well, Dr. Lu cy Tse thinks so, because she put the word in our dialogue.

Ashley says, “What’s that?” She doesn’t know what a  fruitarian is. Paul says, “You don’t want to know.” When you hear that expres sion, “You don’t want to know,” the person is indicating that this informati on that you don’t know might be information that you don’t really want to know, bec ause it will confuse you or make you angry or perhaps make you sad. When someon e says, “You don’t want to know,” they’re saying that the information that you are asking about is something that is going to hurt you or perhaps upse t you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ashley: I’m thinking of becoming a vegetarian. I th ink it would be the ethical thing to do.

Paul: Are you going to eat eggs and dairy? If you’r e doing this for ethical reasons, you really should avoid anything made with  animal products or animal by-products.

Ashley: I guess you’re right.

Paul: Then you’re going to be a vegan. You won’t be  able to eat any milk, butter, cheese, or yogurt.

Ashley: Really? I guess I’ll have to be a vegan the n.

Paul: You’ll have to eat a varied diet so you don’t  have a vitamin deficiency.

Ashley: Yes, I’ll have to guard against that.

Paul: Are you going to avoid buying things that are  animal-derived, too? Like leather shoes and belts?

Ashley: I hadn’t thought of that. I suppose I shoul d.

Paul: Are you having second thoughts?

Ashley: No, I just didn’t know there would be so ma ny restrictions.

Paul: Just be glad you didn’t choose to become a fr uitarian.

Ashley: What’s that?

Paul: You don’t want to know.

[end of dialogue]

Thanks to our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse,  who is not a fruitarian.



# Defying Orders

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,075 – Defying Orders.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,075. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. I know, it’s a l ittle crazy.

Our website is ESLPod.com. There’s nothing crazy ab out that. If you go there, you can become a member of ESL Podcast. How cool is  that?

On this episode, we’re going to have a dialogue bet ween Carol and Miguel about someone who doesn’t do what he is told to do – some one who defies orders. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carol: Hey, where are you going?

Miguel: We can’t sit here doing nothing.

Carol: We have orders to stay here and to keep watc h. You know as well as I do what the consequences are of defying orders.

Miguel: I don’t care what kind of punishment I get.  I can’t sit still and let things happen without an attempt at intervention.

Carol: What are you going to do, enter the fray wit hout a plan?

Miguel: I have a plan. I’m going to stop what’s going on using whatever means necessary.

Carol: By doing what? Have you thought this through ?

Miguel: I’ll get the lay of the land and then formu late some options. Everything will work out.

Carol: And I suppose you expect me to go with you, to stick my neck out, too?

Miguel: That’s up to you. I’m not twisting your arm .

Carol: How do you know that if I stay here, I won’t  squeal on you?

Miguel: I don’t. I guess I just have to rely on you r sense of honor.

Carol: Oh, come on, let’s go.

Miguel: You’re coming with me?

Carol: Against my better judgment!

[end of dialogue]

Carol begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey, where are you going?” Miguel says, “We can’t sit here doing nothing.” Carol says, “We have orders to stay here and keep watch.” So, Carol is asking Miguel where he is  going, and Miguel says that he doesn’t want to just sit there and do nothing, b ut Carol says that the two of them “have orders.” If you say you “have orders,” y ou mean that someone has given you instructions – someone has told you what you are supposed to do, usually someone in authority.

You can think about the military – for example, the  army or the navy – where one of the leaders will give orders to the other member s of the military, telling them what to do. Miguel and Carol’s orders are to keep w atch. The phrasal verb “to keep watch” (watch) means to monitor something – to  observe something, but not to do anything or get involved with that thing.

So, if you are keeping watch, for example, in front  of a building, you are watching to see what is going on, usually because you’re loo king for a problem. If there is a problem, then you’re supposed to call someone els e and that other person will deal with or take care of the problem. Or you might  be keeping watch because you are expecting someone to arrive, and the person  who gave you the orders to keep watch wants you to tell him or her when the ar rival takes place.

Carol says, “You know as well as I do what the cons equences are of defying orders.” A “consequence” is a result of something, something that happens as a result of something else. There’s an old expression , “Ideas have consequences,” that means that when you have certain moral, religi ous, political, or ethical opinions about things, ideas about things, those id eas often have practical results in the real world. They actually will influence the  way people behave, the way people act.

Here, Carol is talking about the consequences “of d efying orders.” “To defy” (defy) means to refuse to do something, to say no t o someone who has authority over you. Carol reminds Miguel that there are conse quences for defying orders. Miguel says, “I don’t care what kind of punishment I get.” A “punishment” is a negative consequence or a negative result, usually something that you get because you did something wrong.

Miguel says, “I can’t sit still and let things happ en without an intervention.” “To sit still” means to not move, to remain in one place. I f you are keeping watch, you may also be sitting still – that is, you’re not mov ing around, you’re just staying where you are. But Miguel says he cannot “sit still  and let things happen without an intervention.”

An “intervention” (intervention) is the act of beco ming involved in something, especially to change the process or the result of s ome action. We could speak of a “military intervention,” where one country sends its army or its military into another country in order to prevent something bad f rom happening in the other country – or at least, that’s what the normal excus e is for military interventions.

We also use the term “intervention” nowadays perhap s more commonly to refer to a situation where a person has a problem with dr ugs or alcohol. The person’s friends and family want to tell this person to stop , to get help, and so they may put this person in a room and all of them together will talk to the person and try to convince the person to get help with his or her dru g or alcohol problem. That’s an “intervention.”

Carol says, “What are you going to do? Enter the fr ay without a plan?” “To enter the fray” (fray) means to become involved in a figh t, argument, or disagreement – to join into a situation that is hostile, or perhap s people are yelling at each other or even fighting physically with each other. Miguel  says, “I have a plan” – I have an idea about what I’m going to do – “I’m going to stop what’s going on using whatever means necessary.”

The word “means” (means) here refers to the method,  the manner, or the approach that you use in order to get something don e. “Whatever means necessary” is used in a situation where you will do  anything. You will do whatever it takes in order to get the result you want to get . Carol is still confused about what Miguel plans to do. She asks, “By doing what?”  – “What exactly are you going to do, Miguel?” she’s asking.

She asks, “Have you thought this through?” “To thin k something through” is to think carefully about something – to think of all t he possible consequences of

your actions, to really understand what you are doi ng, including what might go wrong or what problems you might face as you do thi s action. Miguel then gives us a little bit of his plan. He says, “I’ll get the  lay of the land and then formulate some options. Everything will work out.”

“To get the lay (lay) of the land” means to underst and the way things are organized by looking at the situation or by looking  at a particular place. Physically, “to get the lay of the land” would be t o understand where everything is – where the roads are, where the streets are, where  the houses are – in a given area. It can be used more generally to mean to unde rstand the way things are organized, the way an organization or business is o rganized, for example.

Miguel says that he will “formulate some options.” The verb “to formulate” (formulate) means to come up with or develop someth ing, to think of something. Miguel says, “Everything will work out.” If someone  says, “It’s going to work out,” he means that it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be successful. There aren’t going to be any problems.

Carol says, “And I suppose you expect me to go with  you, to stick my neck out, too?” “To stick your neck out” is an expression mea ning to take a risk, to do something that might cause you harm or injury or pu t you in danger. Miguel says, “That’s up to you,” meaning that’s your decision; I ’m not going to force you. In fact, the next sentence is “I’m not twisting your a rm.”

“To twist (twist) someone’s arm” is to persuade som eone to do something that the person doesn’t really want to do – to force the  person to do something. If you can think of your arm and someone putting your arm behind your back in a painful way, then you understand where this express ion comes from. “To twist someone’s arm” – to make them do something because you are pressuring them.

Carol says, “How do you know that if I stay here” –  if I don’t go with you – “I won’t squeal on you?” “To squeal (squeal) on” someone mea ns to report someone’s bad behavior to someone else – to tell someone else , usually someone in authority, about bad things that someone else has d one.

Miguel says, “I don’t,” meaning I don’t know if you  will squeal on me or not. “I guess I just have to rely” (or depend) “on your sen se of honor.” A “sense of honor” (honor) is wanting to do the right thing, the ethical thing, the moral thing. Carol says, “Oh, come on, let’s go.” Miguel asks, “ You’re coming with me?” He’s surprised that Carol is going to go with him.

Carol says, “Against my better judgment!” The expre ssion “against one’s better judgment” means that you don’t agree with what this  person is saying or what this person wants to do, but you’re going to do it anyway. You’re going to go “against your better judgment” – against your own r eason, against the logic in your own mind, and instead, you’re going to do what  this person wants you to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carol: Hey, where are you going?

Miguel: We can’t sit here doing nothing.

Carol: We have orders to stay here and to keep watc h. You know as well as I do what the consequences are of defying orders.

Miguel: I don’t care what kind of punishment I get.  I can’t sit still and let things happen without an attempt at intervention.

Carol: What are you going to do, enter the fray wit hout a plan?

This episode is a dialogue between Nick and Jessica  about selling things using the name of a famous person. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick: The possibilities are endless! You have to ta ke advantage of being at the height of your career.

Jessica: I don’t know about lending my name to a ce lebrity product line. Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?

Nick: Of course not. Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame into a successful business.

Jessica: But licensing my name to a lot of products  that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my time.

Nick: But think of the upside. You would be buildin g a brand with longevity, hedging your bets for the future.

Jessica: You mean in the future when I’m no longer as famous or as popular.

Nick: No, of course that’s not what I mean. You’ll be a star forever. But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is  good?

Jessica: I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are  we talking about?

Nick: We can start with a clothing line and then br anch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.

 Jessica: Weight-loss products?! What are you implyi ng?

Nick: Nothing! I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I meant food – glamorous, beautiful food. See what I mean? The sky’s the limi t!

[end of dialogue]

Nick begins our dialogue by saying to Jessica, “The  possibilities are endless.” A “possibility” is something that could happen. When we say something is “endless” (endless), we mean that there is no maximum – it co uld be as many as possible. “The possibilities are endless,” then, means that t here are many possibilities. Usually we’re talking about good things that could happen.

Nick says to Jessica, “You have to take advantage of being at the height of your career.” “To be at the height (height) of your care er (career)” means that you are at the best moment or the most successful moment in  your line of work, in what you do. Your “career” is your job. It’s the thing t hat you do to make money, usually. “To be at the height” of something means t o be at the highest point – to be at a point where, in this case, you are the most  successful. Perhaps you are making the most money that you will ever make, or y ou are more popular than you will ever be.

Jessica says, “I don’t know about lending my name t o a celebrity product line.” “To lend” (lend) means to let someone use something  for a period of time. Jessica is talking about “lending her name.” “To le nd your name” means to let your name be associated with something else. In the  United States, it’s popular for certain movie stars or music stars to lend thei r name to certain products, things that companies sell. Sometimes they actually  sell the product using the name of the person.

So, for example, there might be a kind of perfume t hat is sold using the name of some famous actress or singer. “Perfume” (perfume) is liquid that you put on your body to make you smell nice. Usually we use the term “perfume” to refer to what a woman would put on her body. Jessica doesn’t  know about – she’s not sure about – lending her name to a celebrity produc t line. A “celebrity” (celebrity) is a famous person. A famous actor, a famous singer , a famous podcaster – all of these could be celebrities, except that last exampl e.

“Product” refers to something that you sell. A “pro duct line” is a group of products, a group of related things that you would sell. So, a “celebrity product line” would be a group of things that are sold usin g the name of a famous person.

Jessica says, “Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?” The phrasal verb “to sell out” has a couple of different meanings. Here it me ans to do something in order to make money, but to do something that somehow doe sn’t match with your principles or your morals or your values or your id entity, even.

So, for example, a popular singer writes a song. the song becomes a “hit,” meaning it becomes very successful, and then a few years later, the singer will sell this song, or the rights to use the song, to a  company in order for the company to use that song in a commercial. Some peop le would say that the artist, the singer, has “sold out.” “He sold out,” meaning he’s decided that he was going to get money for what he wrote rather than ke eping himself as a real artist.

I don’t know if this is really true – if you could consider someone selling their song to be “selling out” – but that’s the idea behi nd the phrasal verb “to sell out.” The other possibility or the other possible meaning  of the verb “to sell out” would be for a store to sell all that it has of a certain  product – to no longer have any available because they have all been sold.

Nick doesn’t think Jessica would be selling out. He  says, “Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame i nto a successful business.” “To leverage” (leverage) means to use something tha t you have now in order to get something better in the future. “To leverage yo ur influence,” for example, would mean to use your influence in order to get a better situation, or perhaps to make more money. “Leveraging your celebrity” would be to use your fame, the fact that you are popular, in order to make even mo re money, or perhaps to become even more famous.

Jessica says, “But licensing my name to a lot of pr oducts that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my tim e.” Jessica is saying that she doesn’t want to license her name to a lot of produc ts. “To license” (license) means to allow or to let another company or another  person use something that you have created. You might, for example, write a s ong, and then you let another person use that song in order to make money. You wo uld “license” the song to that person, meaning that person has to give you so me money for using your song.

Jessica doesn’t want to have to promote a lot of pr oducts. “To promote” here means to let people know about something – to go ou t and tell people, in this case, to buy these products. When a writer publishe s a book, he or she often goes and promotes the book by going on television p rograms and radio interviews and that sort of thing.

Nick says, “But think of the upside.” The “upside” (upside) of something is the advantage of something, the good result or conseque nce that can happen if you do a certain thing. The upside of saving a lot of m oney now when you’re young is that when you are old, you will have money to live on. The “upside” is the advantage. The opposite of “upside” is, of course, “downside” (downside). The downside of something would be the disadvantage, the negative consequence of some action.

Nick says, “You would be building a brand with long evity, hedging your bets for the future.” A “brand” (brand) is a name or a symbo l that is associated with a certain kind of product. You can think of, for exam ple, the kind of toothpaste that you use in the morning to clean your mouth, to brus h your teeth. The toothpaste is made by a certain company. The name would be the  brand of that toothpaste. Often that same brand, that same name, will be used  with the whole set of products, a “line” of products, we might call them.

“Longevity” (longevity) refers to how long somethin g lasts; usually it refers to a long life or a long existence. Nick is talking abou t Jessica’s brand as having longevity. It will survive for many years. This wil l allow her “to hedge her bets.” “To hedge (hedge) your bets (bets)” means to reduce  your risk, to protect yourself against bad things that might happen in the future. Nick is saying here that if Jessica gives her name to all of these diff erent products, she would make a lot of money now, and then she wouldn’t perhaps h ave to worry about making money in the future.

Jessica says, “You mean in the future when I’m no l onger as famous or as popular?” Nick says, “No, of course that’s not what  I mean.” Jessica is concerned that sometime in the future, she won’t be popular. Nick doesn’t want her to think that – doesn’t want her to think that Nick believes  that someday she won’t be popular. Of course, we all know that eventually cel ebrities lose their popularity, are no longer popular.

Nick says, “You’ll be a star forever,” meaning you will be famous forever. “But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is good?” There are two expressions here. The first one is “a piece of the pie” or “to get a piece of the pie” (pie). “To get a piece of the pie” here refers to g et part of something, to obtain a part of something, often some amount of money. And that’s what Nick is talking about here. A “pie” is normally a dessert that you eat, but here it’s referring simply to getting some money that is available to b e got.

The second expression is “while the getting is good .” “While the getting (getting) is good” means to get something before it disappear s – to get something while

there is still an opportunity to get it. Jessica sa ys, “I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are we talking about?” “Merchandise” (m erchandise) are products, things that you can buy, things that are sold by co mpanies. “Merchandise” usually refers to physical products. Jessica wants to know what kind of merchandise Nick is talking about.

Nick says “We can start with a clothing line, and t hen branch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.” A “clothing line” would be clothes that are sold under a particular name – shi rts, pants, dresses, that sort of thing. The phrasal verb “to branch (branch) out” me ans to go into a different area, a different kind of, in this case, product from the  one that you started with. A celebrity might start with selling shirts that have  his name on it, and then he could branch out and sell pants and shoes and socks and o ther types of clothing. That would be “branching out.”

Nick is suggesting that Jessica can branch out into  all sorts of things after she starts selling clothing. One of the things you can start selling in the future is “weight-loss” products. “Weight loss” refers to bec oming thinner, losing some of the weight that you have, not being as fat as you a re now. I mean, I’m not saying you’re fat – you, who are listening to this episode  – but you know, people in general. Americans have this problem. Jessica says,  “What are you implying?” She thinks that Nick is calling her fat, and of cou rse, you never want to call a woman fat.

Nick says, “I’m not implying anything,” meaning I’m  not saying that you are overweight. “I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I mean” – and then he changes his idea – “food – glamorous, beautiful food. See w hat I mean?” – meaning “Do you understand me?” – “The sky’s the limit!” The ex pression “the sky’s (sky’s) the limit” means that there are many, many possibilitie s – many things that you can do. There are no limits. There are no restrictions.  You have a lot of choices, usually good choices.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nick: The possibilities are endless! You have to ta ke advantage of being at the height of your career.

Jessica: I don’t know about lending my name to a ce lebrity product line. Wouldn’t people think I was selling out?

 Nick: Of course not. Most celebrities do it nowadays. People expect you to leverage your fame into a successful business.

Jessica: But licensing my name to a lot of products  that I would then have to promote isn’t exactly how I want to spend my time.

Nick: But think of the upside. You would be buildin g a brand with longevity, hedging your bets for the future.

Jessica: You mean in the future when I’m no longer as famous or as popular.

Nick: No, of course that’s not what I mean. You’ll be a star forever. But don’t you want to get a piece of the pie while the getting is  good?

Jessica: I don’t know. What kind of merchandise are  we talking about?

Nick: We can start with a clothing line and then br anch out into household products, luggage, and even weight-loss products.

Jessica: Weight-loss products?! What are you implyi ng?

Nick: Nothing! I didn’t mean weight-loss products. I meant food – glamorous, beautiful food. See what I mean? The sky’s the limi t!

# Buying Travel Insurance

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,077 – Buying Travel Insurance.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,077. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, of course.

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Josette and Tae-jin about buying insurance before you take a trip. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Josette: I admit it. I’m a nervous traveler and I d on’t like traveling internationally.

Tae-jin: You could get travel insurance. Doing that  would make you feel more secure, wouldn’t it?

Josette: Maybe. What types of coverage are availabl e?

Tae-jin: You could get insurance to cover mishaps o n the trip, such as cancelled flights or missed connections and having your lugga ge lost, stolen, or damaged. It’ll even cover your losses if your trip is cancel led.

Josette: I guess that would help, but I’m more nerv ous about something happening to me while I’m in another country.

Tae-jin: In that case, you can get medical insuranc e to cover the costs of medical emergencies, even if you have to be medically evacu ated in the event of serious injuries or illness.

Josette: Oh, you’re right. I could get really sick or injured.

Tae-jin: And if things go terribly wrong, there’s e ven insurance for if you become disabled or if there’s an accidental death. They’ll  pay for repatriation of your remains or overseas funeral services.

Josette: Disabilities and death? Is that supposed t o put my mind at ease?

Tae-jin: The whole point is to make you less worrie d about bad things happening while you travel.

Josette: Right, and right now the only insurance th at seems to be foolproof is staying put!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue in this episode is about travel insura nce. “Insurance” (insurance) is an agreement that you sign with some company – call ed an “insurance company,” of course – in which you give the company  some money, and if something bad happens to you in the future, the com pany will pay for whatever bad happens to you.

So, for example, if you buy “car insurance,” you gi ve the insurance company money every year, and if you have an accident, the insurance company will pay for most or all of the repairs that need to be done  to your car. Why would the insurance company do this? Well, because most peopl e don’t have accidents. And so, you’re paying the insurance company money, and usually you won’t get any of that money back, but if you do have an accid ent, well, then the insurance company will pay for it.

Insurance companies need lots of different people t o buy insurance from them so that they can make money, since only a small percen tage of people will actually need the insurance – only a small percentage of peo ple will actually get money back from their insurance policy, their insurance a greement.

Our dialogue, then, begins with Josette saying, “I admit it. I’m a nervous traveler and I don’t like traveling internationally.” Tae-ji n says, “You could get travel insurance.” “Travel insurance” is a special kind of  insurance that will pay for any problems you might have while you are traveling. Ta e-jin says that “Doing that” – that is, buying travel insurance – “would make you feel more secure, wouldn’t it?” “To feel secure” (secure) means to feel safe, to fe el like you’re not in danger, that nothing bad will happen to you.

Josette says, “Maybe,” meaning “Well, maybe it will  make me feel secure.” She then asks, “What types of coverage are available?” “Coverage” (coverage) refers to the kinds of things that the insurance will pay for – the kinds of “protection,” we might say, that are provided by the insurance polic y or agreement. Tae-jin

replies, “You could get insurance to cover mishaps on the trip, such as canceled flights or missed connections and having your lugga ge lost, stolen, or damaged.”

“Mishaps” (mishaps) are accidents – something negat ive or unfortunate that happens that usually you can’t avoid. A mishap is u sually something not too serious that has happened. If someone dies, we prob ably wouldn’t call that a “mishap.” But if, for example, you fall on the grou nd and are not hurt to seriously, that might be considered a mishap. It’s an unlucky accident. Then we get a list of examples of mishaps. One would be “canceled flights ,” meaning the airline, the company that owns all of the airplanes, decides tha t it’s not going to fly your plane to the place where you want to go.

“Missed connections” refers to when you are flying from one place to another but have to go to a third place before you arrive at yo ur final destination. So, for example, if you are flying from Los Angeles, Califo rnia, to New York City, you might have to first fly to Chicago and then get on another plane that flies you to New York. That second flight, that second plane, wo uld be your connection. We would say, “You have to make a connection in Chicag o.”

A “missed connection” would be a situation where yo ur first plane arrives too late and you no longer are able to get onto the second p lane. Losing your luggage is also a possible mishap that travel insurance might pay for. “Luggage” refers to your baggage – the suitcases that you bring with yo u that have your clothes and other items in them.

Tae-jin says that travel insurance even covers your  losses if your trip is canceled. Your “losses” refers to the amount of money that yo u lose when something bad or unfortunate happens. If your flight is canceled – if the airline is not going to fly the plane as it said it would to your destination, to the place where you want to go – you might lose money on a hotel room that you alr eady paid for and can’t get your money back on.

Josette says, “I guess that would help, but I’m mor e nervous about something happening to me while I’m in another country.” Tae- jin says, “In that case, you can get medical insurance to cover the costs of med ical emergencies.” “Medical insurance” refers to insurance that pays for when y ou have an accident or when you’re sick.

“Medical emergencies” would be things that require immediate attention, serious situations related to your health. If you break you r leg while skiing, for example, which happened to my brother-in-law not too long ag o, that would be a medical emergency. He was in another country, and he had to  go to the hospital.

Someone has to pay for that, and if he had medical insurance, the insurance company would probably pay for most of that. (As, i ndeed, it did.)

Sometimes you need to leave the country and be brou ght back to your own country. This would be a case of a “medical evacuat ion.” The verb is “to evacuate” (evacuate). “To evacuate” someone means t o move them from a dangerous place to a safer place. In this case, it may not be that the place where you are is dangerous. It may be instead that the pl ace where you are doesn’t have the kind of medical services you need, so that  you have to be taken to another hospital in another country.

Josette says, “Oh, you’re right. I could get really  sick or injured.” Tae-jin says, “And if things go terribly wrong, there’s even insu rance for if you become disabled or if there is an accidental death.” If so mething goes “terribly wrong,” it goes very wrong – something very bad happens. What could happen? Well, you could become disabled. “To be disabled” (disabled) means that you have something bad happen to your body so that you can no longer work, or perhaps even walk. That would be a case of being disabled o r becoming disabled.

An “accidental death” would be when you die, not be cause someone murdered you or killed you, like your wife, but because ther e was some sort of accident – something unexpected happens. Tae-jin says that the  insurance companies will pay for “repatriation of your remains or overseas f uneral services.” “Repatriation” (repatriation) is when something is brought back to  the country from which it originated – usually a person, or in this case, you r dead body.

Your “remains” (remains) refer to what’s left of yo ur body. Sometimes nowadays people have their body “cremated” – that is, burned . So, your remains would be what remains after they burn your body – which woul d be your ashes – or your remains could be your actual physical body, with yo ur head and your arms and your legs and so forth.

The insurance companies, if you have travel insuran ce, could pay for “repatriation of your remains or overseas funeral s ervices.” “Overseas” refers to in another country. “Funeral” (funeral) is some sor t of ceremony or service that takes place when a person dies. Usually it involves  your friends and family coming together to talk about you or to perform som e sort of religious ceremony or participate in a religious ceremony.

Josette says, “Disabilities and death? Is that supp osed to put my mind at ease?” Tae-jin, remember, was trying to make Josette feel calmer, more secure about traveling, and now he’s talking about her dying and  being buried, having a

funeral. Josette asks Tae-jin if what he is telling  here is supposed to put her mind at ease. “To put your mind at ease” (ease) means to  make you feel calmer and less worried – to make you feel as though nothing b ad is going to happen.

Tae-jin says, “The whole point is to make you less worried about bad things happening while you travel.” Josette says, “Right,”  meaning yes, that’s right, “and right now, the only insurance that seems to be fool proof is staying put.” “Foolproof” (foolproof) is something that cannot fa il, that cannot go wrong – something that will work always, that will never ca use any problems.

What Josette is saying here is that instead of buyi ng insurance and traveling, the best way to be safe and secure is simply to stay pu t. “To stay put” is a phrasal verb meaning not to move, not to go anywhere.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Josette: I admit it. I’m a nervous traveler and I d on’t like traveling internationally.

Tae-jin: You could get travel insurance. Doing that  would make you feel more secure, wouldn’t it?

Josette: Maybe. What types of coverage are availabl e?

Tae-jin: You could get insurance to cover mishaps o n the trip, such as cancelled flights or missed connections and having your lugga ge lost, stolen, or damaged. It’ll even cover your losses if your trip is cancel led.

Josette: I guess that would help, but I’m more nerv ous about something happening to me while I’m in another country.

Tae-jin: In that case, you can get medical insuranc e to cover the costs of medical emergencies, even if you have to be medically evacu ated in the event of serious injuries or illness.

Josette: Oh, you’re right. I could get really sick or injured.

Tae-jin: And if things go terribly wrong, there’s e ven insurance for if you become disabled or if there’s an accidental death. They’ll  pay for repatriation of your remains or overseas funeral services.

 Josette: Disabilities and death? Is that supposed t o put my mind at ease?

Tae-jin: The whole point is to make you less worrie d about bad things happening while you travel.

Josette: Right, and right now the only insurance th at seems to be foolproof is staying put!

# Watching Action Movies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,078 – Watching Action Movies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,078. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Download a Learning guide for this episode. You can do that by becoming a member of ESL Podcast . On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogue between Jean and Clau de regarding movies that have a lot of excitement in them. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?

Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and  this is a thriller.

Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless acti on movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.

Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you o n the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.

Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those al ready, too.

Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a li fe-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.

Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action m ovie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the ad renaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.

Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action  film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?

Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent f ight scene is over.

[end of dialogue]

Claude begins the dialogue by saying, “Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?” An “action (action) movie” is a movie that has  usually a lot of fighting, a lot of car chases, often a lot of violence. Action movies have a hero – a good guy – and then one or more bad guys that the good guy, of  course, fights. Jean says, “Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and this  is a thriller.” A “thriller” (thriller) is also an exciting movie, but instead of having a lot  of fights or violence, it involves a lot of surprise or even fear.

Now, sometimes there can be violence in a thriller as well, but a thriller would be a movie during which you are waiting to see what wi ll happen. You’re going to be surprised at what happens. In an action movie, you’ re often not surprised at what happens. You kind of know what’s going to happen – the good guy is going to win. But in a thriller, there’s more of what we wou ld call “suspense” (suspense) – when you don’t know what’s going to happen.

Claude says, “This definitely seems like a brainles s action movie to me.” “Brainless” means that it isn’t very smart. It isn’ t very intelligent. Your “brain” (brain), of course, is what’s in your head, or at l east what’s in most people’s heads. I’m not quite sure about my neighbor. “Brain less” (less) would be someone who didn’t have a brain, or not a very big brain. The term “brainless” is an insulting one to describe something you think is  stupid or not very intelligent. Claude says that this is “a brainless action movie”  that Jean is watching.

He says, “That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.” A “fight scene” (scene) is a part of a movie where,  of course, people are fighting. When we talk about “scenes” in a movie, we’re talki ng about different parts or sections of the movie with the same characters or p eople in the same place. Claude says, “This is the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film,” meaning we’ve only been watching the movie f or 15 minutes.

Jean says, “It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep  you on the edge of your seat.” When we say something keeps you “on the edge (edge)  of your seat,” we mean that there’s a lot of excitement, a lot of suspense , a lot of anticipation. Everyone is eager or very much interested in finding out wha t’s going to happen next. A thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you ’re sitting on a chair on the edge of your seat – “seat” is another word for chair – y ou are just about to get up or you are leaning forward towards the front of the ch air. If you’re relaxed, you would be sitting back against the back of the chair .

Jean says, “Of course it’ll have some fight scenes, ” meaning the movie will have some fight scenes even though it is a thriller. Cla ude doesn’t seem to agree with Jean. He says, “And car chases? We’ve had three of those already, too.” A “car

chase” (chase) is when one car tries to catch anoth er car, both of them usually going very fast. Action movies typically have lots of car chases in them. Claude is saying that this isn’t really a thriller because it  has all of the elements, or parts, of an action movie, such as car chases.

Jean disagrees. She says, “Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a life- threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pu rsuit.” A “hero” (hero) is a good guy – the person, man or woman, who is the main cha racter of the movie and is the one that is going to beat, or defeat, the bad g uys. If you’re in a “life- threatening situation,” you’re in a situation where  you could die. And of course, in movies that is often the case.

The hero always fights against a “villain” (villain ). A villain is a bad guy in the movie, the opposite of the hero. Jean calls him “th e evil villain,” but villains are always evil. “Evil” just means bad. Jean says that this movie has “a hero in a life- threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pu rsuit.” The word “pursuit” (pursuit) comes from the verb “to pursue” (pursue). “To pursu e” means to run after or chase after someone – to try to catch someone who i s escaping from you or who is trying to get away from you.

“To pursue” can also mean simply to go on a certain  path to try to obtain some goal. We talk about students “pursuing” a degree in  history. They are trying to get a degree in history. Just like me. What do you do w ith a degree in history? Well, you become a podcaster. Anyway, back to the dialogu e. We have a villain in  hot pursuit. If you say someo ne is “in hot pursuit” of another person, the person is chasing someone very closely,  almost catching him or her. Claude says, “That sounds like a run-of-the-mill ac tion movie to me.” “Run-of-the- mill” is an expression that means ordinary – not ve ry interesting, not unusual. It’s usually used as a way of describing something that isn’t special in any way. It’s just like perhaps a thousand other types of that th ing. “This is a run-of-the-mill microphone.” It’s not a great microphone. It’s an a verage microphone. There’s nothing special about it.

Claude says, “This movie is full of visual effects and stunts.” “Visual” (visual) refers to something you can see. In movies, when we  talk about “visual effects” (effects), we’re talking about things that usually involve using computers or some sort of trick with the camera to make something loo k real when it isn’t, when it isn’t actually there.

“Special effects” are often used to show buildings blowing up or planes crashing to the ground, even though the people who made the movie didn’t actually blow up or destroy a building. They use often, computer software nowadays, or other

special tricks to make it look as though that were happening. “Stunts” (stunts) are dangerous actions that one of the characters in the  movie performs.

Here in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, there are p eople who are what are called “stuntmen” or “stuntwomen,” and they go in a nd do these dangerous actions so that the actor or actress doesn’t have t o. Some actors and actresses, however, like to do their own stunts, meaning they don’t like to have a stunt person doing the dangerous actions in the movie; th ey like to do their own stunts.

Claude says that this movie is “all about the adren aline rush.” When we talk about someone having an “adrenaline (adrenaline) ru sh (rush),” we’re talking about someone who has a sudden feeling of excitemen t, a sudden feeling of extra energy, often in response to stress or danger . Adrenaline is a chemical, a hormone in your body that is released when you are in a dangerous situation, often.

Claude says, “It’s not what I call a psychological thriller.” A “psychological thriller” is a thriller that focuses on the emotions, thought s, and ideas of the main character in order to create this suspense, this an xiety. Think of the movies of Alfred Hitchcock, the great English director of the  twentieth century. He created a lot of interesting psychological thrillers.

Jean says, “Maybe it,” meaning the movie, “straddle s the line between an action film and a thriller.” “To straddle (straddle) the l ine” means to have characteristics of two different things, so that you can’t really t ell what it is. Is it one thing or is it another thing? That’s what Jean is saying about thi s movie. It’s both a thriller and an action movie.

She asks Claude if the movie is good. Claude replie s, “I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent fight scene is over.” We already know  what a fight scene is. If you describe a fight scene as “ultra-violent,” you mean  it is very violent. The term “ultra” (ultra) is sometimes added in front of a wo rd to mean it has a lot of something. It’s a way of saying it is very much thi s thing. So, if we say something is “ultra-violent,” we mean that it is really viole nt or very violent.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claude: Oh no, this isn’t another action movie, is it?

Jean: Of course not. I know you like thrillers, and  this is a thriller.

 Claude: This definitely seems like a brainless acti on movie to me. That’s the second fight scene, and we’re only 15 minutes into the film.

Jean: It’s a thriller that’s supposed to keep you o n the edge of your seat. Of course it’ll have some fight scenes.

Claude: And car chases? We’ve had three of those al ready, too.

Jean: Like any good thriller, it has a hero in a li fe-threatening situation and an evil villain in hot pursuit.

Claude: That sounds like a run-of-the-mill action m ovie to me. This movie is full of visual effects and stunts. It’s all about the ad renaline rush. It’s not what I would call a psychological thriller.

Jean: Maybe it straddles the line between an action  film and a thriller, but it’s good, isn’t it?

Claude: I’ll let you know once this ultra-violent f ight scene is over.

[end of dialogue]

Our scripts don’t have a lot of ultra-violent fight  scenes in them, but we think they’re pretty interesting all the same. Thanks to Dr. Lucy Tse for writing them.



# Receiving Letters and Packages in the Mail

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,079 – Receiving Letters and Packages in the Mail.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,079. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. All the cool kids are doing it. Go to ESLPod.com for more i nformation.

On this episode, we have a dialogue between the Cel este and Anwar about getting things in the mail – the old kind of mail, you know, not email. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: Did the mail come?

Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.

Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has  the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?

Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.

Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have b een delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage  on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.

Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you  received was sent using overnight delivery.

Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.

Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?

Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in  it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.

Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s  been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.

Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Anwar: You know what?

Celeste: What?

Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.

Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate ?

[end of dialogue]

Celeste begins our dialogue by asking Anwar, “Did t he mail come?” Celeste is asking if the mail has arrived, if it has been deli vered. Anwar says, “Yes, you got some letters and packages.” A “letter” is usually a  piece of paper or several pieces of paper put in an envelope and then is give n to the local post office to be delivered to another location – another house or a business.

An “envelope” (envelope) is basically a folded piec e of paper that is glued together so that you can put another piece of paper , your letter, inside of it. You can put other things other than letters, pieces of paper with writing on them, in an envelope. You could also put a photograph in an env elope. Anwar says that Celeste got some letters and a package. The word “p ackage” (package) is usually used to describe a box (it could be a small  box, it could be a very large box) that is sent, again, through the mail – given to the post office or some other delivery service.

Here in the United States, in addition to the post office, we also have other private companies that will deliver your packages a nd letters. You have to pay more money, of course, for that to happen. Celeste says, “Oh, I hope one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us.” Here we see the word “envelope” again, and in this case, the envelope ha s photos in it – or at least, that’s what Celeste hopes is in the envelope. Celes te says , “Did you notice the postmark?”

A “postmark” (postmark) is a little mark, usually m ade with ink, that is put on the package or the envelope when it is mailed. You put a little piece of paper called a “stamp” on the envelope or the package, and then the post office puts ink on that

stamp so that you don’t use the stamp again and so that you know what day the letter or the envelope was processed by the post of fice in order to be delivered.

In the United States, many times official documents  have to be mailed by a certain date, especially things you’re sending to t he government. The governmnet doesn’t require that the envelope arrive  by a certain date, but rather that it be postmarked by a certain date. So, to pay  your income taxes each year, you have to make sure that the envelope is given to  the post office and that the post office puts a postmark on it no later than Apr il 15th. We would say the envelope has to be “postmarked” by the 15th of Apri l. So, “postmark” can be used as a verb, or as a noun to refer to the actual  mark of ink on the envelope or package.

Celeste is asking Anwar if he noticed the postmark,  meaning if he looked at it. Anwar says, “No, but they’re sitting in the hall.” I should mention also that a postmark also usually contains the location of wher e the letter or package was mailed from – the location of the post office. Cele ste says, “Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago.” I f something is “overdue” (overdue), it is past the deadline. It is something  that should have been submitted or should have arrived earlier.

“To be delivered” means to be given to the person f or whom the envelope or the package is intended. Celeste says, “Naomi thought s he might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it mu st have been misdelivered.” “Postage” (postage) is the amount of money that you  have to pay in order to send an envelope or a package. Usually this is done  with what are called “postage stamps” (stamps) which are those little pi eces of paper, with usually a picture on them of a famous person or of a famous p lace in your country, that are then placed on the envelope or the package.

Celeste thought the package might have been “misdel ivered,” meaning it might have been given to the wrong person by the post off ice. That happens of course sometimes. Anwar says, “You can look at it yourself . The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.” “Overnight deli very” is when you give a letter or a package to the post office or to another priva te delivery service, and that package or envelope is delivered the next day. In f act, another word for or term for “overnight delivery” is “next-day delivery,” wh ich is now the more common term.

Celeste says, “I wonder who sent it and why they se nt it using expedited service.” The word “expedite” (expedite) means to make someth ing go faster. So, “expedited service” would be delivery service that is faster than normal, faster

than usual. Anwar is clearly not interested in answ ering all of Celeste’s questions. He says, “I don’t know” – I don’t know w hy they sent it using expedited service. “Why don’t you go look?” meaning stop both ering me and go look at the package yourself. It’s almost certain that Anwar an d Celeste are married.

Celeste says, “I wonder if there is anything perish able in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.” Sometimes you’ll use “expedited servi ce” or “overnight delivery” because you’re sending food that is “perishable” (p erishable). Perishable food is food that has to be put in a refrigerator or a free zer, otherwise, it will go bad. It will rot.

Some people send food that is perishable in special  packages that have ice in them or some other material that keeps them cold. B ut, of course, they need to be placed in a refrigerator or freezer as soon as p ossible. That’s “perishable food” – anything that has to be refrigerated or fro zen. The opposite would be “nonperishable food” – food that comes in cans, for  example.

Celeste also wonders whether the contents of the pa ckage is something that is “time-sensitive.” If something is “time-sensitive,”  it is required to be acted upon or to arrive within a very short period of time. Somet hing that’s time-sensitive is something that has to be done right away, or very s oon, or by a certain deadline. Again, Anwar isn’t interested in answering Celeste’ s questions. He says, “I have no idea. There is also a letter that’s been forward ed from our old address that has delivery confirmation.”

When mail is “forwarded” (forwarded), it is sent to  a different address, usually because someone has moved. If you move from one hou se or apartment to another house or apartment, usually the post office  will forward your mail to your new address even though the address on the envelope  or package is to your old address, to the house where you used to live. Usual ly they’ll do that for three or six months. After that, they may or may not, depend ing on how nice of a post office you have.

“Delivery confirmation” is a special service that t he post office provides, as well as other private delivery companies, where the pers on who is sending the package can check to see if the package has in fact  arrived – if it has been delivered. Celeste says, “Oh, I wonder what that co uld be?” meaning the other letter that had been forwarded. Anwar says, “You kn ow what?” And Celeste responds, “What?” Anwar says, “All of those mysteri es can be solved if you just go and open your mail.”

Anwar is getting impatient now with Celeste. He’s t elling her to just go and open the mail so she doesn’t have to keep asking questio ns wondering what’s in the package and the letter. A “mystery” (mystery) is so mething that you don’t know – something that you want to know, but you don’t have  an answer for. We can talk about a “murder mystery,” where you don’t know who killed a certain person.

Celeste says, “I know, but isn’t it more fun to spe culate?” She realizes she can have her questions answered by just going and openi ng these letters and packages, but she thinks it’s “fun to speculate.” “ To speculate” (speculate) means to wonder or guess about something without having a ny real evidence or proof. The noun form would be “speculation.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: Did the mail come?

Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.

Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has  the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?

Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.

Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have b een delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage  on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.

Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you  received was sent using overnight delivery.

Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.

Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?

Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in  it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.

Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s  been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.

 Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Anwar: You know what?

Celeste: What?

Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.

Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate ?

# Automating Production

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,080 – Automating Production.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,080. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California – home of Hollywo od, home of the stars, home of ESL Podcast.

And d id you know that we’re on Facebook, too? Yeah. Seriously. Go to facebook.com/ eslpod and like us.

This episode is a dialogue between Lauren and Yves about making or producing things automatically, with machines. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren: Wow, that was an impressive demonstration of how robots can be used in production. I think that we need robots like tho se to automate some of the functions in our factories.

Yves: I admit the demonstration was eye-opening, bu t I don’t think the technology is there yet to allow us to replace peop le with robots.

Lauren: No, not for many of the functions, but we c ould have them do some of the more routine and hazardous tasks.

Yves: You mean have them work alongside our current  workers? I’m not sure how our workers would take it. Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?

Lauren: Not with their sophisticated sensors, which  allow them to avoid other people or machines.

Yves: I don’t know. Introducing automation would be  tricky.

Lauren: What’s important is that they’ll increase p roduction and reduce accidents. The demonstration showed how easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.

Yves: I’m thinking of the people in the factories. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots?

Lauren: It’s the wave of the future.

Yves: So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing y ou?

Lauren: Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispensable.

Yves: Just like the typewriter?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Lauren saying, “Wow, that was an impressive demonstration of how robots can be used in producti on.” If something is “impressive,” it’s something that we think is very good. It makes an impression on us. It makes us remember it. A “robot” (robot) is a  machine that performs some action, often an action that a human being would do . Robots are often associated with, oh, I don’t know, characters such as R2D2 in Star Wars. That might be considered a robot. The word “production” means man ufacturing – the process of making, building, or creating something.

Lauren says, “I think that we need robots like thos e to automate some of the functions in our factories.” The verb “to automate”  (automate) means to do something that doesn’t require your involvement or the involvement of a human being. We have another very common term, “automatic ally” – an adverb meaning that something is done by a machine or by a compute r that doesn’t require anyone to go and do anything. It just happens. “To automate” is the verb from which we get the adverb “automatically” or the adje ctive “automatic.”

Lauren thinks that her company should get some of t hese robots to automate some of the functions, some of the things that are done in their factories. A “factory” (factory) is a place where things are bui lt – physical things typically like cars or, I don’t know, computers, bookshelves. Actu ally, I did my own bookshelves. I ordered a set of bookshelves from a company, and they send you the wood, right? And then you have to paint the woo d yourself and then put them together. And they look really nice, I think. They’ re in my office. You should come and see them someday.

Anyway, a factory is a place where things are made and then sold to people already put together. (Real men put their own books helves together, you see.) Yves, who is a man – there’s also an English name E ve (Eve), which is a

woman’s name, but here it’s a man’s name because it ’s (Yves) – Yves says, “I admit the demonstration was eye-opening.” When we s ay something is “eye (eye) – opening,” we mean that it provides you info rmation, sometimes surprising information, that you didn’t know before – informat ion that makes you realize the importance of something. It could be something good  or something bad.

Yves says this demonstration, whatever they saw, wa s “eye-opening,” but he doesn’t think “the technology is there yet to allow  us to replace people with robots.” If we say something “isn’t there (there) y et,” we mean it isn’t advanced enough or it hasn’t developed enough to be useful. In this case, it’s not developed enough to allow Yves and Lauren to replac e people with robots, to have robots doing the jobs of humans. Lauren says, “No, not for many of the functions, but we could have them do some of the mo re routine and hazardous tasks.”

Something that is “routine” (routine) is something that happens in the same way over and over again, typically without changing. We  might use also the adjective “repetitive.” “Repetitive” comes from the verb “to repeat” (repeat), which means to do something again – a second, third, fourth, and f ifth time and so forth. “Hazardous” (hazardous) comes from the word “hazard ,” which means danger.

So, something that is hazardous is something that i s dangerous, that could hurt you or perhaps even kill you. We use this word “haz ardous” sometimes with chemicals – liquid or other substances that might b e dangerous. Hazardous chemicals would be chemicals that could hurt you or  even kill you. Here, we’re talking about hazardous tasks – things that you do.  Yves says, “You mean have them work alongside our current workers?” “Alongsid e” (alongside) means next to.

Yves is asking Lauren if she thinks the company sho uld have the robots working next to or alongside the workers, the human workers  they have now. He says, “I’m not sure how our workers would take it.” Here,  the expression “take it” means how they would accept it, how they would reac t to it. He asks, “Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?” If something “gets in t he way,” it prevents you from doing something you would otherwise do. It’s what w e would call an “obstacle” (obstacle).

An “obstacle” is something that gets in your way, t hat prevents you from doing what you want to do. It’s some difficulty you have to overcome, perhaps. Lauren says, “Not with their sophisticated sensors which a llow them,” meaning the robots, “to avoid other people or machines.” A “sen sor” (sensor) is a machine

that is able to measure something. It might be temp erature. It might be distance. It might be some other physical characteristic that  is important.

Usually sensors are put on things so that some othe r action happens when a certain thing is detected. So, you might have a tem perature sensor for example in, I don’t know, your oven, where you cook things,  and when it reaches a certain temperature, the oven may turn off. That’s one poss ible use of a sensor. Lauren says the robots have sensors that will detect wheth er they are close to other people or other machines and therefore not get in t he way.

Yves says, “I don’t know. Introducing automation wo uld be tricky.” Something that’s “tricky” (tricky) is something that’s diffic ult, something that would require very careful planning or very careful implementatio n. When you actually have to do it, you have to be careful how it’s done. Lauren  says, “What’s important is that they’ll” – meaning the robots – “they’ll increase p roduction and reduce or lower the number of accidents. The demonstration showed h ow easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.”

“To program” (program) something means to give it i nstructions – specifically, to give a computer or a machine instructions. We all k now about “computer programming,” which of course is necessary for the machines that we call “computers” to operate. More recently, people have started using the word “coding” (coding) to refer to computer programming because the language, if you will, that computer programming is written in is ca lled “code” (code). Lauren says that these robots can be programmed even when fine calibration is required.

“Calibration” (calibration) is the process of makin g sure that a machine is accurate in what it is doing. For example, if you a re going to weigh something, if you want to see how much something weighs, you use something in English called a “scale” (scale). But the scale has to be c alibrated. You have to make sure that the scale is giving you the correct numbe r, the correct amount. What Lauren is talking about is calibrating robots to ma ke sure that they’re accurate and do exactly what they’re supposed to do.

Yves says, “I’m thinking of the people in the facto ries. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots ?” A “riot” (riot) is a violent protest. The expression “on our hands” means someth ing that is your responsibility and that you have to deal with. Usua lly it’s something negative that happens, something bad that happens, and you have t o deal with it. You have to take care of it. Usually because it’s your responsi bility. Yves is worried that if they put computers – or rather, robots – into the factor ies, they would have a riot on their hands. The workers would protest.

 Lauren says, however, “It’s the wave of the future. ” This expression, “the wave (wave) of the future,” means that it is something t hat will be very common in the near future – within a year or two, or perhaps with in ten years. “The wave of the future” is the way things are going. It’s something  that will be common in the future, even though it’s not very common right now.  Yves says, “So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing you?” “To object (objec t) to” something is a phrasal verb meaning to disagree with someone or something,  to say something is a bad idea.

Yves is asking Lauren if a robot could replace her,  if she would think that’s a bad idea, the way she is proposing to replace workers w ith robots. Lauren says, “Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispen sable.” Something that is “indispensable” (indispensable) is something that i s necessary, something that is required. The opposite would be “dispensable.” If s omething is dispensable, you don’t need it. You can get rid of it. If it’s indis pensable, it is not dispensable; you must have it. Lauren thinks she’s indispensable.

Yves then gives her a comparison, “Just like the ty pewriter?” A “typewriter,” for those young ones out there who don’t know, is a mac hine that we used to use back before computers and are still used in some pl aces, of course, that you don’t need to plug in. Well, I guess you can plug i n electric typewriters, but basically they’re machines used for putting ink mar ks on paper. Instead of having a printer, we had things called a “typewriter.”

I’m joking, of course. Most of you probably remembe r typewriters, but typewriters are no longer used as much as they used to be, and that’s the joke that Yves is making here. Lauren think she’s indispensable, but people thought typewriters would be indispensable, and now they are in fact, f or the most part, dispensable. Although I actually have an old typewriter sitting on my desk, so someday when we don’t have any power here in Los Angeles, I’ll s till be able to type on my typewriter.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren: Wow, that was an impressive demonstration of how robots can be used in production. I think that we need robots like tho se to automate some of the functions in our factories.

 Yves: I admit the demonstration was eye-opening, bu t I don’t think the technology is there yet to allow us to replace peop le with robots.

Lauren: No, not for many of the functions, but we c ould have them do some of the more routine and hazardous tasks.

Yves: You mean have them work alongside our current  workers? I’m not sure how our workers would take it. Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?

Lauren: Not with their sophisticated sensors, which  allow them to avoid other people or machines.

Yves: I don’t know. Introducing automation would be  tricky.

Lauren: What’s important is that they’ll increase p roduction and reduce accidents. The demonstration showed how easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.

Yves: I’m thinking of the people in the factories. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots?

Lauren: It’s the wave of the future.

Yves: So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing y ou?

Lauren: Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispensable.

Yves: Just like the typewriter?

[end of dialogue]

Our scriptwriter is indispensable. We couldn’t live  without her. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse. Will a robot someday  be able to do her job? I don’t think so. She’s just that good.



# Personal Grooming

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,081 – Personal Grooming.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,081. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Giorgio and Anna . Giorgio and Anna are talking about personal grooming – things you do to keep yourself clean and good-looking. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giorgio: I’ll pick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?

Anna: You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get  ready.

Giorgio: You just need to go home, take a shower, a nd throw on some clothes. How much time do you need?

Anna: You have no idea what a woman has to do to lo ok her best, do you? Not only do I have to bathe, I need to exfoliate and de pilate.

Giorgio: “Depilate”?! What’s that?

Anna: That’s shaving and waxing to you. I have to s have and wax my legs, my armpits, and bikini area.

Giorgio: Whoa! That’s way too much information. I d idn’t need to know that.

Anna: After that, I’ll need my nail clippers, nail file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.

Giorgio: I don’t even want to know what you pluck.

 Anna: Just my eyebrows and my . . .

Giorgio: Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and out s of your personal grooming. Is all that really necessary?

Anna: You are going to introduce me to your brother , aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?

Giorgio: I was until I heard all that. I don’t know  if I want my brother dating a woman who’s so high-maintenance.

Anna: High-maintenance? High-maintenance?! Who are you calling high- maintenance?

Giorgio: And high-strung!

[end of dialogue]

Giorgio begins our dialogue by asking Anna, “I’ll p ick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?” “To pick someone up” means usually to drive to their house and to take them somewhere in a car. Anna says, “You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get ready.”

Giorgio says, “You just need to go home, take a sho wer, and throw on some clothes.” Giorgio says that it shouldn’t take Anna long to get ready to go. She just needs to “take a shower” – to wash herself – and to  “throw on,” or put on, some clothes. “Throw on” is a phrasal verb used informal ly the same way we would use the phrasal verb “to put on” when we’re referring t o clothes. Giorgio says, “How much time do you need?”

Anna says, “You have no idea what a woman has to do  to look her best, do you?” I don’t, either. Anna says, “Not only do I ha ve to bathe, I need to exfoliate and depilate.” Anna is complaining that Giorgio, be ing a man, doesn’t understand all the things that a woman has to do, and quite ho nestly, I as a man don’t understand them either, but I’ll try to explain as best I can.

Anna starts by talking about bathing, and that’s the one thing I do understand. “To bathe” (bathe) means to wash yourself, either i n a shower or in the bathtub. “Exfoliate” (exfoliate) means to remove the dead sk in cells from the surface of your skin, usually by rubbing your skin with either  a rough, tough substance or

using some sort of chemical. This is something I’ve  never done, and I don’t know how it’s done, but I am told by women, including my  wife, that it is in fact done.

Something else women apparently do is “depilate.” N ow, I’m so unfamiliar with this concept that I actually had to look up the pro nunciation of that word. Absolutely true. Anyway “depilate” (depilate) is wh en you remove hair from your body. Now I understand why I didn’t know the meanin g of it – and neither does Giorgio, because he says, “‘Depilate’?! What’s that ?” Exactly right, Giorgio.

Anna says, “That’s shaving and waxing to you.” “To shave” (shave) is something I do understand, because men – many men – shave the ir faces. I shave my face every couple of days when I’m not feeling too lazy.  “Waxing” (waxing) is removing hairs from your body by putting on a hot, sticky substance called “wax.” Wax is what we usually make candles out of. It soun ds very painful. I’m told it is very painful, and it’s not something that most men would probably do, but apparently some women do this.

She says, “I have to shave and wax my legs, my armp its, and bikini area.” Well, I understand shaving and waxing your legs, but appare ntly Anna also has to do that to her armpits. Your “armpits” (armpits) are t he areas below your shoulder, between where your arms come into your body and the  main part of your body – the torso or center part of your body.

Most people have hair under their arms in their arm pits. I know I do. But Anna is going to remove that hair, which is again something  apparently women do. Anna also needs to do something with the “bikini area.” A “bikini” (bikini) is a kind of swimsuit that is in two pieces that a woman wears. One piece covers the top – her breasts. The other piece covers the bottom. The  things that you don’t want other people to see, let’s say.

So Giorgio says, “Whoa! That’s way too much informa tion.” “Too much information” means you’re telling someone things th at are too personal, that they don’t need to know. We abbreviate this now in Engli sh “TMI.” If someone is giving you information about their personal life th at you don’t want to know or don’t think you should know, you might say “TMI,” e specially if it’s something that is embarrassing to either you or to the person. Gio rgio, in fact, says, “I didn’t need to know that.” But Anna continues.

She says, “After that, I need my nail clippers, nai l file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.” Your “nails” are the parts of your hand and foot that are on the very ends of your fingers and your toes – the hard substances that grow out of the ends of your fingers and toes. Those are  your “nails” (nails). So, a “nail

clipper” would be something that cuts your nail. the verb “to clip” (clip) means to cut. A “nail file” (file) is a small tool, usually a flat little stick that is rubbed against the nails in order to make them smooth after you cu t them, I guess.

“Tweezers” (tweezers) are small instruments that lo ok like little pliers – like scissors, sort of, but they don’t cut things. They are used to grab onto something that’s very small and remove it. If, for example, y ou pick up a piece of wood and the wood is rough, you might get a little piece of the wood in the skin of your finger. To remove that little piece of wood – what we would call a “sliver” (sliver) – you would use a very small tool called the “tweezer s.” Well, that’s what Anna is using.

Now, why is she using the tweezers? Well, apparentl y in order to do her “plucking” (plucking). “Plucking” comes from the ve rb “to pluck” (pluck), which means to pull out hair from your body, usually usin g a tweezers. Once again, it sounds rather painful. Giorgio, upon hearing this, says what I think most men would say: “I don’t even want to know what you pluc k” (what kind of hairs you’re pulling out).

But Anna tells him – “Just my eyebrows and my . . . ” “Eyebrows” (eyebrows) are the thin rows of hair that grow above your eyes. Wo men sometimes pluck the hairs out of their eyebrows, I’m told, in order to make them look better. This is not something that most men do. I certainly would not d o that. I cut my eyebrows sometimes, but I don’t pluck them. Once again, I’m not used to that kind of pain the way women are, I guess.

Giorgio doesn’t want to know what other hairs Anna plucks. He tells her “Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and outs of your persona l grooming.” The expression “the ins (ins) and outs (outs)” refers to the detai led information about something, the specific information about something. In this c ase, it’s the ins and outs of personal grooming. “Grooming” (grooming) comes from  the verb “to groom,” which means to take care of something in terms of t he physical cleanliness and appearance of it.

So, “personal grooming” would be taking care of you rself – washing yourself, cutting your hair, shaving, and so forth. All the c razy things that women do. Anna says, “You are going to introduce me to your brothe r, aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?” Anna is explaining why she needs  to do all of this personal grooming. It is apparently because Giorgio is going  to introduce her to Giorgio’s brother. “To introduce someone” to someone else mea ns to take someone and have them meet someone that you know.

So, if you have a new girlfriend and you decide to introduce your girlfriend to your parents, you take your girlfriend home with you and  you let your parents meet your girlfriend. That’s usually considered somewhat  of a serious step in a relationship, when you meet the parents – when you meet the parents of your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Well, Giorgio has a b rother who Anna thinks is very handsome, very good-looking. Giorgio says, “I was,”  meaning I was going to introduce you to my brother, “until I heard all tha t,” meaning until I heard about all the things that you do in doing your personal groom ing.

Giorgio says, “I don’t know if I want my brother da ting” – going out romantically with – “a woman who is so high-maintenance.” The ex pression “high- maintenance” (maintenance) is used to describe some thing that requires a lot of work. It’s often used in a negative way to describe  a woman who is very demanding, who requires a lot of attention. I’m not  sure if that’s what Giorgio is referring to here. He does think that Anna takes an  awful long time in order to get ready, and perhaps that’s why he thinks she’s high- maintenance.

Anna considers this an insult, a negative thing to say about her. She says, “High- maintenance? High-maintenance? Who are you calling high-maintenance?” She’s very upset. Giorgio, however, doesn’t apologi ze. Instead, he says, insultingly, “And high-strung!” Someone who’s “high -strung” (strung) is someone who is easily upset, someone who gets mad at the sm allest little thing, or someone who’s just very nervous and very tense (ten se) – someone who’s always very worried, perhaps.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Giorgio: I’ll pick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?

Anna: You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get  ready.

Giorgio: You just need to go home, take a shower, a nd throw on some clothes. How much time do you need?

Anna: You have no idea what a woman has to do to lo ok her best, do you? Not only do I have to bathe, I need to exfoliate and de pilate.

 Anna: That’s shaving and waxing to you. I have to s have and wax my legs, my armpits, and bikini area.

Giorgio: Whoa! That’s way too much information. I d idn’t need to know that.

Anna: After that, I’ll need my nail clippers, nail file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.

Giorgio: I don’t even want to know what you pluck.

Anna: Just my eyebrows and my . . .

Giorgio: Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and out s of your personal grooming. Is all that really necessary?

Anna: You are going to introduce me to your brother , aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?

Giorgio: I was until I heard all that. I don’t know  if I want my brother dating a woman who’s so high-maintenance.

Anna: High-maintenance? High-maintenance?! Who are you calling high- maintenance?

Giorgio: And high-strung!

[end of dialogue]

Our scriptwriter understands all the ins and outs of the English language. I speak, of course, of the wonderful, not high-maintenance D r. Lucy Tse.



# Traveling to a Remote Island

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,082 – Traveling to a Remote Island.

This episode is a dialogue between Leandro and Alys son about going to an island far, far away. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leandro: When you said you got a plum job working a broad, I thought you were going to Europe or Asia. Where exactly is Hueller I sland?

Alysson: It’s in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. H ere, I’ll show you on the map.

Leandro: Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in suc h a far-flung place. It’s a bit remote, isn’t it?

Alysson: It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautif ul. I’ve seen photos and it looks like my idea of paradise. See? After I get settled,  you should come for a visit.

Leandro: It looks a little desolate. Is it hard to get to?

Alysson: You would need to take a 19-hour flight fr om here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.

Leandro: Aren’t you worried about living in such is olation? It’s so far from civilization.

Alysson: There are other people living on the islan d, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.

Leandro: Oh, I’m glad there’s a community living th ere. What is the population of Hueller Island?

Alysson: It’s small, which isn’t unusual for an isl and this size.

Leandro: How small?

Alysson: When I move there, it’ll increase to seven . And if you visit, you’ll make eight.

Leandro: I’ll give the idea of that trip all the co nsideration it deserves.

[end of dialogue]

Leandro begins our dialogue by saying to Alysson, “ When you said you got a plum job working abroad, I thought you were going t o Europe or Asia.” A “plum (plum) job” is a very desirable job – a good job th at perhaps pays a lot or has a lot of benefits. This expression “a plum job” is ac tually quite old in English. It goes back at least to the nineteenth century. A “plum” i s a small, sweet fruit that was considered very desirable, and so we have a “plum j ob,” meaning a very desirable job.

Leandro is asking Alysson about a plum job that she  got working abroad. The term “abroad” (abroad) means in another country – i n a “foreign country,” we could also say. Leandro thought Alysson was getting  a job in Europe or Asia. Instead, she appears to be working somewhere called  “Hueller Island.” An “island” is a piece of land surrounded by water. Le andro wants to know where Hueller Island is. Alysson says, “It’s in the middl e of the Pacific ocean. Here, I’ll show you on a map.” A “map,” of course, is a diagra m or drawing of a certain place, a geographical location.

Leandro says, “Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in such a far-flung place.” The term “far-flung” (flung) means very far away, a t a very long distance from here. We might also use the term that is used in the title of this episode, “remote” (remote). Something that is remote is very far away  from other people – very far away, often, from cities or what we might loosely c all “civilization.” It might be a place that is “isolated” – that is, it’s not next t o anything else. It is at a great distance from other places.

Leandro says it’s a very remote place – he says, “I t’s a bit remote, isn’t it?” “A bit” means a little bit, a small amount. Alysson says, “ It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautiful.” Something that is “unspoiled” is someth ing that is not spoiled. So, you

need to know the definition of “spoiled.” Something  that is spoiled is something that is ruined, something that has gone bad, someth ing that is in a very poor condition or state. So, “unspoiled” would be a plac e where very few people have gone – a place that is still, in this case, beautif ul.

Alysson says, “I’ve seen photos,” meaning photograp hs of this island, “and it looks like my idea of paradise.” “Paradise” (paradi se) is a perfect place, an ideal place. In some religions, it’s associated with the idea of heaven – a place where you go when you die (if you’re good, of course). Bu t we also use it to describe a beautiful place to visit or often to go on vacation .

Alysson says, “After I get settled, you should come  for a visit.” “To get settled” means to become comfortable in a new place or a new  position, especially if you are moving from one place to another. If you move f rom one city to another, it takes a while for you to get settled – to get every thing in the right place, to figure out where everything is in your new city, and so fo rth. Alysson is inviting Leandro to come and visit her.

Leandro says, “It looks a little desolate.” “Desola te” (desolate) means empty. It’s a negative way of describing a place that looks lik e it doesn’t have very much there. If you drive out into the middle of the dese rt outside of Los Angeles, many parts of it seem desolate. They seem as though ther e is nothing there. There is nothing interesting there, although some people lov e the desert, and so for them, it’s not desolate at all. Leandro says, “Is it,” me aning the island, “hard to get to?” “Is it hard to travel to?” is what he’s asking.

Alysson says, “You would need to take a 19-hour fli ght from here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.” We use t he term “mainland” (mainland) to describe a country that includes one or more isl ands. However, most of the land of the country is on one of the seven continen ts: North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Antarctica, and Aust ralia.

So, in the United States, for example, the mainland  consists of the parts of the United States that are part of the North American c ontinent. It does not include the islands, say, of Hawaii, or of Puerto Rico, or of Guam, or of the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. territories. The mainland, t hen, is the main part of the country that is located on one of the seven contine nts. Now, it gets a bit confusing, of course, because Australia is also an island, but you understand the general idea here.

The mainland is the main part of the country. Unles s, of course, the country is itself mostly an island. Then you wouldn’t talk abo ut the mainland, since the

entire country is an island. It’s only used when a country has both islands and a significant amount of land on one of the continents . Alysson is describing this island and is telling Leandro that he has to fly to  the mainland of whatever country this island is part of and then take a two- day boat ride – a ride in a small ship – in order to get to the island.

Leandro says, “Aren’t you worried about living in s uch isolation?” “Isolation” is when you are alone, when there is no one else aroun d you. He says, “This island is so far from civilization.” “Civilization” means society – a well-developed culture that people have, usually with some sort of establi shed government and social rules and so forth. The word “civilization” can be a tricky one to use nowadays, because traditionally it has been used to describe more industrialized, more Westernized countries and societies versus those th at were less so.

More generally, the term is used to describe a plac e where there are “services,” shall we say: electricity and water and food and st ores and houses – things that we associate with modern society. Alysson says, how ever, “There are other people living on the island, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.” The expression “another living soul ” (soul) means another person, another human being.

Leandro says, “Oh, I’m glad there is a community li ving there.” He’s glad. He’s happy that there are lots of other people there on this island as well. He then asks, “What is the population of Hueller Island?” “ Population” is the number of people living in a certain place. Alysson says, “It ’s small, which isn’t unusual for an island this size.” Leandro then asks, “How small ?” meaning exactly how many people are we talking about here.

Alysson answers, “When I move there, it’ll increase  to seven,” meaning the population will go up to seven. “And if you visit, you’ll make eight.” “You’ll make eight” here means that we will have that number of people. In other words, this island only has six people living on it. If Alysson  goes there, the population will go up to seven people, and if Leandro visits, there’ll  be eight people there. Now, normally if you visit a place we don’t count that a s part of the place’s population, but Alysson is speaking in more general terms here.

Well, Leandro clearly is not very interested in vis iting Alysson on this very small island. He says, somewhat sarcastically – somewhat jokingly – “I’ll give the idea of that trip all the consideration it deserves.” “C onsideration” means careful thought, when you think about the advantages or dis advantages, the pluses or minuses of something. Leandro is saying that really , he’s not going to think about this at all because it’s not an idea that appeals t o him, that he thinks it would be a

good one. He’s not going to visit Alysson on this v ery small island named Hueller island.

Is there a Hueller Island? Well, no. We just made t hat name up (though there are people named “Hueller”).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Leandro: When you said you got a plum job working a broad, I thought you were going to Europe or Asia. Where exactly is Hueller I sland?

Alysson: It’s in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. H ere, I’ll show you on the map.

Leandro: Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in suc h a far-flung place. It’s a bit remote, isn’t it?

Alysson: It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautif ul. I’ve seen photos and it looks like my idea of paradise. See? After I get settled,  you should come for a visit.

Leandro: It looks a little desolate. Is it hard to get to?

Alysson: You would need to take a 19-hour flight fr om here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.

Leandro: Aren’t you worried about living in such is olation? It’s so far from civilization.

Alysson: There are other people living on the islan d, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.

Leandro: Oh, I’m glad there’s a community living th ere. What is the population of Hueller Island?

Alysson: It’s small, which isn’t unusual for an isl and this size.

Leandro: How small?

Alysson: When I move there, it’ll increase to seven . And if you visit, you’ll make eight.

 Leandro: I’ll give the idea of that trip all the co nsideration it deserves.

Listening to the scripts of Dr. Lucy Tse, our scrip twriter, is a bit like being in paradise – a wonderful place. Thank you, Lucy.



# Types of Pants

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,083 – Types of Pants.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,083. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store, which has some Business and Daily English courses that I know you will love.

On this episode, we’ll listen to a dialogue between  Josh and Kayla about different kinds of pants – you know, the things you wear on y our legs. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Josh: We are going to get you out of those baggy sw eatpants and into some pants that fit.

Kayla: I don’t like pants that are too formfitting.

Josh: I’m not suggesting you buy skintight leggings , but some nice slacks would be slimming.

Kayla: I like pants with an elastic waistband. They ’re more comfortable.

Josh: Just try these khaki chinos. They’re not too tight, they’re made of a breathable fabric, and they’re comfortable.

Kayla: I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jeans.

Josh: You can’t wear jeans to your new job.

Kayla: I know, but these pants are too constricting . Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants?

Josh: That is the best example of an oxymoron I’ve ever heard.

[end of dialogue]

Josh begins our dialogue by saying to Kayla, “We are going to get you out of those baggy sweatpants and into some pants that fit .” “To get someone out of” something is to have them remove the clothing that they are wearing, and that’s what Josh is talking about when it comes to Kayla.

Kayla is wearing some “baggy sweatpants.” “Sweatpan ts” (sweatpants) are very comfortable, loose pants that are typically made wi th a soft material, a soft fabric – something like cotton. Sweatpants are often used for people who are exercising. If they don’t want to wear shorts, they  wear sweatpants. The verb “to sweat” (sweat) refers to water coming out of your b ody when you are exercising or when you get hot. A lot of people wear sweatpant s at home because they’re comfortable, and if you are in a cold climate, an a rea where the weather is somewhat cold, they are also a little warmer.

“Baggy” is an adjective we use when talking about c lothing to refer to clothing that is too big for someone, that is very large for  someone. I say “too big” – that’s probably not quite the way to describe it. It’s a p iece of clothing that is very large, that is much larger than your body, much larger tha n you would normally wear. If your pants are baggy, your pants are too big for yo u. There’s a lot of room in between your body and the material of the pants.

Josh is telling Kayla that she is going to have to take off her baggy sweatpants and get “into some pants that fit” (fit). The verb “to fit” here means it’s the proper size or the appropriate size for someone. If you say a certain shirt “fits” you, you mean the shirt is not too big – it’s not too baggy – and it’s not too small. We would say it’s “not too tight” (tight).

Kayla says, “I don’t like pants that are too formfi tting.” A piece of clothing that is “formfitting” is one that is tight up against your body. It’s not too small, but it touches your skin, typically. If you wear it, someo ne can see your form underneath the clothing. They can see the shape of your body very clearly. Kayla says she does not like “pants that are too formfitt ing.”

Josh says, “I’m not suggesting you buy skintight le ggings, but some nice slacks would be slimming.” Something that is “skintight” i s something that is similar to formfitting, but it’s even tighter. It’s very tight  against your skin. “Leggings” (leggings) are tight pants that end at the ankles, the part that connects your leg to your foot. They are often worn underneath a skirt o r a dress. They are used when the weather is cold outside, usually by women. The term “slacks” (slacks) refers to pants that are considered more formal, that you would wear to work or to some sort of professional event.

Josh is saying that he doesn’t want Kayla to buy sk intight leggings, but rather some nice slacks – a nice pair of pants that he say s would be “slimming” (slimming). Something that is “slimming” is somethi ng that makes you appear thinner than you actually are, that makes you appea r to weigh less than you actually do. The color black is often used to this effect, to have a slimming effect, so that you don’t seem quite as fat as you really a re.

Kayla says, “I like pants with an elastic waistband . They’re more comfortable.” The “waistband” (waistband) refers to the top part of a pair of pants, the part that goes around your waist. What is your “waist” (waist )? It’s the part of your body where your legs are connected to the main or torso part of your body. You can think of it as an imaginary line that goes around t he middle of your body.

Usually, when you put on a pair of pants, you pull the pants up and the pants stop right around your waist. In fact, when you buy  a pair of pants, typically the size is given in inches or centimeters, including t he size of the waist, because of course you need a pair of pants that are not too bi g and not too small for your particular body. Pants sizes are also usually given  in terms of the length of the individual “pant legs,” we would call them.

Kayla is talking about a waistband that is “elastic ” (elastic). If a fabric or a material is “elastic,” it stretches. It is “expanda ble,” we could also say. So, for example, if you have a pair of sweatpants on, usual ly the sweatpants will have an elastic band on the top so that if you are a little  skinnier or a little fatter, the pants will still fit you. This is in comparison to a pair  of slacks, a more formal pair of pants, where the waistband doesn’t stretch. It does n’t get bigger or smaller depending on your body.

Josh gives Kayla some khaki chinos to try. “Chinos”  (chinos) are pants that are not formal, but not informal. They’re sort of in be tween. Usually they have a zipper and a button on the front of them. “Khaki (k haki) chinos” are usually a light brown or tan colored pair of pants. “Khakis” became  very popular a few years ago. They’re not really formal pants. You wouldn’t wear them to a wedding or funeral probably, but they’re also not too informal , either. They’re not like a pair of sweatpants, say.

Josh says the khaki chinos are not too tight and th ey’re made of a “breathable fabric.” “Fabric” (fabric) refers to the material t hat clothing is made of. If the fabric is “breathable” (breathable), it is fabric that all ows air to pass through easily. “Cotton,” for example, is considered a breathable f abric.

Kayla says, “I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jea ns.” “Jeans” (jeans) are pants usually made from a material called “denim” (denim) , and they’re typically blue, although nowadays you can get jeans in other colors  as well. If the clothing is “broken-in” (broken-in), it has already been worn o r washed many times so that it’s more comfortable, or at least that’s one reaso n why people would buy jeans that are broken-in. They’re usually softer, because  denim can sometimes be a little uncomfortable when it is new, when it hasn’t  been worn or washed before.

We use the phrasal verb “to break in” also when we’ re talking about a pair of shoes. If someone says, “I need to break in this pa ir of shoes,” he means that he needs to wear the shoes in order to make them softe r and more comfortable. Shoes, when you first buy them, especially formal s hoes – shoes that you would wear for a formal occasion – are sometimes hard and  a little uncomfortable when you first start wearing them. So, we use the expres sion “to break-in” to refer to the process of making the shoe more comfortable by wearing it, usually a little bit every day until the shoes are broken-in.

Josh says, “You can’t wear jeans to your new job.” Jeans are considered informal pants, not the kind of thing you would wear to a jo b – not to any sort of formal event, either. Kayla says, “I know, but these pants  are too constricting.” Kayla has put on another pair of pants that Josh has reco mmended and is complaining that they’re too constricting. If pants are “constr icting” (constricting), they’re too tight, and that’s the problem Kayla is having.

She says, “Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants ?” If clothing is “dressy” (dressy), it’s something that can be used in a form al situation or for a formal occasion. When we talk about our “dress clothes,” we’re talking about clothes that would be used for a formal event. If you’re go ing to a wedding, you would want to wear your dress clothes. You would want you r clothes to be “dressy.”

Kayla’s asking if she can buy a pair of “dressy swe atpants.” And Josh says no, that is an “example of an oxymoron.” The term “oxym oron” (oxymoron) is used to describe two words that are put together that have the opposite meaning. If someone were to say, for example, “He’s a short gia nt.” Well, a “giant” (giant) is a very tall person or creature. So, you can’t have a “short giant.” That’s an oxymoron. The two words don’t go together. They hav e opposite meanings.

Sometimes people use this as a way of making a joke , using certain adjectives or adverbs next to nouns or verbs or other adjectives that don’t go together or that are opposite. If you said something was “beautifully ugly,” that would be an example of an oxymoron because “beautiful” and “ugl y” are opposites. Kayla wants to buy some sweatpants that are dressy, and t hat’s not possible because

sweatpants are “by definition,” we would say, by th eir very nature, not formal, not dressy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Josh: We are going to get you out of those baggy sw eatpants and into some pants that fit.

Kayla: I don’t like pants that are too formfitting.

Josh: I’m not suggesting you buy skintight leggings , but some nice slacks would be slimming.

Kayla: I like pants with an elastic waistband. They ’re more comfortable.

Josh: Just try these khaki chinos. They’re not too tight, they’re made of a breathable fabric, and they’re comfortable.

Kayla: I’d rather buy a pair of broken-in jeans.

Josh: You can’t wear jeans to your new job.

Kayla: I know, but these pants are too constricting . Do you think they sell dressy sweatpants?

Josh: That is the best example of an oxymoron I’ve ever heard.

# Learning a New Operating System

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,084 – Learning a New Operating System.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,084. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. When you do, you can download the Learning Guide for our cur rent episodes.

This episode is a dialogue between Vanessa and Reza  about learning a new kind of computer software. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: [gasps] What happened to my computer overn ight? This can’t be my computer.

Reza: It is. The tech guys installed a new operatin g system on all of the computers after hours.

Vanessa: But my desktop looks completely different.  Where is the menu bar? I don’t know how to open any of my applications.

Reza: You’ll have to get used to a completely diffe rent user interface. It’s been completely revamped.

Vanessa: But I had the old operating system customi zed with special settings.

Reza: Well, those settings are gone. You’ll have to  start over.

Vanessa: I don’t even know where to begin.

Reza: With this new operating system, you’re suppos ed to navigate around using those icons. They’re supposed to make multitasking easier by allowing you to minimize and maximize applications more quickly.

Vanessa: How can that be when I don’t know what any  of the icons represent?

Reza: Search me. Here’s one of the tech guys now. You can ask him all your questions.

Vanessa: I only have one.

Reza: Only one?

Vanessa: Yes. Can he restore my old operating syste m?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Vanessa surprised at somet hing. She says, “What happened to my computer overnight?” “This can’t be my computer,” she says. Reza says, “It is. The tech guys installed a new op erating system on all of the computers after hours.” So, Vanessa and Reza work f or a company. The company has people, as many companies do, who take care of the technical aspects – including the maintenance and service – of the computers.

Sometimes these people are called the “IT personnel ” – the IT workers, “IT” standing for “information technology” – but more in formally, people may refer to them simply as the “tech crew” or the “tech guys.” Notice the use of the word “guys” (guys) here. “Guys” can mean both men and wo men when you’re not really sure, although many times it’s used just to describe men. But anyway, Reza is saying that the tech guys installed, or put  in, a new operating system.

An “operating system” is the software that runs the  whole computer. The two big operating systems are the one by Apple Computer and  the one by the makers of Windows. There are of course other operating system s as well, such as Linux and a few others. Reza says that the tech guys inst alled this new operating system “after hours.” The term “after hours” refers  to the hours that come after the end of the work day. So, if the business normal ly closes at five, “after hours” would be anything after five o’clock.

Vanessa says, “But my desktop looks completely diff erent.” Your “desktop” (desktop) on your computer is the main screen that you see typically when you turn your computer on. Vanessa says, “Where’s the m enu bar?” The “menu (menu) bar (bar)” is a list of the programs that yo u have on your computer that is often found either on the bottom, the side, or the top of the computer screen. The menu bar can also refer to the specific options you  have within a given computer program.

Vanessa says, “I don’t know how to open any of my a pplications.” Your “applications” are your programs. “Applications” is  just another word for a piece of computer software. Nowadays, it’s become popular  to refer to these simply as “apps” (apps), although some people use “apps” to r efer to computer software on a phone or a tablet versus on a full-sized computer , I guess we could call it.

Reza says, “You’ll have to get used to a completely  different user interface.” The “user (user) interface (interface)” is the thing th at a person sees when he’s looking at the computer screen. Every computer prog ram has an interface. The word “interface” usually refers to something that c onnects one thing to another or the point at which two different kinds of systems c ome together.

Now of course, computer programs are written in a s pecial language that the average person doesn’t understand, and so rather th an working in that computer language, the computer operating system has ways of  making the running of the programs – the way you operate the programs – much easier for the person who is using the program. We would call that person the  “user.” So, the “user interface” is what the person using the program see s and manipulates when using a particular computer program.

Reza says that the operating system has been “compl etely revamped.” The verb “to revamp” (revamp) means to redo and revise somet hing, usually to improve it. A company might revamp its website – it might chang e its website and improve it. Usually when you revamp something, you’re making ma jor or large changes to something.

Vanessa is not happy with this new operating system . She says, “I had the old operating system customized with special settings.”  “To customize” (customize) means to design or create something so that it is p articularly useful for one person or for one sort of thing. “To customize your  computer” would be to change your computer in such a way that it works exactly t he way you want it to work. Another person might make it work a different way a nd might customize it to his or her particular preferences.

The “settings” (settings) of a computer program are  the features that are adjusted or can be changed by the individual user. So, for e xample, if you have a tablet, such as the Kindle or an iPad, you might – when you  get old like me – want to adjust the size of the letters so that the letters are bigger and are easier to read. This is one of the settings that you can change on a tablet. Settings are used in many different kinds of computer programs so that y ou can change things so that the computer program works in the way you want it t o work.

Reza says, “Well, those settings are gone. You’ll h ave to start over.” The phrasal verb “to start over” means to begin again – to do s omething from the beginning, if you will. If someone is telling you a story, and yo u don’t really understand the story and you want the person to begin at the begin ning once more, you could say to the person, “Could you start over?” Could yo u tell me the story from the beginning? Reza is telling Vanessa that she’ll have  to start over when it comes to customizing the settings of her favorite computer a pplications.

Vanessa says, “I don’t even know where to begin.” R eza says, “With this new operating system, you’re supposed to navigate aroun d using these icons.” “To navigate” (navigate) means to find a path or a way from where you are now to where you want to go. If you’re in your car, you na vigate in order to arrive at the place where you are driving to. When we’re talking about computer applications, “to navigate” refers to the process of actually usi ng the program to get done the things you want to get done.

Reza says that you’re supposed to navigate in this new operating system using these “icons.” An “icon” (icon) in a computer opera ting system is a small symbol that represents some action or, in many cases, the program that you want to use. In order to open a program, you often click on or d ouble-click on an icon in order to open the program. On your phone or tablet, you m ay use your finger and “tap” (tap) on the icon in order to open the program.

Reza continues, “They’re,” meaning the icons, “supp osed to make multitasking easier by allowing you to minimize and maximize app lications more quickly.” “To multitask” (multitask) means to do more than one th ing at a time. Many psychologists now say that true multitasking is alm ost impossible. You have to be paying attention to either one thing or the other.

Some people say that it is, in fact, very inefficie nt to multitask, but people do it anyway, especially those stupid people who drive an d try to text at the same time, or  talk on the phone while driving, which is  another thing that really bothers me because it has been found to be very dangerous. But people are stupid, and what can you do about that, right? Anyway, what was  I saying? Ah, yes, our dialogue.

Reza is talking about making things easier to “mini mize” (minimize) and “maximize” (maximize). “Minimize” and “maximize” are verb forms of the nouns “minimum” and “maximum.” “To minimize” means to mak e something smaller, as small as possible. On your computer, to minimize the program would be to make it small so that you can’t see it anymore on your s creen. “To maximize” would

mean to make the program bigger in the sense that y ou see it on your screen in a larger size.

Vanessa says, “How can that be when I don’t know wh at any of these icons represent?” When she says, “How can that be?” she’s  saying how is it possible that the icons are supposed to make it easy for me when I don’t even know what the icons represent (what the icons are supposed to  mean)?

Reza doesn’t really know either. He uses a common e xpression that we would have in informal conversation, which is “Search me. ” “Search me” is a phrase we use when you don’t have an answer for the question either. When someone says, “I don’t know how to do this. Do you?” And the person says, “Search me,” the person means that he doesn’t understand or he d oesn’t have the answer either.

Reza says, “Here’s one of the tech guys now” (one of the IT guys is obviously entering the room) “You can ask him all your questi ons.” Vanessa says, “I only have one.” Reza says, “Only one?” meaning “You only  have one question?” Vanessa says, “Yes. Can he restore my old operating  system?” “To restore” (restore) means to return something to how it was b efore. “To restore a computer application” would be to bring it back to the way i t was before you changed it, or perhaps even before you accidentally erased it.

Vanessa wants her old operating system back, and we  – which is all of us who deal with computers – know that sometimes new opera ting systems can be somewhat confusing because things are done differen tly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa: [gasps] What happened to my computer overn ight? This can’t be my computer.

Reza: It is. The tech guys installed a new operatin g system on all of the computers after hours.

Vanessa: But my desktop looks completely different.  Where is the menu bar? I don’t know how to open any of my applications.

Reza: You’ll have to get used to a completely diffe rent user interface. It’s been completely revamped.

# Having Good and Bad Luck

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,085 – Having Good and Bad Luck.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,085. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Special Courses in Business and Daily English. You can also  take a look at our ESL Podcast Blog, and why not like us on Facebook at fa cebook.com/eslpod? Oh yeah, sure, we’re also on Twitter @eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue between Cesar and Olga a bout luck, chance, fate. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar: I can’t catch a break. Everything seems to b e going wrong these days.

Olga: Maybe your streak of bad luck is because you did something unlucky.

Cesar: What do you mean?

Olga: Have you walked under a ladder or crossed pat hs with a black cat lately?

Cesar: I don’t think so, but I’m not superstitious.  I don’t believe breaking a mirror will bring me seven years of bad luck.

Olga: Say what you will, but it doesn’t hurt to tak e some precautions, especially the way things have been going for you.

Cesar: I don’t know . . .

Olga: Here, you can borrow my rabbit’s foot and my four-leaf clover. I’ll go home to get you a horseshoe so you can hang it upside do wn over your front door.

Cesar: I really doubt any of that is going to do me  any good.

Olga: You know what tomorrow is, don’t you?

Cesar: The thirteenth?

Olga: Friday the thirteenth. Do you really want to take your chances?

Cesar: I guess not. Do you really think these good luck charms will help?

Olga: We’ll know on the fourteenth, won’t we?

[end of dialogue]

Cesar says to Olga, “I can’t catch a break.” The ex pression “to catch (catch) a break (break)” means to be lucky, to experience luc k when you have been experiencing a lot of problems or bad luck. “Luck” (luck) is the idea that we can have things happen to us even though we don’t do an ything about them. We don’t cause them in any way, but somehow the world is arranged so that things will happen to you or not happen to you due to chan ce. So, “to catch a break” would be to have something good happen to you – to have good luck.

Cesar says, “Everything seems to be going wrong the se days.” “To be going wrong” means to be having a lot of problems, to hav e things result in ways that you don’t want them to. Olga says, “Maybe your stre ak of bad luck is because you did something unlucky.” A “streak” (streak) is when things happen one after the other – the same thing keeps repeating itself.

This can be a good thing. For example, if you’re a baseball player and you hit the ball every time you get up and it’s your turn to hi t the ball, and you do that 10 times in a row or 20 times in a row, we would call that a “streak” – something is happening over and over again. Now, it could be a g ood thing or it could be a bad thing. People talk about a “streak of good luck ” or a “streak of bad luck.” That would refer to things that are happening to you ove r and over again.

Well, in the case of Cesar, he appears to be having  a streak of bad luck – when bad things are happening to him over and over again . Now, “luck” by definition is something that happens by chance – at random, if yo u will. But Olga doesn’t think that Cesar’s streak of bad luck is at random.  She says, “Maybe this is happening to you because you did something unlucky. ” Cesar says, “What do you mean?”

Olga says, “Have you walked under a ladder or cross ed paths with a black cat lately?” Olga is now starting to talk about the bel ief that some people have that good luck or bad luck isn’t really random. In fact,  it’s something that you cause by

doing something wrong. In this case, Olga refers to  two common, what we would call “superstitions,” at least here in the United S tates.

A “superstition” (superstition) is a belief in some thing that cannot be explained by the laws of nature, if you will. Something that see ms extraordinary. Superstitions usually revolve around or involve people believing that if they do one thing, then somehow, magically, something else will happen to t hem. It’s almost like a guarantee, like you’re able to control things in wa ys that we wouldn’t normally expect you to be able to.

Well, two popular superstitions that are held by so me people in the United States are that if you walk under a ladder or if you see a  black cat, you will have bad luck. A “ladder” (ladder) is something you use to c limb up to the top of something. It’s like a set of stairs, but it goes straight up.  You use a ladder, for example, to get to the top of your house to paint it. Some peop le believe if you walk underneath a ladder – that is, right under the ladd er as it is put up against the side of a house or building – you will have bad luc k.

Other people believe – more logically, I think – th at if you cross paths with a black cat, you will also have bad luck. “To cross ( cross) paths (paths)” with someone means to see someone by chance, without pla nning to meet them. Often we use this expression “to cross paths with” when you have a disagreement or an argument with that person. Here it’s used just to mean to accidentally or by chance see someone.

So if you see a black cat, many people believe you will have bad luck. Now, of course, cats are bad luck in my opinion, and so thi s superstition sort of makes sense. (You should try to stay away from cats, is w hat I’m saying.)

Now Cesar says, “I don’t think so, but I’m not supe rstitious” – I don’t believe in these superstitions. “I don’t believe breaking a mi rror will bring me seven years of bad luck.” Cesar mentions another popular superstit ion, which is that if you break a mirror – something you use to see your reflection  in – you will not only have bad luck, you will have seven years of bad luck. I’ m not sure where that superstition came from or why people believe it wil l bring seven years versus, I don’t know, 20 years, but that’s the superstition.

Olga says, “Say what you will, but it doesn’t hurt to take some precautions.” The phrase “say what you will” is used sometimes when y ou are disagreeing with what another person has said and you want to give y our opinion again. You want to restate your opinion. Olga knows that Cesar disa grees with her, but she is going to continue with her belief and continue expr essing this opinion.

 She says, “It doesn’t hurt to take some precautions .” A “precaution” (precaution) is something you do to prevent getting hurt or harm ed in the future. A precaution against having your house robbed is to lock the doo rs at night. That’s a precaution. It’s a “safety measure,” we might also call it – something you do to keep safe, to prevent yourself from being harmed. C esar is doubtful of the advice Olga is giving him. He says, “I don’t know.”

But Olga continues on. She says, “You can borrow my  rabbit’s foot and my four- leaf clover. I’ll go home to get you a horseshoe so  you can hang it upside down over your front door.” Olga now mentions three supe rstitions that are related to good luck; one of them is to have a “rabbit’s (rabb it’s) foot (foot).” A rabbit’s foot is just what it sounds like. It’s the cut-off foot of a rabbit. Some people believe that this will give you good luck.

I actually had a rabbit’s foot when I was younger. I’m not sure where I got it. I didn’t kill the rabbit to get it, I can tell you th at much. Someone did, though. A “four-leaf clover” (clover) is a small plant that h as four leaves instead of three. There is a belief that if you have one that has fou r leaves, you will have good luck.

A “horseshoe” (horseshoe) is just what it sounds li ke. It’s a shoe, a piece of metal that is put on the foot – or more accurately, the “ hoof” (hoof) – of a horse. Horseshoes are used on the feet, or hooves, of hors es to protect the horses’ hooves, but some people believe that if you take a horseshoe and you hang it on your wall upside down so that it looks like a “U,” you will have good luck.

Cesar says, “I really doubt any of that is going to  do me any good.” Olga says, “You know what tomorrow is don’t you?” Cesar says, “The thirteenth?” meaning the date tomorrow is the thirteenth of the month. O lga says, “Friday the thirteenth.” There’s another common superstition th at when the thirteenth is a Friday, that day is particularly bad luck. There we re also a series of movies made, horror movies, called Friday the Thirteenth . Those were particularly bad movies in addition, perhaps, to being bad luck.

Olga says, “Do you really want to take your chances ?” The expression “to take your chances” means to take a risk, to do something  that may harm you or hurt you. Cesar says, “I guess not. Do you really think these good luck charms will help?” A “good luck charm” (charm) is some small it em that according to superstition is supposed to bring you good luck. the horseshoe, the rabbit’s foot – these are two examples of good luck charms.

Cesar is asking Olga if she really thinks that thes e good luck charms will help Cesar with his bad luck. Olga says, “We’ll know on the fourteenth, won’t we?” meaning since tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth, we ’ll know the next day – Saturday the fourteenth – if these good luck charms  helped you or not. My guess is they probably won’t.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar: I can’t catch a break. Everything seems to b e going wrong these days.

Olga: Maybe your streak of bad luck is because you did something unlucky.

Cesar: What do you mean?

Olga: Have you walked under a ladder or crossed pat hs with a black cat lately?

Cesar: I don’t think so, but I’m not superstitious.  I don’t believe breaking a mirror will bring me seven years of bad luck.

Olga: Say what you will, but it doesn’t hurt to tak e some precautions, especially the way things have been going for you.

Cesar: I don’t know . . .

Olga: Here, you can borrow my rabbit’s foot and my four-leaf clover. I’ll go home to get you a horseshoe so you can hang it upside do wn over your front door.

Cesar: I really doubt any of that is going to do me  any good.

Olga: You know what tomorrow is, don’t you?

Cesar: The thirteenth?

Olga: Friday the thirteenth. Do you really want to take your chances?

Cesar: I guess not. Do you really think these good luck charms will help?

Olga: We’ll know on the fourteenth, won’t we?

[start of dialogue]

Camille: No, you can’t have a new bike if you get a n A on the test. You should study because you want to do well in school. We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight. Kids!

Aaron: What’s the matter?

Camille: My kids won’t do anything without an incen tive. I know it’s my own fault for offering rewards for good behavior, but now all  they want to know is what they’ll get to do what I ask.

Aaron: Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they?

Camille: That’s the problem. I feel like I have to bribe them to do the simplest things. I get home from work and I’m tired and fraz zled. I don’t want another power struggle, so I rely on bribes. It’s backfired .

Aaron: How do you mean?

Camille: Now my kids won’t do anything without know ing what’s in it for them. And they keep upping the ante. Soon I’ll have to st art forking over cash to get them to behave.

Aaron: I don’t know what to say. When I was growing  up, my mother put the fear of God into us. We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear  of making her angry. We never got rewards for good behavior. It was just ex pected of us.

Camille: What’s your mother’s number? Is she availa ble to babysit?

Aaron: Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think she could in spire that kind of obedience from other people’s children.

Camille: I’m desperate! At the very least, she can give me a few parenting lessons.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Camille saying, “No, you c an’t have a new bike if you get an A on the test.” Camille is talking to her so n or daughter, we guess. The child has asked his mother if he could get “a new b ike” – a new bicycle – if he gets an A on his test. An A is the highest score th at you can get on a test or an examination or a school assignment. Camille says to  her child, “You should study because you want to do well in school.” In other wo rds, you shouldn’t study just to get a reward, a prize. You should study because you want to be successful in school.

Camille says, “We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight.” Next we hear from Aaron, who appears to be with Camille – another adu lt who has been listening to Camille talk to her child. Aaron says, “What’s the matter?” meaning “What’s wrong?” What’s the problem? Camille says, “My kids”  – my children – “won’t do anything without an incentive.” An “incentive” (inc entive) is something that motivates you to do something, something that makes  you want to do something else. For some people, an incentive might be money.  They might work harder in order to get more money. The money is an incentive.

Camille says, “I know it’s my fault for offering re wards for good behavior, but now all they want to know is what they’ll get to do wha t I ask.” Camille is saying that it’s her “own fault,” meaning the blame is on her. She is responsible for this situation. The situation is that her children won’t  do anything without a “reward” (reward). A reward is something you give to someone  – sometimes to thank him or her for doing something for you, sometimes becau se the person has done something that you think is good and you want to en courage them to do it even more.

Camille has been giving her children rewards for go od behavior. “Good behavior” is when someone acts nice, is polite, does what he or she is told. It’s a term we often use in describing the way children act. Aaron  says, “Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they?” “To use somet hing sparingly” (sparingly) means to use it not very often. If you use, say, sa lt sparingly on your food, you’re only going to put a little bit of salt, not very mu ch, on your food.

Camille says, “That’s the problem. I feel like I ha ve to bribe them to do the simplest things.” “To bribe” (bribe) means to give someone money to do something that he or she should do anyway. So, for example, if you need to get something from the government, some government offi cials – some people who work for the government – might ask you for some ex tra money to do what they should do anyway. That would be an example of havin g to bribe someone to do something. Camille feels like she has to bribe her children “to do the simplest things.”

She says, “I get home from work and I’m tired and f razzled.” “To be frazzled” (frazzled) means to be very tired, to be worn out, to not be able to think clearly about something. Camille says, “I don’t want anothe r power struggle, so I rely on bribes.” A “struggle” (struggle) is a conflict, a f ight. A “power struggle” is when you have two people who are trying to control a sit uation, two people who are trying to show that they have the power or the auth ority to control a certain situation.

Sometimes parents and children have a power struggl e. The child wants to get what he wants, the parent wants to get what he or s he wants, and that results in problems. Camille relies on bribes. She depends on bribes to get her children to do what she wants. However, she says, “It’s backfir ed” (backfired). “To backfire” means to have the opposite effect to what you wante d or planned – to do the opposite of what you think is supposed to happen.

So, for example, you may want your child to go to b ed at eight o’clock at night. So, you tell the child, “You go to bed right now,” but instead, the child starts crying and crying and complaining, and eventually y ou let the child stay up for another hour. Your plan “backfired.” Instead of get ting the child to go to bed eight o’clock, the child stayed up for another hour.

By the way, my mother tells me that I was never lik e this as a child. I was, I think her words were, “a perfect child” – an “angel,” she  once told me. Well, I think that’s what she said. Anyway, Aaron says, “How do y ou mean?” “How do you mean?” is a question we use when we don’t understan d exactly what the person is saying – when we want the person to give us more  information or more details.

 Camille says, “Now my kids won’t do anything withou t knowing what’s in it for them.” The expression “what’s in it for them” (or “ for me”) means the advantage or the benefit that someone will receive because th ey do something. Someone may say to you, “I want you to go to the store and buy me a watch,” and you may be wondering, “Well, why would I do that?” So, you might say to the person, “Well, what’s in it for me?” In other words, what b enefits do I get? That’s what Camille’s children tell her.

Camille says, “And they,” her children, “keep uppin g the ante.” “To up the ante” (ante) is a betting expression. It’s the amount of money that you bet, say, in poker or in other games before the game begins or a t the beginning of the game. “To up the ante” means to increase it. Here it mean s to increase the risks or increase the rewards for some action. Camille says,  “Soon, I’ll have to start forking over cash to get them to behave.” “To fork (fork) over” some amount of money means to give someone a large amount of money  even if you don’t want to.

Camille is saying that she has to give her children  money, or she fears she will have to give her children money, to get them to beh ave. Aaron says, “I don’t know what to say. When I was growing up, my mother put the fear of God into us.” This expression “to put the fear (fear) of God ” into someone or in someone means to frighten someone, to make someone scared s o that the person will do what you want him or her to do. That was certainly true with my father.

Aaron says, “We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear of  making her angry.” “Dare” (dare) means to do something that is very difficult  or challenging – that is not “socially acceptable,” we might say. If you say you  wouldn’t dare do something, you mean that you wouldn’t do it under any circumst ances. In this case, Aaron is talking about not daring to misbehave, to act badly , for fear of making his mother angry. The expression “for fear of” means because o ne is afraid of.

Aaron says, “We never got rewards for good behavior . It was just expected of us.” Camille then asks Aaron, “What’s your mother’s  number,” meaning her telephone number. “Is she available to babysit?” “T o babysit” (babysit) means to take care of someone else’s child, usually for mone y. Aaron says, “Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think she could inspire that kind of obedience from other people’s children.”

Aaron is saying that his mother probably can’t help  Camille because she probably could not “inspire that kind of obedience. ” “To inspire” (inspire) means to create a certain feeling, want, or desire in ano ther person. Aaron is saying he

doesn’t think his mother would be able to make Cami lle’s children obedient. “Obedient” comes from the word “obedience” (obedien ce), which means an agreement to do what someone tells you to do – to f ollow someone else’s orders.

Camille says, “I’m desperate!” (desperate). “To be desperate” means to want something very badly, thinking that you don’t have any other choices, any other options. Camille says, “At the very least, she can give me a few parenting lessons.” Camille is asking to speak with Aaron’s m other so that “at the very least,” meaning at minimum, Aaron’s mother can give  her some parenting lessons. “Parenting” (parenting) refers to the act of bringing up or raising children, how you treat your children, what sort of  things you say and do with your children. That is part of parenting.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Camille: No, you can’t have a new bike if you get a n A on the test. You should study because you want to do well in school. We’ll talk about it when I get home tonight. Kids!

Aaron: What’s the matter?

Camille: My kids won’t do anything without an incen tive. I know it’s my own fault for offering rewards for good behavior, but now all  they want to know is what they’ll get to do what I ask.

Aaron: Rewards are okay if you use them sparingly, aren’t they?

Camille: That’s the problem. I feel like I have to bribe them to do the simplest things. I get home from work and I’m tired and fraz zled. I don’t want another power struggle, so I rely on bribes. It’s backfired .

Aaron: How do you mean?

Camille: Now my kids won’t do anything without know ing what’s in it for them. And they keep upping the ante. Soon I’ll have to st art forking over cash to get them to behave.

Aaron: I don’t know what to say. When I was growing  up, my mother put the fear of God into us. We wouldn’t dare misbehave for fear  of making her angry. We never got rewards for good behavior. It was just ex pected of us.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Otto and Jean about putting something up in your windows to block out t he light or simply to decorate. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

[doorbell rings]

Otto: Hi, I’m Otto from Windows-R-Us. I’m here to s how you the window treatment options we offer and to take measurements  for installation if you decide to order from our store.

Jean: Hi, Otto. I’m Jean. Come on in. I want to get  some new window treatments for the living room. Can you show me what you have?

Otto: Sure. For the living room, I would recommend these beautiful wooden shutters. Opening the slats allows light to filter in and closing them blocks light and gives you privacy.

Jean: They’re nice, but I think they may be a littl e too expensive for me.

Otto: In that case, you might like blinds, mini bli nds, or vertical blinds. They have the same function as shutters at a fraction of the price.

Jean: Those are still a little bit pricey. Are ther e any other options?

Otto: Well, you could go with curtains. You can cho ose the type of curtain rods that match your décor and any kind of fabric. With a valance, they would look very nice.

Jean: Nice fabric could cost a lot of money. Any ot her suggestions?

Otto: Do you have a bedsheet?

Jean: Yes.

Otto: Nail it over your window and call it a day. H ave a nice day, ma’am.

[door slams]

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Otto saying, “Hi, I’m Otto  from Windows-R-Us.” “Windows-R-Us” is, I guess, the name of the company , a company that probably sells windows or things related to windows – and th at’s exactly what Otto is going to talk about here. He says, “I’m here to show you the window treatment options we offer.” “Window treatments” are the kinds of thi ngs that you cover a window with, either because you don’t want people to see i nside of your house or for decoration, because it looks nice.

Otto says that he’s there talking to Jean to show h er the window treatment options that his company offers, that his company s ells. He’s also there at her house “to take measurements for installation” if Je an decides to order from his store. “Measurements” (measurements) are numbers sh owing the height, the width, and sometimes the depth of something. Measur ements refer to how big something is. “It’s 10 inches by 20 inches.” That w ould be a measurement, say, of a window – a really, really, really small window . “Installation” (installation) is the act of putting something in place, of setting s omething up, of in this case putting something on the windows.

Jean says, “Hi, Otto. I’m Jean. Come on in,” meanin g come into the house. Our dialogue began with the doorbell ringing, so we kno w that Otto was outside of the house, and Jean opens the door for him and lets him  in. Jean then says, “I want to get some new window treatments for the living ro om. Can you show me what you have?” Otto says, “Sure. For the living room, I  would recommend these beautiful wooden shutters.” “Shutters” (shutters) a re a kind of window treatment that is fixed onto the frame of the window, typical ly, and usually made of wood.

You can have shutters that are vertical – that run from top to bottom – that you open up just like a door in front of your window. You can also have shutters that are horizontal – that go from side to side – that a re again permanently attached or affixed to the frame of the window. The “frame” (frame) is the part inside of the house that holds the windows in place. Typically wi ndows, of course, are made of glass that you can see through.

If the shutters are horizontal, usually they are ma de of long, flat pieces of wood or some other material that are placed one below the other so that you have a set of these long, narrow pieces of wood. These lon g, narrow pieces are called “slats” (slats). The slats then are opened or close d, usually with a long stick or long piece of wood that is attached to all of the s lats so you can open the slats to let light in or close them to keep light out. That’ s why Otto says, “Opening the slats allows light to filter in.” “To filter (filte r) in” means to come in, but not completely.

If you have shutters on your windows, not all of the light will come into the room, only the amount of light that can come in when the slats are open. Closing the slats “blocks light.” “To block” (block) means to s top or prevent something from going from one place to another. In this case, it b locks the light from coming into the room when you have the shutters closed. This al so gives you “privacy” – it means that people can’t see into your house.

Jean says, “They’re nice, but I think they may be a  little expensive for me.” Otto says, “In that case, you might like blinds, mini bl inds, or vertical blinds.” “Blinds” (blinds) are similar to shutters, but usually they’ re made of metal or plastic and are attached together not with a piece of wood – us ually with a string or cord. Blinds are also not fixed permanently to the frame of the window, so that you can usually roll the blinds up, meaning you can remove the window treatment – the blinds – so that it’s at the very top or bottom or side of the window.

With shutters, the slats are usually permanent. You  can’t move them up or down completely. You can only open and close them. With blinds, you’re able to not only open and close the slats to let light in or to  block light from coming in, but to move the blinds to the top or to the bottom, typica lly. Now, if you have blinds where the slats are horizontal, we usually call tho se “venetian blinds,” like the city of Venice in Italy.

You can also have what are called “vertical blinds. ” Those are blinds, often used for large windows or doors, that go from top to bot tom instead of from side to side, and like horizontal or venetian blinds, you can also open and close the slats or push them to expose the entire window or door. “ Mini blinds” are the same as

blinds, except the slats are smaller and usually na rrower than you would see in regular blinds.

Otto tells Jean that the blinds have the same funct ion – that is, they do the same things – as shutters at a fraction of the price. “A t a fraction (fraction) of the price” means at a much lower price, much less expensive. B ut Jean says, “Those are still a bit pricey.” If you describe something as “ pricey” (pricey), you mean it is expensive. It costs more than what you want to pay,  perhaps. Jean says, “Are there any other options?”

Otto says, ‘Well, you could go with curtains.” “Cur tains” (curtains) are large pieces of fabric, large pieces of cloth that are hu ng from the top of the window and extend all the way to the bottom of the window,  typically. Sometimes there will be two sets of curtains, one on the top of the  window and one on the bottom of the window. Sometimes there’ll be one long curta in that covers the entire window. Usually curtains can be opened or closed, j ust like blinds.

Otto says, “You can choose the type of curtain rods  that match your décor and any kind of fabric.” A “curtain rod” (rod) is a lon g pole or stick that goes at the top of the window on which you hang the curtain. The cu rtain rods can match your décor. “Décor” (décor) means the look of a room, the way it is decorated, the way it is furnished. The style, the color, the type of material in the room are all part of the décor of a room.

Otto says the curtains can be made of any “fabric” (fabric). “Fabric” is the same as cloth – large pieces of material, in this case t hat are used to make curtains. You can also make clothing out of fabric. Otto says , “With a valance, they would look very nice.” A “valance” (valance) is a short p iece of fabric that is put over the top part of the window to hide the curtain rod so y ou don’t actually see it.

Jean says, “Nice fabric could cost a lot of money. Any other suggestions?” Jean doesn’t seem to want to pay very much for her windo w treatments, so Otto – I think making a joke – says, “Do you have a bedsheet ?” A “bedsheet” is a large piece of fabric that you put on top of your bed. Je an says, “Yes.” Otto says, “Nail it over your window and call it a day.” A “nail” (n ail) is a short round piece of metal that you use in combination with a hammer in order to put two things together. The verb is “to nail.”

Otto is jokingly suggesting to Jean that she just t ake an old bedsheet and put it over the window and “call it a day.” The expression  “to call it a day” means to stop working on something for the rest of the day, especially if you are very tired

of working on it. Even if you haven’t finished, you  will stop working on it. That’s the meaning of “to call it a day.” Otto is joking, but he’s also angry. He says, “Have  a nice day, ma’am.” And then he closes the door very loudly. Of course, he’s fru strated with Jean because Jean seems to think that all of these options are t oo expensive.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

[doorbell rings]

Otto: Hi, I’m Otto from Windows-R-Us. I’m here to s how you the window treatment options we offer and to take measurements  for installation if you decide to order from our store.

# Selling a Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,088 – Selling a Business.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,088. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast Store with additional courses in Business and Daily English – courses you can download immediately, right in the comfort of your own home.

In this episode, we have a dialogue between Andy an d Robin about selling a business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: I can’t believe you’re really selling up. I t hought you’d stick it out for another year.

Robin: Business has been slow for three years runni ng and I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon. I’m selling this bu siness now before it’s completely worthless.

Andy: You should get a good price with all that equ ipment and inventory.

Robin: I’m hoping that my valuation is in line with  what buyers want to pay. I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my consulting servic es as part of the deal. I’ll introduce the new owners to my suppliers and client s, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operations.

Andy: That should give them a jump-start. With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope that business is better there.

Robin: I couldn’t do that. The sales contract has a  non-compete clause. That’s only fair.

Andy: I guess. What are you going to do now?

Robin: I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of the s ale, I might try my hand at something entirely different.

Andy: How different?

Robin: I’ve always wanted to own an ice cream shop.

Andy: An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want t o rethink that business plan.

[end of dialogue]

Andy begins our dialogue by saying to Robin, “I can ’t believe you’re really selling up.” “To sell up” is a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to sell most of what you own with the plan of moving to another city or another place. Usually we use this phrasal verb in talking about a business that is se lling its assets – what it owns – in order to move to a new place or perhaps simply t o go out of business.

Andy says, “I thought you’d stick it out for anothe r year.” The expression “to stick (stick) it out (out)” means to continue doing somet hing even though it is very difficult, even though there are a lot of challenge s and problems. “To stick it out” means to persist to continue working on something o r doing something, even when it is difficult.

Robin says, “Business has been slow for three years  running.” When we say “business has been slow,” we mean that we haven’t b een making very much money. The business is not doing very well. Now, od dly enough, if the business is doing well, we don’t say, “Business has been run ning fast.” We only say, “Business has been running slow,” if the business h as been unsuccessful. If a business is successful, we’d probably say something  like, “It’s been going great.”

Robin says that “business has been slow for three y ears running,” meaning three years in a row – consecutively, one after the other . She says, “I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon.” “To count on” some thing means to depend on something, to rely on something. “To pick up” here as a phrasal verb means to increase in speed or pace. In this case, it means t o be making more money. If business is picking up, you’re getting more busines s.

Robin says, “I’m selling this business now before i t’s completely worthless.” If something is “worthless” (worthless), it means it h as no value. It is not worth any money. Andy says, “You should get a good price with  all that equipment and inventory.” Andy says Robin should get a good price , meaning that she’ll get a lot

of money for her business. She has “equipment and i nventory” (inventory). “Inventory” refers to all of the things – the goods , the products – that a company has made or owns but hasn’t sold yet.

So if you sell, I don’t know, T-shirts, and you hav e a hundred T-shirts in your house that you are selling – let’s say online – you r inventory of T-shirts is 100. You have 100 T-shirts in your inventory. Usually we  use the word “inventory” only for physical products, not for services or digital products like downloads, for example.

Robin says, “I’m hoping that my valuation is in lin e with what buyers want to pay.” The “valuation” (valuation) of something is how muc h something is worth. If you are going to sell your business, usually you have t o have someone evaluate it, tell you how much it is worth. That would give you a “valuation.”

The expression “in line (line) with” means similar to or in accordance with – not significantly different than. It’s used when we’re comparing two different concepts. In this case, we’re comparing the valuati on – what Robin thinks or what an expert thinks her business is worth – and w hat buyers want to pay for the business. We want the valuation to be “in line with,” or at about the same amount as, what buyers want to pay.

She says, “I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my  consulting services as part of the deal.” “To sweeten (sweeten) the pot (pot)” mea ns to make something more attractive to buyers, especially by adding somethin g free. So, for example, when you go to buy a new car, the salesman or saleswoman  might say, “Well, if you buy the car today, I’ll give you the air-conditioni ng system for free,” or “I’ll give you a new CD player.” The salesperson is trying to sweeten the pot – trying to make the deal more enticing, more interesting to yo u so that you will go ahead and buy it.

Robin wants to sweeten the pot in selling her busin ess by offering her consulting services. “Consulting” (consulting) here means givi ng advice, giving help to someone, especially another business. When you have  a “consultant” – a person who consults – that person gives you help or advice  with your business. Robin says, “I’ll introduce the new owners to my supplier s and clients, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operati ons.” A business’s “suppliers” (suppliers) are the companies and people that the b usiness buys things from.

So, if you’re a restaurant, your suppliers would in clude people who sell you food that you then prepare to sell in your restaurant. “ To go over the books” (books) means to review the accounting records and financia l statements for a business.

“The books” refers to the accounting system or acco unting information that used to be kept in a single book. Nowadays, of course, i t’s in a computer program for most businesses. Robin is going to introduce the ne w owners to her suppliers and clients – that is, customers – go over the book s with them, and help them set up or establish daily operations.

Andy says, “That should give them a jump-start.” A “jump-start” is an early beginning, an opportunity to start something more q uickly than you might otherwise be able to do. Andy says, “With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope tha t business is better there.” But Robin says, “I couldn’t do that,” meaning she c ouldn’t start up a similar business in another part of the same city.

She says, “The sales contract,” the agreement to se ll the business, “has a non- compete clause.” A “clause” (clause) in a contract is a section or part of a contract or agreement. “To compete” (compete) means  to go up against someone for the same clients or the same customers.  If you have a “non- compete clause,” that’s an agreement where you say you will not start a similar business or try to take business away from the pers on you are selling your business to.

So, if I own a donut shop, and I sell the donut sho p to someone with a non- compete clause in the contract, I am agreeing not t o open up another donut shop a mile away that would then take business away from  the original donut shop. (That’s making me hungry, talking about donuts, fra nkly.) Robin says, “That’s only fair,” meaning that would be the fair and just  way to do it. Andy says, “I guess,” meaning okay, I agree. “What are you going to do now?”

Robin says, “I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of  the sale, I might try my hand at something entirely different.” The “proceeds (pr oceeds) of a sale” are the profits, the money that you get from selling someth ing. If you sell your car for a thousand dollars, the proceeds of the sale are a th ousand dollars. “To try your hand (hand) at” something means to attempt to do so mething for the first time, not knowing whether you will be successful or not. If you have never played tennis and you say, “I’m going to try my hand at te nnis,” you mean you are going to play tennis for the first time.

Robin wants to try her hand at something entirely o r completely different. Andy says, “How different?” Robin says, “I’ve always wan ted to own an ice cream shop” – that is, a store that sells ice cream. Andy  says, “An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want to rethink that business pla n.”

So, we learn that Robin is going to be living in Al aska, which of course is a very cold state in the United States. And it’s not a pla ce where you would expect a lot of people to be wanting to buy ice cream, since ice  cream is usually more popular in hot places. That’s why Andy says he thin ks that Robin should “rethink,” or think about again, her business plan.  Your “business plan” is your written document including the plans that you have for starting a new business or opening a new business.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: I can’t believe you’re really selling up. I t hought you’d stick it out for another year.

Robin: Business has been slow for three years runni ng and I can’t count on things to pick up anytime soon. I’m selling this bu siness now before it’s completely worthless.

Andy: You should get a good price with all that equ ipment and inventory.

Robin: I’m hoping that my valuation is in line with  what buyers want to pay. I plan to sweeten the pot by offering my consulting servic es as part of the deal. I’ll introduce the new owners to my suppliers and client s, go over the books with them, and help them set up daily operations.

Andy: That should give them a jump-start. With all that knowledge, you could start a new business on the other side of town and hope that business is better there.

Robin: I couldn’t do that. The sales contract has a  non-compete clause. That’s only fair.

Andy: I guess. What are you going to do now?

Robin: I’m not sure yet. With the proceeds of the s ale, I might try my hand at something entirely different.

Andy: How different?

Robin: I’ve always wanted to own an ice cream shop.

 Andy: An ice cream shop in Alaska? You might want t o rethink that business plan.

# Unconventional Marriages

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,089 – Unconventional Marriages.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,089. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode that con tains a complete transcript of everything we say on the episode. This episode is a  dialogue between Karam and Raphaela about unconventional marriages. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Karam: You and Daniel have been dating for over a y ear. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?

Raphaela: I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believ e in following conventions. We’re both open to an unconventional relationship.

Karam: What kind of unconventional relationship?

Raphaela: Many different kinds. We’re very open-min ded.

Karam: Okay, for instance, would you guys be open t o polygamy? Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse wit h someone else.

Raphaela: Well, no, I don’t think that would be rig ht for us. The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it b ecomes, I think.

Karam: Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriag e.

Raphaela: That’s probably not something I’d want.

Karam: The only other unconventional marriages I ca n think of are arranged marriages and May-December romances. Neither of tho se applies to you and Daniel. Am I missing something?

Raphaela: Well, we’d be open to living apart. We’re  both very independent and would want to retain that independence.

 Karam: Ah, then there’s my answer. I know what kind  of unconventional marriage you’d have.

Raphaela: What?

Karam: A relationship without cohabitating? Dating.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Karam saying to Raphaela , “You and Daniel have been dating for over a year. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?” “To tie (tie) the knot” means to get married. It’s another expres sion meaning to get married. Raphaela says, “I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believe in following conventions.” The word “conventions” (conventions) refers here to standards, or the commonly accepted way of doing things.

Raphaela says, “We’re both open to an unconventiona l relationship.” “Unconventional” means not usual, or unusual. In th is case, a relationship that would not be what you would normally think between two people. Karam is not sure exactly what Raphaela means. He says, “What ki nd of unconventional relationship?” Raphaela says, “Many different kinds .” She doesn’t give him a specific answer. She does say that she and Daniel a re “open-minded.” “To be open-minded” means to be willing to consider new id eas, to be willing to accept things that are perhaps unconventional.

Karam then says, “Okay, for instance” – meaning for  example – “would you guys be open to polygamy?” “Polygamy” (polygamy) is the practice of having more than one wife or more than one husband at a time. N ow, contrary to what some people think, polygamy is not legal in any state or  territory of the United States. I have heard some people who thought that this was tr ue, but it definitely is not.

Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some peopl e who live in what are, in effect, polygamous relationships, but they are not legally married. You can only be legally married to one person at a time, at leas t here in the U.S. Why you would want to have more than one wife, for example,  I have no idea. Clearly someone who believes in that hasn’t been married be fore – but anyway, back to our story.

Karam says, “Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse with someone else.” “To be able to picture” (picture) so meone is to imagine someone in a certain situation. Karam is saying that he can not imagine that either Daniel or

Raphaela would be willing to share his or her “spou se” (spouse). Your spouse is either your husband or your wife, depending on who you are.

Raphaela says, “Well, no, I don’t think that would be right for us,” meaning she doesn’t want to be in a polygamous relationship. Sh e says, “The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it b ecomes.” Karam says, “Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriage.” “To be open to” means to be willing to consider, to be willing to try. Karam is asking if Daniel and Raphaela would be willing to try an open marriage.

An “open marriage” is a marriage, I’m told, where t he husband and wife agree that they can have sexual relationships with people  outside of the marriage and yet still remain married. Now, this is different th an someone having an “affair” (affair). When you have an affair, you have sexual relations with someone who is not your husband or wife, without the husband or wi fe knowing about it. An open relationship is when you know about it, I guess. Ra phaela says, “That’s probably not what I want.” So she doesn’t want that either. So Karam is confused. He’s trying to find out exactly what Raphaela is talking  about.

He then says, “The only other unconventional marria ges I can think of are arranged marriages and May-December romances.” An “ arranged (arranged) marriage” is a marriage where the husband and wife are chosen for each other, usually by the parents. This is still done in some societies, where the parents decide who their children will marry. I did not and  do not have an arranged marriage. My parents did not select my wife. In fac t, when they met my then girlfriend, they advised her not to marry me, but f ortunately she didn’t listen. Maybe she should have.

Karam also mentions “May-December romances.” A “May -December romance” is a romantic relationship between two people with a significant difference in age. The man may be 60, and the woman may be 25. That wo uld be definitely a “May- December romance.” That happens all the time here i n Los Angeles. The rich male movie star will marry the young actress or mod el.

Karam says, “Neither of those applies to you and Da niel,” meaning neither the arranged marriage nor the May-December romance. “To  apply to” something means to be relevant to something – to be, we might  also say, “applicable to” a certain situation. Karam says, “Am I missing someth ing?” When someone asks, “Am I missing something,” he is saying, “Is there s omething I don’t understand; is there some information I don’t have?”

Raphaela says, “Well, we’re open to living apart. W e’re both very independent and would want to retain that independence.” “To li ve apart” means to live in separate houses or separate apartments. Raphaela sa ys that she and Daniel are “both very independent” and would like to or “would  want to retain (retain) that independence.” “To retain” something is to keep it,  to continue to have it.

Karam says, “Ah, then there’s my answer.” Now he un derstands. “I know what kind of unconventional marriage you have.” And Raph aela asks him, “What?” – what kind? Karam says, “A relationship without coha bitating? Dating,” he says. “To cohabitate” (cohabitate) means to live together  in the same house with someone with whom you’re having a romantic relation ship. Most conventional or regular, normal marriages have the husband and wife  living in the same house.

Karam is saying that Raphaela is talking about a re lationship without cohabitating, which is really just another name for  dating. “Dating” (dating) usually refers to the early stages of a romantic re lationship when traditionally you didn’t live with the person with whom you are havin g this romance.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Karam: You and Daniel have been dating for over a y ear. Are you guys thinking of tying the knot?

Raphaela: I’m not sure. Neither Daniel nor I believ e in following conventions. We’re both open to an unconventional relationship.

Karam: What kind of unconventional relationship?

Raphaela: Many different kinds. We’re very open-min ded.

Karam: Okay, for instance, would you guys be open t o polygamy? Somehow I can’t picture either of you sharing your spouse wit h someone else.

Raphaela: Well, no, I don’t think that would be rig ht for us. The more people involved in a relationship, the more difficult it b ecomes, I think.

Karam: Then you wouldn’t be open to an open marriag e.

Raphaela: That’s probably not something I’d want.

Raphaela: Well, we’d be open to living apart. We’re  both very independent and would want to retain that independence.

Karam: Ah, then there’s my answer. I know what kind  of unconventional marriage you’d have.

Raphaela: What?

Karam: A relationship without cohabitating? Dating.

# Speaking About the Future

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1090 – Speaking about the Future.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,090. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode. This ep isode is a dialogue between Robert and Mara, talking about things that will hap pen in the future. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Robert: These designs are really futuristic-looking .

Mara: I’m trying to be forward-thinking and imagine  what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.

Robert: You think that the world will be filled wit h space-age gadgets like these?

Mara: That’s the natural evolution of technology for the next 100 years, I think. We will continue to develop labor-saving devices, s impler ways of doing everyday tasks, and to improve artificial intellige nce.

Robert: I’m not sure I want to live in a world that  looks like that. It seems so cold and impersonal.

Mara: That’s only because most of us have a fear of  the unknown.

Robert: That’s me in a nutshell. I’d rather return to a simpler way of life with as little innovation and technology as possible.

Mara: Like modern sanitation and transportation?

Robert: Well, I want to go back in time with some t hings, but keep my conveniences.

Mara: So you want to pick and choose? That shouldn’ t be a problem when we figure out time travel.

 [end of dialogue]

Robert begins the dialogue by saying to Mara, “Thes e designs are really futuristic-looking.” The word “futuristic” (futuris tic) comes from the word “future,” meaning something that is not present or past in ti me. There’s really only one other possibility, and that would be something that  hasn’t yet happened, or the future. So “futuristic” means very forward-looking,  very modern – something that looks like, well, something from the future, even t hough that’s not technically possible.

Mara says, “I’m trying to be forward-thinking and i magine what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.” “To be forward-thinking” means to be thinking about the future, planning for the future. Robert says, “You think that the world will be filled with space-age gadgets like these?” “Gadgets” (gadg ets) are small machines or devices or tools that do something interesting, tha t do something different, some form of technology.

“Space-age” is a term you don’t hear as much now as  you did maybe in the 1960s and ’70s. “Space-age” refers to the period of  time when man is now able to go out into outer space – the area outside of ou r own world. So, “space-age” refers really to the modern era, or the modern peri od.

Mara says, “That’s the natural evolution of technol ogy for the next 100 years, I think.” “Technology” refers to the application of s cience in finding practical solutions to things, or simply the creativity of the person who makes a certain thing. “Technology” could refer to lots of differen t things, but basically to tools or things we use to accomplish something. Nowadays whe n you say “technology,” people usually think of computer technology.

“Evolution” is the process of change over a period of time, usually a long period of time. In biology, the “theory of evolution” is a ssociated with the British scientist of the nineteenth century, Charles Darwin. But here  we’re talking not about evolution of human beings, but technological evolut ion – the changing technology.

Mara continues, “We will continue to develop labor- saving devices to find simpler ways of doing everyday tasks and to improve artific ial intelligence.” A “labor (labor) – saving device” is some tool or device or machine that saves you work. “Labor-saving” refers to the time and energy you ne ed in order to accomplish something, to do something. So for example, email i n many ways is a labor- saving device. You don’t have to go to the post off ice and mail a letter. You can

just do it from your own home, or wherever you are if you have a phone with email.

Mara says also in the future, we will continue “to improve artificial intelligence.” “Artificial intelligence” is the idea that a comput er is able to use information in order to make decisions – to act as if it were like  a human being. I won’t get into the philosophical problems with that definition or that line of thinking, but usually, in computing, we’re talking about the ability of the computer to learn certain rules and apply those rules according to the programming of the computer.

Robert says, “I’m not sure I want to live in a worl d that looks like that. It seems so cold and impersonal.” Something that is “impersonal ” (impersonal) is something that you are not close to – something or some perso n that you don’t have a lot of feelings for or emotion towards. Robert is talking about a world that is “cold and impersonal.” He means a world in which there isn’t a lot of human feeling, perhaps even human interaction. That would be certa inly “impersonal.”

Mara says, “That’s only because most of us have a f ear of the unknown.” A “fear (fear) of the unknown” is when you are afraid of or  scared of things that you don’t understand, that you don’t know about. Now, of cour se, I think most of us have a fear of the unknown. It could be good. It could be bad. But if you don’t know what it is, you at the very least might want to be a lit tle cautious.

Mara is saying that the reason Robert doesn’t like Mara’s vision of the future is that he has a fear of the unknown. This is also a c ommon way of dismissing or countering someone’s argument – by saying that they  have some serious psychological problem. This is quite common in poli tics as well as in personal relations, but back to the story. Robert says, “Tha t’s me in a nutshell.” The expression “in a nutshell” (nutshell) means in a ve ry short form, in a very brief summary. Instead of giving someone a long explanati on, you give them just the essential facts or the essential information.

I read somewhere recently that this expression actu ally comes from a comment made by the Roman author Pliny the Elder about how he had heard that there was a copy of Homer’s great poems The Iliad  and The Odyssey  that were written so small, on such a small piece of paper, that they  could all be fit inside of a nutshell. That seems impossible to me, but that’s a t least one theory about where this expression “in a nutshell” comes from. It mean s in very precise terms, in the fewest number of words possible to express an idea.

Robert says, “I’d rather return to a simpler way of  life with as little innovation and technology as possible.” A “simpler way of life” wo uld be a less complicated way

of living, with less distractions. “Innovation” (in novation) refers to inventing new things or creating new technology. The verb is “to innovate.” “Novus” (novus) is the Latin word for “new” and that’s where we get th is term, ultimately, from. Robert wants a simpler way of life with as little i nnovation as possible.

Mara says, “Like modern sanitation and transportati on?” Mara is asking Robert if he wants to live in a world where you don’t even ha ve modern transportation like cars and airplanes, or modern “sanitation” (sanitat ion). “Sanitation” refers to cleanliness. We might also use the word “hygiene” ( hygiene). That would refer to your personal cleanliness – taking showers and brus hing your teeth, having bathrooms that operate in an efficient way. This is  all part of sanitation.

Roberts says, “Well, I want to go back in time with  some things, but keep my conveniences.” “To go back in time” would be imposs ible, of course. It means to return to an earlier time, before the time in which  you are now living. “Conveniences” refers to things that make your life  easier – things like, say, Google, or a car, or the ability to download podcas ts and listen to them on your way to work. These are all modern conveniences – in  some cases, quite recent conveniences.

Mara says, “So, you want to pick and choose?” meani ng you want to pick the things or select the things that you want to keep a nd those that you don’t. She says, “That shouldn’t be a problem when we figure o ut time travel.” “Time travel” is the idea that you are able to travel either forw ard or backwards in time. This is just a theoretical ability. I’m not sure if most sc ientists think it would ever be possible, but there are some that do.

There’s a popular British television show that’s be en on for years and years called Doctor Who . Doctor Who is a time traveler. He goes back and f orth in time in his little machine. I used to watch that show wh en I was in high school back in the 1970s. It’s a British sci-fi, or science fictio n show. But Mara of course is joking. She doesn’t think that we will figure out o r be able to understand time travel, at least not soon enough to benefit Robert.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Robert: These designs are really futuristic-looking .

Mara: I’m trying to be forward-thinking and imagine  what the world will be like in 50 to 100 years.

 Robert: You think that the world will be filled wit h space-age gadgets like these?

Mara: That’s the natural evolution of technology for the next 100 years, I think. We will continue to develop labor-saving devices, s impler ways of doing everyday tasks, and to improve artificial intellige nce.

# Punishing Children

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,091 – Punishing Children.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,091. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California [singing].

This episode is a dialogue between Yuki and Al abou t what to do when your children misbehave – when they don’t do what they’r e supposed to do – and you have to punish them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yuki: What are you doing?

Al: I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking for beating up his classmate. He has to learn that there are serious consequences for his actions.

Yuki: You’re punishing him for beating someone by g iving him a beating? That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an ey e for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Al: I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging. I’m going to give him a simple spanking.

Yuki: Corporal punishment isn’t the answer. We can give him a severe punishment without resorting to violence.

Al: What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowa nce or taking away his toys? Those don’t seem severe enough to me.

Yuki: We could ground him for a month, only allowin g him to go to school.

Al: That still doesn’t seem to be enough.

Yuki: All right, we can pull out the big guns then.  We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some s ense into him. He’s scared of your mother.

Al: I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?

Yuki: If I were a 10-year-old and I had to face you r angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots!

[end of dialogue]

Yuki begins our dialogue by asking Al, “What are yo u doing?” Al says, “I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking for beatin g up his classmate.” A “spanking” (spanking) is the practice of hitting a child with your hand or some other object on the child’s behind, on the child’s rear, on their butt – the part they sit down on.

This has long been a traditional way of punishing a  child, of indicating to the child that what they did was wrong and giving them someth ing to think about if they try to do it again. I’m not arguing. I’m not saying spa nking is right or wrong. I’m not a child psychologist. I can’t answer that question, b ut I can explain what the practice is, and it’s something that parents – at l east, when I was growing up – would do to their children to discipline them, to p unish them.

Al is getting ready to give Charlie a spanking “for  beating up his classmate.” “To beat (beat) up” means to hurt someone physically in  a fight. Charlie, it seems, beat up his classmate – another one of the students  in his class at school. Yuki says, “You’re punishing him for beating someone up by giving him a beating?” “To punish” (punish), as we mentioned earlier, mean s to do something to someone to discourage them from doing it again, or simply out of a sense of philosophical justice.

Once again, we won’t go into the arguments about pu nishment. Yuki says that Al is punishing Charlie for beating someone up, for hi tting someone, by hitting Charlie. She thinks this is not very logical. In fa ct, she says, “That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an eye for an eye,  a tooth for a tooth.”

This expression, which comes from the Bible, means that you respond to someone who does something bad to you by doing some thing equally bad to him or her. “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” mi ght mean literally “If you take out my eye, I’ll take out your eye.” But in general, the term means getting back at

someone or getting even with someone by doing somet hing bad to that person who did something bad to you.

Al says, “I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging.” A “flogging” (flogging) is a very serious physical punishment wh ere someone is usually hit with a stick or a rope, often on their back, as a p unishment. There aren’t any places in the United States, at least, where you wo uld get a flogging. In fact, you’d probably be arrested by the police if you gav e your child a flogging.

Al is saying he’s  not giving Charlie a flogging. H e says instead, “I’m going to give him a simple spanking,” meaning not a serious spank ing, not seriously hurting him. But Yuki doesn’t agree. Yuki says, “Corporal p unishment isn’t the answer.” “Corporal” (corporal) refers to the body. So, “corp oral punishment” is physical punishment – punishing someone’s body by hitting th em, for example.

Yuki says, “We can give him,” meaning Charlie, “a s evere punishment without resorting to violence.” A “severe (severe) punishme nt,” is a very strong punishment, a significant or major punishment. “Res orting to” something means turning to something or choosing to do something wh en you don’t have any other options available – at least, that’s what we typica lly use it to mean. “I had to resort to violence when the person on the street st arted attacking me.” I didn’t want to hit him but I had to. I had to resort to vi olence.

What Yuki is saying is that we don’t have to resort  to violence. We have other choices. We can choose other ways of punishing litt le Charlie without hitting him. Al says, “What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowance or taking away his toys? That doesn’t seem severe enough to me.” “To w ithhold” (withhold) something means to prevent someone from having some thing, especially having something that the person expects to have.

“To withhold your love” would be not to give your l ove to someone who might be expecting your love. If the company you work for “w ithholds money” to pay your taxes, that’s money they don’t give you in order to  do something with that money. And in fact, in the United States, if you are an em ployee, the company you work for will withhold taxes from you. Al is talking her e about withholding Charlie’s “allowance” (allowance).

An “allowance” is money that is given to a child on  a regular basis, often once a week or so, sometimes in exchange for or because the child does some work around the house, sometimes simply so that the chil d has the money to buy things with. When I was growing up, there were no a llowances. In fact, even if you worked around the house – and you were expected  to work around the

house – you would not be given an allowance. I neve r heard of such a thing even for most of my friends, but it is quite popular amo ng parents nowadays.

Al thinks that withholding his allowance or taking away his toys would not be a severe enough punishment for Charlie. Yuki says, “W e could ground him for a month, only allowing him to go to school.” When a p arent “grounds” (grounds) his or her child, the parent is punishing the child by not allowing him or her to leave the house and sometimes even to leave their room ot her than to come down and eat and to use the bathroom.

Usually, however, “grounding” refers to telling a c hild that he or she cannot go out and play with his or her friends – that he or s he has to stay at home, other than of course going to school. But Al isn’t convin ced. He says, “That still doesn’t seem to be enough.” He doesn’t think that’s a suffi cient punishment to teach Charlie not to go around beating up his classmates.

Yuki says, “All right. We can pull out the big guns  then.” The expression “to pull out the big guns” (guns) means to do the most power ful forceful thing you can do – to do something or to use some instrument or tool  that is the most powerful you can possibly think of. In the case of punishing Cha rlie, Yuki says, “We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some sense into him.”

Yuki is suggesting that Charlie spend the weekend w ith his grandmother, Al’s mother, and have his grandmother “talk some sense i nto him.” “To talk some sense (sense) into” someone means to persuade someo ne to agree to something, especially someone who doesn’t seem to b e acting rationally or logically. To convince someone to change their way of thinking is to talk sense into someone.

Yuki says that Charlie is scared of Al’s mother. Al  says, “I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?” Yuki says, “If  I were a 10-year-old boy and I had to face your angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots.” “Disapproving” is when someon e is not pleased with your behavior or your performance.

Yuki is saying here that if she were a 10-year-old boy like Charlie and she had to face – that is, to be with – Al’s angry and disappr oving mother for an entire or complete weekend, she’d be “quaking in her boots.” “To quake (quake) in your boots (boots)” means to be very scared, to be very frightened. “Boots” are large pairs of shoes that go over your feet, especially w hen there is rain outside or snow outside. “To quake” here means to shake.

 So, “to quake in your boots” would be to be so scar ed that you are shaking – your whole body is shaking – and that’s the idea th at Yuki is trying to convey here: that going to Al’s mother’s house for the wee kend would make the 10-year- old Charlie rather scared and would be a very sever e punishment for him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yuki: What are you doing?

Al: I’m getting ready to give Charlie a spanking for beating up his classmate. He has to learn that there are serious consequences for his actions.

Yuki: You’re punishing him for beating someone by g iving him a beating? That doesn’t make sense. Our response shouldn’t be an ey e for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Al: I’m not going to beat him. This isn’t going to be a flogging. I’m going to give him a simple spanking.

Yuki: Corporal punishment isn’t the answer. We can give him a severe punishment without resorting to violence.

Al: What kind of punishment? Withholding his allowa nce or taking away his toys? Those don’t seem severe enough to me.

Yuki: We could ground him for a month, only allowin g him to go to school.

Al: That still doesn’t seem to be enough.

Yuki: All right, we can pull out the big guns then.  We could have him spend the weekend with your mother and ask her to talk some s ense into him. He’s scared of your mother.

Al: I’m scared of my mother. Do you think it would work?

Yuki: If I were a 10-year-old and I had to face you r angry and disapproving mother for an entire weekend, I’d be quaking in my boots!

This episode is a dialogue between Linda and Bruce about being in a business meeting and making sure you get done what you are s upposed to get done. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lynda: Could I say one more thing about that?

Bruce: I’m afraid we’re running short on time. Mayb e we could wrap up this discussion now.

Lynda: Before we leave this topic, though, I really  think we should talk about next year’s plans.

Bruce: That’s outside the scope of this meeting. We  can put it on the agenda for next time.

Lynda: But we won’t meet again for a month. We shou ld spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should co nsider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin. It would save us a lot of money.

Bruce: If we get off on a tangent, we won’t be able  to get through our discussion for today. Let’s try to get back on track and discu ss the main focus of today’s meeting, which is how to end this year without any more problems. I feel like we’re getting close to making some decisions.

Lynda: We can’t make any decisions when there are s till so many unresolved issues. Things are still up in the air because we d on’t know what will happen next year. Any decisions we make now will be moot if our  assumptions are wrong.

Bruce: I’m afraid we differ on that. I think we hav e enough information now to forge ahead. We can come to some tentative decision s and make any adjustments later. Should we take it to a vote?

Lynda: If you insist. I still think it’s premature.

Bruce: I’ll take that as a “no” vote.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Linda asking something. Sh e says, “Could I say one more thing about that?” She wants to say something at this meeting we’re at. Bruce says, however, “I’m afraid we’re running shor t on time.” “To run short on time” means to not have enough time to do something . You are saying that you don’t have very much time – that you have to stop w hatever you are doing very soon.

Bruce says, “Maybe we could wrap up this discussion  now.” “To wrap (wrap) up” something here means to finish something, to comple te something, to bring something to an end. Bruce doesn’t want to allow Li nda to make another comment. He wants to end the discussion right now. Linda says, however, “Before we leave this topic,” meaning before we sto p talking about this, “I really think we should talk about next year’s plans.”

Bruce says, however, “That’s outside the scope of t his meeting.” When we say something is “outside the scope” (scope) of somethi ng – in this case, a meeting – we are saying that it is not related to what we are  doing right now or discussing right now. It is irrelevant. It is not relevant. It  is not something we should be doing right now. Bruce says, “We can put it on the agenda  for next time.” An “agenda” (agenda) is a written plan or list of topics that y ou are going to talk about in a meeting.

Linda says, “But we won’t meet again for a month.” She’s complaining that this committee or this group won’t be meeting again for at least a month. She thinks the group should talk about her topic right now. Sh e says, “We should spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should consider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin . It would save us a lot of money.” So, Linda is making a proposal about closin g one of the company’s offices.

Bruce is not too happy, I think, about Linda’s comm ent. He says, “If we get off on a tangent, we won’t be able to get through our disc ussion for today.” “To get off

on a tangent” (tangent), or more commonly “to go of f on a tangent,” means to become distracted from your main topic or your main  purpose – to start talking about something else that isn’t really related to t he main thing you’re supposed to be talking about.

Bruce thinks that Linda’s topic is not relevant to what the group is talking about right now, that they would go off on a tangent if t hey started talking about her topic. He’s worried the group won’t get through the ir discussion for today. “To get through” something means to finish it – to accompli sh or complete it.

Bruce then says, “Let’s try to get back on track an d discuss the main focus of today’s meeting.” “To get back on track” (track) me ans to return to what you should be talking about or to return to what you sh ould be doing after you have done something that you shouldn’t have been doing. In other words, if you get distracted and you want to go back to what you are supposed to be doing, you are getting back on track. That’s what Bruce wants to do. He wants to talk about how to end this year without any more problems, not  talk about next year.

He says, “I feel like we’re getting close to making  some decisions.” Linda, however, is not giving up. She’s not quitting. She says, “We can’t make any decisions when there are still so many unresolved i ssues.” If an issue or a problem is “unresolved” (unresolved), it is not yet  finished or not yet decided. It still needs to be addressed. It still needs to be s olved or talked about. The opposite, of course, would be a “resolved” issue. A  resolved issue is something that you have decided or have made a decision on or  a determination about.

Linda says that there are too many unresolved issue s to make any decisions. She continues, “Things are still up in the air beca use we don’t know what will happen next year.” If something is “up in the air,”  it is unresolved. It is still not decided or still unknown. If someone asks you where  you’re going on vacation this year and you say, “I don’t know, my plans are still up in the air,” you’re saying that you have not yet made a decision. You don’t kn ow yet.

Linda says, “Any decisions we make now will be moot  if our assumptions are wrong.” To say something is or will be “moot” (moot ) means that it is debatable or it is too uncertain to be resolved or perhaps reall y to make any difference at all. To say something is, for example, a “moot point,” i s to say that even if what you say is true, it’s not really important. It doesn’t have any real significance for what we’re talking about.

If, for example, you spend all of your time plannin g on how you’re going to spend a million dollars that you hope to win from a lotte ry, really the discussion is “moot”

unless you actually win the lottery. It doesn’t hav e any significance. It has no practical meaning or practical application. Linda i s saying that they can’t make any decisions now because “the decisions will be mo ot if our assumptions are wrong.” Your “assumptions” are your beliefs about s omething in the future or about what is true. You don’t necessarily have any evidence or proof, but you think it’s true.

We often use the verb “to make” with “assumption.” “I’m going to make some assumptions.” I’m going to think about certain situ ations and believe them to be true, or perhaps pretend that they are true in orde r to make some decision or to take some action. Linda is saying that if the assum ptions of the company are wrong, if what they think is true is not true, then  all of the decisions they make will be moot. They’ll have no importance because they’ll  have to make new decisions or make new plans in the future.

Bruce says, “I’m afraid we differ on that.” “To dif fer” (differ) means to have different beliefs or opinions about something, or s imply to be different in some way from something else. My brother and I differ on  which professional baseball team is the best in California. He thinks it’s the San Francisco Giants. I think it’s the Los Angeles Dodgers. We differ. Of course, I’m right, but I’m just giving a possible example there.

Bruce says, “I think we have enough information now  to forge ahead.” “To forge (forge) ahead” means to move forward, to continue o n. Bruce says, “We can come to some tentative decisions and make any adjus tments later.” A “tentative” (tentative) – sometimes pronounced without the seco nd “T,” as “tentative” – means to be provisional, to be temporary. In this c ase, it means not final. A tentative decision is a decision you’re making now,  but you might change it in the future.

Bruce says that they can make some tentative decisi ons now “and make any adjustments later.” An “adjustment” is a change or adaptation of something. Bruce says, “Should we take it to a vote?” meaning “Should we vote on it?” Should each person say whether they like this idea or not?

Linda says, “If you insist,” meaning if you are dem anding very strongly that we do that. “I still think it’s premature,” she says. Whe n something is “premature” (premature), it happens before it should, or it hap pens too early. When we talk about a premature birth or a premature baby, we’re talking about a baby who is born earlier than would be expected (and this, of c ourse, can sometimes lead to health complications in the baby). Linda thinks it’ s premature to make a decision.

Bruce says, “I’ll take that as a ‘no’ vote.” He mea ns that Linda is saying that she does not want to vote on the matter right now. She thinks they should continue talking about it. And if you have ever been in a co mmittee meeting, a meeting of a group of people trying to make a decision, you kn ow how difficult it can be to keep the meeting on track, to keep everyone from go ing off on a tangent.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lynda: Could I say one more thing about that?

Bruce: I’m afraid we’re running short on time. Mayb e we could wrap up this discussion now.

Lynda: Before we leave this topic, though, I really  think we should talk about next year’s plans.

Bruce: That’s outside the scope of this meeting. We  can put it on the agenda for next time.

Lynda: But we won’t meet again for a month. We shou ld spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should co nsider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin. It would save us a lot of money.

Lynda: We can’t make any decisions when there are s till so many unresolved issues. Things are still up in the air because we d on’t know what will happen next year. Any decisions we make now will be moot if our  assumptions are wrong.

Bruce: I’m afraid we differ on that. I think we hav e enough information now to forge ahead. We can come to some tentative decision s and make any adjustments later. Should we take it to a vote?

Lynda: If you insist. I still think it’s premature.

Bruce: I’ll take that as a “no” vote.

# Having a Picnic

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,093 – Having a Picnic.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  1,093. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Take a look at our ESL Podcast Business and Daily E nglish Courses. You can download these courses immediately and start improv ing your English right away.

This episode is a dialogue between Bill and Madison  about having a picnic – going out and eating outside somewhere. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Bill: Surprise! I brought you here to this beautifu l spot for a romantic picnic. I have a very special question to ask you.

Madison: Oh, that’s so sweet. Did you remember to bring a picnic blanket?

Bill: I did. I have everything we’ll need in this p icnic basket.

Madison: Don’t put it down there. There are ants. You should put it on the blanket.

Bill: Yes, you’re right.

Madison: And I hope you remembered to bring somethi ng to drink. I’m thirsty.

Bill: I brought both food and a bottle of champagne .

Madison: Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold and t he champagne isn’t too warm. You know how I hate warm champagne.

Bill: Actually, the food is cold, because I brought  chicken sandwiches and potato salad.

Madison: Oh, I thought you would have brought somet hing a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special.

 Bill: That’s why I brought the champagne. It’ll mak e this picnic extra special.

Madison: I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches. I hope you remembered to bring a corkscrew and some  dishes and silverware.

Bill: I bought paper plates and plastic utensils.

Madison: Paper and plastic? I guess we’ll have to make do with those, too. Okay, now, you said you had a special question you wanted  to ask me. What is it?

Bill: Question? Oh, never mind. It’ll keep.

[end of dialogue]

Bill says to Madison, “Surprise! I brought you here  to this beautiful spot for a romantic picnic.” A “spot” (spot) here just means a  location or area. Bill has brought Madison, his wife or girlfriend – maybe it’ s the girlfriend and the wife is at home, I don’t know – to this beautiful spot for a r omantic picnic. A “picnic” (picnic) is a meal that you usually eat in a park or in some  nice area. You often sit on the grass and have a small meal – a lunch, let’s say.

Bill says, “I have a very special question to ask y ou.” Madison says, “Oh, that’s so sweet.” If something is “sweet,” it’s nice, or p erhaps in this case, “romantic.” Madison asks, “Did you remember to bring a picnic b lanket?” A “blanket” (blanket) is normally something you put over yourse lf to keep warm. Here, however, it’s used to mean something you would put on the ground so that you don’t have to sit on the dirt or perhaps on the wet  grass.

Bill says, “I did,” meaning I did remember. “I have  everything we’ll need in this picnic basket.” A “picnic basket” (basket) is usual ly a large container in which you put the items you will need for your picnic. So, yo u put all of your food and your plates, your napkins, your knives and forks, if you  need them, into this large container called a “basket.” A picnic basket is use d to transport food and other items needed for a picnic.

Madison tells Bill, “Don’t put it down there. There  are ants.” “Ants” (ants) are small insects that have little body parts and legs that often go after food if it is left outdoors. Madison is telling Bill not to put the pi cnic basket in a certain place because she sees that that place has ants. She says , “You should put it on the blanket.” Bill says, “Yes, you’re right.” Madison c ontinues, “And I hope you remembered to bring something to drink. I’m thirsty .”

 Madison seems to be making a lot of demands on Bill , seems to be asking him for a lot of things. She says she’s thirsty and the refore hopes that Bill remembered to bring something to drink for her, of course. Bill says, “I brought both food and a bottle of champagne.” “Champagne” ( champagne) is a white sparkling wine, a bubbly wine that is from a certai n region in France. In order to be sold as champagne in many countries, it has to b e only from that region in France.

Madison says, “Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold  and the champagne isn’t too warm.” So, already we don’t like Madison, right? I mean, she’s complaining now that perhaps the food will be cold and the champagn e will be warm. Of course you want the champagne to be cold and, if it’s supp osed to be hot, the food to be warm. She says, “You know how I hate warm champagne .”

Bill says, “Actually, the food is cold, because I b rought chicken sandwiches and potato salad.” Bill is saying that the food is cold  but it’s supposed to be cold, because he brought some chicken sandwiches and pota to salad. A “sandwich,” of course, is a popular food in the United States. It’s made with two pieces of bread, typically, and in between the two pieces of bread you put meat, vegetables, and other things to eat.

“Potato salad” is a cold mixture of chopped potatoe s – potatoes cut up into small pieces that have been baked – combined with mayonna ise, typically, onions, celery, and some other things. Potato salad is a ve ry popular picnic food in the United States, especially during the summer. Whenev er my family would have big family parties in the summertime, there would a lways be potato salad.

Madison says, “Oh, I thought you would have brought  something a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special .” Madison is complaining now that what Bill brought on this surprise picnic isn’ t very “gourmet or lavish.” “Gourmet” (gourmet) refers to very good tasting foo d that usually is expensive and often takes a long time to prepare. The word “l avish” (lavish) as an adjective means expensive or luxurious. If we are talking abo ut food, “lavish” would be very expensive, very good-looking and good-tasting food.

Bill says, “That’s why I brought the champagne” – i n order to bring something a little special for the event. “It’ll make this picn ic extra special,” he says. Madison continues complaining, “I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches.” “To make do” is an interesting two -word phrasal verb meaning to be satisfied with something that isn’t exactly w hat you want – to be able to get

by or to survive through a certain situation not having all of the resources, all of the things that you would like to have in a perfect  world or ideally.

Madison is saying that she and Bill will “have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches.” She says, “I hope you remembered t o bring a corkscrew and some dishes and silverware.” A “corkscrew” (corkscr ew) is a special tool that you use to remove the very top of a wine or champagne b ottle. Technically, you’re removing the little piece that is put into the top of the bottle to keep the liquid inside of it. That little piece is called a “cork,”  and hence a corkscrew screws into or goes into the cork in order to allow you to pull  it out.

“Dishes” are, of course, the things that you use for eating – plates and bowls, for example. We use the term “silverware” to mean the s ame as “eating utensils” – that is to say knives, forks, and spoons. Technical ly, silverware would be eating utensils made out of or plated with silver, but we use the term more generally to mean the knives, forks, and spoons that you eat wit h.

Bill said, “I bought paper plates and plastic utens ils.” So, he has plates made of paper and utensils – that is again a knife, a fork,  a spoon – made of plastic, which is quite common on a picnic. You often bring paper and plastic to eat with. Madison is not impressed. She says, “Paper and plas tic?” She’s not happy. She continues, “I guess we’ll have to make do with thos e, too. Okay, now, you said you had a special question you wanted to ask me. What is it?”

We can guess by now that Bill was going to ask Madi son to marry him. He was going to propose to her. “To propose” here means to  ask someone to marry you. But after all of the questions that Madison has ask ed, all the complaints that she has, Bill has decided, we believe, not to ask Madis on to marry him. He says, “Question? Oh, never mind.” “Never mind” is a phrase meaning that whatever you were talking about is not important and that the other person should just forget about it.

He says that the question “will keep” (keep). To say something will keep means that it doesn’t have to be done right now, or it do esn’t have to be talked about right now. It’s something you can do in the future.  Maybe Bill will change his mind and decide never to ask Madison to marry him. That would be my advice.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bill: Surprise! I brought you here to this beautifu l spot for a romantic picnic. I have a very special question to ask you.

Madison: Oh, that’s so sweet. Did you remember to bring a picnic blanket?

# Tracing One¡¦s Genealogy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,094 – Tracing One’s Genealogy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,094. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at ESLPod.com. Become a member of  ESL Podcast. You will get a Learning Guide, if you do, for each and every  one of our current episodes. The Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary d efinitions, cultural notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say.

This episode is a dialogue about your genealogy – w ho your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and so forth are.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Aaron: Do you think you can help me trace my geneal ogy?

Corrie: Sure, I can try. We can get started by talk ing to your parents and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some nam es of your relatives.

Aaron: I’ve already talked to them and I grew up he aring stories about my lineage on both sides of my family.

Corrie: That’s great. If you know of some of the pe ople you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and histo rical records from the area. You’re from Tennessee, right?

Aaron: That’s right. There are a lot of people in T ennessee with my last name, though.

Corrie: Well, we can triangulate the information we  get to zero in on your ancestors.

Aaron: What if I want proof positive that I’m relat ed to someone?

Corrie: Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.

Aaron: Good, it’s about time someone in my family e stablished the blood connections.

Corrie: Blood connections to whom?

Aaron: Elvis, of course.

Corrie: Elvis?! You think you’re related to Elvis?

Aaron: His last name was Presley; my last name is P resley. My first name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coi ncidence, especially considering my talent.

Corrie: Talent?

Aaron: Sure, listen: “Well, it’s one for the money,  two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!”

Corrie: I consider that counterevidence!

[end of dialogue]

Aaron begins our dialogue by asking Corey, “Do you think you can help me trace my genealogy?” Your “genealogy” (genealogy) is a li st or a description of the relatives that you have – your parents, your cousin s, your grandparents, your uncles – all the way back to however far back you can trace your genealogy. The verb “to trace” (trace) here means to follow, to fi nd out where something begins.

People often talk about being able to trace their g enealogy back to medieval England or to the seventeenth century. Another term  for genealogy is “family tree.” Your family tree is the same as your genealo gy. It’s a list or description of all the people who are related to you, including al l of those who came before you. Corrie says, “Sure, I can try” – I can try to help you trace your genealogy, she’s saying. “We can get started by talking to your pare nts and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some names of your relative s.”

Your “relatives” (relatives) are the people who are  related to you, who are part of your family, either as brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents – any of those relationships refer to your “relatives .” Corrie suggests doing “oral interviews” – sitting down and talking to someone a nd either recording what they say or writing down what they say.

Of course, if you want to find out who your ancesto rs were – the people who came before you, your relatives from previous gener ations – you would need to or would be highly advised to talk to your grandpar ents and your parents to get started in finding out the names of the people who are related to you. Aaron says, “I’ve already talked to them,” meaning his pa rents and grandparents. “I grew up hearing stories about my lineage on both si des of my family,” he says. The term “lineage” (lineage) refers to a descriptio n of how you are related to someone in a previous generation or born before.

I use the term “generation” a couple of times here.  Let me explain what I mean by that. You and your brothers and sisters and your  cousins are all one generation. Your parents and your aunts and uncles are another generation. Your grandparents are another generation. You could  create a diagram or a chart that shows these different generations as different  lines on the chart or on the diagram.

Corrie says, “That’s great. If you know some of the  people you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and  historical records from the area.” The expression “to be descended (descended) from” someone means to be the child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so forth of a person. So, I am descended from my parents, Patrick and Mary McQuill an. I’m also descended from my grandparents and my great-grandparents. The se are people who came before me who are my relatives.

“Public records” refers to government records that anyone can go and look at. Not all the records or information that the governm ent has are public, however. Some of it is not information you can look at, but a lot of information that the government collects is public – anyone can go and l ook at it. That has been made even easier now with the Internet. “Historical  records” or “historical information” are written histories or written piece s of information about what happened in the past.

So, public records are also historical records in m any cases, but historical records can refer to other documents, other informa tion that is available, including perhaps a local history about the area fr om which your ancestors came. Corrie then asks Aaron, “You’re from Tennessee, rig ht?” Aaron says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct. “There are a lot of  people in Tennessee with my last name, though.” Corrie says, “Well we can trian gulate the information we get to zero in on your ancestors.”

Aaron is saying that he’s from the state of Tenness ee, which is located in the central-eastern part of the United States. However,  there are many different

people in Tennessee with his same last name. Theref ore, if you are looking in the public records or in historical records, there will  be a lot of people who have Aaron’s last name who may or may not be his relativ es. Corrie says that they can “triangulate the information.” “To triangulate” (tr iangulate) can mean to measure something that is the length or height of something  that you don’t know by using other measurements.

However, in a more general sense, “to triangulate” means to take different pieces of information in order to narrow down the options or in order to identify the relevant object or thing. In this case, it means to  take other information about the people who have Aaron’s last name in Tennessee and use that other information to decide which of the people who have his last nam e are actually his relatives. That’s why Corrie says, “We can triangulate the inf ormation we get to zero in on your ancestors.”

“To zero (zero) in on” something is to focus your a ttention on something, to identify one thing. In this case, they are identify ing Aaron’s ancestors – his relatives who came before him. Aaron then asks, “What if I want proof positive that I’m related to someone?” “Proof” (proof) is ev idence, clear evidence that shows something is either true or false. So, “proof  positive” would be clear evidence, detailed evidence that is absolutely cert ain, that tells you with certainty whether something is true or not.

Corrie says, “Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.” A “genetic analysis” is a study of biological information that can help identify who your relatives are. The most common way is to use your DNA. Your DNA is the specific biological infor mation that identifies you. “DNA” is the biological information inside your bod y’s cells, the smallest or one of the smallest units of your biological makeup. DNA d etermines a lot of different things about the individual human being and can be used to identify people who are related to you.

Aaron says, “Good. It’s about time someone in my fa mily established the blood connections.” “It’s about time” is a phrase that we  use to mean that we have been waiting for something for a long time, and now  we are pleased or happy to learn that it has finally happened. “It’s about tim e someone in my family,” Aaron says, “established the blood connections,” meaning the biological relationship.

Corrie’s a little confused. She says, “Blood connec tions to whom?” – to what specific person are you talking about? Aaron says, “Elvis, of course.” He means the famous singer Elvis Presley. Corrie says, “Elvi s?! You think you’re related to Elvis?” Aaron says, “His last name was Presley; my last name is Presley. My first

name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coincidence, especially considering my talent.” A “coincidence” is a somewh at surprising, unexpected set of events that happen at the same time or that are somehow related without any planning or apparent purpose.

In this case, Aaron is saying that he shares names with Elvis Presley and he also is talented like Elvis Presley. Corrie says, “Talen t?” Aaron says, “Sure, listen,” and then he sings a line from one of Elvis Presley’ s most famous songs: “Well, it’s one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!” That, of course, is a line from “Blue Suede Shoes,”  a song by Elvis Presley (sung very badly – I know).

Corrie says, “I consider that counterevidence.” In other words, she’s listened to Aaron sing, and she doesn’t think that the singing talent that Aaron has is anything like the singing talent that Elvis Presley  had. That’s why she says that Aaron’s singing is “counterevidence.” Countereviden ce would be some indication, some fact, that would show that what yo u are saying is not true or is not possible. Aaron’s bad singing shows, according to Corrie, that he’s probably not a relative of the great singer Elvis Presley.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Aaron: Do you think you can help me trace my geneal ogy?

Corrie: Sure, I can try. We can get started by talk ing to your parents and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some nam es of your relatives.

Aaron: I’ve already talked to them and I grew up he aring stories about my lineage on both sides of my family.

Corrie: That’s great. If you know of some of the pe ople you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and histo rical records from the area. You’re from Tennessee, right?

Aaron: That’s right. There are a lot of people in T ennessee with my last name, though.

Corrie: Well, we can triangulate the information we  get to zero in on your ancestors.

 Aaron: What if I want proof positive that I’m relat ed to someone?

Corrie: Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof.

Aaron: Good, it’s about time someone in my family e stablished the blood connections.

Corrie: Blood connections to whom?

Aaron: Elvis, of course.

Corrie: Elvis?! You think you’re related to Elvis?

Aaron: His last name was Presley; my last name is P resley. My first name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coi ncidence, especially considering my talent.

Corrie: Talent?

Aaron: Sure, listen: “Well, it’s one for the money,  two for the show, three to get ready, now go, cat, go!”

Corrie: I consider that counterevidence!

If I were to zero in on the main reason these podca sts are successful, I would have to say that it is the scriptwriting by the won derful Dr. Lucy Tse.

This episode is a dialogue between a mother and her  son about keeping fit – about being healthy and having a healthy body. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Hold it right there. Put that candy bar down.

Justin: Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.

Mom: Don’t you remember what Dad said about this fa mily’s need to improve our level of fitness?

Justin: Only old people have to worry about getting  fat.

Mom: It’s not just about getting fat.

Justin: But I’m just a kid. I’m in great shape.

Mom: Childhood obesity is a huge problem in this co untry. Even if you’re not overweight, people your age lead sedentary lives.

Justin: Whatever that means.

Mom: It means that you sit around all day as couch potatoes watching TV and playing video games. In my day, kids went outside t o ride their bikes, climb trees, and run around.

Justin: I don’t have that kind of energy.

Mom: Precisely! You and your brothers are lethargic  because you don’t get enough exercise.

Justin: But exercise is tiring.

Mom: That’s because you’re not fit. You have no sta mina or endurance.

Justin: I don’t need endurance.

Mom: Stop grumbling. It’s Saturday and you boys sho uld be outside getting some fresh air.

Justin: In Los Angeles?

Mom: Are you smart mouthing me, young man? Get outs ide or you’ll all be helping me clean the house.

Justin: We’re out of here!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the mother saying to the s on, whose name is Justin, “Hold it right there.” “Hold it right there” is a p hrase we use when we want someone to stop doing what he or she is doing. Usua lly it’s a phrase used by someone in authority, such as a parent, or perhaps a police officer. If the police officer says to you, “Hold it right there,” he or s he means you should stop doing what you’re doing and don’t move. Mom is telling Ju stin to hold it right there – to stop what he is doing.

She tells him, “Put that candy bar down.” “To put s omething down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to take it and put it on a tab le or on the floor – to remove it from your hand. A “candy bar” is, of course, a kind  of sweet that is popular with children. Justin says, “Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.” A “snack” (snack) is a small piece of food in between your ma in meals. “To tide (tide) someone over” is a phrasal verb meaning to give som eone enough resources – energy, money, food – in order to survive or last u ntil some future point at which they will get more money, energy, or food.

If you say to someone, “I need twenty dollars to ti de me over until the end of the week when I get paid at my job,” you are asking the  person for money that you can use until some point in the future – in this ca se, until the end of the week, when you will get more money.

 Mom, however, says to Justin, “Don’t you remember w hat dad said about this family’s need to improve our level of fitness?” The  mother is reminding Justin of something that his father said about the entire fam ily needing to improve their “level of fitness” (fitness). “Fitness” refers to y our physical health – whether you can walk up the stairs without running out of breat h, for example. “Fitness” refers to the physical health, the bodily health of a pers on.

Justin says, “Only old people have to worry about g etting fat.” Justin associates fitness with whether you are fat (whether you weigh  too much) or thin (whether you don’t weigh a lot). Mom says, “It’s not just ab out getting fat.” In other words, fitness is not just related to how much you weigh. Justin says, “But I’m a kid” – that is, I’m a child. “I’m in great shape.” “Shape”  (shape) here refers to your physical condition, your physical fitness.

If you’re in good shape, or as Justin describes him self, “great shape,” you are very physically fit, you are very healthy. Your bod y is “in good condition,” we might say. If you are in “bad shape,” your body is not in good condition. We can describe physical objects as being in good shape or  bad shape as well. When we do that, we’re not referring, of course, to the hea lth of the object, but rather to whether the object is in good condition or in poor condition.

Mom, however, says that “childhood obesity is a hug e problem in this country.” “Obesity” (obesity) relates to the condition of bei ng seriously overweight – not just being a little heavier, weighing a little more  than you should, but weighing a lot more than you should, such that it affects your  health. It could actually kill you or make you have a lot of physical problems. It’s s ort of strange because Mom just finished saying that fitness is not about gett ing fat, and then she goes on to talk about getting fat (“childhood obesity” – that is, children being overweight.)

“Even if you’re not overweight,” Mom says, “people your age lead sedentary lives.” “Sedentary” (sedentary) here means not movi ng very much, sitting around. When someone says they live a “sedentary life,” he means he doesn’t do a lot of exercise. He watches a lot of television, perhaps. He sits in his chair and reads or surfs the Internet, but he’s not out doing physical  activity. Mom is saying that children nowadays lead sedentary lives. They don’t go out and move and are not as physically active as perhaps they once were.

Justin, however, says, “Whatever that means.” In ot her words, Justin doesn’t understand what his mother just said. He doesn’t pe rhaps understand the word “sedentary.” Mom explains, “It means that you sit a round all day as couch potatoes watching TV and playing video games.” The term “couch” (couch) refers

to a sofa, something that you sit on – a chair for two or more people, we could also describe it as being. A “potato” is a kind of vegetable, a white vegetable – at least, when you cut it open, it’s white. A “couch p otato,” however, is a term referring to someone who’s lazy, who doesn’t move a round very much.

Mom explains, “In my day, kids went outside to ride  their bikes, climb trees, and run around.” Mom is comparing the situation when sh e was a child to today’s situation where children don’t go around climbing t rees and running around, at least not in this dialogue. Justin says, “I don’t h ave that kind of energy.” “Energy” (energy) here means strength. “To have the energy” to do something is to have the physical strength or the physical ability to do  something. Justin says he doesn’t have energy to do the things his mother is talking about.

Mom responds, “Precisely” (precisely). The term “pr ecisely” here means exactly. “That’s exactly what I’m saying,” Mom is indicating  with this term “precisely.” “You and your brothers are lethargic because you don’t g et enough exercise.” “To be lethargic” (lethargic) means to not have a lot of e nergy, to not move around, perhaps to be lazy. Mom says that her children are lethargic because they don’t get enough “exercise” (exercise).

The term “exercise” here refers to physical activit y. Going out and playing a game or running or riding a bicycle – all of these are forms of exercise, physical activity that’s good for your body. Mom says, “That ’s because you’re not fit.” “To be fit” (fit) means to be in good shape. Mom says, “You have no stamina or endurance.” “Stamina” (stamina) is the ability to d o something that is challenging, that requires a lot of energy, for a long time. If you run a marathon, a long race, you need a lot of stamina. You need a lot of energy , a lot of strength, to complete the marathon.

“Endurance” (endurance) is the ability to do someth ing that is very challenging although it doesn’t necessarily have to be somethin g physically challenging. When we talk about “stamina,” we’re usually talking  about your physical energy or strength. “Endurance” could relate to that also,  could refer to that also, but it may also be used in a wider context to refer to you r ability and what we might call “willpower” – not to give up when the situation is difficult. Justin says, “I don’t need endurance.”

Mom, however, responds, “Stop grumbling.” “To grumb le” (grumble) means to complain, usually in a low, soft, or quiet voice. I f your wife tells you to do the dishes, and you respond by saying, “Alright, I’ll d o the dishes . . .” you’re not happy, you’re complaining, but you’re not complaini ng very loudly – at least, I

don’t when my wife tells me to do the dishes. Mom s ays, “It’s Saturday and you boys should be outside getting some fresh air.”

Justin says, “In Los Angeles?” He’s making fun of h is mother in a way. He’s saying that Los Angeles – because it so polluted, b ecause the air is not very clean – is not a good place to get fresh air. The m other, however, is not happy with Justin. She says, “Are you smart mouthing me, young man?” “To smart (smart) mouth (mouth)” someone is to speak to someo ne disrespectfully, especially someone in authority, such as your mothe r or your boss. Usually it’s a term we use when children are talking back to their  parents in a disrespectful way, trying to be funny when they shouldn’t be.

Mom says, “Get outside or you’ll all be helping me clean the house.” So, Mom is telling Justin that if he doesn’t go outside right now, he and his brothers are going to be helping her clean inside the house. Justin re sponds, “We’re out of here.” The expression “to be out (out) of here” means that  we are leaving right now. It’s often used when you’re in an unpleasant or uncomfor table situation that you want to leave right away. It’s an informal expression.

You might, for example, be having an argument with your girlfriend, and your girlfriend says something or demands something of y ou and you don’t want to do it. You might say, “I’m out of here,” meaning I’m l eaving. However, it’s a very serious thing to say in that situation. You might b e saying, “I want to break up with you,” or you might be saying that you want to end the relationship. It normally is less serious than that, however. It nor mally means that you are leaving.

Sometimes it could mean simply that you are going t o leave without any sense that the current situation is a bad one. Someone ma y end a meeting by saying, “Okay, well, I have another appointment, so I’m out  of here” – I’m leaving here right now.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Hold it right there. Put that candy bar down.

Justin: Mom, I just wanted a snack to tide me over.

Mom: Don’t you remember what Dad said about this fa mily’s need to improve our level of fitness?

# Improving Online Reviews

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,096 – Improving Online Reviews.

This episode is a dialogue about improving or makin g better reviews that you read on the Internet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerrise: Okay, you were right. We need to do someth ing to improve business. Do you think we should take out an ad in the local new spaper?

Russell: We could do that, but I think a better str ategy is to improve our online reviews.

Jerrise: Who looks at websites with unsolicited rev iews? I’m not convinced that’ll help us.

Russell: Lots of people look at reviews when choosi ng which business to patronize. Right now, we only have three stars out of five, and that’s hurting us.

Jerrise: It’s hard to believe that adding a star wi ll really improve our business.

Russell: Believe it. And those mediocre reviews we received last week? We should respond to each one and try to make it right .

Jerrise: Those reviews were written by a few disgru ntled customers. We’re always going to have a few whiners.

Russell: Yes, but now they’re much more vocal. If t hey’re not happy with our service or product, we need to compensate them for their bad experience.

Jerrise: That would put us out of business!

Russell: No, that’s an investment in our business r eputation.

Jerrise: What you’re saying is that we need to brib e people to write good reviews.

Russell: I wouldn’t put it that way, but we should recognize that crowdsourcing is the wave of the future and we need to move with the  times if our business is to survive.

Jerrise: All right. I guess we can try that.

Russell: What are you doing now?

Jerrise: Writing my own review. I’ve always given m yself excellent service!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jerrise saying to Russell,  “Okay, you were right. We need to do something to improve our business. Do yo u think we should take out an ad in the local newspaper?” An “ad” (ad) is an a dvertisement – a way of promoting or letting people know about your busines s or your products.

Jerrise mentions “taking out an ad in the newspaper .” “To take out an ad” means to place or put an advertisement, in this case, in a newspaper. You can also take out an advertisement in a magazine. A more general term for this is “to place (place) an advertisement.” That’s probably a more u seful expression, because we could use that in talking about placing an adver tisement on a website, for example, or placing an advertisement on the radio.

Russell responds to Jerrise’s question by saying, “ We could do that, but I think a better strategy” – a better approach – “is to impro ve our online reviews.” “Online” refers to on the Internet – on a website, typically . A “review” is when someone posts or puts their opinion about a product or a se rvice either in a newspaper or, more commonly nowadays, on a website.

Jerrise says, “Who looks at websites with unsolicit ed reviews?” “Unsolicited” (unsolicited) is the opposite of “solicited.” “To s olicit” as a verb means to ask for. The prefix “un-” means “not.” So, “unsolicited” is something that you didn’t ask for, something that you didn’t request someone do.

Most reviews that you read online are unsolicited i n the sense that the business doesn’t ask you for a review. Sometimes they do – a  smart business will ask you to put a review of your product or service on a web site so other people can see

how much you like their product or their service – but an unsolicited review is when no one asks you. You just do it because you wa nt to.

Jerrise says, “I’m not convinced that’ll help us.” Russell says, “Lots of people look at reviews when choosing which businesses to patron ize.” “To patronize” (patronize) means to be a customer of a particular business – or at least, that’s what it means in this sentence.

Russell says, “Right now, we only have three stars out of five, and that’s hurting us.” Often when you post or place a review of a, sa y, restaurant, you are asked to give the restaurant or the product a certain num ber of stars. Usually there are five stars, at least in most American websites that  have reviews of this sort. A five-star review would be a review that says, “This  is a wonderful product. It’s the best you could ask for.” If you give a business onl y one star, that means that you didn’t like the product or service very much.

Russell says that his and Jerrise’s business has, a t least on the website they’re talking about, three stars out of five, which is ju st sort of average. Russell, in fact, thinks that it is hurting them. Jerrise says, “It’s  hard to believe that adding a star will really improve our business.” What Jerrise mea ns here is that by improving their rating, their average rating, from, say, thre e stars out of five to four stars out of five, would really help them.

But Russell says in fact it will. He says, “Believe  it,” meaning you should believe what I’m telling you is true. He continues, “And th ose mediocre reviews we received last week? We should respond to each one a nd try to make it right.” “Mediocre” (mediocre) means not very good. It’s not  a word you would use to describe something that’s terrible. It’s sort of in  between good and bad, but more on the bad side.

What Russell is saying is that their business got s ome mediocre reviews last week. He says they should try to “respond to each o ne and try to make it right.” “To make something right” means to fix something – to correct a bad situation, especially when you’re talking about a customer of your business. Jerrise says, “Those reviews were written by a few disgruntled cu stomers.” “To be disgruntled” (disgruntled) means to be unhappy, to be dissatisfi ed, to have a lot of complaints or things you don’t like about something, especiall y a business.

Jerrise says, “We’re always going to have a few whi ners.” “Whiner” (whiner) comes from the verb “to whine” (whine). “To whine” means to complain, to complain loudly, sometimes in an annoying voice. We  often associate whining with children. You know, when your child goes, “But  mom, I want to go to the

store. Please. I want to go to the store” – somethi ng like that. I don’t know. You know, when I was a child, my mother says I was an a ngel, a perfect child. I never whined. Well, that’s what she tells me, anyway. Or was that my brother?

Russell agrees with Jerrise that there will always be whiners. However, he says that the people complaining on the website are “muc h more vocal” now. “To be vocal” (vocal) means to express your opinions loudl y, usually in spoken words – however, in this case it means someone is writing m ore in their review. You can’t literally be vocal if we’re talking about writing, but we use the term when talking about writing to refer to someone who is writing a lot more than they might otherwise.

Russell says, “If the customers are not happy with our service, we need to compensate them for their bad experience.” “To comp ensate” (compensate) someone means to give something to someone – to pay  someone something, either money or something else of value, in return for what that person did, or in this case, to make up for a bad experience.

We can use the verb “to compensate” to mean the sam e as “to pay,” as in, “I’m going to compensate my employees.” I’m going to pay  them money for working for me. But here “compensate” means “to make up for ” – to do something for someone because something bad has happened to them and you are the cause of that bad experience.

Jerrise disagrees. She doesn’t think the business s hould compensate these customers who are complaining. She says, “That woul d put us out of business!” “To put someone out of business” is to make a busin ess close, usually because the business isn’t making enough money.

Russell disagrees. He says, “No, that’s an investme nt in our business reputation.” An “investment” in something is money or resources or energy you put into something in the hopes of getting more in the future back from that particular activity. “Reputation” refers to what ot her people think about you. You can have a good reputation or you can have a bad re putation.

Jerrise says, “What you’re saying is that we need t o bribe people to write good reviews.” “To bribe” (bribe) means to pay someone m oney so that he or she will do something for you, especially something that may  be considered illegal or dishonest. Don’t confuse this with the noun “bride”  (bride), which is a woman who is going to get married. Unless you want to bribe a  woman to be your bride, which is probably not a good idea.

Russell doesn’t consider this bribing. He says, “I wouldn’t put it that way,” meaning I wouldn’t say it that way. He says, “We sh ould recognize that crowdsourcing is the wave of the future and we need  to move with the times if our business is to survive.” “Crowdsourcing” (crowd sourcing) – all one word – means to use the services or opinions of many diffe rent people, usually by using the Internet somehow.

“The wave of the future” refers to the things that are becoming popular and will be common in the future or in the near future. “To move with the times” means to change and adjust your actions or behaviors to do w hat other people are doing. Jerrise says, “All right. I guess we can try that.”

Russell says, “What are you doing now?” Jerrise say s, “Writing my own review. I’ve always given myself excellent service!” Jerris e is going to write a review of her own business, saying how wonderful her business  is – which, of course, is not exactly what the website that carries these rev iews would probably want to see.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jerrise: Okay, you were right. We need to do someth ing to improve business. Do you think we should take out an ad in the local new spaper?

Russell: We could do that, but I think a better str ategy is to improve our online reviews.

Jerrise: Who looks at websites with unsolicited rev iews? I’m not convinced that’ll help us.

# Landscaping a Home

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,097 – Landscaping a Home.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,097. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Check out our ESL Podcast Special Courses in Business and Daily English that I think you’re goin g to love.

On this episode, we have a dialogue between Mona an d Kellan about landscaping a house, or making the land or area aro und the house nice and pretty, Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: I want a lawn. I’ve always pictured our new h ouse with a lawn.

Kellan: Lawns require a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the lawn and plant only drought-toleran t plants.

Mona: I don’t want my yard to be full of gravel and  rocks. I picture a water feature in the middle, with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautiful lawn.

Kellan: We can have some kind of slow-growing groun d cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.

Mona: I don’t know what you mean. We can plant a he dge over there and install planters along the walkway.

Kellan: Who will do the pruning and mulching? Who w ill pull the weeds and mow the lawn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons  change?

Mona: Well, I guess I will, with your help.

Kellan: Don’t count on me. My motto is: No muss, no  fuss!

[end of dialogue]

Mona says, “I want a lawn.” A “lawn” (lawn) is a gr een area around a house or a building with grass that is typically cut short so that it doesn’t look too long, but it looks nice. A lawn is almost always an area of “gre en grass” when we use the term in reference to a house or a building. Mona wa nts a lawn. She says, “I’ve always pictured our new house with a lawn.” She mea ns she’s always imagined having a house with a lawn.

Kellan says, however, “Lawns require a lot of water  and upkeep.” “Upkeep” (upkeep) is another word for “maintenance,” for tak ing care of something so that it looks nice and is in good condition. if you own a house, there is a certain amount of upkeep you have to do every year because houses, like all of us, get older and need repairs and other changes in order t o keep them in good condition.

Kellan doesn’t like this idea. He says, “Lawns requ ire a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the yard and plant only drought- tolerant plants.” “Hardscape” (hardscape) refers to  hard surfaces that are used in the outdoor areas around a house or a building that  take the place of grass or plants. Hardscape is usually something that is made  of stone or brick. So, instead of having grass in front of your house or i n front of your building, you might have a hardscape, where the whole thing is st one or concrete or another hard surface.

Kellan suggests using “hardscape for most of the ya rd” (yard). The word “yard” is used to refer to the space either in front of a hou se – called the “front yard” – or in back of the house, called the “backyard.” So, “y ard” is a word that we would use to describe that area, that land. If we’re talk ing about a building, a commercial building like an office building, we pro bably wouldn’t use the word “yard” to describe the area in front and in back of  the building. We would use the term “grounds” (grounds). The “grounds of the build ing” refers to the area outside of the building that’s still part of the property of that building.

Kellan wants to use hardscape for most of the yard.  He also wants to plant, or put into the ground, only “drought-tolerant plants. ” Notice that “plant” (plant) can be used as a verb or as a noun. You can plant trees . You could also say that trees are plants. Well, Kellan wants to plant “drou ght-tolerant plants.” “Drought” (drought) is when there isn’t enough water. Here in  California, we quite frequently have droughts. We don’t have enough water. A “droug ht-tolerant plant” is a plant that doesn’t need a lot of water, that can put up w ith, or “tolerate,” a drought – when you don’t have a lot of rain or water.

Mona says, “I don’t want my yard to be full of grav el and rocks.” “Gravel” (gravel) refers to small rocks, especially ones that you wou ld use on the road or on a sidewalk in front of a house. Some of the older roa ds in rural areas, in areas outside of the main cities in the United States, st ill have gravel. Not that many, but if you go into an area where there aren’t a lot  of people, some of the roads may still be gravel roads – small little rocks inst ead of a concrete or asphalt top.

Mona says, “I picture a water feature in the middle , with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautif ul lawn.” Mona is giving us what she wants in the yard. She wants a “water feature.”  A “water feature” refers to something with water, such as a small pool of water  – what we might call a “pond” (pond). Or a water feature could be a “fount ain” – something that sprays or shoots up water into the air.

The term “annuals” (annuals) refers to plants that only live for a single season or a single part of the year. If you want that plant a gain next year, you have to put a new plant in the ground, or new seeds in the ground . “Perennials” (perennials) are plants that live two or more years. So, you don ’t have to put a new plant in the ground next year. It will keep “coming up,” we might say, each year.

Kellan says, “We can have some kind of slow-growing  ground cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.” Kellan talks abo ut “slow-growing ground cover.” “Ground cover” refers to small plants that go acros s the ground but are not very tall. They’re short. What Kellan is saying is that he doesn’t want all these flowers and plants. He just wants something very simple.

Mona says, “I don’t know what you mean. We can plan t a hedge over there and install planters along the walkway.” A “hedge” (hed ge) is a tall, thick-growing plant that you cut usually in straight lines and us e as a sort of border. So, you might have a yard in front of your house, and along  the edge of the yard, along the border of the yard, you might have a plant that  goes all the way around your yard, and you cut it, and that would be what we wou ld call a “hedge.”

Usually hedges are somewhere between two and maybe four or five feet. If they are much taller than that, they become more like tr ees and we probably wouldn’t use the word “hedge.” We use plants called “bushes”  for hedges, more commonly. They’re not that tall.

Mona talks about “planters along the walkway.” “Pla nters” are large boxes, filled with soil, that have plants in them. Instead of put ting the plant in the ground, below the surface of the ground, you have a box tha t has dirt in it, and you put the plant in there. That’s a “planter.” The “walkwa y” (walkway) just refers to the

area where you walk from one place to another in fr ont of a house or a building. A “walkway” usually goes from the sidewalk or the s treet to the front of the house or building.

Kellan says, “Who will do the pruning and mulching? ” “To prune” (prune) means to cut pieces off of a plant or a tree to make it s maller. Sometimes trees or plants get too big and you have to cut them back, you have  to “prune” them. Kellan is asking who is going to do all of this work, to take  care of what Mona wants in the front yard – who is going to prune and “mulch” (mul ch)?

“To mulch” means to put certain kinds of materials on the ground in order to help keep the plants and trees healthy. Sometimes we use  the outside surface of a tree, called the “bark,” as mulch. Sometimes we use  leaves from the tree as mulch. Notice that “mulch,” like “plant,” can be bo th a verb and a noun.

Kellan says, “Who will pull the weeds and mow the l awn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons change?” “Weeds” (weeds) re fers to unwanted plants – plants that you don’t want in your yard or garden. To get rid of these plants, you have to pull them out of the ground. So, we have the expression “pull (pull) the weeds.” “To mow (mow) the lawn” is to cut the lawn or to cut the grass that is part of the lawn.

“Raking” (raking) refers to taking what looks like a big room and using it to gather together leaves that have fallen off the trees. The re is a verb “to rake,” which means to use an object called a “rake” to gather to gether the leaves, either to get rid of them or to perhaps use them as mulch around other parts of your yard.

Mona says, “Well, I guess I will, with your help.” Mona is saying she’s going to help do all of this work. Kellan says, “Don’t count  on me,” meaning don’t depend on or rely on me doing this work. If you want all t his stuff, you are going to have to do the work. That’s what Kellan seems to be sayi ng. Of course, no rational, sane, intelligent husband would talk to his wife th is way, but this is an imaginary dialogue.

Kellan says, “My motto is: No muss, no fuss!” Your “motto” (motto) is a short expression of either your belief about something, a  rule that you follow, or simply an expression that we associate with a certain inst itution or certain organization. Mottoes often express a certain standard of belief that you have, a rule that you live by. The Boy Scouts have a motto: “Be prepared, ” meaning be ready for anything.

Well, Kellan’s motto is “No muss (muss), no fuss (f uss).” “No muss, no fuss” is a phrase meaning that you want to keep things simple.  You want to reduce amount of work that you have. There’s also an expression w ith the word “fuss”: Don’t make a fuss. “Don’t make a fuss” means don’t cause problems. Don’t complain. Don’t make more difficulties for yourself or for us  than are necessary.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: I want a lawn. I’ve always pictured our new h ouse with a lawn.

Kellan: Lawns require a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the lawn and plant only drought-toleran t plants.

Mona: I don’t want my yard to be full of gravel and  rocks. I picture a water feature in the middle, with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautiful lawn.

Kellan: We can have some kind of slow-growing groun d cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.

Mona: I don’t know what you mean. We can plant a he dge over there and install planters along the walkway.

Kellan: Who will do the pruning and mulching? Who w ill pull the weeds and mow the lawn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons  change?

Mona: Well, I guess I will, with your help.

Kellan: Don’t count on me. My motto is: No muss, no  fuss!

This episode is a dialogue between Theo and Mandy a bout riding in a very big, luxurious car called a limousine. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Mandy: Whoo! Whoo!

Theo: Hey, get down from there. You shouldn’t be st icking your head out of the sunroof.

Mandy: I just wanted to get some air. This stretch limo is amazing.

Theo: Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in style.

Mandy: This is the height of luxury. You’ve really outdone yourself.

Theo: Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to  spill drinks on the seats.

Mandy: Everybody drinks and parties in the back of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?

Theo: Well, we shouldn’t be drinking out of it. We could get into trouble.

Mandy: The chauffeur doesn’t know what we’re doing back here. The partition is up and it’s soundproof.

Theo: But he could hear us on the intercom system. Let’s just relax and enjoy the ride.

Mandy: You can do that, but I’m going to blast the music and have some fun.

 Theo: This isn’t a party bus.

Mandy: No, but it could be a party limo! You’re bri lliant. Let’s go pick up a few of my friends. We’ll turn this into a great party.

Theo: What about the prom?

Mandy: We’ll get there, but first we’re going to ha ve a pre-party in our own party limo. What a great idea!

Theo: Me and my big mouth.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is all about a “limousine” (limousine) . A limousine is a big car, often a car that has six, eight, or even more doors on it , that is used for special events or for very special people. It’s a big car. It’s wh at we might call a “luxury car.” You can often put six, eight, perhaps ten or more peopl e in a limousine, depending on how big it is.

Mandy begins our dialogue by shouting, “Whoo! Whoo! ” or something like that. Theo says, “Hey, get down from there.” We tell some one to “get down” from somewhere when they have climbed up or gotten on to p of something that they shouldn’t be on – or in this case, that they are st anding up when they should not be standing up.

Theo says to Mandy, “You shouldn’t be sticking your  head out of the sunroof.” “To stick (stick) your head out of” something is to  put your head through some sort of opening, usually a window, but here Mandy i s sticking her head out of a “sunroof” (sunroof). The “roof” of a car is the top  of the car. We use that same word “roof” to describe the top of a house or a bui lding. A “roof” is on the outside of a house or a building or, in this case, a car. T he inside top of a room inside of a house or building is called the “ceiling” (ceilin g).

We’re talking, in this dialogue, about a “sunroof.”  A sunroof is basically a door that is at the top of the car – cut into the roof –  that you can open and stick your head out of. Now, there is also another similar con cept that is actually more popular in cars today, called a “moonroof.” A moonr oof is a window at the top of the car, cut into the top of the car. You can’t sti ck your head out of it, but you can see out of it.

Moonroofs usually have covers on them so you can op en or close the cover depending on whether you want light or not inside of the car – coming from the top, of course. Mandy says, “I just want to get som e air.” People use that expression “to get some air.” It means to go outsid e and breathe in fresh air. You can do that in most places except here in Los Angel es, where the air is so polluted you’re probably better off staying inside.

Manny continues, “This stretch limo is amazing.” “L imo” (limo) is short for “limousine.” A “stretch (stretch) limo” is a very l ong limousine. Now, limousines are very long cars anyway, but a stretch limo is a really long limousine. You’ve probably seen one, or at least seen one in the movi es.

Some people get a limousine for their wedding day a nd they like to ride in the limousine before the wedding – or I guess after the  wedding, really. I don’t know. I didn’t have a limousine for my wedding. I had a b icycle. Yeah, my wife and I, after we got married, we got on a bicycle – you kno w, one of those bicycles for two – and then we pedaled away. We rode to the part y, to the reception. Really.

Mandy is in a stretch limo and she thinks it’s amaz ing. Theo says, “Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in st yle.” Now we learn exactly why Mandy and Theo are in a limo. They’re going to some thing called the “prom” (prom). The prom is a formal dance party that is po pular in many American high schools, and it has been for many years. It’s usual ly during the spring of the school year and is primarily for the students who a re in their senior or last year – the “graduating students,” we might call them.

Prom is one of the few occasions where high school students get dressed up very nicely, and it’s considered a big party night for couples. To go to the prom is considered sort of part of one’s high school experi ence in the United States. Not everyone goes to the prom. I didn’t go to the prom.  Why? Well, I didn’t have a girlfriend. Sad, I know.

In our dialogue, Theo wants to take Mandy “to the p rom in style.” “In style” means in a fashionable, popular way, often one that costs  a lot of money. If you say, “I’m going to do something in style,” you mean you are g oing to do it in a way that other people will admire, perhaps, and that also mi ght cost you a little money. Some children of richer parents will get a stretch limo or a limo for their prom night.

Mandy says, “This is the height of luxury.” The “he ight (height) of” something is an extreme example of something or the strongest ex ample of something. It could also refer to the biggest amount of something . “Luxury” (luxury) is

something that is very comfortable – often, again, something that costs a lot of money. So, “the height of luxury” would be the most  luxurious situation you could imagine.

Mandy says to Theo, “You’ve really outdone yourself .” “To outdo” (outdo) – one word – “yourself” is to do something better than an yone thought you could do, to do something better than you have done it before. W e might also define this verb as “to surpass expectations.”

Theo says, “Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to spill drinks on the seats.” “To spill” (spill) means to accidentally ca use a liquid to leave its container. So, for example, if you have a glass of water and y ou move your hand or arm too quickly, the water might spill out of the glass – i t might come out of the glass. Theo is warning Mandy not to spill drinks on the se ats of the car.

Mandy says, “Everybody drinks and parties in the ba ck of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?” A “wet bar” is usually a smal l counter, a small piece of furniture that has a small sink in it, used to mix alcoholic drinks. Now remember, these kids are in high school, and of course they s houldn’t be drinking, legally, if they are in high school. Theo says, “Well we should n’t be drinking out of it,” meaning we shouldn’t be taking drinks out of this w et bar.

Mandy says, “The chauffeur doesn’t know what we’re doing back here. The partition is up and it’s soundproof.” The “chauffeu r” (chauffeur) is the person whose job it is to drive the car – in this case, to  drive the limousine. The “partition” (partition) is the thing that divides t he place where the driver is and those in the other part of the limousine, in the ba ck part of the limousine. A partition is anything that divides a room or a spac e into two different sections.

“The partition is up,” Mandy says, meaning that the re is something like a wall between where the chauffeur is, the driver is, and where they are sitting, so the driver can’t see them. Mandy also says that this pa rticular partition is “soundproof” (soundproof). If something is soundpro of, you can’t hear what’s on the other side of it. Theo says, “But he could hear  us on the intercom system.” An “intercom (intercom) system” is a system that allow s you to talk to people in another room of a house or a building, usually one that is at a distance from where you are.

The house where I grew up had an intercom system. I t was three stories, or three levels, and my parents wanted to be able to yell at  us – I mean, talk to us – when we were on the top floor, in our bedroom, so they p ut in an intercom system, which also allowed them to listen to us through the  intercom – and that’s what

Theo is talking about here. He’s saying the chauffe ur could listen to them talking through the intercom system in the limousine.

He says, “Let’s just relax and enjoy the ride.” Man dy says, “You can do that, but I’m going to blast the music and have some fun.” “T o blast (blast) music” means to play it very loudly, as teenagers sometimes do. Theo reminds Mandy that “This isn’t a party bus.” A “party bus” would be a large bus, a large vehicle that has been modified so that people can have a party i n it as it is moving them one place to another.

This has become popular I guess recently, at least here in Los Angeles. People have these big buses that they use for parties. See ms kind of strange to me, but then again, many things here in Los Angeles seem st range to me. Mandy says, “No” – this isn’t a party bus – “but it could be a party limo!” Then she says, “You’re brilliant,” meaning you’re very intelligent . “Let’s go pick up a few of my friends,” meaning let’s go to my friends’ houses an d get them to come in to the car or ride in the car with us.

“We’ll turn this into a great party,” Mandy says. T heo says, “What about the prom?” meaning “Aren’t we going to go to the prom?”  Mandy says, “We’ll get there, but first we’re going to have a pre-party in  our own party limo.” A “pre (pre) – party” would, I guess, be the party that happens before the main party. “What a great idea!” Mandy says.

Theo ends the dialogue by saying, “Me and my big mo uth.” This is a phrase we use when you regret what you have said, when you wi sh that you had not said something that you had said. The reason you regret it or feel badly about saying it is because another person took you seriously and  actually did what you said or what you suggested even though that wasn’t really w hat you had in mind or wasn’t what you intended. It could also be used whe n you say something that gets you in trouble, something that you shouldn’t h ave said.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mandy: Whoo! Whoo!

Theo: Hey, get down from there. You shouldn’t be st icking your head out of the sunroof.

Mandy: I just wanted to get some air. This stretch limo is amazing.

 Theo: Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in style.

Mandy: This is the height of luxury. You’ve really outdone yourself.

Theo: Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to  spill drinks on the seats.

Mandy: Everybody drinks and parties in the back of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?

On this episode, we’re going to listen to Angela an d Juan talk about children who get hurt playing sports. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela: Wait! I need to put sunscreen on Davy befor e he goes to the game.

Juan: It’s not sunny today. He doesn’t need sunscre en.

Angela: And here are four water bottles to make sur e he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.

Juan: One of the other parents is bringing drinks f or the kids. It’s fine. We don’t need that.

Angela: Make sure Davy warms up and cools down befo re and after the game. I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.

Juan: The coach makes sure they do that. Are you do ne?

Angela: And here’s a first-aid kit in case he skins  his knee or gets any other scrapes. We don’t want to risk infection.

Juan: The reason we signed up Davy for organized sp orts is that all of this is taken care of. There’s even a certified athletic tr ainer at each game, one of the parents.

Angela: But the other kids can be so rough. He come s home with bruises all the time. I can’t stand seeing him hurt.

Juan: Do you want to come to the game? You can see for yourself that everything is fine.

Angela: How can I watch Davy running into danger? I ’d want to run onto the field and save him.

Juan: You’re right. It’s better that you stay here.  If you did that, your son would never live it down!

[end of dialogue]

Angela begins our dialogue by saying, “Wait! I need  to put sunscreen on Davy before he goes to the game.” Davy, we learn, is a c hild. Angela wants to put “sunscreen” (sunscreen) on him. Sunscreen is a crea m or a liquid that you put on your skin to prevent getting sunburnt – to prevent sunburn, the redness of your skin that is caused by too much sun. People like me , who come from a northern European climate originally (my ancestors, anyway),  have to be very careful about sunscreen because I, like many of my fellow I rishmen, often get sunburnt when we go out and stay in the sun too long.

Juan says, however, “It’s not sunny today. He doesn ’t need sunscreen.” Juan says the sun isn’t even shining today. You don’t ha ve to worry about that. Angela, however, continues, “And here are four wate r bottles to make sure he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.” “To be hydrated” (hydrated) means to have enough water so that you don’t get sick.

“Heatstroke” (stroke) is a dangerous medical condit ion caused by the human body getting too hot, and that can happen if you are out in the sun and if you’re not drinking water – at least, that’s what Angela t hinks. Juan says, “One of the other parents is bringing drinks for the kids.” In other words, Davy doesn’t need to bring his own water. One of the other parents wi ll bring water.

Angela says, “Make sure Davy warms up and cools dow n before and after the game.” What Angela means here is that she wants Dav y to warm up before the game and cool down after the game. “To warm up” her e refers to gradually increasing your physical activity before exercising  or playing some sort of sport. Many athletes – people who play sports – warm up be fore the main activity or the main thing they are doing in their exercising or in  their sporting activity.

“To cool down” is to gradually decrease your physic al activity when you have finished exercising or playing a sport. Angela expl ains, “I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.” “To strain” (strain) means to stretch a muscle so far that you hurt it. You might actually even “tear” (tear) the muscle, which is basically ripping the muscle or causing the muscle to break in some w ay.

“To sprain” (sprain) means to stretch not a muscle,  but what’s called a “ligament.” A “ligament” (ligament) is a tissue, a part of your  body, that connects bones. Juan says, “The coach makes sure they do that.” The “coa ch” (coach) is the person whose job it is to help an athlete or a team perfor m well and ultimately to win the game that the team or the person is playing.

I can never hear the word “coach” without thinking of my father. The reason is this: my father was a gym teacher, a physical educa tion teacher. He was the teacher in school that taught the kids games and he lped them participate in sporting events. Well, he taught in a somewhat smal l school, a special school, and he was known by all of the children and the adu lts in the school simply as “Coach.” That’s what they called him. They didn’t s ay “Mr. McQuillan.” They said “Coach.”

I remember as a child going to his school with him one day and hearing the teachers address him, or talk to him, with the name  “Coach.” “Hey, Coach. How is it going today?” “How are you doing, Coach?” I t hought, “Why are they calling my father ‘Coach’?” But that’s what they called him  for the 34 years that he taught in the St. Paul public schools. But back to our story.

Juan says to Angela, “Are you done?” meaning “Have you finished giving me things and instructing me?” He wants to get going t o take Davy to his game. Angela, however, is not finished. She says, “And he re’s a first-aid kit in case he skins his knee or gets any other scrapes. We don’t want to risk infection.” A “first- aid (aid) kit (kit)” is a small box that has basic medical supplies in it. It’s something that you would have at a sporting event o r a game like this in case you needed to take care of any small medical issues .

One of the things that might happen in a sporting g ame would be “skinning your knee.” “To skin (skin) your knee (knee)” is to caus e the skin around or near your knee to break and to “bleed” (bleed). “To bleed” is  to allow blood or to have blood come out of your body. Angela is worried that littl e Davy is going to skin his knee or get another kind of “scrape” (scrape). A scrape is also an injury to your skin. We might also call it a “cut” or a “scratch” that i s caused by having the skin rub up against or touch a sharp surface or object.

Angela says, “We don’t want to risk infection.” “To  risk” something is to take the chance that something bad will happen. The bad thin g in this case is an “infection” (infection). An infection is when there  is something in your body that is causing you pain or making you ill.

Juan says, “The reason we signed up Davy for organi zed sports is that all of this is taken care of.” Juan is saying to Angela that th ey “signed Davy up,” meaning they agreed to have Davy participate in this activi ty, because “all of this is taken care of,” meaning all of these problems that Angela  is worried about will be taken care of by the organization that is running this pa rticular sporting activity.

“Organized sports” refers to athletic activity, usu ally involving teens, that is coordinated and organized by some organizations, so me group of people. Juan says, “There’s even a certified athletic trainer at  each game, one of the parents.” A “certified athletic trainer” (trainer) would be s omeone who has some medical knowledge or qualifications that would be sufficien t to take care of minor injuries and problems that might happen to one of the player s in the game.

Angela is not convinced. She says, “But the other k ids can be so rough.” “To be rough” (rough) means to, in this case, play a physi cal activity or participate in a physical activity that might cause someone to get h urt. Really, it means to play in such a way or in such a manner that would result in  someone getting hurt. It can cause people to get injured or hurt – even killed s ometimes.

Angela continues, “He comes home with bruises all t he time. I can’t stand seeing him hurt.” “Bruises” (bruises) are temporary discol ored areas on your skin, usually circles of purple or dark green that are ca used by someone hitting himself or someone getting hit, more likely by another pers on. If, for example, I take my hand and close it up into a ball called a “fist” an d hit you hard, it might cause a bruise. Later on, your skin may turn a different co lor, a dark color.

Angela is complaining that Davy often comes home fr om these games with bruises. Juan says, “Do you want to come to the gam e? You can see for yourself that everything is fine.” Angela says, “How can I w atch Davy running into danger? I’d want to run out onto the field and save  him.” Angela says she can’t go to the game and watch Davy because if she did, s he would go out and try to protect her son during the game. Juan then says, “Y ou’re right. It’s better that you stay here. If you did that,” meaning if you went to  the game and tried to protect Davy, “your son will never live it down.”

“To live (live) something down” means to have somet hing embarrassing happen to you and then try to continue on with your normal  life – when you hope other

people have finally forgotten about this embarrassi ng moment that you have. Usually when we use this expression, it’s with the word “never.” “I will never live that down.” That means that you did something embar rassing or something embarrassing happened to you that everyone will alw ays remember. No one will forget.

Now of course, most people do forget, and we usuall y worry about our embarrassing moments more than we should. What Juan  means here in the dialogue is that if Angela, Davy’s mother, would go  to a game and do what she said she might do, which is run out onto the playin g field to protect her son, her son would never live that down. Her son would alway s be embarrassed by what his mother had done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angela: Wait! I need to put sunscreen on Davy befor e he goes to the game.

Juan: It’s not sunny today. He doesn’t need sunscre en.

Angela: And here are four water bottles to make sur e he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.

Juan: One of the other parents is bringing drinks f or the kids. It’s fine. We don’t need that.

Angela: Make sure Davy warms up and cools down befo re and after the game. I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.

Jake: I’m glad to hear it. We’re prepared to offer you a starting salary of $55,000. You will get full medical and dental coverage, and vision coverage is optional.

Salima: No, not a deal-breaker at all. I’m just a f an.

Jake: In that case, it would be a pleasure to welco me you aboard.

We listen in on a phone conversation in this episod e. Salima answers the phone by saying, “Hello.” Jake says “Hi, this is Jake Nag ano at Fixit Corp. How are you today?” “Corp.” is a short word for “corporation,” which is another word for a company. Jake works for Fixit Corp. Salima says, “O h, hi, Jake. I’m fine. How are you?” Jake says, “Good.” Then Jake gets to the purp ose of his call, and notice how he introduces that.

In a business setting, one often uses the phrase “T he reason I’m calling is that,” and then you give the person the reason that you are calling. Well, here Jake says, “The reason I’m calling is that we’d like to offer you the position you interviewed for last week.” “To offer someone a pos ition” is to tell someone that you want to give him a job – and of course the pers on, if he wants the job, will accept your offer or not. Here Jake is offering Sal ima this position, this job for which she interviewed last week.

Salima says, “Oh, that’s great. I was really impres sed with Fixit.” “To be impressed” here means to have a very positive react ion to, or a very positive idea about, in this case, the company. Jake says, “I’m g lad to hear it,” meaning I’m happy that you liked our company. “We’re prepared t o offer you a starting salary of $55,000.” “We’re prepared” means we are willing to give you a starting salary of $55,000.

A “starting salary” is the amount of money you get paid when you first start working for a company. “Salary” (salary) is the amo unt of money you get at your job, the amount of money the company pays you to wo rk for them. Jake says, “You will get full medical and dental coverage, and  vision coverage is optional.” Jake is telling Salima that the company, Fixit Corp , will pay for her medical and dental coverage. “Medical and dental coverage” refe rs to health insurance that will pay for your bills, your expenses, if you get sick.

In the United States, some companies pay for all of  the health insurance, although my guess is most companies will pay for pa rt of the insurance. You have to pay for part of it yourself. It depends on the company. “Vision (vision) coverage” refers to health insurance for any proble ms you have with your eyes. If you need glasses or you need to have some special s urgery done on your eye, it might be covered – that is, it might be paid for – by vision insurance.

Salima says, “I see,” meaning “I understand.” “And vacation time?” Salima is asking how many days of vacation she gets. Jake say s, “Vacation days, personal leave, and sick leave accrue one day per month in y our first year and then increase with your tenure with the company.” “Vacat ion days” refer to the days that you don’t have to go to work and get paid for it – days that you would go on a holiday or just sit home and relax, which is what  I often do on my vacation.

“Personal leave” (leave) refers to one or more days  when you don’t work, not because you’re on a vacation, but because you have some other personal reason for not being able to go to work. Maybe you have to have surgery done, or maybe a friend of yours needs help and you have to call your job and say you can’t go that day. Some companies will give their e mployees a certain number of personal days. This is part of “personal leave.” the word “leave” here means days that you are not working, time that you are no t working at your job.

Usually when you take a personal day or personal le ave, you are still getting paid by the company, just as you would on your vacation.  “Sick leave,” you probably can guess, refers to days that you are sick and the refore cannot go to work. These “accrue,” according to Jake, “one day per mon th.” “To accrue” (accrue) means they accumulate, they increase gradually. Bas ically what Jake is saying here is that every month that Salima works at Fixit  Corp, she will get a little bit more vacation time, a little bit more personal leav e. She’ll get one day per month.

Now, it’s not clear if that one day a month policy applies to vacation, personal leave, and sick leave. I’m guessing it doesn’t. Tha t would be a lot of paid time off from your job – but who knows? Maybe Fixit Corp has  a lot of money. Jake says the vacation days, personal leave, and sick leave w ill increase with Salima’s

tenure with the company. Your “tenure” (tenure) is the amount of time that you are working at a certain company. In most companies , the longer you work at the company, the more vacation time and personal leave you are given.

Selena then asks, “What would be my job title?” You r “job title” is the name of the position that you have in the company or in the org anization. Jake says, “You’d be a junior specialist, and you’d be working under Monique Stansfield, the department manager.” The term “junior” (junior) ref ers to someone with less experience and usually fewer responsibilities in a company. The opposite of “junior” would be “senior” (senior).

So, a “senior specialist” would be someone who work s for a company, who has a lot of experience and a lot of responsibilities. A “junior specialist” would be someone who is new to the company, who doesn’t have  as much experience as other people at the company and probably has fewer responsibilities in the job. Jake says that Salima will “be working under Moniqu e Stansfield.” “To work under” someone is to be supervised by someone. In t his case, it means that Monique Stansfield will be Salima’s “boss” – the pe rson that Salima reports to or is supervised by.

Salima says, “Is the salary negotiable at all?” Whe n we say something is “negotiable” (negotiable) we mean it’s open for dis cussion. It’s something that you can ask for an increase in. In many job offers,  salary is negotiable. You can say, “Well, $55,000 isn’t a lot. Can I get a little  bit more? Could I get $60,000? Or could I get $70,000?” Jake answers by saying, “Well , we would consider any counteroffers, but this is a typical compensation p ackage for new hires in these positions.”

Jake says that Fixit Corp will “consider counteroff ers” (counteroffers). “Counteroffers” are proposals that you make back to  someone who has offered you something. In this case, Fixit Corp has offered  Salima $55,000. Salima can then say, “Well, I’d like $60,000.” That is a “coun teroffer.” You offer me one thing, I offer something different back to you. That’s par t of negotiation.

Jake says, however, that what the company is offeri ng Salima is a “typical,” or usual, “compensation package.” “Compensation packag e” just refers to the combination of the salary and the benefits that are  given to someone for working at a company. It refers to both the money, that is,  and in this case the insurance and the vacation days and sick leave and the person al leave all together. Those things are part of the compensation package. “Compe nsation” comes from the verb “to compensate,” which means to give someone s omething for his or her efforts or work.

 Jake says, “Why don’t you think about it? I’ll need  to hear back from you by Wednesday. Will that work?” Jake is telling Salima to think about the offer and that he needs to hear back from her by Wednesday. “ To hear back” means to have a response from someone. If I send you an emai l and tell you that I need to hear back from you by Wednesday, that means you nee d to send me a reply to my email by Wednesday – before Wednesday. “Will tha t work?” Jake asks. In other words, “Is that okay?”

Salima says, “Sure, no problem. Just one more thing : I heard that the company has a box at the stadium . . .” A “stadium” is a la rge place where sporting games are played, such as American football or baseball. A “box” is a special place in the stadium, usually up high, that is owned by a ri ch company or person that is sort of like your own little suite, your own little  room, where you can sit and drink and eat and watch the game. You don’t have to sit d own in the main part of the stadium.

If a box is owned by a company, sometimes the emplo yees of the company get to go and use the box – go and see the game. Jake s ays, however, “Let me stop you right there,” meaning “Let me interrupt you.” “ I hope that’s not a deal-breaker, because it’s taken me . . . I mean . . . it takes y ears for employees to get invited.” A “deal-breaker” is something that would make it im possible for two people to reach an agreement, to make a deal. A “deal” (deal)  is an agreement. So, a “deal-breaker” is something that would prevent you from reaching an agreement.

Jake is basically saying here that even if Salima i s hired by the company, it will take years before she will have enough “seniority” – that is, she will have enough experience at the company – to be invited to this b ox. Salima says, “No, not a deal-breaker at all. I’m just a fan” – a fan of wha tever team plays at this stadium.

Jake says, “In that case, it would be a pleasure to  welcome you aboard.” The expression “to welcome someone aboard” (aboard) is usually said when you are on a big boat or a ship. “To go aboard” means to go  onto a ship or some other sort of large transportation vehicle, but it can al so be used metaphorically, as it is here, to welcome someone to a new organization or t o welcome someone to your company.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

# Problems Getting Along With Family

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,101 – Problems Getting Along with Family.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,101. Lots of ones. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from t he Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  Special Courses in Business and Daily English on our website.

This episode is a dialogue between Oscar and Prisci lla about getting along with, or having good relations with, your family. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Oscar: So you’re back from your mother’s birthday d inner. How was it?

Priscilla: Same old, same old. It isn’t a family ga thering without a major meltdown or blowup.

Oscar: Yikes, what happened?

Priscilla: You know how it is. It starts out with b ickering and somebody taking offense at some slight or dig, or bringing up some old grievance.

Oscar: Well, that happens in most families.

Priscilla: Yeah, but in mine, they often turn into screaming matches. We all raise our voices and somebody always storms out.

Oscar: Even at your mother’s birthday dinner?

Priscilla: The occasion doesn’t matter. My mother t ries to be the peacemaker, but it doesn’t take much for tempers to flare.

Oscar: That never happens in my family.

Priscilla: What?! Your family doesn’t fight when it  gets together?

Oscar: No, we try to sweep things under the rug and  put on a brave face.

 Priscilla: What happens when you get mad at each ot her?

Oscar: Nothing.

Priscilla: What do you mean nothing?

Oscar: A lot of our family meals are eaten in stony  silence.

Priscilla: Wow, I think I prefer our knock-down, dr ag-out fights!

[end of dialogue]

Oscar asks Priscilla, “So you’re back from your mot her’s birthday dinner. How was it?” Priscilla says, “Same old, same old.” This  is a phrase used informally to describe something that was unsurprising, or perhap s uninteresting or boring – the same as it has been, and as you expected it to be. Priscilla says, “It isn’t a family gathering,” meaning a meeting of the family,  “without a major meltdown or blowup.”

“Meltdown” (meltdown) here refers to an intense dis play of, or show of, emotion – when someone, especially a child, loses control of his or her emotions and becomes very angry or very sad. Often people who ha ve a meltdown, especially children, scream. They yell in a very loud voice. A  “blowup” (blowup) is when someone becomes very angry very quickly and starts shouting. A blowup is usually related to an argument between two people w here one of them starts yelling or screaming.

Oscar says, “Yikes, what happened?” “Yikes” (yikes)  is an expression of surprise or disapproval. It’s a little old-fashioned, but yo u will still hear people say “yikes.” It’s sort of like saying “wow” or “geez.” So, Oscar  is asking what happened at this family gathering. Priscilla says, “You know how it is,” meaning you understand the situation. “It starts out with bickering and so mebody taking offense at some slight or dig, or bringing up some old grievance.”

Priscilla says, “It starts out with,” meaning it be gins with, “bickering.” “To bicker” (bicker) means to argue, to fight verbally, usually  over things that aren’t very important. “To take offense” (offense) means to bec ome upset by what another person has said or done, usually to you. Someone ma y say something bad to you, something insulting. You might take offense. You might say, “Oh, how could you possibly say that?” and become angry.

Priscilla says that at this family gathering, some member of her family took “offense at some slight (slight) or dig (dig).” A “ slight” is an insult, something you do or say to someone that shows you don’t respect t hem or you don’t like them. A “dig” is a critical remark or statement, often so mething that is made to make the person feel bad, but also to make other people laugh at you.

Priscilla also mentions someone bringing up an “old  grievance.” A “grievance” (grievance) is a complaint that you have about some thing. You’re not happy with something. You think perhaps something is unfair, a nd you remain upset or mad about it. Oscar says, “Well, that happens in most f amilies.” Priscilla says, “Yeah, but in mine, they often turn into screaming matches .” Priscilla is saying that family gatherings, when the family gets together, t hese meetings “often turn into” – or result in, become – “screaming matches.”

“To scream” is to yell very loudly. A “match” (matc h) is a competition, like a game between two people. We talk about “boxing matches,”  where two people basically get into what’s called a “ring” (ring) an d hit each other. Well, this isn’t a boxing match. This is a screaming match, where two people are yelling at each other. It’s not really a competition, of course, bu t we use this expression to refer to a situation when two people are yelling at each other in a loud voice.

Priscilla says, “We all raise our voices and somebo dy always storms out.” “To raise (raise) your voice” means to yell or to shout . “To storm (storm) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to leave the room angrily  – to leave a room indicating to everyone how angry you are. Maybe you close the door very hard behind you. We would say “slam” (slam) the door. Oscar says, “E ven at your mother’s birthday dinner?” Priscilla answers, “The occasion doesn’t matter.” She means it doesn’t matter why the group is getting together, w hy the family is getting together. There are always these arguments.

Priscilla continues, “My mother tries to be the pea cemaker, but it doesn’t take much for tempers to flare.” A “peacemaker” (peacema ker) is a person who tries to end an argument or a fight between two people. A  peacemaker is a person who tries to calm everyone down during an argument or a disagreement. Priscilla says, “It doesn’t take much for tempers to flare.” “Temper” (temper) refers to your emotion, especially anger.

If we say someone has a “bad temper,” we mean that person gets angry very easily. When we’re talking about two or more people , we would use the plural, “tempers,” plus this verb “to flare” (flare). For “ tempers to flare” means for people to become very angry very quickly. The idea of the verb “to flare” means to

appear suddenly, and that’s what happens when peopl e get angry, of course. Sometimes they suddenly start yelling and screaming .

Well, Oscar says, “That never happens in my family. ” Priscilla is surprised. She says, “What?! Your family doesn’t fight when it get s together?” Oscar says, “No, we try to sweep things under the rug and put on a b rave face.” The expression “to sweep (sweep) something under the rug (rug)” me ans to ignore something – to pretend that it didn’t happen or to hide it.

The second expression, “to put on a brave (brave) f ace,” means to pretend to be stronger, braver, and/or calmer than you actually a re. If you’re in a stressful situation or a situation where you might react emot ionally, “putting on a brave face” would be to pretend that you are calm, that y ou are not bothered by the situation. It’s another form of pretending to be so mething that you’re not.

Well, in Oscar’s family, when there are disagreemen ts within the family at a family gathering, people “put on a brave face.” The y don’t get emotional about it, in this case. Priscilla says, “What happens when yo u get mad at each other?” Oscar says, “Nothing.” Priscilla says, “What do you  mean nothing?” Oscar responds, “A lot of our family meals are eaten in s tony silence.” “Stony (stony) silence” would be a period of time when people who are angry with each other don’t talk to each other.

You’ve seen this, I’m sure, and have experienced it . If you go to a restaurant and you see a man and a woman sitting there eating, not  talking to each other the whole time, we would describe that perhaps as a sit uation of “stony silence.” Maybe they’re mad at each other and they don’t want  to talk to each other, although nowadays it’s more likely that you’ll see two people staring at their phones rather than talking to each other, even if t hey’re not mad at each other.

Priscilla says, “Wow, I think I prefer our knock-do wn, drag-out fights!” The expression “knock-down, drag-out” refers to a very serious argument that continues over a long time. Priscilla is saying tha t she prefers her family’s way of dealing with anger, which is to yell at each other,  rather than Oscar’s family’s way of dealing with it, which is simply to stop talking  to each other.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oscar: So you’re back from your mother’s birthday d inner. How was it?

Priscilla: Same old, same old. It isn’t a family ga thering without a major meltdown or blowup.
