This episode is a dialogue between Alan and Katja a bout sicknesses or illnesses that spread very quickly, that affect many people in a short amount of time.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alan:  Did you see today’s news?  There’s been an o utbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.

Katja:  Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease!  I wou ld not want to come down with that.

Alan:  The first outbreak was at the local high sch ool, and the health authorities thought it was localized.  But a second, more wides pread, outbreak has been reported at the city’s government offices.

Katja:  That’s terrible!  I thought Podcaster’s Dis ease was very rare.

Alan:  It is, and that’s why the authorities are so  alarmed.  It’s highly communicable, so they’re hoping it won’t turn into an epidemic, or worse, a pandemic.

Katja:  I’ve heard that this disease is horrible, b ut I’m not sure what the symptoms are.  Do you know?

Alan:  From what I’ve read, sufferers of Podcaster’ s Disease can’t stop talking and they speak in an announcer’s voice all the time .

Katja:  Oh, my God, what a terrible fate!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Alan saying to Katja, “Did  you see today’s news? There’s been an outbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.”  An “outbreak” (outbreak – one word) is the moment when something begins and it starts to affect many people quickly.  Usually, an outbreak is related to some illness or sickness that people are starting to get.  A “disea se” is just another word for an illness, a sickness.  So, this is an imaginary dise ase called Podcaster’s Disease.

Katja says, “Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease!  I would not want to come down with that.”  The expression “to come down with  (something)” means to get a particular illness, to become sick with something .  “I’m coming down with a cold” means that I am starting to get a cold.  “I’m  coming down with the flu” means I’m starting to get the influenza illness – the flu.

“The first outbreak,” Alan says, “was at the local high school, and the health authorities thought it was localized.”  The “health  authorities” would be the government doctors and other important officials wh o make decisions about issues of health in a state or area.  To say someth ing is “localized” means it’s just affecting one small particular area, it doesn’t aff ect things around it.  Because the first outbreak was at the local high school, the lo cal high school kids got sick, they thought it was just there.  “But a second, mor e widespread, outbreak has been reported at the city’s government offices.”  S o there are now two places where people are getting sick.  When we say somethi ng is “widespread” (one word), we mean it covers or affects a very large ar ea.

Katja says, “That’s terrible!  I thought Podcaster’ s Disease was very rare.” Something that is “rare” is unusual, uncommon, not typical.  Alan says, “It is (meaning it is rare), and that’s why the authoritie s are so alarmed.”  “To be alarmed” means to be surprised and worried.  You mi ght be worried about something bad that is happening; you might be “shoc ked,” we would say.  Alan says that this disease is highly communicable.  Whe n we talk about an illness or a disease being “communicable,” we mean that it can  be passed from one person to another or from one animal to another ver y easily.  “Highly communicable diseases” are diseases that can spread  very easily from one person to another.  Another word for this is “conta gious” (contagious).  Alan says that the health authorities are hoping that this di sease won’t turn into – won’t develop into or become – an epidemic.  An “epidemic ” (epidemic) is when many people become sick from a particular disease in a s hort period of time.  An epidemic can affect a large group of people.  A “pa ndemic” (pandemic) is an illness that affects people in many different parts  of the whole world.  So, a

“pandemic” would be a disease that many people suff er in many different countries.

Katja says, “I’ve heard that this disease is horrib le, but I’m not sure what the symptoms are.”  A “symptom” (symptom) is something that is wrong with your body that indicates that there’s a problem.  If you  have a cold, your symptoms might be a sore throat or sneezing a lot.  Katja sa ys, “Do you know (what the symptoms are)?”  Alan says, “From what I’ve read, s ufferers of Podcaster’s Disease can’t stop talking.”  A “sufferer” (suffere r) comes from the verb “to suffer.”  It’s a person who has a disease that feel s pain and discomfort. Sometimes we use the expression “I suffer from….”  “I suffer from allergies.” That means that allergies bother me, they affect me , I have that disease. “Sufferers” are the people who have a disease.  All en says that the sufferers of Podcaster’s Disease can’t stop talking and they spe ak in an announcer’s voice all of the time.  An “announcer” is a person usually wh o presents information, especially on a television or radio program.  The s ports announcer is the person who describes what is happening in the game to the people watching or listening. A news announcer is someone who announces or gives – tells people about the news.  So, Podcaster’s Disease causes people to tal k as if they were announcers all of the time.  An announcer usually has a certai n voice on television.  [In a deep voice] “Hello and welcome to the news.  My nam e is Jeff McQuillan.  In tonight’s top stories….”  That’s kind of an announc er’s voice.  Some people say I talk in an announcer’s voice.  Usually my wife tell s me that sometimes.  Not always, sometimes.  Maybe I have Podcaster’s Diseas e!

Katja says, once again, “Oh, my God.”  “Oh my God” is a very common expression nowadays, especially among young people.   On email or in text messages or instant messages it’s sometimes abbrevi ated “OMG.”  And now, people even talk in abbreviations; someone might ev en say to you, “OMG,” meaning oh, my God.  It’s an expression of shock – of surprise.  It’s become popular in the last, I don’t know, maybe 10 or 15 y ears.  It’s always been an expression in English, but for whatever reason it’s  become more popular among younger people on the Internet.  Some people don’t like the expression; religious people think that you shouldn’t use the name of God  that way.  It is, however, a very common thing that you will hear.

Katja says, “Oh, my God, what a terrible fate!”  “T errible” is very bad, awful, horrible.  “Fate” (fate) is the outcome of a partic ular situation, what happens as a result of a certain situation.  Some people talk ab out “fate” as being what will happen to you that you cannot control.  Some people  believe that there is someone controlling you or some thing controlling y ou, and you can’t avoid it and

you can’t do anything about it; you can’t control it in any way.  This is a very old idea; it goes back at least to the ancient Greeks, who believed in a form of fate.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
