[start of dialogue]  I arrived at the park a little early for our neighborhood baseball game and I needed to kill some time.  I decided to take a walk along one of the trails so I could look at the scenery.  Suddenly, I came across a woman sitting under a tree.   Octavi:  What a beautiful day to be at the park!  Irene:  Oh, hi.  Yes, it’s a nice day, isn’t it?  Octavi:  You look comfortable sitting on the grass in the shade reading.    Irene:  It’s a quiet spot away from the playground.    Octavi:  Do you come here often?  Irene:  Not too often.  I come here every so often on the weekends.    Octavi:  This is a great spot for a picnic.  I saw a lot of people on the other side near the fountain, but this is much more peaceful.    Irene:  Yeah, that’s why I like it here.  Were you looking for the baseball field?  It’s on the other side of the park.
