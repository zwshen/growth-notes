On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e about two people trying to make peace – two countries trying to stop the disag reements between them. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Vladimir: We need a ceasefire. The violence is esca lating and we need to put a stop to this. 

Hilary: I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce? 

Vladimir: They’re as embattled as we are. They may welcome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.  

Hilary: I hate to think what their conditions will be for an armistice. This war has dragged on for so long.  

Vladimir: I suspect they feel the same as we do. If  we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they’ll respond in kind.   

Hilary: Do you really think so? We won’t come off a s weak? 

Vladimir: I don’t think so. We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that. 

Hilary: If you say so. All right, let’s do it. This  war with our neighbors is getting old. Do you want to bring them this fruitcake or sh ould I? 

Vladimir: I’ll take it, but first I’ll make sure th eir ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up. I don’t want to become a casualty while bringing them this peace offering!  

 [end of dialogue] 

Vladimir begins our dialogue by saying to Hilary, “ We need a ceasefire.” A “ceasefire” (ceasefire) is an agreement between two  countries, two nations, or two groups to stop fighting against each other temp orarily, for a little time. Sometimes there’s a ceasefire in order to try to en d the war between two countries or two groups. Sometimes the ceasefire is  for other reasons, but in any case, a ceasefire is when each side, each group, ce ases to fire on the other.  

That’s where we get the noun “ceasefire” – from the  verb “to cease” (cease), which means to stop, and “to fire” (fire) which mea ns to shoot a bullet at someone else from a gun. At least, that’s what it n ormally means in the context of a war. Vladimir says, “We need a cease fire. The vi olence is escalating and we need to put a stop to this.” “Violence” is physical  behavior that is meant to hurt or even kill people, or to damage property, to damage things.  

“To escalate” (escalate) means to quickly or sudden ly increase something in size, value, or even importance. On the Internet no wadays, when you have a problem and you contact the company, if the first p erson you contact isn’t able to help you, sometimes that person will “escalate” you r problem to a supervisor, to one of his or her bosses. So, we use the verb “to e scalate” to mean to either increase something in size, or to increase the impo rtance or to raise the importance of something. In some sort of battle, a conflict or war, “to escalate” would mean to increase the violence.  

And that’s what Vladimir wants to avoid. He wants t o put a stop to the violence. “To put a stop to” something means to end it. Hilar y says, “I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce?” A “truce”  (truce) is an agreement between two people, two groups, or two or more coun tries to stop fighting each other. It’s sort of like a ceasefire. A truce, thou gh, is usually a signed agreement between two groups or two people, even – though nor mally we use it when we’re talking about two countries fighting each other.  

Your “enemy” is the person you’re fighting against.  It’s the opposite of your friend. Not your friend on Facebook – that’s a diff erent thing. Vladimir says that their enemies (and notice that Vladimir and Hilary are “on the same side” – they’re with the same group) “are as embattled as w e are.” “To be embattled” (embattled) means to be involved in a war or prepar ed for a war. The word comes from the noun “battle” (battle) which is a fi ght between two sides – two disagreeing groups or two countries that are fighti ng each other.  

Vladimir says, “They,” meaning the enemy, “may welc ome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.” A “suspension” (suspension) here means a period of time when you stop doing som ething. Here it would be a suspension of “hostilities” (hostilities). “Hostili ties” are angry, possibly violent actions against your enemy. Vladimir says that we c an suspend the hostilities – we can have a “suspension of hostilities until we c an agree on a peace treaty.”  

A “treaty” (treaty) is a written, formal agreement between two or more countries that are in some sort of war or fighting between or  among the countries. So, a “peace treaty” would be a treaty that leads to peac e. After the two great World Wars of the twentieth century, there were peace tre aties among the countries who were fighting. Hilary says, “I hate to think wh at their conditions will be for an armistice.”  

A “condition” is something that you have to agree t o when you sign an agreement. Often in business English we’ll talk abo ut “terms and conditions.” “Terms” refers to the meaning of things in the agre ement, the definition of certain words or phrases in an agreement. “Conditions” are the things that you have to do in order to carry out or in order to be part of the agreement.  

An “armistice” (armistice) is the same as a peace t reaty or a truce. It’s an agreement to stop fighting. For many years in the U nited States, November 11th was celebrated as Armistice Day, in honor of the en d of the fighting in World War I. We changed the name – now we call it “Veterans D ay.” A “veteran” is a man or a woman who has fought in a war. Hilary says, “This  war has dragged on for so long.” “So long” here means very long. “To drag (dr ag) on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to last a very long time.  

Vladimir says, “I suspect they feel the same as we do. If we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they will respond in kind.” A “con ciliatory (conciliatory) gesture (gesture)” is an attempt to make someone feel less angry, to calm someone down, to do something nice for someone with whom yo u have some disagreement or argument. Vladimir thinks that if t hey do that, if they make a conciliatory gesture, their enemies will respond in  kind. “In kind” here means in the same way.  

Hilary says, “Do you really think so? Won’t we come  off as weak?” The expression “to come off as” something means to appe ar in a particular way, to be thought of or perceived in a certain way. Usually, but not always, I think we use this expression when the something that you come of f as is a negative quality. Here it would be coming off as being “weak” (weak),  meaning not strong. That’s  

what Hilary is afraid of – that by making a concili atory gesture, they will come off as weak.  

But Vladimir disagrees, “I don’t think so,” he says . “We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that.” Hilary says, “If you say so.” We use that expression “if you say so” usually when we don’t agree with the ot her person, but we don’t want to continue arguing about it. She then says, “All r ight, let’s do it. This war with our neighbors is getting old.” For something “to get ol d,” in this sense, means to become tiring, to no longer be interesting.  

We learn at this point in the dialogue that we’re n ot talking about two different countries. We’re talking about two different famili es or households that live next to each other. Hilary says, “Do you want to bring t hem this fruitcake or should I?” Hilary is suggesting that they give a little gift t o their neighbors as a conciliatory gesture. One popular gift of food during the Christ mas holidays in the United States is, or used to be, fruitcake. It’s not actua lly a cake. It’s more like a thick bread.  

My mother used to make fruitcake every year so that  we had something to give our teachers. I don’t think they liked it, particul arly. Some people don’t like fruitcake. I love fruitcake because I grew up eatin g it, I guess. Anyway, Vladimir says, “I’ll take it,” meaning I will take the fruit cake to our neighbors, “but first I’ll make sure their ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up.”  

Now we learn the problem between these two neighbor s. The neighbors have a dog who is “mean” – that is, who is not very nice. The dog is also a “barking dog.” “To bark” (bark) is to make a sound like a dog, som ething like [barks]. Well, the barking dog of the neighbors is waking Vladimir up at night. He says he wants to make sure this dog is “tied up,” meaning there’s so me sort of rope around the dog so the dog won’t be able to attack him.  

He says, “I don’t want to become a casualty while b ringing them this peace offering.” A “casualty” (casualty) is a person who was hurt or injured or killed in a war. Here, it means a person who is negatively affe cted by something – in this case, by the dog who might bite him. A “peace offer ing” (offering) is a gift or something you give another person with whom you had  a disagreement. It’s a way of trying to make a conciliatory gesture, a way  of trying to make peace with the other person.  

In the words of John Lennon, “All we are saying, is  give peace a chance.” (You knew I was going to sing that, right?)   

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Vladimir: We need a ceasefire. The violence is esca lating and we need to put a stop to this. 

Hilary: I agree, but do you think our enemies will agree to a truce? 

Vladimir: They’re as embattled as we are. They may welcome a suspension of hostilities until we can agree on a peace treaty.  

Hilary: I hate to think what their conditions will be for an armistice. This war has dragged on for so long.  

Vladimir: I suspect they feel the same as we do. If  we make a conciliatory gesture, I think they’ll respond in kind.   

Hilary: Do you really think so? We won’t come off a s weak? 

Vladimir: I don’t think so. We’re taking the first step to peace. They’ll see that. 

Hilary: If you say so. All right, let’s do it. This  war with our neighbors is getting old. Do you want to bring them this fruitcake or sh ould I? 

Vladimir: I’ll take it, but first I’ll make sure th eir ugly, dirty, mean barking dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night is tied up. I don’t want to become a casualty while bringing them this peace offering!
