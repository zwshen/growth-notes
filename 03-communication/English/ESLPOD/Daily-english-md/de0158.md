# Shopping with My Wife

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 158: Shopping with My Wife.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  158. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, located in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be a story about me going shopping with my wife. Let’s go! > One thing I dread more than anything else is going clothes shopping with my wife. It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy ne w clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense.
> My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” and I always answer with something like: “That’s nice” or “That looks g ood on you.” That usually satisfies her, but sometimes I get harder questions  like, “Which one looks better, this one or the other one?” It’s a hard question to  answer because whichever one I pick, she will follow up with the question I drea d the most: “Why?”
> The truth is, I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’ s because of the color, the cut, the hemline, or the fit. I might have an idea, but I ca n’t put it into words.
> One question I do know the answer to, though, is: “ Do I look fat in this?” The answer to THAT question is always, always, “No!”

In this podcast, you are going with me as we shop f or clothes with my wife. I begin the story by saying that “One thing I dread m ore than anything else is going clothes shopping.” “To dread” (dread) is when  you are not looking forward to something. When you really dislike something, yo u don’t want to do something, but you probably have to do it. For exam ple, “I dread going to work on Monday morning,” means I really don’t want to go  to work, but I know I have to, in this case. Well, I dread more than anything else going clothes shopping – going out to buy clothing with my wife. “It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy new clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense .” Couple of things about that –

those sentences – “it’s not that, It’s just that” –  that construction, that use of those expressions is very common in English. “It’s not th at” means this – what I’m going to say is not true, “It’s just that” – now I’ m going to say something that is true.

So, for example, in the story, I say, “It’s not tha t I don’t like helping her buy clothes” – that means I do like helping her buy clo thes. That isn’t the problem, however. The problem is and then I say, “It’s just that I have no fashion sense.” “It’s just that” is followed by the real reason or the real problem. So, someone may say to you, in a different situation, “It’s not  that Minnesota is very cold in the winter. It’s just that I prefer to spend my time in  Hawaii.” So, you are saying, “Well, the problem with Minnesota isn’t the cold. T he problem is that I prefer to go to Hawaii” – that’s a similar use of that construct ion – “It’s not that. It’s just that.”

Well, in this case, the problem is that I have no “ fashion sense.” “Fashion” (fashion) and “sense” (sense). Well, you know fashi on means the way or the kind of clothing that people wear. We say something is “ in fashion” – that means it’s popular. Many people are dressing that way. A “fash ion sense” is a consciousness, an ability to know what looks good, and what doesn’t look good. So, someone with a fashion sense can say, “Oh. That  color is a good color to wear with this other color.” But someone like me, w ith no fashion sense, could put on green and purple and think, “Oh. That looks okay.” So, I have no fashion sense. And that’s what we mean by “fashion sense” –  someone who knows, the knowledge of knowing which clothes to wear.

My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” And I always answer, “That’s nice,” meaning “Yeah, that’s okay,” or “Tha t looks good on you.” And, of course, “to look good on someone” means that the cl othes look good on them – the clothes are attractive - that the person has a nice look about them in those clothes.

I say in the story that when I tell my wife “That’s  nice,” or “That looks good on you,” “That usually satisfies her.” “To satisfy her ” means she doesn’t ask more questions. She thinks, “Oh. Okay. I accept that.” S he is satisfied. The noun there would be “satisfaction.” Well, my responses usually  satisfy her, but sometimes, I say, “I get harder questions.” Of course, a “hard ( hard) question” is a difficult question. So, I get more difficult – or harder – qu estions when she asks, “Which one looks better, A or B?” And I say, “That’s a har d question because whichever one I pick,” meaning whichever dress, in this case,  I select – A or B – “whichever” one could be either one. Another way of saying “whi chever” is “it doesn’t matter which one I choose.”

For either choice, she will follow up with a questi on I dread the most. “To follow up” – two words – (follow up) – “to follow up” mean s to do something after someone else has done something – that you want mor e information, for example. You can follow up with a question. Sometim es, we use that verb by itself. “I’m going to follow up on our meeting toda y” means I’m going to call you again or email you again about what we talked about  in our meeting. Well, in this case, my wife “follows up with a question” – means after I answer her question, she asks me another question. And the question that  I dread the most – remember “dread” means I hate, I dislike – the most  – is “Why?”

Well, I say in the story that “The truth is, I don’ t know why.” “The truth is” is an expression we use when we are trying to be very hon est with someone else, maybe telling them something that we wouldn’t norma lly tell them. So, for example, my wife says, “Do you want to go over to m y sister’s house?” And I say, “Well, the truth is, I’m really tired.” I’m telling  her something I may not say otherwise, or I can say, “The truth is, I don’t lik e your sister’s dog,” or whatever the reason is. In this case, the real reason I can’ t answer my wife’s question is I don’t know the answer. I don’t know why I like some thing.

I say that “It could be because of the color of the  dress,” for example, the “cut” (cut) of the dress. The “cut” is how it is formed –  what shape it is – that would be the cut of a piece of clothing. When you buy jeans,  for example, blue jeans, you can get them in a “boot” cut (boot). A “boot cut” –  “boot,” of course, is a kind of shoe and a “boot cut” means that the pants fit very  straight on your leg. They’re cut very straight. You could also get a wide-cut, o r a loose cut – whatever kind of cut it is, it’s the shape of the clothing. The “hem line” (hemline) – all one word – is the bottom of the dress, in this case. It’s where the dress ends – that would be the “hemline.” So, when people talk about dresses a nd skirts that women wear, they may talk about how the hemline has been going up – means the skirts have been getting shorter. The “hemline” is the bottom w here the skirt or where the dress ends.

I say that “I don’t know if it’s because of the cut , the hemline, or the fit” (fit). The “fit” means how well something looks on you – if it ’s tight. Is it too loose? Is it too tight? – these are always talking about the fit. If  it’s just perfect, we say, “That’s a perfect fit.” It’s not too tight, not too loose.

Well, I end my story by saying that there is one qu estion that I always know the answer to. And it is always the same answer. If my wife says, “Do I look fat in this?” meaning does this piece of clothing make me look like I am fat? the answer to that - and if you are a man, you know the answer  to this question. It is always “No.” – doesn’t matter what the dress is; it’s alwa ys “No.” If you don’t know the

answer to that question then you’re probably not ma rried or don’t have a girlfriend.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

One thing I dread more than anything else is going clothes shopping with my wife. It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy ne w clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense.

My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” and I always answer with something like: “That’s nice” or “That looks g ood on you.” That usually satisfies her but sometimes I get harder questions like, “Which one looks better, this one or the other one?” It’s a hard question to  answer because whichever one I pick, she will follow up with the question I drea d the most: “Why?”

The truth is, I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’ s because of the color, the cut, the hemline, or the fit. I might have an idea, but I ca n’t put it into words.

One question I do know the answer to, though, is: “ Do I look fat in this?” The answer to THAT question is always, always, “No!”
