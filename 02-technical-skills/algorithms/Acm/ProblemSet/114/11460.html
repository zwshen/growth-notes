<h2>Problem E: Balance</h2>

A sailboat has many forces acting on it. This allows it to sail
in many different directions, even if the wind is not blowing
in the desired direction. In order for the boat to be easily
controlled, however, certain forces must be balanced.
<p>
Suppose the wind is blowing from the north and the boat is
facing west. Above the water, the blowing wind hits the sails,
and because of the way that they are angled, pushes the boat
to the southwest. The keel extends deep below the water.
The water resistance on the keel creates a counterforce
pushing the boat northward. Ideally, the northward force 
on the keel will counteract the southward component of the
force on the sails, so that the boat will move to the west.
<p>
A problem can arise if the centre of the sails (called the Centre of
Effort, or CE) is not directly above the centre of the keel (called the Centre
of Lateral Resistance, or CLR). In general, the boat can pivot about the centre
of the keel. If the sails are too far forward of the keel, the wind
will push the bow (the front) of the boat southwards, and the boat will
turn towards the south. If the sails are too far aft of (behind) the
keel, the wind will push the stern (the back) southwards, and the boat
will turn towards the north. Ideally, the sails and keel are balanced so
that the boat sails in a straight line.
<p>
In this problem, you will examine a side view of the boat to determine
whether the CE is above the CLR. The CE is defined as the centroid
of the part of the boat above the waterline. The CLR is defined as
the centroid of the part of the boat below the waterline.
The centroid of a polygon is the point whose coordinates are
the means of the corresponding coordinates of all points inside the polygon.
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>
The first line is the number of test cases to follow. The test cases follow,
one after another; the format of each test case is the following:<p>

The first line of input will contain a single integer n specifying the
number of points along the outline of the side view of the boat.
The following n lines will each contain two integers: the x
and y coordinate of a point along the outline. The points will be
given in order along the outline. The x axis (i.e.
the line y = 0) represents the waterline. Assume that the
boat faces in the direction of increasing x coordinates.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
1
7
0 1
2 3
4 1
4 -3
2 -3
2 -1
0 -1
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
If the CE is forward of the CLR, print the line:
<p>
<tt>CE is forward of CLR by N units.</tt>
<p>
If the CE is aft of (behind) the CLR, print the line:
<p>
<tt>CE is aft of CLR by N units.</tt>
<p>
In both cases, replace the <tt>N</tt> with the
difference in the x coordinates of the CE and CLR
to two decimal places.
If the x coordinates of the CE and CLR are equal, print the line:
<p>
<tt>Balanced.</tt>

<h3>Output for Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
CE is aft of CLR by 0.50 units.
