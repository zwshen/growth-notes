# Good Hygiene

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 254: Good Hygiene.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 254.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com; we have some new things on our website.  Of course, we have the Learning Guide, and eight to ten page guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.  Our dialogue today is called “Good Hygiene,” and it's about keeping clean so that you don't get sick.  Let's listen.  > Juanita:  Hey, where have you been?  I was going to invite you to lunch, but you weren’t at your desk.  Bill:  I was at a training.  Juanita:  What was it on?  Bill:  Office hygiene.  Juanita:  Hygiene?  You’re kidding.  Your office is pretty messy but I wouldn’t say you needed hygiene training.  Bill:  Very funny.  Each department has to go through it.  You’ll have your turn next week.  Apparently, the management wants to reduce the spread of illnesses around the office.  They say that people are taking too many sick days and it’s bad for productivity.  Juanita:  So, we all have to sit through a training.  What a pain!  It’s not like we don’t know how to wash our hands.  Bill:  Yeah, I know.  The trainer did a pretty good job, though, explaining how germs spread around the office.  It’s easy to infect other people when you have a cold or something else that’s contagious.  She said that viruses get around pretty easily.  She gave us some pointers on how to prevent it, though.
