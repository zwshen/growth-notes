<h2>Problem J: Installing Diagnostic Software</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11751.gif" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>You have recently been appointed as the administrator for a wired
network of devices. Unfortunately, your predecessor used very poor
quality lines to connect the devices. The board of executives is
currently deciding if they want to fund an upgrade to a wireless
network, or simply replace the existing wires with ones of better
quality. As expected, this decision is being weighed down with
bureaucratic nonsense; it looks like it will take some time before
anything is approved.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you still have to deal with the problem at hand. You have
access to an antiquated version of Newton Network Monitor which is a
software package that, once installed on a machine, will monitor all
lines connected to that machine and immediately alert the user when a
line has failed. This should help reduce your response time to any
failures.
</p>
<p>Your task is to install the software on some machines so each line
is being monitored by at least one of its endpoint devices. For various
technical reasons, the time it takes to install the software varies
from device to device so you want to minimize the total amount of time
spent installing the software. You cannot install on more than one
machine at a time (since you only have one copy of the software)
meaning the total time spent installing the software is exactly the sum
of the installation times on each machine. </p>
<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>Each input case begins with two numbers n,m with 1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000 and 0
≤ m ≤ 25,000. Following this are m pairs of distinct integers between 0
and n-1 which describe a wire connecting the two devices. The time
spent installing the software on machine numbered i is 2<sup>i</sup>.  The input is terminated with n = m = 0; this should not be processed. 
</p>
<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>For each input case, there is to be one line of output containing a
sequence of n bits with no spaces. The i'th bit is 1 if the software is
installed on machine i, and 0 if not.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>

0 2
1 2
3 1
1 2
0 0

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
