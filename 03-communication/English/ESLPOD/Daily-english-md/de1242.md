This episode is a dialogue between Derrick and Liz about having to agree with other people. It’s not easy, as we’ll learn. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Derrick: That does it. I give up!

Liz: Don’t lose heart. We’ll come to a consensus so oner or later.

Derrick: No, we won’t. We’re hopelessly deadlocked.

Liz: It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we  only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.

Derrick: The trouble is, everybody seems to have ma de up their minds and they’re beginning to dig in their heels.

Liz: Before they do, let’s take one more vote. Mayb e somebody has changed their mind.

Derrick: I doubt it. Nobody wants to be outvoted so  both sides are trying to maintain the status quo. They’d rather be deadlocke d than on the losing side.

Liz: But if we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll have  to come back tomorrow and continue our discussions and deliberations.

Derrick: You’re right! I can’t spend another day in  this room. I’ve held out long enough.

Liz: What do you mean?

Derrick: The only way I’m getting out of here is to  change sides!

Derrick begins our dialogue by saying to Liz, “That  does it. I give up!” The expression “That does (does) it” is used when you a re angry and frustrated and you don’t want to put up with, or accept, or tolera te something any longer. If your neighbor’s dog is barking, making a lot of noise, y ou may decide after an hour that you don’t want to tolerate or accept that nois e any more. So you say, “That does it. I’m going over to my neighbor’s house to t ell the owner of that dog to keep him quiet.”

Derrick says, “That does it. I give up!” The phrasa l verb “to give up” means to stop trying to do something, usually because it is too difficult. Liz, however, says, “Don’t lose heart.” “To lose (lose) heart (heart)” means to begin to think that something is impossible and that you should stop tr ying, in effect, that you should give up. “To lose heart” means, we could also say, “to be discouraged” – to feel as though you will not succeed at something.

Liz is telling Derrick not to give up, not to lose heart. “To lose heart” is a psychological or mental condition, if you will. “To  give up” is an action – to stop doing something. “To lose heart” is to become disco uraged, to think that you will not be successful. Liz says, “We’ll come to a conse nsus sooner or later.” A “consensus” (consensus) means an agreement, a situa tion in which most people in a group agree on something. So, obviously the si tuation here is that Derrick and Liz are in a meeting and not everyone agrees on  what to do.

Liz thinks that the people in the meeting will even tually “come to a consensus.” Notice the use of the verb “to come to” a consensus . We might also say “to reach” a consensus. Derrick says, “No, we won’t. We ’re hopelessly deadlocked.” “To be deadlocked” (deadlocked) means when people h ave very strong opinions on two sides of an issue – I think one thing, you t hink another – and they can’t agree on something. They can’t come to an agreement .

This happens sometimes with the government and gove rnment unions, or a big business and the workers for that business. They ma y become “deadlocked.” “To be hopelessly (hopelessly) deadlocked” means you ha ve no chance of agreeing. “Hopelessly” means that there is no hope. There is no possibility of changing the situation.

Liz says, “It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.” “To be evenly split” (split) means that you

have the same number on both sides of the issue or argument. So, if you have a group of six people, three people say one thing, th ree people say something else. They’re evenly split. “To change your mind” ( mind) means to change your opinion – to say, “Well, I think I was wrong. I thi nk this is correct instead.”

Liz thinks only one person has to change his or her  mind in order “to break the tie.” A “tie” (tie) is the same as being evenly spl it – when in a group you have the same number of people saying yes and no. “To break (break) a tie” means that you are no longer evenly split. One person may chan ge his mind and that would break the tie. There would be, that is, a “majority ” – more than 50 percent of people who say one thing.

Derrick doesn’t agree. He says, “The trouble is,” m eaning the problem here is, “everybody seems to have made up their minds and th ey’re beginning to dig in their heels.” There are two important expressions i n that sentence. The first one is “to make up your mind.” “To make up your mind” m eans to reach a decision after having thought about something for a while. “ To make up your mind” also usually means that you are certain about something,  meaning you probably won’t change your mind in the future.

That’s why Derrick uses the second expression, “to dig (dig) in your heels (heels).” “To dig” as a verb usually means to take something and put it in the ground in order to remove dirt or some other substa nce. We use a “shovel” (shovel) to dig a hole in the ground. You move the dirt from one place so that you have a hole, a depression, a space that goes down i n the ground. That’s “to dig.”

Your “heels” are the back part of your feet. If you  are wearing shoes, the “heels” of the shoes are the back parts of the shoes that a re on the ground underneath the back part of your foot, which we call the “heel .” So, if we put these two things together, “to dig in your heels” means literally to  take the backs of your feet and to create a small hole in the ground with them. How ever, we use this expression as a way of saying “to be very stubborn” – to refus e to change your opinion, to refuse to change your mind.

You can sort of see the connection. If you are, for  example, pulling on a rope and one person is pulling in one direction and you’re p ulling in the opposite direction, you would naturally try to use your heels to dig in  the ground to prevent your body from moving forward. That is more or less what  the meaning of this expression is. It means to be stubborn, not to chan ge your mind.

Liz says, however, that before people begin to dig in their heels, she wants to “take one more vote” (vote). “To vote” is when peop le indicate how they think

about a certain matter or what their opinion is abo ut a certain issue. She says, “Maybe somebody has changed their mind” – that is, maybe someone has changed his or her mind. Derrick says, “I doubt it. ” He doesn’t think anyone has changed his mind.

He says, “Nobody wants to be outvoted.” “To be outv oted” (outvoted) is to lose a vote because one side has more votes than you do. D errick thinks nobody wants to be outvoted, “so both sides,” both groups of peo ple, “are trying to maintain the status quo.” The “status (status) quo (quo)” refers  to the way things are now. “Status quo” is a Latin expression, and it refers t o the current situation, the way things are right now without changing anything.

Derrick thinks people “are trying to maintain the s tatus quo,” meaning they don’t want to change anything. He says instead “they’d ra ther be deadlocked than on the losing side.” In other words, they would rather  not have an agreement than lose the vote, than to be on the losing side – the losing group, if you will – in the vote.

Liz says, “But if we don’t reach an agreement” – if  we don’t come to a consensus – “we’ll have to come back,” or return, “tomorrow a nd continue our discussions and deliberations.” “Deliberations” (deliberation) means usually a careful, slow, detailed consideration of something. We talk about a group of people who are deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent of a  crime – we call that group a “jury” (jury) – “deliberating” – that is, they’re m aking their decision carefully and slowly and by thinking and talking a lot about it.

Derrick says, “You’re right! I can’t spend another day in this room. I’ve held out long enough.” “To hold out” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to continue to hold your position or to continue to have a certain  opinion even when the situation is difficult or the situation is dangerou s. “To hold out” means to stay where you are or to keep your opinion even though i t is difficult.

Derrick says, “I’ve held out long enough.” Liz says , “What do you mean?” Derrick says, “The only way I’m getting out of here is to c hange sides!” “To change sides” (sides) means to change your opinion and join the o ther group – in this case, to join the group with whom you previously disagreed. So, Derrick is going to change his mind and change his vote so that the gro up is no longer deadlocked, so that they reach a consensus.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Derrick: That does it. I give up!

Liz: Don’t lose heart. We’ll come to a consensus so oner or later.

Derrick: No, we won’t. We’re hopelessly deadlocked.

Liz: It’s true we’re evenly split right now, but we  only need one person to change their mind to break the tie.

Derrick: The trouble is, everybody seems to have ma de up their minds and they’re beginning to dig in their heels.

Liz: Before they do, let’s take one more vote. Mayb e somebody has changed their mind.

Derrick: I doubt it. Nobody wants to be outvoted so  both sides are trying to maintain the status quo. They’d rather be deadlocke d than on the losing side.

Liz: But if we don’t reach an agreement, we’ll have  to come back tomorrow and continue our discussions and deliberations.

Derrick: You’re right! I can’t spend another day in  this room. I’ve held out long enough.

Liz: What do you mean?

Derrick: The only way I’m getting out of here is to  change sides!
