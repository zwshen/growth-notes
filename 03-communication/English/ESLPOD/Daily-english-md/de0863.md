[start of dialog]

Toshi:  You can’t go outside looking like that!  Wh at are you thinking?

Celeste:  I’m exercising my right of free speech.  I’ve put on these clothes and painted my body this way to protest the treatment o f women.  I want to send a message.

Toshi:  You’re crazy if you think people are going to take you seriously.  What you’re wearing is offensive and those messages pain ted on your body are hate speech.

Celeste:  It’s my basic human right to a freedom of  expression, and this is how I choose to express myself.

Toshi:  There are limits to free speech and express ion, and you’ve crossed the line.  In fact, you’re abusing those rights.  Obsce nity and hate speech aren’t protected, you know.

Celeste:  If you feel so strongly about it, I have a suggestion for you.

Toshi:  What?

Celeste:  You can express your free speech by prote sting against me.  After all, it’s your inalienable right.

Toshi:  I’m not wasting my time.  Hey, you’re not r eally going outside looking like that, are you?

Celeste:  You know what they say:  The medium is th emessage.  And I’m sending my message loud and clear!

Our dialog begins with Toshi saying to Celeste, “Yo u can’t go outside looking like that! What are you thinking?” We’re not sure what C eleste looks like but Toshi doesn’t like it. Celeste says, “I’m exercising my r ight of free speech.” “To exercise” (exercise) here means to use, usually to use your abilities or your rights or your privileges to do something. The verb “to ex ercise” is often used with the word “right” or “”rights” in referring to your abil ity to do things that you are legally allowed to do.

“The right of free speech” is the legally protected  ability that you have to give your opinion, to express your ideas in public. Of c ourse, that’s not always true in every situation. In general, that’s the meaning of the term “free speech” – the ability to say what you want. “Free” here doesn’t m ean the opposite of “expensive” or having to pay for it. It means that you have the freedom that you are allowed to say what you want. That’s what we me an by “free speech.”

Celeste says, “I’ve put on these clothes and painte d my body” – put colored paint on her body – “this way to protest the treatment of  women.” “To protest” (protest) means to fight against something, to express your d isagreement of something, usually in public. Celeste says, “I want to send a message,” meaning I want to communicate my opinion, my ideas to someone else -  in this case, to people who see her at this protest that I guess she’s goin g to.

Toshi says, “You’re crazy if you think people are g oing to take you seriously.” “You’re crazy” means that you have lost your mind, that you are not thinking properly. “You’re crazy if you think people are goi ng to take you seriously,” Toshi says. “To take someone seriously” means to consider  what another person is doing or saying, and thinking that it’s a serious m essage. You don’t think that they’re silly or stupid or foolish. “To take someth ing seriously” can also mean to treat it as though it is an important thing, not ju st to ignore it or to think, “Oh, that’s not important.”

Toshi says, “What you’re wearing is offensive and t hose messages painted on your body are hate speech.” If something is “offens ive” (offensive) it’s something that is insulting. It hurts other people’s feelings . It might be rude. It might make

other people mad or upset. All of those things coul d be considered “offensive.” “Hate speech” is a relatively new idea that words t hat express very bad, negative things about other people because of certain charac teristics they have, should somehow be treated differently than other opinions.  So, there’s “free speech,” which is the freedom to say what you want. Now peop le, some people, talk about “hate speech,” which are things that you should not  be allowed to say because they are so offensive to other people.

Celeste says, “It’s my basic human right to freedom  of expression.” The term “human right” refers to something that everyone sho uld be allowed to do, no matter where you are, where you live, what governme nt you have. That would be a human right. Not everyone agrees on what those ri ghts are, but most people believe that there are things such as human rights that everyone should have. Celeste believes that one of her “basic” – one of h er fundamental, one of her most importan – human rights is “freedom of express ion.” “Freedom of expression” is just another word for freedom of spe ech.  “This is how I choose to express myself.” “Expression” can actually mean a l ittle bit more than just speech, in the sense of “words.” “Expression” might  also include your actions or, in this case, how you dress – or don’t dress.

Toshi says, “There are limits” – there are restrict ions – “to free speech and expression, and you’ve crossed the line.” The phras e “to cross the line” means to go too far, to go beyond what you are allowed to do  or what you should do. Toshi says, “In fact, you’re abusing those rights.” “To a buse” (abuse) means to use something for the wrong purpose, perhaps, to use to o much of something or to hurt someone in some way that you do not have the r ight to do, that you should not do. Toshi thinks that Celeste is abusing her ri ght of free speech.

He says, “Obscenity and hate speech aren’t protecte d you know?” “Obscenity” (obscenity) refers to words, images, or actions tha t are considered very rude, very offensive, especially when it refers to sex or  sexuality. “Obscenity” is one of those things that is very difficult to define. Ther e has been a debate in the United States for many years about what obscenity is. One of the famous quotes from the Supreme Court – one of the justices on the Supr eme Court – about what obscenity is and how to define it, was, “I know it when I see it.” In other words, he couldn’t give a definition of obscenity but he knew  what obscenity was when he saw it. A lot of people were not very happy with th at definition but that’s what he said.

“Obscenity and hate speech,” Toshi says, “aren’t pr otected.” “Protected” means that the law allows you to do something – that the law prevents you from being punished because of your actions, in this case, you r speech. Toshi says that

“Obscenity and hate speech aren’t protected,” meani ng you’re not allowed to do that and call it free speech. Celeste says, “If you  feel so strongly about it” – if you have such a strong opinion about it – “I have a sug gestion for you.” Toshi says, “What?” Celeste says, “You can express your free sp eech by protesting against me. After all, it’s your inalienable right.”

“Inalienable” (inalienable) is something that canno t be taken away from a person. The word was famously used in the Declaration of In dependence, written by Thomas Jefferson, saying that the American colonies  were no longer going to be part of Great Britain, that the colonists – the peo ple who lived in the American colonies – had “inalienable rights,” rights that Gr eat Britain could not take away from them. Jefferson named three – life, liberty (o r freedom), and the pursuit of happiness – the right to be able to find things tha t make you happy.

Toshi says, “I’m not wasting my time. Hey, you’re n ot really going outside looking like that, are you?” Celeste says, “You know what t hey say: The medium is the message. And I’m sending my message loud and clear. ” The phrase “the medium is the message” was used famously by the Can adian writer and philosopher Marshall McLuhan back in the 1960’s to mean that the way that a message is delivered affects its meaning, that a me ssage changes depending on how the message is communicated, how it is delivere d. That’s a very simple explanation of what McLuhan was talking about. Cele ste says, “The medium is the message,” meaning I’m going to send a message b y the way I’m dressed. She says she’s sending her message “loud and clear. ” “Loud and clear” means everyone can understand it. There’s nothing hidden.  It’s easy to understand.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.
