This episode is a dialogue between Danny and Lisett e about different times that you work throughout the day. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Lisette:  You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t y ou?

Danny:  Yeah, it’s my first day.

Lisette:  I’m Lisette.

Danny:  I’m Danny. Nice to meet you.

Lisette:  You’re lucky to be starting on the day sh ift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to work the graveyard shif t for two years before I got the day shift.

Danny:  I guess I am lucky, but I wouldn’t mind wor king any shift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed. My wife and I are e xpecting our first child and we need to save up.

Lisette:  Oh, yeah? Congratulations! Well, there are always people who want time off and need someone to cover for them. You ca n usually pick up extra hours and shifts that way. Sometimes, there’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.

Danny:  I can understand that. Well, if you ever ne ed anybody to cover for you, just give me a shout.

Lisette:  All right, I’ll keep it in mind. Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.

[end of the dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Lisette saying to Danny,  “You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t you?” “The new kid on the block” (blo ck) here means a new person in an organization. Usually, in American cities, we  call the place where the houses or the apartments are in between the streets  “blocks.” “One block,” one rectangle that has four streets – one on the north,  one on the south, one on the east and one on the west – well, that’s a block. An d if you say you’re the “new kid on the block” that means usually your family has ju st moved to that particular area and the other kids may say, “You’re the new ki d here.” You’re the one that has arrived most recently.

Here we’re talking about a work organization, not a n actual city block. Danny says, “Yeah, it’s my first day.” Lisette says, “I’m  Lisette.” Danny says, “I’m Danny, nice to meet you.” Hmm, maybe we have something going here between Lisette and Danny, let’s see. Lisette says, “You’re lucky t o be starting on the day shift.” A “shift” (shift) is the period of time during the 24 -hour day that you work. The “day shift” would be the period of time between, say, 8 or 9 in the morning and 4 or 5 in the afternoon – that would be in places that hav e workers there all 24 hours – in other words, a hospital, maybe certain factories  that make things that operate 24 hours a day. Well, you can’t work 24 hours a day  so you divide the day up into 3 shifts. The day shift, then there’s the second sh ift, which is usually from 4 or 5 in the afternoon until midnight or so, and then you  have what we’ll find out in a second is the “graveyard shift.”

Lisette says to Danny, “You’re lucky to be starting  on the day shift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to wo rk the graveyard shift for two years before I got the day shift.” “Umpteen” (umpte en) is an unusual word in English but you will hear it in conversation. It me ans a lot or many. The idea is that there are so many years you can’t count them. Often, it’s an expression or a word used by people who are getting older and can’t  remember or don’t want to remember how many years ago it was. I graduated fro m high school “umpteen” years ago – many, many, many, many, many years ago.  Lisette says she started working at this company umpteen years ago – many ye ars ago – and when she did, she had to work the “graveyard” shift. A “grav eyard” – one word - is a place where you bury bodies. It’s a place where you put d ead people - a “cemetery,” we could also call it. But in the expression “grave yard shift” – it refers to people who have to work from midnight to say, 8 or 9 o’clo ck in the morning – the people who have to work at night, after usually midnight o r 1 AM – we call this the

“graveyard shift.” Why? Well, I guess because peopl e have this idea that the dead are fans of the nighttime, that bodies walk du ring the night – I don’t know, that’s just what we call it.

Danny says, “I guess I am lucky. But I wouldn’t min d working any shift even double shifts.” “To work a double shift” means to w ork 16 hours – to work 2 shifts. The day shift and the second shift – the first shif t and the second shift, for example. Danny says, “I wouldn’t mind working any s hift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed.” “To get up to speed” means  to learn something quickly – once you’re able to do what you are supposed to do.  So, you’re learning some new skills, some new thing you have to do at your w ork. It may take you a day, a week, a month to really be able to do it as well as  you should, as well as everyone else. You need to get up to speed – to be moving fast enough, if you will.

“My wife and I are expecting our first child,” Dann y says – so, I guess there’s no relationship between Danny and Lisette – “and we ne ed to save up.” “To save up” is a phrasal verb that means to save money, usu ally for some particular purpose. “I’m saving up for a car.” “I’m saving up for a new computer.” “I’m saving up for a new electric guitar so I can be in a rock band” – yeah, that will be cool. “So, I’m saving up for something.”

And Danny and his wife, who is expecting her first child – when we say “they’re expecting” we mean she is going to have the baby, s he’s pregnant – Danny needs to save up. Lisette says, “Oh, yeah? Congratu lations!” Now, of course, Lisette must be a little disappointed to find out t hat Danny is already married but she doesn’t seem to indicate that in the dialogue. Lisette says, “Congratulations! Well, there are always people who want time off and  need someone to cover for them.” “Time off” are hours or days when you don’t work your normal schedule. So, normally you work Monday through Friday, but yo u’re going to take some time off. We use the verb “to take” – with time off . You’re going to take some time off on Friday or on Monday. You’re not going to wor k all or part of that day. Lisette says that “there are always people,” meanin g there will always be someone who wants to take time off and need someone  to “cover for them.” “To cover (cover) for someone” means to work when anoth er person cannot. So, someone says, “I can’t work this afternoon” – altho ugh I am scheduled, I’m supposed to – “Could you cover for me?” “Could you work during the time that I’m supposed to work?”

Lisette says, ”You can usually pick up extra hours and the shifts that way.” “To pick up” here is a phrasal verb meaning to get some thing in addition to what you

would normally have. Normally you work 8 hours but you can pick up an extra four hours by working half a shift, four hours of t he second shift, for someone who wants time off. “Sometimes,” Lisette says, “the re’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.” “Overtime” (overti me) – one word – is when you work at a job where you are paid by the hour and yo u work more than your normal number of hours for that week – usually in t he U.S it’s forty hours. So, if you get paid by the hour, you make $20 an hour or $ 40 an hour or whatever it is, and you work your 40 hours and then the boss wants you to work “overtime” – you’re working more than your regular 40 hours. And  in the U.S and most places, you get paid extra. So, you might get paid, instead  of your normal $20 an hour, you might get paid $25 or $30. Sometimes, companies  will pay what’s called “double time.” They’ll pay you twice as much as you  normally work if you work overtime – more than your normal 40 hours. This is only for people who are paid by the hour. If you get a “salary” – if you are pai d a certain amount every year, then typically, you don’t get overtime. You may wor k 60 -70 hours a week but you are not going to get paid extra. But overtime is wh en you are paid extra for an hourly position.

Lisette says that the veteran workers – the workers  who have a lot of experience – who have been here a long time. “The veteran work ers get first dibs.” “To get first dibs” means that you are the first person or in the group that gets to decide or choose something before anyone else. So, if the company says, “We’re going to offer 10 hours overtime this week,” first they w ill ask the veteran employees – the employees who have been there a long time. “Do you want it?” And they say “No.” And then they go to the next group and then t he next group. “To get first dibs” means to get first choice. It’s an expression  that we use sometimes. It’s often something that you would say as a child. Let’ s say there’s a piece of chocolate cake or a large chocolate cake with sever al pieces and somebody says, “I get first dibs,” meaning I get to choose m y piece before the rest of you. But adults can also say this.

Danny says, “I can understand that. Well, if you ev er need anyone to cover for you,” he says to Lisette, “Just give me a shout.” T he expression “to give someone a shout” (shout) means to call someone or t o contact them. Usually it means to call them on the telephone. It’s an inform al expression. You wouldn’t use it in a formal setting, but among friends or co -workers – people you work with – it’s okay. It’s probably an expression that would  become less common. Now, instead of giving someone a shout, you would probab ly send them a text. Informally, we might use the verb “shoot” – “to sho ot someone a text or an email,” “send me an email” or “shoot me an email” –  that would mean the same thing – contact me.

Lisette says, “Alright, okay. I’ll keep it in mind”  – I’ll remember that. “Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.” She’s helpin g Danny by giving him extra hours so he can save up for “diapers” (diapers). “D iapers” are things that you put around a baby – around their bottom – so that they can go to the bathroom because, of course, babies can’t walk and go to the  bathroom by themselves. I don’t have a lot of experience changing diapers. I was the youngest in my family. I know my older brothers and sisters do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
