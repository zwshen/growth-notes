This episode is called “Having an Overbearing Father.”  S omeone who is “overbearing” is very controlling.  This is a dialogue be tween a father and his daughter, and you’re going to see how the father trie s to control his daughter.  He thinks it’s normal, she thinks it’s too much.  Let’s get star ted. 

[start of dialogue] 

Dad:  Where are you going? 

Eva:  Out. 

Dad:  Out where? 

Eva:  Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman.  You don’t need be so overbearing.  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.   

Dad:  As long as you live under my roof, you’ll live by my rules.  Now, where are you going? 

Eva:  I’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.  I’ ll be home before curfew. 

Dad:  I don’t like that guy, Damien.  He’s not good en ough for you.  He’s a troublemaker.  Mark my words: That kid is going nowhere fast.  Is this a date? 

Eva:  No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.   

Dad:  Alone?  With no supervision?  What is this world co ming to?  

 Eva:  Dad, we’re not kids anymore.  We’re both 17.   

Dad:  That’s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.   

Eva:  What are you doing? 

Dad:  I’m putting on my coat. 

Eva:  Why? 

Dad:  You and Damien need a chaperon. 

Eva:  No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s wit h you tagging along as our chaperon.  That would be humiliating. 

Dad:  Good, then you’ll stay home.  So, what movie shou ld we watch tonight? 

Eva:  Huh!

The dialogue begins with the father saying, “Where are  you going?”  Eva says, “Out.”  This is a typical thing that a teenager or young  adult might say; they don’t want to tell the father exactly where they’re going so they say, “Oh, I’m just going out,” meaning I’m leaving the house, but you don’t tel l them where you’re going. So, the father says, “Out where?”  Eva says, “Dad, I’m nea rly (I’m almost) a grown woman.”  “Grown,” here, means an adult, no lon ger a child.  We might also say “grown up.”  She’s a grown woman.  “Grown,” ho wever, has even more meanings in English; those can be found in our Learning  Guide. 

Eva says to her father, “You don’t need be so overbearing .”  “Overbearing” is when you are very controlling, you have very strong opinion s about things, you try to control what other people do.  You could be an overbearing husband, an overbearing wife, an overbearing mother-in-law; all o f these are possible – not in my case, of course!   

Well, Eva says, “You don’t need to be so overbearing (Da d).  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.”  “To give (so meone) the third degree” (degree) means to ask someone many questions, often about things that the person doesn’t want to tell you.  So if you say, “Oh, I’m  going out,” and someone  

 says to you, “Where are you going?” and you say, “I’m goin g to the store,” and they say “Which store?” and you say, “I’m going to the gro cery store,” and they say “What are you going to buy there?”  They keep asking you  more and more questions; that’s to give someone the third degree.  Yo u might wonder why we use this expression: “the third degree,” you might not wo nder.  But if you do wonder, I’ll tell you.  “Degree” is sometimes used in English as a way of classifying something at different levels.  If you accidental ly put your hand in fire and burn it you might get a first degree burn, if it ’s more serious a second degree burn, and if it’s really bad a third degree burn.  We ll, there was an organization – there still is – called the Masons, it’s sort of a secret organization for men.  It has been around for many centuries.  Here in the United St ates, in order to become a Mason you have to go through different levels, and the final level is called the Third Degree, and it requires that you be asked a bunch of questions – a lot of questions.  That’s the origin, that’s where the expression  comes from.  In the early 20th century, the police would ask people who they thought committed a crime – who did something against the law – a series of questions.  They would “interrogate” them, which means to ask many questions of so meone you think is a criminal.  That’s what Eva is referring to here.   

The father says, “As long as you live under my roof (that is, in my home.  Your ‘roof’ is the top of the house, so if you live in it you  are under the roof), you’ll live by my rules.”  “To live by” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning you will follow certain rules or certain ideas.  We might also say you wi ll “comply (comply) with” these rules.  This is something a parent might say: “if you live under my roof, you live by my rules.”  My parents certainly believe that.   

The father says, “Now, where are you going?”  Eva says, “I ’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.”  Damien is a friend.  “T o hang out” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend time with someone having fun, no t doing anything in particular, maybe talking, watching television, etc.  It’s an informal expression: “to hang out.”  Eva says, “I’ll be home before curfew.”  “Cu rfew” (curfew) is, for children and young adults, the time when you must be back home every night; it’s the latest time that you can be outside of the house .  So if you have a 15- year-old daughter, you might say to her, “Your curfew i s nine p.m.”  That means you must be back here at nine o’clock, that’s your rule.  T he government can also have curfews when there is a lot of violence.  Many cities h ave curfews for those who are under the age of 18.  So even if the parent doesn’t have a curfew, the government will sometimes have a curfew for teenagers. 

Eva says she’ll be home before curfew.  Dad says, “I don’t like that guy, Damien. He’s not good enough for you.”  “To be not good enoug h” means that they are  

 not as good as someone or something else; we might say the y’re “inferior,” they’re less than your level.  Dad says, “He’s a troublemaker .”  A “troublemaker” (one word) is a person who creates many problems, someone who is always causing trouble: a “troublemaker.”  Dad then says, “Mar k my words.”  The expression “mark my words” is used to indicate to the person  listening to you that you are going to say something important.  Usually, you a re making a prediction; you are making a guess as to what will happen in the fu ture.  You might say, “Mark my words.  Someday, a woman will become President  of the United States.”  You’re making a prediction.  The father is ma king a prediction that Damien is “going nowhere fast.”  This is kind of an odd expression.  “To go nowhere” means that you’re not progressing – you’re not  moving from where you are.  How is it possible to go nowhere fast since you’re n ot moving?  Well, it isn’t. But the expression means that you are a person who will never be successful, or this idea is a losing idea.  So Damien is not going to be successful; he’s a loser.   

Dad says, “Is this a date (are you going to Damien’s house on a date)?”  Eva says, “No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.”  The father says, “Alone? With no supervision?”  “Supervision” is when someone is wat ching you to make sure that you are following the rules.  In this case, it  would be an adult such as a parent.  The father says, “What is this world coming to? ”  This is an old expression.  “What is this world coming to?” is used to sho w how upset you are, how angry you are about how things are changing over ti me.  You’re saying that things used to be better in the past, but now everything  is changing; the world is changing for the worse: “What is this world coming to?”   

Eva says, “Dad, we’re not kids anymore,” meaning we don’t need supervision. She says, “We’re both 17 (17 years old).”  Dad says, “That’ s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.”  The father means that  that’s an age where you could do a lot things wrong, and therefore you do need  supervision.  Eva says, “What are you doing?”  The father says, “I’m putting on  my coat (my jacket to go outside).”  Eva says, “Why?”  The father says, “You and Dami en need a chaperon.”  A “chaperon” (chaperon) is a person, usuall y an older person who stays with two other people, usually a man and a woman or a boy and a girl, to make sure that they don’t do anything wrong, especially wh en they are on a romantic date that they don’t do things that the pare nt, in this case, would not want them to do.  A “chaperon” can also be just for a single person, say a young woman who was traveling.  This is not common today, but many years ago a young woman traveling by herself might need a chaperon,  someone such as an older sister, a mother, an aunt that would go with th em to keep them out of trouble.  So, the father is going to be the chaperon for this date.  Do American  

 parents still insist their children have chaperons on thei r dates when they are in high school?  I would say probably not. 

Eva says, “No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s wi th you tagging along as our chaperon.”  “To tag (tag – some would pronounce  it ‘tag,’ but I’m from Minnesota so I pronounce it ‘tag’) along” is a two-wor d phrasal verb meaning to go somewhere with someone, especially when that person d oes not want you to go with them.  Your younger brother may tag along wi th you to go to the movies; you don’t really want your younger brother to go with yo u.  Well, Eva doesn’t want her father to be tagging along on her date.  S he says, “That would be humiliating.”  Something that is “humiliating” is ve ry embarrassing, very uncomfortable, something that makes you feel uncomforta ble, even “ashamed” (ashamed), where you feel bad about what you have done . 

Dad says, however, “Good, then you’ll stay home (you won’t leave).  So, what movie should we watch tonight?” the father asks the daug hter since she is now not going to go over to Damien’s house.  The daughter,  of course, is very upset, and she just says, “Huh!”  She’s upset; she doesn’t want to talk to the father anymore.  Was the father being overbearing, unreasonabl e?  Well, I guess that depends on the kind of parent you are. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Eva:  Out.

Eva:  Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman.  You don’t need be so overbearing.  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.
