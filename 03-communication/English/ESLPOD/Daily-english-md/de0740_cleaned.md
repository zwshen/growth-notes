This episode is called “Corporate Gift-Giving.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Michelle:  Why did I get stuck with buying corporate gifts for our clients this year?  Just because I’m a woman doesn’t mean I’m good at buying gifts.  Rafiq:  It’s not because you’re a woman.  It’s because you’re the most junior employee of the company.  I had the job three years ago when I started working here.  Michelle:  Oh, so you know the drill.  I was thinking of sending food baskets to McQ Corp.    Rafiq:  I wouldn’t advise doing that.  We’re bidding on a new contract with their company and the gift could be misconstrued as a bribe.  You’ll want to avoid any appearance of impropriety.  Michelle:  Then I shouldn’t send anything at all?    Rafiq:  You could send a charitable donation in the company’s name.  This way, we show our appreciation for their business, and they get recognition for the contribution to a worthy cause, without seeming like we’re trying to influence their decision.  Michelle:  That seems like a good way to go.  What about the other companies we’re doing business with?
