This episode is a dialogue between Ali and Mariela abo ut describing weather that has a lot of wind or where there are storms, where t here is rain and clouds, that sort of thing.  It will use a lot of vocabulary related  to the weather.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ali:  It’s just our luck that as soon as we arrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!

Mariela:  It’s uncanny, isn’t it?  On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with a tornado and now this.

Ali:  Yeah, that tornado was something.  I had experie nced windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but it was nothing li ke that tornado.  Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors, and even wa lls rattled?  The tornado blew down power lines and uprooted trees!

Mariela:  That was terrifying.  Do you think we’ll have  another experience like that this time?

Ali:  I really hope not.  We came for ocean breezes, bu t if the hurricane makes landfall, we’ll have gale winds of up to 50 miles per hour!

Mariela:  And we’re trapped here!  What should we d o?

Ali:  We’ll just buckle down and wait it out.  With an y luck, the hurricane will miss the island altogether.

 Mariela:  With our luck, what’s the likelihood of that  happening?!

Ali begins by saying, “It’s just our luck that as soon as we a rrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!”  The expre ssion “it’s just our luck” or “it’s just my luck” is a phrase we use when you are comp laining about having bad luck, using it to introduce an example of how bad you r luck is.  For example: “It’s just my luck that when I got to the store – to the  grocery store, there were no more bananas.”  I wanted to buy some bananas, but they d idn’t have any, that was just my luck.

Ali says that it’s just their luck that as soon as they arrive  for their island vacation there’s a hurricane warning.  An “island” is land surro unded on all sides by water. An “island vacation” is where you would go for a relaxing , warm vacation, Hawaii for example, or the Caribbean.  If you are living in t he United States those are two popular places to go on an island vacation.  Unfortu nately, on this island there is a hurricane warning.  A “hurricane” is a large  storm that forms over the ocean – it begins over the ocean, and it has very strong a nd dangerous winds. Here in the United States a few years ago, we experien ced Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed a large part of the city of New Orleans in the state of Louisiana in the south central part of the U.S.  Hurricanes are given names; they used to always be names of women, but a few years ago they changed  so that sometimes it’s a woman’s name, sometimes it’s a man’s name.   They alternate – they change: first a man, then a woman, then a man, th en a woman.  Not sure there’s been a Hurricane Jeff; I think that would be go od to have!

Mariela says, “It’s uncanny, isn’t it?”  Something that is “uncanny” is something that is very difficult to explain or understand, somethi ng that is very unusual or not common.  “It’s uncanny that I always meet my friend at  a local café,” even though we weren’t planning on seeing each other we ru n into each other, we would say, we meet each other unexpectedly.  I can’t expla in it – it’s uncanny. Mariela says, “On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with  a tornado and now this.”  “To cross paths with (something or someone)” means to meet that thing or that person, to be in the same place at the same time with that person.  “I crossed paths today with my old high school science teacher,” I happened to be in the store while she was in the store.  That’s “to cro ss paths with.”

Ali and Mariela crossed pass with a tornado.  A “tornad o” is a dangerous storm that forms over land and has very strong and dangerous wi nds that blow in a circle.  Tornadoes are storms that start over the land; h urricanes are storms that

 start over the sea – over the ocean.  Here in the Unit ed States, in the central – the mid-central and the midwestern part, tornadoes are quite common.  When I grew up in Minnesota, we would often see tornadoes and  there would be tornado warnings.  They would tell people to go down into the ir basements to protect themselves because these strong storms were coming through – these tornadoes.

Ali says, “Yeah, that tornado was something,” meaning th at was really amazing, in a good way or a bad way.  Ali says, “I had experienced  windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but nothing like that torna do.”  A “windstorm” is a storm with very strong wind, though not as serious or as str ong as a tornado. When you have a windstorm, you have very strong gusts of w ind.  A “gust” (gust) is a sudden, strong movement of air.  It could be very qui et, and then suddenly you get this strong wind; that’s a “gust” of wind.

Ali has experienced really strong gusts of wind, but nothi ng like the tornado.  He says, “Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors,  and even walls rattled?”  “To rattle” means to make noise when somethi ng is being blown by the wind or something is moving against another object.  Whe n we have earthquakes here in Southern California, we had one just a few w eeks ago, if it’s very strong, the cups on the table will rattle.  They’ll make a noise  because the table is moving and the cup is on top of it, or the dish or what ever happens to be there.

Ali says, “The tornado blew down power lines and uproot ed trees!”  “To blow down” means that a strong wind makes something fall over .  “The tornado blew down the trees,” meaning the trees fell down because t he wind was so strong. The word “blow” has several different meanings in Engl ish, attached to different prepositions; take a look at our Learning Guide for som e additional explanations of that phrasal expression – that phrasal verb.

These winds also uprooted trees.  “To uproot a tree or  a plant” means that it takes it out of the ground so that the bottom of the p lant that is below the ground, what we call the “roots,” can be seen.  A very powerful storm could lift the tree out of the ground, that’s how strong it is.  That’s “up rooting” the tree.

Mariela says, “That was terrifying.  Do you think we’ll ha ve another experience like that this time?”  Ali says, “I really hope not.  We came for ocean breezes, but if the hurricane makes landfall, we’ll have gale winds of up to 50 miles per hour!” A “breeze” is a very soft, gentle wind, something that’s ve ry nice.  It’s a soft breeze – it’s a soft wind.  “Breeze” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English however, so once again, take a look at our Learning Gui de for some additional explanations.

 The hurricane, however, will not just have light breeze s, but if it makes landfall they’ll have gale force, or gale winds.  When we say a hu rricane “makes landfall,” we mean that the storm, which remember begins over the ocean – over the sea, comes onto the land; it arrives at the land.  A “gale” is a very strong wind associated with hurricanes.

Mariela says, “we’re trapped here!  What should we do?”  meaning we can’t get out.  Ali says, “We’ll just buckle down and wait it out.  With any luck, the hurricane will miss the island altogether.”  “To buckle d own” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stay in one place, usually while  you’re waiting for something else to happen.  “To wait (something) out” means to wait for something to finish or to end, especially something like a storm or bad weather, or simply a bad situation: “I’m going to wait it out u ntil our boss resigns and we get a new boss.”

Ali says that with any luck, if they are lucky, the hurricane will miss the island “altogether,” meaning completely, totally, entirely – “ altogether.”  Mariela says, “With our luck, what’s the likelihood of that happenin g?!” meaning we have such bad luck.  With our luck, what’s the likelihood (what’s the chance; the probability) that that will happen.  Not very likely, since Ali and M ariela seem to have very bad luck!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Ali:  It’s just our luck that as soon as we arrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!

Mariela:  It’s uncanny, isn’t it?  On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with a tornado and now this.
