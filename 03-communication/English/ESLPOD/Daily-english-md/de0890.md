This episode is a dialogue between Charles and Rach el about going out and enjoying the world outside of your home, outside of  any building, enjoying nature. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Charles:  This is what I call the great outdoors.  Look at that stunning view!

Rachel:  This is truly jaw-dropping.  We’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world where wildlife lives in  its natural habitat.

Charles: It’s almost like living in the middle of t he wilderness, isn’t it? I bet those ponds and forests have amazing biodiversity.

Rachel:  It is beautiful, and it’s great to be away  from all of the pollution of the city.  I’ve never seen foliage like this.  This is truly a majestic landscape.

Charles:  You really can’t appreciate the outdoors until you come to a place like this.

Rachel:  You’re right.  I feel like I’m at one with  nature here.

Charles:  Should we leave the hotel and go for a wa lk?

Rachel:  A walk?  Why?  We have the best view of na ture right here.  We don’t want to spoil the effect by getting too close.

Charles begins our dialogue by saying to Rachel, “T his is what I call the great outdoors.” The phrase “the great outdoors” refers t o the beauty of the natural world – mountains, and rivers, and flowers – and ev erything that's natural out in

the world that you can go see – the ocean, trees, f orests – all of these things are part of what you could call “the great outdoors,” m eaning the wonderful world of nature. Charles says, “Look at that stunning view.”  “Stunning” (stunning) means very impressive, very beautiful. A “view” refers to  the things you can see when you look in a certain direction. Some people who li ve near the ocean have a view of the ocean. They can look out of their window and  see the ocean. Charles is talking about a stunning, or amazingly beautiful vi ew.

Rachel agrees. She says, “This is truly jaw-droppin g.” The term “jaw-dropping,” used as an adjective here, means very surprising, v ery shocking but in a good way – something that is really good, really beautif ul. Your “jaw” (jaw) is the lower part of your face. It's what you move up and down w hen you talk, and when you eat your food. That whole thing is called your jaw.  “To drop” means to go down quickly. “Jaw-dropping” would be when your jaw drop s down and your mouth is open. That's the expression that we have on our fac e when we see something very surprising or very amazing. That's why we have  this term “jaw-dropping” to describe something that is amazing. Rachel says, “W e’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world.” “Pristine” ( pristine) means perfect, just like new – something that hasn't been touched, something  that hasn't been altered or changed in any way.

Rachel says they’re in one of the most pristine are as of the world where wildlife lives in its natural habitat. “Wildlife” (wildlife)  – one word – refers normally to the animals that live in nature, not your dog or your c at in your house, but bears and moose and, I don't know, wolves, that live out away  from any human area, away from any area where the humans live. That would be wildlife. “Wildlife” is any animal that doesn't live inside of a house or insid e of a cage. Rachel says this is an area where wildlife lives in its natural habitat . The “natural habitat” (habitat) is the area where a certain kind of animal normally li ves or a certain kind of plant normally grows. This again would be, typically, an area where there aren't any humans or very few humans, and so the animals and t he plants live and die as they would normally do, without any humans interfer ing, or any humans getting involved.

Charles says, “It's almost like living in the middl e of the wilderness, isn't it?” “Wilderness” (wilderness) is a large area of land t hat doesn't have a lot of humans in it. It doesn't have a lot of buildings or  a lot of roads. That would be “wilderness.” Large parts of the state of Alaska he re in the United States could be described as wilderness. They’re areas where no hum ans have ever even gone or at least that we know of. Charles says, “This is  like living in the middle of the wilderness.” He says, “I bet those ponds and forest s have amazing biodiversity.” A “pond” (pond) is a small lake. “Forests” are area s where there are a lot of trees.

“Biodiversity” refers to the variety, the different  kinds of life in a certain area. It might be different kinds of plants. It might be dif ferent kinds of animals. Typically it's both of those things. That's what “biodiversit y” refers to. “To be diverse” means to be different, to have a lot of different t ypes. “Biodiversity,” then refers to a lot of different types of life.

Rachel says, “It is beautiful and it's great to be away from all of the pollution of the city.” “Pollution” (pollution) refers to someth ing that is dirty, something that is harmful perhaps even something that is poisonous. W hen we talk about pollution here in Los Angeles, we're usually referring to air  pollution, where you look in a distance towards downtown and you see this sort of brown air. That would be pollution. We have a lot of it here in Los Angeles.  It's the part of the city that isn't so beautiful. Rachel then says, “I've never seen fo liage like this.” “Foliage” (foliage) are the leaves of trees and other plants.  That's foliage. “This is truly a majestic landscape.” “Majestic” (majestic) refers t o something that is very beautiful, very lovely, very impressive. “Landscape ” is the same as scenery. It's the things that you can see in a distance, usually when there aren't a lot of buildings or houses that are blocking your view. Yo u can see out onto the land. That would be the “landscape.” Charles says, “You c an't really appreciate” – you can't really understand and enjoy – “the outdoors u ntil you come to a place like this.” Rachel says, “You're right. I feel like I'm at one with nature.” “To be at one with something” means that you feel connected to it . You feel united with that thing or that idea or that group of people, even. I n this case, Rachel feels at one with nature – with the natural environment, the nat ural world. Charles says, “Should we leave the hotel and go for a walk?” That , of course, is the funny part of the dialog. We imagine, in the first part of the  dialogue that they're out somewhere by a lake, or in the mountains, or in a f orest but instead they're still in their hotel. Charles says, “Should we leave the hot el and go for a walk?” Rachel says, “A walk? Why? We have the best view of nature  right here. We don't want to spoil the effect by getting too close.” “To spoi l (spoil) the effect (effect)” means to change or to ruin some perception or illusion th at you have, to change the way you are thinking about something in such a way that  it would be worse, that it would be not as good. That would be “to spoil the e ffect.”

Rachel says, “We don't want to spoil the effect” – the effect of this beautiful nature – “by getting too close” – by actually leavi ng their hotel and going out into the nature that they are looking at through their w indow. That’s kind of my view of enjoying nature. I like to enjoy nature from my hot el room, from my car maybe. An airplane would also be a place I could enjoy nat ure from. I’m not so much interested in going out into the actual nature itse lf. Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed
