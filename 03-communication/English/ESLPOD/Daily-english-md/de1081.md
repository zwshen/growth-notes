This episode is a dialogue between Giorgio and Anna . Giorgio and Anna are talking about personal grooming – things you do to keep yourself clean and good-looking. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giorgio: I’ll pick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?

Anna: You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get  ready.

Giorgio: You just need to go home, take a shower, a nd throw on some clothes. How much time do you need?

Anna: You have no idea what a woman has to do to lo ok her best, do you? Not only do I have to bathe, I need to exfoliate and de pilate.

Giorgio: “Depilate”?! What’s that?

Anna: That’s shaving and waxing to you. I have to s have and wax my legs, my armpits, and bikini area.

Giorgio: Whoa! That’s way too much information. I d idn’t need to know that.

Anna: After that, I’ll need my nail clippers, nail file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.

Giorgio: I don’t even want to know what you pluck.

 Anna: Just my eyebrows and my . . .

Giorgio: Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and out s of your personal grooming. Is all that really necessary?

Anna: You are going to introduce me to your brother , aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?

Giorgio: I was until I heard all that. I don’t know  if I want my brother dating a woman who’s so high-maintenance.

Anna: High-maintenance? High-maintenance?! Who are you calling high- maintenance?

Giorgio: And high-strung!

Giorgio begins our dialogue by asking Anna, “I’ll p ick you up tonight at 7:00, okay?” “To pick someone up” means usually to drive to their house and to take them somewhere in a car. Anna says, “You’d better make it 8:00. I need time to get ready.”

Giorgio says, “You just need to go home, take a sho wer, and throw on some clothes.” Giorgio says that it shouldn’t take Anna long to get ready to go. She just needs to “take a shower” – to wash herself – and to  “throw on,” or put on, some clothes. “Throw on” is a phrasal verb used informal ly the same way we would use the phrasal verb “to put on” when we’re referring t o clothes. Giorgio says, “How much time do you need?”

Anna says, “You have no idea what a woman has to do  to look her best, do you?” I don’t, either. Anna says, “Not only do I ha ve to bathe, I need to exfoliate and depilate.” Anna is complaining that Giorgio, be ing a man, doesn’t understand all the things that a woman has to do, and quite ho nestly, I as a man don’t understand them either, but I’ll try to explain as best I can.

Anna starts by talking about bathing, and that’s the one thing I do understand. “To bathe” (bathe) means to wash yourself, either i n a shower or in the bathtub. “Exfoliate” (exfoliate) means to remove the dead sk in cells from the surface of your skin, usually by rubbing your skin with either  a rough, tough substance or

using some sort of chemical. This is something I’ve  never done, and I don’t know how it’s done, but I am told by women, including my  wife, that it is in fact done.

Something else women apparently do is “depilate.” N ow, I’m so unfamiliar with this concept that I actually had to look up the pro nunciation of that word. Absolutely true. Anyway “depilate” (depilate) is wh en you remove hair from your body. Now I understand why I didn’t know the meanin g of it – and neither does Giorgio, because he says, “‘Depilate’?! What’s that ?” Exactly right, Giorgio.

Anna says, “That’s shaving and waxing to you.” “To shave” (shave) is something I do understand, because men – many men – shave the ir faces. I shave my face every couple of days when I’m not feeling too lazy.  “Waxing” (waxing) is removing hairs from your body by putting on a hot, sticky substance called “wax.” Wax is what we usually make candles out of. It soun ds very painful. I’m told it is very painful, and it’s not something that most men would probably do, but apparently some women do this.

She says, “I have to shave and wax my legs, my armp its, and bikini area.” Well, I understand shaving and waxing your legs, but appare ntly Anna also has to do that to her armpits. Your “armpits” (armpits) are t he areas below your shoulder, between where your arms come into your body and the  main part of your body – the torso or center part of your body.

Most people have hair under their arms in their arm pits. I know I do. But Anna is going to remove that hair, which is again something  apparently women do. Anna also needs to do something with the “bikini area.” A “bikini” (bikini) is a kind of swimsuit that is in two pieces that a woman wears. One piece covers the top – her breasts. The other piece covers the bottom. The  things that you don’t want other people to see, let’s say.

So Giorgio says, “Whoa! That’s way too much informa tion.” “Too much information” means you’re telling someone things th at are too personal, that they don’t need to know. We abbreviate this now in Engli sh “TMI.” If someone is giving you information about their personal life th at you don’t want to know or don’t think you should know, you might say “TMI,” e specially if it’s something that is embarrassing to either you or to the person. Gio rgio, in fact, says, “I didn’t need to know that.” But Anna continues.

She says, “After that, I need my nail clippers, nai l file, and tweezers to do my nails and my plucking.” Your “nails” are the parts of your hand and foot that are on the very ends of your fingers and your toes – the hard substances that grow out of the ends of your fingers and toes. Those are  your “nails” (nails). So, a “nail

clipper” would be something that cuts your nail. the verb “to clip” (clip) means to cut. A “nail file” (file) is a small tool, usually a flat little stick that is rubbed against the nails in order to make them smooth after you cu t them, I guess.

“Tweezers” (tweezers) are small instruments that lo ok like little pliers – like scissors, sort of, but they don’t cut things. They are used to grab onto something that’s very small and remove it. If, for example, y ou pick up a piece of wood and the wood is rough, you might get a little piece of the wood in the skin of your finger. To remove that little piece of wood – what we would call a “sliver” (sliver) – you would use a very small tool called the “tweezer s.” Well, that’s what Anna is using.

Now, why is she using the tweezers? Well, apparentl y in order to do her “plucking” (plucking). “Plucking” comes from the ve rb “to pluck” (pluck), which means to pull out hair from your body, usually usin g a tweezers. Once again, it sounds rather painful. Giorgio, upon hearing this, says what I think most men would say: “I don’t even want to know what you pluc k” (what kind of hairs you’re pulling out).

But Anna tells him – “Just my eyebrows and my . . . ” “Eyebrows” (eyebrows) are the thin rows of hair that grow above your eyes. Wo men sometimes pluck the hairs out of their eyebrows, I’m told, in order to make them look better. This is not something that most men do. I certainly would not d o that. I cut my eyebrows sometimes, but I don’t pluck them. Once again, I’m not used to that kind of pain the way women are, I guess.

Giorgio doesn’t want to know what other hairs Anna plucks. He tells her “Stop! I don’t need to know the ins and outs of your persona l grooming.” The expression “the ins (ins) and outs (outs)” refers to the detai led information about something, the specific information about something. In this c ase, it’s the ins and outs of personal grooming. “Grooming” (grooming) comes from  the verb “to groom,” which means to take care of something in terms of t he physical cleanliness and appearance of it.

So, “personal grooming” would be taking care of you rself – washing yourself, cutting your hair, shaving, and so forth. All the c razy things that women do. Anna says, “You are going to introduce me to your brothe r, aren’t you? Your very handsome brother?” Anna is explaining why she needs  to do all of this personal grooming. It is apparently because Giorgio is going  to introduce her to Giorgio’s brother. “To introduce someone” to someone else mea ns to take someone and have them meet someone that you know.

So, if you have a new girlfriend and you decide to introduce your girlfriend to your parents, you take your girlfriend home with you and  you let your parents meet your girlfriend. That’s usually considered somewhat  of a serious step in a relationship, when you meet the parents – when you meet the parents of your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Well, Giorgio has a b rother who Anna thinks is very handsome, very good-looking. Giorgio says, “I was,”  meaning I was going to introduce you to my brother, “until I heard all tha t,” meaning until I heard about all the things that you do in doing your personal groom ing.

Giorgio says, “I don’t know if I want my brother da ting” – going out romantically with – “a woman who is so high-maintenance.” The ex pression “high- maintenance” (maintenance) is used to describe some thing that requires a lot of work. It’s often used in a negative way to describe  a woman who is very demanding, who requires a lot of attention. I’m not  sure if that’s what Giorgio is referring to here. He does think that Anna takes an  awful long time in order to get ready, and perhaps that’s why he thinks she’s high- maintenance.

Anna considers this an insult, a negative thing to say about her. She says, “High- maintenance? High-maintenance? Who are you calling high-maintenance?” She’s very upset. Giorgio, however, doesn’t apologi ze. Instead, he says, insultingly, “And high-strung!” Someone who’s “high -strung” (strung) is someone who is easily upset, someone who gets mad at the sm allest little thing, or someone who’s just very nervous and very tense (ten se) – someone who’s always very worried, perhaps.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Our scriptwriter understands all the ins and outs of the English language. I speak, of course, of the wonderful, not high-maintenance D r. Lucy Tse.
