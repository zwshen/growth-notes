On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Carl and Shelly about someone who’s had some bad luck and is trying to re cover. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Come on, let’s go. I have $500 burning a hole  in my pocket.

Shelly: Where are we going?

Carl: We’re going to the track. I have a tip on a s ure thing for one of this afternoon’s races. This is exactly what I need afte r last week’s setback.

Shelly: You mean after losing all of your money las t week.

Carl: Right, but all I need to do is to get that mo nkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune. Winning big this aftern oon will be the start of a new winning streak.

Shelly: Maybe what happened last week is really a s ign of things to come. Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.

Carl: Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity. I ’ve always believed that when you meet with a setback, come back with all you’ve got.

Shelly: Does that mean what I think it means?

Carl: Yes, that’s right. I’m plunking down all $500  on that race. I can’t lose.

Shelly: But what if –

 Carl: Don’t say another word. When I win and get ba ck in my stride, you can say, “Congratulations!”

[end of dialogue]

Carl begins our dialogue by saying, “Come on, let’s  go. I have $500 burning a hole in my pocket.” “Come on” means “Let’s move. Le t’s leave” – in this case, “Let’s go.” Carl and Shelly are going somewhere. It  seems as though they’re going to gamble to try to win money by doing some s ort of gambling. Carl says he has “$500 burning a hole in his pocket.” “To hav e money burning a hole (hole) in your pocket (pocket)” means to have some money t hat you want to spend and spend quickly, especially if it’s cash – if it’s pa per money or coins.

Literally, your “pocket” is where you keep your key s and your money in your pants. Most pairs of pants have at least two pocket s, one on each side. You’ll often have pockets in the back of the pants – to pu t a wallet, for example – at least, most men’s pants have a pocket in the back. “To burn a hole in your pocket” would mean that the money in your pocket wo uld fall out. It would fall out through the hole that was burned by the money. It’s  just an expression that we use when we have some money and we really want to g o out and spend it, often spend it on things that aren’t very important or th ings that are just for fun.

Shelly says, “Where are we going?” Carl says, “We’r e going to the track.” The “track” (track) here means the racetrack, a place w here horses or dogs run around an oval-shaped path. You could also have a t rack for runners. In the Olympics, for example, there are races that go arou nd the track. It’s like a large circle, but in the shape of an oval. Carl wants to go to the racetrack to bet money so he can win more money.

Carl says, “I have a tip on a sure thing for one of  this afternoon’s races.” A “tip” (tip) here means some secret information that was g iven him that would give him some advantage in, in this case, winning money at t he racetrack. Perhaps somebody who knows the horse or knows the person ri ding the horse – we call that person a “jockey” – gave this information to C arl. A “sure thing” is something you know will definitely happen. It’s guaranteed. I t doesn’t involve any risk. It will 100 percent, for certain happen. Carl thinks that t his horse – or dog, we’re not sure which – will definitely win the race, and so b y betting on that horse or dog, Carl is sure that he will win.

“Races” are competitions – in this case, a race wit h different animals. Carl says, “This is exactly what I need after last week’s setb ack.” A “setback” (setback) is

when you’re having good luck, or things are going w ell for you, and then suddenly something bad happens – something happens that delays or slows your progress. But you know it’s only temporary. Yo u’re not worried about it.

A setback is a small, typically temporary problem t hat you think will go away, and in the very near future you will continue to be suc cessful. That term is also sometimes used when someone is sick, especially in a hospital or with some illness or disease that lasts a long time. Someone may be getting better, and then they have a setback. They stopped getting bett er. They get a little worse.

Shelly says, “You mean after losing all of your mon ey last week?” Carl’s setback was that he lost all of his money, at least all of the money he was gambling. Carl says, “Right,” meaning yes. “But all I need to do i s to get that monkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune.” The expr ession “to have a monkey (monkey) on your back” means that you have a seriou s problem that lasts a long time and is very difficult to resolve, or solve. “T o have a monkey on your back” is to have a problem that lasts for a long time. It is  been with you for a long time. Carl says that he has a monkey on his back, and so he wants to get the monkey off his back. “To have a monkey on your back” is to  have a problem. “To get a monkey off your back” is to get rid of the problem.

Carl says if this happens – if he can get rid of th is bad luck, basically – he’ll have a “reversal of fortune.” “Fortune” (fortune) means something very good, often a lot of money. We talk about someone “making a fortu ne in the stock market” – we mean this person made a lot of money in the stock m arket. A “reversal” (reversal) is when something changes, something changes comple tely, so that instead of winning, you are losing – or, instead of losing, yo u are winning. That would be a reversal. A “reversal of fortune” would be a change  in your luck – suddenly, things are going well for you instead of poorly for  you.

Carl thinks his luck is going to change. He says, “ Winning big” – meaning winning a lot of money – “this afternoon will be the start of a new winning streak.” A “streak” (streak) is a series of things that happen  one after the other. “To have a winning streak” means to be winning each and every competition that you enter. If a baseball team has a winning streak, they are w inning every game, maybe 5 games “in a row (row),” we would say. When somethin g happens consecutively, one after the other, we use the expression “in a ro w.” So, a winning streak might be winning 5 games in a row, or 10 games in a row.

Carl thinks that if he wins big this afternoon, he will be starting a new winning streak. Shelly says, “Maybe what happened last week  is really a sign of things to come.” The expression “a sign (sign) of things to c ome” means that what has

happened in the past will be the same thing that wi ll happen in the future; it will give you an idea about what will happen in the futu re. The fact that Carl lost in the past, according to Shelly, may be a sign of thi ngs to come – that he will continue losing, not that he will have a reversal o f fortune. Shelly says, “Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.” Just as you can win several games in a row, or several competitions, so you can lose several games  or competitions in a row, and that’s what Shelly is saying here.

Carl says, “Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativ ity.” “To jinx” (jinx) someone means to bring bad luck to someone – to do somethin g or say something that will cause problems for other people. People who are sup erstitious, or who believe in bad luck, worry about other people jinxing their pr ojects – somehow causing them to have bad luck by something that they say, u sually something negative. And that’s why Carl says, “Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity.” “Negativity” is the idea of being pessimistic, of thinking that things will go poorly in the future.

Carl says, “I’ve always believed that when you meet  with a setback” – when you have some difficulty – “come back with all you’ve g ot,” meaning you should respond with all of your energy, with full effort. Shelly says, “Does that mean what I think it means?” Carl says, “Yes, that’s rig ht. I’m plunking down all $500 on that race.” “To plunk (plunk) down” means to spend a lot of money on something. “I’m going to plunk down $500 on a new iPad.” Well,  I’m not, but that’s an example. “I’m going to plunk down a thousand dollar s to buy my beautiful wife a new ring.” I’m not going to do that, either.

Carl says, “I can’t lose.” Shelly says, “But what i f?” and then Carl interrupts her. Carl says, “Don’t say another word. When I win and get back in my stride, you can say ‘Congratulations.’” “To get back in your st ride” or “into your stride” (stride) means to return to doing something well af ter a period of not doing it well – to start having success after you’ve had several failures. Carl thinks he’s going to win at the racetrack today and doesn’t want Shel ly to bring him any bad luck.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Come on, let’s go. I have $500 burning a hole  in my pocket.

Shelly: Where are we going?

Carl: We’re going to the track. I have a tip on a s ure thing for one of this afternoon’s races. This is exactly what I need afte r last week’s setback.

 Shelly: You mean after losing all of your money las t week.

Carl: Right, but all I need to do is to get that mo nkey off my back and then I’ll have a reversal of fortune. Winning big this aftern oon will be the start of a new winning streak.

Shelly: Maybe what happened last week is really a s ign of things to come. Maybe it was the start of a losing streak.

Carl: Don’t jinx me with that kind of negativity. I ’ve always believed that when you meet with a setback, come back with all you’ve got.

Shelly: Does that mean what I think it means?
