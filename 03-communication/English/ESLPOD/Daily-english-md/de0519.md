This is dialogue about family relations.  It’s going to use a lot of vocabulary you might use in talking about the way members of your famil y get along, or don’t get along.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Eri:  What’s that?

James:  It’s an invitation to a family reunion.  Once ever y five years or so, someone in the family organizes one.

Eri:  Are you going?

James:  I’m not sure.  It’s always a little awkward seeing extended family.  Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my fa ther and his brother?

Eri:  No, what happened?

James:  I’m not sure, but it was something that happened  before they got married.  My father held a grudge for years.  Then, a bout eight years ago, they made up.  There’s still no love lost between their wives,  but at least there are no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.

Eri:  So you’ll go to the reunion?

James:  I’m not sure.  My mother’s side of the family has a lways looked down on my father’s.  She comes from old money and they didn’t ap prove of her marrying

 my father.  It was really hard on my mother.  She reall y looked up to her mother and they were really close before my father came along.

Eri:  But that’s ancient history, isn’t it?  Considering how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it against your mother for marr ying your father.

James:  You’ve never met my grandmother.  One thing everyo ne knows about her is this: She doesn’t know the words to forgive and f orget.

Our dialogue begins with Eri saying, “What’s that?”  Jam es says, “It’s an invitation to a family reunion.”  A “reunion” is when people who used to be together come together again.  After you graduate fro m high school, usually 10 or 20 years after the year you graduate they have a high scho ol reunion, where everyone gets together again.  I’ve never gone to my hig h school reunion, probably never will.  “Family reunion” is when you get t ogether with members of your family, usually cousins, people who perhaps live in a different part of the country even, might travel to a family reunion.  When I was growing up, we had family reunions that we went to usually in the summertim e.  But, of course, just my own family, what we would call my “immediate family,”  had more than 40 people, so didn’t really need the cousins to have a big p arty.

James says, “Once every five years or so, someone in the famil y organizes a family reunion.”  So his friend asks, “Are you going?”  Ja mes says, “I’m not sure. It’s always a little awkward (a little strange) seeing e xtended family.”  “Extended family” are family that are not in your what we call – and what I just called – “immediate family.”  Your immediate family is your fath er, your mother, your brothers, your sisters, their husbands and wives, and prob ably their children – your nieces and nephews.  Your extended family could includ e your grandparents, your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, and so  forth.  Everybody has a slightly different definition of what is “immedi ate” and what is “extended” in terms of family.

James says, “Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my father and his brother?”  A “feud” (feud) is a long, serious a rgument between two people or two groups of people.  It usually is somethi ng that goes on for a very long time, and sometimes it can even be violent.  But he re, I don’t think we’re talking about any violence, just his father and his uncle don’t get along.

Eri said, “No, what happened?”  James says, “I’m not sure , but it was something that happened before they got married (the father an d the mother, presumably).

 My father held a grudge for years.”  “To hold a grudge ” (grudge) means to continue to be angry about something that happened a l ong time ago, especially in a situation where you don’t really have a good reaso n to be angry still.  James says, “about eight years ago, they (his father and uncle) made up.”  “To make up” means to end an argument and become friendly again.  A  husband and wife could be arguing and disagreeing about something and they both get mad at each other, but then they make up; they decide they’ll be  friendly again with each other.  The past tense of “make” is “made,” so James says, “ eight years ago, they made up.  There’s still no love lost between their wives,” however.  The expression “there’s no love lost” means there’s no of love or affection, respect or friendship between two people.  Someone says, “Well, there’s no love lost between me and my neighbor,” that means that you don’t  get along with – you don’t like your neighbor; you certainly don’t love each ot her.  James says there’s no love lost between his mother and his aunt.  He says, “ at least there’s no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.”  “The t wo of them” meaning the father and the uncle.  “Hard feelings” is anger and r esentment, usually because of an argument you had many years ago; it’s very similar to  a “grudge.”  In fact, sometimes after people have an argument and they make u p, they may say, “No hard feelings,” meaning let’s not continue to be angr y at each other.

James’ friend asks him if he’s going to go to the reunion , “So you’ll go to the reunion?” Eri says.  James says, “I’m not sure.  My mother’ s side of the family has always looked down on my father’s.”  “To look down on (someone)” means not to like someone because you don’t think they’re as goo d as you; you think you’re better than them; you disapprove of them.  You sh ould never look down on people who have less money than you, because you’re not necessarily any better than they are.  But unfortunately, the mother of James – her “side of the family,” meaning her relatives, have always looked down on  James’ father’s side of the family.  “Look,” by the way, has many different d efinitions in English, as you probably know.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

James says that his mother comes from old money.  The expressio n “old money” refers to a very rich family that has had a lot of money f or many years, maybe even many generations – 50, 60, 100 years.  The opposite of “old money” would be “new money”; usually we use the French expression “nouve au riche” to refer to people who have recently made money, but there’s a very negative connotation to that – a very negative idea.  When you say “nouveau riche” you’re usually looking down on those people, saying that they’re trying to be part of rich society; they’re trying too hard to be accepted by old mone y.  In any case, I don’t have either old money or new money, so it doesn’t reall y matter to me!

 James says that his mother comes from old money and her fami ly didn’t approve of her marrying his father.  “To approve of” means you t hink it’s a good idea; you support it.  So, James says that his mother had a very diffi cult time.  “It was really hard on my mother,” he says, “She really looked up to h er own mother and they were really close before my father came along.”  So he ’s saying that his mother looked up to his grandmother.  “To look up to” is the o pposite of “to look down on.”  “To look up to” means to admire, to respect, to think that someone is a very good person, someone that you want to be like.  So, h is mother and his grandmother got along very well, “they were really close, ” meaning they had a lot of affection, a lot of love for each other; they would talk to each other a lot.  They were really close before his father came along.  To say h e “came along” means that he became part of the situation, he came into the  life of James’ mother. “Close” is another word that has many meanings in Engli sh, so again take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information on t hat.

Eri says, “But that’s ancient history, isn’t it?”  “Ancient history,” when used in a conversation, means something that happened a long time ago, that most people don’t think is important or don’t even remember anymor e.  “Ancient history,” if you are talking about a subject in school, would refer to  ancient civilizations: the ancient Greeks, the ancient Romans in Western Europe, for  example.  But here, if someone says, “Oh, that’s ancient history,” they mean nob ody remembers that, that was a long time ago and is no longer important.  She says, “Considering how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it agai nst your mother for marrying your father.”  The expression “to turn out,” or the verb  “to turn out” means to happen or to end in a somewhat unexpected way, especiall y after a long period of time.  It isn’t always, however, unexpected.  You may be watching a football game or a baseball game and then you have to leave be fore it’s over; later, you may ask your friend, “How did the game turn out?”  What  was the result?  So here, she’s saying that considering the result – considerin g how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it against your mother .  “To hold (something) against (someone)” means to blame someone for something,  to think that something bad that happened is some particular person’s fault.  In this case, the grandmother is angry at James’ father for marrying James’ mother.

James says, “You’ve never met my grandmother (you don’t know  my grandmother).  One thing everyone knows about her is thi s: She doesn’t know the words to forgive and forget.”  This is an old expressi on, “to forgive and forget.”  The idea is that you should not blame people  or be angry with people for things that happened in the past – bad things.  Instead , you should forgive them; say, “Oh, that’s okay,” and then forget about it, not th ink about it anymore.  When James says “she doesn’t know the words,” he means she has never  heard – or

 more importantly here, she doesn’t believe in the expressi on “to forgive and forget.”  She will never forget.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Today’s dialogue turned out pretty well, I think, than ks to Dr. Lucy Tse, who wrote it.
