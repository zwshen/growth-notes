This episode is a dialogue about reading other peop le’s opinions on a website about something you may want to buy or may want to try.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marisa:  When we go to our favorite vacation spot i n two months, let’s stay at a different hotel.

Oscar:  I like the hotel we always stay at.  It’s i n a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it.

Marisa:  That’s just it.  It’s tried and true, but there’s no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.

Oscar:  I don’t need novelty.

Marisa:  Let’s just consider some of these other ho tels I’ve been reading about. They are very highly ranked and their ratings are v ery good.

Oscar:  You’re putting strangers’ reviews above our  own experience?

Marisa:  Of course not, but just look at this hotel .  It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.

Oscar:  Let me see that.  It also has some cons, su ch as being noisy and pricy.

Marisa:  Okay, maybe that isn’t the best example.  I didn’t notice that they got dinged on those things, but let’s look at a few oth ers.

Oscar:  I’ll keep an open mind, but I’m dubious abo ut online reviews.  I take everything I read with a grain of salt.  The only p eople who post reviews are those who love it or hate it.

Marisa:  I’ll just find a hotel that everyone loves .

Oscar:  And that doesn’t break the bank?

Marisa:  Right.

[end of dialogue]

Marisa begins our dialogue by saying to Oscar, “Whe n we go to our favorite vacation spot in two months, let’s stay at a differ ent hotel.”  A “spot” is a place or a location.  Marisa talks about their favorite vaca tion spot, the place they like to go.  It could be Hawaii, it could be New York City,  it could be Disneyland.  “Spot” has a number of different meanings in English, howe ver; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Oscar doesn’t want to stay at a different hotel.  H e says, “I like the hotel we always stay at,” that is, we always go to and sleep  at.  He says the hotel is in a convenient location.  “Convenient” means easy to ge t to, very comfortable, doesn’t cause any problems.  “It’s in a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it,” we already know it.

Marisa says, “That’s just it.”  That expression, “t hat’s just it,” means that’s exactly what the problem is.  “It’s tried and true,” she sa ys, “but there’s no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.”  “It’s tried and true” is an expression meaning it’s something that we’ve used s everal times and it has always been or usually is successful.  It’s been te sted and proven – it’s tried and true.  “But,” Marisa says, “there’s no novelty.”  “ Novelty” is something that is new, something that you have not done or seen or experie nced before.  Marisa says that there is no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place “year after year,” meaning every year.

Oscar says, “I don’t need novelty.”  I don’t need a  new experience.  Marisa says, “Let’s just consider some of these other hotels I’v e been reading about.  They are very highly ranked and their ratings are very good. ”  “To rank (rank) (something)” means to put things in order based on, usually, how  good they are.  So in a class, for example, a teacher may decide, well, she ’s the best student, he’s the second-best, she’s the third-best, he’s the fourth- best, and so forth.  The teacher is ranking the students: you’re first, you’re secon d, you’re third, you’re fourth.  I

was usually like 35 th  out of 36 students, that was usually my rank!  “Ra tings” are values that you give something based on how good it  is.  It could be a number 1 to 10, where 10 is the best and 1 is the worst.  “I  would rate” – notice we can use it as a verb also – “I would rate this movie a 5 ou t of 10,” meaning it’s not great, but it’s not terrible either, it’s somewhere in bet ween.  Or, “I would give this restaurant three stars.”  A star usually is used in  school by a teacher to indicate that you did a good job.  We use it in rating thing s like restaurants; the more stars it gets the better it is.  We do this for movies, t oo.  Well, that’s what “ratings” are; “ratings” are numbers – usually numbers that you gi ve something to indicate how good it is.  “Rankings” is when you take a group of  things and you put them in a certain order: first, second, or third.

Oscar says, “You’re putting strangers’ reviews abov e our own experience?”  A “review” is a written opinion – usually a written o pinion about how good or how bad something is.  And on the websites nowadays, on  many of them that sell things, you can read reviews, what people think abo ut the things that they bought.  Sometimes they like them, sometimes they d on’t.  And when they give a review, usually they give a rating; they say how ma ny points they would give it from 1 to 5, how many stars they would give this pa rticular product.  Oscar is asking Marisa if she’s putting the opinions – the r eviews of other people above their own experience, meaning she’s saying that oth er people’s experience is somehow more important in making the decision than their own experience.

Marisa says, “Of course not, but just look at this hotel.  It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.”  To receive thr ee stars, as I mentioned earlier, for a hotel or a restaurant is a way of saying how good  it is.  It could just be three as a number; we use stars for reasons I explained, bec ause that’s what has traditionally been used to indicate how good someth ing is.  So if the ratings go from one being the worst to four being the best, th en getting three out of four stars is pretty good.  Marisa says the hotel has a lot of pros.  “Pros” means positive things, good things, advantages.  “Pro” ha s a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some of those.  Often when we’re talking about the good and bad qualities  of something we’ll use the expression “pros and cons” (cons).  A “con” in this  case means a disadvantage, a negative or an undesirable thing.  So “pros” are go od, “cons” are bad.

Oscar says, “Let me see that.”  He’s apparently loo king at a piece of paper that has the reviews of the hotel on it.  He says the ho tel has some cons, such as being noisy and pricy.  “Pricy” (pricy) means expen sive, it costs a lot of money, it’s not cheap.  Marisa says, “Okay, maybe that isn ’t the best example.  I didn’t notice that they (the hotel) got dinged on those th ings, but let’s look at a few others.”  “To get dinged” (dinged) – the verb is “t o ding” (ding) – means to get a

lower rating on something, a negative comment or a negative review, a negative rating about something that you didn’t do very well .  So if we look at the reviews of a hotel, and we see that everyone complains abou t how noisy it is – how much noise there is in the hotel – we could say the hote l got dinged by people for all of the noise it has; it got criticized.

Marisa suggests looking at some other hotels.  Osca r says, “I’ll keep an open mind (meaning I’ll be willing to consider and think  about other things – other hotels), but I’m dubious about online reviews.”  “T o be dubious” (dubious) means to be skeptical, to be doubting, to question whethe r something is really true, whether you can really believe something.  Oscar is  dubious about online reviews, when people put their opinions on a websit e.  He says, “I take everything I read with a grain of salt.”  “To take things with a grain (grain) of salt” means to question and doubt everything that you are  told; don’t believe it just because somebody told you or just because you read it.  Although, you can believe everything we say here on ESL Podcast, so n o – no need to doubt anything!  But for everything else, you might want to take it with a grain of salt. The expression means to question it, to wonder whet her it’s really true.  Why do we say “a grain of salt”?  Well, it’s a very old id ea, at least as old as the ancient Romans, that it’s easier to eat food or difficult t hings to eat with a little bit of salt. It makes it taste a little better, and so you’re go ing to be able to eat it a little more easily.  Similarly, you can accept something someon e says perhaps a little more easily if you remember that maybe it’s not all comp letely true.  That’s the grain of salt that you – you eat, if you will, to accept som ething that someone tells you.

Oscar says that he’ll take everything he reads with  a grain of salt.  “The only people who post reviews,” he says, who put their op inions on these websites, “are those who love it or hate it.”  In other words , you get people who really like something or really hate something, and so in some ways you don’t get an average opinion because you only get the extremes: people who love or hate a certain thing.

Marisa says, “I’ll just find a hotel that everyone loves.”  Oscar then says, “And that doesn’t break the bank?”  Marisa says, “Right. ”  “To break the bank” means to cost a lot of money, so much money that you don’ t have any money left in your bank; you had to spend it all on this thing that yo u are buying, in this case the hotel that you are staying at.  Oscar doesn’t want a hotel that’s going to break the bank, that’s going to be very expensive.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Marisa:  When we go to our favorite vacation spot i n two months, let’s stay at a different hotel.

Oscar:  I like the hotel we always stay at.  It’s i n a convenient location and we’re already familiar with it.

This episode is all about the movies.  Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Martin:  What did you think of that movie?

Joanna:  It was okay, but I’m not really into big-b udget movies with a lot of special effects and big-name stars.

Martin:  Oh, you’re a film snob.  I bet you only wa tch indie films made on a shoestring budget with low production values.

Joanna:  No, that’s not true.  I just don’t like cr owd-pleasers that are predictable. I like movies that stretch the imagination and have  some artistic value.

Martin:  You mean you like those weird movies with no plot and a lot of strange characters.  They’re artsy, but leave you totally c onfused.

Joanna:  I don’t mind some ambiguity, if that’s wha t you mean.

Martin:  Well, I’m going to see the new Spiderboy  movie next week.  I don’t suppose you want to come?

Joanna:  Spiderboy ?  I’ve been looking forward to seeing that movie.

Martin:  But it’s a big-budget blockbuster.

Joanna:  I can’t watch artsy films all the time.  V ariety is the spice of life, don’t you think?

[end of dialogue]

Martin begins our dialogue by asking Joanna, “What did you think of that movie?” What was your opinion of that movie?  Joanna says, “It was okay, but I’m not really into big-budget movies.”  “To be into (somet hing)” is to like it, to find it enjoyable or pleasurable.  Joanna says she’s not re ally into big-budget movies. A “budget” (budget) is the amount of money that you  spend on something, usually it’s a plan of how much you’re going to spe nd on something.  A “big budget movie” would be a movie that was very expens ive to make; it cost millions and millions of dollars.  Well, Joanna doesn’t like  big budget movies with a lot of special effects and big-name stars.  “Special effec ts” in a movie or a television show are things that nowadays are created by comput ers – special computer graphics programs.  In the old days, they just used  to be very creative about doing things that aren’t real.  You’re not actually  seeing something that is real, you may think it’s real.  You may think that a real  car is blowing up.  Well actually, sometimes they do blow up cars.  But, you may see a  building that is being blown up.  Or, when they made Titanic , the movie, they didn’t actually take a real ship and put it into the ocean – I don’t think.  They us ed special effects; they used special tricks of the camera and of technology to m ake it look like that’s what you were seeing.  “Big-name stars” are famous stars; a “star” here means a well- known actor or actress.  “Star” has other meanings in English as well; find some of those in your Learning Guide – and in the sky!

Martin says, “Oh, you’re a film snob.”  Yeah Joanna , you’re a film snob!  What’s a “snob”?  A “snob” (snob) – don’t you love the way t hat word sounds?  “Snob, snob.”  I love the sound of the word!  Anyway, Joan na’s a film snob.  A “snob” is a person who thinks that their opinion, their taste s are superior or better than other people, especially things that have to do wit h artistic style or money. Someone who’s a snob may say, “Oh, I never eat at M cDonald’s, that’s where poor people eat.  That’s where people who don’t hav e very good taste eat.”  That might be something of a snobbish attitude; we may c all you a “food snob.”  Martin is calling Joanna a “film snob,” a movie snob; “fil m” is just another word for movie.

Martin says, “I bet you only watch indie films made  on a shoestring budget with low production values.”  “Indie” (indie) stands for  “independent.”  It usually refers to music or a movie that is made by a small company  or a group of individuals, not a big, large corporation, not one of the what w e would call “major studios” when it comes to movies.  It’s not made by one of t he large record companies when it comes to music.  Instead, it’s made often w ith a lot less money by a much smaller company or group of people.  They’re i ndependent of the big film and movie companies.  A “shoestring budget” is a lo w budget, something that

doesn’t cost very much money.  “Production values” are the qualities of the movie itself.  It refers to the techniques that are  used in the movie: the lighting, the sound, the music, the special effects.  Somethi ng that has a low production value looks like it was made with not very much mon ey.  Maybe it doesn’t look as professional as the movies where they spent million s and millions of dollars on. That’s a low production value movie.  Martin is say ing that Joanna only likes movies that are indie films, made on a shoestring b udget, with low production values.

Joanna says, “that’s not true.  I just don’t like c rowd-pleasers that are predictable.”  A “crowd-pleaser” is something that many or most people like but that is perhaps not very sophisticated or not very artistic, especially when it comes to movies.  “Predictable” is something that y ou can anticipate; you know what’s going to happen, there are no surprises.  If  you are watching a romantic comedy, you know that the man and the women are goi ng to get together at the end of the movie.  That’s predictable; we know that ’s going to happen.  Joanna doesn’t like movies that are predictable.  She says , “I like movies that stretch the imagination and have some artistic value.”  “To str etch the imagination” means to make you think of things you might not have thought  of before, and to do so in an exciting and artistic way.  By “artistic” I mean so mething that you would consider quality, something that is unique or interesting or  beautiful, something that is not just normal or common or predictable.

Martin says, “You mean you like those weird movies with no plot (no story) and a lot of strange characters (a lot of strange people) .  They’re artsy, but leave you totally confused.”  When we say a movie is “artsy” (artsy) we mean that it tries to be artistic.  Sometimes this can be a criticism; it  sometimes is used to describe a movie that perhaps tries to be artistic, maybe trie s a little bit too hard so that other parts of the movie, the plot, or the characte rs are not as important as making the movie seem like it is an artistic one.  Well, that’s what Martin says Joanna likes.  She likes weird movies with no plot – no story, and have a lot of strange characters.  “They’re artsy, but leave you totally (or completely) confused.”  You’re unclear, you’re uncertain, you d on’t know exactly what happened in movie.  That’s how I felt about Forrest  Gump .  I don’t know, I – maybe I just wasn’t paying attention, maybe I didn’ t have enough Coca-Cola that day that I saw the movie.  Kind of – kind of confus ed by the whole thing.  Don’t – don’t really get it.  Didn’t – didn’t really unders tand why everyone liked that movie so much, I don’t know.  I mean I don’t hate Tom Han ks.  You know what I’m saying?  I just – just didn’t like the movie very m uch.  Anyway, Martin thinks that the movies that Joanna likes would leave you totall y confused.

Joanna says, “I don’t mind some ambiguity, if that’ s what you mean.”  “I don’t mind” means it doesn’t bother me, it’s okay when I have some ambiguity in the movie.  “Ambiguity” (ambiguity) means that it isn’t  exactly certain, you’re not sure what exactly has happened.  Having ambiguity is hav ing uncertainty.

Martin says, “Well, I’m going to see the new Spider boy  movie next week.  I don’t suppose you want to come?”  That expression, “I don ’t suppose” (suppose), is very common.  It’s a phrase used to ask someone som ething when you think the answer will be “no,” or you expect the answer to be  “no.”  You go up to a beautiful woman and you say, “I don’t suppose you w ant to dance with me?”  And she says, “Here, on the subway?  Probably not.”  So  the lesson is don’t ask a beautiful woman to dance with you when you’re ridin g on the subway!  A bar, a dance club might be a good place to ask that questi on.

Joanna says, “Spiderboy ?  I’ve been looking forward to seeing that movie.”   I want to see that movie.  Martin says, “But it’s a b ig-budget blockbuster.”  A “blockbuster movie” is a movie that’s very popular and makes a lot of money. The – oh, that movie, uh, the one where the kids ki ll each other.  What’s that called?  It’s a new one; this is 2012 if you’re lis tening to this in the future.  And if you’re listing to this in the past, buy Apple and G oogle stock!  If you’re listening to this in like 2005-2006, something like that, trust me, you’ll thank me.  Anyway, um, that movie Hunger Games , that’s a blockbuster; that’s a movie that is goin g to make, you know, a billion dollars.  Well, Martin  says that the new movie he wants to see, Spiderboy , not a real movie, is a blockbuster.

Joanna says, “I can’t watch artsy films all the tim e.”  Martin is surprised Joanna wants to go and see the movie.  She says, “Variety is the spice of life, don’t you think?”  That expression, “variety is the spice of life,” means trying new things or doing new things, different things is good for you;  it’s interesting, it makes your life more interesting.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martin:  What did you think of that movie?

Joanna:  It was okay, but I’m not really into big-b udget movies with a lot of special effects and big-name stars.

Martin:  Oh, you’re a film snob.  I bet you only wa tch indie films made on a shoestring budget with low production values.

# Negotiating a Peace Treaty

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 803: Negotiating a Peace Treaty.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 803.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in the city – the beautiful city of Los Angeles, Calif ornia.

This episode is called “Negotiating a Peace Treaty. ”  A “treaty,” an agreement between two different countries.  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Ahmed:  Have you heard the news?

Menna:  The nations of Palicia and Isram have signe d a peace treaty.  This means that there will be an immediate ceasefire and  an end to hostilities.  This is a historic day!

Ahmed:  I never thought I’d live to see this day.  Has everything been settled?

Menna:  Only the most important things.  The border s have been decided, there will be a recognition of statehood, and political p risoners will be exchanged.

Ahmed:  That’s great, but does the treaty need to b e ratified by the people of the two nations?

Menna:  Yes, but the leaders have already signed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this po int.

Ahmed:  This means that refugees will be able to re turn home.

Menna:  That’s right.  They’ll be able to go home a t long last.

Ahmed:  This is a banner day for world peace, don’t  you think?

Menna:  Yes, and in that spirit, why don’t you call  Hanna and invite her over for dinner?  You two haven’t spoken in weeks.

Ahmed:  It’s not going to be that easy.  A peace tr eaty with my sister will require a formal apology and reparations!

[end of dialogue]

Ahmed begins our dialogue by saying to Menna, “Have  you heard the news?” Menna says, “The nations of Palicia and Isram have signed a peace treaty.”  The “nations” mean the countries.  We use “country” and  “nation” often to mean the same thing in English.  These two countries – these  two nations have signed a peace treaty.  A “treaty” is an official agreement between two governments usually.  A “peace treaty” would be when two govern ments are fighting – when two countries are fighting and you want to end the war – end the fighting, you might have a peace treaty.  Menna says, “This means  that there will be an immediate ceasefire and an end to hostilities.”  A “ceasefire” (ceasefire – one word) is an agreement to stop shooting at each othe r, to stop sending bombs over to the other country.  “To fire” can also mean  to shoot, like a weapon – like a gun.  “To cease” means to stop.  So, a “ceasefire” is when you stop firing; you stop shooting each other.  Menna says that the peac e treaty will make it so that there is an immediate ceasefire and an end to hosti lities.  “Hostilities” are the same as fighting; “acts of war” we might call them.   Menna says, “This is an historic day!”  “Historic” (historic) means somethi ng you will remember for a very long time, something that will be remembered in the  future.  Of course, you can’t remember it in the past, so…!  Anyway, “historic” i s something very memorable, something that many people will talk about years an d years from now.

Ahmed says, “I never thought I’d live to see this d ay.  Has everything been settled?”  When we say something has been “settled”  (settled) we mean it’s been agreed upon or it’s been decided; all of the detail s, all of the small arrangements have been made.

Menna says, “Only the most important things,” meani ng not everything has been settled, but the most important things have; they’v e agreed on the most important things.  “The borders have been decided, there will  be a recognition of statehood, and political prisoners will be exchanged.”  “Borde rs” are lines that separate two countries.  They’re not real lines, we would call t hem imaginary lines that separate two different areas or two different count ries.  We can talk about borders between two states or two regions as well.  “The borders,” Menna says, “have been decided (they decided where that line is  going to be), there will be a recognition of statehood.”  “Statehood” is when you  say the other people, the

people who are living in this area are officially a  country.  So, to “recognize” that is to say officially “okay, yes, you are a separate  country.”  This often happens when one part of a country doesn’t want to be part of the rest of the country and they will often want to separate themselves and hav e their own nation – their own state.  Here, “state” means the same as “country.”  “State” can also be part of a country, like the United States has 50 states withi n one country, but we can also refer to an entire nation as a state.  Menna says, “political prisoners will be exchanged.”  A “prisoner” is someone who’s been arr ested and put in jail – put into a prison.  A “political prisoner” is someone w ho is arrested because of their political beliefs.  They didn’t steal anything, the y didn’t kill anyone, but because the government doesn’t like their opinion they put them in prison; we call those “political prisoners.”

Ahmed says, “That’s great, but does the treaty need  to be ratified by the people of the two nations?”  “To be ratified,” or simply “ to ratify” (ratify) means to agree officially to do something, to approve something.  In the United States, for example, where there’s a treaty between two differe nt countries – the United States and, say, Canada – the president of the Unit ed States has to say, “yes, I agree,” but the treaty needs to be ratified by anot her part of the U.S. government, the United States Senate, which is part of the grou p of people who are our elected representatives.  So, that’s an example of “ratification.”  Ahmed is saying or asking if the treaty needs to be ratified by the  people who live in these two different states – these two different countries.

Menna says, “Yes, but the leaders have already sign ed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this po int.”  When we talk about “formalities” (formalities) we’re referring to thin gs that have to be done according to the rules, but that are not important difficulti es or things that we can’t solve. There are things that need to be done, but it isn’t  something that’s going to get in the way of or stop this thing from happening.

Ahmed said, “This means that refugees will be able to return home.”  “Refugees” (refugees) are people who have to leave their count ry, usually because it’s too dangerous for them there, and want to return back t o their country some day. Typically, refugees have to leave during a war or b ecause of some sort of political problem, otherwise it may be too dangerou s for them and so they leave. But in this case, the refugees will be able to go b ack home because of this peace treaty.

Menna says, “That’s right.  They’ll be able to go h ome at long last.”  The expression “at long last” simply means finally, aft er a long period of time.  Ahmed says, “This is a banner day for world peace, don’t you think?”  A “banner (banner)

day” is an important day, a day that we might say i s historic, or a day that is very important.  Sometimes we talk about a “banner day” to refer to someone who has done something better than they have ever done it b efore on that day, or this is a day when that sort of thing has been done better th an it has before.  “It was a banner day for the stock market.”  That means it wa s a very good day.  A “banner day” is always a good thing.  “Banner” has a couple  of other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for thos e.

Ahmed thinks this is a banner day for world peace, for the idea that there will be no war or fighting anywhere on earth.  Menna says, “Yes (this is a banner day for world peace), and in that spirit, why don’t you cal l Hanna and invite her over for dinner?”  The expression “in that spirit” is used w hen we are going to introduce another topic, but it’s related to what we’ve been talking about already.  So, “in that spirit” here means since we’ve been talking ab out peace and world peace and people getting along again, Menna suggests to A hmed that he call Hanna and invite her over for dinner.  She says, “You two  haven’t spoken in weeks.” Often when you say two people haven’t spoken we mea n they haven’t spoken to each other because they’ve been angry at each other  or mad at each other.

Ahmed says, “It’s not going to be that easy.”  It’s  not going to be easy just to call her and invite her over; there may be some more dif ficult things they have to resolve first.  He says, “A peace treaty with my si ster will require a formal apology and reparations!”  An “apology” is when you tell so meone that you’re sorry, you did something wrong.  A “formal apology” might be a  written apology – an official apology.  We don’t normally use that expression in talking about two different people or two members of a family, so Ahmed is bein g a little humorous here. What he’s saying is that it’s going to be very diff icult because his sister, if I understand him correctly, needs to give him an apol ogy; he thinks his sister did something wrong.  He also says his sister has to gi ve him reparations. “Reparations” (reparations) is when one country bea ts another country – defeats another country in a war, and as part of the treaty  one country, the losing country, has to give some sort of money or somethin g of value to make up for what they did wrong, make up for the fact that they  were fighting this war. Reparations can also be something that a government  may give a group of people for having injured them or hurt them, usuall y it is an amount of money that has to be given.  Well, Ahmed thinks his sister nee ds to give him reparations, so obviously they are going to have a difficult time m aking peace with each other.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ahmed:  Have you heard the news?

Menna:  The nations of Palicia and Isram have signe d a peace treaty.  This means that there will be an immediate ceasefire and  an end to hostilities.  This is a historic day!

Ahmed:  I never thought I’d live to see this day.  Has everything been settled?

Menna:  Only the most important things.  The border s have been decided, there will be a recognition of statehood, and political p risoners will be exchanged.

Ahmed:  That’s great, but does the treaty need to b e ratified by the people of the two nations?

Menna:  Yes, but the leaders have already signed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this po int.

Ahmed:  This means that refugees will be able to re turn home.

Menna:  That’s right.  They’ll be able to go home a t long last.

Ahmed:  This is a banner day for world peace, don’t  you think?

Menna:  Yes, and in that spirit, why don’t you call  Hanna and invite her over for dinner?  You two haven’t spoken in weeks.

Ahmed:  It’s not going to be that easy.  A peace tr eaty with my sister will require a formal apology and reparations!

# Dealing with Time Changes in Scheduling

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 804: Dealing with Time Changes in Scheduling.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 804.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can also take a look at some of our p remium courses, our special courses in business and daily English on our websit e.

This episode is all about scheduling and changing t imes.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danny:  Don’t bother looking for next year’s meetin g calendar.  I’m still working on it.

Tessa:  What’s taking so long?

Danny:  This is my first time scheduling all of the  major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the th ings I have to keep in mind. For instance, our bylaws say that we have to have a  management meeting every 60 days.  This is a leap year, so do I have to take  that into account?

Tessa:  That’s a tough one.  I’m not sure.

Danny:  And what about daylight saving time?  I hav e to remember when clocks will be set ahead and back.

Tessa:  That’s easy.  My high school teacher taught  us to remember it with a simple phrase: “fall back and spring ahead.”

Danny:  Okay, but that doesn’t help me with dates.  Apparently, daylight saving time changes on different dates in different countr ies.  And I have to factor in time zones to set the time for each meeting, with meetin g times that work for each international office that will be participating.

Tessa:  You’re right, it’s a tall order, but you do  know that someone has done this before?  You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

Danny:  Yeah, Carl set the meeting calendar last ye ar, but he left the company last month.

Tessa:  Can’t you just take last year’s meeting cal endar and fudge it?

Danny:  Why do you think Carl is no longer with the  company?

Tessa:  Ah.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins Danny saying to Tessa, “Don’t b other looking for next year’s meeting calendar.”  “Don’t bother” is a phrase we u se to tell someone not to do something because it isn’t possible or they won’t b e successful.  “Don’t bother” means don’t look for next year’s meeting calendar.  “Calendar” is, you probably know, a record of days and weeks and years that you  use to perhaps schedule your life around, to plan, to know what date and da y it is.  Danny says he’s still working on next year’s meeting calendar, which we g uess is a calendar telling you which days and times they will have meetings at  their company.

Tessa says, “What’s taking so long?”  Why is it tak ing you so long, you idiot?  No! She didn’t say “you idiot,” she could have but she didn’t.  So the idiot Danny says, “This is my first time scheduling all of the major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the things I h ave to keep in mind.”  Danny says this is the first time he has scheduled – he h as decided what days and times – all of the major or important meetings for the company.  “And,” he says, “I’m getting thrown off by all of the things I have  to keep in mind.”  “To be thrown off” means to be confused, to be misled, when someo ne makes it or something makes it difficult or impossible for you to underst and something.  It can also be used sometimes when some unexpected or sudden chang e interrupts your plans so you can no longer do what you were going to do: “The thunderstorm (the rainstorm) canceled our flight (our airplane flight ).  It threw off our plans.”  It made them impossible to complete; it changed them unexpe ctedly.

In the dialogue, Danny is thrown off; he’s not able  to do what he thought he was able to do because all of the things he has to keep  in mind – he has to remember.  “To keep in mind” (mind) means to rememb er.  Danny says, “For instance (for example), our bylaws say that we have  to have a management meeting every 60 days.”  Your “bylaws” (bylaws) are  your official rules created by

your organization.  The bylaws are usually rules th at the company uses to help it operate more smoothly, to make sure everything is d one correctly.  Well, these bylaws say they have to have a management meeting –  a meeting of the managers – every 60 days.  Danny says, “This is a l eap year, so do I have to take that into account?”  A “leap (leap) year” is a  year, you probably know, that has 366 days; it happens once every four years when  we have a February 29 th , not just 28 days in February.  Well, poor Danny is not sure what to do during a leap year.  He says, “do I have to take that into a ccount?”  “To take (something) into account” means to include it or consider it in  your decision or your opinion. You have to take into account that Danny is an idio t, and that helps you understand the dialogue a little better; you have t o consider that in your opinion. Danny is wondering whether you have to take into ac count the fact that this year is a leap year.

Tessa says, “That’s a tough one.”  Now, Tessa, it’s  not a tough one, it’s obvious. February 29 th  is a day, you just count that into the 60 days.  I t’s not that difficult people!  Huh!  I’m sorry, I – I’m not in a very goo d mood today.  I don’t know why, probably didn’t have enough coffee this morning.  D id I tell you I’m drinking coffee now?  Yeah, yeah.  No, um – well I still dri nk, uh, tea, but, uh, I’ve started drinking coffee again.  But when I don’t have my co ffee then, you know, I’m not in a very good mood.

Anyway, back to our dialogue: Tessa says – wrongly – that this is a tough one, this is a difficult decision.  She says she’s not s ure.  Danny says, “And what about daylight saving time?”  “Daylight saving time ” is a system used in many countries where you move your clock ahead one hour and then back one hour twice a year in order to give people, in part, more  hours of light in the evening time.  We talked about daylight saving time back on  English Café number 78, many, many years ago.  Danny says, “I have to remem ber when clocks will be set ahead and back.”  “To set ahead” means to turn the clock forward one hour, so instead of being 10:00 now it’s 11:00.  “To set the clock back” would mean to go from 11:00 to 10:00.  It’s really not that compl icated Danny!  I should mention that the expression “to set back” has other meaning s in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Tessa says, “That’s easy.  My high school teacher t aught us to remember it with a simple phrase: ‘fall back and spring ahead.’”  Th is expression “fall back and spring ahead” is used in English to remind people w hen they are supposed to put their – or set their clocks ahead and when they’re supposed to set them back.  In the fall – in the autumn, they put the clocks back;  they fall back.  “To fall back” means to go backwards, and so we use the two meanin gs of the word “fall.” “Fall” means the season of autumn: in North America  roughly October,

November, December.  And it also means, when you sa y “fall back,” you mean to go back, to move backwards.  So, “fall back” remind s you that in the fall you set your clock back an hour, and in the spring you spri ng ahead.  “To spring ahead” means to jump forward.  “Spring” also refers to the  season of the year that comes between winter and summer.  So “spring ahead” means  to move your clock forward one hour during the springtime.

Danny says, “Okay, but that doesn’t help me with da tes.  Apparently, daylight saving time changes on different dates in different  countries.”  This is true; it’s different in the United States than it is in Europe .  He says, “And I have to factor in time zones to set the time for each meeting.”  “ To factor in” means to include or to consider; it means the same as “to take (some thing) into account.”  Danny has to factor in time zones.  A “time zone” is a ge ographic area where people use the same time.  Here in California, we’re in the Pa cific time zone.  So, it’s the same time in Los Angeles as it is in Oregon or in W ashington or in British Columbia, Canada, or in Baja, California.  New York  City is in the Eastern time zone, where there is a three hour difference betwee n the Pacific and the Eastern time zones.  Well, Danny has to factor in time zone s to set or to establish the time for each meeting because there are people in d ifferent parts of the world who participate.

Tessa says, “You’re right (you’re correct), it’s a tall order.”  A “tall order” is something that’s very difficult or challenging that  you have been asked to do. Tessa says, “but you do know that someone has done this before?  You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”  This is an old expres sion: “to reinvent (reinvent) the wheel” means you don’t have to waste time doing som ething that someone has already done.  “To invent” means to create, to come  up with a new idea.  Well the wheel was invented many, many years ago; you don’t have to come up with the idea of a wheel again.  It means, again, you don’t need to waste your time; you can find out what someone else did before and do wh at they did.

Danny says, “Yeah, Carl set the meeting calendar la st year, but he left the company last month.”  Tessa says, “Can’t you just t ake last year’s meeting schedule and fudge it?”  “To fudge (fudge) (somethi ng)” means to change something in a small way, presenting it as the real  answer even though you’re really just guessing; you’re not really sure.  You’ re trying to fool someone into thinking that you know what the answer is, so you k ind of take a guess but you know it’s not the exact answer, or you don’t think it’s the exact answer.  Danny says, “Why do you think Carl is no longer with the company?”  Tessa says, “Ah.” In other words, the joke here is that Carl, the per son who used to do the calendar, didn’t do a very good job.  He – he wasn’ t accurate; he fudged his

calendar dates.  He didn’t calculate them very care fully, and that’s why he was fired.  So, it would be a bad idea for Danny to do the same thing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Danny:  Don’t bother looking for next year’s meetin g calendar.  I’m still working on it.

Tessa:  What’s taking so long?

Danny:  This is my first time scheduling all of the  major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the th ings I have to keep in mind.

# Listening to Shock Jocks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 805: Listening to Shock Jocks.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 805.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, home of Center f or Educational Development – oh yeah, and Hollywood, and a few other things.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there, download a Le arning Guide right after you become a member of ESL Podcast.

This episode is about shock jocks.  These are peopl e on the radio who like to say surprising and unusual things.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

I like listening to the radio on my morning commute  each day.  This morning, though, my favorite DJs weren’t on the air. ………

Howard:  Do you know what happened to the Kelvin an d Ben show this morning?

Robin:  Kelvin and Ben are both on suspension.  The  FCC fined the radio station. Apparently, Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two weeks ago that the FCC found objectionable.

Howard:  That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are shock jo cks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.  They work in a bi g market producing a morning show with a lot of competition.  They have to push the envelope.

Robin:  That may be true, but the FCC said that the y went too far.  On Mother’s Day, they invited several mothers to be in-studio g uests for a segment.  They cursed them, said sexually explicit things, and cal led them obscene names.

Howard:  They did that?!

Robin:  I guess you weren’t listening that morning.

Howard:  No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about shock jocks.  We actually tal ked about shock jocks back on English Café number 144, but we thought we’d talk a  little more about it and some specific vocabulary that you might hear in rel ationship to shock jocks. What are shock jocks?  Well, basically they are peo ple who host a radio program, usually in the morning, and they attract i nterest – they get people to listen to them by saying very unusual things, perha ps expressing opinions that they know people will be offended by, people won’t like, people will be shocked by.  “To be shocked by (something)” means to be sur prised and perhaps angered at something.  The word “jock” comes from “jockey.”   A “disc jockey” – we usually just call them “DJs,” by their initials – are peopl e who host radio music programs who decide what songs are going to be played.  You can also have a DJ at a dance club; he or she is the person who is deciding  which songs are going to be listened to and danced to.  So, “DJ” means “disc jo ckey,” and the word “jock” in the expression “shock jock” comes from “jockey.”  A  “jockey,” you may also know, is the person who rides a horse in a race.  I ’m not sure why we call people who are on radio “disc jockeys” who play music, but  we do.

So, after that long introduction now let’s get to o ur actual story and dialogue.  It begins by me saying, “I like listening to the radio  on my morning commute each day.”  Your “commute” (commute) is the trip between  your home and where you work.  If you don’t work at home, if you work in an  office or a school, a hospital, wherever, then you have a commute; you have a trip between your home and your work and then back again.  “Commute” has a cou ple of meanings in English, however.  Be sure to take a look at our Le arning Guide for some of those.

I say that this morning my favorite DJs weren’t on the air.  We mentioned “DJ” means “disc jockey.”  “To be on the air” means to b e on the television or to be on the radio; you can hear them on the radio or you ca n see them on the television. But this morning, my favorite DJs weren’t on the ai r; they weren’t on the radio, in this case.  Instead, we hear a shock jock by the na me of Howard, and Howard begins by saying, “Do you know what happened to the  Kelvin and Ben show this morning?”  The Kelvin and Ben show, we must guess, is another radio program.

Robin, the other DJ, says, “Kelvin and Ben are both  on suspension.”  “To be on suspension” means that you are not allowed to do so mething, usually it’s because you did something wrong or they are investi gating the possibility that you did something wrong.  “To be suspended” or “on suspension” means to be temporarily – for a short time – not able to do you r job.  Robin says, “The FCC fined the radio station.”  “FCC” are the initials f or the Federal Communications

Commission.  This is the U.S. government agency res ponsible for regulating television, radio, and other types of broadcast com munication: the FCC.  The FCC fined the radio station.  “To fine” (fine) as a  verb means to charge a fee when you do something wrong.  So for example, if yo u go too fast on the freeway and the police officer catches you, he or she may g ive you a fine, money that you have to pay the government as punishment.  “Apparen tly,” Robin continues, “Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two wee ks ago that the FCC found objectionable.”  Something that is “objectionable” is something that other people might find very rude, very unpleasant, we might say  “offensive,” it makes them angry.

Howard says, “That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are sho ck jocks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.”  Something tha t is “provocative” is done in order to get a strong reaction from someone else.  It’s done in order to make other people feel very strong emotions.  “To be pro vocative” means to try to get the other person angry, although you could also use  this word in a sexual sense. “To be sexually provocative” would be, say, to dres s in a certain way that would cause other people to take a sexual interest in you .  But we’re not talking about that.  We’re talking about being provocative in the  sense of making people angry or have a strong emotion.

Howard says that these shock jocks work in a big ma rket.  A “big market” here does not refer to the supermarket or a place where you might buy milk and cheese.  Here, “market” refers to a group of people  who might want to buy your product or service.  So when you say it’s a “big ma rket,” you mean it’s a large group of people who might be interested in what you  are selling or what you have to offer.  Sometimes when we talk about television and radio, it refers to the area where these people live; so Los Angeles is a big ma rket, so is New York, so is Chicago.  These are large cities, and they have a l ot of people who live there, and who might be interested in listening to somethi ng or watching something. That’s what Howard means when he says that Kelvin a nd Ben work in a big market.  They produce a morning show with a lot of competition.  A “morning show” is just a radio or television program that’s on in the morning.  I think these are popular in most countries throughout the world.   When you’re driving and listening to the radio you have often two people wh o make jokes and think they’re very funny and play music; that’s a morning show.  Howard says that these shock jocks have to push the envelope.  The express ion “to push the envelope” (envelope) means to do something more than what was  expected, or to go beyond some sort of limit, to do something that has n’t been done before.

Robin says, “That may be true, but the FCC said tha t they went too far.”  They did too much of something.  “To go too far” means t o break the rules, to go

beyond what you should do, but to do something wron g.  It’s a negative thing. You’ve gone too far, you’ve been too extreme.  “On Mother’s Day,” Robin says, “they invited several mothers to be in-studio guest s for a segment.”  “In-studio” means the people were in the same room as the DJs.  Sometimes you will have DJs or television people interview someone who’s no t in the same room; they may be in a different city or they may be calling b y telephone from a different part of the country.  Well, these were guests – these we re people in the same room where they were recording the program.  A “segment”  is a part of a large show, a larger program.  So we talk about segments on our E nglish Café; the English Café is divided into different parts and we call th ose parts segments, or we could.

Robin says the shock jocks cursed the mothers.  “To  curse” (curse) means to use bad language, to swear, to be vulgar, to say bad wo rds.  The shock jocks also said sexually explicit things.  Something that is “ sexually explicit” is something that has a very obvious sexual meaning, usually use d in such a way to shock or provoke someone, to offend someone.  “Obscene” (obs cene) is similar; anything that is obscene is something that is not acceptable  by society.  Something that is obscene could be sexually explicit also, but it cou ld be just something that was very rude or offensive or disgusting, something tha t people don’t accept and don’t want to see or don’t want to listen to; that’ s obscene.  Sometimes we use this as an adjective to mean too much or extreme: “ The housing prices in Los Angeles are obscene.  You have to pay an obscene am ount of money.”  Well, we don’t mean anything sexual or even anything vulgar,  we just mean it’s way too much.  It’s so much that it can make you angry, eve n, that’s how much you have to pay for a house in Los Angeles – which is pretty  true actually!

Howard says, “They did that?!”  They did all of tho se terrible things?  Robin says, “I guess you weren’t listening that morning.”  Howa rd says, “No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!”  I’m really shocked.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I like listening to the radio on my morning commute  each day.  This morning, though, my favorite DJs weren’t on the air. ………

Howard:  Do you know what happened to the Kelvin an d Ben show this morning?

Robin:  Kelvin and Ben are both on suspension.  The  FCC fined the radio station. Apparently, Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two weeks ago that the FCC found objectionable.

Howard:  That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are shock jo cks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.  They work in a bi g market producing a morning show with a lot of competition.  They have to push the envelope.

Howard:  They did that?!

Robin:  I guess you weren’t listening that morning.

Howard:  No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!

[end of dialogue]

We hope our scripts are never objectionable, certai nly never obscene.  I don’t think they will ever be that way, because they’re w ritten by the wonderful writer, Dr. Lucy Tse.

# Essential and Optional Things

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 806: Essential and Optional Things.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 806. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. You can go there and dow nload a Learning Guide for this episode. You can also take a look at one of ou r premium courses and while you're there take a look at our ESL Podcast blog.

This episode is about essential or necessary things  and things that aren't necessary. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ella:  It’s so exciting that you’ll be spending a m onth studying in McQuillanland this summer. When do you start packing?

Marty:  I’ve already started. The organizers of the  program gave me a list of things I need to bring.

Ella:  That’s really helpful.

Marty:  Yeah. They say that it’s essential that I b ring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. The weather in McQuillanland is really unpredictable.

Ella:  Oh, I didn’t know that.

Marty:  Yeah, and they say that it’s advisable that  I bring medications for every malady I can think of because there are a lot of he alth dangers.

Ella:  Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanland.

Marty:  Me, neither. And while it’s optional, it’s also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home. McQuillanland has a very high  crime rate and visitors are often targeted.

Ella:  Geez, that’s a lot to take in.

Marty:  You’re telling me. And the list says that i t is absolutely required that I take a self-defense course before going. You never know what to expect in McQuillanland.

Ella:  You’re not having second thoughts about goin g, are you?

Marty:  No, why?

[end of dialogue]

Ella begins our dialogue by saying to Marty “It's s o exciting that you'll be spending a month studying in McQuillanland this sum mer.” McQuillanland is one of those difficult to find countries on a map! Ella  says, “When do you start packing?” To “pack” (pack) here means to prepare for a trip by putting all of your things into a suitcase or a piece of luggage or a b aggage. Pack has a number of meanings in English, however. Almost all of them – well, some of them are in the Learning Guide.

Marty says, “I've already started. I already have b egun. The organizers of the program, the people who are in charge of the progra m gave me a list of things I need to bring.” Ella says, “That’s really helpful.”   Marty says, “Yeah,” our informal way of saying yes. Marty says, “They say that it's essential that I bring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. It's “essent ial.” It's necessary. It's important that I bring warm weather and cold weathe r clothes.

“Warm-weather clothes” would be clothing you would wear when it's hot out and obviously “cold-weather clothes” would be clothing you would wear when it's cold out. Marty says, “The weather in McQuillanland is r eally unpredictable. “Un” (un) as a prefix that goes before a word means not, so “ unpredictable” means not predictable. Something that is predictable is somet hing you can know in advance before it happens. You know what's going to happen.  But unpredictable is when you don’t know what is going to happen. And that’s the way the weather is in McQuillanland. Here in Los Angeles, it's much more predictable.

Ella says, “Oh, I didn’t know that.” Marty says, “Y eah.” (He likes to say “yeah” a lot.) “Yeah, and they say that it's advisable that I bring medications for every malady I can think of.” “Advisable” comes from the verb to “advise” (advise). It means it's recommended. It's a good thing to do. Yo u don’t have to do it, but it's a good thing. It will help. If you want to improve yo ur English, it's good to listen to these audio mp3 files, but it's advisable to get the Learning Guide. Of course, what else would I say? Marty says it's advisable th at he bring “medications,” that is medicines, things that you take, drugs that you take for your health “for every

malady.” A “malady” (malady) means an illness or a sickness. Marty is supposed to bring medications for every malady he can think of because there are a lot of health dangers in McQuillanland, which I don’t thin k is really true. I don’t know where the scriptwriter is getting her information. Anyway, health dangers would be things that may make you sick, things that are d angerous to your health.

Ella says, “Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanl and.” Yeah, of course you didn’t because it isn't true, Ella! Marty says, “Me , neither,” meaning neither did I. “And while it's optional,” Marty says, “it's also s uggested that I leave all of my valuables at home.” Something that’s “optional” mea ns something that is not required. It's a good idea, but you don’t have to d o it, sort of like advisable. “While it's optional,” he says, “it's also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home.” To “suggest” means to recommend. To say it's  a good idea. Here’s something you might want to do – that’s to suggest.  It's suggested that Marty leave all of his valuables at home. A “valuable” is  anything that is worth a lot of money. It could be jewelry like a ring. It could be  your cellphone. It could be, I don’t know, one of our Learning Guides, something y ou wouldn’t want anyone to steal. Those would all be valuables. Marty is sayin g that he’s been told basically it's dangerous in McQuillanland because that’s why you would not want to bring your valuables.

In fact, in the next sentence he says, “McQuillanla nd has a very high crime rate and visitors are often targeted.” A “crime rate” re fers to the number of crimes that happen in a population. Crimes are illegal things, things that are done typically against other people or other people’s property. So , killing someone would be a crime. Stealing from someone would be a crime. But Marty is saying is that there is a lot of crime in McQuillanland and visitors, pe ople who are visiting McQuillanland are often targeted. “Targeted” comes from the verb to “target” (target). To target means to do something that affe cts a particular group of people, to intentionally affect a group of people. You want to just go after a certain group. So, on Saturday morning if you watch  television, a lot of the commercials, a lot of the advertisements are target ed toward children. That’s their audience. That’s who they are making the comm ercial for. Well, you can use targeted either in a positive or a negative sen se. Here it's used in a negative sense. What Marty is saying is that these criminals , these people who commit or do crimes, look for visitors and they are the ones that they rob or do something bad to.

Ella says, “Geez, that’s a lot to take in.” To “tak e in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get some new information and to really u nderstand it, to accept it, to think about it and say “Yes, I understand everythin g that is being told me.” In this

case, Ella is obviously surprised to hear these lie s – and they are lies! – about McQuillanland.

Marty says, “You're telling me.” This is a pretty c ommon informal phrase. We use it to show that you completely agree with what anot her person has said. It's often used when you have just heard someone say something  critical or negative, often you are communicating to them that you have h ad a similar experience or that you think the same way. “You're telling me” is  a way really of saying you don’t need to tell me. I already know that. I have personal experience with that, for example.

Marty says, “The list says that it is absolutely re quired that I take a self-defense course before going.” To “require” means to say it is necessary. It is something you must do. Other words we would use would be “obl igatory” or “mandatory.” Marty says it is required that he take a self-defen se course. “Self-defense” is learning how to protect yourself against someone wh o might hurt you, someone who might attack you. Marty says, “You never know w hat to expect in McQuillanland.” Now, this is absolute nonsense of c ourse. McQuillanland is a very safe place. There are no crimes. I don’t know what's going on in this dialogue. These people are crazy. I'm going to have  to talk to the scriptwriter about this. I'm not happy. I'm not happy. McQuillan land, trust me it's a very nice place!

Ella says, “You're not having second thoughts about  going, are you?” To have “second thoughts” means to have doubts, to question  whether one is doing the right thing. Marty says, “No, why?” meaning why sho uld I have second thoughts. Well, you shouldn’t have second thoughts Marty beca use McQuillanland is one of the best places to go.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ella:  It’s so exciting that you’ll be spending a m onth studying in McQuillanland this summer. When do you start packing?

Marty:  I’ve already started. The organizers of the  program gave me a list of things I need to bring.

Ella:  That’s really helpful.

Marty:  Yeah. They say that it’s essential that I b ring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. The weather in McQuillanland is really unpredictable.

Ella:  Oh, I didn’t know that.

Marty:  Yeah, and they say that it’s advisable that  I bring medications for every malady I can think of because there are a lot of he alth dangers.

Ella:  Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanland.

Marty:  Me, neither. And while it’s optional, it’s also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home. McQuillanland has a very high  crime rate and visitors are often targeted.

Ella:  Geez, that’s a lot to take in.

Marty:  You’re telling me. And the list says that i t is absolutely required that I take a self-defense course before going. You never know what to expect in McQuillanland.

Ella:  You’re not having second thoughts about goin g, are you?

Marty:  No, why?

# Getting an Unexpected Marriage Proposal

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 807: Getting an Unexpected Marriage Proposal.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 807. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there and take a look  at some of our special business and daily English courses. I think you mig ht enjoy them.

This episode is a dialogue between Sean and Ayako a bout someone making an offer, a proposal of marriage to another person, wh o I guess doesn’t expect it. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sean:  By now, I think you know how I feel about yo u. I’m madly in love with you and I believe in my heart of hearts that you’re my soul mate.

Ayako:  That’s really sweet of you to say.

Sean:  And because I feel the way I do, I would lik e to ask you a very important question.

Ayako:  Okay, but why are you getting down on one k nee?

Sean:  Ayako, would you marry me?

Ayako:  Marry you?! Is this a marriage proposal?

Sean:  Yes, and before you say anything else, I jus t want you to know that I’ve given this a lot of thought and I’m convinced that we’re made for each other.

Ayako:  I don’t think...

Sean:  And you just have to say the word and we cou ld elope tomorrow, if you wanted to.

Ayako:  Elope?!

Sean:  Or, if you prefer, we can have a lavish wedd ing. I’m not picky. I just want us to be husband and wife.

Ayako:  Sean, you’re a really nice guy, but don’t y ou think you might be jumping the gun?

Sean:  No. You know what they say: “When it’s right , it’s right.”

Ayako:  We’ve only been on two dates!

Sean:  Yes, but they have been the best two dates o f my life!

[end of dialogue]

Sean begins by saying to Ayako, “By now by this poi nt in time, I think you know how I feel about you. I'm madly in love with you.” To be “in love” with someone means that you feel a strong romantic connection. I n this case, to be “madly in love” means to be very much in love, to have very s trong romantic feelings toward another person. I'm madly in love with you. “And,” Sean continues, “I believe in my heart of hearts that you are my soul mate, that you're my soul mate.” “In my heart of hearts” is a phrase we use w hen you are saying something that you believe in very much, that you know is tru e. In my heart of hearts, what I really believe, what I really think – is what Sean is saying here. He really believes that Ayako is his soul mate. A “soul” (soul) “mate”  (mate) is a person that has all of the qualities and characteristics for a romantic  partner, for the perfect romantic partner, someone who you could spend the rest of yo ur life with, who understands the world the way you understand the wo rld (even if you're crazy!).

Ayako says, “That’s really sweet of you to say.” “S weet” (sweet) here means nice, kind. It's not a very strong word, however. W hen you say, “Oh, that’s very sweet of him,” you mean it's nice of him, it's kind  of him. It's definitely a positive thing to say about someone, but perhaps not what yo u would say when someone says that you are his or her soul mate.

Sean says, continuing on, “And because I feel the w ay I do because I have these thoughts, these beliefs, these feelings, I would li ke to ask you a very important question.”

Ayako says, “Okay, but why are you getting down on one knee?” The expression “to get down on one knee” means to bend one knee an d let the other knee of your leg go down against the ground. That’s the tra ditional pose or the traditional position that a man uses to ask a woman to marry hi m. To get down on one knee

means to ask someone to marry you and traditionally  that’s what a man would do in asking a woman to marry him.

Sean says, “Ayako, would you marry me?” Would you b ecome my wife?

Ayako says, “Marry you?” She’s quite surprised, sho cked even. “Is this a marriage proposal?” “A marriage proposal” is a requ est from one person, usually the man (traditionally), to marry a woman. So, Ayak o is asking quite surprisedly if Sean is proposing to marry her.

Sean says, “Yes, and before you say anything else, I just want you to know that I've given this a lot of thought. I've thought abou t it a lot. I've been thinking about it and I'm convinced, I know for sure that we're ma de for each other.” We are made for each other. “To be made for each other” is  sort of like having a soul mate, when you are saying that this other person in  this romantic relationship is perfect for you, that you each have the characteris tics that matched, that go together, and that make you a perfect romantic coup le. Of course, there no such thing as a perfect romantic couple, but many people  do believe that their husband or wife was “made for them,” meaning they'r e perfect for them.

Ayako says, “I don’t think…” Sean interrupts her an d says, “And you just have to say the word and we could elope tomorrow if you wan ted to.” The expression “to say the word” means indicate that you want to do so mething or the time that you want something done. “You say the word and I will t ake you to Venice Beach, and we will go swimming.” That means whenever you w ant to, you just tell me and I will do it. That’s what Sean is saying here t o our poor Ayako. Sean says, “We could elope tomorrow.” To “elope” (elope) means  to go and get married in secret. You don’t tell any of your family or your f riends, you just go somewhere. Here in the United States, people often go to Las V egas because it's easy, I guess, to get married there. They have lots of plac es to get married and you'll get married without telling any of your friends and fam ily. That is to elope. Sean is saying that if Ayako wants to, they can go and get married today, tomorrow. They could elope suddenly, without having any sort of we dding or celebration.

Ayako says, “Elope?!” Sean says, “Or, if you prefer , if you want, we can have a lavish wedding.” He’s saying okay, well if you don’ t want to elope, we can also have a very expensive, fancy, elegant wedding cerem ony. That’s what lavish means, something that usually costs a lot of money.  “I'm not picky,” Sean says, meaning it doesn’t matter to me. I'm not going to b e mad one way or the other. He can do whatever Ayako wants. “I just want us to be husband and wife” – to be married.

Ayako says, “Sean, you're a really nice guy, but do n’t you think you might be jumping the gun?” To “jump the gun” means to do som ething too soon, before it's the right time, to do something perhaps before some thing is completed. So, if you invite everyone to a party and you haven’t asked yo ur husband or wife if they can come over to your house, you probably jumped the gu n. You’ve done something that you should have waited to do until you were su re of, or certain of, other things. The expression probably comes from track. T hat is when people race to see who’s fastest. Usually the race begins by shoot ing a gun in the air. “To jump the gun” means to start running before the gun fire s and you, of course, can't do that. That’s the whole point of having the gun, so everyone starts at the same time. Anyway, back to our story.

Ayako thinks that Sean is jumping the gun. Sean say s, “No. You know what they say: When it's right, it's right.” This is a phrase  that Sean uses to defend his decision. He’s saying that when it's the right time , you just have to do it, and now is the right time.

Ayako says, “We've only been on two dates,” meaning  they’ve only gone out romantically somewhere as a couple or gotten togeth er twice, two dates. A “date” is a romantic appointment, dinner and a movie, that  sort of thing.

Sean says, “Yes, but they have been the best two da tes of my life.” Well, even if they were the best two dates of his life, we would probably agree that Sean is jumping the gun in asking this woman to marry him.

[start of dialogue]

Sean:  By now, I think you know how I feel about yo u. I’m madly in love with you and I believe in my heart of hearts that you’re my soul mate.

Ayako:  That’s really sweet of you to say.

Sean:  And because I feel the way I do, I would lik e to ask you a very important question.

Ayako:  Okay, but why are you getting down on one k nee?

Sean:  Ayako, would you marry me?

Ayako:  Marry you?! Is this a marriage proposal?

Sean:  Yes, and before you say anything else, I jus t want you to know that I’ve given this a lot of thought and I’m convinced that we’re made for each other.

Ayako:  I don’t think...

Sean:  And you just have to say the word and we cou ld elope tomorrow, if you wanted to.

Ayako:  Elope?!

Sean:  Or, if you prefer, we can have a lavish wedd ing. I’m not picky. I just want us to be husband and wife.

Ayako:  Sean, you’re a really nice guy, but don’t y ou think you might be jumping the gun?

Sean:  No. You know what they say: “When it’s right , it’s right.”

Ayako:  We’ve only been on two dates!

Sean:  Yes, but they have been the best two dates o f my life!

# Asking for Time Off

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 808: Asking for Time Off.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  808. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode like all of our episodes has a Learnin g Guide and that Learning Guide can be found on our website eslpod.com. Go th ere, become a member, and download the Learning Guide.

This episode is a dialogue between Johnny and Franc esca about asking for time off, time where you don’t have to work. Let's get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Johnny:  I just found out that the manager is letti ng Neal take Friday off. I asked him two days ago for Friday off and he turned me do wn!

Francesca:  Neal’s wife is pregnant, so maybe he ne eds time off to go with her to a doctor’s visit, or something.

Johnny:  That’s so messed up! I asked first, so I s hould have been given permission instead of Neal. I think the manager has  it in for me.

Francesca:  I don’t think that’s the case. Maybe ne xt time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say “yes.” Neal does have s eniority, you know.

Johnny:  Neal is always going to have seniority ove r me and I’m always going to get screwed.

Francesca:  Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about  this. Neal put in his years and earned his seniority fair and square. When you’ ve worked here 18 years, you’ll get priority over newer hires.

Johnny:  If I’m still in this job in 17 years, shoo t me!

[end of dialogue]

Johnny begins by saying to Francesca, “I just found  out (I just learned) that the manager is letting or allowing Neal to take Friday off.” “To take a day off” or to take a week off or a month off here is phrasal verb  meaning not to go to work on that day or for that week or for that month. I'm go ing to take the afternoon off. That means I'm not going to work after lunch. Maybe  I won't work before lunch either. I don’t know. That’s what we mean by to tak e something off. That same phrasal verb to take off can also mean to remove yo ur clothing. “I'm going to take off my shirt” – not really, not in front of the mic rophone here! So, to take off means to remove something you are wearing. To take off can also be used for a plane that leaves the ground. “What time does the p lane take off?” What time does it leave? In this dialogue, though, “to take o ff” means simply to not go to work.

Johnny says, “I asked him (the manager) two days ag o for Friday off and he turned me down.” To “turn down someone” or to “turn  someone down” is another phrasal verb that means to say “no” to something so meone has asked you to do, or that someone has asked you for. “I'm going to tu rn down his request for a vacation next week.” I'm going to say no. To turn d own is usually a verb we use when someone has authority over you, when they're h igher up, have a higher position than you, and usually in a somewhat more f ormal situation. But you could have a parent turn down their son’s request f or the car on Friday night. It's possible to say that as well.

Francesca says, “Neal’s wife” – Neal is the one who  is getting Friday off – “is pregnant, so maybe he needs time off to go with her  to a doctor’s visit, or something.” “Time off” is a period of time when you  are not working, when you do not have to go to work. So, you could say to your b oss, “I need some time off this afternoon” and your boss might say, “Okay, take thi s afternoon off.” “Time off” is a noun and “to take off,” of course, is a verb.

Johnny says, “That’s so messed up!” The expression to be “messed” (messed) up is sort of an informal expression to mean it's n ot fair or it's not right. Sometimes perhaps it's just simply confusing. Here Johnny means it's not fair. It's not right. He says, “I asked first, so I should hav e been given permission instead of Neal.” “I should have been given permission.” Wh en we say you should have been something that means that it didn’t actually h appen, but you think that in a perfect world, it should have happened. “Permission ” is authorization. It's when someone in authority, your boss, a parent, a teache r says, “Okay, you can do that.” It is saying it's all right for you to do so mething. Johnny says, “I think the manager has it in for me.” “To have it in for” some one means you want to do something to someone that will make their life mise rable or difficult because you dislike this person. Students often think their tea chers are mean, are not nice,

that they have it in for them, that they're trying to purposely make their life difficult.

Francesca says, “I don’t think that’s the case.” the “case” (case) here means the situation or the circumstances, the way something i s: “I don’t think that’s the case.” It means I don’t think that’s what is actual ly going on here, I don’t think that is really the situation. Francesca says, “Maybe nex t time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say yes.” To do something “ in advance” means before something else happens, ahead of time, before perha ps other people do it or before something else is supposed to happen. For ex ample, nowadays in the United States, you can buy your movie tickets in ad vance. So, let's say I want to go see a movie this Friday night with my wife and I  decide, hmm, it might be very busy. Sometimes it's so busy you go to the movie th eater and there are no more tickets left. So, I'm going to buy them in advance.  I'm going to go on the Internet and I'm going to buy the tickets today for a movie we're going to see on Friday. That’s just an example. I'm not actually taking my wife to a movie on Friday. I really don’t like going to see movies in movie thea ters. I don’t know if I've ever told you that, but just all the people and they're talking on their cellphones and… just, I would rather just watch a movie on my telev ision honestly. So, that’s me.

Anyway, Francesca says, “Neal does have seniority, you know.” “Seniority” (seniority) means you usually have been at the comp any for a longer time. I've been working for the company for 10 years. You’ve b een working for the company for one year. I have seniority over you, we  might say. I have been with the company longer. And usually at a company or an organization that means that you have perhaps more power or more influence than people who are younger than you or, not younger in age, but have b een at the company fewer years than you have.

Johnny says, “Neal is always going to have seniorit y over me and I'm always going to get screwed.” To get “screwed” (screwed) m eans that someone treats you unfairly, that you get a bad result, that someo ne does something bad to you. “Screwed” is a very strong word. It's an informal t erm – many people would probably consider it still a little vulgar, a littl e dirty, so you definitely don’t want to use this with anyone other than your family. I usua lly don’t use this word. It's a pretty strong word. It's definitely not something t o use with your children or with your boss or with anyone that you're not very close  friends with.

Francesca says, “Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about this.” To get or have a “chip” (chip) on your “shoulder” (shoulder) means t o continue to think about something bad or unfair that has happened to you in  the past and it still affects you in a negative way. Someone was not nice to you two months ago and so

every time you see that person, you're sort of angr y with them. You're not very nice with them. Some people might say you have a ch ip on your shoulder because that person wasn’t nice to you.

Francesca says, “Neal put in his years and earned h is seniority fair and square.” “To put in your years” means to do something for a long period of time in order to get some sort of benefit, some sort of advantage. “ Fair and square” means in an honest, fair way, in a truthful way, not trying to trick anyone, not trying to do anything that would be considered cheating or untru thful. Francesca says, “When you’ve worked here 18 years, you'll get priority ov er new hires.” “Priority” means that something is more important than other things or than something else. If you say this has priority over that, you mean that this  is more important than that. So, when Francesca says that Johnny will have priority over someone, she means that just like Neal, he will have seniority over th em and therefore get things before they do. Francesca says Johnny will have pri ority over new “hires” (hires). A hire is a person who is given a job. So, a new hi re is someone who has recently been given a job in your company or organi zation.

Johnny says, “If I'm still in this job in 17 years,  shoot me!” “If I'm still in this job” means if I'm still working here at this same job in  17 years, Johnny says, “shoot me.” “Shoot me” literally means you're asking someo ne to kill you, to take a gun and point it at you and shoot you. But we use this expression jokingly, sarcastically perhaps, when there's some very unple asant situation that you are in, something very undesirable. So, let's say I los e my job and my cat died. Well, that’s not a bad thing, but let's say my cat died a nd I'm sad and I lost my job and I don’t have any money and I'm telling all this to a friend of mine and I say to my friend, “Oh, just shoot me!” meaning just kill me b ecause my life is so difficult. But we don’t mean it seriously.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Johnny:  I just found out that the manager is letti ng Neal take Friday off. I asked him two days ago for Friday off and he turned me do wn!

Francesca:  Neal’s wife is pregnant, so maybe he ne eds time off to go with her to a doctor’s visit, or something.

Johnny:  That’s so messed up! I asked first, so I s hould have been given permission instead of Neal. I think the manager has  it in for me.

Francesca:  I don’t think that’s the case. Maybe ne xt time, if you ask a couple of weeks in advance, he’ll say “yes.” Neal does have s eniority, you know.

Johnny:  Neal is always going to have seniority ove r me and I’m always going to get screwed.

Francesca:  Don’t get a chip on your shoulder about  this. Neal put in his years and earned his seniority fair and square. When you’ ve worked here 18 years, you’ll get priority over newer hires.

Johnny:  If I’m still in this job in 17 years, shoo t me!

Colleen and Jerry are listening to the radio. Colle en says to Jerry, “Shh!” This is when you want someone to be quiet, of course. You g o “Shh!” “I want to hear the weather forecast for this week.” The “weather forec ast” is a prediction about what the weather will be like tomorrow, the day after to morrow, the day after that, the entire week, usually for (maybe) five to seven days  in advance.

Jerry says, “What's so important about this week?” But Colleen doesn’t answer him. She just says, “Shh, ” telling him to be quiet , to stop talking. My wife does that to me a lot, too. Maybe I'm talking too much –  no, no, it can't be possible.

The radio announcer says, “Tomorrow, this warm fron t will move out and a cold front will move in.” A warm “front” (front) is a la rge area of warm air that moves toward another area with cold air. So, when we're t alking about the weather, a warm front would bring warmer temperatures to where  you are living. A cold front is the opposite. A cold front is a large amount of cold air that moves into a certain area or place. The radio announcer says that the co ld front is “moving in.” In other words, that’s what's coming in the future. the warm front is “moving out” – it’s going away. This means the temperatures will b e colder. It also means, the radio announcer says, that there will be windy cond itions with a chance of thunderstorms. “Windy” (windy) is when the air move s very quickly, when the air moves at very high speeds. “Thunderstorms” is a wea ther event where there are lots of dark clouds and rain and lightning (which a re flashes of light) in the sky and thunder. “Thunder” is that low noise that you h ear after you see the lightning – that’s a thunderstorm. Where I grew up in Minneso ta, there are lots of thunderstorms in the summertime. In fact, I was bac k visiting not too long ago and there was a thunderstorm the first day I came. Maybe they were trying to tell something, like I shouldn’t go back to Minnesota to  visit? I don’t know.

 Colleen, after hearing the radio announcer’s foreca st, says, “Yeah!” She’s happy, which is kind of strange that you're happy if there 's going to be thunderstorms. The radio announcer continues, “On Tuesday, things will clear up in the morning and we'll have sunny skies.” To “clear up” is a two -word phrasal verb that here means for the clouds to go away. So, instead of hav ing clouds in the sky, it becomes sunny. Normally that would be a good thing.  Sunny is when you have lots of sunshine, when you can see the sun.

But Colleen says, “Uh!” She seems disappointed at t his news, again, a little strange. The radio announcer continues, “But it wil l be chilly in the afternoon and the skies will be overcast. “Chilly” (chilly) is an  adjective meaning cool or cold, not warm. “It's a little chilly outside” usually means it's not cold. It's not so cold you're going to freeze, but you might need a jacket or a s weater, something to keep you warm. “Chile” (Chile) is – well, it's a country in South America, and “chili” (chili) is a food that you can eat. You can eat chilly chili i n Chile. We used to say stuff like that when we were kids, same pronunciation, three d ifferent spellings. Isn't English wonderful?

The radio announcer continues that the skies will b e overcast. “Overcast” (overcast) means there are lots of clouds in the sk y, usually gray clouds. It's not sunny. It's not thunderstorms. It's not raining usu ally, but when we say it's overcast, we mean it's cloudy. There isn't a lot of  sunshine. The announcer says, “There’ll be a chance of precipitation in the eveni ng with very high levels of humidity.” “Precipitation” is just another word for  liquid coming from the sky, either rain or snow or some sort of liquid that is falling out of the clouds. That’s precipitation. In the United States, when you are l istening to a weather forecast, they may talk about how much precipitation there wa s and that will be measured in inches. So, they might say, “We had an inch of r ain last night.” That means that if you put a little glass outside and you let the water fall in it, there would have been one, approximately one inch of water that  would have fallen. That’s how we measure precipitation in English – well, in the United States we use inches, of course.

The announcer also says there's going to be high le vels or a lot of humidity. “Humidity” (humidity) is a way of measuring the wat er that’s in the air before it comes to the ground. It's really an expression of w hat we call “water vapor” in the air. If it's very humid out, for example you're in Florida in the summertime or in the Caribbean or by the ocean and it's very hot, th ere's often a lot of humidity. It feels like there's water in the air even when it's not raining. Colleen is happy with the forecast of precipitation and high humidity.

The radio announcer then continues, “On Friday, the  temperature will drop sharply and we'll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.”  The “temperature,” of course, is a measurement of how hot or cold something is. I n the United States, we use the Fahrenheit scale. In most other places in the w orld, the Celsius scale is used. When we say something will “drop,” we mean it will decrease. “Sharply” means suddenly and dramatically – a long way. When we say  the “temperature will drop sharply,” we mean maybe 50 degrees this morning and  then this afternoon it will be only 30 degrees or 20 degrees. That would be to drop sharply. Sharply has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for those. The announcer says, “We’ll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.” “To reach” means for the temperature to get up to a certain point, i n this case 20 degrees. Degrees, of course, is the way that we measure, the unit tha t we measure and express temperature, both in Fahrenheit and Celsius. Collee n again is happy. She says, “Oh, yeah!”

Jerry says, “What was all that about?” Why were you  getting happy, basically, when the weather was going to be bad or the forecas t said it was going to be bad? Colleen says, “If the weather is nice this wee kend, my in-laws plan to drive up to spend a few days at our house.” My “in-laws” are either your father-in-law or your mother-in-law, usually both of them. They'r e the father and mother of your husband or your wife, the parents of your spouse. S o, if you're married, you have in-laws. You have a father-in-law and a mother-in-l aw. I have a father-in-law and a mother-in-law. My wife has a father-in-law and a mother-in-law. Those are my parents. And of course, my in-laws are her parents.  I can make a lot of joke about in-laws at this point, but I won't.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Colleen:  Shh! I want to hear the weather forecast for this week.

Jerry:  What’s so important about this week?

Colleen:  Shh!

Radio Announcer:  Tomorrow, this warm front will mo ve out and a cold front will move in, bringing with it windy conditions with a c hance of thunderstorms.

Colleen:  Yeah!

Radio Announcer:  On Tuesday, things will clear up in the morning and we’ll have sunny skies...

Colleen:  Uh!

Radio Announcer:  But it will be chilly in the afte rnoon and the skies will be overcast. There’ll be a chance of precipitation in the evening, with very high levels of humidity.

Colleen:  Yeah!

Radio Announcer:  On Friday, the temperature will d rop sharply and we’ll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.

Colleen:  Oh, yeah!

Jerry:  What was all that about?

Colleen:  If the weather is nice this weekend, my i n-laws plan to drive up to spend a few days at our house.

Jerry:  [laughs] Oh, I see.

# Switching Cell Phone Plans

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 810: Switching Cell Phone Plans.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 810. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Just six letters – “eslp od” (eslpod) – well, a dot and then “com,” of course. Go there, become a member, d ownload the Learning Guide, and improve your English as fast as possible .

This episode is a dialogue about cell phone. These are cellular or mobile phones. We're talking about the plans that you get from the  phone company. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paul:  I need a new cell phone plan. These roaming and overage charges are killing me!

Shauna:  I thought you had a good calling, messagin g, and data plan.

Paul:  I do, but I’m still going over each month.

Shauna:  Have you thought about a prepaid plan? You ’ll never be charged extra.

Paul:  That’s not an option. I think I need an unli mited plan.

Shauna:  Okay, but I don’t understand. Why do you h ave roaming charges? Doesn’t your carrier have good coverage all over the country?

Paul:  I’ve been taking trips to Mexico to see my n ew girlfriend and the coverage doesn’t extend to Mexico.

Shauna:  Oh, I see. And the overage charges?

Paul:  When you’re in a long-distance relationship,  you have to do a lot of calling and texting, not to mention updating social media w ebsites to stay in touch. I keep exceeding my allotted 5000 minutes of calling time and 100 megabytes of data.

 Shauna:  What?! To exceed that, you’d have to be on  the phone all the time!

Paul:  Not all the time, but I’m talking to her now . Do you want to say “hi”?

Shauna:  You’ve been on the phone with her the enti re time we’ve been having this conversation?

Paul:  How else can we keep up on everything that’s  going on in each other’s lives?

[end of dialogue]

Paul begins by saying to Shauna, “I need a new cell  phone plan,” an agreement that you sign with a telephone company about how mu ch you're going to pay for your cell phone service. Paul says, “These roaming and overage charges are killing me!” “Roaming” (roaming) refers to using yo ur cell phone outside of the normal area where the cell phone company provides a  connection to its telephone network. So, if I have a phone here in Lo s Angeles from a certain company and then I go to a different city, and let' s say my cell phone company doesn’t have any of its equipment in that city, I c ould still use my cell phone, but I would have roaming charges. I would have to be payi ng for the service that I'm using in that city because it wasn’t from my compan y.

“Overage charges” is money that you have to pay bec ause you used more minutes than are in your plan. Most cell phone plan s in the United States give you so many minutes a month. Let's say it's 500 min utes or 250 minutes. After you talk for that long in one month, you have to pa y extra for each minute. That extra amount is your overage. “Charges” of course j ust refers to money you have to pay. Paul says the overage charges are “killing him.” He doesn’t mean they're actually killing him. That’s just an expression. Wh en you say something as “killing you,” you mean it's bothering you, it's hurting you , it's something that is having a bad effect on you.

Shauna says, “I thought you had a good calling, mes saging, and data plan.” It used to be, when cell phones first began, that the only thing you could do was talk on them, just like on a regular telephone. Now , of course, you can also send text messages and with the wonderful world of the I nternet, you can also get on the Internet with your phone – not all phones, but many phones. So, “messaging” is text messaging, sending messages to another phon e with your phone. “Data” refers to Internet connection with your phone.

Paul says, “I do – I do have a good plan, but I'm s till going over each month.” “To go over” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means  to exceed, to use more than what you are supposed to, to use more than the maxi mum amount. So, if I have 250 minutes of calling on my cell phone and I call 300 minutes, I've “gone over,” I have used more than my maximum. “To go over” can al so mean to review, to look at carefully: “I want to go over these plans w ith you.” But here in the dialogue, it means to exceed, to go more than the m aximum. People might say I don’t want to go over my “limit.” It could be a lim it for other things, too. I have a limited number of girlfriends. My limit is three. I  can't have more than three girlfriends. I'm just kidding, of course. I don’t h ave girlfriends. You understand the idea though. Paul says that he’s going over his lim its each month for minutes, not girlfriends – not even sure if Paul has a girlfrien d!

Shauna says, “Have you thought about a prepaid plan ?” “Prepaid” (prepaid) is when you pay for something in advance, before you a ctually use it. A prepaid plan, when we're talking about a cell phone, is whe n you often buy like a card and you use the card to add minutes to your phone, and when those minutes are up, that’s it. You don’t have the company send you a bill every month. You can only use the number of minutes that you buy and aft er that’s gone, after you have completed those or finished those minutes, then you  can't talk anymore. You’d have to buy another card. That’s a prepaid plan. Sh auna says, “If you do that, you'll never be charged extra.”

Paul says, “That’s not an option. I need an unlimit ed plan.” Unlimited means not limited, without limits, without a maximum value, s o you don’t have 500-minute limit. You don’t have any limit. You can talk for a  million minutes if you want. You won't have a lot of time to do much else, especiall y if you have three girlfriends. Paul wants an unlimited plan.

Shauna says, “Okay, but I don’t understand. Why do you have roaming charges? Doesn’t your carrier have good coverage all over the country?” A “carrier” (carrier) here refers to the telephone company that  provides you your phone service. That’s a carrier. Carrier can have other m eanings in English, as can the word roam, we mentioned earlier. Check out our Lear ning Guide for additional definitions of those terms. “Coverage” (coverage) i s a measurement of the geographic or physical area that you can use with y our cell phone carrier, so when we say a carrier has good coverage, we mean th at there are lots of different areas where you can use their service.

Paul says, “I've been taking trips to Mexico.” Why?  “To see my new girlfriend.” Notice he says new girlfriend. Obviously, he has ot her girlfriends. See! I told you! Paul is going to Mexico to see his new girlfriend a nd the coverage doesn’t extend

to Mexico. “Extend to” means go as far as or simply  to include, and that’s actually pretty common. Most cell phone companies don’t exte nd their coverage to other countries.

Shauna says, “Oh, I see. And the overage charges?” Paul says, “When you're in a long distance relationship,” that is, if you live  in one place and your boyfriend or girlfriend lives in a different city or a different  country, “you have to do a lot of calling and texting.” “Texting” is text messaging w e talked about earlier. “…not to mention (or in addition to) updating social media w ebsites to stay in touch.” So because Paul’s girlfriend is so far away, he has to  call her a lot, he has to text her a lot, and he has to update his social media sites.  “Social media” would be things like Facebook and Twitter. Paul says, “I keep excee ding (or going over) my allotted 5000 minutes of calling time.” My “allotte d” (allotted) means my assigned or my given. “Your allotted minutes” are the minute s that you are given by the telephone company. Paul has 5000 minutes – 5000 min utes! That’s a lot of time, Paul. He also has 100 megabytes of data. Well, that ’s not very much data. A “megabyte” is a way of measuring how much informati on, electronic information if you will, is passed up and down to an Internet conn ection, and 100 megabytes is not very much.

Shauna says, “What?! To exceed that” – and she’s ta lking now about the 5000 minutes of calling time – “ you’d have to be on the  phone all the time!” Paul says, “Not all the time, but I'm talking to her now. Do y ou want to say ‘hi’?” Shauna says, “You’ve been on the phone with her the entire  time we have been having this conversation?” So, Paul is talking to Shauna a bout this issue, and his girlfriend is on the phone right now from Mexico. W hat kind of idiot is Paul? I mean, seriously. Well, maybe not so stupid – I mean , he has more than one girlfriend, you know.

Paul says, “How else (in what other way) can we kee p up on everything that’s going on in each other’s lives?” To “keep up on” so mething is to be aware of what is happening, to know the most recent informat ion about something, especially something that might be changing quickly .

Now, let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paul:  I need a new cell phone plan. These roaming and overage charges are killing me!

Shauna:  I thought you had a good calling, messagin g, and data plan.

 Paul:  I do, but I’m still going over each month.

Shauna:  Have you thought about a prepaid plan? You ’ll never be charged extra.

This episode is a dialogue between Lew and Alexa wh o are watching a sports game. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lew:  Boo!! Boo!! Your team sucks!

Alexa:  Sit down and stop heckling the visiting tea m. You’re making a fool of yourself.

Lew:  I’m supporting our team. If I keep taunting t he players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we’ll gain an  advantage.

Alexa:  If you keep this up, we’ll get kicked out o f this stadium.

Lew:  We won’t get kicked out. Get into the spirit of the game and start yelling at the other team with me. Hey, it’s working! Look at that pathetic attempt to score. You guys are a bunch of babies!

Alexa:  Stop that! Look, security is coming this wa y.

Lew:  They just want to catch a glimpse of the pers on who has the guts to stand up for our team. Whoo! Whoo!

Alexa:  If anyone asks, I don’t know you.

[end of dialogue]

Lew begins our dialogue by saying, “Boo!! Boo!! You r team sucks!” Lew is at a sports game and he’s yelling at the other team. Thi s is something of course that some sports fans like to do. When they go to a game , they like to yell at the opposing or opposite team, the team that is not you r team. “Boo” is a word that we yell loudly when we want to show our disapproval  or dislike of some sports team. It could also be in some other sort of perfor mance. It could even be in a musical or theatrical performance, in a theater. Le w says, “Your team sucks.” This verb to “suck” is a rather rude, informal word  meaning to be very bad at something or to be terrible. It's a very negative w ay of describing someone. If you say “This sucks!”, you mean this is terrible. This is awful. It's a pretty strong word, not a vulgar word, but certainly one that you would n’t want to use in a business meeting.

Alexa says, “Sit down and stop heckling the visitin g team. You're making a fool of yourself.” Alexa is telling Lew to sit down and to stop heckling. To “heckle” (heckle) means to make rude comments, unkind commen ts interrupting someone when they're speaking or when they're performing, s o if you are going to a performance of a comedian and the comedian is telli ng jokes and you don’t like the comedian, you may yell things back at him or he r, insulting him or her. That would be heckling. Well, that’s what Lew is doing. He’s heckling the visiting team, the sports team that has come from somewhere else t o play where your sports team normally plays. Alexa says that Lew is making a fool of himself. To “make a fool of yourself” is to do something that makes you  look stupid, that other people look at and laugh at.

Lew says, “I'm supporting our team (I'm trying to h elp our team). If I keep taunting the players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we'll gain an advantage.” To “taunt” (taunt) means to say somethi ng that is mean, something that is rude, trying to get someone to react to you , trying to get you to get mad. We might also use the verb to “tease” (tease). Well , Lew thinks that he’s taunting the players on the other team, the visiting team, s o that if he does, they will lose their concentration. Your concentration is your abi lity to focus, to think about only one thing and ignore all the other things. To “lose  your concentration” means to not be able to do that. Lew thinks that his tauntin g will give his team an advantage, that they’ll gain an advantage. To “gain  an advantage” is to do something that will give you a better position or b etter situation, so that you are more likely to, in this case, win.

Alexa says, “If you keep this up, we'll get kicked out of this stadium.” To “keep something up” or to “keep up something” here means to continue to do something, especially something that is difficult o r challenging. “To keep up” can also have other meanings in English and those can b e found in our Learning

Guide. Alexa says to Lew that if he keeps up his he ckling, they will get kicked out of the stadium. To “get kicked out” means forced to  leave a place even though you want to stay there, so if you go to a restauran t and you start yelling at people and screaming and swearing, the owner will probably  kick you out. He will say, “Hey, you get out of here! You can't stay here.” Th at’s to be kicked out. Sometimes bars, places that serve alcohol, have spe cial people that will kick you out, that will remove you physically if you cause p roblems. They're called “bouncers”. Well, Alexa is afraid they will get kic ked out of the “stadium” (stadium).

A stadium could also be called an “arena” (arena). Basically, it's a large building usually without a roof on the top that has a lot of  seats, around often in a circle, could be in a square, but usually in a circular for mation that is watching some sort of sports game in the middle of the stadium. Y ou could have a baseball stadium. You could have a football stadium. Many ci ties have separate stadiums for football and baseball. Some just have one. Some  stadiums are also used for rock concerts because often you can put 20,000 or 5 0,000, sometimes as many as 100,000 or 150,000 in a single stadium. I believ e the Los Angeles Coliseum can hold about 110,000 people. The Coliseum is an e xample of a stadium.

Lew says, “We won't get kicked out. Get into the sp irit of the game,” he tells her “and start yelling at the other team with me.” To “ get into the spirit of something” means to do what other people are doing, to have the same excitement and enthusiasm as they have. To “yell” (yell) means to shout, to speak in a very loud voice. Lew says, “Hey, it's working” meaning he’s h eckling is working. “Look at that pathetic attempt to score.” “Pathetic” (pathet ic) here means very sad or miserable, terrible. To “score” means to earn a poi nt in a game. In baseball, you can score if you hit the ball out of the ballpark, what's called the homerun. In American football, you score when you take the ball , one of your players and you run across what's called the goal line. Lew again y elling at the other team says, “You guys are a bunch of babies!

Alexa says, “Stop that! Look, security is coming th is way.” Alexa is telling Lew that the security officers, the people whose job it  is to keep the stadium safe and secure and to be not crazy. They're coming this way . They're coming toward Alexa and Lew.

Lew says, “They just want to catch a glimpse of the  person who has the guts to stand up for our team.” The phrase to catch a “glim pse” (glimpse) means to see something for a very brief moment, very quickly. In  this case, Lew is saying that the security guards want to come over and see him b ecause he has the guts to stand up for his team. “Guts” (guts) here means cou rage, bravery, the willingness

to do something difficult when it is a perhaps scar y or frightening situation. To “stand up for something” means to defend or protect  someone who is perhaps being attacked or in a difficult place or situation . Well, of course, we don’t think Lew is correct. The security guards are probably no t interested in catching a glimpse of him because he has guts.

Alexa says, “If anyone asks, I don’t know you.” She ’s saying she doesn’t want to be associated with Lew. Lew’s probably had a little  bit too much beer during the game. That happens in American stadiums. Sometimes people drink a little too much and then they start yelling. Of course, if you ’ve watched the soccer match in some countries, you know exactly what I'm talkin g about.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lew:  Boo!! Boo!! Your team sucks!

Alexa:  Sit down and stop heckling the visiting tea m. You’re making a fool of yourself.

Lew:  I’m supporting our team. If I keep taunting t he players on the other team, they may lose their concentration and we’ll gain an  advantage.

Alexa:  If you keep this up, we’ll get kicked out o f this stadium.

Lew:  We won’t get kicked out. Get into the spirit of the game and start yelling at the other team with me. Hey, it’s working! Look at that pathetic attempt to score. You guys are a bunch of babies!

Alexa:  Stop that! Look, security is coming this wa y.

Lew:  They just want to catch a glimpse of the pers on who has the guts to stand up for our team. Whoo! Whoo!

# Losing Employees to Other Companies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 812: Losing Employees to Other Companies.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 812. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, United States of America.  Our website is eslpod.com. You know that, of course. You also know that if you become a member of ESL Podcast, you can download a Learning Guide. That Learning Guide is your key to better English. It's the way of improving your English faster than anything else.  Our dialogue is about when someone who works for a company gets hired by another company and leaves. This happens all the time especially to good employees. Let's get started.  [start of dialogue]  Diego:  That’s three in six months!  Natalie:  What’s three in six months?  Diego:  That’s three of this company’s employees who have been hired away by other companies. First, there was Lamar. I wasn’t surprised that headhunters were interested in Lamar, since he was clearly a rising star.  Natalie:  Yeah, Lamar was a tough loss. His unique set of skills is hard to duplicate.  Diego:  You’re telling me! We haven’t been able to find a replacement. After Lamar, there was Sariah. Sariah is a classic case of brain drain. There are great jobs in McQuillanland, with lucrative pay and a low cost of living. I’m not surprised Sariah took that job.  Natalie:  Sariah was very talented. We couldn’t match the offer she received and she took the better deal.  Diego:  And today, Melinda tells me that she’s probably going to accept an offer from a startup that’s made her an offer she can’t refuse. # Doing Basic Exercises

Jane:  I’ve just had the best workout at the gym!

Arnold:  You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise.  I exercise right here in my apartment.

Jane:  Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small spac e?

Arnold:  Nearly everything I need to do. Before I d o my calisthenics, I stretch. And every morning I do sit-ups, push-ups, and pull- ups.

Jane:  That’s not enough to keep you in shape.

Arnold:  I’m not finished. Every other day I do lun ges and squats, and I lift free weights.

Jane:  But what about a cardio workout?

Arnold:  I do jumping jacks, run in place, and jump  rope on the balcony.

Jane:  I guess you’ve got it all figured out.

Arnold:  I think so. Have you seen the light? Are y ou going to stop going to the gym?

Jane:  No way! Exercise isn’t the only reason I go to the gym, you know. I go for the view.

Arnold:  I have a feeling you’re not talking about the view outside.

Jane:  You’ve got that right!

[end of dialogue]

Jane – no relation to Jane Fonda, who was a famous actress and activist, political activist, in the United States, she’s sti ll alive. She became famous also for doing these tapes, these video tapes, of how to  exercise, but this is a different Jane. Jane says, “I've just had the best workout at  the the gym.” A “workout,” one word, is a period of exercise, a period of time tha t you use your body in such a way as to physically challenge it so you can improv e your strength, your health and so forth. The “gym” (gym) is a place where you go to do exercises. Gym is short for the longer word, “gymnasium.” Don’t confu se the spelling of “gym” (gym) with the name “Jim,” which comes from James. That’s  spelled (Jim). And both of them are different from “gin” (gin) which is an alc oholic drink that I'll be having when I finish this episode.

Arnold says – and this is not Arnold Schwarzenegger , the former governor of California, completely different Arnold! – Arnold s ays, “You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise.” To “exercise” is the verb we use for using your body in a way that will help it physically, so when you do a work out or go and “work out” (as a verb), you are going to exercise. Arnold says, “I e xercise right here in my apartment.”

Jane says, “Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small  space?” Jane doesn’t quite believe that Arnold can exercise in his apartment. Arnold says, “Nearly everything I need to do.” “I can do everything I ne ed to do,” he says. He says, “Before I do my calisthenics (calisthenics)” – is, like gymnasium, originally from a Greek word – calisthenics are exercises that improv e your strength and your flexibility, but they don’t require any typically s pecial equipment. They're basically just moving your body and doing things with your bo dy that could be done anywhere. To “stretch” (stretch) means to move your  body in ways that push or pull parts of it so that it helps you with, they sa y, your flexibility. You're able to move your muscles more easily if you stretch. That’ s what I'm told.

Arnold says, “And every morning I do sit-ups, push- ups, and pull-ups.” A “sit-up” is an exercise where you lie down on the ground wit h your back against the ground, you put your head on the ground, you put yo ur hands either behind your

head or on the side of your head, and then you sit up from that position, either with your knees up (your legs up), or your body fla t. A “push-up” (push-up) is an exercise where you're lying on the ground, but you' re lying on your stomach, this time with your face forward. Then you put your two hands flat on the floor and you push up with your arms and you raise your body up. “Pull-ups” (pull-ups) are exercises that involve having a bar, usually a meta l bar (it could be a thick wooden one), and you grab onto it with your hands ( so you're below the bar, typically), and you grab onto it with your hands ,a nd you pull your whole body up using your arms to do so. So, we have sit-ups, push -ups and pull-ups.

Jane says, “That’s not enough to keep you in shape. ” To be “in shape” means to be physically in good condition. We might say physi cally “fit” (fit). Arnold then says, “I'm not finished. Every other day I do lunge s and squats, and I lift free weights. A “lunge” (lunge) is an exercise that is d one by standing with your two legs apart, one in front of the other, and then you  bend one knee or you walk forward bending your knees as you go far down. A “s quat” is an exercise where your two feet, you're on your feet, but your two fe et are parallel. Your legs are parallel. You don’t have one in front of the other.  You then bend your knees so that your butt, your bottom, is almost touching you r feet and then you stand up again. Often people put weight on their shoulders t o make the squat more difficult. It's very good for your leg muscles. Arn old says he also “lifts free weights.” To “lift something” is to take it in your  hand and lift it up in the air. “Lifting weights” means going and taking very heavy  objects and moving them up and down with your arms or legs. Free weights are w eights that are not attached to any machine. It used to be that all weight lifti ng was free weight lifting. Now, they have different machines that you can lift weig hts with.

Jane says, “But what about a cardio workout?” “Card io” (cardio) comes from cardiovascular. It refers to your heart. A cardio w orkout is one such as riding a bike, running, jogging, walking quickly, where you get your heart rate up. Your heart starts to beat much faster. That’s a cardio w orkout. Arnold says for his cardio, he does jumping jacks. “Jumping jacks” whic h used to be very popular during the middle of the 20 th  Century in the ‘50s and ‘60s and ‘70s – I don’t kn ow how popular they are now in schools – but a jumping  jack is where you stand with your feet together and then you jump up, and y ou put your two feet at a distance from each other. You separate them. You ta ke your two arms and you raise them above your head, often clapping your han ds above your head, and you do all this quickly. And that’s a jumping jack.  It's kind of funny, you can see kids do this. It's an exercise that used to be very  popular in grade schools for young children.

Well, Arnold is no child, but he does jumping jacks . He also runs in place and jumps rope on his balcony. To “run in place” means not to move. You go through the motion of running, but you're not going anywher e. You're standing in one place. To “jump rope” is to take a long piece of ro pe and hold each end in each hand, you then swing it or move it in a circle so t hat it goes under your feet and then over your head, and you continue to do that an d, of course, in order for it to go under your feet, you have to jump up, and that’s  why we call it “jumping” rope.

Jane says, “I guess you’ve got it all figured out.”  I guess you understand it all. Arnold says, “I think so.” Then he asks Jane, “Have  you seen the light? Are you going to stop going to the gym.” The expression “to  see the light” means to understand something. Usually, you come to this und erstanding quickly or suddenly. It's often about something very important  in your life. Sometimes people use this expression for people who have reli gious conversions, so it's a serious, deep change in your thoughts and your beli efs. But Arnold isn't really talking about anything that serious. He’s saying to  Jane that maybe now she will see that it's not necessary to go to the gym to do exercises.

But Jane says, “No way!” No, she doesn’t agree. “Ex ercise isn't the only reason I go to the gym, you know.” She says, “I go for the v iew” – what she can see there and, of course, she can see other people, perhaps o ther attractive people. She won't see me there because I don’t go to the gym an d I'm not very attractive. (Yeah, I know, I know.)

Arnold says, “I have a feeling you're not talking a bout the view outside.” That is, he’s saying I'm guessing you're not talking about t hings you can see outside of the gym or from inside of the gym to the outside. Y ou're talking about the people in the gym. Arnold is no fool. Jane says, “You’ve g ot that right.” That expression, “you’ve got that right” means simply yes, you are a bsolutely correct.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jane:  I’ve just had the best workout at the gym!

Arnold:  You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise.  I exercise right here in my apartment.

Jane:  Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small spac e?

Arnold:  Nearly everything I need to do. Before I d o my calisthenics, I stretch. And every morning I do sit-ups, push-ups, and pull- ups.

Jane:  That’s not enough to keep you in shape.

# Getting Rid of Bugs and Rodents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 814: Getting Rid of Bugs and Rodents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 814. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between the beautiful Sh erin and an apartment manager about some problems she’s having in her apa rtment. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Apartment Manager:  This is the one-bedroom apartme nt we have for rent. Let me show you around.

Sherin:  Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a m ouse or a rat.

Apartment Manager:  There aren’t any rodents or any  other vermin in this apartment complex. I make sure of that.

Sherin:  Are you sure?

Apartment Manager:  Sure, I’m sure. Only last month , I bought some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all. This comple x is rodent-free.

Sherin:  Oh, I see.

Apartment Manager:  And the month before that, we h ad roaches, ticks, and fleas, but I fumigated and they’re gone.

Sherin:  You called a pest control company?

Apartment Manager:  I didn’t need a pest control co mpany to get rid of a few bugs. I did it myself.

Sherin:  Oh, okay.

Apartment Manager:  And six months ago, we had bedb ugs, but thanks to my diligence, they’re gone, too. So you want to see th is apartment or don’t you?

Sherin:  I think I’ll pass. This conversation is ma king my skin crawl.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the apartment manager sayi ng to Sherin, “This is the one-bedroom apartment we have for rent.” It's an ap artment with one bedroom. You can find one-bedroom apartments, two-bedroom ap artments, three-bedroom apartments, and so forth. The apartment manager say s, “Let me show you around.” Let me show you the apartment.

Sherin stops and says, “Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a mouse or a rat.” It looked like a “mouse” (mouse) or a “rat” (rat). A m ouse is a small animal. It could be white. It could be black. It could be gray. It h as fur hair on it. It has a long tail and a pointed nose. If you’ve ever seen any Disney movies, you know who Mickey Mouse is. Well, Mickey Mouse doesn’t really look exactly like a real mouse, but you get the idea. That’s a mouse. By the  way, there's a famous song about Mickey Mouse that was used for a television s how back in the oh, ‘60s and ‘70s and ‘80s that spelled Mickey Mouse’s name: [si nging] M-I-C…See you later! K-E-Y…Why? Because we love you M-O-U-S-E, Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse… and so on. Aren't you glad you know that now? Sheri n sees a mouse and a rat. A rat is a little bigger than a mouse – a little long er tail on it.

The apartment manager says, “There aren’t any roden ts or any other vermin in this apartment complex.” He says, “Oh, no, no. Ther e aren't any rodents here!” A “rodent” (rodent) is a general category that would include mice (which is the plural of mouse) and rats. “Vermin” (vermin) is a g eneral term describing any small animal or insect that people don’t like usual ly because they cause damage or they might be carrying some disease, so vermin i s a general term for any little animal or insect you don’t like. You don’t hear tha t word a lot anymore. The “apartment complex” is the building or buildings wh ere you find apartments. So the apartment manager says, “Oh no, we don’t have a ny rodents here.”

Sherin says, “Are you sure?” The apartment manager says, “Sure, I’m sure.” Yes, I am sure. “Only last month,” he says, “I boug ht some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all.” So last month, he bought a mousetrap. A “mousetrap” (mousetrap), one word, is a little devi ce, a little machine we use to catch a mouse and hold it so that we can kill it or  get rid of it. Any sort of trap for

an animal is intended to capture them, to get them,  and hold them so you can get rid of them. “Rat poison” is a chemical substance t hat will kill rats. It’ll probably also kill humans, too! To “get rid of something” me ans to no longer have it, to eliminate it, to throw it away: “I'm going to get r id of all of my old Mickey Mouse comic books.” Actually, I don’t have any Mickey Mou se comic books, but it's just an example. I do have a Mickey Mouse song. Would yo u like to hear that? No? Okay.

So the apartment manager says, “This complex is rod ent-free.” When we say something as rodent-free or drug-free or comedy-fre e, we mean it doesn’t have those things. “Rodent-free” means there's no animal  here – there are no animals, no rodents. “Drug-free” means there are no drugs. “ Comedy-free” would be – it's not very funny, kind of like this episode. Sherin s ays, “Oh, I see.” I understand.

The apartment manager then says, “And the month bef ore that, we had roaches, ticks, and fleas, but I fumigated and they're gone. ” So the apartment manager is saying no, we don’t have any of these problems here  because I killed them all. I used to have these problems. Now, two months ago, h e says, they had roaches, ticks, and fleas. A “roach” (roach) is also called a “cockroach” (cockroach), one word. A cockroach is a large insect that you will o ften find in warm, humid places. “Humid” means there's water in the air. They often are found in places that are dirty and have a lot of little pieces of food. That ’s a cockroach or a roach.

A “tick” (tick), when we're talking about an insect , is a very small insect that typically bites your skin and kind of goes into you r skin and starts to suck your blood out, kind of like a vampire but not exactly. A tick can be found in many different environments. We used to have ticks when I was back in Minnesota where there are a lot of trees, a lot of “wooded ar eas,” we would say, forests – you will find ticks that will fall onto your skin a nd then bite your skin and begin to suck your blood out - kind of like my old girlfrien d.

So the apartment manager says, “We don’t have any r oaches, ticks or fleas.” A “flea” (flea) is a small insect that can't fly, but  it does live on the skin of animals and of people. Dogs often have fleas. The apartment  manager says that he doesn’t have any of those things because he fumigat ed. To “fumigate” (fumigate) means to fill a room or an area with a dangerous ga s that kills insects and kills little animals. Usually when you do this, you have to take the people out, too, and then fumigate.

Sherin says, “You called a pest control company?” A  “pest” (pest) is another word for kind of like vermin, things that are small  animals that bother you. “Pest

control” would be a business that goes into a house  or a building and kills the insects, kills the animals, the vermin we might say , that are there.

The apartment manager says, “I didn’t need a pest c ontrol company to get rid of a few bugs, a few insects. I did it myself.” Sherin  says, “Oh, okay.” The apartment manager then says, “And six months ago, we had bedb ugs.” “Bedbugs” (bedbugs), one word, are little insects that live o n people’s bodies and are often found in mattresses, what you sleep on. They can be  found in carpets and in clothing and, like a tick, they also suck the blood  out of your body. So the manager says that they had bedbugs, but thanks to h is diligence, they're gone, too. “Diligence” (diligence) is careful, thorough, persistent work. Being very careful with something, going back and checking it everyday – that would be diligence. The apartment manager says he was very d iligent and now they don’t have any bedbugs. Then he asked Sherin, “So, you wa nt to see this apartment or don’t you?”

He’s asking her if she still wants to see the apart ment and she says perhaps wisely, intelligently, “I think I'll pass.” To “pas s.” as a verb. means to choose not to do something or to have something. Someone says,  “Oh, would you like a piece of apple pie or a piece of chocolate cake?” a nd you're on a diet, you're trying to lose weight. You say, “No, thank you, I'l l pass.” I'll not have it. Sherin says, “This conversation is making my skin crawl.” To make your skin “crawl” (crawl) means to be nervous, to be frightened, to b e anxious, perhaps even to be a little sick or disgusted by something, something that is very unpleasant and obviously talking about all these different bugs an d rodents makes Sherin’s skin crawl.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Apartment Manager:  This is the one-bedroom apartme nt we have for rent. Let me show you around.

Sherin:  Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a m ouse or a rat.

Apartment Manager:  There aren’t any rodents or any  other vermin in this apartment complex. I make sure of that.

Sherin:  Are you sure?

Apartment Manager:  Sure, I’m sure. Only last month , I bought some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all. This comple x is rodent-free.

# Buying Dinnerware

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 815: Buying Dinnerware.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 815. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, home of Hollywoo d, home of ESL Podcast.

On this episode, you will listen to a dialogue, but  what if you want more (and don’t we all want more in this life)? If you want m ore, you can download the Learning Guide. Yes, the Learning Guide will help y ou improve your English even faster. Go to our website at eslpod.com to find it.

This episode is about buying some new things to eat  with, what we would call “dinnerware.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  We need some new dinnerware. Nearly all of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.

Jason:  All right, you do that.

Wendy:  Aren’t you going to help?

Jason:  I trust your judgment. Whatever you like, I ’ll like, too.

Wendy:  But I need your input. For instance, this s et has eight place settings: eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, eight soup  bowls, and eight mugs. Everything is microwave-safe, too. What do you thin k of this pattern?

Jason:  It’s great. Let’s get that one.

Wendy:  Wait! This set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter. It has a nice blue pattern , see?

Jason:  Yeah, it’s perfect. Let’s buy that one.

Wendy:  Oh, but look at these other options on this  website. I don’t think I can decide unless I can see them in person. Let’s go.

Jason:  Go where?

Wendy:  To the store. I don’t want to buy something  half-assed. We’ll be using these dishes for many, many years.

Jason:  Like I said, I trust your judgment. Buy wha tever you want.

Wendy:  You’re not coming with me? Come on. What ca n I do to get you to come with me?

Jason:  You want me to go with you shopping on my d ay off and while the game is on? Dream on!

[end of dialogue]

Wendy begins our dialogue by saying to Jason, “We n eed some new dinnerware.” “Dinnerware” (dinnerware), one word, i ncludes plates, bowls, cups, silverware, a knife, a spoon, a fork – all of the t hings that you use what we would call the “dishes” to eat a meal. “Dinner” of course  is one of the three meals during the day: breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, a nd dinner in the evening.

Wendy says, “Nearly all, almost all, of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.” To be “cracked” (cracked) here means to h ave little lines through it. It's broken but it isn't completely broken. You could ha ve a glass with a crack in it. You would see a little line in the glass indicating  that it might break completely soon. To be “chipped” (chipped) means there's a lit tle hole or a little bit of the object that is missing. Usually this happens with a  piece of glass or other material, hard material, and there’ll be sort of li ke a little hole in it, not completely, not going through it, but just on the outside, on t he surface of it. We would say that is chipped.

Jason says, “All right, you do that,” meaning yes, you go and get some new dinnerware. Wendy says, “Aren't you going to help ( you lazy husband!)?” Well, she just says, “Aren't you going to help?” Jason sa ys, “I trust your judgment.” To “trust someone’s judgment” means that you believe t hat whatever this person does will be right. They will do the right thing. S o, you're not going to go with them or help them. You don’t need to. You say to th em, you do what you think is right and I'm sure that will be just fine with me. He says, “Whatever you like, I'll like, too.” This, of course, is what all husbands w ant to do when their wives ask them to help them buy things for the house, for exa mple. You know, I really don’t care what color the table is or what kind of rug we  have. Just go ahead, buy it. If

you're happy, I'm happy. That’s what Jason is sayin g – not me, Jason! Jason says, “Whatever you like, I'll like, too.”

Wendy says, “But I need your input.” “Input” (input ) means your opinion about how to do something. We might also use the word “fe edback” (feedback). Wendy says, “For instance, this set has eight place setti ngs.” “For instance,” meaning for example, this set, this collection of plates or din nerware has eight place settings. A “place setting” is what one person sitting down a t the table would need to eat with, so it would be a cup, a plate, a fork, a spoo n, a knife and so forth. Each one of those would be a place setting.

Wendy says, “This set of dishes has eight place set tings,” so enough for eight people: “eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, e ight soup bowls, eight mugs.” A “dinner plate” is a large plate where you can put u sually all of the main dish, the “entrée,” we would say, the main course for your me al. A “salad plate” quite obviously is a smaller plate used for eating “salad ,” a mixture of small pieces of vegetables usually when we talk about it in an Amer ican context, a salad. A salad plate is smaller than a dinner plate. Wendy also sa ys, “This set of place settings has eight soup bowls.” A “bowl” is a small containe r that you use to put something in, usually liquid, often liquid. In this  case, it's a bowl for eating, of course, soup.

Wendy says, “Everything is microwave-safe, too.” To  be “microwave-safe” means that you can put in a microwave and you won't damag e it, you won't hurt it. You know sometimes you put things in a “microwave,” whi ch is a special little oven that heats not using a flame, a fire or some sort o f hot piece of metal, but it heats food using microwaves, a special kind of radiation really. Well, if you put some things in a microwave oven, sometimes they can melt  or you can hurt them. You can damage them. These plates, however, according t o Wendy, are microwave- safe meaning it's okay, it won't damage the plates and the bowls.

Wendy says, “What do you think of this pattern?” A “pattern” (pattern) is a decoration, usually a repeating design of colors or  shapes on an object, so you might have a shirt that has lines that go up and do wn, black and white lines – that would be a pattern, kind of a strange pattern, but it would be a pattern. Or you might have a dress that has flowers on it, small li ttle flowers on it, that flower pattern repeats itself, so you have one, two, three , and then next to that you have three more flowers and so forth. That’s the pattern .

Wendy asks Jason what he thinks of the pattern. Jas on says, “It's great. Let's get that one.” Let's buy that one. Wendy says, “Wait! T his set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter.” So Wendy says,

“Oh, wait a minute, there's this other set of dishe s. It's a little more formal.” It's perhaps for more formal kinds of dinners, maybe whe n you have your boss over to your house for dinner. The plates are bigger, ab out a half an inch larger – I'm sorry, an inch larger in “diameter” (diameter). Dia meter is the distance across a circle, the length of the line that goes through the center of a circle and touches both sides of a circle. You learned about that back  in geometry when you were in school, and if you didn’t well, you can read a man named Euclid, an old Greek who wrote all about it.

Wendy says, “It has a nice blue pattern, see?” Jaso n says, “Yeah, it's perfect. Let's buy that one.” Jason, of course, doesn’t care . He just wants to make the decision and be done with it. Wendy, however, says,  “Oh, but look at these other options on this website.” She’s showing him more ex amples of dinnerware. “I don’t think I can decide unless I see them in perso n,” that is, unless I actually go to a store and see them, not just look at them on t he internet. She says, “Let's go.” Jason says, “Go where?”

Wendy says, “To the store. I don’t want to buy some thing half-assed.” To do something “half-assed” (half-assed) means not to do  a very good job at it, to attempt it, but not to be very serious about it. Th is expression is a vulgar one. I wouldn’t use it, really, myself. I would probably n ever use it, but if you did use it, it would only be in your family or with your spouse. T he word “ass” is a vulgar word, (ass) and so any terms that have that word in  it are probably ones that you don’t want to use very often if at all. Wendy says,  “We'll be using these dishes for many, many years.” “Dishes” is the same as dinnerwa re – the plates, the bowls, and so forth.

Jason says, “Like I said,” like I said before “I tr ust your judgment. Buy whatever you want.” Wendy says, “You're not coming with me? Come on!” – meaning “let's go.” “What can I do to get you to come with me?” Ja son says, “You want me to go with you shopping on my day off, (on a day I don ’t have to work) and while the game is on.” The “game” would be some sporting game : soccer, baseball, football, etc. Jason says, “Dream on.” The word “dr eam” (dream) has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “pa ttern,” which we mentioned earlier. Go to our Learning Guide for some addition al definitions of those two terms. The expression “dream on” or the phrase “dre am on” is an informal, sort of rude, phrase where you are telling a person that wh atever they are asking for or whatever they are hoping for is impossible. It's no t going to happen. “You think you're going to win the lottery and be a millionair e and have a million dollars? Dream on!” I'm saying that’s ridiculous, that’s imp ossible, that’s not going to happen. That’s what Jason is saying to Wendy. He’s not going to go with her to

buy dinnerware on a day where he doesn’t have to wo rk and there is a sport event on the television.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Wendy:  We need some new dinnerware. Nearly all of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.

Jason:  All right, you do that.

Wendy:  Aren’t you going to help?

Jason:  I trust your judgment. Whatever you like, I ’ll like, too.

Wendy:  But I need your input. For instance, this s et has eight place settings: eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, eight soup  bowls, and eight mugs. Everything is microwave-safe, too. What do you thin k of this pattern?

Jason:  It’s great. Let’s get that one.

Wendy:  Wait! This set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter. It has a nice blue pattern , see?

Jason:  Yeah, it’s perfect. Let’s buy that one.

Wendy:  Oh, but look at these other options on this  website. I don’t think I can decide unless I can see them in person. Let’s go.

Jason:  Go where?

Wendy:  To the store. I don’t want to buy something  half-assed. We’ll be using these dishes for many, many years.

Jason:  Like I said, I trust your judgment. Buy wha tever you want.

Wendy:  You’re not coming with me? Come on. What ca n I do to get you to come with me?

Jason:  You want me to go with you shopping on my d ay off and while the game is on? Dream on!

# Running a Pilot Program

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 816: Running a Pilot Program.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 816. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Jimmy and Rosali nd about starting a new program, a program that’s testing something. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rosalind:  How is the pilot program coming along?

Jimmy:  We’ll be ready to launch it in another mont h, but I have some serious reservations.

Rosalind:  Like what?

Jimmy:  We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet a nd we might come up against some resistance from the community.

Rosalind:  Isn’t that the nature of a pilot program ? When you’re paving the way, you’re always going to have skeptics and dissenters .

Jimmy:  You’re right, of course, but there’s a lot at stake. I just hope this trial run will win over some of those skeptics. It would be a  shame to scrap this program after we’ve put in so much work.

Rosalind:  After the program is launched, you’ll ha ve six months to prove its worth, right?

Jimmy:  Yeah, that’s right.

Rosalind:  That’s plenty of time for the dissenters  to see the light.

Jimmy:  From your lips to God’s ears!

[end of dialogue]

Rosalind says to Jimmy, “How is the pilot program c oming along?” A “pilot” (pilot) here means something that you are doing to test a p rogram, to test an idea, to see whether it will be successful. Usually, a pilot  program is with a small group of people. First you test it with a small group of peo ple and then, if it is successful, if it works, you use it with a larger group of people.  That’s a pilot program. The word “pilot” has a couple of different meanings in English, however. Take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those. So Rosalin d says to Jimmy, “How is the pilot program coming along?” meaning, how is it pro gressing? How is it developing? How is it going?

Jimmy says, “We'll be ready to launch it in another  month, but I have some serious reservations.” To “launch” (launch) means t o start something new, at least that’s what it means here, to do something for the first time. You might launch a new product for your business. You're goin g to start selling something that you’ve never sold before. That’s to launch, to  begin a new project or a new activity. Jimmy says, “I have some serious reservat ions.” “Reservations” are doubts, concerns, worries about something.

Rosaline says, “Like what?” In other words, give me  an example. Jimmy says, “We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet.” To “wo rk out all of the bugs” is a phrase meaning to fix all the problems. This is esp ecially used when we're talking about software problems. “Bugs” are problems. Bugs can also be little insects, little animals, but here it means a problem in some thing, in some program, perhaps even a computer program. Well, Jimmy says t hey haven’t worked out all of the bugs. They haven’t gotten rid of them. They haven’t solved all the problems.

He says, “And we might come up against some resista nce from the community.” To “come up against” means to be opposed by someone  or something, or it can mean simply to face, to confront. “I've come up aga inst some problems,” meaning I now have some problems that I didn’t see before or that I perhaps didn’t realize were there. Jimmy says that they mig ht possibly come up against some resistance from the community. “Resistance” is  opposition. When people don’t want to do something or even want to stop som ething. Sometimes we talk about governments and resistance movements. Resista nce movements would be people who are against the government, who try t o stop it or oppose it. Here, Jimmy is worried about resistance, opposition from the community. (We're not sure what that “community” is.)

 Rosalind says, “Isn't that the nature of a pilot pr ogram?” “Nature” (nature) here means the way something is done or a characteristic  or feature of something. So, when she says, “Isn't that the nature of a pilot pr ogram?” she means, well, that’s what a pilot program is supposed to help you with. She says, “When you're paving the way, you're always going to have skeptic s and dissenters.” To “pave (pave) the way” means here to do something for the first time, to be the first person or group to do something, which of course is  always more difficult than the second or the third or the fourth person to do something. If you're the first person, it's more difficult. If you are doing thing s that other people are going to be able to do after you, that is particularly a situat ion appropriate for this expression, “to pave the way.”

Rosalind says, “You're always going to have skeptic s and dissenters.” A “skeptic” (skeptic) is someone who questions or doubts whethe r something will work, someone who doesn’t believe in another person’s ide as, who’s always going, “Well, maybe not, I'm not sure. I don’t think that’ s right.” That person would be a skeptic. More common would be the adjective “skepti cal.” I'm very skeptical about this idea. I have a lot of doubts. I don’t th ink it's right. A “dissenter” (dissenter) is a person who “dissents” (dissents). The verb “to dissent” means to have a different opinion than the majority of peopl e, to disagree with something. Usually, you're disagreeing with most of the other people.

Jimmy says, “You're right, of course, but there's a  lot at stake.” The expression “at stake” (stake) means at risk or in question or that could be affected by this, so this is an important thing, he’s saying. There's a lot at stake. “I just hope this trial run will win over some of those skeptics.” A “trial  (trial) run” is an attempt to do something first before you do it with a larger grou p or do it on a larger scale. Really, it's the same as a pilot program. A trial r un is, “I'm going to test it to see if it works before I use it with 1,000 people,” for ex ample. “Win over” is a phrasal verb meaning to persuade, to convince, to change so meone’s opinion so that they will agree with you – someone who’s a dissente r or a skeptic, for example. “To win them over” means to get them to say, “Oh, o kay, I agree with you.”

Jimmy says, “It would be a shame to scrap this prog ram after we've put in so much work.” When we say, “It would be a shame” (sha me) – meaning it would be sad, it would be disappointing, it would be unfortu nate – “It would be a shame to scrap this program.” To “scrap” (scrap) means to de cide not to continue to do something, or to throw something away. More often, it means to stop supporting or promoting a particular project or idea. We're go ing to scrap this project or we're going to scrap this program. It means we're g oing to eliminate it. We're going to “delete” it, if you will.

 Rosalind says, “After the program is launched (afte r it is started), you'll have six months to prove its worth, right?” To “prove (prove ) something’s worth (worth)” means to demonstrate or to show that something work s, that it's valuable, that it should be continued. Jimmy says, “Yeah, that’s righ t.” They’ll have six months to prove its worth. Rosalind says, “That’s plenty of t ime for the dissenters to see the light.” The expression “to see the light” means to understand something that was difficult, perhaps to understand before or to under stand a very important, perhaps even profound thing, so that now you're going to ch ange your mind. You're going to change your actions even. Rosalind is saying tha t in six months, the dissenters, the people who don’t like this program,  will see the light. They’ll agree with Jimmy.

And Jimmy says an old expression, “From your lips t o God’s ears.” “Lips” (lips) are the two things that form your mouth. You have a n upper lip and a lower lip, two of them. The idea here is from your mouth, from  what you say, to “God’s ears.” This is another way of saying, “I hope what you are saying is true.” It's sort of like, “I hope that God hears you,” hears what yo u're saying, and therefore will give me my wish, will make this successful. “From y our lips to God’s ears” means I hope what you just said really is true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rosalind:  How is the pilot program coming along?

Jimmy:  We’ll be ready to launch it in another mont h, but I have some serious reservations.

Rosalind:  Like what?

Jimmy:  We haven’t worked out all of the bugs yet a nd we might come up against some resistance from the community.

# Getting a School Class Schedule

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 817: Getting a School Class Schedule.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 817. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Good morning, go od afternoon, good evening, whatever it is, when you're listening to this episo de, that is what I say to you.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide, a 10-page guide with a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode,. You can find that at eslpod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Carlos and Maria nne about going to school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos:  Did you get your class schedule?

Marianne:  Yeah. You?

Carlos:  Yeah. Let’s see if we have any classes tog ether. I have PE with Mr. Lopez and social studies with Ms. Walters. How abou t you?

Marianne:  I have PE with Ms. Schwartz and social s tudies with Ms. Eng. Who do you have for geography? I’m taking it with Mr. John son.

Carlos:  I’m not taking geography this semester. Wh o do you have for algebra? I have Ms. Abdul.

Marianne:  I’m not taking algebra. I’m taking calcu lus. Who do you have for chemistry?

Carlos:  I’m taking biology instead. This isn’t loo king good. Do we even have lunch together? I’ve been assigned the first lunch period. You?

Marianne:  I have the second lunch period. How is i t possible that we don’t have any classes together?

Carlos:  I have an idea. Are you taking band after school?

 Marianne:  No, you know I’m not musical. I’m taking  drama.

Carlos:  Drop drama and take band. That way, we’ll at least be able to hang out after school.

Marianne:  And what am I supposed to play in the ba nd when I’m tone deaf?

Carlos:  Have you ever heard of the drums?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Carlos asking Marianne, “D id you get your class schedule?” Your “class schedule” is a list of all o f the classes that a student will take, usually in junior high school and high school , sometimes in the younger grades. Students at the beginning of the year get a  list of their classes, with the time the classes begin, the names of the teachers a nd so forth.

Marianne says, “Yeah,” an informal way of saying “y es.” “You?” meaning, “Did you?” Carlos says, “Yeah. Let's see if we have any classes together.” Let's see if we are in any of the same classes. He says, “I have  PE with Mr. Lopez and social studies with Ms. Walters.” “PE” is short for  physical education. Sometimes we call it simply “gym class.” It's a class designe d to teach students to improve their physical strength, their physical health. “So cial studies” is a general term we use in the United States to refer to a lot of diffe rent specific areas of study. History is the most common kind of social studies, but it could also include geography, economics, the study of government (what  we might call “civics”), even anthropology in some schools. Social studies c an cover a lot of different things. I have – or used to have – a license to tea ch high school social studies, which means I could teach history, economics, psych ology, government, all sorts of things. I took classes in all sorts of those thi ngs myself when I was in college, though I don’t I think I would be a very good teach er of most of those subjects! Anyway, we're talking about the classes that Carlos  has.

Marianne says, “I have PE with Ms. Schwartz and soc ial studies with Ms. Eng,” meaning she is not in the same PE or social studies  class as Carlos. Marianne says, “Who do you have for geography?” “Who do you have” means who is your teacher. “Geography” is the study of land areas and  oceans of countries. It could be the physical geography. It could be the demograp hic information, information about the people in a certain country and so forth.  Geography, as I mentioned before, is really one are within the larger area of  social studies. But Marianne has a separate geography class. She has Mr. Johnson as her teacher. She says, “I'm

taking it with Mr. Johnson.” To “take a class” mean s to be part of a class in school.

Carlos says, “I'm not taking geography this semeste r,” meaning I am not in a class of geography. “Semester” (semester) is one-ha lf of a school year. Most school years are divided into two semesters. A scho ol year, which in the United States is usually September to early June, can also  be divided into quarters, but in most schools I think now they have semesters. In  my high school, they did. So the year is divided into two parts. There are some classes that only are one semester long. You only take them a half a year. Ot her classes, you take the whole year, both semesters.

Carlos then asks Marianne, “Who do you have for alg ebra?” “Algebra” (algebra) is a type of mathematics where you study symbols an d letters that represent numbers in what are called “equations”: n 2 plus 3 = 12 – that might be an equation you would study in algebra. In different s chools, algebra is taught in different grades, even in different states. Remembe r the American education system is very independent. Each state, each city, each area often has its own kinds of classes that it teaches. We don’t have a n ational list of classes that everyone has to take in a certain year. When I was in school, algebra wasn’t taught until the ninth grade, the first grade of hi gh school, in my school. In many other schools, it is taught at an earlier grade or at an earlier age, perhaps seventh or eighth grade. Anyway, I didn’t like alge bra. I really  didn’t like algebra. I didn’t like my algebra teacher when I was a freshma n and so I never really liked this subject. I forget what her name was…Mrs. Willi ams, I think. Carlos has Ms. Abdul as his algebra teacher.

Marianne says, “I'm not taking algebra. I'm taking calculus.” “Calculus” (calculus) is usually a math class you take after algebra. It' s more complicated. It's typically more complex, more difficult than algebra. I took c alculus also when I was a senior, my last year in high school and I also hate d it. And guess what? I had the same teacher! Marianne says, “Who do you have for c hemistry?” “Chemistry” (chemistry) is the study of elements and substances  that things are made of – hydrogen, oxygen, carbon. In chemistry, you study t hese substances and analyze them. I took chemistry when I was a junior in high school. I kind of like chemistry, actually. I had a teacher who I more or less liked, so chemistry was good.

Carlos says, “I'm taking biology instead,” meaning he’s not taking chemistry. He’s taking “biology” (biology). Biology is the study of  different forms of life, a study of what we might call living organisms. I took biology  when I was a sophomore, my second year of high school and I did not like it. T he teacher was okay. I just – I

don’t know, didn’t like it for some reason – don’t like blood! Carlos says, “This isn't looking good,” meaning it doesn’t look like t he two of them will have any classes together. He asks, “Do we even have lunch t ogether (our lunch break)? I've been assigned the first lunch period.” To be “ assigned” (assigned) means to be put into a certain group. You don’t really have a choice about it. Someone else decides this is where you're going to go. In t his case, Carlos has been assigned to the first lunch period, the time and the day when people, students, stop and eat lunch. He says, “You?” meaning, “What about you?”

Marianne says, “I have the second lunch period. How  is it possible that we don’t have any classes together?” Carlos says, “I have an  idea. Are you taking band after school?” “Band” (band) is when a group of peo ple get together and play musical instruments together. Many schools, especia lly high schools, have a band, a group of students who play musical instrume nts at sporting games and that sort of thing. Well, Carlos asks if Marianne i s taking band after school. A lot of schools have classes after the end of the day, e xtra classes and things that aren't really academic or school subjects.

Marianne says, “No, you know I'm not musical,” mean ing I don’t have any talent when it comes to music. She says, “I'm taking drama .” “Drama” (drama) is acting usually in a theater in a play.

Carlos says, “Drop drama and take band.” To “drop” something means to decide not to take a class. In American schools, you can “ add” (add) a class, meaning you can decide to take a class or you can drop a cl ass. “To drop” a class means to not have it on your schedule anymore, not to tak e it. Carlos wants Marianne to drop drama and take band instead. “That way, we'll at least be able to hang out after school.” To “hang (hang) out (out)” is a phra sal verb meaning to spend time with another person in a relaxed comfortable way, m aybe going to a movie or just going to a place to read or to talk or to have some thing to drink, to a café. That would be to hang out. You're not doing anything spe cial.

Marianne says, “And what am I supposed to play in t he band when I'm tone deaf?” Marianne is asking how she can play a musica l instrument if she’s “tone (tone) deaf(deaf).” A person who is “tone deaf” is unable to hear the differences between musical tones, musical notes, and that woul d make it very difficult for them to play a musical instrument.

Carlos says, “Have you ever heard of the drums?” A “drum” (drum) is a musical instrument that has a rhythmic beating sound when y ou hit it with a stick. However, drums are also made to sound or play diffe rent notes, so I'm not sure if that’s really going to help for Marianne.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos:  Did you get your class schedule?

Marianne:  Yeah. You?

Carlos:  Yeah. Let’s see if we have any classes tog ether. I have PE with Mr. Lopez and social studies with Ms. Walters. How abou t you?

Marianne:  I have PE with Ms. Schwartz and social s tudies with Ms. Eng. Who do you have for geography? I’m taking it with Mr. John son.

# Placing a Drink Order

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 818: Placing a Drink Order.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 818. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Are you interested in im proving your business English or English for daily life? We have special courses on our website just for that. Go there and take a look.

On this episode, we're going to listen to a convers ation between Joel and someone who works at a restaurant. Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Server:  Hello, I’m Allie and I’ll be your server t oday. Here’s a menu. Can I take your drink order?

Joel:  I’d like a glass of water with no ice.

Server:  Sure. Will that be sparkling or still?

Joel:  Uh, tap.

Server:  Okay, one glass of tap water. Would you li ke anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade...

Joel:  I’d like a Diet Coke.

Server:  Sure, I’ll be right back with your drinks in just one moment.

Joel:  Can you bring me a wine list?

Server:  No problem. Here is your water and Diet Co ke, and this is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular? We have  an extensive selection and some very fine house wines.

Joel:  I’m looking for the kind I drink at home.

Server:  What label is the wine you drink at home?

Joel:  I don’t remember the name, but it has a very  distinctive packaging.

Server:  Oh, can you describe it?

Joel:  Sure, it’s a large white box...

Server:  You mean it’s a boxed wine?

Joel:  Yes, that’s right.

Server:  I’m sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.

Joel:  And you call yourself a restaurant?

[end of dialogue]

Joel is sitting in a restaurant and a woman comes u p to him. She’s the waitress. We would also more generally call this the “server. ” The “server” (server) is the person who serves you your food, usually also the p erson who asks you what you want. We would use the expression “takes your o rder,” – asks you what you want to eat and drink and then gets those things for you.” That’s a server or a “waitress”, if it's a woman, a “waiter” (waiter), i f it's a man.

So, the waitress or server says, “Hello, I'm Allie, ” that’s her name “and I'll be your server today.” This is kind of become a common way that waiters and waitresses approach someone who comes to the restaurant and si ts down when they first walk up to you. They may give you their name.  Now,  personally I don’t usually remember their name, so giving me their name doesn’ t help me much, but that’s what some restaurants, a lot of restaurants, do now . The server will give her name or his name and tell you something obvious, li ke they’ll be your server today! The server says – Allie says – see? I rememb ered her name! – says, “Here's a menu. Can I take your drink order?” Your “drink order” would be what you want to drink.

Joel says, “I’d like a glass of water with no ice.”  “I'd like” is the same as “I'll have” which is the same as “I want.” Here's what I want t o order. Here's what I want you to bring me. “I'd like a glass of water with no  ice.” The server says, “Sure.” Okay. “Will that be sparkling or still?” When you g o to a nicer restaurant, you can get your water “sparkling” which means (the technic al word here would be “carbonated”) it has bubbles in it. “Still” would b e non-carbonated, without

bubbles, but still perhaps from a bottle. Joel howe ver says he wants “tap” (tap). Tap water is water that you just get from the sink.  So, there are three kinds of water you could get. Tap water would be just regula r water from a sink (or a faucet in a sink, technically – that’s the thing th at the water comes out of). Bottled water can be either still water or sparkling water.  Sparkling water has the “bubbles” in it, if you will.

The server says, “Okay, one glass of tap water. Wou ld you like anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade…” She starts listi ng all of the kinds of drinks that they have at this restaurant. “Soda” (soda), s ometimes called “soda pop” or in Minnesota, where I'm from, we say simply “pop.” It's a sweet carbonated (with bubbles) “beverage” or drink. Coca Cola, 7-Up, Peps i – those are all examples of soda. “Iced tea” is tea that is made the normal way  with hot water, but then you put it into ice and it becomes iced tea. Iced tea i s very popular in the summertime. “Lemonade” is a drink made by mixing the juice of a lemon, a fruit, with water and sugar. Lemonade is also very popular  in the summertime in the U.S.

Joel, however, says he wants a Diet Coke. When you order a drink that is “diet,” usually you're ordering it without all of the sugar . It has what we would say “fewer calories.” It's not as bad for you. It won't make y ou as fat. That’s really the idea. So, a lot of people like me who don’t want all of t he extra sugar will order a soda in its diet version, so Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. So metimes different soda companies have different names for this. There's a type of soda in the U.S. called Coke Zero. Well, that’s really another kind of Diet  Coke, but there's also a separate kind of Coke called Diet Coke. It's very c onfusing!

The server says, “Sure, I'll be right back,” meanin g I'll return quickly “with your drinks in just one moment,” in just a minute. Joel says, “Can you bring me a wine list?” The “wine list,” as it sounds, is a menu of the kinds of wine that you can purchase or buy at a restaurant or at a bar. Again,  a nicer restaurant will typically have a wine list that you can order from. I don’t g o to very many nice restaurants, so I don’t have a lot of experience with the wine l ist. When I do get a wine list, I don’t usually open it because I don’t drink wine ty pically for dinner. I have sometimes.

The server says to Joel’s request for the wine list , she says, “No problem,” which is sort of an informal way of saying “Oh sure, of c ourse.” Then she says, “Here is your water and Diet Coke.” So, she goes away back t o the kitchen and she gets some water, tap water, and a glass of Diet Coke. An d she says, “This is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular?” That is, is there a specific kind of wine that you like? She says, “We have an extensive  selection and some very

fine house wines.” “An extensive selection” would b e a lot of different kinds of wine. “Extensive” means large or many of or somethi ng that is very complete. So, this restaurant has an “extensive selection” meanin g an extensive number of different wines that you can order and she says (“A llie,” right?), Allie says, “some very fine house wines.” A “house wine” is not a win e that comes from your house. It's a wine that the restaurant sells usually by the glass. You can buy a bottle of wine in a restaurant or you can just buy (in many r estaurants) a glass of wine. Usually the house wine is not the most expensive on e. It's usually not a famous brand, a famous kind of wine, but it's – if it's a good restaurant, usually a good wine, not the best wine they have, however.

Joel says, “I'm looking for the kind I drink at hom e.” So, here Joel is saying that he wants the kind of wine that he also drinks at hi s house, so in some ways this is kind of a house wine, but that’s not the normal definition of house wine. In fact, the word “house” has a couple of different meanings . Take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those. Joel says he’s lookin g for the kind of wine that he drinks at home, so Allie asks him, “What label is t he wine you drink at home?” The “label” (label) is literally the piece of paper  or sticker on the outside of the wine bottle that tells you what kind of wine it is and what company made the wine. When we use it in this case, when someone say s, “What label is the wine?”, they mean what kind of wine, what company m ade the wine that you're interested in.

Joel says, “I don’t remember the name, but it has a  very distinctive packaging.” “Distinctive” means it's very easy to recognize. It  is something that as soon as you see it you know exactly what it is. “Packaging”  is the way that you sell a certain physical product. So, when you buy cereal, it comes in a box. The box is its packaging. It's the thing that you put it in, t he container, typically. Joel says that the wine he drinks at home has a very distinct ive packaging. The server says, “Oh, can you describe it?” Joel says, “Sure, it's a large white box.” The server says, “You mean it's a boxed wine?” A “boxed  wine” is a very cheap wine you can buy. Usually it is sold in a box. It's the cheapest, least expensive, and lowest quality kind of wine you could possibly buy,  not a very good wine.

Joel says, “Yes, that’s right.” It's a boxed wine. The server says, “I'm sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.” If you go to a restaur ant and they have boxed wines, it's probably not a very good restaurant, an d this is a good restaurant, so they don’t have any boxed wines. Joel is not happy.  He says, “And you call yourself a restaurant?” This expression, usually in  the form of a question, “And you call yourself (something),” is a phrase we use in a rude sort of way, or it could just be in a joking way, to question how some one has described himself. For example, I come from Minnesota where it's cold in the winter, so when I go

say to a warm place like here in California, people  expect me to be used to the cold. So, if it gets a little cold out and I say, “ Oh, it’s terrible here, it's freezing, it's really cold” and I start complaining, my family or other people who know I'm from Minnesota might say, “And you call yourself a Minne sotan?” meaning you're not really a Minnesotan. You're not really from Minneso ta if you think that, say, 50 degrees Fahrenheit is cold. So, Joel is saying here  that this isn't a real restaurant if they don’t have boxed wine. Of course, Joel is a  little crazy, so that’s the reason for that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Server:  Hello, I’m Allie and I’ll be your server t oday. Here’s a menu. Can I take your drink order?

Joel:  I’d like a glass of water with no ice.

Server:  Sure. Will that be sparkling or still?

Joel:  Uh, tap.

Server:  Okay, one glass of tap water. Would you li ke anything else? We have soda, iced tea, lemonade...

Joel:  I’d like a Diet Coke.

Server:  Sure, I’ll be right back with your drinks in just one moment.

Joel:  Can you bring me a wine list?

Server:  No problem. Here is your water and Diet Co ke, and this is our wine list. Are you looking for any wine in particular? We have  an extensive selection and some very fine house wines.

Joel:  I’m looking for the kind I drink at home.

Server:  What label is the wine you drink at home?

Joel:  I don’t remember the name, but it has a very  distinctive packaging.

Server:  Oh, can you describe it?

 Joel:  Sure, it’s a large white box...

Server:  You mean it’s a boxed wine?

Joel:  Yes, that’s right.

Server:  I’m sorry. We don’t have any boxed wines.

Joel:  And you call yourself a restaurant?

# Athletes Behaving Badly

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 819: Athletes Behaving Badly.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 819. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. If you really want to im prove your English as fast as possible, become a member of ESL Podcast and downlo ad a Learning Guide to help you do that.

This episode is a dialogue between Connie and Walt about people who play sports, professional athletes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Connie:  I just got a call from Ron’s agent. He’s i n hot water again.

Walt:  Not again! What did he get up to now?

Connie:  He got into another fight outside of a bar , and he’s in police custody right now cooling his heels. I don’t know what he w as thinking.

Walt:  It’s the off-season, so I can understand him  wanting to blow off some steam. But doesn’t he realize what he’s doing to hi s image and reputation?

Connie:  They don’t call him the bad boy of basketb all for nothing. I guess it’s our job to do some damage control.

Walt:  Yeah, and fast. Once the press gets a hold o f this, they’ll have a field day.

Connie:  It’s going to be a long night.

Walt:  Not as long as Ron’s.

Connie:  Serves him right!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Connie saying, “I just got  a call,” meaning I just received a telephone call, “from Ron’s agent.” An “ agent” (agent) is a representative, a person whose job it is to represe nt usually an athlete (that is, a sports player), a musician, a model, an actor, a wr iter. Many of these people have agents. They're sort of business people who re present them, who take care of their business negotiations and business contrac ts for them. Connie says, “He’s in hot water again,” meaning Ron is in hot wa ter. “To be in hot water” means to be in trouble, to have a lot of difficulti es, to have done something wrong and now you have problems.

Walt says, “Not again! What did he get up to now?” The expression “to get up to something” is a phrasal verb meaning to become invo lved in something, usually something bad, something that you should not be doi ng. “What did he get up to now?” Well, Connie says that he, Ron, got into anot her fight outside of a bar. A “fight” is when you hit someone else. A bar, of cou rse, is a place where people drink alcohol, so it's not surprising that there ar e fights outside of bars and that’s what happened to Ron. Now Connie says, “He’s in pol ice custody.” To be in “police custody” (custody) means that the police ca me and they arrested you. They are holding you. They won't let you go. Usuall y, they take you to a jail or to what we would call a “police station.” If you get i n trouble, that can happen to you. And that’s what happened to Ron.

Connie says, “He’s in police custody right now cool ing his heels.” This expression to “cool (cool) your heels” (heels) means to spend time calming down. When you're very angry or very emotional, someone might say to you, “You need to cool your heels.” Your “heel” is the part of your f oot, the bottom, back part of your foot, but the expression “to cool your heels” perha ps means that you need to be running around less. In any case, it means that you  need to calm down. You need to be less angry, less emotional. Connie says,  “I don’t know what he was thinking,” meaning I'm not sure why he did this.

Walt says, “It’s the off-season.” The “off-season” is when a sport is not being played. For example, baseball is played between, sa y, April and October. That means that November, December, January, February, t he first part of March, that’s the off-season. That’s when there isn't any professional baseball games or there aren't any professional baseball games. That’ s the off-season. Walt says, “It's the off-season, so I can understand him wanti ng to blow off some steam.” The expression “to blow off some steam” (steam) mea ns to release negative emotions or extra energy or stress in some way. Let 's say you come home from work and you had a bad day, a very stressful day, s o you decide to go for a run. You're going to jog around your neighborhood in ord er to relax, to blow off some steam. That’s the idea.

 Walt says, “Doesn’t he, Ron, realize that what he’s  doing to his image and reputation?” Walt is asking why Ron is doing these crazy things like getting involved in a fight outside of a bar and then getti ng arrested or taken by the police. He asked whether Ron realizes what all of t his is doing to his image. Your “image” (image) is the way other people look at you . It's the way other people see you. Reputation is very closely related to that. Th at’s what other people think about you. Your reputation is what other people thi nk. You may have a reputation for being a funny person. That means other people, when they think of you, think, “Oh yeah, he’s funny.” We want to have a good reput ation, of course, and not a bad reputation, but Ron is getting a bad reputation  by doing all of these stupid things. But sometimes professional athletes do stup id things.

Connie says, “They call him the bad boy of basketba ll for nothing.” This phrase “they don’t call someone something for nothing” is used to emphasize that someone has earned or deserves the image and reputa tion that they have. So, for example, someone may be a very good singer and they stand up and they sing a wonderful song, and you say to your friend, “They don’t call him the best singer in the world for nothing,” meaning there's a  reason why people think he’s a good singer and he just demonstrated it. So, when s omebody does something that shows that whatever their image or reputation is, is true, that is when we would use this expression. So, Ron is known, he has  the reputation, for being the bad boy of basketball. Basketball of course is the sport. To be a “bad boy” means to be a boy or a man who’s actions are often breaki ng the rules, somebody who doesn’t care what other people think of him, somebo dy who does things that are wrong or that are bad.

Connie says, “I guess it's our job to do some damag e control.” “Damage” is when you hurt something. “Damage control” is when there' s a problem or a negative situation and somebody tries to make it so that it isn't as bad as it might be, someone who tries to stop the problem from getting any bigger or any worse. So, let's say we have a famous singer or a famous actor  and they have a drug problem or they get arrested for doing something ba d, something wrong, their agents, their representatives will try to do some d amage control. They’ll try to talk to the newspapers and magazines and say, “Well, he was having a bad day” or he’s really sorry about what happened. That’s damag e control. That’s trying to protect and save this person’s reputation from gett ing any worse.

Walt says, “Yeah, and fast,” meaning we need to do some damage control quickly. “Once the press gets a hold of this, they’ ll have a field day.” The expression “to get a hold of something” means to ge t information, to find out about something, to obtain information that might b e difficult to get. The “press”

refers to the media: newspapers, magazines, televis ion reporters, etc. “To have a field day” is an expression meaning to have a lot o f fun doing something without any limits or any restrictions. We're going to have  a field day at Starbucks by drinking all the coffee we possibly can. We're goin g to the café and we're going to have a field day. This expression is often used,  as it is in this dialogue, to talk about what will happen if somebody finds out about some secret negative or damaging information. When the television stations find out that Ron had a fight, they’ll have a field day, meaning they’ll really ma ke fun of him. It will be a very damaging time because they found out this informati on.

Connie says, “It's going to be a long night,” meani ng we're going to have to stay up late in order to do this damage control, making phone calls and so forth.

Walt says, “Not as long as Ron’s,” meaning Ron will  have an even more difficult night because of course, he is being held by the po lice.

Connie then says, “Serves him right!” The expressio n “serves him right” or “serves them right” or “serves her right” is used w hen you are expressing your opinion that when something bad happened to someone , they deserved it. It was because they did something wrong that they are gett ing a negative consequence for their behavior or for their actions. So, somebo dy starts drinking and they start driving and then the police stop them and arrest th em. You might say, “Well, serves them right!” meaning, they deserve that beca use they did something bad. They did something wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Connie:  I just got a call from Ron’s agent. He’s i n hot water again.

Walt:  Not again! What did he get up to now?

Connie:  He got into another fight outside of a bar , and he’s in police custody right now cooling his heels. I don’t know what he w as thinking.

Walt:  It’s the off-season, so I can understand him  wanting to blow off some steam. But doesn’t he realize what he’s doing to hi s image and reputation?

Connie:  They don’t call him the bad boy of basketb all for nothing. I guess it’s our job to do some damage control.

Walt:  Yeah, and fast. Once the press gets a hold o f this, they’ll have a field day.

Connie:  It’s going to be a long night.

Walt:  Not as long as Ron’s.

Connie:  Serves him right!

# Performing Poorly at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 820: Performing Poorly at Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 820. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue – what a surprise! – bet ween Cora and Doug about not doing your best at your job. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cora:  What’s up with Rob? He hasn’t been himself l ately.

Doug:  You’ve noticed, too, huh?

Cora:  Yeah, he’s been missing work and letting thi ngs slip through the cracks. I’ve been cutting him some slack and filling in for  him, but things haven’t improved.

Doug:  I know what you mean. I’d never known Rob to  drop the ball on anything until recently. I heard a rumor that he’s having fi nancial problems.

Cora:  No, not Rob! He has more clients than anyone  around here.

Doug:  Well, he’s been off his game for a while now , so some of those accounts might have gone up in smoke.

Cora:  Are you going to have a talk with him? Maybe  you could help.

Doug:  Me? Why me?

Cora:  I thought you two were pretty tight.

Doug:  We’re friendly at work, but we’re not really  friends. The last thing I want to do is to snoop around in his business.

Cora:  But maybe he’s just waiting for a shoulder t o cry on. You might be just the person to get him to bare his soul.

Doug:  Spoken just like a woman! You all think we m en are waiting to bare our souls and let our emotions out. Just leave Rob alon e to solve his own problems.

Cora:  Spoken just like a cold-hearted man!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Cora saying to Doug, “What 's up with Rob?” “What's up” means what's going on, what's the problem? What 's the issue with Rob? “He hasn’t been himself lately.” “To not be yourself” m eans that you're acting in an unusual way, a strange way. You're acting different ly than how you normally act. You may say to someone he hasn’t been himself. He’s  been very sad or depressed. Normally, he’s very happy. He hasn’t bee n himself.

Doug says, “You’ve noticed, too, huh?” You’ve also noticed, Doug is saying. The “huh” at the end is sometimes used to ask a questio n when we've made a statement.

Cora says, “Yeah, he’s been missing work,” he has n ot been coming to his job, “and letting things slip through the cracks.” The e xpression to “slip” (slip) through the “cracks” (cracks) means not to do everything yo u should be doing, especially the little things, because you're not being careful , you're not paying attention to everything.

Cora says, “I've been cutting him some slack and fi lling in for him, but things haven’t improved.” “To cut someone some slack” (sla ck) means not to criticize someone or not to be hard on someone even though th ey're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, not judging someone e ven though they're not doing a good job. You're not judging them as you mi ght otherwise. You're perhaps not punishing them the way you would in a d ifferent situation. That’s what “to cut someone some slack” means. While Cora is cutting Rob some slack, she’s also been filling in for him. “To fill in for  someone” means to do someone else’s job for a short period of time, to help some one when they can't be at their job. So, you're supposed to work at a grocery store  and you can't be there one day and you're supposed to work, you ask a friend t o fill in for you, to substitute for you for that day. Cora says, “Things haven’t im proved.” Things haven’t gotten better.

Doug says, “I know what you mean.” I understand you . “I’ve never known Rob to drop the ball on anything.” “To drop the ball” is a n expression meaning not to do something that you are supposed to do, not to meet your obligations, not to do what people expect you to do. Doug says, “I heard a  rumor that he’s having financial problems.” “I heard a rumor” (rumor) mean s I've heard something that people have said that it might be true, it might be  false – I don’t know. Another word we might use here is “gossip” (gossip). Gossip  or rumors are things that people say that nobody really knows if they're true  or not, usually they're interesting things, often bad things about people. We talk about gossip for famous people or about famous people, rumors. Some people say that she’s going to get a divorce or some people said that he is breaking up with his girlfriend. Those would be rumors. You're not sure if it's true. It might be true. (I'm not breaking up with my girlfriend because I don’t have a girlfriend.) Doug says that Rob might be having financial problems, not en ough money.

Cora says, “No, not Rob! He has more clients than a nyone around here.” A “client” (client) is another word for a customer, e specially a customer that has a long-term relationship with your company. Often we use this term when we talk about services, selling people not physical things but, say, accounting services or legal services we may refer to someone as a “client .” Well, Rob has a lot of clients. Cora says, “… more clients than anyone aro und here,” meaning anyone here at this company.

Doug says, “Well, he’s been off his game for a whil e now.” “To be off your game” means not to be performing as well as you normally do, not to be doing as well as you typically do. He’s been off his game for a w hile now, meaning for some time, so some of those accounts, some of those clie nts, might have gone up in smoke. “To go up in smoke” (smoke) means to disappe ar, to stop existing. “Smoke” is of course what happens when you burn som ething. It's the white, gray, or black substance that goes up into the air,  that’s smoke. “To go up in smoke” means to be burned up, literally, but really  here it means simply to disappear, not to succeed.

Cora says, “Are you going to have a talk with him?”  Are you going to talk to him about this? “Maybe you could help.” Doug says, “Me?  Why me?” Cora says, “I thought you two were pretty tight.” “Tight” (tight)  here means to have a close relationship with another person, someone who is a very, very good friend who you give personal information to, who knows you ver y well. “Tight” has several other meanings in English as well. Take a look at o ur Learning Guide for those.

Doug says, “We're friendly at work, but we're not r eally friends.” You can be friendly with someone by being nice to them, but th at doesn’t mean that you are

their friend, that you actually consider them your friend. You're just being nice. Doug says, “The last thing I want to do is to snoop  around in his business.” “To snoop (snoop) around” means to try to find informat ion about someone without the other person knowing what you are doing. We mig ht say to spy on or to investigate in some secret way. Doug says he doesn’ t want to snoop around in Rob’s business, meaning in his life. Even though we  say business here, we really mean his personal matters, his personal life.

Cora says, “But maybe he’s just waiting for a shoul der to cry on.” The expression “a shoulder (shoulder) to cry on” is used to descri be someone who is willing to listen to another person’s problems. So, you have a  friend and your friend broke up with his girlfriend and now he’s sad. Actually, his girlfriend broke up with him. She ended the relationship, and now he’s sad and yo u go to a bar and you have a few drinks and he tells you all the details of wh at happened. This happens to me every once in a while, a friend of mine – used t o happen – a friend of mine would break up with a girlfriend and then they woul d tell me all their problems, everything that happened, everything she said, ever ything he said – you understand. That’s to have a shoulder to cry on. Yo u are the person they go to to cry on, that is, to tell their problems to. Your sh oulder, of course, is the upper part of your arm and sometimes, for example, a woman may  cry on a man’s shoulder by putting her head on his shoulder if she’s sad ab out something.

Cora says, “You might just be the person to get him  to bare his soul.” To “bare” (bare) means to take something off, to remove somet hing, usually your clothing. We talk about someone being “bare naked” meaning ha ving no clothes on. “To bare your soul” (soul), however, means to share you r most personal thoughts to another person, to tell someone your most secret fe ars and secret thoughts.

Doug says, “Spoken just like a woman,” meaning Cora  is talking like a woman might talk. He says, “You all,” meaning you women, “think we men are waiting to bare our souls and let our emotions out,” our feeli ngs out. “Just leave Rob alone to solve his own problems.” In other words, men, we  don’t like to talk about our deep personal problems with other men. That’s what women think we should do, but we're men. We don’t do that, do we men? Real me n don’t cry. That’s what they say.

Cora says, “Spoken just like a cold-hearted man!” S omeone who’s “cold-hearted” (hearted) is someone who doesn’t have a lot of symp athy or empathy for other people, someone who isn't able to understand other people or doesn’t feel badly when he does something wrong to someone else. That would be a cold-hearted person. Back in the 1980s, Paula Abdul had her song  “Cold-Hearted Snake.” A “snake” of course is an animal that crawls on the g round and moves back and

forth. To call someone a snake would be a very insu lting thing, someone who is secretive, someone who deceives you, someone who li es to you, so she had this song: He’s a cold-hearted snake Look into his eyes Oh oh, he’s been telling lies. Cold-hearted snake, Paula Abdul. Sing that today at  your work.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cora:  What’s up with Rob? He hasn’t been himself l ately.

Doug:  You’ve noticed, too, huh?

Cora:  Yeah, he’s been missing work and letting thi ngs slip through the cracks. I’ve been cutting him some slack and filling in for  him, but things haven’t improved.

Doug:  I know what you mean. I’d never known Rob to  drop the ball on anything until recently. I heard a rumor that he’s having fi nancial problems.

# Eating Contaminated Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 821: Eating Contaminated Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 821. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los An geles, California.

Our dialogue is on our website. You can also downlo ad a Learning Guide from that same website, eslpod.com. Go there today and b ecome a member.

How are you doing today? Are you happy? Are you sad ? Let's hope you're happy. If not, let's listen to this dialogue and ma ybe that will make you happy. It's about eating contaminated food, food that has somet hing wrong with it, and there's nothing happier than the subject of contami nated food. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Rachel:  This tastes funny.

Sergey:  It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it.

Rachel:  It tastes like it’s tainted or something. Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?

Sergey:  No, it’s perfectly fine. Just eat it.

Rachel:  I swear there’s something off about this f ood. I’m not eating adulterated food. There’s probably poison in here and we’re bot h going to die a terrible death.

Sergey:  There is nothing poisonous or toxic in thi s food. I made it myself.

Rachel:  Did you make sure that the milk wasn’t sou r and that none of the ingredients were spoiled? I’ll probably die from bo tulism.

Sergey:  There’s nothing spoiled, tainted, toxic, o r poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?

Rachel:  I think I’ll pass.

Sergey:  Then hand it over. I’m hungry. I’ve never met such a hypochondriac before!

Rachel:  I’m not a hypochondriac. I’m just a little  paranoid...

[end of dialogue]

Our happy dialogue begins with Rachel saying, “This  tastes funny.” You see? “Funny” – it’s already a happy dialogue. We have the word “funny.” Well, in some cases, it can mean something that makes you laugh. He’s very funny – ha, ha, ha, ha. But “funny” here, when we're talking about the ways something tastes in your mouth, means strange or unusual, usually in a bad way, meaning there's something wrong with it. It might make you sick. It  might kill you. It's a weird phrase, but we use the word funny with the verb tas te when we mean food has some unusual, usually bad taste. Sergey says, “It's  fine. There's nothing wrong with it.” There's nothing wrong with the food, Serg ey says.

Rachel, however, says, “It tastes like it's tainted  or something.” It tastes like it has the taste in my mouth of something that is “tainted ” (tainted). “Tainted” is another word for contaminated. It means something – some fo od or drink – contains something that is harmful or poisonous. It's not sa fe to eat or drink it. Rachel says, “Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?” To  “detect” (detect) means to be able to identify the presence or existence of somet hing, to be able to tell, if you will, that it's there. Don’t you detect, can't you taste, a funny metallic taste? “Metallic” (metallic) comes from the word metal, so  something that tastes like metal, which of course is not a very nice taste.

Sergey says, “No, it's perfectly fine.” “Perfectly”  here means completely, no problem. “Just eat it,” he says to Rachel. Rachel s ays, “I swear,” meaning I believe, I really believe, “there's something off a bout this food.” When we say the food is “off” (off), we mean it's not quite right. We can use this expression, “there's something off about this television progra m” or “there's something off about the way I'm feeling.” It's not quite right. I t's wrong, but it's difficult to say exactly what the problem is. If you say there's som ething off about this food, you mean it doesn’t taste good. You're not sure what the problem is, but you know there's something wrong with it.

Rachel says, “I'm not eating adulterated food.” “Ad ulterated” (adulterated) means the same as tainted or contaminated. Usually, howev er, adulterated means that something was actually added to the product, to the  food or the drink. Someone actually put something in there that was contaminat ed. Sometimes it is done on purpose, and that’s the idea here, that someone put  something in there that

makes it not the food you think it is. Rachel says,  “There's probably poison in here and we're both going to die a terrible death.”  Didn’t I tell you this was going to be a happy dialogue? There's probably “poison” ( poison) means there's probably a substance here that will kill us or hurt  us if we eat it or drink it or perhaps even touch it. Poison is something, some su bstance, some chemical substance often, that kills you. “A terrible death”  would be a horrible way to die, a very slow and painful death might be a terrible dea th. Well, Rachel is probably not serious, but you don’t really know. Maybe there  is poison and they will die a terrible death.

Sergey says, “There is nothing poisonous or toxic i n this food. “Toxic” (toxic) is the same as poisonous. It contains some substance t hat will kill you or that will hurt you. It has something that will injure you or perhaps kill you. Sergey insists that there's nothing wrong with the food. He says, “I made it myself.” I made this food.

Rachel said, “Did you make sure that the milk wasn’ t sour and that none of the ingredients were spoiled?” “Sour” (sour) here means  gone bad. When you have a food or a drink that is not eaten quickly enough, s ometimes it will go sour. It will go bad. It will “spoil” (spoil). Well, if you put m ilk out in the sun, eventually the milk will sour. It will change so that you can't ea t it, or drink it, rather, anymore. That’s what Rachel is asking Sergey, if he used mil k that was not sour and that none of the ingredients were spoiled. “Ingredients”  are the things you use to make a certain kind of food. So if you're making la sagna, an Italian food, you would have pasta and perhaps tomato sauce and veget ables and meat and cheese. These are ingredients for that particular d ish, that particular kind of food. Rachel is asking Sergey if he made sure that none o f the ingredients were spoiled. Remember “spoiled” means they’ve gone bad.  We might say they're “rotten” (rotten). When you wait too long to eat a certain kind of food, it could spoil. It would no longer be able to be eaten. That ’s the idea.

Rachel then says, “I'll probably die from botulism. ” “Botulism” (botulism) is a kind of food poisoning that can often kill you. It's cau sed by certain bacteria being in the food, things that shouldn’t be there, especiall y if you put them in a certain kind of can, or if something happens and the food s omehow gets this bacteria in it. It could kill you. It's a kind of food poisonin g. Well, that’s what Rachel says here, “I'll probably die from botulism.”

Rachel – come on, Rachel! I mean, she’s sort of wha t we would call a drama queen. A “drama queen” is someone who is always ver y dramatic about something, who always exaggerates things: “Oh, it's  so hot in here, I think I will die!” That would be kind of someone who’s a drama q ueen, someone who thinks

that something bad is going to happen to her, or so meone who – a woman – who exaggerates problems that she has, who always is ma king things worse than they actually are.

Sergey says, “There's nothing spoiled, tainted, tox ic, or poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?” Rachel says, “I think I'll pass.” “To pass” means I'm not going to do it. To decide not to do somethi ng is to pass. Sergey says, “Then hand it over.” “Hand it over” is a somewhat r ude way of saying “Give me that!” Give that thing to me. If you are being robb ed by a thief, someone has a gun and comes up to you and wants your money, he ma y say, “Hand it over!” meaning give it to me right now. That’s what Sergey  says. “Hand it over. I'm hungry. I've never met such a hypochondriac before! ” A “hypochondriac” (hypochondriac) is a person who believes that he or  she has many diseases even when they don’t have any diseases. This is the  kind of person who reads about something in the newspaper and says, “Oh, I h ave that. I have that sickness. That’s me.” And they start to feel sick e ven when there's nothing wrong with them. That’s a hypochondriac.

Rachel says, “I'm not a hypochondriac. I'm just a l ittle paranoid.” “Paranoid” (paranoid) is when you're very worried and anxious about something because you think someone else is trying to hurt you. You t hink someone else is trying to kill you or maybe just follow you around, someone w ho’s paranoid thinks everyone is trying to get him. And that’s what Rach el is, in addition to being a drama queen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rachel:  This tastes funny.

Sergey:  It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it.

Rachel:  It tastes like it’s tainted or something. Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?

Sergey:  No, it’s perfectly fine. Just eat it.

Rachel:  I swear there’s something off about this f ood. I’m not eating adulterated food. There’s probably poison in here and we’re bot h going to die a terrible death.

Sergey:  There is nothing poisonous or toxic in thi s food. I made it myself.

Rachel:  Did you make sure that the milk wasn’t sou r and that none of the ingredients were spoiled? I’ll probably die from bo tulism.

Sergey:  There’s nothing spoiled, tainted, toxic, o r poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?

Rachel:  I think I’ll pass.

Sergey:  Then hand it over. I’m hungry. I’ve never met such a hypochondriac before!

Rachel:  I’m not a hypochondriac. I’m just a little  paranoid...

# Having a Frightening Experience

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 822: Having a Frightening Experience.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 822.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los An geles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Oliver and Alena  about being scared, or having a frightening experience.  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Oliver:  I had the most hair-raising experience of my life this past weekend.

Alena:  What happened?

Oliver:  You know that George bought an old house, right?  Well, he’s been telling us that it’s haunted, so for a lark, a few of us decided to spend the weekend there to see if we would have any supernatu ral experiences.

Alena:  Are you telling me that you saw ghosts?

Oliver:  I’m not sure what we saw, heard, or felt.  Everything was fine when we got there, but then we started hearing strange nois es and I started to get goosebumps.  The other guys tried to play it off, b ut I know they were scared, too.

Alena:  What did George say about the noises?

Oliver:  He laughed when he saw us jump out of our skins, and told us we were wusses.  He said he heard those noises every night and they didn’t have him quaking in his boots.

Alena:  Did anything else happen?

Oliver:  Well, when we went to bed, the house got v ery cold and drafty, like there was something passing by me very closely, but I cou ldn’t see it.  That sent me over the edge.

Alena:  Has it ever occurred to you that George was  playing a prank on you guys?

Oliver:  A prank?  It was no prank.  In the middle of the night when we saw the strange faces in the windows, even George was scare d stiff.  By that time, all of us were petrified.  It was no prank.  That house is  haunted.

Alena:  Ooh, a real haunted house.  I’d love to spe nd the night there, too.  Do you think George would let you stay there again and let  me come, too?

Oliver:  You want me to go back to that house?  For get it!  Wild horses couldn’t drag me within 50 miles of that place again!

[end of dialogue]

Oliver begins by saying, “I had the most hair-raisi ng experience of my life this past weekend.”  I had the most hair (hyphen) -raisi ng experience.  Something that is “hair-raising” is something that is very sc ary, something that makes you afraid, something that is frightening.  It’s so sca ry, so frightening, that the hair on your arms or on your neck begins to stand up – begi ns to be affected somehow. The idea is when you’re very scared somehow your ha irs on your hands or your arms or your neck or your nose – well, maybe not yo ur nose – they become affected because you’re so scared.  Oliver had a ha ir-raising or scary experience this past weekend, meaning the weekend that just en ded.

Alena says, “What happened?”  Oliver says, “You kno w that George bought a new house, right?  Well, he’s been telling us that it’s haunted.”  When we say something is “haunted” (haunted) we mean that it is  being visited by ghosts, or spirits of dead people who’ve been dead for a long time; that’s haunted.  On Halloween, on October 31 st , we have haunted houses where children go and the idea is that the house has ghosts and other spirits  in it that try to scare the children.  It’s a lot of fun!

Well, George says his house is haunted, “so for a l ark,” Oliver says, “some of us decided to spend the weekend there to see if we wou ld have any supernatural experiences.”  The expression “for a lark” (lark) m eans for a joke, to be entertaining or funny.  So, Oliver and his friends stayed at this house to see if they would have any supernatural experiences.  “Sup ernatural” means not

explainable by science, something that seems imposs ible; something that is above nature, above the way things are supposed to work according to scientific laws.

Alena says, “Are you telling me that you saw ghosts ?”  A “ghost” (ghost) is the spirit of a person who has died.  Usually in the mo vies or on television you see this person as being sort of, I don’t know, sort of  cloudy, sort of unclear; that’s a ghost.

Oliver says, “I’m not sure what we saw, heard, or f elt.  Everything was fine when we got there, but then we started hearing strange n oises and I started to get goosebumps.”  So, Oliver and his friends go to this  house as a joke because their friend George said it was haunted, and now when the y get there they actually hear some strange, unusual noises.  Oliver says he started to get goosebumps (goosebumps – one word).  “Goosebumps” are when you ’re either very cold or very frightened you have these little bumps, these little areas of raised skin that you can feel on your arms and on your legs.  That’s  goosebumps.  Goosebumps could be, uh, a negative thing; it might also be a positive thing.  You might hear someone singing, and it was so good you get goosebu mps.  It’s like your body is somehow affected by it physically.  Goosebumps  was also the name of a popular book series for mostly young boys – fourth grade, f ifth grade boys, was very popular in the 90s and perhaps still is.

Oliver says, “The other guys (the other men) tried to play it off, but I know they were scared, too.”  “To play it off” means to prete nd that something is not important.  You’re trying to show how brave you are , how calm you are, and so you’re not paying attention to it.  We might also s ay, perhaps a little more commonly, “to laugh it off,” to say oh, that’s noth ing; you make a joke about it. Well, Oliver says that he thinks the other guys wer e scared or frightened or afraid, just like him.

Alena says, “What did George say about the noises?”   Oliver says, “George laughed when he saw us jump out of our skin.”  The expression means to be very frightened, to be very scared.  Oliver says that Ge orge told them that they were wusses.  A “wuss” (wuss) is an informal insult, som ewhat vulgar, that means that you are not brave, that you are very scared, that y ou don’t have any courage.  It’s usually something a man would say to another man, o r perhaps a boy would say to another boy: “Oh, you’re a wuss.”  You’re not br ave; you’re not strong; that’s the idea.  Another word would be a “coward” (coward ).  That’s probably a more polite and common word – well, not polite; if you’r e insulting someone you’re not trying to be polite.  But it’s a little more accept able in conversational English to

say someone is a “coward,” and that’s the word you would find in the newspaper or in a book that talked about this same idea.

Oliver continues by saying that George said he hear d those noises every night and they didn’t have him quaking in his boots.  “To  quake” (quake) means to shake.  “To quake in your boots” means to be very f rightened, to be very scared; your “boots” are like big shoes that you have to co ver your feet.  Well, “to quake in your boots” means to be so scared that you’re sh aking; that’s the idea.

Alena says, “Did anything else happen?”  Oliver rep lies, “Well, when we went to bed, the house got very cold and drafty, like there  was something passing by me very closely, but I couldn’t see it.”  So when they  went to bed, when they went to go to sleep, Oliver says that the house got very co ld and drafty (drafty).  “Drafty” means there’s a lot of air moving through the build ing, a lot of cold air, almost as though the walls have holes in them.  Oliver said i t was as if is something were passing by him, coming very close to him.  He says,  “That sent me over the edge.”  “To send (someone) over the edge” (edge) me ans that you become very frightened or perhaps very angry; it’s when you los e control of your emotions – of your thoughts, sort of like going crazy.

Alena says, “Has it ever occurred to you,” have you  thought about this possibility?  “Has it ever occurred to you that Geo rge was playing a prank on you guys?”  “Prank” (prank) is a trick, sometimes calle d a “practical joke,” where you do something that is funny, but you are doing it wi th someone else to make them look foolish or to make them look silly.

Oliver says, “A prank?  It was no prank,” meaning n o, it was not a joke.  “In the middle of the night when we saw the strange faces i n the window, even George was scared stiff.”  “To be scared stiff” (stiff) me ans to be very frightened, to be very scared.  So, Oliver says they saw some strange  faces in the window late at night and this made them scared stiff, even George.   “By that time, all of us were petrified.”  “To be petrified” (petrified) here mea ns to be very scared, to be very frightened.  Oliver says, “It was no prank,” he rep eats, “That house is haunted.”

Alena says, “Ooh, a real haunted house.”  Now when she says this, she’s being sarcastic; she’s making fun of Oliver.  Or, perhaps  she’s just interested in haunted houses!  She says, “I’d love to spend the n ight there, too (I’d like to go there and sleep there overnight).  Do you think Geo rge would let you stay there again and let me come, too?” meaning I would go wit h you.  Oliver says, “You want me to go back to that house?  Forget it!  Wild  horses couldn’t drag me within 50 miles of that place again!”  Oliver’s say ing no, I’m not going back to the house.  He uses an old expression “wild horses coul dn’t drag me.”  The phrase is

used to emphasize that something will not happen un der any circumstances, something that you absolutely will not do.  “Wild h orses could not drag me to go see the movie by Adam Sandler.”  Wild horses couldn ’t drag me.  “To drag” means to pull someone, usually against their will.  They don’t want to do something; but you pull than physically, perhaps by  the arm, so that they will come when you.  If you had wild horses running very  fast dragging you, that would be a lot of force, that would be very difficu lt to resist.  So, the expression is used to show that even if you did something terribl e to me or forced me, I would not do this thing.  In this case, for Oliver it’s g oing back to George’s haunted house.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Oliver:  I had the most hair-raising experience of my life this past weekend.

Alena:  What happened?

Oliver:  You know that George bought an old house, right?  Well, he’s been telling us that it’s haunted, so for a lark, a few of us decided to spend the weekend there to see if we would have any supernatu ral experiences.

Alena:  Are you telling me that you saw ghosts?

Oliver:  I’m not sure what we saw, heard, or felt.  Everything was fine when we got there, but then we started hearing strange nois es and I started to get goosebumps.  The other guys tried to play it off, b ut I know they were scared, too.

Alena:  What did George say about the noises?

Oliver:  He laughed when he saw us jump out of our skins, and told us we were wusses.  He said that he heard those noises every n ight and they didn’t have him quaking in his boots.

Alena:  Did anything else happen?

Oliver:  Well, when we went to bed, the house got v ery cold and drafty, like there was something passing by me very closely, but I cou ldn’t see it.  That sent me over the edge.

# Dealing With a Bothersome Person

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 823: Dealing with a Bothersome Person.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 823.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los An geles, California – oh, and the Center for Educational Development.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide.  I strongly recommend you take a look at the Learning Guide; it  contains a lot of good information that will help you improve your English .  Go to eslpod.com to download the one for this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Melissa and Cona n about someone who is bothering one of them, someone who is making proble ms for one of them.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa:  I hate that guy Reuben.  He’s always gett ing in my face.

Conan:  Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tension be tween the two of you.

Melissa:  Sexual tension?  Are you out of your mind ?  He does nothing but give me a hard time.

Conan:  That’s because he’s trying to get your atte ntion.

Melissa:  If he likes me, why doesn’t he try to get  my attention by showing off, like every other guy?

Conan:  Maybe he’s trying to stand out among your m any admirers.

Melissa:  Don’t be stupid.  I don’t have a lot of a dmirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable!

Conan:  Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he’ll s top his antics.

Melissa:  What kind of a bone?

Conan:  Ask him to the movies Saturday night.

 Melissa:  Me, ask him out?  You’re certifiable!

Conan:  I’m telling you that if you ask him out, he ’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa:  Putting aside the fact that I find him re pulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this place.

Conan:  I don’t think so.  He’ll get what he wants and he’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa:  What if it backfires and he bothers me ev en more?

Conan:  Then you’ll get what you want – deep down!

[end of dialogue]

Melissa begins by saying, “I hate that guy Reuben,”  meaning I hate that guy named Reuben – Reuben is his name.  Reuben is also a kind of sandwich, but I don’t think she’s talking about a sandwich.  No, sh e’s talking about that guy, Reuben.  Melissa says, “He’s always getting in my f ace.”  “To get in (someone’s) face” means to bother them, to annoy them.  It coul d also mean to challenge them, to disagree with them in order to make them a ngry.  “He was getting in my face,” we might say more informally, “he was gettin g up all in my face,” it’s the same thing.

Conan says, “Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tensi on between the two of you.” “To sense” (sense) means to perceive, to feel, to u nderstand.  “I sense there is something wrong here” means I think there is someth ing wrong, I don’t know for sure but from what I am seeing and hearing that’s, we might say, my impression – that’s my sense of what is going on.  Conan says that he senses some sexual tension.  “Sexual tension” would be when two people  are attracted to each other romantically, which in a strange way causes some un comfortable feelings between the two people.  The use of the word “serio us” here (serious) doesn’t mean serious in the sense of not funny or serious i n the sense of something that is very important.  Instead, it’s used here to mean  a lot; it’s a word used for emphasis.  You might think of it as meaning a lot o f.

Melissa says, “Sexual tension?  Are you out of your  mind?”  “To be out of your mind” means to be crazy, to be irrational, not to b e thinking properly or correctly. Melissa says, “He (Reuben) does nothing but give me  a hard time.”  The construction “he does nothing but” really means the  only thing he does is to give me a hard time.  “To give (someone) a hard time” me ans to either make it difficult

for that person to do something, or perhaps simply to make fun of that person. Here, it means the first meaning, to make difficult  for someone else.  Conan says, “That’s because he’s trying to get your atten tion.”  Conan says that Reuben is giving Melissa a hard time because he wants Meli ssa’s attention.  He wants Melissa to pay attention to him, to notice him, and  of course, ultimately, to like him.

Melissa says, “If he likes me, why doesn’t he try t o get my attention by showing off, like every other guy?”  “To show off” means to  try to get attention from other people by showing or saying how good you are: “Oh, I have such a nice car. Have you seen my new car?  It’s really nice.”  That  would be showing off. Usually, showing off is something that you actually  do.  For example, “Did I tell you I can speak in Swahili, Italian, and Chinese?”  And then you start speaking in those languages; that would be showing off.  You’re  trying to impress other people.  This is something, of course, that men do with women to try to get their attention.  When they’re interested in a woman they  may try to show off, and that’s what Melissa means when she says why doesn’t  Reuben try to get my attention by showing off, like every other guy – li ke every other man.  So I could say to a woman, “You know, I’m a podcaster.”  And y eah, that – that’ll impress a lot of women.  Yes it will!  I don’t need to impres s women because I’m married, but if I weren’t I could tell a women, “Hey, heh, I ’m a podcaster.  Yeah.”  Yeah, that’s impressive.  I’m just kidding, of course!

Conan says, “Maybe he’s trying to stand out among y our many admirers.” Conan is answering Melissa’s question about why Reu ben doesn’t show off like other guys.  He says that Reuben is trying to stand  out.  “To stand out” means to be different from the people around you, to be very  noticeable, to have other people pay attention to you and not pay attention t o the people around you. That’s to stand out.  “To stand” has several differ ent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  So, Conan thinks Reuben is trying to stand out among Melissa’s many admirers.  “To ad mire” (admire) means to like someone, to believe that person is a very good  person, to want to be like that person.  An “admirer,” with an “r” at the end, is s omeone who admires.  Often we use this term in a romantic sense, when a woman has  several men who are interested in her – who admire her.  We have anothe r expression: “a secret admirer.”  Somebody sends a woman a flower and they  don’t say what their name is.  They may say “your secret admirer,” someo ne who likes you but doesn’t want to give his name.

Melissa says, however, “Don’t be stupid,” meaning t hat’s stupid.  You’re being unintelligent.  You’re saying things that don’t mak e any sense.  “Don’t be stupid” is definitely an insulting thing to say to someone.   Melissa says, “I don’t have a lot

of admirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable!”  “Miserable” (miserable) means terrible, horrible.  Melissa does n’t want anyone who’s going to make her life terrible or miserable.

Conan says, “Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he ’ll stop his antics.”  “To throw (someone) a bone” (bone) means to give someon e a little encouragement, or to give someone a little reward for something go od they have done.  The expression probably comes from giving the bones of the meat that you eat to your dog.  Dogs like bones, I guess.  So, “to throw  (somebody) a bone” means to give them a small reward, something like a little g ift.  Conan is suggesting that Melissa do something nice for Reuben, and then mayb e Reuben will stop his antics.  “Antics” (antics) are silly, strange, unus ual behavior.  We often associate this word with children who are acting or behaving strangely, often to get the attention of their parents.

Melissa says, “What kind of a bone?” meaning how sh ould I reward him.  Conan says, “Ask him to the movies Saturday night,” ask h im to go to a movie with you. Melissa says, “Me, ask him out?”  “To ask someone o ut” means to ask them to go on a date.  Traditionally, the man asks the woma n to go on a date.  So Melissa can’t believe what Conan is suggesting.  In  fact, she says to Conan, “You’re certifiable!”  When you call someone “certi fiable” (certifiable) it here means crazy, insane, nuts.  Conan says, “I’m tellin g you that if you ask him out, he’ll stop pestering you.”  “To pester” (pester) me ans to bother or annoy someone.  If you say “stop pestering me,” you mean stop bothering me, stop annoying me.

Melissa says, “Putting aside the fact that I find h im repulsive,” meaning if we don’t even consider the fact that I find this perso n repulsive – and “repulsive” (repulsive) means unattractive, very disgusting, so mething you don’t want even to be close to.  Melissa says, “Putting aside the f act I find him repulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this pl ace.”  Someone who is the “laughingstock” (one word) is someone that everyone  laughs at, that everyone makes fun of.

Conan says, “I don’t think so.  He’ll get what he w ants and he’ll stop pestering you.”  Melissa asks, “What if it backfires and he b others me even more?”  For something “to backfire” (backfire – one word) is to  have the opposite results of what you expect.  So you tell your friend, “Oh, tha t’s a very good job you did,” and your friend gets angry at you; your friend yell s at you.  We would say that your compliment – the nice thing you said – backfir ed; somehow it had the opposite result that you wanted it or expected it t o have.  Melissa says what if me asking Reuben out on a date backfires; in other wor ds, instead of liking Melissa,

Reuben will start bothering her and pestering her e ven more.  Conan says, “Then you’ll get what you want – deep down!”  The phrase “deep down” means related to your very secret, inner feelings, how you really  think about something but you don’t want to tell anyone else.  So what Conan is s aying here is that really Melissa likes the fact that Reuben bothers her.  So  when Melissa says well, what if he bothers me even more, Conan says well, then y ou’ll get what you really want, because that’s what you really want deep down .  He’s saying that Melissa is also attracted to or romantically interested in Reuben.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa:  I hate that guy Reuben.  He’s always gett ing in my face.

Conan:  Ooh, I sense some serious sexual tension be tween the two of you.

Melissa:  Sexual tension?  Are you out of your mind ?  He does nothing but give me a hard time.

Conan:  That’s because he’s trying to get your atte ntion.

Melissa:  If he likes me, why doesn’t he try to get  my attention by showing off, like every other guy?

Conan:  Maybe he’s trying to stand out among your m any admirers.

Melissa:  Don’t be stupid.  I don’t have a lot of a dmirers and I don’t want one who makes my life miserable!

Conan:  Maybe if you throw him a bone, then he’ll s top his antics.

Melissa:  What kind of a bone?

Conan:  Ask him to the movies Saturday night.

Melissa:  Me, ask him out?  You’re certifiable!

Conan:  I’m telling you that if you ask him out, he ’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa:  Putting aside the fact that I find him re pulsive, if I ask him out, he’ll make me the laughingstock of this place.

 Conan:  I don’t think so.  He’ll get what he wants and he’ll stop pestering you.

Melissa:  What if it backfires and he bothers me ev en more?

Conan:  Then you’ll get what you want – deep down!

This episode is a dialogue about getting someone re ady to become the leader of a company or of an organization.  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Aisha:  It’s only a matter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.

Javier:  That won’t happen for years.

Aisha:  It’ll happen sooner than you think.  I’ve g iven a lot of thought to the person I want to fill my shoes.  After long conside ration, I think that person should be you.

Javier:  Me?  But there are a lot of people who out rank me in this organization and who have more experience.

Aisha:  That may be true, but I’ve decided to make you my protégé.  I’m taking you under my wing starting now to groom as my succe ssor.

Javier:  I don’t know what to say.  I’m honored, of  course, but aren’t you going to meet with a lot of resistance by choosing me instea d of someone more senior?

Aisha:  I might, but I have confidence in you.  Wit h a little time, you’ll come into your own and you’ll make a fine leader for this org anization.

Javier:  All I can say is thank you for having fait h in me.

Aisha:  The opportunity is yours and it’s up to you  what you make of it.

Javier:  I know that this is a once-in-a-lifetime o pportunity.  I won’t let you down.

Aisha:  I’m counting on that.

[end of dialogue]

Aisha begins our dialogue by saying, “It’s only a m atter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.”  The expressi on “it’s only a matter of time” is used to describe something that will definitely happen in the future but you don’t know exactly when, but it will happen.  “It’s  only a matter of time before Miss Universe calls me and asks me for some persona l English lessons.”  It’s only a matter of time; it will happen, I just don’t  know when.  Aisha says it’s only a matter of time before she retires.  “To retire” (re tire) means to stop working, basically to stop working for the rest of your life .  So when you are 65 or 70 you often – at least in the United States at those ages  – will retire; you will quit your job and you will no longer work full-time.  At leas t that’s the way it traditionally has been, we’ll see what happens in the future, dep ending on our economy.

Aisha is planning on retiring, and when she does sh e will hand over the reins (reins).  “To hand over (something)” is a phrasal v erb meaning to give something to someone else.  The “reins” – (reins), not (rains ) – is what you use to control a horse.  They’re the little ropes that you hold onto  that you use to control a horse, to turn it from one side to the other.  Here, it me ans the control of something, so Aisha will hand over control of the organization or  the company to someone else.

Javier says, “That won’t happen for years.”  You wo n’t be retiring for many years, he says.  Aisha, however, has different ideas.  She  says, “It will happen sooner than you think.”  She actually says, “It’ll happen, ” “it’ll” being a contraction for “it will.”  “It will happen sooner than you think,” soo ner than you might imagine.  She says, “I’ve given a lot of thought,” meaning I thou ght about something a lot, “I’ve given a lot of thought to the person I want to fill  my shoes.”  “To fill (someone’s) shoes” means to perform the same duties and the sam e activities as another person normally does.  So, when someone leaves as p resident, the next person becomes president fills his or her shoes; he does o r she does what that other person used to do.  Aisha says, “After long conside ration,” meaning after thinking about it very carefully for a long time, “I think t hat person should be you,” meaning you should be the next leader of this organ ization.

Javier says, “Me?”  He’s surprised.  I’m kind of su rprised, too.  Javier, eh, not that intelligent I don’t think!  Anyway, he says, “But t here are a lot of people who outrank me in this organization.”  “To outrank” (ou trank – one word) means to have a higher position or to have greater authority  in an organization.  So, a

company might have a president, it might have a cou ple of vice-presidents, and then it might have some managing directors.  Well, the president outranks the vice-president; he or she is higher in the organiza tion than the vice-president, and the vice-presidents outrank the managers.  Javi er is saying there are other people in this company who outrank him and who have  more experience.

Aisha says, “That may be true,” meaning maybe you’r e right, “but I’ve decided to make you my protégé.”  “Protégé” (protégé) is a per son who receives support, advice, and guidance from an older, more experience d person, especially as preparation for that person to take over the job of  the older person.  So someday when I get old – I mean really old, not old like I am now – someday when I get really old I will probably find a young version of me – a young Jeff McQuillan – and I will make him my protégé.  I will train that person so they can take over as ESL Podcast’s host many years now – many, many year s from now, however. Aisha says, “I’m taking you under my wing (Javier). ”  “To take (someone) under your wing” (wing) means to begin to make someone yo ur protégé, to begin to take that person and give them advice, give them su ggestions, give them guidance.  It’s something that an older person woul d do for a younger person in an organization.

Aisha’s going to take Javier under her wing, and sh e’s going to groom him as her successor.  “To groom” (groom) here means to prepar e another person to do a certain job, often your job.  It’s similar to takin g someone under your wing or making someone your protégé.  In this case, Aisha i s going to groom Javier as her successor (successor).  I should mention the wo rd “groom” has a couple of different meanings – very different.  Take a look a t our Learning Guide for those. I don’t want you to use that word in the wrong way,  take a look at the Learning Guide.  A “successor” is the person who takes over your job, the person who comes after someone else as the person taking that job.

Javier says, “I don’t know what to say.”  He’s surp rised.  He says, “I’m honored, of course,” meaning here sort of I’m flattered or I  feel very good about you telling me this, “but aren’t you going to meet with a lot o f resistance by choosing me instead of someone more senior?”  Javier is asking Aisha if she’s going to meet a lot of resistance, meaning people are going to oppo se her, people are going to be against her decision.  The reason they would be against her decision is because Javier is not the most senior person in the  company.  “Senior” (senior) here means to have more experience in the company.  Usually that means you’re older.  It doesn’t mean that you are what we call a  “senior citizen,” that would be someone over, say, 65 or 70 years old.  Here it jus t means someone with more experience at that organization, or in that organiz ation.

Aisha says, “I might, (I might meet some resistance ) but I have confidence in you.  With a little time, you’ll come into your own  and you’ll make a fine leader for this organization.”  The phrase “to come into your own” means to achieve the level of ability or competence in something that yo u are able to succeed at a job or succeed in a certain position.  “To come into yo ur own” means to mature, to get the necessary experience so that now you are re ady to do this job.

Javier says, “All I can say is thank you for having  faith in me.”  “To have faith (faith) in (someone)” means to believe in someone, to believe that someone can do something.

Aisha says, “The opportunity is yours and it’s up t o you what you make of it.” When we say something is “up to” someone – “it’s up  to you,” “it’s up to John,” “it’s up to Phil” – we mean that’s the person who h as the power to make something happen, to make something succeed or fail .  It’s the same as saying “it depends upon you” or “it depends on what you do .”  “It’s up to you to go and study harder to pass your test.”  It’s not somethin g I can do, it’s only something you can do; you’re the one that has that power.  Ai sha says it’s up to Javier what he makes of it.  The expression “what you make of ( something)” means what you do with an opportunity, how you take advantage of a  chance – an opportunity to do something.  “What will you make it?”  How will y ou use this opportunity?

Javier says, “I know that this is a once-in-a-lifet ime opportunity.”  “Once in a lifetime” means it only happens once in your entire  life.  Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would be an opportunity – a chance – th at will only happen once in your life.  Javier says, “I won’t let you down.”  “ To let (someone) down” (down) means to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s expectations.  Aisha says, “I’m counting on that.”  To count on (something)” m eans to rely on, to depend on something.  “I’m counting on you to finish this job .”  I’m relying on you; I’m depending on you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Aisha:  It’s only a matter of time before I retire and hand over the reins to someone else.

Javier:  That won’t happen for years.

Aisha:  It’ll happen sooner than you think.  I’ve g iven a lot of thought to the person I want to fill my shoes.  After long conside ration, I think that person should be you.

Javier:  Me?  But there are a lot of people who out rank me in this organization and who have more experience.

Aisha:  That may be true, but I’ve decided to make you my protégé.  I’m taking you under my wing starting now to groom as my succe ssor.

Javier:  I don’t know what to say.  I’m honored, of  course, but aren’t you going to meet with a lot of resistance by choosing me instea d of someone more senior?

This dialogue, in this episode, is about advertisin g in politics.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hilary:  The election is still two months away and I’m already sick of the political ads.  Look at these flyers we got in the mail just today, not to mention the canvassers ringing our doorbell nonstop!

Bill:  It’s worse if you watch TV, with attack ad a fter attack ad.  It’s gotten completely out of hand.

Hilary:  What happened to campaign finance reform?  After years of talking about it, we still have lots of political action committe es using soft money to finance media campaigns.

Bill:  You can’t even call them media campaigns any more.  They’re more like smear campaigns.  I’m fed up with all of this propa ganda.

Hilary:  You know what we should do?

Bill:  What?

Hilary:  We should take a vacation until the electi on is over…in Thailand!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Hilary – not Hillary Clint on, no relation – Hilary’s saying, “The election is still two months away and I’m alre ady sick of the political ads.” The “election” is the process of selecting someone for a public office typically.  In

a democracy people vote in the election, and the pe rson with the most votes wins.  Hilary, however, says that the election is s till two months away, meaning it’s two months from now.  She’s already sick of the political ads.  “To be sick of (something)” means to be tired of something.  This is different than saying “I’m sick.”  When you say “I’m sick” you mean you are ph ysically ill, there’s something wrong with your body – or perhaps your brain.  I th ink that’s my problem, the brain problem!  Anyway, “to be sick of (something)”  means to be tired of something; you no longer want to hear it or be part  of it.  Hilary is sick of political ads.  “Ads” is short for “advertisements.”  “Politi cal” relates, of course, to typically government offices – government offices and their e lections.  So, “political ads” would be advertisements you would see on the televi sion or hear on the radio, usually about one person who wants to president or senator or whatever the election is about.

Hilary says, “Look at these flyers we got in the ma il just today.”  A “flyer” (flyer) here means a piece of paper that has writing on it,  often some sort of picture or photograph, that’s used to describe either an event , or in this case, a certain political “candidate,” someone who is trying to get  elected to a job – a political job.  Hilary says, “Look at these flyers we got in the mail just today, not to mention the canvassers ringing our doorbell nonstop !”  A “canvasser” (canvasser) is a person who goes from one house to another, knocks on your door, or rings your doorbell, and tries to convince  you to vote for a certain person or perhaps to support a certain political cause.  T he “doorbell” is an electronic device that you can press that makes a noise and th at noise indicates there’s someone at your front door – the front door of your  house or apartment – who wants to get in or to talk to you.  The verb we use  when we make a sound with a bell is “ring,” and so we have the expression “to r ing a doorbell.”  To ring a doorbell “nonstop” would mean continuously, without  stopping, without a break. Anything you do nonstop is something that is done w ithout interruption.  When we talk about airplanes flying from one place to an other nonstop we mean they don’t stop in another city in between, they go dire ctly from one place to another.

Bill – no relation to Bill Clinton – Bill says, “It ’s worse if you watch TV, with attack ad after attack ad.”  An “attack (attack) ad” is a very usually negative political advertisement that criticizes very strongly one of the people in the election; usually one person will be criticizing the other pe rson.  They may be attacking their political positions, or they may be criticizi ng their personal behavior. American elections – unlike some elections in other  countries – is often very influenced by these personal issues.  Bill says, “I t’s gotten completely out of hand.”  The expression “out of hand” (hand) means o ut of control, there’s too much of something, it’s gone too far.  These attack  ads have gotten completely

out of hand, they’ve become too extreme, they’ve be come something that doesn’t have reasonable limits anymore.

Hilary says, “What’s happening to campaign finance reform?”  The expression “campaign finance reform” has three words: “campaig n,” which refers to the process of someone trying to get elected to a polit ical office; “finance,” which refers to money; and “reform,” which refers to tryi ng to change things.  Putting those three words together you get a term that is u sed to describe people’s efforts in the past several years in the U.S. to tr y to make elections more fair. Nowadays if you have a lot of money you have a bett er chance of being elected to a political office.  Campaign finance reform tri ed to equal the contributions, mostly by having the government give candidates mon ey to run for political office or limiting the amount of money you could spend.  I t hasn’t been very successful in the United States, but we won’t talk about that right now.

Hilary’s asking the question, “What happened to cam paign finance reform?  After years of talking about it, we still have lots of po litical action committees using soft money to finance media campaigns.”  Three terms the re: first, “political action committees” are organizations that take their money  and buy advertisements or try to influence the public about either a certain political issue or a certain political candidate, someone who’s trying to become governor or senator or president, whatever the elected office is.  Political action c ommittees are not under control of the person who’s running for president or runnin g for senator – who’s trying to become president, for example; political action com mittees are independent. “Soft money” is money that is donated to a politica l organization, but not directly to the candidate.  So it’s money you would give to a political action committee, which we often refer to by its acronym “PAC.”  You give money to a PAC, and that way you can avoid any legal limits on the amou nt of money you can give directly to a candidate.  Part of campaign finance reform in the United States involves limiting the amount of money any one perso n can give another person to run for office – to try to win an election.  But if  you give money to a PAC, you can avoid that limit; that’s why we call it “soft money ,” it’s easier to move around. “Media campaigns” refer to television advertisement s, Internet advertisements, radio ads; all of those are part of media campaigns .

Bill says, “You can’t even call them media campaign s anymore.  They’re more like smear campaigns.”  “To smear” (smear) as a ver b means to say something false about someone else, to say something bad abou t someone else that is not true, and by doing that you hurt that person’s repu tation.  You make people think that that person is a bad person; that’s to smear s omeone.  So, a “smear campaign” would be an organized, we might say “coor dinated,” effort to try to make another person look bad, especially in a polit ical campaign – in an election

campaign.  Bill says, “I’m fed up with all of this propaganda.”  “To be fed up” is a phrasal verb meaning to be very frustrated, to be t ired of something, to not want to have anything to do with this anymore.  You just  want it to stop.  Bill says he’s fed up with all of this propaganda.  “Propaganda” ( propaganda) is biased information that only gives one side of the story, or one perspective. Governments often use information to try to influen ce people, to create a certain impression, and when that information is either fal se or one-sided – that is, it doesn’t give a proper perspective, a proper view of  the whole situation, we might call that information propaganda.

Hilary says, “You know what we should do?”  Bill sa ys, “What?”  Hilary says, “We should take a vacation until the election is over,”  meaning we should leave, take a vacation until after the election is finished.  “ We should take a vacation until the election is over…in Thailand!” meaning they should go to the country of Thailand, they should leave the country so they would not hav e to hear anything more about the political campaign.  Unfortunately, nowad ays with the Internet it’s almost impossible to escape from the news of your c ountry even when you go to another country.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 828: Important Business Contacts.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 828. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there and take a look  at our special courses in business and daily English. I think you will enjoy them.

This episode is a dialog between Kelly and John, ta lking about people you know in the business world. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Kelly:  What we need are a few people in the indust ry to talk up our new company.

John:  I’m on top of that. I’m really well connecte d, as you know, and I’ve already put in a few calls to a few of the movers and shake rs in our business.

Kelly:  I didn’t know you had such a vast network o f contacts.

John:  Oh, sure I do. I don’t mean to name drop, bu t you know Kevin Martinez at McQ Corp? I’m pretty tight with him. And Eva Arriba s at Syntect? She and I go way back.

Kelly:  Wow, those are some heavy hitters!

John:  You’ve said it. And Kevin owes me one, and E va would bend over backwards for me.

Kelly:  It’s great! What did they say when you aske d them to get the word out about us?

John:  Um, I’m still waiting to hear back from them . I’m sure they’ll call back any day now.

[end of dialog]

Kelly begins our dialog by saying to John, “What we  need” – the thing we need – “What we need are a few people in the industry to t alk up our new company.” The “industry” (industry) could refer to any group of businesses that works in the same area. You could talk about the car manufacturi ng industry or the coal industry or the nuclear power industry or the podca st industry – any collection of companies, any area of business activity can be cal led an industry. Here in Los Angeles, however, when you say “the Industry,” you’ re usually referring to the entertainment industry – movie companies, televisio n studios, and so forth. People say, “Oh, yeah. He works in the Industry” – they mean he works in some connection to one of the entertainment companies he re in Hollywood.

Kelly says they need a few people in the industry t o “talk up” their new company. “To talk up” is a phrasal verb meaning to say good things about someone or something so that other people have a good opinion of it. “I’m going to talk up this new restaurant. It’s really great. I think you  should try it.” I’m saying good things about it to get other people to notice it, t o go there.

John says, “I’m on top of that.” The phrase “to be on top of something” means that you are actually and actively doing something,  that you don’t need any help from anyone else, that you have it – we might say –  “under control.” “I’m taking care of that” is what John is saying. He says, “I’m  really well connected.” “To be well connected” means that you have relationships w ith very important, powerful, influential people in your area. If someone says, “ Yeah, I’m very well connected in the Industry here in Los Angeles” – that would m ean they know famous movie stars or famous producers or directors. I, for exam ple, am not well connected in any industry.

John says, however, “I’m really well connected, as you know, and I’ve already put in a few calls to a few of the movers and shake rs in our business.” “To put in a few calls” means that you have telephoned a few p eople. You have made a couple of phone calls. “I’ve put in a few calls,” J ohn says, “to a few of” – some, a couple – “a few of the movers and shakers in our in dustry.” The expression “movers and shakers” (shakers) means people who are  very powerful, people who are very influential, people who make big impor tant decisions about something in your particular area.

Kelly says, “I didn’t know you had such a vast netw ork of contacts. “Vast” (vast) means very large, something that has a lot of diffe rent items or things in it. We might talk about the universe as being “vast” –it’s  huge, it’s really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really big – really  big – that’s vast. John says he has a “vast network.” A “network” (network) – one word – is a group of people who are connected to each other, usually, people who have s ome sort of common or

professional interest. I might have a network of pe ople who are language teachers – I don’t but I could – and if I did, that  would be a “network.”

“Contacts” (contacts) is in the title of this episo de – “Important Business Contacts.” “Contacts” are people with whom you have  some sort of professional relationship and can call on for advice. “I have “c ontacts” in the entertainment industry” – that means I know people. So, contacts,  really are people, but usually we use that word in talking about people who you ha ve some professional association with. However, contacts can also be use d to describe just anyone you know who’s telephone or address you have. Many phones – smart phones, computers – have software programs and part of the program or part of the software, I should say, often has a contact program  and the contacts are the people you know – their email addresses, their phon e numbers, etc. So, Kelly says, “I didn’t know you had such a vast network of  contacts.” John says, “Oh, sure I do. I don’t mean to name drop but you know K evin Martinez at McQ Corp? I’m pretty tight with him.” “To name drop” means to  mention the name of some important or famous person in a conversation so tha t the other person is impressed. They go, “Oh, wow. You know that person? ” For example, “Last night, I was having dinner with Brad Pitt and his w ife, Angelina Jolie, and I was telling them about ESL Podcast.” That would be an e xample of name dropping. I’m mentioning a famous person so that you will go,  “Oh, wow. You know Brad Pitt?” Well, that’s what the women would ask me. the men would ask me if I knew Angelina Jolie.

John says that he knows this famous person, Kevin M artinez. He says, “I’m pretty tight with him.” “To be tight (tight) with s omeone” means to have a very close relationship with them, to be friends with th em. John says, “And Eva Arribas at Syntect? She and I go way back.” The exp ression “to go way back” means that you’ve known them for a very long time. You’ve had a relationship with them, usually a professional relationship, wit h a person for a very long time. That’s what he means when he says, “She and I go wa y back.” Kelly says, “Wow. Those are some heavy hitters.” The expression “heav y hitter” (hitter) is similar to “movers and shakers.” “Heavy hitters” are people wh o have a lot of power, a lot of influence in a certain area.

John says, “You’ve said it.” That phrase, “You’ve s aid it” is use to show agreement with what the other person has just said.  We might also say, “Exactly!” or “Precisely!” So your friend says, “Th is is a delicious meal. This food tastes very good.” And you respond, “You’ve said it !” or “Exactly!” or “Precisely!” It means I agree with you completely. John says, “A nd Kevin owes me one. And Eva would bend over backwards for me.” “To owe (owe ) someone” means you owe that person a favor. You need to do something f or that person because they

did something for you. Well, John has done somethin g for Kevin, we don’t know what, but now Kevin has to do something for John.

This is a very powerful, social force of influence,  of course, what we call “reciprocity.” When I do something for you, then yo u do something for me. John also says that Eva would “bend over backwards” for him. “To bend (bend) over backwards (backwards)” means to do something, more than you might expect, especially when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. We  might say it’s to make an extreme effort, to do everything you possibly can f or this other person – to “bend over backwards.” Kelly says, “It’s great! What did they say when you asked them to get the word about us?” The expression “to get t he word out” – means to inform other people about something, to tell other people about something that is happening, something that is going on, to make sure  other people know about it.

Kelly is asking what these heavy hitters said to Jo hn. John says, “Um, I’m still waiting to hear back from them,” meaning they haven ’t returned his phone calls, they haven’t called him back. “I’m sure they’ll cal l back any day now.” The expression “any day now” means soon but you’re not exactly sure when. You think it will happen soon but you’re not sure. So, John has all these heavy hitting friends but they don’t call him back – maybe they’r e not really friends.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Kelly:  What we need are a few people in the indust ry to talk up our new company.

John:  I’m on top of that. I’m really well connecte d, as you know, and I’ve already put in a few calls to a few of the movers and shake rs in our business.

Kelly:  I didn’t know you had such a vast network o f contacts.

John:  Oh, sure I do. I don’t mean to name drop, bu t you know Kevin Martinez at McQ Corp? I’m pretty tight with him. And Eva Arriba s at Syntect? She and I go way back.

Kelly:  Wow, those are some heavy hitters!

John:  You’ve said it. And Kevin owes me one, and E va would bend over backwards for me.

Kelly:  It’s great! What did they say when you aske d them to get the word out about us?

John:  Um, I’m still waiting to hear back from them . I’m sure they’ll call back any day now.

[end of dialog]

She’s a heavy hitter when it comes to writing dialo gs. She’s a mover and shaker in the world of language teaching. I’m speaking of course, of the well connected, Dr. Lucy Tse.

# Having a Barbecue

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 829: Having a Barbecue.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 829. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in Los Angeles, California. Why am I speaking so stran gely? I don’t know. I’m sorry – didn’t have enough coffee this morning.

This episode is a dialog between George and Sophia.  They’re going to be cooking. They’re going to be having a barbecue. Let ’s get started!

[start of dialog]

George:  Step aside! The king of the cookout is her e. I’m ready to work my magic on this barbecue.

Sophia:  Here are the burgers and hot dogs. The kid s are pretty hungry.

George:  Hold on. I need to put on the charcoal. No w I’m ready to fire up this barbecue. Where’s the lighter fluid?

Sophia:  It’s right here.

George:  Good. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ll need to ga ther some wood to burn to give the meat that smoky flavor.

Sophia:  Why don’t I do that while you get things g oing?

George:  No, I need to do things my way. I also nee d to make my world-famous barbecue sauce. The meat won’t taste very good if I  don’t baste it with my special sauce each time I flip it.

Sophia:  Okay, how about if I get the corn on the c ob ready for grilling?

George:  I’ll do that. I have my own special way of  preparing the corn.

Sophia:  Is there anything I can do to hurry things  along?

 George:  Perfection takes time. Would you tell Mich elangelo to hurry up?

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with George saying, “Step aside!”  That expression, “Step aside (aside),” is used when you are telling someone to m ove out of your way, to move so that you can walk through a certain area or you can be in a certain area. George is saying, “Move over! The king of the cooko ut is here.” “The king of” is used when a man thinks he’s the best person in some  area. He’s the expert. “I’m the king of poker players.” “I’m the king of podcas ters.” “I’m the king of the world” – well, that was in Titanic . Remember the movie, Titanic ? Yeah. Anyway, that’s what we mean. “I’m the king of.” I’m the most power ful person or the most knowledgeable or expert person in this area. A woma n would say, “I’m the queen of something.”

George is the king of “cookouts.” A “cookout” (cook out) is an event where food is cooked, usually outside – outside of a house or a b uilding. And it’s cooked over an open fire. We would say it’s “grilled,” so that you have these little bars of metal and the fire underneath and you put the food on top  of the bars of metal – the “grill” – that’s a “cookout.” George says, “I’m rea dy to work my magic on this barbecue.” The expression “to work your magic” mean s I’m going to do something very well. I’m going to do something bett er than anyone else can do.

A “barbecue” is a large device that is used to cook  outside. It has a grill on it. You can either use gas, which is very popular nowadays,  but the traditional way is to use small pieces of charcoal that you light on fire  and then the charcoal gets hot and that cooks the food, that provides the heat. So , a barbecue can refer to that device, that thing that you use to cook with. Somet imes, it’s just used to describe a cookout, a party. “We’re going to have a barbecue ,” meaning we’re going to have a meal where we cook outside on a barbecue. Th is is often abbreviated – “barbecue” (barbecue) – with three letters capitali zed – “BBQ.”

Sophia says, “Here are the burgers and hotdogs. The  kids are pretty hungry.” “Burgers” refers to hamburgers, “hotdogs” are hotdo gs, and those are popular things to cook at a barbecue, in addition to ribs a nd chicken. “The kids are pretty hungry,” Sophia says, meaning the kids are very hun gry. George says, “Hold on,” meaning wait, “I need to put on the charcoal. Now, I’m ready to fire up this barbecue. Where’s the lighter fluid?” Remember I sa id there is sort of a traditional way of doing barbecues where you use li ttle pieces of charcoal, basically. What you do is you put the charcoal (cha rcoal) inside the barbecue, then you put on lighter fluid. “Lighter fluid” is a  liquid that you pour over the

charcoal that causes it to burn when you put fire o n there. “To fire up” would mean to light something, to start a fire burning. A nd so, what you’re doing is you are lighting up the pieces of charcoal so they’ll g et hot and once they get hot, then you can food on top of the grill and cook it.

George is firing up the barbecue. He’s asking for t he lighter fluid and Sophia says, “It’s right here.” George says, “Good. Oh, I almost forgot. I’ll need to gather some wood” – I’ll need to get some wood – “to burn to give the meat that smoky flavor.” “Smoky” (smoky) means a lot of smoke – the  gray colored air that comes from burning something with a fire, basically. And that’s popular in barbecues, to want to have, for some things, a smoky flavor. Ther e’re different ways of getting that. Burning wood is one of them. I think you can actually buy charcoal that’s somehow flavored and when you use it, it produces t hat smoky effect or result.

Sophia says, “Why don’t I do that while you get thi ngs going?” Sophia’s saying, “I’ll go get the wood. You start the barbecue.” Geo rge says, “No. I need to do things my way,” meaning I need to do things the way  I want to do them. “I also need to make my world famous barbecue sauce.” “Worl d famous” means everyone in the world knows about it. A “barbecue s auce” (sauce) – is a thick liquid you put on top of the meat that you’re cooki ng that gives it a very certain barbecue taste. I’m not sure how to describe. It’s usually made with something a little sweet.

George says, “The meat won’t taste very good if I d on’t baste it with my special sauce each time I flip it.” “To baste” (baste) mean s to use a small tool. It looks often like a brush – to put the sauce, this heavy o r thick liquid, over the food so that it doesn’t become too dry. George needs to “ba ste” the meat with his special sauce each time he “flips it.” “To flip” (flip) her e means to turn something over. So, if you’re cooking a hamburger, you cook one sid e, and then you flip it over, you turn it over and cook the other side. Sometimes , jokingly, we talk about people who work in hamburger restaurants like McDon ald’s as “flipping burgers.” The term is used to describe a job that doesn’t pay  very well and is probably not the most interesting.

Sophia says, “Okay, how about if I get the corn on the cob ready for grilling?” “Corn on the cob” is corn, the vegetable, that come s still attached to the hard inedible – what you don’t eat – part of the plant. If you know what corn looks like, when you take it off the plant. Well, you take the outside of the corn off – what we call the “husk” (husk) – and you’re left with the “ corn on the cob (cob).” The “cob” is the middle part of the plant, the hard part that  you don’t eat. “Grilling,” you already know, means to cook something on top of thi s metal device.

So “grill” can be a noun but here it’s used as a ve rb. It means basically the same as barbecuing, in this instance. George says, “I’ll  do that. I have my own special way of preparing corn.” Sophia says, “Is there anyt hing I can do to hurry things along?” Remember the children are hungry and George  is taking a long time. So Sophia says she wants to “hurry things along” – tha t means to speed things up, to make things happen more quickly. George says, “P erfection takes time.” “Perfection” is when you can’t do anything any bett er than it is. It’s without any mistakes.

George says, “Would you tell Michelangelo to hurry up?” Michelangelo, you probably know, is the – or was – the influential It alian Renaissance artist who painted the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican in Rome. He created the statue of David in Florence, Italy, and so forth. Michelangel o here is used to mean an artist, a great artist, and George thinks of himsel f as a great artist. We also, if we’re trying to describe someone who’s brilliant, s omeone who’s intellectually a genius, we would say, “He’s an Einstein.” Well, Geo rge is saying he’s a Michelangelo – he’s a great artist as a cook.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

George:  Step aside! The king of the cookout is her e. I’m ready to work my magic on this barbecue.

Sophia:  Here are the burgers and hot dogs. The kid s are pretty hungry.

George:  Hold on. I need to put on the charcoal. No w I’m ready to fire up this barbecue. Where’s the lighter fluid?

# Donating to a Thrift Store

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 830: Donating to a Thrift Store.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 830. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California – home of Hollywo od, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers – my favorite baseball team.

This episode – like all of our episodes – has a Lea rning Guide. Go to eslpod.com for more information.

We’re going to hear a dialogue between Scott and Na ncy about giving things to something called a “thrift store” – a store that se lls used things. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Scott:  That’s the last bag. Help me put these into  the truck. I want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day.

Nancy:  Hold on! That bag has curtains in it.

Scott:  I know they do. Those old curtains have bee n sitting around in the closet for 10 years. It’s time to let them go.

Nancy:  But what about this bag? These are the chil dren’s old baby clothes. You can’t just toss these! They have such sentimental v alue.

Scott:  You’ve kept a lot of the children’s old clo thes already, but we still have bags and bags of them in the attic.

Nancy:  Yes, but they’re so cute.

Scott:  It’s time to put aside sentiment and do som e spring cleaning. After all, we’re donating them to a good cause. Families visit ing the thrift store can buy them for their own children. We get a tax deduction  and our items get a new life. It’s a win-win for everybody.

Nancy:  I don’t know about that. What?! You’re not getting rid of those chairs, are you? They still have a lot of life in them.

Scott:  Our garage is so full of old furniture that  we don’t use. I’m putting my foot down. These have to go.

Nancy:  But not those...

Scott:  Yes, those and those and those. This is my punishment for marrying a pack rat!

[end of dialogue]

Scott begins by saying, “That’s the last bag. Help me put these into the truck.” A truck is a large vehicle like a car. Scott says, “I  want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day.” A “ thrift (thrift) store” is a store that sells old things – by old I mean used. You might ha ve a book or a pair of shoes or some dishes from your kitchen that you don’t wan t anymore. Well, you can give them to this store – this thrift store – and t hey will sell them. Most of the thrift stores are owned by organizations – what we would c all “charitable organizations.” “Charitable” (charitable) means the y’re not trying to make money – these organizations, these charitable organizatio ns – they’re trying to help other people. And so, they get money by selling the se old things that people give them to sell. And that’s the next word we have here  in the sentence – “donations.” A “donation” (donation) is something y ou give to an organization so that it can be used to help that organization. In t his case, the donations are the things that you give to the thrift store so they ca n sell it and get money.

Nancy says, “Hold on! Wait! That bag has curtains i n it.” “Curtains” (curtains) are large pieces of cloth or fabric that we use to cove r a window so that no one can see inside of your house, or if you like to sleep u ntil 10 o’clock in the morning, you want curtains to prevent the light from coming in. I don’t sleep until 10 o’clock. I get up pretty early actually – usually a round 6, 6:30 – not that early but pretty early. Scott says, “I know they do” -  I kno w this bag contains curtains. “Those old curtains have been sitting around in the  closet for 10 years.” When we say something has been “sitting around” – that two- word phrasal verb means to be somewhere but not actually doing anything import ant. It’s just taking up space. “We were sitting around in the living room, waiting for the baseball game to begin.” We were sitting around. We weren’t doing  anything very important. You can have a book that’s been sitting around your off ice for a year and you have not read it yet. It just sits there. It doesn’t do anything important or you haven’t done anything important with it.

Scott says that the curtains that he wants to give to the thrift store have been sitting “around” in the closet for ten years. Notic e that even though “around” is a

preposition, it’s part of the two-word phrasal verb  – “sitting around” or “to sit around” – so you can put another preposition to say  where something has been sitting around. It’s a little unusual. Well, Scott says, “These curtains have been sitting around in the closet (closet).” A “closet” is something that is usually built-in to the house. It’s like this little room where you can put things to store them – to keep them. You can have a closet for your clothes i n a bedroom or you could have a closet in your house to put other things lik e vacuum cleaners and old boxes and I don’t know – things you use to clean the house. I don’t clean the house. My wife usually cleans the house. I know, I know, I should help. I have other things I do. I cut the grass. I do the lawn o utside so, I help, don’t worry.

Anyway, Scott says, “It’s time to let them go” – le t the curtains go. “To let something go” means to agree not to have it anymore  or to let someone else take it because you no longer need it or you no lon ger should have it. “He’s going to let the curtains go.” Nancy says, “What about th is bag? These are the children’s old baby clothes.” Some people keep thei r children’s clothes even after the children don’t need them anymore. I don’t know why. Anyway, Nancy has done this and she says, “You can’t just toss these. ” “To toss” (toss) means to throw something away – to get rid of something, to put something in the trash. Nancy says, these baby clothes have “sentimental va lue.” “They have such sentimental value,” she says. “Sentimental (sentime ntal) value” is the feeling of wanting to keep an object because it has certain sp ecial memories for you. It’s not worth anything. It’s not like a gold ring that you can sell but it has some sort of emotional feelings attached to it. You have some  emotional memories associated with it. The first love note that your n ow-husband or wife gave you – that might be something that has sentimental value.  It’s not valuable because the piece of paper is valuable but what is associated w ith that piece of paper – what you have memories about.

Scott says, “You’ve kept a lot of the children’s ol d clothes already. But we still have bags and bags of them in the attic.” The “atti c” (attic) is the very top of the house. Many Americans live in houses that have more  than one storey and even those that are just one storey – one level – usuall y, the house will have an attic. It will have a storage area at the very top. That’s wh at Scott is referring to. People sometimes use the attic as a place to store things,  to keep boxes, for example. Nancy says, “Yes, but they’re so cute.” She doesn’t  want to get rid of her children’s old clothes. Scott says, however, “It’s time to put aside sentiment and do some spring cleaning. “ To put aside” (aside) is  a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to separate something from a group because you want to use it for some particular purpose. For example, “My mother ma kes ten cookies for us to eat. But she puts aside two of those for my father who hasn’t come home yet.” Usually, my father wouldn’t get any cookies if my m other gave them because we

would eat them before he came. So, my mother would have to “put them aside.” She would have to remove them, put them in another place so that we wouldn’t eat them.

Scott says, “It’s time to put aside sentiment.” We need to not worry about or not have these sentimental values about things and do s ome “spring cleaning.” “Spring cleaning” is a time, usually during the spr ing of the year between the winter and the summer, when people go and they clea n their house – they organize things, they get rid of things they don’t need any more. Scott says, “After all, we’re donating them to a good cause” – for a good purpose. “Families visiting the thrift store can buy them for their ow n children. We get a tax deduction and our items get a new life.” When you g ive money to a charitable organization in the United States – like a thrift s tore – you can take what’s called a “tax deduction.” You can take the value of that d onation and use it to reduce the amount of taxes you owe at the end of the year.  Scott says, “It’s a win-win for everybody.” A “win-win” (win) is a situation that b enefits both people involved in the transaction – in the exchange. You get somethin g, I get something – it’s win- win. This is an expression that started to be used in the business world – I don’t know, 20, 25 years ago.

Nancy says, “I don’t know about that.” I’m not sure . Then she says, “What? You’re not getting rid of those chairs are you? The y still have a lot of life in them.” Now she sees that Scott is trying to donate some ch airs. She says, “These chairs still have a lot of life in them,” meaning they’re still useful, we could still use them. Scott says, “Our garage is full of old furniture th at we don’t use. I’m putting my foot down. These have to go.” “To put your foot dow n” means that you are insisting – you are saying, “This is my decision. I  am not going to change it.” My wife said, “We’re going to the movies tonight” and I say, “No. I’m going to put my foot down. We’re not going to the movies.” Well, we , of course, went to the movies.

Scott says, “These have to go.” Nancy says, “But no t those.” Scott says, “Yes, those and those and those.” He’s pointing to all of  the things they have to donate to the thrift store. Scott says, “This is my punish ment for marrying a “pack rat.” A “pack (pack) rat (rat)” is a person who likes to ke ep everything – who doesn’t throw anything away. Old clothes, old papers, old b ooks – all of these things they keep. They don’t give them away, they don’t donate them, they don’t throw them away. They keep them. That’s what we call a “pack r at.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Scott:  That’s the last bag. Help me put these into  the truck. I want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day.

Nancy:  Hold on! That bag has curtains in it.

Scott:  I know they do. Those old curtains have bee n sitting around in the closet for 10 years. It’s time to let them go.

# Not the Marrying Kind

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 831: Not the Marrying Kind.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 831. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los An geles, California. I still need a song for the opening. I need some sort of music for  that “from beautiful Los Angeles, California” part. We have a beautiful webs ite at eslpod.com. Go there, join ESL Podcast, and download the eight- to ten-pa ge Learning Guide we have for each of our episodes.

This episode is called “Not the Marrying Kind.” It’ s a dialogue about a man who doesn’t seem to want to get married. Let’s get star ted!

[start of dialogue]

Stacey:  I have a date with George this Saturday. I  can’t wait!

Brad:  Have a good time, but you know what the word  on the street is about George, don’t you?

Stacey:  What?

Brad:  He’s not the marrying kind.

Stacey:  Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl yet.  When he does, he’ll be ready to settle down.

Brad:  I don’t think so. Women who have gone out wi th him have told me that he’s up front with them:  he has no intention of ty ing the knot – ever.

Stacey:  Do you think he’s a commitment phobe?

Brad:  I have no idea. I just know that he likes to  play the field and anyone who dates him should not try to reform him.

Stacey:  I wouldn’t try to reform him. I think he’l l just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him.

Brad:  Don’t count on it.

Stacey:  I’m convinced of it.

Brad:  I’m always surprised by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love!

[end of dialogue]

Stacey is talking with Brad and she says, “I have a  date with George this Saturday.” A “date” (date) is when you have a roman tic evening or afternoon with someone – you go somewhere with someone – usually i t’s romantic. Sometimes “date” can just mean an appointment. But here it me ans a romantic time together. Stacey says, “I can’t wait.” I’m really l ooking forward to this date. Brad says, “Have a good time. But you know what the word  on the street is about George don’t you?” The expression “the word on the street” means what people are saying about something even though they don’t h ave proof that it’s true – here’s what people are talking about, here’s what p eople are saying about this thing or this person. Often it just means a rumor ( rumor). Stacey says, “What?” Brad says, “Well, the word on the street about Geor ge is that he’s not the marrying kind.” The expression “not the marrying (m arrying) kind” means he’s a person who’s not interested in getting married. He wants to remain single. Usually, this is said about a man. Sometimes it cou ld be said about a woman as well. “He’s not the marrying kind.” We might also s ay, “He’s not the marrying type (type).” It means the same thing. He’s not a person  that will want to get married.

Stacey says, “Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl  yet.” He hasn’t met the right person for him. That’s what all women believe that even men who are not the marrying kind will marry them because they are the perfect woman for them. Stacey says, “When he does” – when he does meet the  right girl or the right woman – “he’ll be ready to settle down.” The phrasa l verb “to settle (settle) down” means to begin to live a quiet, calm life. Usually,  it’s an expression we use when we are talking about someone in their, say, 20’s or  perhaps 30’s who’s now ready to get married. They were single for a long t ime. They like to go out and party and enjoy themselves. But now the fun must en d and they get married. No, I’m just kidding. Getting married is fun, too, kids !

Brad disagrees with Stacey. He doesn’t think that G eorge is ready to settle down and get married. Brad says, “Women who have gone ou t with him – meaning who have gone on dates with him – have told me that  he’s upfront with them.” To be “upfront” means to be direct, to be honest, to b e straightforward – you’re not hiding anything, you’re not trying to be secret. We  use this term, usually, when we are trying to tell someone something that perhap s is difficult for them to hear or that they don’t want to hear and we want to be h onest with them – we want to

tell them right away. Brad says that George has bee n upfront with women. “He has no intention of tying the knot – ever.” “Intent ion” (intention) is what you plan to do. It’s what your plan is, what your goal or yo ur aim (aim) is. Brad says, “George has no intention – he has no plans to tie ( tie) the knot (knot).” The expression “to tie the knot” means to get married. It’s very common in American English. A “knot” is normally something, for exampl e, when you have shoes that have shoelaces, you tie a knot so that your shoes d on’t fall off. Well, here it means to tie a knot – I guess to your husband or yo ur wife, so that you won’t be separated. It’s kind of like going to jail – kind o f like prison – where I suppose in the old days, they would tie a knot around someone’ s hands so they couldn’t move – that’s marriage, basically.

Stacey asks, “Do you think he’s a commitment phobe? ” “Commitment” is when you agree to do something with someone or you simpl y agree to do something – it’s like a promise. “Phobe” (phobe) refers to some one who’s afraid of something. So, a commitment phobe would be someone who’s afrai d of commitment – who doesn’t want to promise to do something like get ma rried. Brad says, “I have no idea” – I don’t know. “I just know – I only know – that he likes to play the field.” The expression “to play the field” describes, usual ly, a man who likes to date many different people – a person who doesn’t want t o just have one long-term relationship – romantic relationship. Sometimes we describe informally someone as being a “player” (player). The idea is similar –  someone who likes to have usually different girlfriends – he plays the field.  “Anyone who dates George,” Brad continues, “should not try to reform him.” “To refo rm (reform) someone” – or something – means to fix it, to change it, to make it better. Women often think they can change a man. They can reform him, they ca n make him different for what he really is. This is a common belief among ma ny women who get married. Is it true? Well, sometimes.

Stacey says, “I won’t try to reform him. I think he ’ll just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him.” The expression “to fall head over heels (heels) in love with someone” means  to have a sudden strong romantic interest in someone. It’s – I suppose – re lated a little bit to “love at first sight (sight),” where you see someone – you see a b eautiful woman across the room or a beautiful man – a handsome man – and you fall in love with them. You fall “head over heels in love.”

To fall head over heels doesn’t mean it happens the  first time you see them. That would be the expression “love at first sight.” But it could happen. You fall head over heels with someone the first time you see them . Stacey says that she thinks after George falls in love with her that he’ll put his “philandering ways behind him.” “Philander” (philander) means that a man goes  out and has romantic

relationships with different women – typically sexu al relationships with different women. He’s not interested in having a relationship  with only one woman. Often, the man will be lying about his relationships to the women that he is with. That’s the way men are sometimes, unfortunately. Stacey sa ys that she thinks George will put his “philandering ways” – ways (ways) here  means habits – “he will put his philandering ways behind him.” To put something  “behind you” or “behind him” means to forget about it, to no longer do that  thing. Brad says, “Don’t count on it.” “To count on something” means to depend on to rely on something, to believe something is true. Brad says, “Do not count  on it” – don’t expect that to happen. Stacey says, “I’m convinced of it” – I’m pe rsuaded, I believe it is true.

Brad says, “I’m always surprised by the degree to w hich women can delude themselves when it comes to love.” “I’m always surp rised” –It always surprises me – this is an expression we use when we are talki ng about something perhaps that we don’t understand, but also as a way of emph asizing to the other person how we have a very different opinion than they do a bout something or how unusual we think their opinion or their action is. Brad says, “I’m always surprised the degree – the extent, the amount – to which wome n can delude themselves.” “To delude” (delude) means to lie and cause others to believe those lies. In this case, the women are deluding themselves – they’re l ying to themselves. They are trying to persuade themselves of something that  they know isn’t really true. So when you delude yourself, you are lying to yours elf because you don’t want to accept the reality – the truth. Brad says, “I’m alw ays surprised by the degree – by how much – by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love.” The expression “when it comes to” –  means concerning, regarding, in relation to, or about. Of course, thi s woman – Stacey – thinks she can reform George and Brad is saying, “No, that’s n ot going to be possible. You’re deluding yourself.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Stacey:  I have a date with George this Saturday. I  can’t wait!

Brad:  Have a good time, but you know what the word  on the street is about George, don’t you?

Stacey:  What?

Brad:  He’s not the marrying kind.

Stacey:  Oh, he just hasn’t met the right girl yet.  When he does, he’ll be ready to settle down.

Brad:  I don’t think so. Women who have gone out wi th him have told me that he’s up front with them:  he has no intention of ty ing the knot – ever.

Stacey:  Do you think he’s a commitment phobe?

Brad:  I have no idea. I just know that he likes to  play the field and anyone who dates him should not try to reform him.

Stacey:  I wouldn’t try to reform him. I think he’l l just fall head over heels in love with me and he’ll put his philandering ways behind him.

Brad:  Don’t count on it.

Stacey:  I’m convinced of it.

Brad:  I’m always surprised by the degree to which women can delude themselves when it comes to love!

# Creating an Online Store

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 832: Creating an Online Store

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  832. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Our website is E SLPod.com. Go there to become a member, and get a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog about creating or opening a new store online, on the I Internet. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Kay:  I’d say we’re well on our way to establishing  our new online store.

Greg:  I can’t wait for this to get off the ground.  Orders will pour in and we’ll make money hand over fist.

Kay:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see w here we are in our preparations.

Greg:  All right. We’ve created a marketing plan th at includes several ways to drive traffic to our website.

Kay:  That’s great. We’ve also installed a shopping  cart and a secure way to process orders.

Greg:  We can use that system to track orders, righ t?

Kay:  That’s right. All customer information will b e captured and we’ll have a database of information we can mine later.

Greg:  That’s great. We already have a place to hou se the inventory and a way to track it.

Kay:  Right you are. Now all we need is one last th ing.

Greg:  We need to find a product to sell.

Kay:  Yeah. Any ideas?

Greg:  No, none. You?

Kay:  Nope. But as soon as we do, we’ll be the next  big thing in ecommerce.

Greg:  Definitely!

[end of dialogue]

Kate starts by saying, “I’d say” – “I would say,” m eaning here, “I think” – “we’re well on our way to establishing our new online stor e.” “We’re well on our way” means we are well on our way and that means that we  are making good progress toward something. We’re getting closer to our goal, to finishing – in this case, this new project of establishing or starting an online store, a website basically on the Internet where you sell things. Gr eg says, “I can’t wait for this to get off the ground.” When someone says, “I can’t wa it for something” they mean they’re very excited about it. Greg can’t wait for this online store to “get off the ground” (ground). “To get something off the ground”  means to begin something – usually a project – to start something for the firs t time. Greg says, “orders” – people buying things – “orders will pour in and we’ ll make money hand over fist.” The expression “to pour (pour) in” means to receive  a lot of something, especially money, but it could be letters or emails. We could say, “The money is pouring in from our new product” – our new thing that we are s elling on the Internet. Greg thinks money will pour in and that they will “make money hand over fist” (fist). The expression “to make money hand over fist” means  to make a lot of money, to get very rich by doing something. Someone’s making money hand over fist.

Kay says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.” The e xpression “to get ahead of yourself,” or “to get ahead of ourselves,” means to  get so excited about something that we begin to think about all the wond erful things that will happen in the future and not focus on preparing for what’s ha ppening right now. “To get ahead of yourself” would mean to start making plans , for example, about how you’re going to spend your money that you are going  to get from your new online website – online store, rather – before you’ve actu ally started the business. That’s getting ahead of yourself. Or you see a beau tiful woman and you start thinking about how you’re going to marry her and ha ve children and you don’t even have her telephone number yet. Kay says, “Let’ s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see where we are in our preparatio ns.” “Let’s see where we are,” meaning let’s look at where we are currently – what  we are doing now – for our preparations.

 Greg says, “All right. We’ve created a marketing pl an that includes several ways to drive traffic to our website.” A “marketing plan ” is a plan about how you’re going to go out and find customers and get them to buy your product. “Driving traffic” means encouraging people to visit your web site or to go to your store. On the Internet, it means to get people – we call them  “visitors” – to come to your website and look at it and hopefully buy something from it. Kay says, “That’s great. We’ve also installed a shopping cart and a s ecure way to process orders.” “To install (install)” means to connect or to put s omething in somewhere. It could be something physical like, for example, I need a n ew water heater in my house so I ask a plumber – a person who deals with things  like water heaters – to come in and install it in my house, to connect it, to pu t it in. We also use this verb in talking about computer programs, computer software,  which are installed on a computer or on a computer that is running a website .

In this case, the software that is installed was a “shopping cart.” On a website, a “shopping cart” is a piece of software that allows you to look at things that are being sold and to buy them. It’s sort of a part of the website that you actually use to buy something. If you go to a real physical stor e like a grocery store, where you buy food, you also have a shopping cart. It’s t hat thing that you push around that you put the food into so you don’t have to car ry it in your hands. On a website, however, a shopping cart is the part of the website used to buy things.

Kay says they have “installed a shopping cart and a  secure way to process orders.” “Secure” (secure) means safe. And on the I nternet, it means a place where your information, your name, your credit card , your address, will be safe – it won’t get stolen, someone won’t come and take it  and use it somewhere else. Kay says they have a secure way “to process orders. ” “To process (process) orders” means that you receive orders that people g ive you, that is, things that they want to buy – that’s what an order is. You say , “I want to buy this.” “To process” them means to take care of them, to figure  out who’s going to get what and so forth. In an online store, sometimes you are  buying things that the company will send you in the mail. Sometimes, you’r e simply buying things that you download onto your computer.

Greg says, “We can use that system to track orders,  right?” “To track (track) orders” means to make sure you know what’s going on  with the order at all times – whether it was paid for, whether it was shipped –  that is, whether it was sent to the person who bought. In some cases, whether the p erson received it – all of that would be part of “tracking an order.” “Process ing the order” means getting it ready to send; “tracking the order” means knowing w hat part of the process you are in.

 Kay says, “That’s right. All customer information w ill be captured and we’ll have a database of information we can mine later.” “To cap ture” (capture) here means to record, to save that information from the customer.  “Capture” has a number of different meanings in English. Take a look at our L earning Guide for some of those. Kay says they also have a “database” (databa se). A “database” is a computer program that saves and organizes informati on for you. “To mine” (mine) here – when we’re talking about websites and  databases – means to analyze a large amount of information, a large amou nt of data to find interesting patterns. So, you might want to know whether people  from this country are buying more on a weekend than people from that coun try. You can look at your database – your set of information – and “mine” it.  You could go in and try to find information by using other computer software.

Greg says, “That’s great. We already have a place t o house the inventory and a way to track it.” “To house (house) something” mean s to store it, to keep it until you are ready to use it. So, if you’re selling book s on your website, you would need a place to house the physical books. You need a place to keep them. The “inventory” (inventory) refers to all of the things  that you are selling – usually physical things. So, your inventory would be all of  the books that you have that you are selling on your website or all of the compu ters you have that you are selling on your website.

Kay says, “Right you are,” meaning that’s correct. “Now all we need is one last thing” – one final thing. Greg says, “We need to fi nd a product to sell.” Of course, normally when you have a store you know what you’re  going to sell but Greg and Kay have built a website but they don’t have anythi ng to sell yet. Kay says, “Yeah, any ideas?” Greg says, “No, none. You?” mean ing “Do you?” Kay says, “Nope” – an informal way of saying no. “But as soon  as we do, we’ll be the next big thing in ecommerce.” “The next big thing” is the most recent thing to become popular that everyone is talking about. So, a few y ears ago it was Facebook and then it was Twitter and then it was – I don’t know,  Pinterest. Whatever the next most popular thing is that’s “the next big thing.” “Ecommerce” (ecommerce) refers to selling things on the Internet – Internet  selling and buying.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kay:  I’d say we’re well on our way to establishing  our new online store.

 Greg:  I can’t wait for this to get off the ground.  Orders will pour in and we’ll make money hand over fist.

Kay:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see w here we are in our preparations.

# Shooting Travel Videos

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 833: Shooting Travel Videos.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  833. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Visit our websit e at ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL Podcast and get the Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog between Matilda and Cesar regarding going on a trip and making some videos. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don ’t leave right now.

Matilda:  I’m just getting some footage of this are a before we leave. “This area is known for its...”

Cesar:  Now what are you doing?

Matilda:  I’m doing a voice-over for this segment. Voice-overs are very important in good travel videos.

Cesar:  You can add the voice-over when you edit it . Let’s go!

Matilda:  Just give me five more minutes. Hmm, this  footage is turning out to be too shaky. Hold on while I set up the tripod.

Cesar:  We don’t have time for that. Grab your camc order, and let’s go.

Matilda:  Too much motion will ruin any travel vide o. Wait! I want to get a close- up of that building and a wide-angle shot of this e ntire area. Hey, where are you going with my gear?

Cesar:  I, and your gear, are going to the tour bus . I’m not going to get left behind – again!

[end of dialogue]

Cesar begins our dialogue by saying to Matilda, “Hu rry up!” “Hurry up” means go faster, you’re moving too slowly. “Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don’t leave right now.” “We’ll miss” means we won’t be ab le to get on the tour bus because it will leave without us. A “tour bus” is a  large bus that carries many people, sometimes twenty, thirty, or more people. A nd it takes you on some sort of tour. So, you go around and you learn about diff erent things or perhaps, you go from one city to the next and the other people o n the bus are on the same tour as you are. They’re going on vacation and are going  to the same place as you’re going to. You can have a tour bus within a city tha t just gives you information about the most important places in the city – it ta kes you to those places. You could also have a tour bus that goes in between cit ies that travels around the country even.

Cesar is worried about missing the tour bus. He say s, “We’ll miss it if we don’t leave right now” – immediately. Matilda, who’s obvi ously a little slow, says, “I’m just getting some footage of this area before we le ave.” “Footage” (footage) is, in this case, a video recording. It used to be, of cou rse, that when you recorded things like a motion picture, you would have some t ape – physical tape – that would go around inside the machine and it would rec ord it on that – that is, the video would be recorded on this little piece of tap e that would go around inside. And if you took the tape and unwound it, you could actually measure how many feet the tape was. Probably that’s the origin of the word “footage” but nowadays, of course, we don’t have actual physical film, at l east in most cameras that a regular consumer or regular person would use. But w e still sometimes use this word “footage” to refer to an amount of video recor ding. I think it’s becoming less common nowadays.

Matilda says she’s getting some footage, she’s reco rding some video of this area, where they are right now, before they leave. She says, “This is area is known for its...” – she starts narrating the video,  she starts talking into the camera. Cesar says, “Now, what are you doing?” Mati lda says, “I’m doing a voice-over for this segment.” A “voice-over” is whe n you have a video and you hear someone’s voice who’s not actually in the vide o – at least you can’t see the person – so a voice over would be any kind of recor ding that you would hear while watching a video of something else. Matilda s ays she’s doing a voice-over for this segment. A “segment” (segment) is a sectio n or a part of a video, a film, a television show, a podcast, an audio show – any par t or section of that, a smaller part of it would be called the “segment.” So, Matil da is using all of this vocabulary that would probably be more likely used by a profes sional filmmaker. Matilda says voice-overs are very important in “good travel  videos.” “Travel videos” would be videos that show different popular tourist areas . It is something you would take when you go on a trip. If you go to Paris or y ou go to Bangkok or you go to

Tokyo, you could take videos of those areas and you  would show them to your friends or to other people to show them what you ca n see there – that’s a travel video.

Cesar says, “You can add the voice-over when you ed it it. Let’s go.” “To edit” (edit) means to change something, usually an audio,  or a video, to make it better, to get rid of the parts that you don’t want. We als o use this verb in talking about writing – you can edit someone’s writing. You can g o through and correct the grammar, change sentences around, correct the punct uation – all that might be part of editing. Cesar says, “You can add the voice -over – to the video – when you edit it. Let’s go.” Matilda says, “Just give me  five more minutes. Hmm, this footage is turning out to be too shaky.” The sound that she makes “hmm” is one you would make when you are maybe thinking of somet hing, maybe you saw something you didn’t like, or you were not certain about something – “hmm.” Usually it’s spelled “hmm”. Matilda says, “Hmm, thi s footage is turning out to be – is resulting – in something that is too shaky (shak y).” Something that is “shaky” has a lot of small movements. So, if you are taking  a video with a camera or your phone and you move it around a lot, when you watch it, it will look like you are moving the camera around and that would be “shaky” – it’s hard to watch.

Matilda says, “Hold on,” meaning wait, “while I set  up the tripod.” A tripod (tripod) is not related to a podcast. A “tripod” is a device  usually made out of metal that has three legs – that’s where you get the “tri-” (t ri) meaning three. The “tripod” is used to put a camera on so that the camera remains steady – that is to say, it doesn’t shake. So, you put a camera on a tripod and  you can use that for taking pictures. It could be a video camera. It could be a  regular camera that you would take photographs with – a “still” camera, I guess w e could call it. Cesar says, “We don’t have time for that. Grab your camcorder and l et’s go.” A “camcorder” (camcorder) is a camera that records video. It’s an other word for a video camera – a “camcorder,” coming from the words “camera” and  “recorder.”

Matilda says, “Too much motion will ruin any travel  video.” Cesar is trying to get Matilda on the tour bus so that they can leave but Matilda is spending her time talking about her video. She says, “Too much motion  (motion),” meaning too much movement, “will ruin any travel video.” “To ru in” (ruin) means to make something worthless, to destroy, to make it so that  you can’t use it anymore. Matilda is saying that if you have too much motion,  if you have too much movement, if it’s too shaky then the travel video w ill be ruined – you can’t use it, really. “Motion,’ I should mention, has a couple of  other meanings in English. Take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Matilda continues, “Wait. I want to get a close-up of that building and a wide- angle shot of this entire area.” A “close-up” (clos e-up) is an image of something where the camera is very close to it. It’s right ne xt to the object. It could be someone’s face or it could be a thing. Matilda want s a “close-up” of a building she sees and a “wide-angle (angle) shot” of this en tire area. A “wide-angle shot” is a photograph or a video that’s made with a speci al lens – a special thing you put on the front of the camera to show a very wide area so you’re able to see more than you could with a regular camera lens.

Matilda says, “Hey, where are you going with my gea r?” “Gear” (gear) here just means my equipment. Cesar says, “I and your gear ar e going to the tour bus.” So, Cesar is taking her camera and her things and w alking toward the tour bus. He says, “I’m not going to get left behind again.” “To be left behind” means not to be taken with the rest of the group of people – oft en because you’re too late or you’re too slow. If a bus is going to leave at 8 o’ clock and you come at 8:15, you will be “left behind” – you will have to stay where  you are because you missed the bus. And that’s what Cesar is trying to prevent .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  Hurry up! We’ll miss the tour bus if we don ’t leave right now.

Matilda:  I’m just getting some footage of this are a before we leave. “This area is known for its...”

Cesar:  Now what are you doing?

Matilda:  I’m doing a voice-over for this segment. Voice-overs are very important in good travel videos.

Cesar:  You can add the voice-over when you edit it . Let’s go!

Matilda:  Just give me five more minutes. Hmm, this  footage is turning out to be too shaky. Hold on while I set up the tripod.

Cesar:  We don’t have time for that. Grab your camc order, and let’s go.

Matilda:  Too much motion will ruin any travel vide o. Wait! I want to get a close- up of that building and a wide-angle shot of this e ntire area. Hey, where are you going with my gear?

 Cesar:  I, and your gear, are going to the tour bus . I’m not going to get left behind – again!

# Breaching Computer Security

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 834: Breaching Computer Security.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 834. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there today and take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your En glish faster than ever.

This dialogue is between Jim and Dina. It’s all abo ut computer security – making sure that your computer does not get information st olen from it. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Jin:  Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?

Dina:  No, what?

Jin:  Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer systems and cause a lot of problems over the weekend. They dest royed data and rendered the system unusable. In fact, the entire system cra shed.

Dina:  I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?

Jin:  Well, the company announced last week that it  had implemented new security measures, which made their systems impenet rable.

Dina:  Ah, that explains it. Making an announcement  like that is like issuing a challenge.

Jin:  Yeah, it was definitely a challenge. I bet a lot hackers were trying to breach those security measures, just to show that it could  be done. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and ex ploited them.

Dina:  What was McQ Corp thinking? They’ve had prob lems in the past with hackers and then they issue this challenge. I say t hat it serves them right!

Jin:  They shouldn’t have bragged about their new s ecurity measures, but those hackers caused a lot of damage.

 Dina:  I bet McQ Corp learned its lesson:  Don’t wa ve a red flag in front of a bull!

[end of dialogue]

Our topic on this episode is computer security. We begin with Jin saying, “Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?” “McQ Corp” is a company – a fictional company, not a real company. Dina says, “No, what?”  Jin says, “Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer sys tems.” A “hacker” (hacker) is a person who uses their computer skills to illegall y go into another website or to go into some computer software, often to steal some  secret or confidential information. The verb is “to hack” (hack). A “hacke r” is someone who hacks into a computer system. In this case, the computer system was at McQ Corp. And the hackers were able to get “unauthorized access.” “Un authorized” means not authorized. “Authorized” means you have permission – someone said, “Yes, that’s okay.” “Access” is the ability to reach some thing, to see something.

So, “unauthorized access” would be going into somew here where you don’t have permission to go. And the hackers did this with the  McQ Corp computer system and caused a lot of problems “over the weekend.” “O ver the weekend” means during this past Saturday and Sunday.

Jin says they “destroyed data and rendered the syst em unusable.” “Data” (data) means information, especially when we’re talking ab out computers or in scientific research, it’s the evidence that we use to examine our hypotheses or ideas. “Data” is technically a plural noun but it is often  used in the singular in more modern English. Jin says the hackers destroyed – th ey got rid of, they damaged – data, “rendered the system unusable.” “To render”  (render) means to put something in a particular position or to make somet hing present in a certain way. Basically, in this sentence it just means “make.” S o, they made – past tense – the system unusable. Once again, we see the prefix “un”  (un) – which means “not.” So, “unusable” means not usable, not able to be use d.

Jin says, “In fact, the entire system crashed.” “To  crash” (crash) – for a computer system or a network – means to suddenly stop workin g. If a computer crashes, it turns off, it stops working. You can’t do anything with it. This is a common problem for all computers at some time or another. Dina says, “I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?” Jin says, “Well, the company a nnounced last week, that it had implemented new security measures which made th eir systems impenetrable.” So, McQ Corp announced or told every one last week that it had implemented new security measures. “To implement” ( implement) means to begin, to officially launch or to formally start so mething. They started a new or put

into place a new security system – new security mea sures, our dialogue says. A “measure” (measure) is just a procedure or a proces s or an action. “Security” refers to keeping the computer system safe so peopl e don’t go in and steal things from it.

McQ Corp. implemented new security measures which m ade their systems “impenetrable.” We’re getting a lot of prefixes in this dialogue. One of them is “impenetrable.” The (im) is the same as (in) as a p refix and that once again, means not – just like (un). Sometimes we say (un), sometimes we say (in) – if it’s before a “p” the “n” becomes an “m” so it’s “impene trable” – not able to be penetrated is what that means. “To penetrate” means  to go into something. So, something is “impenetrable” – you’re not able to go  into it. Obviously, the hackers were able to penetrate the system and of course, th at caused all the problems.

Dina says, “Ah, that explains it. Making an announc ement like that is like issuing a challenge.” “To issue” (issue) here means to anno unce. It can also mean to give something to someone. You could say it also me ans that here too. A “challenge” is when you say to someone, “I want you  to do this,” or “I don’t think you could do this. This is a very difficult task. T his is a very difficult thing to do. I challenge you to do this!”

They’re using challenge as a verb. So, when McQ Cor p announced that it had new security measures, this was like issuing a chal lenge to the hackers. It was saying to the hackers, “See if you can break into o ur system. See if you can penetrate our security measures.” Jin says, “Yeah, it was definitely a challenge.” “I bet” – meaning I’m guessing – “a lot of hackers were trying to breach those security measures.” “To breach” (breach) means to b reak a rule or to go past some limit that you’re not supposed to go past. In this case, it means to get into the computer, to get around the security measures s o they can get into the computer.

Jin says, “They were trying to breach those securit y measures just to show that it could be done.” “Just to show” here means only to d emonstrate, only to let everyone know that the security measures were not a s good as the McQ Corp thought they were. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and exploited them. “One of them,” meaning one of the h ackers – found the system’s “vulnerabilities.” “Vulnerability” (vulnerability) is a weakness. If you are vulnerable, you are weak. There’s something about y ou that someone could beat you with or take advantage of you with. And the hac ker found the system’s vulnerabilities and “exploited them.” “To exploit” (exploit) means to use something to your advantage, which causes problems for someone else. It’s

good for you but it is hurting or harming someone e lse – that’s to exploit something or someone.

Dina says, “What was McQ Corp. thinking?” “What wer e they thinking?” means I can’t believe they were so stupid – that’s really w hat that question means. Dina says, “They’ve had problems in the past with hacker s and then they issue this challenge. I say, that it serves them right.” That’ s a common expression, “to serve (serve) someone right (right).” “To serve som eone right” means that the person got what they deserved. It’s used in a negat ive way when talking about the bad or negative results or consequences of some thing that someone has done. So, if you are driving fast down the freeway,  above the speed limit and the police catch you and give you a ticket – a fine – “ It serves you right,” I could say. You were doing something bad and now you have to fa ce or deal with the negative consequences.

Jin says, “They shouldn’t have bragged about their new security measures. But those hackers caused a lot of damage.” “To brag” (b rag) – means to tell everyone how good you are. “Oh, I’m the best tennis  player in Southern California.” “I’m the best singer in Hollywood.” Of  course, when you brag it’s not always true. Well, Jin says that McQ Corp. should n ot have bragged. They shouldn’t have said that their system was impenetra ble. Dina says, “I bet McQ Corp. learned its lesson.” “To learn its lesson” me ans they have learned from their mistake and they won’t do it again. Dina says , “The lesson is, don’t wave a red flag in front of a bull.” A “bull” (bull) is a large animal that traditionally, in countries like Spain and Mexico and a few other pla ces, is used in bull fighting, which is you fight against the bull. Not sure if th ey still do this in Spain. I know they still do it in Mexico, I believe.

“Bull fighting” is when you have a huge animal – th is huge bull – and a man gets in a circle with the bull, and basically tries to k ill the bull. The tradition is that if you have a red flag – a small piece of cloth, a sma ll piece of material – and you “wave it,” meaning you move it back and forth in fr ont of the bull, that this will cause the bull to get angry and to try to run at yo u. Now, I believe it’s also the case that bulls are actually colorblind so the colo r red doesn’t really have any special effect. But that’s the expression – to wave  a red flag in front of a bull. It means to make other people angry without any good r eason. You’re trying to make them angry and that’s what Dina says the McQ C orp. did with its computer system.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Jin:  Did you hear what happened to McQ Corp?

Dina:  No, what?

Jin:  Hackers were able to get unauthorized access to its computer systems and cause a lot of problems over the weekend. They dest royed data and rendered the system unusable. In fact, the entire system cra shed.

Dina:  I hadn’t heard that. Why McQ Corp?

Jin:  Well, the company announced last week that it  had implemented new security measures, which made their systems impenet rable.

Dina:  Ah, that explains it. Making an announcement  like that is like issuing a challenge.

Jin:  Yeah, it was definitely a challenge. I bet a lot hackers were trying to breach those security measures, just to show that it could  be done. One of them certainly found the system’s vulnerabilities and ex ploited them.

Dina:  What was McQ Corp thinking? They’ve had prob lems in the past with hackers and then they issue this challenge. I say t hat it serves them right!

Jin:  They shouldn’t have bragged about their new s ecurity measures, but those hackers caused a lot of damage.

Dina:  I bet McQ Corp learned its lesson:  Don’t wa ve a red flag in front of a bull!

# Getting Shocking News

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 835: Getting Shocking News.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 835. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Eslpod.com is our website. Go there, become a member, and improve your English faster than you ever thoug ht possible.

This episode is a dialogue between Karla and Chris about some surprising or shocking news. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Karla:  You look like you’ve had a shock.

Chris:  Yeah, that phone call threw me for a loop. My ex-girlfriend is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.

Karla:  Wow, that’s quite a bombshell. Are you goin g to do it?

Chris:  Of course. If the baby is biologically mine , I want to take responsibility for it. I wanted to start a family with my ex: get marr ied and have children – the whole shebang. So if the baby is mine, I’ll provide  child support, no question. I might even fight for custody.

Karla:  Really? That’s astounding. Most guys would be hoping that the baby isn’t theirs. What did your ex-girlfriend say when you to ld her?

Chris:  She thought I would be outraged or somethin g. Instead, she was the one who was left stunned.

Karla:  I’m surprised, too. Not many guys would wan t to have a child without being married.

Chris:  One part of me hopes the baby isn’t mine, o nly because my relationship with my ex-girlfriend is over and I don’t want to r ekindle it. But I’m not getting any younger and another part of me really wants to be a  father.

Karla:  Well, the DNA test will give you proof, one  way or the other. Just cross your fingers...

 Chris:  I would, but I’m not sure which outcome I w ant more!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Karla saying to Chris, “Yo u look like you’ve had a shock (shock).” A “shock” is a surprise – usually a negat ive surprise. A “shock” can also have other meanings in English. Take a look at the Learning Guide for some of those. Chris says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “That phone  call threw me for a loop.” The expression “to throw someone for a loop (loop)”  means to surprise someone, often with negative or confusing information. When my neighbor told me he was buying a new cat, I didn’t realize that he was buyi ng a lion, which of course is a large animal, not the kind of cat you would want to  have at home, if you’d want a cat in the first place.

Chris says the phone call threw him for a loop. He says, “My ex-girlfriend,” meaning my former or past girlfriend, “is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.” Chris says his ex-girlfriend is “p regnant” (pregnant). “To be pregnant” means that – for a woman only – you are g oing to have a baby, that there is a baby growing inside of you – that is to be pregnant. Most women are pregnant for about nine months before the baby is b orn, before it comes out of the woman’s body.

Chris’s ex-girlfriend is pregnant, showing Chris pe rhaps, not to have the best sense of judgment and responsibility. The ex-girlfr iend wants him to take a “paternity test.” A “paternity (paternity) test” co mes from the Latin word pater (pater) – meaning father. A “paternity test” is a t est to see whether you are the father of the baby. Once again, we get a little bit  more than what we need to know about the life of Chris and his ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend wants Chris to take this paternity test to see if he is the father  of the baby that the ex-girlfriend is now pregnant with – okay, kind of like a soap opera  today!

Karla says, “Wow, that’s quite a bombshell.” A “bom bshell” (bombshell) – one word – here means a very important or surprising pi ece of news – something that everyone would go, “Wow, I wasn’t expecting that!” Karla says this news is quite a “bombshell,” meaning it’s a very large bombshell.  It’s a very important one. “Are you going to do it?” Karla asks, meaning are you go ing to take this test? Chris says, “Of course. If the baby is biologically mine,  I want to take responsibility for it.” “Biologically” (biologically) refers to, in th is case, the real father, if you will, the actual father, the father that contributed his half  of the baby’s genetic code – that would be a baby that is biologically mine. You coul d also adopt a baby. Perhaps some woman or some couple is not able to take care of their baby, and so they

give it to another family. And the family “adopts” that baby – we would say that that baby is adopted but not biologically from the new parents.

Chris wants to see if the baby is biologically his – meaning it’s his. And if it is, he wants to take responsibility for it. “I wanted to s tart a family with my ex, get married, and have children, the whole shebang.” Chr is is saying that before he and his ex-girlfriend separated – before they broke  up – he wanted to have a family with her. “To get married and to have childr en, the whole shebang” – the expression “the whole (whole) shebang (shebang)” is  an informal phrase meaning everything – including everything. It’s a l ittle less common now than it was probably 20, 30 years ago, but you’ll still hea r it. “The whole shebang,” meaning everything – you could say this about a lot  of things. It could be for something as unimportant as your hamburger at McDon ald’s. You got to McDonald’s and you order a hamburger, and the perso n says, “Do you want everything on it? Do you want all the ingredients i n it?” and you say, “Yes, give me the whole shebang.” I’m getting kind of hungry t alking about hamburgers. It’s almost lunch time here in Los Angeles as I record t his so, hmm, maybe time to go and get myself a hamburger. Anyway, back to our dialogue.

Chris says, “If the baby is mine, I’ll provide chil d support, no question.” “Child support” is money that one parent – usually the fat her – pays to the other parent – usually the mother – when the two of them are sep arated, divorced, or were never married to begin with. Legally, fathers – bio logical fathers – maybe required in many places to provide child support to  the mother of the baby. It’s one of the unfortunate consequences of our modern s ociety that this has become necessary – to legally require fathers to support t heir children. But that’s where we are.

Chris says, “I might even fight for custody.” “Cust ody” (custody) is a legal right to have the child under the age of eighteen living wit h you. Normally, when a mother and a father get divorced and there are chil dren, it’s typical for the parents to have “joint-custody,” meaning the childr en spend some time with the mother and some time with the father. Sometimes, the woman is given “sole (sole) custody,” meaning basically, the father has very little right to see the children or to have the children come live with him . But it’s also possible for the father to get “sole custody.” So, “custody” is the right to have a child – usually your own child – living with you. And Chris says he  might “fight for custody,” meaning he’s going to try to have the baby live wit h him.

Karla is surprised. She says, “Really? That’s astou nding.” “Astounding” (astounding) – means very surprising, incredible. K arla says, “Most guys would be hoping that the baby isn’t theirs.” Most men wou ld hope the baby wasn’t theirs

so they wouldn’t have to support it. Karla says, “W hat did your ex-girlfriend say when you told her?” Chris says, “She thought I woul d be outraged or something.” “To be outraged” (outraged) means to be extremely a ngry, to be very mad. Chris says, “Instead, she was the one who was left stunne d.”

“To be stunned” (stunned) means to be very surprise d. Notice also the use of the verb “left.” “She was left stunned.” We would use t hat expression when you have told someone something and then you go away or you hang up the phone or you stop talking to them, and they remain there if you will, surprised. They’ve stayed surprised after that news. Karla says, “I’m surpris ed too. Not many guys” – here “guys” means men – “would want to have a child with out being married.” Chris says, “One part of me hopes the baby isn’t mine.” “ One part of me” means I have two different opinions. One opinion or one desire, really, is that the baby is not biologically mine. “Only because,” he says, “my rel ationship with my ex-grilfriend is over and I don’t want to rekindle it.” “To rekin dle” (rekindle) means to kindle again. And to kindle means to start. Usually, we us e that word in describing a fire. For some weird reason, there is a portable el ectronic reader called a “Kindle” sold by amazon.com that has to do with, of course, books. But in any case, “to rekindle” means to restart.

Chris says, “I’ not getting any younger and another  part of me really wants to be a father.” So, he has these two different desires. One is to be a father and therefore he hopes the baby is his, even though he’ s not married to the mother, which causes additional problems. But another part of him says, “I don’t want to be a father.” Of course, if he didn’t want to be a father, he probably should’ve thought about that a little earlier.

Karla says, “Well, the DNA test will give you proof , one way or the other.” A “DNA test” is a genetic test to determine, in this case,  whether Chris is the actual father of the baby. “Proof” (proof) is evidence that somet hing is true. The expression “One way or the other” means whichever result is co rrect. Here it means, more generally, there are only two possibilities, there are only two ways that this could happen, or two results. The two results are either he is the father or he isn’t. One way or the other, the DNA test will give him proof.  Karla says, “Just cross your fingers.” “To cross (cross) your fingers” means to hold one finger over the other like you are making and “X” – the letter “X”  – and  that is to wish for something. You want something to happen. You hope you get a jo b and your friend says, “Well, I’ll keep my fingers crossed,” meaning I wil l hope that you get the job. It’s sort of like good luck. Chris says, “I would,” mean ing I would cross my fingers, “but I’m not sure which outcome I want more.” An “o utcome” (outcome) – one word – is a result. So, Chris is not sure which res ult he wants.

Here’s an idea, Chris: how about the best result for the baby and not for you and your ex-girlfriend?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Karla:  You look like you’ve had a shock.

Chris:  Yeah, that phone call threw me for a loop. My ex-girlfriend is pregnant and she wants me to take a paternity test.

Karla:  Wow, that’s quite a bombshell. Are you goin g to do it?

Chris:  Of course. If the baby is biologically mine , I want to take responsibility for it. I wanted to start a family with my ex: get marr ied and have children – the whole shebang. So if the baby is mine, I’ll provide  child support, no question. I might even fight for custody.

# Working Shifts

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 836: Working Shifts.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 836. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at www.eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. Take a look at our ESL Podcast store while  you’re there.

This episode is a dialogue between Danny and Lisett e about different times that you work throughout the day. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Lisette:  You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t y ou?

Danny:  Yeah, it’s my first day.

Lisette:  I’m Lisette.

Danny:  I’m Danny. Nice to meet you.

Lisette:  You’re lucky to be starting on the day sh ift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to work the graveyard shif t for two years before I got the day shift.

Danny:  I guess I am lucky, but I wouldn’t mind wor king any shift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed. My wife and I are e xpecting our first child and we need to save up.

Lisette:  Oh, yeah? Congratulations! Well, there ar e always people who want time off and need someone to cover for them. You ca n usually pick up extra hours and shifts that way. Sometimes, there’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.

Danny:  I can understand that. Well, if you ever ne ed anybody to cover for you, just give me a shout.

Lisette:  All right, I’ll keep it in mind. Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.

[end of the dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Lisette saying to Danny,  “You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t you?” “The new kid on the block” (blo ck) here means a new person in an organization. Usually, in American cities, we  call the place where the houses or the apartments are in between the streets  “blocks.” “One block,” one rectangle that has four streets – one on the north,  one on the south, one on the east and one on the west – well, that’s a block. An d if you say you’re the “new kid on the block” that means usually your family has ju st moved to that particular area and the other kids may say, “You’re the new ki d here.” You’re the one that has arrived most recently.

Here we’re talking about a work organization, not a n actual city block. Danny says, “Yeah, it’s my first day.” Lisette says, “I’m  Lisette.” Danny says, “I’m Danny, nice to meet you.” Hmm, maybe we have something goi ng here between Lisette and Danny, let’s see. Lisette says, “You’re lucky t o be starting on the day shift.” A “shift” (shift) is the period of time during the 24 -hour day that you work. The “day shift” would be the period of time between, say, 8 or 9 in the morning and 4 or 5 in the afternoon – that would be in places that hav e workers there all 24 hours – in other words, a hospital, maybe certain factories  that make things that operate 24 hours a day. Well, you can’t work 24 hours a day  so you divide the day up into 3 shifts. The day shift, then there’s the second sh ift, which is usually from 4 or 5 in the afternoon until midnight or so, and then you  have what we’ll find out in a second is the “graveyard shift.”

Lisette says to Danny, “You’re lucky to be starting  on the day shift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to wo rk the graveyard shift for two years before I got the day shift.” “Umpteen” (umpte en) is an unusual word in English but you will hear it in conversation. It me ans a lot or many. The idea is that there are so many years you can’t count them. Often, it’s an expression or a word used by people who are getting older and can’t  remember or don’t want to remember how many years ago it was. I graduated fro m high school “umpteen” years ago – many, many, many, many, many years ago.  Lisette says she started working at this company umpteen years ago – many ye ars ago – and when she did, she had to work the “graveyard” shift. A “grav eyard” – one word - is a place where you bury bodies. It’s a place where you put d ead people - a “cemetery,” we could also call it. But in the expression “grave yard shift” – it refers to people who have to work from midnight to say, 8 or 9 o’clo ck in the morning – the people who have to work at night, after usually midnight o r 1 AM – we call this the

“graveyard shift.” Why? Well, I guess because peopl e have this idea that the dead are fans of the nighttime, that bodies walk du ring the night – I don’t know, that’s just what we call it.

Danny says, “I guess I am lucky. But I wouldn’t min d working any shift even double shifts.” “To work a double shift” means to w ork 16 hours – to work 2 shifts. The day shift and the second shift – the first shif t and the second shift, for example. Danny says, “I wouldn’t mind working any s hift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed.” “To get up to speed” means  to learn something quickly – once you’re able to do what you are supposed to do.  So, you’re learning some new skills, some new thing you have to do at your w ork. It may take you a day, a week, a month to really be able to do it as well as  you should, as well as everyone else. You need to get up to speed – to be moving fast enough, if you will.

“My wife and I are expecting our first child,” Dann y says – so, I guess there’s no relationship between Danny and Lisette – “and we ne ed to save up.” “To save up” is a phrasal verb that means to save money, usu ally for some particular purpose. “I’m saving up for a car.” “I’m saving up for a new computer.” “I’m saving up for a new electric guitar so I can be in a rock band” – yeah, that will be cool. “So, I’m saving up for something.”

And Danny and his wife, who is expecting her first child – when we say “they’re expecting” we mean she is going to have the baby, s he’s pregnant – Danny needs to save up. Lisette says, “Oh, yeah? Congratu lations!” Now, of course, Lisette must be a little disappointed to find out t hat Danny is already married but she doesn’t seem to indicate that in the dialogue. Lisette says, “Congratulations! Well, there are always people who want time off and  need someone to cover for them.” “Time off” are hours or days when you don’t work your normal schedule. So, normally you work Monday through Friday, but yo u’re going to take some time off. We use the verb “to take” – with time off . You’re going to take some time off on Friday or on Monday. You’re not going to wor k all or part of that day. Lisette says that “there are always people,” meanin g there will always be someone who wants to take time off and need someone  to “cover for them.” “To cover (cover) for someone” means to work when anoth er person cannot. So, someone says, “I can’t work this afternoon” – altho ugh I am scheduled, I’m supposed to – “Could you cover for me?” “Could you work during the time that I’m supposed to work?”

Lisette says, ”You can usually pick up extra hours and the shifts that way.” “To pick up” here is a phrasal verb meaning to get some thing in addition to what you

would normally have. Normally you work 8 hours but you can pick up an extra four hours by working half a shift, four hours of t he second shift, for someone who wants time off. “Sometimes,” Lisette says, “the re’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.” “Overtime” (overti me) – one word – is when you work at a job where you are paid by the hour and yo u work more than your normal number of hours for that week – usually in t he U.S it’s forty hours. So, if you get paid by the hour, you make $20 an hour or $ 40 an hour or whatever it is, and you work your 40 hours and then the boss wants you to work “overtime” – you’re working more than your regular 40 hours. And  in the U.S and most places, you get paid extra. So, you might get paid, instead  of your normal $20 an hour, you might get paid $25 or $30. Sometimes, companies  will pay what’s called “double time.” They’ll pay you twice as much as you  normally work if you work overtime – more than your normal 40 hours. This is only for people who are paid by the hour. If you get a “salary” – if you are pai d a certain amount every year, then typically, you don’t get overtime. You may wor k 60 -70 hours a week but you are not going to get paid extra. But overtime is wh en you are paid extra for an hourly position.

Lisette says that the veteran workers – the workers  who have a lot of experience – who have been here a long time. “The veteran work ers get first dibs.” “To get first dibs” means that you are the first person or in the group that gets to decide or choose something before anyone else. So, if the company says, “We’re going to offer 10 hours overtime this week,” first they w ill ask the veteran employees – the employees who have been there a long time. “Do you want it?” And they say “No.” And then they go to the next group and then t he next group. “To get first dibs” means to get first choice. It’s an expression  that we use sometimes. It’s often something that you would say as a child. Let’ s say there’s a piece of chocolate cake or a large chocolate cake with sever al pieces and somebody says, “I get first dibs,” meaning I get to choose m y piece before the rest of you. But adults can also say this.

Danny says, “I can understand that. Well, if you ev er need anyone to cover for you,” he says to Lisette, “Just give me a shout.” T he expression “to give someone a shout” (shout) means to call someone or t o contact them. Usually it means to call them on the telephone. It’s an inform al expression. You wouldn’t use it in a formal setting, but among friends or co -workers – people you work with – it’s okay. It’s probably an expression that would  become less common. Now, instead of giving someone a shout, you would probab ly send them a text. Informally, we might use the verb “shoot” – “to sho ot someone a text or an email,” “send me an email” or “shoot me an email” –  that would mean the same thing – contact me.

Lisette says, “Alright, okay. I’ll keep it in mind”  – I’ll remember that. “Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.” She’s helpin g Danny by giving him extra hours so he can save up for “diapers” (diapers). “D iapers” are things that you put around a baby – around their bottom – so that they can go to the bathroom because, of course, babies can’t walk and go to the  bathroom by themselves. I don’t have a lot of experience changing diapers. I was the youngest in my family. I know my older brothers and sisters do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lisette:  You’re the new kid on the block, aren’t y ou?

Danny:  Yeah, it’s my first day.

Lisette:  I’m Lisette.

Danny:  I’m Danny. Nice to meet you.

Lisette:  You’re lucky to be starting on the day sh ift. When I started working here umpteen years ago, I had to work the graveyard shif t for two years before I got the day shift.

Danny:  I guess I am lucky, but I wouldn’t mind wor king any shift, even double shifts, once I get up to speed. My wife and I are e xpecting our first child and we need to save up.

Lisette:  Oh, yeah? Congratulations! Well, there ar e always people who want time off and need someone to cover for them. You ca n usually pick up extra hours and shifts that way. Sometimes, there’s even overtime, but the veteran workers get first dibs.

Danny:  I can understand that. Well, if you ever ne ed anybody to cover for you, just give me a shout.

Lisette:  All right, I’ll keep it in mind. Maybe I can help you save up for a diaper or two.

# Driving While Calling and Texting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 837: Driving While Calling and Texting.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 837. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Pamela and Josh who are calling and texting and doing all sorts of things when they shouldn’t b e doing them. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pamela:  [laughs] Did you see this tweet from Sarah ? She’s so funny.

Josh:  Hold on. I’m texting Lance. I want to make s ure he knows where we’re meeting up.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Oh, hi Lance. Did  you get Josh’s text? You didn’t? Let me IM you, bye.

Josh:  I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text. I sen t it from the same number I normally use.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Jessica! Where ha ve you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days. I thought you’d fallen  off the face of the earth. What? You’ve been on vacation with your parents and you’v e been incommunicado, with no web access and no phone signal? That’s mind -blowing!

Josh:  Ask Jessica whether she  got my text. I’m really starting to worry about my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us ri ght now. Say “cheese.”

Pamela:  Cheese. [brakes squealing] What was that?

Josh:  It’s just a reckless driver. Just change lan es.

Pamela:  You change lanes. You’re the one driving.

 Josh:  No, I’m not. How can I be driving when I’m s o busy texting?

[end of dialogue]

Pamela and Josh are talking. Pamela says, “Did you see this tweet from Sarah. She’s so funny.” A “tweet” (tweet) is a message of a hundred and forty characters – sort of like a hundred and forty letters and spac es – that is sent through a service called “Twitter” (twitter) – which many of you are probably familiar with. I’ve been on twitter since, oh, 2006, maybe 2007 – eslpod, of course, is where you can find us on Twitter. Pamela is talking about  a tweet – a message that she got from a friend of hers, we assume, Sarah, Josh s ays, “Hold on” – wait a minute – “I’m texting Lance.” “To text” (text) is t o send a short text message on your telephone, on your cellular telephone – your m obile phone – to someone else. Josh says, “I want to make sure he” – his fri end lance – “knows where we’re meeting up.” “To meet up” is a phrasal verb that ra lly just means to meet someone. But “meet up” – with a (up) at the end – i s a little more informal. Usually, it means we’re going to go and we don’t ha ve any particular plans. It’s not a business meeting. It’s more of an informal – social meeting – you might say.

Pamela answers her cell phone and says, “Hello? Oh,  hi Lance. Did you get Josh’s text?” – Did you receive the text that Josh just sent you – “You didn’t?” “Let me IM you. Bye.” “IM” or as a verb – “to IM” m eans to send someone an instant message. “IM” stands for instant message or  instant messaging. A lot of online programs allow you to send IM’s and they get  to the other person immediately. Josh says, “I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text? I sent it from the same number I normally use.” “The same number” here  means the same phone number and in some ways, Josh is saying, from the s ame phone or the same phone account. “Number” has a lot of different mean ings in English however. Take a look at our Leaning Guide for some more of t hose.

Pamela’s cell phone rings again and she says, “Hell o. Jessica. Where have you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days.” – I’v e been sending you emails – electronic messages you send through your computer,  of course. Pamela says, “I thought you’d fallen off the face of the earth.” Th is is an old expression – “to fall of the face of the earth” – means to disappear for a period of time without telling anyone where you’re going, without communicating wi th your family or your friends. “She fell off the face of the earth” – she  just disappeared. No one knows where she is. Pamela says to Jessica that she thoug ht Jessica had fallen off the face of the earth. Of course, we don’t hear what Je ssica is saying. We just hear what Pamela is saying on the phone. She says, “What ? You’ve been on vacation

with your parents and you’ve been incommunicado? Wi th no web access and no phone signal?” The term “incommunicado” (incommunic ado) means that you are not able to communicate with other people – that yo u are not able to be in contact with other people. You don’t have a phone o r in this case, in Jessica’s case, she didn’t have any “web access.” “Web” here means Internet. She didn’t have any ability to connect to the Internet – to ge t on an Internet connection. She had no web access and “no phone signal,” meaning wh erever she was, there was no cellular or mobile phone signal – no ability  to use your phone because there simply isn’t any equipment from a telephone –  a mobile telephone company that you can communicate with.

Pamela says, “That’s mind-blowing!” “Mind-blowing” (blowing) is something that is very surprising – something that is very hard to  believe. Something that’s almost extraordinary.” It’s almost impossible – tha t’s mind-blowing,” or “That was a mind-blowing movie.” We can also use this as a ve rb – “to blow someone’s mind,” or “That really blew my mind.” “Blew” (blew)  is the past tense of blow. It’s irregular. “It blew my mind” – it was something tha t surprised me or shocked me – something I wasn’t expecting. Josh then says to P amela, “Ask Jessica whether she got my text. I’m really starting to worry about  my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us right now. Say ‘cheese!’” “Better  yet” is an expression that means even better. We use it to emphasize that what  we are going to say next is even a better idea than the idea we just told you. So, for example, I may say, “Let’s go to the movies. Better yet, let’s go to Ho llywood and make a movie or be in a movie.” You see, the second idea is better tha n the first. Why just go to a movie when you can come here to Hollywood, in Los A ngeles and make a movie, right? Well, that’s the general idea of “better yet .”

Josh says that he’s starting to worry about his acc ount. He’s not sure if his text messages are being sent out properly from his phone  number, from his phone account. So, he suggests sending Jessica a photo of  Josh and Pamela. And so, he takes a photo – a photograph, a picture – of him self and Jessica. And when you take a photograph in English, of someone else a nd you want them to smile, we use the word “cheese.” So, “Say cheese!” Because  when you say the word “cheese” (cheese) – a type of food – you have to op en your mouth and you can see your teeth when you say that word. Pamela says,  “Cheese!” And then we hear the brakes squealing. “To squeal” (squeal) is a very high-pitched sound. You heard the sound in the dialogue. “Squeal” is a verb we would use to describe noise that is being made by tires of a car or autom obile when you suddenly have to stop. The tires are, of course, the four circula r pieces of rubber on each corner of the car that go on the wheels. When you have to stop suddenly, your tires may squeal or if you leave suddenly. You suddenly try t o go fast when you are not

moving – you go fast quickly – that could cause you r tires to squeal – to make a noise. Basically, it’s the noise made by a wheel ag ainst the street.

Pamela says, “What was that?” Josh says, “It’s just  a reckless driver.” Now, of course, we hadn’t really realized in the dialogue u ntil now that Pamela and Josh are driving while they’re doing all this tweeting a nd texting and IM-ing and phone calling and taking photos. A “reckless (reckless) p erson” is someone who’s not careful, who’s not cautious – who’s doing something  dangerous. And, of course, the joke here is that Josh and Pamela are doing som ething very dangerous, or at least Josh is, if he’s driving. And he’s saying tha t the other driver was being reckless. Josh says, “Just change lanes.” So, just is telling Pamela to move to a different part of the road. A “lane” is a section o f a road. Here in Los Angeles, we have freeways, highways that have three, four, five  lanes on each side. So, there are five places that a car can go in a certain dire ction. Pamela is being told by Josh to “change lanes” – to go from one lane to ano ther – one section of the road to another.

Well, of course, we thought that Josh was driving a nd that’s what Pamela says, “You change lanes, you’re the one driving.” Josh sa ys, “No I’m not. How can I be driving when I’m so busy texting?” Josh saying he c an’t be the one driving because he’s texting. Of course, the joke here, whi ch is not such a joke, is that it can be very dangerous to be doing all these things while you’re driving. And here in the United States, especially here in California , it is now illegal to be texting and driving at the same time. The amazing thing is you actually have to tell people not to do that. People are so stupid, they d on’t realize that you shouldn’t be texting and driving at the same time but people are stupid everywhere and apparently, especially here in California.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pamela:  [laughs] Did you see this tweet from Sarah ? She’s so funny.

Josh:  Hold on. I’m texting Lance. I want to make s ure he knows where we’re meeting up.

Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Oh, hi Lance. Did  you get Josh’s text? You didn’t? Let me IM you, bye.

Josh:  I wonder why Lance didn’t get my text. I sen t it from the same number I normally use.

 Pamela: [cell phone rings] Hello. Jessica! Where ha ve you been? I’ve been emailing you for three days. I thought you’d fallen  off the face of the earth. What? You’ve been on vacation with your parents and you’v e been incommunicado, with no web access and no phone signal? That’s mind -blowing!

Josh:  Ask Jessica whether she  got my text. I’m really starting to worry about my account. Better yet, I’ll text her a photo of us ri ght now. Say “cheese.”

# Talking About Immigration

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 838: Talking About Immigration.

This episode is a dialog between Ann and Chris, abo ut a popular issue in the United States – immigration. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Ann:  The immigration policy in this country is rid iculous. Why are there so many illegal immigrants here? They cross the border and take American jobs! They all need to be deported.

Chris:  A lot of immigrants have lived here nearly all their lives. Do you mean to tell me that you want to do some of the jobs that u ndocumented workers do, like picking crops and cleaning houses, and not earning minimum wage?

Ann:  There’s nothing wrong with that kind of work.  I wouldn’t want to do it myself...

Chris:  That’s just it! You’re willing to benefit f rom cheap labor, but you keep complaining about immigrants. There needs to be an amnesty or work permit program so that they can stay legally and work.

Ann:  And pay their taxes! These illegal immigrants  dodge paying taxes, too.

Chris:  But they don’t get the same social services  that citizens or legal immigrants do. You can’t have it both ways. If you want them to do what citizens are required to do, then you have to give them lega l status. And, by the way, when is your visitor’s visa up?

Ann:  It was up last month, but I’m from Canada! Ov erstaying a visa is not the same thing as being an illegal alien.

Chris:  That’s where you’re wrong. Where’s that num ber for immigration?

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Ann saying to Chris, “The im migration policy in this country is ridiculous.” “Immigration” (immigration)  is when people come into a country. They leave their own country and they go t o a different country and typically become citizens of that country, become m embers of that country or that nation, if you will. Ann says the immigration polic y – the laws, the rules, the guidelines for immigration in this country – is “ri diculous,” meaning it’s terrible. “Ridiculous” usually has a negative meaning, especi ally in an example like this.

Ann says, “Why are there so many illegal immigrants  here?” “Illegal” (illegal) is something that is against the law. “Immigrant” is t he person who immigrates. So, if you leave from one country to another, you are a n immigrant to your new country. The United States, of course, is for the m ost part a country of immigrants. Ann says that these illegal immigrants “cross the border and take American jobs.” A “border” (border) is the line tha t divides, in this case, two countries. “To cross” means to go from one side to the other. So, “to cross the border” means to go from one country to another. An n is talking about these illegal immigrants who are coming from another coun try and into the United States – they’re crossing the border. They all need  to be “deported,” Ann says.

“To deport” (deport) is when the government of a co untry makes you leave that country. They kick you out of the country. They req uire that you leave. Chris responds that a lot of immigrants have “lived here nearly all their lives,” meaning many immigrants have been here since they were chil dren. “Do you mean to tell me that you want to do some of the jobs that undocu mented workers do?” The phrase, “Do you mean to tell me…” is used when you can’t really believe what the other person is telling you. “Do you mean to te ll me that you have never visited New York City?” Well, a lot of people have not New York City, but if you didn’t believe what the person was telling you, if you were surprised and perhaps even a little angry, you might use this phrase. “Do  you mean to tell me that you want to do some of the jobs that undocumented worke rs do?” What Chris is saying that the jobs that are being taken by illega l immigrants are jobs that most people probably don’t want to do themselves – most Americans.

The term “undocumented worker” refers to, basically , an illegal immigrant. But it’s a little nicer term. “Undocumented” means you don’t  have legal documents, and a worker, of course, is someone who works. Chris me ntions a couple of these jobs such as “picking crops” (crops). “Crops” refer s to food that is grown, food that you eat – plants. “To pick” means to go out an d take the food from the plant so that you can eat it, such as corn, for example. “Cleaning houses” means, of course, making sure that a house is clean by cleani ng the floors and the windows

and so forth. This is a job that many undocumented workers do. They work as what we would call “maids” (maids), a person who yo u pay to clean your house.

Chris says these undocumented workers often don’t e arn or don’t receive the “minimum wage.” In the United States, the “minimum wage” (wage) is the minimum amount of money you can pay a worker each h our. I’m not sure exactly what it is in 2012. It can also be different in dif ferent states. Some states have a higher minimum wage than the national or federal mi nimum wage. I believe in the year we are recording this – 2012 – it’s a little m ore than $7 an hour.

Ann says, “There’s nothing wrong with that kind of work. I wouldn’t want to do it myself…” meaning I don’t want to do that kind of wo rk. Chris says, “That’s just it.” “That’s just it” here means “That’s my point, that’ s what I’m trying to say.” You’re saying what I’m saying. “You’re willing to benefit from cheap labor but you keep complaining about immigrants.” “Labor” (labor) here  means the work that is performed by people, not machines or computers. The  word “labor” can also be used to describe what happens when a woman is about  to give birth to a child. When a child is about to be born, we say that the m other goes “into labor.” That, as many of you probably know from personal experien ce, is a lot of work indeed.

Chris says, “There needs to be an amnesty or work p ermit program so that they” – the undocumented workers – “can stay legally and work.” “Amnesty” (amnesty) is when the government decides they’re not going to  punish you for doing something illegal. Usually, amnesty is given for a short period of time and typically, for things that are not that serious. for example, the public library system might have a week where you can return a boo k even if it is “overdue” – even though you were supposed to return it a long t ime ago and have to pay money because it’s late. If a library gives you amn esty, it’s saying, “We’re not going to punish you. You don’t have to pay anything  if you return the book.” Well, here, Chris is talking about amnesty for illegal im migrants, for undocumented workers. The government would not punish them if th ey wanted to stay in the country.

A “work permit” (permit) is an official document – an official letter or card – that allows you to work in a country. It’s the permissio n that the government gives you to work in that country. In the United States, you have to have a “work permit” or some sort of permission from the government to work  here, if you’re not an official resident or citizen of the U.S. Ann says, “And pay their taxes.” She’s saying that these illegal immigrants need to pay th eir taxes. She says, “They dodge paying taxes, too.” “To dodge” (dodge) means to avoid, to find a way not to do something. Some people try to “dodge” their t axes. They invent or create ways that will help them avoid having to pay the go vernment money – that’s what

Ann says these workers are doing. Chris says, “But they don’t get the same social services that citizens or legal immigrants d o.” “Social services” refers to benefits, programs provided by the government, to h elp people who are poor to give them healthcare, to help people who perhaps ha ve a drug problem – all of these could be called “social services,” helping pe ople who need help, especially economic help, financial help, help with money.

“Citizens” (citizens) are people who are members of  – or part of – a particular country, who have the rights and responsibilities o f being in that country. I am a citizen of the United States. If you are born in the United States, you also become a citizen of the United States, even when yo ur parents are from a different country. Chris says, “You can’t have it b oth ways,” meaning you can’t say one thing and then something that is opposite, and believe that both of those things should happen or are true. He says, “If you want them” – the undocumented workers – “to do what citizens are req uired to do, then you have to give them legal status.” You have to say, “Oh, i t’s okay. You can stay here. You can stay in this country.” “And, by the way,” –  in addition – “when is your visitor’s visa up?” A “visa” (visa) is a document t hat allows you to visit a certain place, usually for a short amount of time, although  sometimes the visa can be for a longer period of time. If you come to the United States as a student, and you’re studying at a U.S university, you would get a “stud ent visa.” You could stay here, perhaps four, maybe six, even 8 years, depending on  how much education you get.

Chris is asking Ann about her visitor’s visa, which  means she’s not even an American citizen. She herself is from some other co untry. Ann says, “It was up last month.” “It was up” means that it expired, it was no longer valid. “But I’m from Canada,” she says. “Overstaying a visa is not the s ame thing as being an illegal alien.” “To overstay” (overstay) – one word – means  to stay somewhere for more time than you are supposed to or for more time than  you are expected to be there. We have an expression, “He’s overstaying his  welcome,” meaning he’s staying too long at someone’s house or in someone’s  apartment. Now this person who owns the apartment or house is starting to get a little upset. They’ve been staying there too long. “To overstay a visa” w ould mean to get a visa to visit a country and then stay there longer than the visa allows you to. Ann says, “That’s not the same thing as being an illegal alie n” – an illegal immigrant. The word “alien” (alien) here means a person who is not  from this country. We also use that word “alien” to describe beings from outer  space – creatures or life forms from other planets, if they exist.

Chris says, “That’s where you’re wrong.” He’s sayin g Ann is wrong. Overstaying a visa is, in fact, becoming an illegal immigrant. “Where’s that number for

immigration?” “Where’s that number for the office o f immigration,” or the agency in the United States government that takes care of people who are immigrants.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Ann:  The immigration policy in this country is rid iculous. Why are there so many illegal immigrants here? They cross the border and take American jobs! They all need to be deported.

Chris:  A lot of immigrants have lived here nearly all their lives. Do you mean to tell me that you want to do some of the jobs that u ndocumented workers do, like picking crops and cleaning houses, and not earning minimum wage?

Ann:  There’s nothing wrong with that kind of work.  I wouldn’t want to do it myself...

Chris:  That’s just it! You’re willing to benefit f rom cheap labor, but you keep complaining about immigrants. There needs to be an amnesty or work permit program so that they can stay legally and work.

# Getting a Divorce

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 839: Getting a Divorce.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 839. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Our website is e slpod.com. Go there, become a member, download the Learning Guide for this epis ode. Also take a look at our ESL Podcast store on the same website.

This episode is a dialog between Tom and Nicole abo ut getting a divorce. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Nicole:  I’m really sorry to hear about you and Cat herine getting a divorce.

Tom:  I appreciate it, but it was a long time comin g. We’ve been heading toward divorce for years. I just hope it doesn’t get too m essy.

Nicole:  I don’t mean to pry, but didn’t the two of  you have a prenup?

Tom:  Yeah, but Catherine wants it set aside becaus e our financial situation has changed so much since we got married. She also want s sole custody of Sarah, alimony, and child support.

Nicole:  We live in a community property state, so that should simplify things, shouldn’t it?

Tom:  You’d think so, but the distribution of prope rty may get complicated. I’m hoping we can settle everything amicably, but I’m r eady for a fight, if it turns ugly. I’ve hired Dewey Cheatum.

Nicole:  Wow, you’re serious. He’s the most high-po wered divorce attorney in this city.

Tom:  I’m not taking any chances with my assets or my daughter. If Catherine wants to play hardball, I’m coming out swinging!

[end of dialog]

Our happy dialog begins with Nicole saying to Tom, “I’m really sorry to hear about you and Catherine getting a divorce.” “I’m so rry to hear about” is an expression that we use when we hear some bad news, and we are telling the other person that we understand, and we feel sorry for them. Nicole says she’s sorry to hear about Tom and Catherine getting a div orce. A “divorce” (divorce) is an official or legal end to a marriage between two people. Tom says, “I appreciate it” – I appreciate you telling me that y ou feel sorry – “but it was a long time coming.” The expression “a long time coming” m eans that it had been expected for a long time. It was not a surprise. We  knew it was going to happen.

Tom says, “We’ve been heading” – Catherine, maybe w e should call her “Katie”? – Catherine and Tom “have been heading toward divor ce for years.” “To be heading toward” means you are moving in that direct ion. He says, “I just hope it doesn’t get too messy.” “Messy” (messy) here means difficult, complicated, not nice, not kind. “Messy” can also be when something is dirty or disorganized. You could have a “messy” desk. I could have a messy des k. (Actually, I have  a messy desk!)

Nicole says, “I don’t mean to pry, but didn’t the t wo of you have a prenup?” “To pry” (pry) means to try to find out the details of someone else’s life, to try to find out the secret things that are going on with someon e else, things they may not want to tell you about – personal things, private t hings. Nicole says, “I don’t mean to pry” – my intention is not to pry – “but didn’t the two of you have a prenup?” A “prenup” (prenup) is short for a “prenuptial (prenu ptial) agreement.” That’s a legal agreement that is made between a husband and a wife  before they get married that decides usually how they are going to have the ir money divided in case they get divorced. So, a “prenuptial agreement” – “nupti al” refers to marriage – is an agreement that is used often by people who have a l ot of money and who are afraid of losing their money if they get divorced. Tom says, “Yeah,” – yes – “we have a prenup, but Catherine wants it set aside bec ause our financial situation has changed so much since we got married.” “To set aside” (aside) means to decide not to use something or to decide not to con sider something. Sometimes it can mean simply to save something for later. But  when we talk about a legal agreement, it means to not consider it, to act as t hough it didn’t exist, to ignore it.

Tom says, “She also wants sole custody of Sarah, al imony, and child support.” “Sole” (sole) means just one or just one person. “C ustody” (custody) is the legal right to take care of a child. “To have sole custod y” would mean that only one of the parents, either the father or the mother – usua lly the mother – has the legal right to take care of the child, to have the child to live with them. When a man and a woman get divorced, often when there are chil dren, there are

disagreements about who should take care of the chi ldren. There are disagreements about custody.

Catherine wants sole custody of their daughter, ali mony, and child support. “Alimony” (alimony) is money that one spouse, eithe r the husband or the wife, gives to the other spouse because the other person doesn’t have enough money to live on. Traditionally, it has been money the ma n would give to the woman – the husband would give to the wife so that she coul d take care of herself, have a place for the child or the children to live, and so  forth. Nowadays, it’s not necessarily the case that when you get a divorce, t he man will give the woman alimony. It could be the woman giving the man alimo ny.

“Child support” is when you are legally required to  give money to the other parent in order to help pay for the expenses of the child,  to feed the child, to send him to school and so forth. Nicole says, “We live in a com munity property state so that should simplify things, shouldn’t it?” A “community  property state” is a state where the law is when a man and a woman get married  – when two people get married – your property is divided 50-50 if you get  divorced, at least the property that you had received or had acquired – had gotten while you were married. All of the money, all of the property, the houses, the car s – all of that is divided 50-50. The husband gets 50%, the wife gets 50% - that’s a community property state. California is a community property state.

Tom says, “You’d think so” – you would think it wou ld simplify or make things easier – “but the distribution of property may get complicated.” “Property” refers to money and things that you own. “Distribution” re fers to who gets what. I get the car, you get the house, I get the jewelry, you get the lawn mower and so forth – that’s distribution of property. Tom says, “I’m hop ing we can settle everything amicably.” “To settle” here means to take care of. “Amicably” (amicably) means in a friendly, nice, pleasant way. Tom says, “But I ’m ready for a fight if it turns ugly.” “To turn ugly” means to become very difficul t, to become very unpleasant – perhaps even dangerous.

Tom says, “I’ve hired Dewey Cheatum.” “I’ve hired” means I have employed, I have give a job to Dewey Cheatum, who we find out, is a lawyer, an attorney. (He works for the law firm, the law company, of Dew ey, Cheatum, and Howe.) Nicole says, “Wow, you’re serious. He’s the most hi gh-powered divorce attorney in this city.” “High-powered” means very influentia l, very powerful. An “attorney,” is of course, a lawyer, someone who helps you with legal matters – contracts, crimes and so forth. “Divorce,” we’ve already talke d about, is when you legally separate and end a marriage. So, a high-powered div orce attorney would be a lawyer who is very powerful, very influential who d eals with divorces.

 Tom says, “I’m not taking any chances.” “To take a chance” would be to risk. Tom says, “I’m not taking any chances with my asset s or my daughter.” Your “assets” (assets) are things that are worth money –  a house, a piece of land, jewelry, investments and so forth. Tom says, “If Ca therine wants to play hardball, I’m coming out swinging.” The expression “to play h ardball” (hardball) means to do everything necessary to get what you want, espec ially when you are arguing or fighting with another person. You don’t care if the other person gets hurt. You’re going to be very tough. You’re going to be w hat we might call “ruthless” (ruthless). Tom says, if Catherine plays hard ball,  he’s “coming out swinging.” The expression “to come out swinging” (swinging) me ans to be ready to fight, to defend yourself, to argue for what you believe in, in a very strong and forceful way.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Nicole:  I’m really sorry to hear about you and Cat herine getting a divorce.

Tom:  I appreciate it, but it was a long time comin g. We’ve been heading toward divorce for years. I just hope it doesn’t get too m essy.

Nicole:  I don’t mean to pry, but didn’t the two of  you have a prenup?

Tom:  Yeah, but Catherine wants it set aside becaus e our financial situation has changed so much since we got married. She also want s sole custody of Sarah, alimony, and child support.

Nicole:  We live in a community property state, so that should simplify things, shouldn’t it?

Tom:  You’d think so, but the distribution of prope rty may get complicated. I’m hoping we can settle everything amicably, but I’m r eady for a fight, if it turns ugly. I’ve hired Dewey Cheatum.

Nicole:  Wow, you’re serious. He’s the most high-po wered divorce attorney in this city.

Tom:  I’m not taking any chances with my assets or my daughter. If Catherine wants to play hardball, I’m coming out swinging!

# Translating a Document

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 840: Translating a Document.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 840. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Our website is e slpod.com. Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog between Francine and Aziz about taking some documents, something that has been written, and tra nslating it into another language. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Francine:  Do you know the word in Mcquish for “par tnership”?

Aziz:  No, I don’t speak Mcquish. What are you doin g?

Francine:  Jim gave me this letter and this documen t to translate into Mcquish because I speak a little of it, but even with a dic tionary and thesaurus, it’s slow going.

Aziz:  Didn’t you tell Jim that?

Francine:  I did, but he still wants me to try beca use it’s so hard to find a Mcquish-English bilingual.

Aziz:  I’m not surprised. Other than you, I don’t k now anyone who speaks Mcquish.

Francine:  Yeah, well, I’m doing my best to transla te these documents idiomatically because the literal translation won’t  make any sense, but it’s a tough job. I simply don’t know enough business Mcquish to  know the equivalent words and phrases.

Aziz:  Can’t you just paraphrase and convey the gen eral meaning by using a lot of loan words and cognates?

Francine:  I’m trying, but I don’t think it’s turni ng out the way it’s supposed to.

Aziz:  At least he didn’t ask you to interpret. You ’d really be in the hot seat trying to interpret in a meeting or over the phone.

Francine:  Yeah, at least I was spared that experie nce, at least for now.

Aziz:  I wish I could help you, but the only langua ge I speak, other than English, is gibberish!

[end of dialog]

Francine begins by saying to Aziz, “Do you know the  word in McQuish for partnership?” “McQuish” is a very rare language. It ’s not spoken by more than, oh maybe a hundred people or so. You probably have never heard of it. Francine wants to know the word in McQuish for “partnership”  (partnership). A “partnership” is usually when two people decide to work together in a business, for example.

Aziz says, “No, I don’t speak McQuish. What are you  doing?” Francine says, “Jim gave me this letter and this document to translate into McQuish because I speak a little of it but even with a dictionary and a the saurus, it’s slow going. “ “To translate” means to take the words in one language and express them in another. What we’re trying to do is express the same idea. S ome people get confused, I think, that translation is taking a word in one lan guage and giving a similar sounding word in another. But it’s not about the wo rds, it’s about the ideas that you’re expressing.

Francine is trying to translate a letter and a docu ment – some other sort of piece of paper – into McQuish. But she says, “Even with a  dictionary and a thesaurus, it’s slow going.” A “dictionary” is a book that has  the meanings of words. You can have a bilingual dictionary, which gives the word i n one language and a translation in another, or you can have a what we c ould call a “regular” dictionary that just has the words and the meanings all in the  same language. A “thesaurus” (thesaurus) is a book that lists groups of similar words, words that have similar meanings. It’s a book you use when you’re trying to  find a word that has a similar idea but you want to use something different. A “th esaurus” will help you find similar words. It’s not a definition of the word. I t’s a listing of words in that category. “To be slow going” means to be making ver y slow progress. It’s something that’s taking a lot of time, perhaps beca use it’s difficult to do. It’s slow going.

Aziz says, “Didn’t you tell Jim that?”  - “that” me aning that it’s slow going even with a dictionary and a thesaurus. Francine says, “ I did. But he still wants me to

try because it’s hard to find a McQuish-English bil ingual.” A “bilingual” (bilingual) is someone who speaks two languages. “Bi” (bi) is a  prefix that often means two. So, “bilingual” means two languages – someone who s peaks two languages. Someone who speaks three languages would be a “tril ingual” (trilingual). After that, we usually use a completely different word to  describe someone who speaks four or more languages. That word is “polygl ot” (polyglot). But Francine is talking about a McQuish-English bilingual – someone  who speaks McQuish and someone who speaks English. They should talk to me.

Aziz says, “I’m not surprised. Other than you, I do n’t know anyone who speaks McQuish.” Francine says, “Yeah. Well, I’m doing my best to translate these documents idiomatically, because the literal transl ation wouldn’t make any sense.” An “idiom” (idiom) in a language is a set o f words that mean something different together than if you were just to look up  each individual word’s definition. So, for example, a “start up” could mean, if you ju st looked up the words in a dictionary, “start” meaning to begin, and “up” mean ing the opposite of down. But that isn’t in fact what “start up” means. A “start up,” as a noun, is a new company, often a new technology or Internet company, althoug h, the word is more generally used now to refer to any new company – ca n be a start up. Perhaps a better example would be a phrase like “It’s raining  cats and dogs.” This expression means it’s raining a lot. It’s raining a  great deal. It has nothing to do with cats and dogs falling down from the sky. It’s an idiomatic expression. The meaning of it is not something you can figure out f rom the individual words.

Well, “to translate a document idiomatically” means  to do so in a way that expresses the ideas in common phrases that are used  in that second or that language you are translating the document into. So,  idiomatic translations would be translations that express the idea, not just the  individual words. When you’re just taking each individual word and translating it , that would be what we would call a “literal translation.” “Literal” (literal) m eans the exact meaning for that one word but that one word by itself, not connected to any other words. A “literal translation isn’t, in my opinion, really a translat ion at all. A translation is taking the ideas from one language and expressing them in anot her. A “literal translation” is taking the idea of a word individually, without con sidering the other words in the sentence and translating that word which is really not a very useful thing to do. But, Francine is trying to translate the documents idiomatically. She says, “A literal translation won’t make any sense.” “To make  sense” means to be understandable, to be logical, to be rational. If y ou say, “It won’t make any sense,” you mean you won’t be able to understand it . She says this translation that she’s doing is a tough job. “I simply don’t kn ow enough business McQuish to know the equivalent words and phrases.” “Equivalent ” (equivalent) means equal to, the same as. Francine doesn’t know the right wo rds in McQuish – she says

“business McQuish” – for the words she knows and is  trying to translate in English.

Aziz says, “Can’t you just paraphrase and convey the general meaning by using a lot of loan words and cognates?” “To paraphrase” (paraphrase) means to express the same idea, the same general idea, but u sing different words. So, it’s not an exact translation. It’s sort of a summary of  the ideas. The verb “to convey,” (convey) means to express or to share some informat ion. “To convey the meaning” means to communicate the meaning. “To conv ey the general meaning” would be to be able to have the other person unders tand the meaning that you are trying to give them. A “loan (loan) word” is a word that is borrowed from another language. Sometimes it has a similar meanin g as it does in the language that you borrow it from. Sometimes it has a slightl y different meaning. In English, we use the French expression “Bon appétit” to mean have a good meal, enjoy your meal. A “cognate” (cognate) is a word that is similar to a word in another language. It has the same or similar sound or spell ing. So, there are some words, for example, in English and in Spanish, that are co gnates. They mean basically the same thing, but there are a lot of words that a re what we would call “false cognates.” They sound the same but they mean someth ing very different.

Francine says, “I’m trying but I don’t think it’s t urning out the way it’s supposed to.” I don’t think the result of doing this paraphr asing and using loan words and cognates is giving me the result we want. Aziz says , “At least he” – Jim – “didn’t ask you to interpret.” “To interpret” (interpret) m eans to translate while you are speaking. So, “translation” refers to taking the wr iting and putting it in another language. “Interpretation” means that the other per son is speaking and then you translate the meaning in your head and speak the se cond language.

So, if you go to the United Nations, for example, t hey have what are called “interpreters.” The interpreters interpret; they tr anslate orally. Aziz said that if Francine had to interpret, she’d really be in the h ot seat. “To be in the hot seat” (seat) means to be in a difficult situation, a situ ation that would give you a lot of problems. Francine says, “Yeah. At least I was spar ed that experience – at least for now.” “To be spared” (spared) means that you do n’t have to experience something, usually something bad, something unpleas ant. Someone might say, “I’ll spare you the details,” meaning I won’t give you all of the details because they are very painful to listen to or unpleasant to  hear. Aziz says, “I wish I could help you but the only language I speak – other than  English – is Gibberish.” “Gibberish” (gibberish) are words that don’t make a ny sense. They don’t have any meaning. They are just sounds that you say as t hough they were language but in fact, the words are just nonsense [speaks gi bberish] – that’s gibberish. It doesn’t mean anything. Most of what I say is gibber ish, I think.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Francine:  Do you know the word in Mcquish for “par tnership”?

Aziz:  No, I don’t speak Mcquish. What are you doin g?

Francine:  Jim gave me this letter and this documen t to translate into Mcquish because I speak a little of it, but even with a dic tionary and thesaurus, it’s slow going.

Aziz:  Didn’t you tell Jim that?

Francine:  I did, but he still wants me to try beca use it’s so hard to find a Mcquish-English bilingual.

Francine:  Yeah, well, I’m doing my best to transla te these documents idiomatically because the literal translation won’t  make any sense, but it’s a tough job. I simply don’t know enough business Mcquish to  know the equivalent words and phrases.

# Adopting a Child

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 841: Adopting a Child.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 841. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Scott and Roberta about adopting a child. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Scott:  Hi, I thought I’d stop by to pick up those chairs I wanted to borrow.

Roberta:  Oh, sure. Here they are.

Scott:  What are you doing?

Roberta:  I’m looking through the material we got o n adoption.

Scott:  Are you and Robert thinking about adopting a child?

Roberta:  Yeah, we are. We’ve been thinking about i t for a long time, and we think we might be ready now.

Scott:  Have you decided on an international or dom estic adoption?

Roberta:  We’re going domestic.

Scott:  That means going through the foster care sy stem, right?

Roberta:  Yeah, it’s going to be a lot of work gett ing our house ready and all of the paperwork done. But after we pass inspection, w e’ll just need to wait for a call from a social worker with a placement. We hope it’l l happen quickly.

Scott:  I thought people had to wait months or year s for a baby.

Roberta:  They may, but we’re asking for a waiting child, maybe even one with special needs. We may even take more than one child , someone with siblings.

 Scott:  Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility. Wouldn ’t you rather do a private adoption? Then you can call the shots and even have  a closed adoption, if that’s what you want.

Roberta:  We don’t mind an open adoption, actually.  We’ve given it a lot of thought, and we think it’s best if the child knows who his or her birth parents are. That way, they won’t always be wondering.

Scott:  I hope everything goes smoothly. I’m sure y ou’ll both make great parents.

Roberta:  We’re not so sure, but we’ll do our best.  By the way, you can keep those chairs.

Scott:  Really? Why?

Roberta:  You have no children and they’re a hazard . We need to childproof this house and we’re starting with those chairs.

Scott:  Hey, that’s great. That big-screen TV looks  dangerous. I’d be more than happy to take it off your hands, too.

Roberta:  Hands off the TV!

[end of dialog]

Scott begins our dialog by saying to Roberta, “Hi, I thought I’d stop by to pick up those chairs I wanted to borrow.” “To stop by” mean s to go to a place, usually on your way to another place, though not always. “To p ick up,” here means to collect from, to get from. Scott is picking up some chairs.  Roberta says, “Oh, sure. Here they are.” Here, you can take them. Scott says, “Wh at are you doing?” Roberta says, “None of your business, Scott!”  No, she does n’t say that. She says, “I’m looking through the material we got on adoption.” “ Adoption” is the process of bringing a child into your family who is not biolog ically yours – that is, you’re not the mother or the father but for many different rea sons, the mother and/or father is not able to, or not willing, to keep the child. And so, the child may go to another family and become part of that family. We call that  process “adoption” (adoption).

Scott says, “Are you and Robert thinking about adop ting a child?” Roberta is married to Robert, I guess – that’s convenient. Rob erta says, “Yeah, we are. We’ve been thinking about it for a long time and we  think we might be ready now.” Scott says, “Have you decided on an internati onal or domestic adoption?”

“Domestic” (domestic) means within one country, usu ally the country where you are living. So a “domestic adoption,” in the United  States, would be adopting a child from the United States, who was born here, an d “international adoption,” of course, would be adopting a child from a different country. Roberta answers, “We’re going domestic,” meaning we are going to go for a domestic adoption. Scott says, “That means going through the foster ca re system, right?” The “foster (foster) care system” is the government system that  takes care of children whose parents can’t take care of them. Usually in the fos ter care system a child is taken from its mother or father and put into what we call  a “foster home.” They’re not adopted – at least, they don’t have to be adopted b y that family.

“Foster parents” take care of children who are not their own but don’t adopt them, or at least, they’re not required to adopt them. “T o adopt someone” means to make them legally part of your family. Roberta says , “Yeah. It’s going to be a lot of work getting our house ready and all of the pape rwork done” – all of the forms that they have to fill out. “But after we pass insp ection, we’ll just need to wait for a call from a social worker with a placement.” “To pa ss” means to be approved. “Inspection” is a detailed examination of whether s omeone has done what they are supposed to do.

If you’re going to be a foster parent in the United  States, in most places, you have to prepare your home. You have to go to a lot of interviews. You have to be investigated by the government and the government w ill usually send someone to inspect your home, to look at your house to make  sure it’s safe for a child to be there. That’s why Roberta says “after we pass inspe ction, we’ll need to wait for a call from a social worker.” A “social worker” is a person whose job it is to help children, to help families, who are having difficul ties. Usually the social worker works for the government. “Social workers” take car e of placing children into foster families, children who need someone to take care of them. That’s what a social worker does, or at least one of the things a  social worker does.

A “placement” (placement) is an arrangement, in thi s case, for a child to live with a foster family. So, once you are approved as a fos ter family, then you wait until the government has someone that needs taking care o f. They may call you and say, “Tomorrow, we’re going to bring by a five year  old girl,” or “Next week, you are going to have a ten year old boy,” and so forth . By agreeing to be a foster family, you agree to take the child that the govern ment gives you, although there’s some choice there in some cases, I would gu ess.

Scott says, “I thought people had to wait months or  years for a baby?” It’s true that in the United States, the adoption process tak es a very long time, especially if you are adopting domestically. It’s quicker in m any instances, in many cases, if

you adopt internationally. Roberta says, “They may.  But we’re asking for a waiting child, maybe even one with special needs.” A “waiting child” is a child who is waiting to be adopted. Sometimes the child i s first put into a foster family. If the foster family is also interested in adopting , they can, in some cases, adopt the child. Roberta mentions “special needs.” “Speci al needs” is a term we use to describe children who may have some physical or men tal disabilities, some problems. Maybe they have some physical problems. M aybe they’ve had some psychological problems – that would be a child with  special needs.

Roberta says, “We may even take more than one child , someone with siblings.” “Siblings” (siblings) are your brothers and sisters . I have ten siblings – eight brothers, two sisters. Scott says, “Wow, that’s a l ot of responsibility. Wouldn’t you rather do a private adoption?” A “private adoption”  is an adoption arranged between a family and the mother, or parents of a ch ild, without the help of the government, without the government being part of the process, usually without the child going through the foster care system. Sco tt says, “Then you can call the shots and even have a closed adoption if that’s wha t you want.” “To call the shots” (shots) is an informal expression, meaning t o be making the decisions, to be the person who makes the important decisions. the boss calls the shots at his company, for example.

Scott recommends, or at least suggests, that Robert a and her husband have a closed adoption. A “closed adoption” is an adoption  where the mother or parents of the child never actually meet the people who are  adopting the child. They may not even know who that family is. Closed adoptions used to be very common in the United States. They are less common now. In fac t, I think most adoptions are not closed adoptions. If they are domestic adoption s in the U.S, they are instead “open adoptions.” “Open adoptions” is when the moth er or the mother and father know who the parents are. They may meet with the ne w adopting couple in order to find out if they like the couple, if that’s the family they want their child to be raised in. Open adoptions are much more common nowa days than they were, even 30, 40 years ago.

Roberta says, “We don’t mind an open adoption actua lly.” “We don’t mind” means we’re okay with that, that’s not a problem. “ We’ve given it a lot of thought.” We thought about it. “And we think it’s b est if the child knows who his or her birth parents are. Your “birth parents” are the  biological mother and father that you have. Everyone has a biological mother and  father, even if you don’t live with them or grow up with them. It’s not possible not  to have a biological mother and father. Roberta says, “That way, they won’t alw ays be wondering.” This is a, as you can imagine, a topic that a lot of adopting parents think about – whether

they want the child to know who their real – or bio logical, I should say – parents are or not.

Scott says, “I hope everything goes smoothly. I’ su re you’ll both make great parents.” Roberta says, “We’re not so sure but we’l l do our best. By the way, you can keep those chairs.” Scott says, “Really? Why?” Remember Scott came over to borrow some chairs from Roberta and Robert. Robe rta says, “You have no children and they’re a hazard.” “They” here means t he chairs, not children. Children could be a hazard too, I suppose. A “hazar d” (hazard) is something that is or could be dangerous. Roberta says, “We need to  childproof this house.” “To childproof” (childproof) – one word – means to make  an area safe for a baby or for young children, getting rid of things that migh t be dangerous. If you have guns in your house, you would probably have to remove th em or lock them up in order to childproof your house.

Scott says, “Hey, that’s great. That big screen TV looks dangerous.” Scott is joking now, saying, “Well, if you have to get rid o f things that are dangerous in your house, how about your television?” – which, of  course, is not dangerous, unless you watch it. Some of the programs are poten tially hazardous. Scott says, “I’d be more than happy to take it off your hands.”  “To take something off your hands” means to take something that another person doesn’t want anymore or doesn’t need any more. Roberta says, “Hands off the  TV.” The expression “hands (hands) off” means do not touch, don’t come close to. She, of course, is not going to let Scott take their big screen, their  large television, because that’s not part of childproofing a house.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Scott:  Hi, I thought I’d stop by to pick up those chairs I wanted to borrow.

Roberta:  Oh, sure. Here they are.

Scott:  What are you doing?

Roberta:  I’m looking through the material we got o n adoption.

Scott:  Are you and Robert thinking about adopting a child?

Roberta:  Yeah, we are. We’ve been thinking about i t for a long time, and we think we might be ready now.

 Scott:  Have you decided on an international or dom estic adoption?

Roberta:  We’re going domestic.

Scott:  That means going through the foster care sy stem, right?

Roberta:  Yeah, it’s going to be a lot of work gett ing our house ready and all of the paperwork done. But after we pass inspection, w e’ll just need to wait for a call from a social worker with a placement. We hope it’l l happen quickly.

# Taking a Standardized Test

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 842: Taking a Standardized Test

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 842. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Eslpod.com is the place to go for a Learning Guide to this episode. You’ll improve your English faster than you thought possib le.

This episode is a dialog between a father and his d aughter, Maria, about having to take certain kinds of tests in school, what are called “standardized tests.” Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Dad:  It’s time you start preparing for the MCFL Te st.

Maria:  Dad, that’s 12 months away! I don’t need to  start looking at test prep materials right now.

Dad:  Yes, you do. Like all high-stakes testing, fa miliarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you. You need t o score well on it if you want to be admitted to a good university. The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d better be prepared when the time com es.

Maria:  I don’t really believe in standardized test s. Our teacher says that they don’t really measure how well you’ll do in college or in life.

Dad:  It doesn’t matter what you – or your teacher – believe. Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s importa nt. Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questio ns.

Maria:  I know all about taking standardized tests,  Dad. I’ve been taking them every year at school and I’m sick of them. Put your  name here. Bubble in your answer there. I’m sick to death of those tests.

Dad:  Then you’ll feel perfectly comfortable taking  this one.

Maria:  Why can’t they give us open-ended or essay questions? I’d do much better on those.

Dad:  Bite your tongue! Those would be much more di fficult to study for. Ready for question number one?

Maria:  As ready as I’ll ever be.

[end of dialog]

Dad begins by saying to Maria, “It’s time you start  preparing for the MCFL Test.” “MCFL” (MCFL) is not a real test. It sounds a littl e like the TOEFL Test, however. Dad says, “It’s time you start preparing.” You need  to start preparing for or working on your MCFL Test. You have to get ready to  take it. Maria says, “Dad, that’s 12 months away.” That’s 12 months from now, when I’ll have to actually take that test. “I don’t need to start looking at t est prep materials right now.” “Test prep” – “prep” stands for preparation – is time spe nt studying a subject that you are going to be tested on. If you’re going to take a math test, you might want to prepare by studying test prep materials about math.  “Test prep” usually refers to taking tests that are official examinations, tests that are, as we’ll see in a moment, “standardized.”

Dad says, “Yes you do. Like all high-stakes testing , familiarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you.” “High-sta kes” is an expression used for something that is very important, depending on what  happens. If it goes one way, there will be major consequences. It will have sign ificant results. “High-stakes testing” is testing that determines, for example, w hether a student can go to college or not. In some countries, there are nation al examinations and all of the students who want to go to the university have to t ake an exam. That’s an example of a high-stakes test. We have similar exam s here in the United States for college, the most popular being the SAT Exam.

Dad says that “Familiarity with the types of questi ons you’ll be asked will help you.” “To be familiar” (familiar) means to know abo ut something. So, familiarity is describing how much you know about a certain thing,  how much knowledge you have. Dad is saying that if you understand the kind s of questions on the test, you’ll do better, which is generally true.

Dad says, “You need to score well on it if you want  to be admitted to a good university.” “To score well” means to do well on an  examination. “I scored well on my math exam.” “I got a good grade.” “I got a good result.” “To score” can also mean to get more points in a game, an athletic comp etition like a soccer game or

a football game. Maria needs to score well if she w ants to be admitted to a good university. “To be admitted” means to be invited to  be a student there. “The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d  better be prepared when the time comes.” “Administer” means to, in this cas e, offer the examination. It’s a time when you can take the test. The test will be a dministered at 4 o’clock in the auditorium – the big place where people meet. That’ s where the test will be administered. That’s where it will be given.

Maria says, “I don’t really believe in standardized  tests.” The word “standardized” is in the title of this episode. It refers to exami nations that many different people have taken and that a statistical analysis has been  made so that you know, generally speaking, what percentage of people score  here, what percentage of people score with this amount of points and so fort h. “Standardized tests” are tests that are developed usually by special testing  companies. And they make sure that the tests are all fair, that the test wil l give you the same result if you take it on Monday versus if you take it on Friday. They look at the questions of the tests to make sure that they’re asking what the y’re supposed to be asking and so forth. That’s a standardized test. In the Un ited States, we have lots of standardized tests in our schools. The most popular  one, as I mentioned before, is the SAT – the Scholastic Achievement Test – whic h helps determine whether you are going to go to a university or not.

Maria says, “Our teacher says that they” – the stan dardized tests – “don’t really measure how well you do in college or in life.” “To  measure” (measure) here means to determine how important something is, to d etermine the value of something. Maria says that her teacher says that st andardized tests don’t really measure how well you do in college or in life. “Mea sure” has a couple of other meanings in English as well. Take a look at our Lea rning Guide for those.

Maria’s father disagrees with Maria and her teacher . He says, “It doesn’t matter what you or your teacher believe.” “It doesn’t matt er” means it’s not important. He says, “Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s important.” The colleges in universities look at how well you d o on these tests to decide if you are going to get into or be admitted to that co llege.

Dad says, “Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questions.” A “tip” (tip) is a small piece of advic e about something, how to do something better. A “multiple (multiple) choice (ch oice) question” is a question where you have two or more possible answers, possib le options. You have to select which one is correct. Typically, there are f our or five options on a multiple choice question. With a “true-false” question, you have only two options, either the statement – the sentence – is true or it’s fals e. Minneapolis is the capital of

Minnesota, true or false? False. St. Paul is the ca pital of Minnesota. That’s a true-false question.

Maria says, “I know all about taking standardized t ests dad. I’ve been taking them every year at school and I’m sick of them.” “T o be sick of something” means you’re tired of them. You don’t want to have anymore. Maria says, “Put your name here. Bubble in your answer there. I’m si ck to death of those tests.” What Maria is doing is she’s imitating the directio ns, the instructions you get when you take one of these exams. “Put your name he re.” Write your name here. “Bubble in your answer there.” On many standardized  tests, most, perhaps, all standardized tests really; you answer the questions  by filling in little circles with a pencil. This is to “bubble in.” It’s kind of a weir d expression. “Bubble” (bubble) has some other meanings in English as well. Take a look at our Learning Guide for those. But “to bubble in” means to fill in the little circle that indicates what you think the correct answer is for that question. Mari a says, “I’m sick to death of those tests.” “To be sick to death” means the same as to be sick of something. It means you are tired of them. You don’t want to take  them anymore.

Dad says, “Then you’ll feel perfectly comfortable t aking this one.” He’s saying, “Well, if you’re so familiar with these tests, this  next test won’t be any problem.” Maria says, “Why can’t they give us open-ended or e ssay questions.” An “open- ended question” is a question that doesn’t have jus t one answer. It’s a question that may require a couple of sentences to answer an d that could have a lot of different answers. An “essay (essay) question” is a  question that requires, usually, several paragraphs to answer. “Describe the three main causes of the Civil War in the United States.” Well, you can’t an swer that in a few words. It would require several paragraphs at least. That’s a n essay question. Standardized tests often don’t have these kinds of questions because a computer cannot easily score them. A computer canno t easily determine which answers you got right or wrong. Someone actually ha s to read the questions and read the answers, more importantly, in order to giv e you a score.

Dad says, “Bite your tongue.” “To bite (bite) your tongue (tongue)” is simply an expression, meaning to be quiet, to stop talking ab out this. Dad says, “Those would be much more difficult to study for” - “those ” meaning open-ended and essay questions. “Ready for question number one?” D ad says. Dad is going to prepare her for the test. Maria says, “As ready as I’ll ever be.” This is a phrase we use when you are showing that you are willing to  do something but that you probably don’t really want to do it and that you’re  not very well prepared to do it. “As ready as I’ll ever be,” Maria says.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Dad:  It’s time you start preparing for the MCFL Te st.

Maria:  Dad, that’s 12 months away! I don’t need to  start looking at test prep materials right now.

Dad:  Yes, you do. Like all high-stakes testing, fa miliarity with the types of questions you’ll be asked will help you. You need t o score well on it if you want to be admitted to a good university. The MCFL is only administered twice each year, so you’d better be prepared when the time com es.

Maria:  I don’t really believe in standardized test s. Our teacher says that they don’t really measure how well you’ll do in college or in life.

Dad:  It doesn’t matter what you – or your teacher – believe. Colleges consider test scores in admissions and that’s what’s importa nt. Let’s start with some tips on answering multiple choice and true-false questio ns.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 843: Passing Through Airport Security.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 843. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Roland and Natalie  about going to the airport and having to pass through or go through security. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Roland:  Why are you so nervous about flying?

Natalie:  I’m not nervous about being in the air. I t’s going through security. I hear it’s a hassle and I don’t want to end up being stri p-searched.

Roland:  You won’t be strip-searched. All you need to do is to follow a few simple rules. When you get to security screening, put your  carry-on bag and all metal objects in a bin so that it can go through the scan ner.

Natalie:  But I heard I couldn’t bring any liquids with me.

Roland:  You’re only allowed three ounces of liquid s, aerosols, or gels. Those should go inside a zip-top bag and be placed in a b in.

Natalie:  Do I have to take off my shoes and get on e of those body scans?

Roland:  You don’t have to take off your shoes, but  you do have to get a body scan.

Natalie:  I knew it! They’re going to bombard me wi th harmful rays. And you wonder why I’m nervous about flying!

Roland:  You won’t be bombarded with any harmful ra ys. You walk through the metal detector and stand in front of the scanner. I t’s not dangerous.

Natalie:  Oh, why do they have to treat every passe nger like a potential hijacker or terrorist? Do I look like a terrorist? I feel li ke walking through security with my hands up saying, “I am not a terrorist. I am not a terrorist.”

Roland:  I wouldn’t do that if I were you. That’s a  sure way to get the TSA’s attention. Just stay calm and follow the instructio ns.

Natalie:  Just like a lamb to the slaughter?

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Roland saying to Natalie, “W hy are you so nervous about flying?” Why are you so anxious about going into an  airplane? Natalie says, “I’m not nervous about being in the air.” I’m not worrie d about actually flying, she says. “It’s going through security.” “Security” (se curity) at an airport, or at some sort of public venue – that is, some sort of place where lots of different people go in and out of – is the process of checking people t o make sure they don’t have anything dangerous. Especially in the last 10 years  or so, in the United States, there has been a lot more airport security, where t hey check each person coming into the airport, each person who is flying, each p assenger, for any sort of dangerous materials they may have. Obviously, this is in response to the attacks of 9/11.

Natalie says, “I hear it’s a hassle and I don’t wan t to end up being strip- searched.” Natalie has heard that it’s a “hassle” ( hassle) to go through security at the airport. A “hassle” is a pain, something that i s inconvenient, something that is unpleasant. “To be strip-searched” means they take all of your or most of your clothing off, and this is typically done when they are looking for drugs or something else that you might try to sneak on the a irplane, to get onto the airplane without permission. Most security at airpo rts in the United States, do not do strip-searches, at least not for the average pas senger. “To strip” (strip) means to take your clothes off. The word is also used for  women who take their clothes off slowly, for reasons of sexual entertainment, sh all we say.

Roland says, “You won’t be strip-searched. All you need to do is to follow a few simple rules. When you get to security screening, p ut your carry-on bag and all metal objects in a bin.” So, Roland is saying it’s not that difficult. And he’s right. It really isn’t that difficult to go through security at an American airport if you understand a few simple things. Roland talks about “security screening” (screening). “Screening” is the process of looking something over very carefully, in this case, searching for things that should not be there. So, when you go into an American airport, there’ll be a long line of peo ple waiting to go through the

screening area. That’s the place where the governme nt officials or the airport security people look at you and make sure that you don’t have anything you’re not supposed to have.

Roland says, “When you get to security screening, p ut your carry-on bag and all metal objects in a bin.” Your “carry-on bag” is the  piece of luggage or baggage that you are taking with you in your hand. That’s w hy it’s called “carry-on,” because you can carry it onto the plane. Metal obje cts would be keys, coins, anything made of metal. All of those have to go int o a little bucket, a small container which is called a “bin” (bin). Actually, it’s not that little. A bin is typically a large bucket but the bins at the airport are not huge. They’re enough to put a small bag in, a few shoes, a computer, that sort of  thing. When you go through an American airport now, they have to put those obj ects into a “scanner” (scanner). A “scanner” is the machine that looks for anything that should not be there. Basically, it’s a kind of video camera that is looking at all of your stuff and seeing that there isn’t any hidden objects, there a ren’t any hidden objects, there aren’t any things that shouldn’t be there.

Natalie says, “I heard I couldn’t bring any liquids  with me.” “Liquids” (liquids) are things that are wet, things like water, soda – thos e are all liquids. Roland says, “You’re only allowed three ounces of liquids, aeros ols, or gels.” So, you can bring small amounts of liquid, three ounces or less. You can also bring three ounces of aerosols or gels. “Aerosols” (aerosols) is liquid t hat is dispensed or delivered by pressing a little button on the top of a container.  So, “hairspray,” for example, might be an aerosol that you would bring with you. I always bring hairspray on the airplane with me. “Gels” (gels) are thick, wet liquids. Again, you might find these for hair. There are certain kinds of things t hat women put on their hair, and men, that are called “gels.” It’s kind of a very th ick liquid. But it’s not water. It’s thicker than that.

Roland says, “Those should go inside a zip-top” – o r a zip-lock – “bag and placed in a bin.” A “zip (zip) – top (top) bag” is a clear  plastic bag that has a little, what looks like a zipper on the top of it, so you can op en and close it easily. A “zip-top bag” – and I call them “zip-lock bags,” because the re’s a company that makes these kinds of bags called “zip-lock” (lock) at the  end – “zip-top” or “zip-lock” bag is used to put your small containers of liquids int o, before they go through the scanner. It’s required that you take them out of yo ur carry-on bags and put them into these little plastic bags so that the security  people can see them.

Natalie says, ”Do I have to take off my shoes and g et one of those body scans?” In many American airports, it used to be required a nd I think it might still be – these rules change a lot – that you have to take yo ur shoes off before you go

through the security scanner. Now it’s always the c ase, I think, that you have to do that. A “body scan” is an image of a person’s en tire body. Some airports in the United States, recently, here in 2012, have started  to put these machines that scan the entire body. A lot of people don’t like th is. Basically, it’s like an X-ray, a picture of your entire body that the security peopl e can see. Roland says, “You don’t have to take off your shoes but you do have t o get a body scan.” I’ve gone through the airport many times. Usually, here in Lo s Angeles, you have to take your shoes off and you often will get a body scan, not always, but many times.

Natalie says, “I knew it. They’re going to bombard me with harmful rays.” “To bombard (bombard) someone” means to, usually to att ack them. It’s a word we would use, for example, during a war, where one sid e is dropping bombs on the other side – “to bombard.” But here, Natalie means she’s just going to get a lot of something, in this case, a lot of harmful “rays” (r ays). “Ray” here is referring to “X-rays,” what a doctor would give you to see, for example, if you had broken a bone. “And you wonder why I’m nervous about flying, ” Natalie says. She doesn’t want to get all of these harmful X-rays. Roland cor rects her by saying, “You won’t be bombarded with any harmful rays. You walk throug h a metal detector and stand in front of the scanner. It’s not dangerous.”  A “metal detector” is the usual way that you are screened at an airport or somewher e. A metal detector just determines whether you have any metal on your body,  such as a gun, for example. A “body scanner” actually takes a photogra ph of your entire body. Most airports have metal detectors, not body scanners, a lthough a lot of the larger U.S airports now have body scanners and metal detectors . But Roland says these are not dangerous.

Natalie says, “Oh, why do they have to treat every passenger” – every person flying – “like a potential hijacker or terrorist?” A “hijacker” (hijacker) is a person who takes control of a plane illegally, usually to take that plane to a different place or to get money, or in the case of 9/11, to a ttack different buildings. That’s a hijacker. You can hijack a plane, but you could a lso hijack a bus or even a car. It’s to take control of something by force. A “terr orist” is a person who is involved in using violence to threaten or to scare other peo ple in order to get them to do what he or she wants them to do.

Natalie says, “Do I look like a terrorist? I feel l ike walking through security with my hands up saying, ‘I am not a terrorist. I am not  a terrorist.’” Roland says, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” He’s saying that’s  not a good idea. You don’t want to make any jokes when you go through security even  if you think they’re funny. He says, “That’s a sure way” – a certain way – “to get the TSA’s attention.” The TSA, here in the United States, is the Transportati on Security Administration. It’s

the part of the U.S government that is now responsi ble for safety at our airports. Roland says, “Just stay calm and follow the instruc tions.”

Natalie says, “Just like a lamb to the slaughter?” This phrase, a “lamb,” which is a kind of an animal, “to the slaughter,” which is whe n you kill an animal, is used to describe someone who is calmly and obediently doing  something that will end up in trouble, pain, or possibly even death, because t hey don’t realize what they are doing. The most common way of saying this is a “lam b led (led) to the slaughter” – someone is leading the, someone is taking them an d they are going quietly and without any sort of protest to something that may b e very harmful for them. Natalie, of course, is exaggerating here. Airport s ecurity really isn’t that bad in the United States. It’s not that bad of an experience, considering the benefits of having a system like what we have.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Roland:  Why are you so nervous about flying?

Natalie:  I’m not nervous about being in the air. I t’s going through security. I hear it’s a hassle and I don’t want to end up being stri p-searched.

This episode is a dialog between Vera and Keigo about government officials, government workers, who aren’t honest. Let’s get started.  [start of dialog]  Vera:  I can’t believe that Stan has been arrested. I know that he wasn’t always on the up-and-up, but he’s being accused of influence peddling and taking bribes.  Keigo:  Stan has been getting kickbacks for years. Everybody knew that if you wanted to get what you wanted from this department, you had to grease Stan’s palms. There isn’t a more corrupt official than Stan.  Vera:  But he was always so nice to me.    Keigo:  That was part of the problem. He was always good to his friends and family. That’s why he’s also known for his nepotism and cronyism. He gave friends and family plum jobs with big salaries. He had an entire good old boy network.  Vera:  Do you really think he’ll go to jail?  Keigo:  I’m sure of it. On second thought, if he can find a judge who’s on the take and is as corrupt as he is, he has a fighting chance.  [end of dialog] # Dropping Out of College

This episode is a dialog between Aaron and Margo ab out leaving college before you are finished. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Aaron:  Mom, I have something to tell you and you’r e not going to like it.

Margo:  What is it?

Aaron:  I’m dropping out of college. I want to get out into the real world and get a job. I’m wasting time in school.

Margo:  You’ll get a better job if you stay in scho ol and graduate with a degree. You’ll have more earning power and better long-term  prospects.

Aaron:  I’m sick of school. All of my friends are e arning money, buying cars, and living life. I feel like life is passing me by.

Margo:  Your friends didn’t go to college and got a  job right out of high school.

Aaron:  That’s right. There’s nothing wrong with th at.

Margo:  No, there isn’t. And right now, they seem t o be living the high life. They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on having fun. Once they have a family, their paychecks won’t stretch v ery far. With a degree, you’ll out-earn them right out of the gate when you gradua te in two years.

Aaron:  I don’t want to wait.

Margo:  This is all about delayed gratification. A little suffering now will pay off in the long run. Trust me. Two more years and you’ll b e done.

Aaron:  Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more  years and then no more school – ever!

Margo:  Unless you decide to go to graduate school. ..

Aaron:  Mom, don’t push it.

[end of dialog]

Aaron says to Margo, who we find out is his mother,  “Mom, I have something to tell you and you’re not going to like it.” This, of  course, is the worst way to begin any conversation. “I have something to tell you and  you’re not going to like what I have to tell you.” Margo says – Aaron’s mom – “What  is it?”

Aaron says, “I’m dropping out of college.” “To drop  out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop going to school before you hav e completed your education, before you have received your degree or certificate . You can drop out of high school. We have many young people who stop going to  high school after they turn 16 years old. In the United States, in most st ates, you can leave high school when you turn 16, even though you haven’t completed  your high school diploma or certificate. The normal age is 18 to complete hi gh school – 17 or 18. It is possible to stop going to school before that. That’ s what we call “dropping out.” You can also drop out of college, leave college bef ore you finish your degree. That’s what Aaron wants to do.

He says, “I want to get out into” – or to go into –  “the real world and get a job.” When people say “the real world,” they mean not ins ide of a school, to be out where people are working, doing things like making money. Aaron says, “I’m wasting time in school.” “To waste time” means you aren’t doing anything very useful or productive. Margo says, “You’ll get a bet ter job if you stay in school and graduate with a degree.” Margo is trying to convinc e her son that if he wants to get a good job, he should stay in school and gradua te. “To graduate” means to complete your program. I graduated from high school  in 1981. That’s when I completed my high school degree – my high school “d iploma”, we would call it. “Degree” is usually a word we use when you finish s ome sort of college program. You can have an undergraduate degree, what we call a “Bachelor’s degree,” or you could have a “graduate degree,” such as a Maste r’s or a doctorate.

Margo says, “You’ll have more earning power and bet ter long term prospects.” Margo was saying to Aaron: If you graduate with a d egree, you’ll have more “earning power.” “Earning” (earning) refers to gett ing money by working. “Earning power” is the ability to make a lot of money from y our work. “Long-term” means for a very long time. “Prospects” (prospects) refer  to opportunities. So, “long-term prospects” are your opportunities for the future, f or many years into the future.

Aaron says, however, “I’m sick of school” I’m tired  of school. “All of my friends are earning money, buying cars, and living life” – living a normal life. “I feel like life is passing me by.” The expression, “life is pa ssing me by,” or passing someone by, means that you feel that your life is v ery boring, that you’re getting older but you’re not getting more out of life. You’ re not enjoying life the way other people enjoy life. That’s the meaning of the expres sion “Life is passing me by.”

Margo says, “Your friends didn’t go to college and got a job right out of high school,” meaning immediately after they finished hi gh school. Aaron says, “That’s right” – that’s correct. “There is nothing wrong wi th that,” meaning that’s okay. Margo says, “No. There isn’t.” She’s agreeing with Aaron that there isn’t anything wrong with getting a job when you graduate from hig h school and not going to college.

However, she’s also reminding Aaron that in the fut ure he will be better off than his friends. He will have a better job than his fri ends because he did wait to get a job and go to college instead. Margo says, “Right n ow” – at this moment – “your friends seem to be living the high life.” The “high  (high) life” is a relaxed, comfortable, exciting life, spending a lot of money  on your own comfort, your own entertainment, a good life. And that’s what Margo i s saying that Aaron’s friends are doing right now. “They’re living the high life.  They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on ha ving fun.” “To blow (blow) your money on something” means to spend it on somet hing that isn’t very important, or to waste your money on something that  isn’t very useful. I’m going to go to Vegas and gamble. I’m going to go to Las V egas and play cards and gamble a million dollars. I’m going to blow a milli on dollars. Well, I don’t have a million dollars but it’s just an example. “To blow it” means to waste it – to lose it, in this case.

Margo says that Aaron’s friends can blow their payc hecks on having fun. Your “paycheck” is the money you receive for working at your job. Margo says, “Once they have a family” – once they get married and hav e children – “their paychecks won’t stretch very far.” “To not stretch (stretch) very far” means they won’t be able to pay for everything they want and need becau se they won’t have enough money. So, if you only have to worry about yourself , you may be able to buy

whatever you want. But when you get married and hav e a family and have children, well then, your money will not stretch ve ry far. You will have less money to spend because you have more things to buy.

Margo says, “With a degree” – with a college degree  – “you’ll out-earn them” – your friends – “right out of the gate when you grad uate in two years.” “To out- earn” means to earn more than, to get more money at  a job than the other people. To “out-“ anything means to do more of that . You can out-perform. You can out-sing. You could out-swim, meaning you would  perform better. You would sing better. You would swim better than the other p eople. “Right out of the gate” (gate) means immediately. As soon as you graduate, right out of the gate, you will start to make more money than your friends.

Aaron says, “I don’t want to wait.” This, of course , is the problem of many young people. They do not understand that you need to wai t in order to good things in life if you spend time wisely. But they don’t want to wait. Margo says, “This is all about delayed gratification.” “Gratification” is ge tting good things in your life. “To delay” (delay) means to wait. So, “delayed gratific ation” is waiting for the good things. Many people can’t delay their gratification . They want gratification right now. And so, instead of going to college and gettin g a degree, they want to go out and get a job right away, or when they get mone y, the first thing they do is they spend their money, even though they should, pe rhaps, wait, save their money and buy something in the future instead. Marg o says, “A little suffering” – a little pain – “now, will pay off in the long run. ” “To pay off” means to be worthwhile, to have benefits. The “long run” means in the future, in the long term, which is an expression we used earlier.

Aaron’s mom says, “Trust me, two more years and you ’ll be done.” Aaron says, “Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more years. ” “To stick it out” means to wait, to delay. “And then no more school, ever.” Ma rgo says, “Unless you decide to go to graduate school.” “Graduate school” is whe re you go after you finish your Bachelor’s, if you want a Master’s or a doctorate i n something.

Aaron says, “Mom, don’t push it.” The expression “D on’t push it!” means stop right there. Don’t try to get a better deal or don’ t try to get even more out of this negotiation or this conversation. We often use the expression jokingly, humorously – “Don’t push it.” So, for example, your  daughter asks you if she can use your car to go to a movie. And you say, “Okay, fine.” And then she says, “Oh, and can you also pay for the movie?” You say to her , “Don’t push it,” meaning you’ve already gotten something good, don’t ask for  more.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Aaron:  Mom, I have something to tell you and you’r e not going to like it.

Margo:  What is it?

Aaron:  I’m dropping out of college. I want to get out into the real world and get a job. I’m wasting time in school.

Margo:  You’ll get a better job if you stay in scho ol and graduate with a degree. You’ll have more earning power and better long-term  prospects.

Aaron:  I’m sick of school. All of my friends are e arning money, buying cars, and living life. I feel like life is passing me by.

Margo:  Your friends didn’t go to college and got a  job right out of high school.

Aaron:  That’s right. There’s nothing wrong with th at.

Margo:  No, there isn’t. And right now, they seem t o be living the high life. They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on having fun. Once they have a family, their paychecks won’t stretch v ery far. With a degree, you’ll out-earn them right out of the gate when you gradua te in two years.

Aaron:  I don’t want to wait.

Margo:  This is all about delayed gratification. A little suffering now will pay off in the long run. Trust me. Two more years and you’ll b e done.

Aaron:  Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more  years and then no more school – ever!

Margo:  Unless you decide to go to graduate school. ..

Aaron:  Mom, don’t push it.

# Donating Blood

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 846: Donating Blood.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 846. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. I’m going to spe ak very low. No, not really.

We have a website. You know where it is. It’s at es lpod.com. Go there, become a member, help keep us going here at ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialog between Michelle and Gabri el about donating or giving some of your blood to people who need it. Let’s get  started!

[start of dialog]

Michelle:  Did you hurt yourself?

Gabriel:  No, why?

Michelle:  You have a Band-Aid on your arm.

Gabriel:  Oh, that. I donated blood today.

Michelle:  You did? That’s great. I’d like to donat e blood, but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed. I’m afraid if I go through with it, and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint.

Gabriel:  I’m used to it. I give blood all the time . The needle doesn’t bother me.

Michelle:  That’s very admirable. I know how import ant it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions.

Gabriel:  I don’t mind doing it. It’s not a big dea l.

Michelle:  But it is a big deal. If relief organiza tions didn’t have enough blood when they traveled to disaster areas, they couldn’t  help the injured people there. I’m sure that’s why you do it, right?

Gabriel:  Well...

 Michelle:  Well, what?

Gabriel:  There is a particularly pretty nurse who works in the bloodmobile...

Michelle:  Ah.

[end of dialog]

Michelle begins by saying to Gabriel, “Did you hurt  yourself?” Gabriel says, “No, why?” Michelle says, “You have a Band-Aid on your a rm.” A “Band-Aid” (band- aid) is actually the name of a product of a company  here in the United States. It’s a bandage. It’s a small piece of cotton that has a piece of tape on it that you put over a cut on your skin. So, if you cut your finger  and it’s bleeding – blood is coming out – you might put a Band-Aid on it. That i s a bandage. We say “Band- Aid” even when it’s not the bandage made by that co mpany. We have another similar term “Kleenex” (Kleenex), which is basicall y tissue paper you use to blow your nose, to clean out the inside of your nose, if  you will. We say “Kleenex” even though that’s technically just one company’s tissue  paper.

Michelle is asking if Gabriel hurt himself because he has a Band-Aid on his arm. Gabriel says, “Oh, that. I donated blood today.” “T o donate blood” means to give some of your blood to a hospital or to an organizat ion like the Red Cross, to help people who need blood. When you get hurt or sick an d go to a hospital, often they need to give you more blood. Where do they get  the blood? From people who donated.

Michelle says, “You did? That’s great! I’d like to donate blood but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed.” “Needle” ( needle) is that long, sharp thing they put inside of your body. They basically put a hole in your skin in order to get the blood out. You also use a needle for putting so mething into your body, like a drug. “Light-headed” is the same as dizzy, a feelin g that you may fall down. It feels like the world is spinning around you. That’s  to feel light-headed.

Michelle says, “I’m afraid if I go through with it and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint.” “To go through with something” means to do something that is, perhaps, difficult or even a little dangerous. But you go ah ead and do it anyway. You have the courage, the strength to do this difficult thin g. Michelle is afraid that if she goes through with it – if she actually goes to a pl ace to donate her blood – “and they actually draw blood,” meaning they actually ta ke blood out of her, “I’ll faint.” “To faint” (faint) is to, basically, lose conscious ness. You fall asleep. If you are standing, fall down and become unconscious, typical ly, for a short period of time.

 I’ve only fainted once in my life. I was…yeah, that  was a long time ago. I was sitting at a chair and someone was rubbing my neck.  I know it sounds a little weird. But someone was rubbing my neck and it was s o relaxing that I fainted. I can remember that very well. It was probably 25 yea rs ago. Well, some people faint when they hear bad news. Some people faint wh en they see something they don’t like, like blood.

Michelle is afraid that she’ll faint if she actuall y goes and donates blood. Gabriel says – because he’s a man – “I’m used to it. I give  blood all the time. The needle doesn’t bother me,” meaning it doesn’t cause me any  problems. Michelle says, “That’s very admirable.” Something that is “admirab le” (admirable) is something that is impressive, something that other people res pect, other people realize is important. Michelle says, “I know how important it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions.” “Transfus ions” are when a doctor at a hospital, typically, will be giving you new blood. They are transferring someone else’s blood into your body, for some medical reaso n.

Gabriel says, “I don’t mind doing it.” “I don’t min d” means it doesn’t bother me. It’s not a problem. He says, “It’s not a big deal,”  meaning it’s nothing that’s very important, nothing that causes any trouble. Michell e then says, “It is a big deal.” Here, “big deal” means something important, somethi ng makes a difference. She says, “If relief organizations didn’t have enough b lood when they travelled to disaster areas, they couldn’t help the injured peop le there. “Relief organizations” are organizations like the Red Cross or the Red Cre scent that go into areas where people are suffering, perhaps because of a wa r or a hurricane or some other natural disaster, some other terrible event, and they help people in those areas. They give them food, water, and so forth.

Michelle says, “If relief organizations didn’t have  enough blood when they travelled to disaster areas, they couldn’t help the  injured people there.” A “disaster (disaster) area” is an area where somethi ng very bad has happened – a war, a hurricane, an earthquake, that sort of thing . “To help injured people” means to help people who are hurt. “To be injured” (injured) means that you are hurt. You have some part of your body that has been  hurt or been damaged, maybe you broke your leg, maybe you’ve been cut – w hatever the injury is.

Michelle says, “I’m sure that’s why you do it, righ t?” She’s saying to Gabriel, I’m sure the reason you donate your blood is to help pe ople who need help, these relief organizations, for example. Gabriel says, “W ell…” Michelle says, “Well what?” He doesn’t seem to want to give the real ans wer and then he does. He says, “There is a particularly pretty nurse who wor ks in the bloodmobile.” Now,

we find out why Gabriel goes and donates his blood.  It’s not because he wants to be a good person. It’s because there’s an attractiv e, a physically attractive, good- looking nurse in the bloodmobile.

A “nurse” (nurse) is a professional who helps docto rs. Many nurses, most nurses, are female, in most countries. But there’re also, o f course, male nurses. But male nurses are the exception. In fact, typically, if yo u are a nurse who is male, we’ll often use the expression “male nurse” so that peopl e know that you’re not a woman. Of course, if they saw you, they probably kn ow you’re not a woman, but you know what I mean.

Well, Gabriel happens to like a pretty nurse who wo rks in the “bloodmobile.” The “bloodmobile” (bloodmobile) – one word – is a large  van or truck that travels around from place to place and inside of it. It has  equipment needed so that you can donate blood. “Bloodmobiles” are very popular i n the United States. They go to buildings or to big events and allow people to d onate blood so they don’t have to go to a hospital or to a doctor’s office. Michel le now understands why Gabriel wants to donate blood so often. He wants to go and talk to the pretty nurse. The question is, does the pretty nurse want to talk to Gabriel?

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Michelle:  Did you hurt yourself?

Gabriel:  No, why?

Michelle:  You have a Band-Aid on your arm.

Gabriel:  Oh, that. I donated blood today.

Michelle:  You did? That’s great. I’d like to donat e blood, but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed. I’m afraid if I go through with it, and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint.

Gabriel:  I’m used to it. I give blood all the time . The needle doesn’t bother me.

Michelle:  That’s very admirable. I know how import ant it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions.

Gabriel:  I don’t mind doing it. It’s not a big dea l.

 Michelle:  But it is a big deal. If relief organiza tions didn’t have enough blood when they traveled to disaster areas, they couldn’t  help the injured people there. I’m sure that’s why you do it, right?

Gabriel:  Well...

Michelle:  Well, what?

Gabriel:  There is a particularly pretty nurse who works in the bloodmobile...

Michelle:  Ah.

# Experiencing a Blackout

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 847: Experiencing a Blackout

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 847. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We have a website at eslpod.com. We have a Learning  Guide membership that you can get to support this podcast. Just go to our  website for more information.

This episode is a dialog between George and Inga ab out what happens when you don’t have any electrical power. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialog]

George:  Whoa, what happened?

Inga:  The lights went out. Did we blow a fuse, or is this a blackout?

George:  Well, I don’t see any lights on in any of the houses down the street. It’s pitch black out there.

Inga:  So it’s another power outage. Somehow the ci rcuits got overloaded again. I wonder how long we’ll have to do without electric ity this time.

George:  I wonder if it’s our power grid or if this  is a citywide blackout. All right, we’d better light a few candles. There’s no telling  how long this will last.

Inga:  No, it’s not like last summer when we had ro lling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat. Do you remember ho w we passed those hours of darkness?

George:  Yes, I do. What are you suggesting?

Inga:  I’m just saying that there’s no reason to wa ste a perfectly good blackout.

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with George saying, “Whoa. What h appened?” “Whoa,” usually spelled (whoa), is an expression of surprise. “What  happened?” George asks.

Inga says, “The lights went out,” meaning the elect ricity has stopped. There is no more electricity to the house or the building, or p erhaps, to the whole area where you’re living. Inga says, “Did we blow a fuse, or i s this a blackout?” “To blow (blow) a fuse (fuse)” means that you are using too much electricity at a certain part of your house. The “fuse” is something that pr otects your house, protects the things in your house if you try to get too much ele ctricity into a certain area.

Most houses nowadays don’t have fuses, which are li ttle devices, little things, little objects that you put into your electrical, w hat we call the “electrical panel” in the back of your house, wherever it is. Nowadays, t hey use things that are called “circuit breakers,” which are just basically switch es. “Fuses” are things that you actually have to take out and replace. In the house  I grew up in, many years ago, we had fuses. Now, the house I live in now has thes e new switches called “circuit breakers.”

Inga is asking if she and George have blown a fuse or if this is a “blackout.” A “blackout” (blackout) – one word – is when an entir e area, sometimes an entire city, loses power, loses electrical power. There is  no electricity available anywhere. “Blackout” could also be when you don’t r emember something after drinking a lot of alcohol. That’s also called a “bl ackout,” but here it means when you don’t have electrical power for a large area of  a city.

George says, “Well, I don’t see any lights on in an y of the houses down the street.” George goes out and looks to see if there’ s electricity in the other houses and he doesn’t see any. That means it’s probably a “blackout.” George says, “It’s pitch black out there.” The expression “pitch (pitc h) black” means extremely black, with no light whatsoever. Inga says, “So, it ’s another power outage.” A “power outage” (outage) is the same as a blackout. It’s a period of time when there is no electricity available.

Inga says, “Somehow, the circuits got overloaded ag ain.” A “circuit” (circuit) is a path that electricity follows between two points. I nga here is referring probably to the power plants – the place where the electricity is generated, that somehow their circuits got overloaded. “To be overloaded” m eans that there is too much demand, in this case, for electricity and the place  that is generating the electricity can’t produce it fast enough. And so, the circuits overload and nobody gets any power at all.

Inga says, “I wonder how long we’ll have to do with out electricity this time.” “To do without” means not to have. Electricity, you pro bably know, is power – energy that is carried through wires and cables, used to o perate almost everything that is in your house that’s a machine. Mostly, these are t hings that run on or are

powered by electricity. Except me -  I’m powered by  happiness! I’m powered by your emails, your positive feedback. That’s my powe r.

George says, “I wonder if it’s our power grid or if  this is a citywide blackout.” A “power grid” (grid) is a network of power companies  and users of electricity that are connected together. Power grids usually are ver y large. A “citywide blackout” would be a blackout that only affected one particul ar city - “citywide” (citywide) is one word, meaning across or covering an entire city .

George says, “All right, we’d better light a few ca ndles.” A “candle” (candle) is a small object, usually made of wax that has somethin g that you can light so that it burns. We call it a “wick” (wick). It’s basically a  piece of string that burns in the center of the wax and provides light. Many restaura nts have candles at night. It’s considered, perhaps, romantic. You may have candles  in your house. But George isn’t trying to be romantic here; at least, I don’t think he is. He instead, wants to get some candles so they have some light. George says, “There’s no telling how long this will last.” The expression “T here’s no telling” is used to mean that it’s impossible to know what will happen or wh en it will happen. There’s no telling how many beautiful women will be waiting for George Clooney or Brad Pitt to get their autographs, their signatures - there’s  no telling – could be hundreds, could be thousands, I don’t know.

Inga says, “No, it’s not like last summer when we h ad rolling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat.” A “rolling  (rolling) blackout” is when the power company decides to stop giving power to diffe rent areas. First one area, then another area, then another area, so that they’ re able to continue generating or producing enough power at least, for everyone for a certain amount of time, but not for everyone for the entire time. Instead o f just one part of the city not having power, they do a rolling blackout where they  give one part of the city power for four hours, let’s say, and another part o f the city power for four hours and so forth.

A “surge” (surge) is a sudden increase in something  that usually only lasts for a short time. Surge has a couple of different meaning s in English, however. Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ones  of those. Inga is saying that last summer there was surge in demand due to the he at. In other words, because it was so hot, more people were using the air condi tioners to keep themselves cool. This caused an increase in the demand for ele ctricity – a surge in the demand, and because of that sudden increase, the po wer company didn’t have enough power for all the different parts of the cit y. This happens occasionally. It happened in California, I remember, oh, maybe seven , ten years ago. It was

happening quite a bit, maybe longer. It hasn’t happ ened very recently here, but it still does happen in other cities.

Inga says, “Do you remember how we passed those hou rs of darkness?” She’s asking George if he remembers what they did last su mmer during the rolling blackouts, when they did not have electricity. That ’s what she means by “those hours of darkness” without light. George says, “Yes  I do. What are you suggesting?” Inga says, “I’m just saying that there ’s no reason to waste a perfectly a good blackout.” “Perfectly” here means completely. It’s a word used for emphasis here. It’s often used before the adjec tive “good.” “It’s a perfectly good sweater.” “It’s a perfectly good car.” You’re saying that there’s nothing wrong with it. Inga, however, is suggesting that sh e and her husband George can take advantage of this blackout, somehow - perhaps of course, in some romantic way.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

George:  Whoa, what happened?

Inga:  The lights went out. Did we blow a fuse, or is this a blackout?

George:  Well, I don’t see any lights on in any of the houses down the street. It’s pitch black out there.

Inga:  So it’s another power outage. Somehow the ci rcuits got overloaded again. I wonder how long we’ll have to do without electric ity this time.

George:  I wonder if it’s our power grid or if this  is a citywide blackout. All right, we’d better light a few candles. There’s no telling  how long this will last.

Inga:  No, it’s not like last summer when we had ro lling blackouts because of the surge in demand due to the heat. Do you remember ho w we passed those hours of darkness?

George:  Yes, I do. What are you suggesting?

Inga:  I’m just saying that there’s no reason to wa ste a perfectly good blackout.

[end of dialog]

There’s no telling how many more scripts our script writer will write in the future, but we hope that it will be, in fact, many more. Th ank you scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.

# An Unscrupulous Partner

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 848: An Unscrupulous Partner

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 848. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Join us on Facebook at f acebook.com/eslpod and follow us on Twitter at eslpod.

This episode is a story, not a dialog, about someon e who has a partner who is not very honest. Let’s get started. > My friend Charles convinced me to go into business with him about a year ago. I wish I had had the benefit of hindsight to say “no. ” I was too trusting and that was my downfall.
> At first, everything was fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground. But as soon as it looked like the business was going well, Charles turned on me. I had never been so deceived.
> We never signed a formal partnership agreement. Sin ce we were old friends, we relied on a verbal agreement that we would own the business 50-50. One day, out of the blue, Charles said that as the owner of the business, he had decided that my services were no longer needed. I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner and he couldn’t just fire me. He said that that was  never the agreement and he was the sole owner.
> And that is how I got cheated out of being co-owner  of a successful business. My old friend Charles turned out to be unscrupulous. F rom now on, I’ll be watching my back and looking out for my own interests. No on e will ever stab me in the back again!

Our story begins when I say, “My friend Charles con vinced me” – persuaded me – “to go into business with him about a year ago.” “To go into business with” means to work together, usually as co-owners of a b usiness. You both own the

business. “I wish I had had the benefit of hindsigh t to say ‘no.’” “The benefit (benefit) of something” is the advantage of somethi ng, something that can be helpful in some way. What would be helpful here is “hindsight” (hindsight). “Hindsight” is the ability to look back at what hap pened, to know about something that happened in the past, and really understand it . Of course, in the real world, we don’t have the opportunity to go into the future  and look back and that’s the origin of this expression. “The benefit of hindsigh t,” means if I had known then what I know now. We have another expression: “Hinds ight is 20-20.” “20-20” is when you have perfect vision, when your eyes are wo rking perfectly. Looking back at something, you can always understand and se e it clearly, but, of course, when you make a mistake, you don’t necessarily know  what’s going to happen in the future. And that’s what happened to me in the s tory.

I say, “I was too trusting and that was my downfall .” “To be trusting” means to believe that another person is telling you the trut h. You don’t demand any proof. You don’t ask for any evidence. You just say, “Oh, well, I can trust that person. He’s a truthful person.” I say that “I was too trus ting and that” – being too trusting – “was my downfall.” A “downfall” – one word – is a  reason why something fails. It’s the source of a problem, the reason why someth ing goes bad.

“At first” – at the beginning – I say “everything w as fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground.” “To work your butt (butt) off” is an informal expression meaning to work very hard. You’re workin g so hard, you can’t work anymore. You’re very tired because you’re working s o hard. “To get a business off the ground” – to get anything off the ground – means to get it started, to, in this case, start a business and make it successful.  “As soon as it looked like the business was going well, however, Charles turned on  me.” “To turn on someone” means to suddenly change your relationship or your attitude towards another person so that you begin to attack that other perso n. You begin to become mean or aggressive toward that person. That’s “to turn o n someone” – to suddenly, after being perhaps, being friends with someone, be come their enemy. The expression “turn on” actually has a couple of diffe rent meanings. Some of those are in our Learning Guide.

So, Charles and I started this business. It became successful and then Charles changed – he turned on me. I say that, “I had never  been so deceived.” “To deceive” (deceive) means to lie to someone, not to be honest with someone. We also have the expression “to trick (trick) someone. ” That’s to deceive them, to get them to believe something that isn’t true, usually,  so that you have some sort of benefit, something good happens to you by lying to them.

I continue the story by saying that “Charles and I never signed a formal partnership agreement.” The word “formal” here just  means official – on a piece of paper, typically. An “agreement” is when two peo ple sign something, basically like a contract. It’s a formal legal document. “Par tnership” refers to two people working together. So, when you have a business in t he United States, it’s possible to form a legal partnership where the two of you sign an agreement, a piece of paper saying that you will work together a nd that you will split the company. You will divide the company in a certain w ay.

I say that Charles and I, since we were old friends , because we had been friends for many years, “relied on a verbal agreement.” “Ve rbal” (verbal) means the same as spoken, not written down, not written on a piece of paper. A “verbal agreement” is, of course, very difficult to try to do something with in the future since you could say, “Oh, I didn’t say that.” If yo u have a written document, you can actually look at the piece of paper and see wha t it says. The verbal agreement that Charles and I had was that we would own the business 50-50. “50-50” means 50% for him, 50% for me. We might als o say “half and half.” We each own half of the business.

“One day,” I say, “out of the blue,” meaning unexpe ctedly and very suddenly, “Charles said that as the owner of the business, he  had decided that my services were no longer needed.” In other words, Charles sai d that he was the owner of the business and that he no longer wanted me to wor k in the business. “I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner.” “Co- (co) owner” is someone who owns the business with you. This prefix “co-” is used when t wo people are working together, or two people have the same interest or t he equal amount of interest in something. For example, we could talk about “co-wor kers.” These are people who work together. We could also talk about “co-aut hors” – two people who write a book together. That’s the prefix “co-” and how it ’s used.

“I said that I was co-owner and Charles couldn’t ju st fire me.” He said – Charles – that “That was never the agreement and that he was the sole owner.” “Sole” (sole) means only. In this case, single, without an yone else. He’s the only owner. He said that he was the sole owner. “And that is ho w,” I say, “I got cheated out of being co-owner of a successful business.” “To get c heated” (cheated) out of something means that you are tricked so that you do  not get what you are supposed to get. You are deceived in such a way tha t typically, you lose money or you lose something of value.

“My old friend Charles, turned out to be unscrupulo us,” I say. “To be scrupulous” (scrupulous) can mean to be very careful about some thing. It could also mean to be too careful, to be too worried about things. But  to be “unscrupulous” means to

not be careful. But really, we use it to mean disho nest. “To be unscrupulous” means not to worry about what’s right or wrong, jus t to do things that are good for you. I say, “From now on” – from this point forward  – “I’ll be watching my back.” “To watch your back means to protect yourself again st other people, to be looking for dangers that other people might present  to you.

I also say, “I will be looking out for my own inter ests.” “To look out for your own interests” means to do what is most beneficial to y ou, without caring about what happens to other people. Of course, that’s not a ve ry good way to react to this situation, but that’s how I reacted in the story. I  decide I’ll be looking out for my own interests. I won’t care about what happens to a nyone else, just about what happens to me. I say, “No one will ever stab me in the back again.” “To stab” (stab) means to take a knife or a very sharp object  and put it into someone’s body. “To stab someone in the back” means to hurt s omeone, to deceive someone in such a way that they didn’t see it comin g. They didn’t realize what you were doing and suddenly they did. It doesn’t me an to actually kill someone with a knife, although it could. But it means, more  commonly, to be deceived or cheated by another person, especially a person that  you had trusted, and therefore didn’t expect to deceive you.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of story]

My friend Charles convinced me to go into business with him about a year ago. I wish I had had the benefit of hindsight to say “no. ” I was too trusting and that was my downfall.

At first, everything was fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground. But as soon as it looked like the business was going well, Charles turned on me. I had never been so deceived.

We never signed a formal partnership agreement. Sin ce we were old friends, we relied on a verbal agreement that we would own the business 50-50. One day, out of the blue, Charles said that as the owner of the business, he had decided that my services were no longer needed. I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner and he couldn’t just fire me. He said that that was  never the agreement and he was the sole owner.

And that is how I got cheated out of being co-owner  of a successful business. My old friend Charles turned out to be unscrupulous. F rom now on, I’ll be watching

my back and looking out for my own interests. No on e will ever stab me in the back again!

# Bargaining With Store Owners

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 849: Bargaining with Store Owners

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 849. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there, become a membe r, and support this podcast.

This episode is a dialog between Connie and Ivan ab out bargaining, trying to get a good price, at a store. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Connie:  You speak McQuillanese. Ask the store owne r the price of this vase.

Ivan:  All right. He says it’s $60.

Connie: That’s actually a great price, but let’s se e if I can talk him down a little. You should never accept the starting price and the prices in these stores are all negotiable. Ask him what his rock bottom price is f or the vase.

Ivan:  He said that he’ll take $50, but not one pen ny less.

Connie:  The vase is really a steal at $50, but may be he’s still willing to bargain. Tell him that I won’t pay a penny more than $40.

Ivan:  I told him and he says that at that price, h e’d be giving it away. I don’t think he’s going to budge. I think you should just buy it . He doesn’t look like he’s willing to haggle with you.

Connie:  Don’t be impatient. Good things come to th ose who wait. Tell him that I’m ready to walk away if he doesn’t take $42 for i t. Hey, where’s he going?

Ivan:  He says that he’s walking away because he do esn’t sell to cheap Americans.

Connie:  Hmph!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Connie saying to Ivan, “You speak McQuillanese.” “McQuillanese,” like “McQuish,” is a very rare lang uage. Actually, the ending -ese is used in a couple of different ways. It can be us ed to describe a language, for example, Japanese, or Chinese – those are languages  spoken in Japan and China, respectively. We also use that suffix -ese a t the end when we are talking about the particular kind of language, for example,  for a certain type of work or for a certain purpose. We used to talk about in lin guistics something called “motherese,” which is the kind of language that a m other uses with her child. I think they call it “caretakerese,” nowadays. But the idea is that the -ese usually indicates, or often indicates, that we’re talking a bout a language. And here, we’re talking about McQuillanese as a language. Ivan spea ks McQuillanese.

So Connie says, “Ask the storeowner the price of th is vase.” A “vase” (vase) is a ceramic or glass object, usually used for putting f lowers into. Ivan says, “All right.” And then, I guess, he speaks McQuillanese t o the storeowner. Then he says to Connie, “He says it’s $60.” Connie says, “T hat’s actually a great price” – a very good price – “but let’s see if I can talk hi m down a little.” “To talk someone down” means to get someone to agree to a lower pric e than he has offered you, to get someone to lower the price on something they ’re selling. That’s “to talk someone down.” “The buyer talked down the seller $5 0 – he talked him down.”

Connie says, “You should never accept the starting price.” The “starting price” is the price that the seller tells you first. “It’s a hundred dollars,” and you say, “Oh, no. A hundred dollars? No, no, no. How about $50?” The starting price there would be a hundred dollars, what the seller tells y ou initially, at first. Connie says, “You should never accept the starting price and the  prices in these stores are all negotiable.” “Negotiable” (negotiable) means that t hey can be changed. When you go into a typical American store, especially a large store such as a department store that sells clothing and furniture,  usually the prices are not negotiable. You can’t take a shirt and go up and ta lk to one of the employees at the store and say, “I’ll give you $10 for this shir t,” even though the price is $15.

However, in many countries, and in smaller stores p erhaps in the U.S, prices are negotiable, and you can say, “Well, that’s too high ,” and then you give a different price. Connie says, “Ask him what his rock bottom p rice is for the vase.” “Rock bottom price” is the lowest possible price you will  accept, the least amount of money. This, of course, is a strategy, a technique in bargaining, in trying to get a low price for something. You try to get the other p erson to give you the lowest possible price that he is willing to give you, and so you may ask for his “rock

bottom price,” although, usually, that’s only somet hing you might ask for after you’ve already negotiated a little bit back and for th.

Ivan says, “He said he’ll take $50 but not one penn y less.” The expression “not one penny (penny) less” means that this is the abso lute minimum or lowest price, that the person is not going to lower the price any more beyond that point. A “penny” is one cent, one American cent. One dollar is a hundred cents, or a hundred pennies equals one dollar. Connie says, “Th e vase is a real steal at $50.” A “steal” (steal) here means a very good deal , something that is sold at a very low price, something expensive sold very cheap ly. “Steal” has some other meanings in English, however. Make sure you look at  the Learning Guide for those. You don’t want to use the wrong meaning of s teal. Here “steal” means a very good bargain.

Connie says, “Maybe he’s still willing to bargain”  - “he’s still willing” meaning even though he said that is his lowest price, maybe  he’ll go a little lower. “To bargain,” as we said before, means to negotiate, me ans to get a lower price by talking to someone. Then Connie says, “Tell him” – the seller – “that I won’t pay a penny more than $40.” So, the seller said he wouldn ’t accept anything lower than $50. “Not one penny less,” he said. Connie is now s aying that she won’t pay a penny more than $40, meaning $40 is the maximum, the most she will pay.

Ivan then, of course, talks to the store owner in M cQuillanese. We don’t get to hear that part. He says, “I told him and he says th at at that price, he’d be giving it away. “At that price” – meaning at $40 – “he would be giving it away.” Of course, to give something away is a phrasal verb, meaning t o give something for free. You’re not even asking for any money for it. Of cou rse, the shop owner is not giving it away, but he’s using that expression to s ay that he can’t possibly sell this vase at $40. It’s too cheap. He won’t make any mone y. Ivan says “I don’t think he’s going to budge.” “To budge” (budge) means to m ove a small amount or to change your position. If someone says, “Well, this is my price and I’m not going to budge,” here he means that they’re not going to change their position. They’re not going to change the price.

Ivan says, “I think you should just buy it. He does n’t look like he’s willing to haggle with you.” “To haggle” (haggle) or “to haggl e” – same word – my pronunciation is a little different – means to nego tiate, to bargain, to try to get a lower price. So, it’s the same as to bargain. Conni e says, “Don’t be impatient. Good things come to those who wait.” This is an old  expression, “Good things come to those who wait” – if you wait enough, if yo u wait a long time, eventually you will have some good things coming to you. The i dea is that even though

there are difficulties in waiting, it may not be ve ry pleasant. When you wait, you get good things after that waiting period.

Connie says, “Tell him that I’m ready to walk away if he doesn’t take $42 for it.” “To walk away” means, in this case, to end the disc ussion, to stop the negotiation, to say, “Okay, I’m not going to buy it  all. Goodbye.” Connie says, “Hey, where’s he going?” Where is he going? Ivan sa ys, “He” – the storeowner – “says that he’s walking away because he doesn’t sel l to cheap Americans.” “Cheap” (cheap) is a low price. But here it’s used as an insult. It means someone who doesn’t want to pay very much money for anythin g even though that thing is worth the money. Someone who is cheap is someone wh o doesn’t like to spend money and will often sacrifice rather than spend mo re money, will often say, “Okay, I’m not going to do anything because I don’t  want to spend any money.”

It’s usually an insulting term to call someone “che ap.” If you ask a girl out on a date, and then at the end of the date you say, “Oh,  why don’t we each pay our own bill,” if you’re a man, the girl might think yo u are cheap. And she’d probably be right.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Connie:  You speak McQuillanese. Ask the store owne r the price of this vase.

Ivan:  All right. He says it’s $60.

Connie: That’s actually a great price, but let’s se e if I can talk him down a little. You should never accept the starting price and the prices in these stores are all negotiable. Ask him what his rock bottom price is f or the vase.

Ivan:  He said that he’ll take $50, but not one pen ny less.

Connie:  The vase is really a steal at $50, but may be he’s still willing to bargain. Tell him that I won’t pay a penny more than $40.

Ivan:  I told him and he says that at that price, h e’d be giving it away. I don’t think he’s going to budge. I think you should just buy it . He doesn’t look like he’s willing to haggle with you.

Connie:  Don’t be impatient. Good things come to th ose who wait. Tell him that I’m ready to walk away if he doesn’t take $42 for i t. Hey, where’s he going?

 Ivan:  He says that he’s walking away because he do esn’t sell to cheap Americans.

Connie:  Hmph!

# Betting on Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 850: Betting on Sports

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 850. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Peter and Angela a bout betting – trying to win money by betting on sports. Let’s get started. > Peter:  Look at this! I just won 2,000 smackaroos!
> Angela:  Where did you get all that money?
> Peter:  I won it betting on the game last night. I placed a small wager with high odds and won big.
> Angela:  Wow, I always put money in the pools at wo rk, but I’ve never won anything like $2,000.
> Peter:  I’ll introduce you to my bookie if you want  to do some serious betting. But I warn you: he only deals in high-stakes wagers, no t penny ante bets.
> Angela:  You bet through a bookie? You must do some  serious gambling. I don’t think that’s for me.
> Peter:  You can’t win big if you don’t play big. I’ ve just placed a bet on this weekend’s game.
> Angela:  But the Minnesota McQ’s are the favorites by a wide margin.
> Peter:  There’s a 10-point point spread. Come on, w hat do you say? Are you in or out? I’ve just put $500 on it.
> Our dialog begins with Peter saying to Angela, “Loo k at this! I just won 2,000 smackaroos!” “Smackaroos” (smackaroos) is an inform al term, meaning dollars. It’s a little old. You don’t hear it that much anym ore. It was much more popular in the 20 th , mid 20 th  century, let’s say. But you’ll still hear someone say, “That cost 400 smackaroos” – 400 bucks, 400 dollars. Peter say s he just won 2,000 smackaroos. Angela says, “Where did you get all tha t money?” Peter says, “I won it betting on the game last night.” “To bet” (b et) is to try to win money by guessing how something is going to turn out in the future, who’s going to win the game, who’s going to win the election, which horse is going to race the fastest. Betting is guessing with your money, and if you’re right, of course, you get money back. If you’re wrong, you lose your money. That’s the whole idea.

We have betting legally in the state of Nevada, whi ch is next to California. We have betting in other cities and other places. Most  states, actually, probably have some form of betting. It may be the government spon soring the betting. It may be Native American or American Indian tribes, but bett ing is fairly common now in the U.S., at least, more common than it was forty y ears ago.

Peter says that he won the money betting on a game last night. “I placed a small wager with high odds and won big.” A “wager” (wager ) is the amount of money that you bet. Don’t confuse this with the word “wag e” (wage) which is the money you get for working. Many people get a wage and the n take their wages and they make wagers. Well, Peter made or placed a wager (ei ther verb is correct) with “high odds.” “High odds” means that the probability  or likelihood of something happening was very small. It’s a little confusing. If you say, this has high odds, we mean that if you win, you’ll win a lot of money back, but it’s not very likely that you will win. This is often expressed by using expr essions like “ten to one,” or “five to one.” You bet a dollar and if you win, you  get five dollars back. If it’s ten to one and you bet one dollar, you get ten dollars bac k. But ten to one might be considered high odds, meaning not very likely to ha ppen.

Well, Peter won by placing a small wager on somethi ng with high odds and he won big. He won a lot of money. Angela says, “Wow. I always put money in the pools at work, but I’ve never won anything like $2, 000.” The “pools” (pools) refers to betting pools. A “betting pool” is when everybod y puts in a small amount of money and you, for example, are trying to guess who ’s going to win a tournament where you have, let’s say, eight teams, eight baseball teams, or more likely, eight football teams playing in this t ournament, and eventually there’ll

be only one winner. You might have a pool where you  bet on a certain team and then when that team wins, everyone who bet on that team, who said that team was going to win, gets part of the money.

There aren’t any odds in betting pools. It’s not li ke ten to one or five to one. It just depends on how many people bet. The more people who  bet and the fewer people who bet on the winner, the more money those people will get. “Pools” sometimes are arranged so that there’s only one pos sibility. For some reason, in some offices in the U.S., it’s popular to have a po ol for the time that a baby will be born to someone who works in the office, and the  person who’s closest to the day and time wins the pool. There, there will proba bly be only one winner, but betting pools can have more than one winner.

Angela says she’s never won anything like $2,000, m eaning anything that she has won has been much less. Peter says, “I’ll intro duce you to my bookie if you want to do some serious betting.” “I’ll introduce y ou” – I will take you to this person, in this case, the “bookie.” A “bookie” (boo kie) is someone whose job it is to take money for people’s bets. “Bookies” usually are working illegally, at least, that’s the general use of the term. If somebody say s they have a “bookie,” usually it’s someone who is running these pools or taking b ets on games that are not legally sanctioned, that are not allowed by the gov ernment, but because it’s so common, it’s very difficult for the government to t ry to stop this sort of thing. Peter has a bookie, which usually means the person is a r ather serious gambler.

He says, “I’ll introduce you to my bookie if you wa nt to do some serious betting.” “Serious” here would mean significant, a lot. “But I warn you, he only deals in high-stakes wagers, not penny ante bets.” “High-sta kes” means a lot of money with, usually, a lot of risk involved. “Penny ante”  would be a very small amount of money. It’s a type of gambling where people wouldn’ t bet more than a dollar or two dollars, maybe five dollars. “High-stakes gambl ing” would be hundreds of dollars or, perhaps, even thousands of dollars that  you’re betting.

Angela says, “You bet through a bookie?” She’s a li ttle surprised because, as I mentioned, if you work with a bookie, if you have a  bookie for your bets, you’re probably a pretty serious better. “You must do some  serious gambling.” Notice the use of the word “serious” again. It means a lot  or a lot of money involved. “Gambling” is when you place bets on some future ev ent. “Gambling” and “betting” are basically the same thing. “Betting” a nd “gambling” usually deal with money, but you could bet or gamble on things that d id not involve money directly.

Angela says, “I don’t think that’s for me.” Peter s ays, “You can’t win big if you don’t play big.” What he means here is you can’t wi n a lot of money unless you

bet a lot of money. “I’ve just placed a bet on this  weekend’s game.” In many American offices, certainly in the offices that I’v e worked in, it’s not unusual, especially during American football season, for the re to be people betting on the football games of that weekend. Often you go throug h and you pick the winners of all of the games, however many there are – a doz en, two dozen, I don’t know. I don’t watch American football, but you bet on the  winner, and the person who gets the most winners wins the money. That’s a pret ty common practice in a lot of businesses and a lot of offices.

Peter says he’s just placed a bet on this weekend’s  game. We don’t know if it’s a basketball game or a football game or what it is. A ngela says, “But the Minnesota McQ’s are the favorite by a wide margin.” The Minne sota McQ’s is one of the best, of course, sports teams in whatever sport the y play. Angela says the Minnesota McQ’s are the “favorites” by a “wide marg in.” “To be the favorites” means to be the person or the team that is expected  to win this game. A “wide margin” means by a very large amount, or significan t amount. In other words, the Minnesota McQ’s are expected to win.

Peter says, “There’s a 10-point point spread.” We m ight more commonly just say a “ten point spread.” A “point spread” is a predict ion about the differences in the final scores of the games. So, for a specific game,  let’s say you have one very good team playing one not very good team in basketb all. There might be a 20 point spread, meaning the team that’s good has to w in by 20 points if you bet on them to win. If they don’t, even though they win the game, if they win it by less than 20 points, you don’t win the bet.

Peter says, “C’mon, what do you say?” “What do you say” is an informal phrase used to ask someone’s opinion or to ask for their d ecision when you’re trying to persuade them to do something. He says, “Are you in  or out?” meaning are you going to bet or not? “I’ve just put $500 on it.” An gela says, “That’s too rich for my blood.” The expression “to be too rich for your blo od” means it’s too expensive for you. It’s too much money.

She says, “I think I’ll stick to the minor leagues. ” “I think I’ll stick to” means I think I will continue, in this case, betting on things th at are less expensive or less important. In American baseball, we have the minor leagues and the major leagues. The minor leagues are the teams where the players aren’t as good and don’t get paid as much. The major leagues are the l arge teams where the players get millions of dollars. The Los Angeles Dodgers, f or example, is a major league baseball team, but the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes is a  minor league team that no one has ever heard of.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Peter:  Look at this! I just won 2,000 smackaroos!

Angela:  Where did you get all that money?

Peter:  I won it betting on the game last night. I placed a small wager with high odds and won big.

Angela:  Wow, I always put money in the pools at wo rk, but I’ve never won anything like $2,000.

Peter:  I’ll introduce you to my bookie if you want  to do some serious betting. But I warn you: he only deals in high-stakes wagers, no t penny ante bets.

Angela:  You bet through a bookie? You must do some  serious gambling. I don’t think that’s for me.

Peter:  You can’t win big if you don’t play big. I’ ve just placed a bet on this weekend’s game.

Angela:  But the Minnesota McQ’s are the favorites by a wide margin.

Peter:  There’s a 10-point point spread. Come on, w hat do you say? Are you in or out? I’ve just put $500 on it.

Angela:  That’s too rich for my blood. I think I’ll  stick to the minor leagues.

# Finding a House to Buy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 851: Finding a House to Buy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 851. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, right here in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there and download a Learning Guide for this episode. You can also take a look at some of our sp ecial courses in business and daily English that we have available right ther e on the website.

This episode is a story about someone who’s trying to find a house to buy. Let’s get started. > I’m looking to buy a house and I want a single-fami ly home. I have been living in a townhouse for two years, and I am tired of having  common walls and very small yards. My new house will have to have a lot m ore square footage, a large lot size, an open floor plan, great curb appeal, an d lots of upgrades.
> My agent has been showing me fixer-uppers, while I want a home that’s in move- in condition. The problem is, I can’t afford a high  mortgage. I’m not holding out for a mansion, but I want this new house to be a step u p from my townhouse.
> My real estate agent tells me that I have to adjust  my expectations. I asked him, “Do you mean I can’t have the house I want?” And he  said, “Of course you can. All you have to do is move – to Alaska!”

Our story begins when I say that “I’m looking to bu y a house and I want a single- family home.” When someone says they are trying to buy a house, it isn’t always necessarily a physical house versus a condominium o r a townhouse. We’ll talk about what they are in a minute. A “single-family h ome” is a home designed for just one family to live in, in a single building. I t’s the traditional house. When someone says “I have a house,” we think of a buildi ng being on its own. The only people in that little building, that house, are the  people who live there.

This is different from a condominium. A “condominiu m” is when you have, basically, what are apartments that people buy and own. You could also have a “townhouse.” A “townhouse” – one word – is a tall, narrow home, usually with two or three levels, two or three floors, but it’s buil t right next to another townhouse. So, it’s not like a single family home where the bu ilding is separate from anything around it. In a townhouse, usually, they’re all in one building so that even though you have your own space, your own area, there’s som eone right next to you who has, typically, what are called “common walls.” “Co mmon walls” are when two different apartments, or two different townhouses o r two different condominiums have one person on one side of the wall and the oth er person on the other side of the wall, that’s a common wall.

Well, I say in my story that “I have been living in  a townhouse for two years and I’m tired of having common walls.” “I’m tired of th is” means I don’t want to live this way anymore. I don’t like this situation. I’m tired  of having common walls, walls that I share with other people. Of course, when you  have a townhouse or a condominium or an apartment building, it’s usually a little noisier because you can hear the people next to you more easily because  you have a common wall.

I also say that I don’t like the very small yards t hat come with the townhouse. A “yard” (yard) is an outside area next to a home. Ma ny homes have a yard in front of the house, the front yard, and then they have a yard in the back of the house, the backyard. Typical American homes have grass som ewhere on the yard or in the yard. My house has grass in the front yard and grass in the backyard. That’s my real house, not the house in the story here, nec essarily.

Let’s go back to the story. I say that “My new hous e will have to have a lot more square footage.” “Square footage” (footage) is the number of square feet in an area. It’s how we measure the size of houses or the  size of apartment buildings or apartments within the building, more likely. The  same is true for townhouses and condominiums. You might buy a house that has a thousand square feet. That means that there are 1,000 square feet inside of the house. Most American homes used to be built with, say, 1500 – 1700 squar e feet. That would be a typical three-bedroom, two-bath home (that is a hom e with three bedrooms and two bathrooms). Nowadays, in the last, oh, I don’t know, 25, 30 years, houses are being built to be much bigger, so that you have  2,000 or 2500 or 3,000 square feet.

In the story, I say “I want a lot more square foota ge,” meaning a bigger house, “a large lot size, an open floor plan, great curb appe al, and lots of upgrades.” “A lot” (lot) is the land that the house sits on. “Lot size ” would be the size of that piece of land. Typically, here, in my neighborhood in Los An geles, lot sizes are between

,000 and 7,000 square feet, and then on those lots , on those pieces of land are houses that have between a thousand and 3,000 squar e feet inside of the house.

An “open floor plan” is a design of a home. It coul d be an office also that has a lot of open space. There aren’t that many walls. The fl oor plan is technically like a drawing of where things are in your house, almost l ike a map. When we use the expression “open floor plan,” we’re referring to a place that doesn’t have a lot of walls, where there’s a lot of light passing through  one room to the next.

I also want, in the story, a house with “great curb  appeal.” “Curb appeal” (curb appeal) – two words – refers to how attractive, how  good-looking the house looks when you’re driving by it or when you’re walking do wn the street. A “curb” is where the street meets your property. Usually, the street is a little bit lower, maybe a half a foot lower than the land where the h ouses are. “Appeal” refers to how attractive something is. We have, also, the adj ective “appealing.” “Curb appeal” refers to the attractiveness of your house.  Does it look good from the outside?

“Upgrades” (upgrades) refer to when a house has new  things done to it. When an old house has a new bathroom or a new kitchen, thos e would be upgrades. “Upgrades” could also refer to some things you woul dn’t normally expect in an average house, a typical house. Maybe there’s a ver y big tub. A big tub might be considered an upgrade. It’s nicer. It’s more expens ive and so forth.

I say in the story that “My agent,” meaning the per son who’s helping me buy the house – my real estate agent – “has been showing me  fixer-uppers.” A “fixer- upper” (fixer-upper) is a house that needs work. It ’s a house that has problems that you’re going to have to come in and fix. I say  that “My agent has been showing me fixer-uppers while I want a home that’s in move-in condition.” “Move- in condition” is when you can come in and you can j ust live in the house. You don’t have to fix anything. Everything is working. That’s move-in condition. Usually, having to paint the walls is not considere d something that would make a house a fixer-upper. Wall painting or changing the carpet – those things are to be expected, and you could still call a house in move- in condition even though you had to paint the walls.

In the story, I say that “My problem is I can’t aff ord a high mortgage.” A “mortgage” (mortgage) – the “t” is silent – is a lo an that you use to buy a house. I say, “I’m not holding out for a mansion, but I want  this new house to be a step up from my townhouse.” “To hold out for something” mea ns to wait for something that you really want. “I’m not holding out,” “I’m n ot waiting to get a mansion,” I

say. A “mansion” (mansion) is a huge house, a very large, expensive house. People in Beverly Hills, rich people, live in mansi ons.

“I want this house to be a step up from my townhous e,” I say. A “step-up from” simply means an improvement over, something that is  better than what you used to have. If you own a Honda Civic, which is a very nice car – I used to own one – and then you buy a Porsche or a Lexus, those would be a step up from your Honda Civic – more expensive cars.

I end the story by saying that “My real estate agen t tells me that I have to adjust,” or change, “my expectations.” “Expectations” are the things you believe will happen, that you want to happen about a situation, what you anticipate to happen. Here, it really just means how good of a ho use I can get for the money that I have.

I asked him, “Do you mean I can’t have the house I want?” And he said, “Of course you can. All you have to do is move - to Ala ska!” My real estate agent is saying that with the money that I have, if I want t he kind of house that I want – a big house – I’m going to have to go to somewhere wh ere houses are very cheap. In the story here, my real estate agent says “to Al aska,” not because Alaska is the cheapest place to live in the United States, bu t because it’s far, far away. It’s a long distance from where most of us live here, wh at we call the “continental United States,” the part of the United States betwe en Canada and Mexico.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, or rather the story , this time at a normal speed. > I’m looking to buy a house and I want a single-fami ly home. I have been living in a townhouse for two years, and I am tired of having  common walls and very small yards. My new house will have to have a lot m ore square footage, a large lot size, an open floor plan, great curb appeal, an d lots of upgrades.
> My agent has been showing me fixer-uppers, while I want a home that’s in move- in condition. The problem is, I can’t afford a high  mortgage. I’m not holding out for a mansion, but I want this new house to be a step u p from my townhouse.
> My real estate agent tells me that I have to adjust  my expectations. I asked him, “Do you mean I can’t have the house I want?” And he  said, “Of course you can. All you have to do is move – to Alaska!”

# Working in a Factory

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 852: Working in a Factory

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 852. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com. Go there and take a look  at our ESL Podcast Store with a lot of wonderful courses for you. You can al so take a look at our ESL Podcast blog.

This episode is a dialog between Tony and Amber abo ut working in a factory – a place where things are made or manufactured. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Tony:  The plant manager says that you’re the new k id.

Amber:  Yes, it’s my first day.

Tony:  All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us. Here’s your workstation. What you have to remember is that output and produc tivity are the most important things around here.

Amber:  I understand, but...

Tony:  Watch out for that forklift! You have to wat ch where you’re going or you’ll ruin our safety record.

Amber:  Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery? I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything .

Tony:  I’m going to teach you, so pay attention. the other thing you have to worry about around here is quality control. If you don’t do things right, you’ll hear about it.

Amber:  Okay, but...

Tony:  Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re n ot careful, you’ll get your head taken off in this factory. Now, try to pay attentio n.

 Amber:  I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my lif e is in danger every other minute.

Tony:  [sighs] Rookies!

[end of dialog]

Tony begins our dialog by saying to Amber, “The pla nt manager says that you’re the new kid.” A “plant (plant) manager (manager)” i s the most important supervisor in a factory, the most important boss. “ Plant” here refers to a place where things are made. A factory, which is in the t itle of our episode, is also a place where things are made. The two words mean the  same, “factory” or “plant.” When I say, “things are made,” I mean, typically, p hysical things – chairs or cars or doors. We’re not talking about computer software , for example, but the actual computers, the physical machines would be made in a  plant or in a factory. Tony refers to the “plant manager,” calling Amber the “n ew kid,” meaning the new employee, in this case. It doesn’t mean that she’s actually a child.

Amber says, “Yes, it’s my first day.” Tony says, “A ll right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us.” A “line (line) worker” is a p erson who has a “low level job,” we would call it, not a very important or complicated job – usually, working on what’s called an “assembly line.” An “assembly line” is wh en you are making some product, some thing, and everyone does something in  order. Often, you’re all standing next to each other. So, I may put in the f irst screw and I give it to you, and you put in a bolt, and then you give it to anot her person and they put a cover on, and then they give it to someone else, and you’ re doing the same thing over and over again all day. That’s being a line worker.

Tony says to Amber, “Here’s your workstation.” Your  “workstation” is the place, of course, where you work. It’s usually a small area, maybe a desk, but not a complete office, not an entire office of your own. In a factory, your workstation might just be a very small table, for example.

“What you have to remember,” Tony says, “is that ou tput and productivity are the most important things around here.” “Output” (outpu t) is what a person or a machine produces – what they make. A big factory ma y make thousands of telephones, cellular telephones, mobile phones, eve ryday or even every hour. That would be their output. “Productivity” refers t o how much work you get done in a certain amount of time. When productivity incr eases, workers are able to produce more with the same amount of time. So, inst ead of producing a thousand cell phones a day, the same amount of work ers with the same amount

of time, produce ten thousand new cell phones. This  is an increase in productivity, either because the workers are workin g harder or because the technology allows to be more productive, to have a higher output. Notice I use “high” or “low” for output. For productivity, we ta lk about it “rising” or “falling.”

Amber says, “I understand but…” Tony interrupts her  and says, “Watch out for that forklift!” “Watch out” means “be careful.” A “ forklift” (forklift) is a machine with a large, strong piece of metal in the front of it. Typically there’re like two bars, and they go underneath heavy objects and are able to li ft them up and take them from one place to another. So, if you have a heavy box, you might have a forklift come, and it puts these two bars – flat bars – unde rneath it, and it looks kind of like a fork. So, that’s why it’s called a “forklift .” Then it is able to lift it up and move it to another location.

Tony says, “You have to watch where you’re going or  you’ll ruin our safety record.” “Safety” is the opposite of having acciden ts. “Safety” refers to people not getting hurt, not getting injured, not getting kill ed. The “safety record of the factory,” or the plant, refers to how many people a re injured in the factory every year, and many times, there are injuries. There are  people who get hurt in factories or in plants.

Amber says, “Sorry. When will I get trained to use this machinery?” “Machinery” (machinery) are large pieces of equipment typically  operated by electricity or some other power source. “Machinery” usually refers  to a piece of equipment that makes something else, although not always.

Amber says, “I’ve never worked on an assembly line before to mass-produce anything.” An “assembly (assembly) line” is, as we referred to earlier, the process where you have many people working to build or crea te something, and each person does the same thing over and over again. I d o one thing, then you do something, then the next person does something else . An “assembly line” can also have machines instead of people, and many of t hem do nowadays. “Assembly” comes from the verb “to assemble” (assem ble) which means to put something together.

Amber says that she’s never worked on an assembly l ine before, “to mass- produce anything.” “To produce” means to make. “To mass- (mass) produce” means to make a large amount of things, especially things that are identical. They’re not made for an individual person. You make  the same thing over and over again. Tony says, “I’m going to teach you, so pay attention,” meaning focus on what I’m saying.

“The other thing you have to worry about around her e is quality control.” “Quality” is how good or bad something is. “Control” is makin g sure something is the way it’s supposed to be. So, “quality control” is testi ng the products, testing the things that are made to make sure that they were made corr ectly.

“If you don’t do things right,” Tony says, “you’ll hear about it.” This expression “you’ll hear about it,” means, usually, that you’ve  done something wrong and that you are being told about it and probably will be pu nished for it. So, a child might be told by his parent, “If you cause any problems o n the playground today, you’ll hear about it,” meaning I’m going to talk to you ab out it and it’s not going to be good news.

Amber says, “Okay but…” Tony again interrupts her a nd says, “Hey, sit down! As I said before, if you’re not careful, you’ll get yo ur head taken off in this factory.” “To be taken off” means to be removed or separated.  Tony is telling Amber to be careful. She apparently started to stand up and per haps another machine was moving past her. The factory, of course, is the pla nt, the building where things are made. Tony says, “Now, try to pay attention.” A mber says, “I’m trying, but it’s hard to do when my life is in danger every other mi nute.” “Every other minute” means often, very often, very frequently.

Tony is not very happy with Amber. He sighs. He goe s “(sighs) Rookies!” A “rookie” (rookie) is someone who is new to a job or  new to an organization, someone who doesn’t have very much experience. We u sually use this term in talking about sports, somebody who is new to the pr ofessional teams or the professional leagues. A baseball player from colleg e, who then starts playing for one of the professional baseball teams like the Los  Angeles Dodgers, that person would be called a “rookie” during their first year.  They’re new. The term more generally means anyone who’s new to doing something ; usually, someone with less experience.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Tony:  The plant manager says that you’re the new k id.

Amber:  Yes, it’s my first day.

Tony:  All right, you’ll be a line worker like the rest of us. Here’s your workstation. What you have to remember is that output and produc tivity are the most important things around here.

# Reading an Obituary

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 853: Reading an Obituary

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 853. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. How are you toda y? Oh, me? Pretty good, thanks for asking.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide, and you can find that guide at ESLPod.com.

This is a dialog between Ivy and Stephan about read ing an obituary, a notice in the newspaper or on the Internet about someone who’ s died. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ivy:  This is so sad!

Stephan:  What is?

Ivy:  I’m reading the obituary for one of my favori te actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.

Stephan:  Oh, yeah?

Ivy:  Yeah, and this article has really done him ju stice. It’s a nice tribute to a man who touched so many lives. It says here that he’s s urvived by his wife and five children.

Stephan:  Did he live to a ripe old age?

Ivy:  He was 97 when he died. There’ll be a memoria l service and funeral for him this Saturday. I think I’ll send some flowers.

Stephan:  Really? You didn’t know him personally, d id you?

Ivy:  No, but it would be nice to be part of the fu neral, in some small way. I wonder who’ll be giving the eulogies. I’m sure it’l l be somebody important.

Stephan:  If you say so. I’ve never heard of him. W as he on a children’s show or something?

Ivy:  You’ve never heard of Mr. McBoo?! Were you ra ised in a cave?

Stephan:  Not quite. We didn’t have a TV in the hom e when I was growing up.

Ivy:  Oh, you poor, poor man. You’ve been deprived of Mr. McBoo all your life. Don’t worry. I’ll fix that. I have all of his shows , so we can have a viewing marathon this weekend.

Stephan:  Lucky me.

[end of dialog]

Ivy begins by saying to Stephan, “This is so sad!” Stephan says, “What is?” Ivy says, “I’m reading the obituary of one of my favori te actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.” An “obituary” (obituary) is a  short article or a short notice, printed in a newspaper, or nowadays, on the Interne t, after someone dies, about that person. It will say the person’s name, usually , how old they were, the date they died, and something about them, who they were.

Ivy says that she’s reading the obituary of one of her favorite actors when she was young, a Mr. McBoo. “He had quite a life,” Ivy says. The expression “to have quite (quite) a life” means that it was an interest ing or exciting life. Stephan says, “Oh yeah?” Ivy says, “Yeah, and this article has re ally done him justice.” “To do someone or something justice” is to do something ve ry well, to be good enough for that something, to do what that someone or some thing deserves. So, if a book does someone justice, we mean it describes the m accurately, correctly. It does what it should do in describing the life of th at person. When I sing, I never do the song justice because I do a very bad job. So , you can use it in the negative as well. “It doesn’t do him justice.” Noti ce we use the verb “to do” – “to do (a person)” or “to do (a thing) justice (justice ).”

Ivy says, “It’s a nice tribute to a man who touched  so many lives.” A “tribute” (tribute) is something that is done or said to show  respect for someone or to something, to show admiration. Sometimes, when some one is very famous and they get old, they will have a tribute on televisio n to that person, where other people will stand up and they will talk about what a wonderful person that is. That’s a tribute. Ivy says that this obituary is a nice tribute to a man who “touched so many lives.” “To touch (touch) a life” means to affect someone, to have an impact on someone in a positive way.

 Ivy says, “It says here that he” – Mr. McBoo – “is survived by his wife and his five children.” The expression “to be survived by someon e” means that those are the people, usually your close relatives, who are still  living. So, if I die and my wife is still living, my obituary would say that I was surv ived by my wife. That’s the close relation of mine who is still living. So, if you ar e survived by someone, those are people who continue to live even though you have di ed, and typically, that would be a spouse (your wife, your husband), your childre n, maybe brothers and sisters, cousins, perhaps even parents if someone d ies young.

Stephan says, “Did he live to a ripe old age?” The expression “A ripe (ripe) old age” just means a very old age. Typically, we use t his expression when the person not only has lived a long time, but they wer e in pretty good health even when they were old. They could still think clearly.  They were still very much active. Ivy says, “He was 97 when he died. There’ll  be a memorial service and funeral for him this Saturday.” A “memorial service ” is usually an event where people come and they talk about the person who has died. They remember him. They share their own memories with other people. A “funeral” is typically a more formal event, often a religious event, where the bo dy is either taken to a church and there is some sort of religious ceremony held, and/or to a cemetery where the body is put into the ground. A “cemetery” (ceme tery) is a place where bodies are buried – after you die, of course.

Ivy says, “I think I’ll send some flowers.” It’s co mmon when someone dies, especially if you’re not able to go to the memorial  service or funeral yourself, to send flowers, and those flowers are usually put nex t to the body or somewhere in the room where the service is being held. Stephan s ays, “Really? You didn’t know him personally, did you?” When we say we know someone “personally,” we mean we have met that person. We have shook their h ands. We’ve talked to them. We knew them personally. I know who the presi dent of the United States is, but I don’t know him personally. He’s never com e to my house for dinner, which is probably a good thing because I don’t cook  very well.

Ivy says, “No” – no, I didn’t know him personally –  “but it would be nice to be part of the funeral in some small way. I wonder who’ll b e giving the eulogies.” A “eulogy” (eulogy) means a speech, usually delivered  or given at a funeral where the speaker says nice things about the person who d ied. Sometimes, this is a done by a religious official. Sometimes, it’s done by a member of the family. It really depends on the situation. Not all memorial s ervices or funerals have eulogies. Some do, some don’t.

Ivy says “I’m sure” the person who will be giving t he eulogies will be “somebody important.” Stephan says, “If you say so.” This exp ression, “If you say so,” is used when you don’t really believe what the other p erson has said, but you don’t want to fight with them. You don’t want to argue wi th them. Someone may say, “Oh, this is the best Mexican food I’ve ever eaten! ” and you go, “Well, if you say so,” meaning you don’t really agree. You don’t thin k it’s very good, but you don’t want to argue with the person.

Stephan says, “I’ve never heard of him [of Mr. McBo o]. Was he on a children’s show or something?” “Was he on a show that was for children?” The phrase “or something” means “or something else” – something si milar. Ivy says, “You’ve never heard of Mr. McBoo!? Were you raised in a cav e?” A “cave” (cave) is a large covered space, usually in a mountain or some other rocky area, some other hilly area, maybe even underground, that is often t he home for certain animals. A “cave” is sort of like part of a mountain or a hill  or in the ground that has been carved out, often through water going through it, o r some other process over a long period of time. The expression, “Were you rais ed in cave,” however, really means “Did you grow up without any contact with the  rest of the world?” It’s sort of a criticism, a funny way of saying, “How could y ou not know about this person?” Only someone who grew up in the middle of the forest or on an island or in a cave would not have heard of this person be cause he’s so famous. That’s the idea.

Stephan responds to Ivy, “Not quite,” meaning no, I  didn’t grow up in a cave. “We didn’t have a TV in the home when I was growing up. ” So, he didn’t have a television in his house. That’s not very common any more, but it’s possible. Ivy says, “Oh, you poor, poor man.” She’s sort of being  funny here – “You poor,” meaning unfortunate, “man.” “You’ve been deprived o f Mr. McBoo all your life.” “To deprive” (deprive) means not to let someone hav e something that is necessary or perhaps is very enjoyable. Stephan has  been deprived of Mr. McBoo. He hasn’t been able to find out about Mr. Mc Boo his entire life.

“Don’t worry,” Ivy says, “I’ll fix that.” I’ll take  care of that situation. “I have all of his shows, so we can have a viewing marathon this weeke nd.” A “marathon” (marathon) is usually the word we use for a long ra ce, for people who are running. However, more recently, it has been used t o describe when a television channel has many different episodes of the same sho w on, on a single day, or on a single weekend. So, if we have a holiday weekend,  a weekend where we have three days that we don’t work, one of those days mi ght be a television marathon of a popular show. Usually, these are shows that we re on a long time ago. So, in 2012, it would be, perhaps, shows like Star Trek or  Seinfeld or Friends. There

might be a marathon of those shows. So they show on e show and then another one and then another one, and so forth.

Ivy wants to have a marathon of the old Mr. McBoo s hows. Stephan says, “Lucky me.” This expression is used jokingly, sarcasticall y, we would say, to mean that you don’t feel very lucky. It means the opposite of  what it says. It all depends on how you say it, but usually, it’s used as a joke. W hen someone says, “Oh, lucky me,” they mean I don’t feel so lucky. I have to exp erience this thing, but I’m not really happy about it. Stephan is not happy about h aving to watch all of these old children shows, and I kind of agree with Stephan. M r. McBoo, by the way, is not a real person, was not a real actor, which means, o f course, he didn’t really die.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Ivy:  This is so sad!

Stephan:  What is?

Ivy:  I’m reading the obituary for one of my favori te actors as a child, Mr. McBoo. He had quite a life.

This episode is about singing Christmas carols or C hristmas songs. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Andrea: What are you doing?

Stephanie: I’m coming up with a list of Christmas c arols to sing when we go caroling.

Andrea: Can I come?

Stephanie: Uh, I don’t think…

Andrea: What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that…

Andrea: You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that either…

Andrea: I know what it is. You think I’m too good. I’ll outshine the other singers. Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a b ushel, just this once.

Stephanie: Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t  think you’re a good fit for our group.

Andrea: Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeable abou t music and know all of the traditional carols. I’ve even composed some origina l ones that you might consider adding to your list.

Stephanie: I know you’re very knowledgeable about m usic, but in our group, it’s all about the singing voice.

Andrea: What’s wrong with my singing voice? Listen to this [sung loudly and poorly]: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…”

[end of dialog]

Andrea begins by saying, “What are you doing?” Step hanie says, “I’m coming up with” – I’m thinking about, I’m inventing – “a list  of Christmas carols to sing when we go caroling.” “Christmas” is the Christian holid ay, now celebrated by people who aren’t Christian, on December 25 th . And a “carol” (carol) is a traditional song that is sung during the Christmas season, during the weeks before and a few weeks after Christmas. “Caroling” (caroling) is a t radition where people get together in small groups and they go around and the y sing Christmas carols in public, usually for other people, usually outside –  that is, not inside of a building. I think I went Christmas caroling a couple of times w hen I was a teenager, not a lot. You don’t see people doing this very much anym ore.

Andrea says, “Can I come?” He wants to go with Step hanie. “Can I come?” “Can I come with you?” Stephanie says, “Uh, I don’t thin k…” Andrea says, “What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?” “To sing in tune” (tune) means to be able to sing a song with the right notes, not being higher or lowe r than you should be. Many people say I cannot sing in tune. That’s probably t rue. Stephanie says, “No, it’s not that…” meaning it’s not that she thinks he can’ t sing in tune. Andrea says, “You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?” Andrea is trying to understand why Stephanie is hesitant, that is, why she doesn’t see m to be very excited about him going with them on the Christmas caroling event. He  says, “You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?” The “lyrics” (lyrics) are the words that are sung in the song. Stephanie says, “No, it’s not that either…”

Andrea says, “I know what it is. You think I’m too good.” You think I’m going to be so much better than the other singers. Andrea says,  “I’ll outshine the other singers.” “To outshine” (outshine) – one word – mea ns to be better than other people, to be, we might say, “superior” to other pe ople. You’re so good that everyone sees how much better you are than the rest  of the group. Singers, of course, are the people who sing.

Andrea says, “Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my l ight under a bushel, just this once.” “To hide the light under a bushel” (bushel) means not to let other people know or see how good you are at doing something, ho w smart you are or how talented you are. The expression comes from the Bib le, from the New Testament, from one of the stories that Jesus tells  in the Bible. The word “bushel” is what we would call a “unit of measurement” equal  to about 36 liters. It’s a measure of volume, of capacity. But in the expressi on, it really refers to a large container, like a large basket or bucket that would  be big enough to hold a bushel of something. If you turn the container upside down  and put a light underneath it, of course, you can’t see the light. And that’s wher e the expression comes from.

Andrea is saying that because he is such a good sin ger, he won’t try to outshine the other singers. He won’t sing as good as he coul d sing. He says he’ll do this “just this once.” The expression “Just this once,” means only one time. You’re going to do something differently than the way you would normally do it.

Stephanie says, “Well, it’s not that either. I just  don’t think you’re a good fit for our group.” “To be a good fit” (fit) means to be simila r to other people or other things in a group, especially if you’re going to spend a l ot of time with them. Sometimes companies will tell people interviewing for a job a t that company that they’re not a “good fit for this position.” That means they don’t  think you have the exact qualifications or characteristics that would work w ell in a certain job. Here, it means that Andrea isn’t like the rest of the group that’s going to be singing and so, it wouldn’t be a good fit.

Andrea says, “Not a good fit? I’m very knowledgeabl e about music and know all of the traditional carols.” Andrea says he knows a lot about music and he knows all of the “traditional” carols. “Traditional,” her e, refers to things that have a long history, things that have been going on for a long time. Usually, we use this adjective in talking about culture or customs. “Tra ditional carols” would be carols that have been sung for many years, many generation s even.

Andrea says that he knows all of the traditional ca rols. “I’ve even composed some original ones that you might consider adding t o your list.”  “To compose” (compose) means to create a new piece of music and,  usually, write it down so that other people can play it themselves. Bach, Bee thoven, Mozart, Brahms – these were all great composers of earlier centuries . Anyone who writes the music for a song can be called a “composer,” with an -r a t the end. “To compose,” however, is the verb.

Andrea says he’s composed some original carols. “Or iginal,” here means new, that have not been created before. Stephanie says, “I know you’re very

knowledgeable about music, but in our group, it’s a ll about the singing voice.” “The singing voice” is how well someone sings. Your  “voice” (voice) is the sound that you make, that comes out of your mouth. Usuall y, you are saying something that people can understand, although my wife thinks  I make a lot of noise that no one understands, at least, her.

Andrea is, according to Stephanie, someone who does n’t have a very good singing voice. So, you see, Stephanie was lying ear lier in the dialog when she said that it wasn’t about the fact that Andrea coul dn’t sing in tune and so forth. Really, she doesn’t think Andrea is a very good sin ger. And now, we finally hear her say that directly. Andrea says, “What’s wrong w ith my singing voice? Listen to this…” And then he tries to sing a traditional c arol called “Jingle bells.”

Jingle bells” (jingle bells) – two words – is a pop ular holiday song, a popular Christmas song describing the ringing or jingling o f bells. The song goes “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way…” But Andre a’s not a very good singer so it sounds like: “Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle al l the way…”

Wait a minute, that’s how I sound!

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Andrea: What are you doing?

Stephanie: I’m coming up with a list of Christmas c arols to sing when we go caroling.

Andrea: Can I come?

Stephanie: Uh, I don’t think…

Andrea: What? You don’t think I can sing in tune?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that…

Andrea: You think I’m going to forget the lyrics?

Stephanie: No, it’s not that either…

Andrea: I know what it is. You think I’m too good. I’ll outshine the other singers. Don’t worry. I don’t mind hiding my light under a b ushel, just this once.

Stephanie: Well, it’s not that either. I just don’t  think you’re a good fit for our group.

# Learning Fire Safety

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 855: Learning Fire Safety.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 855. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from beautiful Los An geles, California and the Center for Educational Development.

ESLPod.com is our website. When you go there, you c an become a member and download a Learning Guide for this episode. Do it t oday before you forget.

This episode is a story about learning fire safety – learning to make sure that you don’t accidentally cause a fire that will damage yo ur house or building. Sounds like a good idea. Let’s get started! > The apartment manager asked all of the tenants to c ome to a short meeting to learn about fire safety.  I didn’t want to go, but the manager said that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza? ...
> Apartment manager:  Thank you all for coming to thi s meeting about fire safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recentl y, it seemed like a good idea to talk about fire safety with all of you.
> I want to make sure we comply with the fire code, s o I’ve installed new smoke alarms or replaced the batteries in the older ones in each apartment and in the hallways.  The fire escapes are in good condition a nd there are fire extinguishers in each hallway.
> Your job is to keep the inside of your apartments s afe.  Keep flammable items away from the fireplace and don’t overload your ele ctrical outlets.  Any questions?  If not, we’re ready for a fire drill. ...
> Nobody told me there would be fire drill.  I’m gues s I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll – as long as I can take the pizza with me.

Our story begins with me – the person telling the s tory – saying that “the apartment manager” – the person who takes care of t he apartment where I live, in the story – “asked all of the tenants” – the peo ple who rent apartments – “to come to a short meeting to learn about fire safety. ” “Fire safety” are things you should do in order to prevent fires and to keep peo ple safe if there is a fire. I say that “I didn’t want to go, but that the manager sai d that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza?” “To turn dow n” is a phrasal verb which, here, means to decide not to do something or not to  have something, to say no to someone. “I asked a beautiful woman out on a date a nd she turned me down.” She said, “No, thank you, Jeff.” Well, this was man y years ago, of course. I actually put this in the form of a question – “Who am I to turn down free pizza?” When we say, “Who am I to do something,” we’re kind  of making a joke about it, saying, “Well, I’m not an important enough person t o say no,” or “I have to do this,” or “I don’t have any right or any permission  to do something differently.”

The apartment manager begins, then – and he sounds a lot like me – by saying, “Thank you all for coming to this meeting about fir e safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recently, it seemed like a goo d idea to talk about fire safety with all of you.” A “rash” (rash) is when something  is very common – a short period of time, usually, when something bad is happ ening. If there were four people murdered in the last week, we could talk abo ut a “rash of murders” here in Los Angeles. I’m not saying there were, maybe there  were, but that would be an example. Or, “There have been a rash of cases invol ving people who are stealing cars.” Usually, the word “rash” is used when someth ing bad happens. Well, this is a case where something bad is happening. There h ave been a rash of fires in the neighborhood.

The manager says that he wants to make sure we “com ply” with the “fire code.” “To comply” (comply) means to follow the rules or t o follow the laws, to do what you are supposed to do. The “fire code” are a serie s or a set of rules and regulations, or laws, established to protect people  from fires. So, when you build a new building, or you build a house, you have to f ollow the rules to make sure that you’re not building something that could be da ngerous. Those rules are called the “fire code (code).” The word “code” is o ften used to describe government regulations that you have to follow. And  if you don’t follow them, you could be in trouble.

The manager says he’s “installed new smoke alarms.”  “To install” (install) means to put something into place, often to attach it to something so that it can be used. “I’m going to install a new sink in my bathroom.” I ’m going to put it in. I’m going to put it in place. We talk about, on our computers, “ installing software.” We download it from the Internet or we buy it, and we put it on to our hard drive, our

computer. That is also another use of the verb “ins tall.” The manager has installed, or put in, new “smoke alarms.”

“Smoke” (smoke) is when something burns and it give s off a certain substance that floats in the air. If you breathe it, you will  probably cough and it could kill you. “Smoke” happens when there is a fire. In fact, ther e’s an old expression “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire,” meaning if you see an  indication of a problem, there probably is a real problem, maybe even more serious  than you know. However, a “smoke alarm” is a device, a small instrument, that  makes a noise when there is smoke in the room. Most houses have smoke alarms, a t least a couple of them. “Smoke alarms” are required in public buildings.

Well, the apartment manager installed new smoke ala rms or he replaced, or put in, batteries in the older ones. A “battery” (batte ry) is a small object that provides electricity to a machine. It can often be removed, unless you have certain kinds of phones where the battery can’t be removed, at le ast not by you. But most batteries are things you can take out and put new o nes in or you can what we would call “recharge” them. You can give them more power, new power so that they will work again. The manager continues by sayi ng that the “fire escapes” are in good condition. A “fire escape” (escape) is a wa y of leaving a building in the case of a fire. We often think about fire escapes a s being stairs, metal stairs on the outside of a building, so that if you’re in a b uilding, you can climb out the window, you can exit the building through the windo w, onto these stairs that area outside. We would call them “fire escapes.” A “fire  escape” might also be a ladder that is put up on the side of a building or more ty pically, dropped down from the window. Those are examples of fire escapes.

The manager says, “The fire escapes in the apartmen t building are in good condition” – they’re working fine, no problems – “a nd there are fire extinguishers in each hallway.” An “extinguisher” is something th at extinguishes. The verb “to extinguish” (extinguish) means to stop something, i n this case, from burning, usually. A fire extinguisher is a metal container, a cylinder, often painted red or yellow, that has special chemicals in it that when you spray it on a fire, it will put the fire out. It will stop the fire. That’s a “fire  extinguisher.”

The manager says the fire extinguishers are in each  “hallway.” A “hallway” is a space that connects different rooms in a building o r in a house, in this case, in the apartment building. The manager concludes by sa ying, “Your job” – meaning what the tenants, the renters are supposed to do – “is keep the inside of your apartments safe. Keep flammable objects away from t he fireplace.” “Flammable” (flammable) is something that will burn easily. And  if something burns easily, if it

can “catch fire,” we might say, easily, you don’t w ant to put it near your fireplace where you might be burning wood to bring heat into your house.

Also, “Don’t overload your electrical outlets,” the  manager says. “To overload” (overload) means to put too much pressure or to dem and too much of something, or someone. In this case, it would be trying to plu g in all of your electrical devices into one electrical circuit or even one plug, one o utlet. This, in some cases, can be dangerous and can even start a fire. “Electrical  outlets” (outlets) are the things that you plug your power cords into, what gives you  electricity – we call those “outlets,” “electrical outlets.”

 “Any questions?”  the manager says. “If not, we’re  ready for a fire drill.” A “fire drill” (drill) is an event where people in a buildi ng are asked to pretend – to imagine – that there is a fire, and practice leavin g the building quickly and in an orderly way, usually going outside and all meeting in the same spot. “Fire drills” are things that typically happen in schools, especi ally the elementary and high schools. We would have a fire drill at least once, sometimes twice a year, where the fire bell would ring and everyone would have to  stand up and walk out of the school in a calm and orderly way. That’s a “fire dr ill.” It’s something you don’t usually see in a building, an office building or a commercial building nowadays. But it is still quite common in schools, because we  want to train students on what to do if there is a fire.

I end the story by saying, “Nobody told me that the re would be a fire drill. I guess I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll as long as I can take the pizza with me.” “To stop, drop, and roll” is a common phrase used to re mind people what they should do if they are in a building during a fire. You sto p whatever you’re doing. You drop or fall down to the ground, and then you roll along the ground to move toward the exit while preventing or stopping your c lothes from catching on fire – “Stop, drop, and roll.” That’s the recommended proc edure. Most people, of course, use another procedure when a fire breaks ou t in their building, and that’s “Run like hell!” – which is a somewhat vulgar way o f saying “Run really fast!”

Now let’s listen to the story this time, at a normal speed.

[start of story]

The apartment manager asked all of the tenants to c ome to a short meeting to learn about fire safety.  I didn’t want to go, but the manager said that there would be free food, and who am I to turn down free pizza? ...

Apartment manager:  Thank you all for coming to thi s meeting about fire safety. With the rash of fires in this neighborhood recentl y, it seemed like a good idea to talk about fire safety with all of you.

I want to make sure we comply with the fire code, s o I’ve installed new smoke alarms or replaced the batteries in the older ones in each apartment and in the hallways.  The fire escapes are in good condition a nd there are fire extinguishers in each hallway.

Your job is to keep the inside of your apartments s afe.  Keep flammable items away from the fireplace and don’t overload your ele ctrical outlets.  Any questions?  If not, we’re ready for a fire drill. ...

Nobody told me there would be fire drill.  I’m gues s I’m ready to stop, drop, and roll – as long as I can take the pizza with me.

# Training Salespeople

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 856: Training Salespeople.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 856. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is, like all of our episodes, one that  has a Learning Guide. You can find that guide at ESLPod.com.

Today we’re going to talk about training salespeopl e – people who, well, sell things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Our company brought in a consultant to do sales tra ining for our store.  For some reason, we’d been getting some complaints from cust omers.

Consultant:  My job in this training is to help you r store improve its customer satisfaction, so that it can attract and retain mor e customers.  When you interact with customers, you represent this store.  It is ve ry important that, from the get- go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positiv e way.

Employee:  Sometimes, people are really rude.  They  don’t even say “hello” back.

Consultant:  That may be true, but it’s still your job to make them feel welcomed. Each customer should feel that a salesperson is att entive and trying to meet their needs.

Employee:  Some of them don’t even know what they w ant.  They wander around and waste our time.

Consultant:  Part of your job is to help them defin e their needs, offer them options, and lead them to a decision.  I know that you’re not working on commission, but this is a very important part of yo ur job.

Employee:  You mean I have to hold their hand the w hole time they’re in the store?  Who am I, their mother?

Consultant:  I can see that we have a lot of work t o do.  Let’s get started.

[end of dialog]

Our story begins with an employee of a certain comp any telling us that his company brought in a “consultant to do sales traini ng for our store.” A “consultant” (consultant) is a person that a compan y hires to either complete a specific project or often, to provide help to emplo yees, permanent employees, of a company. The consultant only works, typically, for a short amount of time. Maybe a company needs someone to help them with acc ounting or maybe they need someone to help them as, in the case of our st ory, with selling and helping their sales people sell better.

That’s what this consultant did. She came in to do sales training to help the sales people – the salesmen and saleswomen – sell better.  “For some reason, we’ve been getting some complaints from customers.” “Comp laints” (complaints) are when people say they don’t like what you are doing.  Often, they are saying that things are not as good as they should be. This shir t is too small. It’s too cold in here. This food tastes horrible. Those would all be  complaints in different areas to different kinds of companies. “To complain” is t he verb.

Well, this company, this store, has been getting co mplaints from customers – people who buy things. The consultant begins by say ing, “My job” – or my task – “is to help your store improve its customer satisfa ction.” “Satisfaction” is a measure of how well you like something. So, “custom er satisfaction” would be how much the people who buy from your store like wh at they’re getting, like the experience of buying in your store and so forth.

The consultant is doing this so that the store can attract and retain more customers. “To attract” means to get more. “To reta in” (retain) means to keep them. So, in any sort of business where you sell so mething, first you have to get people to buy something from you once, and the idea  is you want to keep them coming back and buying from you again and again. Th at’s to retain a customer.

The consultant says, “When you interact with custom ers, you represent this store.” “To interact” (interact) is to have some so rt of communication with another person or some other sort of exchange of informatio n. Talking to someone would be an “interaction,” to use the noun. “I am interac ting with a customer.” We use this term as an adjective – “interactive” – to mean  something that you can do on a computer or on an electrical device like a tablet  or a phone, a smartphone, that allows you not just to get information but to give information back to whoever designed that particular program. So, “interact” ha s a couple of different

meanings including, as I said, one that is now rela ted to an adjective, “interactive,” in dealing with software, computer s oftware.

Moving on here, the consultant says that “when you interact with customers, you represent this store.” When you “represent” some gr oup or some organization, people see you as someone who is speaking for and a cting on behalf of that organization. So, when you walk into a store and the person, the salesperson, isn’t very nice to you, you get a bad idea, a bad i mpression about that store. The salesperson represents the store. The store is repr esented by its salespeople.

The consultant continues, “It is very important tha t from the get-go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positive way.” The ex pression “from the get-go” means from the very beginning, from the very first moment. “I knew that he was going to lose the game from the get-go.” As soon as  he started, I knew he was going to lose. It’s a somewhat informal expression,  perhaps not quite as common as it was a few years ago.

In any case, the consultant says that “It is very i mportant that from the get-go, customers are greeted in a friendly and positive wa y.” “To be greeted” means to have someone say ‘hello’ to you. “To greet” is to s ay, ‘hello,’ to make another person feel welcome. Many times when you walk into a store in the United States, there’ll be someone working for the store s tanding in the doorway or towards the front of the store, to welcome you into  the store. “Hello, thank you for coming. Can I help you with anything?” That would b e someone greeting you. “To greet” can also just mean to say “hello.” I gre eted my friend when I saw her in the parking lot. I said “hello” to her.

The employee says, “Sometimes people are really rud e. They don’t even say ‘hello’ back.” So the employee is already sort of d oubting the consultant’s advice. He says, “Sometimes people are really rude. “To be rude (rude)” means not nice, not kind, to be mean, to be impolite. “They don’t e ven say ‘hello’ back,” meaning you say “hello” to them, but they don’t say “hello”  to you. That’s what the word “back” means here – in return, in response to you.

The consultant says, “That maybe true” – maybe you’ re right – “but it’s still your job to make them feel welcomed”  - that is, make th em feel like you’re happy they are there. “Each customer should feel that a salesp erson is attentive and trying to meet their needs.” “To be attentive” (attentive) me ans to give your full attention or full focus to something, to be paying attention. A waiter in a restaurant who is attentive is always checking back to make sure if y ou need anything, is always making sure you have enough water or enough soda, o r enough whatever it is that you’re drinking – beer, wine, whiskey. You get  the idea.

 The consultant says that a salesperson is attentive  and tries to meet the customer’s needs. “To meet someone’s needs” is to d o what that person needs or expects. The employee says, “Some of them” – mea ning some of the customers – “don’t even know what they want. They w ander around and waste our time.” “To wander (wander) around” means to wal k around slowly through an area without any clear purpose, without any goal. Y ou’re not quite sure what you’re doing. You’re just kind of walking. You’re w andering or wandering around. The employee is complaining some that some people c ome into the store and they wander around and they don’t really know what they want.

The consultant says, “Part of your job is to help t hem define their needs.” “To define (define)” can mean to give the meaning of a word. Here, however it means to identify, to describe something, to, we might sa y, “clarify,” to make clear what that person might want, or in this case, what they might need. So the consultant says that “Part of your job is to help them define their needs, offer them options” – choices – “and lead them to a decision. I know th at you’re not working on commission but this is a very important part of you r job.” “To be working on commission” means that you get a percentage of ever ything you sell. In some stores, especially those that sell expensive things , the salesperson will get a small percentage of every sale. This, of course, gi ves them a motivation, a good reason for wanting to do a good job. In other store s, the salesperson doesn’t get any commission, and often, when that happens, the s alesperson doesn’t do a very good job.

The employee, who’s obviously not a very good sales person, says, “You mean” – do you mean – “I have to hold their hand the whole time they’re in the store?” “To hold someone’s hand” here means to help them and to  guide them every step of the way – giving them advice, giving them encourage ment, telling them how good something looks on them, to be paying attentio n to them the whole time. The employee says, “You mean I have to hold their h and the whole time they’re in the store? Who am I, their mother?” The employee  is making a joke saying, “Well, I’m not their mother. I don’t have to pay at tention to them and hold their hand walking around the store.” When we say “to hol d their hand,” we don’t mean you actually hold their hand with your hand. W e mean to pay attention, to pay close attention to them. The consultant says, “ I can see that we have a lot of work to do.” This expression means that there are a  lot of problems here, as demonstrated by the responses of this employee – th is salesperson. So, they have a lot of work to do, a lot of changes to make.  “Let’s get started.”

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Our company brought in a consultant to do sales tra ining for our store.  For some reason, we’d been getting some complaints from cust omers.

Consultant:  My job in this training is to help you r store improve its customer satisfaction, so that it can attract and retain mor e customers.

Employee:  Some of them don’t even know what they w ant.  They wander around and waste our time.

Consultant:  Part of your job is to help them defin e their needs, offer them options, and lead them to a decision.  I know that you’re not working on commission, but this is a very important part of yo ur job.

Employee:  You mean I have to hold their hand the w hole time they’re in the store?  Who am I, their mother?

Consultant:  I can see that we have a lot of work t o do.  Let’s get started.

# Being Arrested by the Police

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 857: Being Arrested by the Police.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 857. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California, home of ESL Podc ast.

This episode, like all of our episodes has a Learni ng Guide. You can get one by going to our website at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a story about someone, well, gettin g into trouble and being taken by the police. Let’s get started. > I was walking down the street minding my own busine ss one evening when I was stopped by a police officer.  After asking me a cou ple of questions about where I’d been, he told me to put my hands behind my back .  He was going to arrest me!  He handcuffed me and gave me the Miranda warni ng.  When I asked him why he was arresting me, he said that he had probab le cause to believe that I was the suspect they had been looking for in a robb ery that took place on the next street.
> I couldn’t believe it!  I was completely innocent, but the officer didn’t want to hear it.  He put me in the back of a police car and drov e me to the police station.  I was placed in a jail cell and, after a few hours, I  was taken to a room and interrogated.
> A police officer asked me question after question, and after four hours of questioning, I was finally released!  I found out l ater that it was a case of mistaken identity.  I looked very much like the sus pect they were looking for and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
> I could sue the police department for false arrest,  but I decided not to.  I’d rather put the entire thing behind me and hope that I’m ne ver that unlucky again!

Our story begins by me telling about how I was walk ing down the street, minding my own business. The expression “to mind (mind) you r own business” means

that you’re paying attention to your own affairs, y our own concerns, and you’re not becoming involved with any other situation – yo u’re not interacting or talking to other people. You’re not trying to cause problem s. We often use this expression when someone perhaps is getting involved  in something they shouldn’t be. We might say, “Mind you own business! ” Someone asked you questions about your ex-girlfriend and wants to kno w why the two of you stopped dating. You might say, “Mind your own business.”

Well, that’s what I was trying to do. I was trying not to get involved in anything as I was walking down the street. However, I was stopp ed by a police officer. A “police officer” is a person whose job it is to pro tect and defend people and the things people own, what we call “property,” and mak e sure everyone is obeying the law. A more informal term for a police officer is a “cop” (cop).

“After asking me a question about where I’ve been,”  I say, “he” – the police officer – “told me to put my hands behind my back” – put my hands or put my arms behind my back. The reason was that the office r was going to arrest me. “To arrest” (arrest) means for a police officer to take someone back to a police station and keep them there, often, for a very long  time if they think the person has committed a crime, has done something against t he law.

The officer “handcuffed me.” “To handcuff (handcuff )” is to put these two circles of metal around your wrist that are connected so th at you can’t move your arms very easily. The noun is “handcuffs,” and the verb is “to handcuff.” “To handcuff” is to put handcuffs on someone’s wrist – on their a rms. The “Miranda warning” is something that is only done here in the United Stat es, at least, it’s only called the Miranda warning here. The Miranda warning is a stat ement that police officers have to make to people when they’re being arrested,  telling them that they have certain legal rights. They don’t have to talk to the police. “You have a right to remain silent,” we say. You don’t have to say anyth ing if you’re being arrested, at least, that’s the law. That doesn’t always happen o f course. The Miranda warning is called the Miranda warning based on an old Supre me Court ruling – a decision made by our highest court many years ago, back in t he 1960’s, I believe.

I continue the story by saying, “When I asked him w hy he was arresting me, he said that he had probable cause to believe that I w as the suspect they had been looking for.” “Probable (probable)” is related to t he word “probably” and it means that it seems likely that something will happen, or  it seems likely that something is true. “Cause” (cause) is the reason for somethin g, why something happened. So, “probable cause” means we have a good reason – something that is likely to be true – to believe that you are involved in this crime. At least that’s how the phrase is used here in the story.

 We talk about police having probable cause. We mean  they have a good enough reason to arrest someone. Well, the officer thought  he had probable cause that I was the suspect. A “suspect” (suspect) is a person who you think has done something wrong. You’re not sure. It hasn’t been pr oven, but you have good reason to think this person committed the crime – d id something against the law. In this case, the crime was a “robbery” (robbery). A “robbery” is when you steal or take something, especially money or some other obje ct without someone’s permission. That would be robbery.

I then say, “I couldn’t believe it. I was completel y innocent.” “To be innocent (innocent)” is the opposite of “guilty,”  when you have not done anything wrong. I say that “I was completely innocent but the officer ” – the police officer – “didn’t want to hear it.” He didn’t want to listen to me. “ He put me in the back of a police car and drove to the police station.” The “police s tation” is the building where the police officers work. Big cities like Los Angeles h ave several police stations located in different parts of the city.

“I was placed in a jail cell.” A “jail (jail) cell (cell)” is a small room in a jail or a prison where one or two, maybe a few more prisoners  are kept – where they are put so that they don’t leave. “After a few hours, I  was taken to a room and interrogated.” The verb “to interrogate” (interroga te) means to ask a lot of questions, often in a very, what we might call “agg ressive” way, maybe even an angry way. The verb is used whenever the police are  asking questions, not because they always ask in an aggressive, angry way , but because they want to find out what the truth is.

So, the verb doesn’t necessarily have to be a negat ive one, in the sense that you’re angry when you’re asking the question. But i t’s only used, typically, when we’re talking about the police or maybe a member of  the military interrogating a prisoner, something like that. “A police officer as ked me question after question,” I say, “and after four hours of questioning, I was finally released.” “To release” (release) means to let someone go from the place wh ere you were holding that person. Normally, we talk about being released from  prison. But a student might also be released from school, just kind of like a p rison, I guess, sometimes.

“I found out later that it was a case of mistaken i dentity.” “Mistaken” comes from the word “mistake,” which means an error, something  that went wrong. “Identity” refers to who a person is. So, “mistaken identity” would be being wrong about who you think a person is. Someone came up to me an d thought I was Brad Pitt and wanted my autograph, I said, “Well, okay.” It r eally was a case of mistaken identity.

 “I looked very much like the suspect they were look ing for,” I continue, “and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” That’s an ol d expression – “to be in a wrong place at the wrong time.” It means you were s omewhere where you were innocent, you weren’t doing anything wrong but just  by luck, you were in a bad situation or you were at a place at the wrong time,  at a time when something bad happened. “I could sue the police for false arrest but I decided not to.” “To sue” means to go to a judge, go to a court and ask for m oney. It’s possible if a police officer arrests you and did something wrong in that  process. You could sue the police department for false arrest. “False arrest” is a situation where you are taken by the police but they didn’t do it properly.  They should not have arrested you. “False,” of course, is, in this case, sort of wrong or mistaken. “I’d rather put the entire thing behind me,” I say. “To put somethi ng behind you” means to forget about it, to act as though it never happened. That’ s usually a good idea for bad relationships, just put them behind you, forget abo ut them – “move on,” we would say.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 858: Donating an Organ.

This episode is a dialog between Christine and Saul , about donating a part of your body to someone else. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Christine:  What is this sticker on your driver’s l icense?

Saul:  This sticker?  It indicates that I’ve signed  up for the organ donation program.  If anything bad happens to me, I want my organs to go to recipients who need them.

Christine:  You mean you want somebody else to have  your heart, liver...

Saul:  ...eyes, kidneys, or anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.  Don’t you want to donate your organs?

Christine:  Me?  No way.  I’ll never consent to doc tors cutting up my body after I die.  Those organs are a part of me.

Saul:  But you won’t need them when you’re dead, an d there are long waiting lists at eye banks and organ registries. Your organ  donation might be the difference between life and death for somebody, you  know.

Christine:  That might be true, but I can’t imagine  somebody else walking around with my brain.

Saul:  Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.

[end of dialog]

 Our dialog begins with Christine asking Saul, “What  is this sticker on your driver’s license?” A “sticker” (sticker) is a small piece of  paper, usually with a word or a picture on it that you put on something and it stic ks to it. The verb “to stick” means to adhere, to stay on something so that it wo n’t come off. A sticker is used, for example, on the back of your car. You can  put a, what we would call a “bumper sticker” on the back of your car. Basically , it’s a piece of paper with a little bit of glue or some sort of substance on the  back that will allow it to be placed on another object.

Saul has a sticker on his driver’s license. A “driv er’s license” is usually a small plastic card with your name and your picture on it that shows that you have permission to drive in a certain state. Each state has its own driver’s license in the United States but if you have a driver’s licens e from one state, you can drive in any state.

Saul says, “This sticker? It indicates that I’ve si gned up for the organ donation program.” Saul says the sticker “indicates,” meanin g it shows. It makes something clear. It makes something understood. It indicates that I’ve signed up; that is, I’ve become a member of the organ donation  program. An “organ” (organ) is a part of your body like your lungs, your kidney , your heart, your pancreas – all of these would be organs in your body. They’re part s of your body. “Donation” means a gift – to give something to someone. The ve rb is “to donate” (donate). “Organ donation,” then, is when you give a part of your body to another person. You can do this while you are living. For example, you can donate a kidney to someone because most people are born with two kidne ys and so, you can give one to someone else. It might be something that hap pens after you die. You may donate part of your body to someone else who is liv ing because after all, if you’re dead, you don’t need your organs anymore, probably.

Saul says that “If anything bad happens to me” – th at is, if he gets injured or killed – “I want my organs to go to recipients who need them.” A “recipient” (recipient) is someone who receives something. Some one who is given something is a recipient. We might talk about someo ne being a recipient of an award. “He was a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize .” “He was a recipient of an Oscar Award.”

You can also be a recipient, in this case, of an or gan. Christine says, “You mean you want somebody else to have your heart, liver” –  she starts naming some of the organs. Your heart, you probably know, is the o rgan in your chest that pumps or moves blood throughout the body. Your “liver” (l iver) is something near your stomach that filters blood as it goes through your body. Saul says, “… eyes,

kidneys and anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.” Your kidney, as I mentioned earlier, is something that y ou actually have two of. You have two kidneys and it also is involved in filteri ng your blood. I’m not a doctor – not a real doctor – so I don’t have a good explanat ion for what all the organs do. But you studied biology, right? You know what organ s are.

Saul wants his organs to be transplanted into someo ne else. “To transplant” means to move something from one place to another. We talk about organ transplants. The verb is “to transplant.” You can a lso talk about transplanting plants, trees, people – those things can all be tra nsplanted, moved from one place to another.

Saul then asks Christine, “Don’t you want to donate  your organs?” Christine says, “Me? No way!” – absolutely not, she says. “I’ ll never consent to doctors cutting up my body after I die.” “To consent” (cons ent) means to agree to do something. Someone says, “I will not consent to tha t,” meaning I will not agree to that. I will not say “yes” to that. Christine says she’ll never consent to doctors cutting up her body after she dies. “To cut up” mea ns to cut into, to open up your skin and take things from the inside of your body.

Christine says, “Those organs are part of me.” Saul  says, “But you won’t need them when you’re dead and there are long waiting li sts at eye banks and organ registries.” A “waiting list” is a long list of peo ple who want something but there isn’t enough of that something. So they have to wai t for it. You can have a waiting list for all sorts of things. At our colleg es and universities, sometimes there aren’t enough spaces in the classroom, and so  some courses have waiting lists.  You have to wait and hope that there will b e room in the class for you.

Many people need organs and so, there are waiting l ists for organ transplants. One kind of place where people put their name down,  we might say – where they join a waiting list – is an eye bank. An “eye bank”  (bank) is a place that stores what are called “corneas,” parts of an eye  that ar e taken from the bodies of people who have died. And they use these to help pe ople who are living see better. An “organ registry” (registry) is an offici al list of people waiting for organs. A “registry” is any sort of official list or record . We also use this term when we are talking about legal matters. We might talk about an  official registry with the government – an official list of people.

Saul says, “Your organ donation might be the differ ence between life and death for somebody.” The phrase “the difference between l ife and death” here means that something is so important, it could decide whe ther someone lives or dies. It

is something that very important. Here, we’re talki ng about a case where someone could actually die if they did not get an o rgan.

However, the expression is also used in cases where  we’re trying to say something is extremely or very important. A related  expression is a “matter (matter) of life and death,” which means the same t hing. However, I should point out that the original expression, back before the 1 9th  century anyway, was “a matter of life or  death,” which makes more sense. Either you live or  you die. You can’t live and  die. It can’t be life “and” death. It has to be li fe “or” death. However, most people use the expression “life and death.” Yo u will still hear the original expression but they both mean the same thing.

Christine says, “That might be true.” It might be t rue that it’s a matter of life and or death. “But I can’t imagine somebody else walkin g around with my brain.” Your brain is the organ in your head. Most people have a  brain. I know some people who I don’t think have brains, but most people have  brains. My neighbor? Hmm…

Saul says, “Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.” So, Christine is worried that they might transplant her brain into someone else. And, of course, as of 2012, we don’t transplant people’s brains. But Saul agrees w ith Christine. He doesn’t think Christine is very smart, and so he says “Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.” The expression “come to think of it” is used to mea n that you’ve thought about something and you now have a different opinion or a  new understanding about something. “Me neither” is a slightly ungrammatical  way of saying “Neither do I.” In common conversation however, people don’t say, t ypically, “Neither do I.” They’ll say something like, “Me neither,” even thou gh “me” is not a subject pronoun. It should be “I” but we say it anyway. Sau l is saying, “I don’t think anyone would want your brain either, Christine, bec ause you’re stupid.” That’s really what Saul is saying, isn’t he?

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Christine:  What is this sticker on your driver’s l icense?

Saul:  This sticker?  It indicates that I’ve signed  up for the organ donation program.  If anything bad happens to me, I want my organs to go to recipients who need them.

Christine:  You mean you want somebody else to have  your heart, liver...

 Saul:  ...eyes, kidneys, or anything else that can be transplanted into someone else.  Don’t you want to donate your organs?

Christine:  Me?  No way.  I’ll never consent to doc tors cutting up my body after I die.  Those organs are a part of me.

Saul:  But you won’t need them when you’re dead, an d there are long waiting lists at eye banks and organ registries. Your organ  donation might be the difference between life and death for somebody, you  know.

Christine:  That might be true, but I can’t imagine  somebody else walking around with my brain.

Saul:  Hmm, come to think of it, me neither.

# Attending an Ex¡¦s Wedding

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 859: Attending an Ex’s Wedding.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast epsiod e 859. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to your from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. You know that, but did y ou also know that you can become a Learning Guide member and download? That’s  right, a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog between Andy and Yuka abou t going to the wedding – the marriage ceremony – of someone who used to be y our boyfriend or girlfriend. Sounds pretty interesting. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Andy:  What did you do last weekend?

Yuka:  I went to Jamal’s wedding.

Andy:  Jamal?!  Your ex Jamal?

Yuka:  Yes, that Jamal.

Andy:  He had the nerve to invite you to his weddin g?

Yuka:  I actually thought it was nice of him to inv ite me.  Whatever happened between us years ago is water under the bridge.  Th ere are no hard feelings on either side.

Andy:  You told me that the breakup was mutual, but  I always thought you still had a soft place in your heart for him.

Yuka:  The truth is, when we first broke up, I did harbor some hopes of the two of us getting back together, but that never came to pa ss.  We both moved on and I wish him well.

Andy:  Well, how was the wedding?

Yuka:  It was very nice and Jamal’s new wife seems to be a good match for him.

Andy:  And you didn’t mind seeing them together?

Yuka:  Not at all, especially after I met Lorenzo.

Andy:  Lorenzo, huh?  You’ve been holding out on me .  Do tell!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Andy asking Yuka, “What did you do last weekend?” Yuka says, “I went to Jamal’s wedding.” A “wedding” is a n official ceremony where two people promise to, well it depends on the people, b ut typically, they promise to be married to each other until they die. That doesn ’t always happen. I understand. Yuka says that she went to Jamal’s wedd ing. Andy says, “Jamal?! Your ex Jamal?” “Ex” (ex) means my ex-boyfriend or my ex-girlfriend. It could also mean my ex-husband or my ex-wife. We just use the letters “ex” sometimes in informal conversation when we mean ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. Here, it’s Yuka’s ex-boyfriend.

Yuka says, “Yes, that Jamal,” meaning that’s the Ja mal I’m talking about. Andy is obviously surprised. Andy says, “He had the nerve t o invite you to his wedding?” The expression “to have the nerve (nerve)” means to  do something very surprising, very surprising, but also very rude, ve ry unkind, and to do it without being sorry about it. We might also use the adjecti ves “bold” and “arrogant” when trying to define this expression. “You have the ner ve to tell me that my hair looks bad, when you’re bald yourself” – when you don’t ha ve any hair yourself? That’s what I said to somebody the other day. Well, Andy i s surprised that Jamal had the nerve to invite Yuka to his wedding. “To invite ” means to ask someone to participate or to come to some sort of event.

Yuka says, “I actually thought it was nice of him t o invite me.” So, Yuka was happy that her ex invited her. “Whatever happened b etween us years ago is water under the bridge.” Yuka is saying that no mat ter what happened, even if bad things happened many years ago, that is now all  “water under the bridge (bridge).” The expression “something is water under  the bridge” means something happened a long time ago but it’s no long er important and I’ve sort of forgotten about it, really. It’s not something that  bothers me anymore.

Maybe you and your brother had an argument and you’ re mad at each other for many months or even years. And then, you decide to forgive your brother or he forgives you or you forgive each other, and you for get about that thing that

happened. You say, “Oh, that’s water under the brid ge.” You can think about a river, of course, full of water and the water is al ways moving past. So, when you look down it’s not the same water that you would’ve  seen five seconds ago or five minutes or five days ago.

Yuka says “There are no hard feelings on either sid e.” “To have hard feelings” means to have anger or resentment about a situation  or a person. “No hard feelings” means that you’re not thinking about how this other person acted, or whether they may have insulted or hurt you. “No har d feelings” means I’m not mad at you. “Please don’t be mad at me” could also be a way of interpreting that expression. Yuka says “There are no hard feelings o n either side,” meaning neither she nor Jamal is angry at the other.

Andy says, “You told me that the breakup was mutual .” A “breakup” is when you end a romantic relationship, usually a boyfriend/gi rlfriend relationship. You could also use the term, however, for a marriage. “They b roke up their marriage.” They ended their marriage. They got a divorce. So, break up could be used in that case, too.

Andy says that Yuka told him that their breakup was  mutual. Something that is “mutual” (mutual) is something done by two people. You both agree. “The feeling is mutual” is another expression we have. That mean s “I feel the same about that person as that person feels about me.” It could be a positive thing. It could be a negative thing. “Mutual” just means something done by two people or done at the same time. Andy is saying that although Yuka told h im that their breakup was mutual, he always thought that Yuka still had a sof t place in her heart for him.

“To have a soft place in your heart for someone” me ans, really, that you still have kind feelings toward someone, possibly even romanti c feelings. It’s not always romantic. You could have a soft place in your heart  for your nephew or for your grandmother, but it might be also romantic in some instances, when you’re talking, of course, about situations where that’s l ikely.

Andy then thought that Yuka may have still liked Ja mal. Yuka says, “The truth is, when we first broke up, I did harbor some hopes of the two of us getting back together again.” “To harbor” (harbor) means to continue to have hop es about something or fears about something. It could be a positive or a negati ve, but to keep those feelings a secret from other people. Yuka had these hopes righ t after Jamal and she first broke up, “But that never came to pass,” she says. For something to “come to pass” means for something to happen. “Never come to  pass” means something did not happen, did not occur.

 Yuka says that she and Jamal both moved on. “To mov e on” means to continue with your life, not to worry about some past event or not to let it affect your decisions about what you’re doing right now. When t wo people breakup in a romantic relationship, it’s usually better for both  of them to move on, to find another boyfriend or another girlfriend, or a dog. Dogs sometimes can be much better companions, much better friends than a boyfr iend or a girlfriend.

Well, Yuka says that she and Jamal moved on and tha t she wishes him well. “To wish someone well” means to hope that that person h as a good life, to have good feelings towards that person, to want that person t o be happy.

Andy says, “Well, how was the wedding?” Yuka said, “It was very nice and Jamal’s new wife seems to be a good match for him.”  “To be a match” (match) here means to have some of the same characteristics , some of the same interests that the other person has or simply to be  a good fit, to be two people that are good together, they’re good for each other . They’re a good match. Andy says, “And you didn’t mind seeing them together?” m eaning “It didn’t bother you to see your ex-boyfriend with his new wife?” Yuka s ays, “Not at all, especially after I met Lorenzo.”

Now we find out why Yuka is not angry about going t o Jamal’s wedding, because she has a new boyfriend named Lorenzo. In English, Lorenzo is “Lawrence,” which some of you may know is my middle name, but I  am not dating Yuka. I want everyone to know that -  especially my wife!

Andy says, “Lorenzo, huh? You’ve been holding out o n me.” “To hold out on someone” is not to give that person all the informa tion that you have, to keep some things secret, not to tell the person everythi ng you know. Andy says, “Do tell.” This is a somewhat old-fashioned phrase, mea ning that you want the other person to give you the information, the (usually) e xciting or interesting news that they have to tell you. “Do tell” – “Please tell me”  is what that expression means.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Andy:  What did you do last weekend?

Yuka:  I went to Jamal’s wedding.

Andy:  Jamal?!  Your ex Jamal?

 Yuka:  Yes, that Jamal.

Andy:  He had the nerve to invite you to his weddin g?

Yuka:  I actually thought it was nice of him to inv ite me.  Whatever happened between us years ago is water under the bridge.  Th ere are no hard feelings on either side.

This episode is a dialog between Rita and Rick, abo ut buying and selling stocks. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Rita:  I just got a hot tip from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.

Rick:  Your brother works for McQ Corp., doesn’t he ?

Rita:  Yeah, he’s a director in the company, so he should know if something big is brewing.

Rick:  If he’s a director and he knows something th at isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he’s telling you to buy stoc k, isn’t that insider trading?

Rita:  Insider trading?!  I’m not a major investor.   I don’t plan to buy so many shares that I’ll become a major shareholder.  All I  can afford are a few shares.

Rick:  Still, he’d be considered a corporate inside r and may be breaching his fiduciary responsibilities.  Giving you this tip co uld get him, and you, into a lot of trouble.

Rita:  Who are you, an SEC regulator?  People do th is kind of thing all the time, and there’s nothing shady about it.  If you’re smar t, you’d buy a few shares yourself.

Rick:  Uh, no thanks.  I don’t think I’d look good in an orange jumpsuit.

[end of dialog]

Rita begins by saying to Rick, “I just got a hot ti p from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.” A “tip” (tip) is advice, information tha t will help you. A “hot tip” is typically a tip about some piece of information tha t’s very timely that you need to do something about right away. This is often a term  that we use when we’re talking about secret information – in this case, the information is about buying stock. “Stock” (stock) is partial ownership in a co mpany. You can buy stock in what’s called a “stock market.” You could buy stock  in a big company like Microsoft or Apple or any other of the large compan ies. They all sell stock and you can go and buy a little piece of that company.

Rita then has a hot tip about buying stock in McQ C orp. Rick sys, “Your brother works for McQ Corp. doesn’t he?” Rita says, “Yeah. He’s a director in the company.” A “director” is a member of the company’s , the corporation’s “board of directors.” This is a group of people – men and wom en – who make important decisions about the company, all the most important  decisions, including who to hire as the president. They are made by the Board o f Directors. Rita’s brother is on the Board of Directors of McQ Corp.

Rita says, “He should know if something big is brew ing.” The expression “something big is brewing” (brewing) means that som ething important is going to happen but no one knows exactly what it is. It’s se cret information. “Something big is brewing.”  Rick says, “If he’s a director an d he knows something that isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he he’s t elling you to buy stock, isn’t that insider trading?” Rick is saying that if Rita’ s brother is on the board of directors of McQ Corp. and he knows something that isn’t publicly disclosed, then there’s a problem. “Publicly” means that everyone k nows about it. “Disclosed” means that you tell someone. So, if you “publicly d isclose (disclose) information,” you announce it to everyone. You tell the newspaper , you tell the television stations, “This is what’s happening in my company.”

In the United States, there are very strict, very s pecific rules that you have to follow as a company. You can’t be buying and sellin g your stock based on information that you don’t tell everyone else about . That’s exactly what is happening here. Rita’s brother is using his informa tion that hasn’t been publicly disclosed to tell his sister to buy stock. That is what we call “insider trading.” “Trading” refers to buying and selling stocks. “Ins ider” (insider) refers to someone who is inside of or part of an organization or grou p, in this case, a corporation, a company. “Insider trading” is when you take the inf ormation you have about your company and you buy and sell stocks, even though no  one else knows that information. That is against the law in the United States if the company is what is called “publicly traded;” that is, if anyone can go  and buy stock in that company.

Rita says “Insider trading? I’m not a major investo r.” An “investor” (investor) is someone who “invests” (invest). “To invest” means t o buy stock in a company or to buy something that you think will be worth more money in the future. You can be a real estate investor. You could buy buildings and houses, hoping that the price goes up. By the way, that doesn’t always happ en.

Rita says she’s not a “major investor.” “Major” (ma jor) here means a very important one or a large investor. She says, “I don ’t plan to buy so many shares that I’ll become a major shareholder.” “Shares” are  what we call the individual units of stock. A “shareholder” is someone who owns  shares. So, “shareholder” here really means the same as “stockholder” – someo ne who owns shares, who owns stock in a specific company. Rita says, “All I  can afford” – all I have money for – “are a few shares” – just a couple pieces of stock, if you will. Rick says, “Still, he’d be considered a corporate insider” – h e, being Rita’s brother – “and may be breaching his fiduciary responsibilities.” We already talked about what an “insider” is. “Corp orate” (corporate) is something related to a corporation – a large compan y, in this case. So, a “corporate insider” would simply be someone who wor ks at a large company or a corporation. Rick says that Rita’s brother would be  considered a corporate insider and may be – possibly – breaching his fiduc iary responsibilities. “To breach” (breach) means to break or violate or to do  something wrong with regards to, in this case, responsibilities that you  have. If you’re on the board of directors of a publicly traded corporation, you hav e fiduciary responsibilities. “Fiduciary” (fiduciary) involves the trust that the  company has given to you, as it relates to money or investments. So, “fiduciary” is  usually a term we use when we’re talking about money and your responsibilities  as someone who has information about a company or about an individual.

Rick says, “Giving you this tip could get him” – Ri ta’s brother – “and you, into a lot of trouble.” You could possibly be breaking the  law here. Rita says, “Who are you, an SEC regulator?” “SEC” stands for the Securi ties and Exchange Commission. This is the U.S. government agency that  is responsible for regulating, for making sure that people in the stoc k market are doing what they are supposed to, are following the law. A “regulato r” (regulator) is a person who works in a government agency, a government organiza tion that is responsible for going out and making sure people are following the rules. In this case, the rule is related to buying and selling stocks.

Rita says, “People do this kind of thing all the ti me and there’s nothing shady about it.” “Shady” (shady) means dishonest, not com pletely honest. There’s something that you’re hiding. There’s something tha t you aren’t supposed to do that you are doing. That’s the adjective “shady.” W e might say, “He’s a shady

character,” meaning he’s not an honest person. He’s  not someone you should trust. There’s something strange about that person.  That’s what people say about me. Rita says, “If you’re smart, you’d buy a few sh ares yourself.” So, Rita says there’s nothing wrong with this.

Rick says, “No thanks, I don’t think I’d look good in an orange jumpsuit.” A “jumpsuit” (jumpsuit) is a piece of clothing that c overs your entire body, from your shoes up to your neck, from your ankles to your nec k. You would, perhaps, see someone who works on automobiles – a mechanic – mig ht be wearing a jumpsuit to protect his clothing underneath. However, we als o put prisoners – people who are in jail, people who have been arrested because they’ve broken the law – in jumpsuits. And it’s become common in recent years t o put them in a very bright- colored jumpsuit so in case they escape, they are e asy to catch. And the color that is often used is orange. So, when Rick refers to an orange jumpsuit, he’s talking about someone who would be arrested. He thi nks that what Rita is recommending is against the law and he doesn’t want  to go to jail.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Rita:  I just got a hot tip from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.

Rick:  Your brother works for McQ Corp., doesn’t he ?

Rita:  Yeah, he’s a director in the company, so he should know if something big is brewing.

Rick:  If he’s a director and he knows something th at isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he’s telling you to buy stoc k, isn’t that insider trading?

# Planning a Children¡¦s Party

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 861: Planning a Children’s Party.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 861. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com Become a member of ESL Po dcast, and download the Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is a dialog between Sara and Paul, who  are planning, who are getting ready for a party, for some children. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialog]

Sara:  Come on!  We need to buy all of the things w e need for Gabriel’s party before the store closes.

Paul:  Are you sure we need a party?  Maybe we can just have a cake and some party hats.

Sara:  Are you kidding?!  We are going to pull out all the stops.  We’ll have streamers, balloons, noisemakers, and party favors.   This is going to be really fun.

Paul:  I don’t even know if he’d like all that.  Wh at are you doing?

Sara:  I’m getting lots of confetti to throw when w e sing “Happy Birthday.”

Paul:  The confetti is going to get all over the ic e cream and the icing on the cake.  And it’ll be a nightmare to clean up.

Sara:  Don’t worry about the clean up.  I’ll take c are of that.  Now, where are the goodie bags...

Paul:  Are you sure all of this is necessary?

Sara:  Of course, it is.  Ooo...What do you think o f hiring a clown and renting an inflatable castle for the party?

Paul:  You do remember that Gabriel is turning one,  don’t you?

Sara:  So? ...

It’s just as I suspected.  Some birthday parties ar en’t for the children.  They’re for the adults who never grew up!

[end of dialog]

Sara says to Paul, “Come on.” “Come on” is an expre ssion we use when you want someone to leave with you or you want them to perhaps work a little faster. Sara says, “Come on. We need to buy all of the thin gs we need for Gabriel’s party before the store closes.” In this case, Sara wants Paul to leave with her, to go to a store so they can buy things for Gabriel’s party, whoever Gabriel is.

Paul says, “Are you sure we need a party? Maybe we can just have a cake and some party hats.” A “cake” (cake) is a type of dess ert, a sweet bread-like dessert that you have at parties – birthday parties, gradua tion parties, parties for someone’s wedding – all of these would probably hav e some sort of cake involved. Paul says, “Maybe we can just have a cake  and some party hats.” “Party hats” are colorful paper hats that you wear on your head, usually associated with parties for young children. Sara sa ys, “Are you kidding?” meaning “Are you joking?” She’s surprised at what P aul is saying, and maybe a little angry.

She says, “We are going to pull out all the stops.”  This expression, “to pull out all the stops” or “all of the stops,” means you’re goin g to do everything you possibly can. You’re not going to limit yourself in anyway. You’re going to do the most you can. The expression actually comes from playing the  organ. “To pull out all the stops” is to make the organ play at its loudest pos sible volume, although I’m not a musician so don’t take my word for that. You may not want to believe what I say.

Sara says, “We’ll have streamers, balloons, noisema kers and party favors.” These are all things you might find at a children’s  party or some other kind of party in some cases. “Streamers” (streamers) are lo ng pieces of brightly colored paper that you hang on the wall or hang on doors or  put on the windows. “Balloons” are small pieces of rubber that are fill ed with air and you can fill them with water if you want to have a water balloon figh t, but I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about filli ng them with air in order to decorate or make a room look more festive, more lik e you’re having a party.

“Noisemakers” are little devices that are used to m ake a lot of noise that you would find again at a children’s party because youn g children like to make a lot of noise. If you don’t believe me, just ask my neighbo rs. “Party favors” are little gifts that you give people for coming to your party. That ’s a party “favor” (favor).

Sara says, “This is going to be really fun.” Paul s ays, “I don’t even know if he’d like all that.” He’s not even sure if Gabriel will like all of this planning – all of these things that Sara wants to do for the party. Paul th en asks, “What are you doing?” Sara says, “I’m getting lots of confetti to throw w hen we sing happy birthday. “Confetti” (confetti) are small pieces of paper. Th ey could be white, they could be colored, that are used often to throw at people in celebration. You will sometimes see confetti at someone’s wedding, as they’re comin g out of the church. You can throw either rice or confetti. So, it’s an item tha t you would associate with a party. Paul says, “The confetti is going to get all over t he ice cream and the icing on the cake.” Paul is complaining these little pieces of p aper, if you throw them up into the air, will “get all over,” meaning they’ll get i nto, the ice cream. “Ice cream” is a sweet frozen dessert, usually made from milk and su gar, maybe fruit and other sweet things that you would like to eat. I remember  when I was growing up, those one or two times that I had a birthday party, we wo uld have chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream, which is a white-colored ice  cream. Those were always the most popular flavors for ice cream at a party. Nowa days, they have ice cream in all different kinds of flavors, all different kinds  of taste, but back in the old days, it was basically chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

Paul thinks the confetti will get all over the ice cream and the icing on the cake. When you have a cake, you usually put a thick color ed substance made of butter or some other substance as decoration on top of the  cake. So, the cake itself is baked in an oven and after you take it out of the o ven and let it cool, you’ll put some sugary, buttery substance on the top of it tha t will make it even sweeter and that will give it some particular color. You ca n often write someone’s name in icing that goes on the cake for the birthday party.  Paul says, “It’ll be a nightmare to cleanup.” A “nightmare” (nightmare) normally mea ns a bad or scary, or frightening dream that you have, but in this case, it just means a very bad situation, a very bad experience. Sara says, “Don’t  worry about the cleanup.” Don’t worry about cleaning up after the party.

Sara says, “Now where are the goodie bags.” “Goodie  (goodie) bags (bags)” are little bags, kind of like party favors, that have l ittle gifts for the people who come to the party. Once again, it’s something you would probably find more at a children’s party. When you have a birthday party for your son or daughter, and you invite other children to come, the children – e ven if it’s not their birthday – will also get a little gift from you, who is hosting or who is having the party.

 Paul says, “Are you sure all of this is necessary?”  Do we really need to do this? Sara says, “Of course it is. Ooo… What do you think  of hiring a clown and renting an inflatable castle for the party?” A “clown” (clo wn) is a person who dresses in very brightly colored clothing, usually with big sh oes and a red nose and tries to make people laugh. We associate clowns with childre n’s birthday parties. Some parents who have way too much money to spend will h ire a clown to come to their child’s party in order to entertain the child ren, to get them to laugh, to have a good time.

An “inflatable castle” is something you used to onl y find at a big carnival or a big fair, a big celebration in your community or in you r town. Nowadays, however, parents sometimes get inflatable castles for their child’s birthday. An “inflatable castle” is a large plastic structure in the shape o f a castle. A “castle” is where a king or a queen would live, of a country, that’s fi lled with air so that children could go inside of this plastic thing and bounce up and d own inside of it. I have no idea how much these cost. As I said, it used to be you w ould only see them at a big celebration in your neighborhood or in your town an d now, parents, with again way  too much money to spend on their children, get the se for their children’s parties. So, some company comes over and they put o ne of these inflatable castles in the front of your house and all the neig hborhood children will come to the party and play inside of this castle.

Paul says, “You do remember that Gabriel is turning  one, don’t you?” “Turning” here means having a birthday and becoming one year older. So, I could say, for example, “I’m turning 30 this year.” That means thi s year I will have my 30 th birthday – just an example, of course. Paul thinks that Sara is having a big party that is really unnecessary since Gabriel, their son , is only one year old. He won’t even be able to understand what’s going on. Paul en ds the story by saying, “It’s just as I suspected.” It’s just as I thought. “Some  birthday parties aren’t for the children. They’re for the adults who never grew up. ” “Grew (grew) up” is the past tense of “grow (grow) up,” which means to become an  adult, to no longer be a child. Paul is saying that the birthday party isn’t  for Gabriel. He’s only one year old. He doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s for Sara  – an adult who has never quite grown up herself.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Sara:  Come on!  We need to buy all of the things w e need for Gabriel’s party before the store closes.

 Paul:  Are you sure we need a party?  Maybe we can just have a cake and some party hats.

Sara:  Are you kidding?!  We are going to pull out all the stops.  We’ll have streamers, balloons, noisemakers, and party favors.   This is going to be really fun.

Paul:  I don’t even know if he’d like all that.  Wh at are you doing?

Sara:  I’m getting lots of confetti to throw when w e sing “Happy Birthday.”

Paul:  The confetti is going to get all over the ic e cream and the icing on the cake.  And it’ll be a nightmare to clean up.

Sara:  Don’t worry about the clean up.  I’ll take c are of that.  Now, where are the goodie bags...

Paul:  Are you sure all of this is necessary?

Sara:  Of course, it is.  Ooo...What do you think o f hiring a clown and renting an inflatable castle for the party?

Paul:  You do remember that Gabriel is turning one,  don’t you?

Sara:  So? ...

It’s just as I suspected.  Some birthday parties ar en’t for the children.  They’re for the adults who never grew up!

# Getting a Massage

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 862: Getting a Massage.

This episode is a dialog between Robert and Staci a bout getting a massage, when someone touches you physically in order to rel ax your muscles. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Robert:  Why are you twisting your back like that?

Staci:  I’m in pain.  My back and shoulders really hurt.  I think it’s from sitting at this computer all the time.

Robert:  What you need is a good massage.  It can g et rid of the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief.

Staci:  I don’t know.  I don’t like the idea of get ting naked in front of a stranger.

Robert:  If you’re skittish about that, remember th at you’ll be covered with a sheet, except for the part that he or she is workin g on.  It’s not a big deal.

Staci:  But what if they’re too rough with me?  It might make things worse.

Robert:  An experienced massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t like wha t he or she is doing.

Staci:  Do you think a massage could really help me ?

Robert:  Definitely.  I recommend my massage therap ist.  She’s licensed and very good.

Staci:  She doesn’t use smelly oils or play hokey m usic during the massage, does she?

Robert:  No, she doesn’t.  She’s very professional,  without being too clinical, if you know what I mean.  Call her!

Staci:  I’ll think about it – ouch!

Robert:  Call her right now.  You don’t have a minu te to lose!

[end of dialog] Our dialog begins with Robert asking Staci, “Why ar e you twisting your back like that?” “To twist” (twist) means to turn something, to move part of something in one direction while the other thing is in a differe nt direction. “To twist your back” – the back of your body – would mean to move the top of your body, for example, in one direction, to the left, while the rest of yo ur body remains straight. That would be to “twist your back.” Staci says, “I’m in pain” – I hurt – “my back and shoulders really hurt. I think it’s from sitting at  this computer all the time.” Staci is sitting at her computer all day and she says it is causing pain in her back.

Robert says, “What you need is a good massage.” A “ massage” (massage) is where someone touches your skin and your muscles in  order to relax you. Robert says a massage can “get rid of the knots in your mu scles and get you some pain relief” or give you some pain relief. “Knots” (knot s) in this case refer to tight sections in your muscles that are causing you pain,  usually because you’re very tense, you’re very stressed. You have a lot of thin gs you are worried about, perhaps. That could cause knots in your muscles, pa in that can best be relieved by massaging the knots, by taking your hand or some one else taking their hand and trying to get those out of your muscles by putt ing pressure on them, by rubbing them. Your muscles, you probably know, are the parts of your body that help move your bones back and forth. “Pain relief” (relief) is a reduction or a lessening in the amount of pain, the amount that so mething hurts you. Robert says, “A good massage can get rid of” – meaning can  eliminate – “the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief.”

Staci says, “I don’t know. I don’t like the idea of  getting naked in front of a stranger.” “To be naked” (naked) is to be without a ny clothes on. I am usually not naked when I record these episodes. I’m just kiddin g. I’m never naked when I’m recording these episodes. “To be naked in front of a stranger” means that you have no clothes on and you are in front of someone you do not know. That’s what a “stranger” is.

Well, Staci doesn’t want to get naked in front of a  stranger. The reason she says that is because typically, when you get a body mass age, you go somewhere and you have to take your clothes off. If you don’t tak e your clothes off, the person giving the massage has no way of easily touching yo ur skin in order to relax your muscles.

Robert says, “If you’re skittish about that, rememb er that you’ll be covered with a sheet.” “To be skittish” (skittish) means to be ner vous about something, to be uncomfortable about something. Heather is very skit tish about going to see a doctor because she doesn’t like the sight of blood.  She doesn’t like looking at blood, that red stuff that comes out of your body i f you put a hole in your skin. Robert says to Staci, “If you’re skittish about get ting naked in front of a stranger, remember that you’ll be covered with a sheet.” A “s heet” is a piece of cloth that you put normally on top of a bed. When you are slee ping on it, you put sheets on it so that you’re not sleeping directly on the actu al bed. You have this piece of cloth, this piece of fabric, that you sleep on that  you can take off and wash easily.

When you get a massage, you’re typically covered wi th a cloth, a towel or a sheet that covers your body, except the part where the person giving you the massage is working. Robert says, “It’s not a big de al,” meaning it’s nothing you should be worried about. Staci says, “But what if t hey’re too rough with me? It might make things worse.” “To be rough” (rough) mea ns to use too much pressure, to be too strong in the movements, not to  be gentle, not to be “tender,” we might say. Staci says that she’s worried about t he person giving the massage being too rough with her. She says, “It might make things worse.”

Robert says, “An experienced massage therapist will  ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t  like what he or she is doing.” A “massage therapist” (therapist) is a pers on whose job it is to provide massages, to give you a massage. In many places, ma ssage therapists have to get a license from the government in order to work.  Robert says “The massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you w ant.” “Pressure” (pressure) is how strong they will press against your body with t heir hands, basically.

Robert says, “You can speak up if you don’t like wh at he or she” – the massage therapist – “is doing.” “To speak up” is a two-word  phrasal verb meaning to say something to the person who is in charge when you’r e not happy with something, when you don’t like something, when you want to cha nge something. A teacher might tell her students, “If you have any problems with your homework, you need to speak up – you need to say something so that I k now.”

Staci says, “Do you think a massage could really he lp me?” Robert says “Definitely. I recommend my massage therapist.” Rob ert has his own massage therapist that he is suggesting that Staci use as w ell. Robert says, “She’s licensed and very good.” “Licensed” means that she has a license (license), which is official permission, usually from the gove rnment, that allows you to say that you’re a massage therapist, in this case, and work as one in that particular area. Robert says that his massage therapist is lic ensed.

Staci says, “She doesn’t use smelly oils or play ho key music during the massage, does she?” “Oil” (oil) is a thick liquid that massa ge therapist will sometimes put on your body in order to make it easier to rub your  muscles. “Smelly” (smelly) is something that has a not very pleasant smell or odo r, something that stinks, something that has a bad smell. Staci is worried th at the massage therapist will use oils that are smelly, that don’t have a good sm ell to them. She’s also worried that the therapist will play hokey music. “Hokey” ( hokey) is something that is, we might say, overly emotional or sentimental, somethi ng that has too much emotion in it. In this case, it would be music that’s suppo sed to relax you but you might think is kind of silly or kind of stupid. Sometimes  massage therapists try to relax the people that they are working on by playing musi c but if it’s silly music, if it’s hokey music, you may not like it. That’s what Staci  is afraid of here.

Robert says, “No she doesn’t. She’s very profession al, without being too clinical, if you know what I mean.” “To be clinical” (clinica l) would be almost like a doctor, someone who only uses evidence and science to do wh at they’re doing. Robert is saying that the massage therapist is not too cli nical, meaning she’s not like a doctor, in this case. She’s going to help you relax . “If you know what I mean,” is an expression that we use or a phrase that we use t o mean the other person probably understands what you’re trying to say even  though you haven’t explained it very well.

Robert says, “Call her.” Staci says, “I’ll think ab out it. Ouch!” “Ouch” (ouch) is the sound we make when something hurts us, when we’re i n pain.  We say “Ouch!” Sometimes you would say other words as well when yo u’re in pain. Robert says, “Call her right now. You don’t have a minute to los e.” The expression “You don’t have a minute to lose” means that you have to do so mething immediately, right away. If you don’t, then your situation will be muc h worse.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Robert:  Why are you twisting your back like that?

 Staci:  I’m in pain.  My back and shoulders really hurt.  I think it’s from sitting at this computer all the time.

Robert:  What you need is a good massage.  It can g et rid of the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief.

Staci:  I don’t know.  I don’t like the idea of get ting naked in front of a stranger.

Robert:  If you’re skittish about that, remember th at you’ll be covered with a sheet, except for the part that he or she is workin g on.  It’s not a big deal.

Staci:  But what if they’re too rough with me?  It might make things worse.

Robert:  An experienced massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t like wha t he or she is doing.

Staci:  Do you think a massage could really help me ?

Robert:  Definitely.  I recommend my massage therap ist.  She’s licensed and very good.

Staci:  She doesn’t use smelly oils or play hokey m usic during the massage, does she?

Robert:  No, she doesn’t.  She’s very professional,  without being too clinical, if you know what I mean.  Call her!

Staci:  I’ll think about it – ouch!

Robert:  Call her right now.  You don’t have a minu te to lose!

This episode is a dialog between Toshi and Celeste,  about freedom of speech. Let’s get started

[start of dialog]

Toshi:  You can’t go outside looking like that!  Wh at are you thinking?

Celeste:  I’m exercising my right of free speech.  I’ve put on these clothes and painted my body this way to protest the treatment o f women.  I want to send a message.

Toshi:  You’re crazy if you think people are going to take you seriously.  What you’re wearing is offensive and those messages pain ted on your body are hate speech.

Celeste:  It’s my basic human right to a freedom of  expression, and this is how I choose to express myself.

Toshi:  There are limits to free speech and express ion, and you’ve crossed the line.  In fact, you’re abusing those rights.  Obsce nity and hate speech aren’t protected, you know.

Celeste:  If you feel so strongly about it, I have a suggestion for you.

Toshi:  What?

Celeste:  You can express your free speech by prote sting against me.  After all, it’s your inalienable right.

Toshi:  I’m not wasting my time.  Hey, you’re not r eally going outside looking like that, are you?

Celeste:  You know what they say:  The medium is the message.  And I’m sending my message loud and clear!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Toshi saying to Celeste, “Yo u can’t go outside looking like that! What are you thinking?” We’re not sure what C eleste looks like but Toshi doesn’t like it. Celeste says, “I’m exercising my r ight of free speech.” “To exercise” (exercise) here means to use, usually to use your abilities or your rights or your privileges to do something. The verb “to ex ercise” is often used with the word “right” or “”rights” in referring to your abil ity to do things that you are legally allowed to do.

“The right of free speech” is the legally protected  ability that you have to give your opinion, to express your ideas in public. Of c ourse, that’s not always true in every situation. In general, that’s the meaning of the term “free speech” – the ability to say what you want. “Free” here doesn’t m ean the opposite of “expensive” or having to pay for it. It means that you have the freedom that you are allowed to say what you want. That’s what we me an by “free speech.”

Celeste says, “I’ve put on these clothes and painte d my body” – put colored paint on her body – “this way to protest the treatment of  women.” “To protest” (protest) means to fight against something, to express your d isagreement of something, usually in public. Celeste says, “I want to send a message,” meaning I want to communicate my opinion, my ideas to someone else -  in this case, to people who see her at this protest that I guess she’s goin g to.

Toshi says, “You’re crazy if you think people are g oing to take you seriously.” “You’re crazy” means that you have lost your mind, that you are not thinking properly. “You’re crazy if you think people are goi ng to take you seriously,” Toshi says. “To take someone seriously” means to consider  what another person is doing or saying, and thinking that it’s a serious m essage. You don’t think that they’re silly or stupid or foolish. “To take someth ing seriously” can also mean to treat it as though it is an important thing, not ju st to ignore it or to think, “Oh, that’s not important.”

Toshi says, “What you’re wearing is offensive and t hose messages painted on your body are hate speech.” If something is “offens ive” (offensive) it’s something that is insulting. It hurts other people’s feelings . It might be rude. It might make

other people mad or upset. All of those things coul d be considered “offensive.” “Hate speech” is a relatively new idea that words t hat express very bad, negative things about other people because of certain charac teristics they have, should somehow be treated differently than other opinions.  So, there’s “free speech,” which is the freedom to say what you want. Now peop le, some people, talk about “hate speech,” which are things that you should not  be allowed to say because they are so offensive to other people.

Celeste says, “It’s my basic human right to freedom  of expression.” The term “human right” refers to something that everyone sho uld be allowed to do, no matter where you are, where you live, what governme nt you have. That would be a human right. Not everyone agrees on what those ri ghts are, but most people believe that there are things such as human rights that everyone should have. Celeste believes that one of her “basic” – one of h er fundamental, one of her most importan – human rights is “freedom of express ion.” “Freedom of expression” is just another word for freedom of spe ech.  “This is how I choose to express myself.” “Expression” can actually mean a l ittle bit more than just speech, in the sense of “words.” “Expression” might  also include your actions or, in this case, how you dress – or don’t dress.

Toshi says, “There are limits” – there are restrict ions – “to free speech and expression, and you’ve crossed the line.” The phras e “to cross the line” means to go too far, to go beyond what you are allowed to do  or what you should do. Toshi says, “In fact, you’re abusing those rights.” “To a buse” (abuse) means to use something for the wrong purpose, perhaps, to use to o much of something or to hurt someone in some way that you do not have the r ight to do, that you should not do. Toshi thinks that Celeste is abusing her ri ght of free speech.

He says, “Obscenity and hate speech aren’t protecte d you know?” “Obscenity” (obscenity) refers to words, images, or actions tha t are considered very rude, very offensive, especially when it refers to sex or  sexuality. “Obscenity” is one of those things that is very difficult to define. Ther e has been a debate in the United States for many years about what obscenity is. One of the famous quotes from the Supreme Court – one of the justices on the Supr eme Court – about what obscenity is and how to define it, was, “I know it when I see it.” In other words, he couldn’t give a definition of obscenity but he knew  what obscenity was when he saw it. A lot of people were not very happy with th at definition but that’s what he said.

“Obscenity and hate speech,” Toshi says, “aren’t pr otected.” “Protected” means that the law allows you to do something – that the law prevents you from being punished because of your actions, in this case, you r speech. Toshi says that

“Obscenity and hate speech aren’t protected,” meani ng you’re not allowed to do that and call it free speech. Celeste says, “If you  feel so strongly about it” – if you have such a strong opinion about it – “I have a sug gestion for you.” Toshi says, “What?” Celeste says, “You can express your free sp eech by protesting against me. After all, it’s your inalienable right.”

“Inalienable” (inalienable) is something that canno t be taken away from a person. The word was famously used in the Declaration of In dependence, written by Thomas Jefferson, saying that the American colonies  were no longer going to be part of Great Britain, that the colonists – the peo ple who lived in the American colonies – had “inalienable rights,” rights that Gr eat Britain could not take away from them. Jefferson named three – life, liberty (o r freedom), and the pursuit of happiness – the right to be able to find things tha t make you happy.

Toshi says, “I’m not wasting my time. Hey, you’re n ot really going outside looking like that, are you?” Celeste says, “You know what t hey say: The medium is the message. And I’m sending my message loud and clear. ” The phrase “the medium is the message” was used famously by the Can adian writer and philosopher Marshall McLuhan back in the 1960’s to mean that the way that a message is delivered affects its meaning, that a me ssage changes depending on how the message is communicated, how it is delivere d. That’s a very simple explanation of what McLuhan was talking about. Cele ste says, “The medium is the message,” meaning I’m going to send a message b y the way I’m dressed. She says she’s sending her message “loud and clear. ” “Loud and clear” means everyone can understand it. There’s nothing hidden.  It’s easy to understand.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Toshi:  You can’t go outside looking like that!  Wh at are you thinking?

Celeste:  I’m exercising my right of free speech.  I’ve put on these clothes and painted my body this way to protest the treatment o f women.  I want to send a message.

This episode is a dialog between Karla and Joaquin,  about going to school to get a university degree in business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Karla:  I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school. Is that right?

Joaquin:  Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a l ong time, and have finally taken the plunge.  I need an MBA to get ahead in my caree r.

Karla:  That’s great, but why don’t you go part-tim e?

Joaquin:  I had considered taking classes on nights  and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Iv y League school, and I want to take full advantage of the opportunities there.

Karla:  Isn’t graduate school expensive, especially  an Ivy League school?

Joaquin:  Yeah, but I think it’s worth it, and I’ve  been saving up.  I have an undergraduate degree in accounting and finance, but  that’s not enough if I want to work in the upper echelons of this or any other company.

Karla:  I graduated with a degree marketing and inf ormation systems.  Maybe I should be thinking about getting an MBA.

Joaquin:  I’d recommend it, if you want to go furth er in your career.  I’ll lend you all of my test prep materials for the GMAT.

Karla:  The GMAT?  I’d forgotten about the GMAT.  T hat may be a deal breaker for me.

Joaquin:  Why?  You don’t like taking tests?

Karla:  I like taking tests as much as I like getti ng a kick upside the head – maybe even less!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Karla saying to Joaquin, “I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school.” A “leav e of absence” (absence) is a period of time when you leave your job but are allo wed to come back to your job when you finish doing whatever you are leaving your  job for. Some people may take a leave of absence because a family member is sick or they might take a leave of absence, as Joaquin is doing in the dialog , to go back to school and study some more. Not all companies allow you to tak e a leave of absence and typically, you’re not paid during your leave of abs ence. So, it has to be a situation that is either very serious or very important for y ou.

Joaquin is going to take a leave of absence to go t o business school, usually that means going to get a graduate degree after you’ve a lready completed your undergraduate, bachelor’s degree. Joaquin says, “Ye ah, I’ve been thinking about it for a long time and have finally taken the plung e.” The expression “to take the plunge” (plunge) means to decide to do something th at is perhaps a little scary, a little risky. You’re not sure what is going to happ en but you’re just going to go ahead and do it because you decide that the benefit s are going to be greater than the costs; that is, it will help you more than  it will hurt you. Joaquin says, “I need an MBA to get ahead in my career.” An “MBA” is  a Masters of Business Administration. That’s an advanced degree that prov ides education for people who are in business or who want to go into the busi ness world but need more education about topics such as finance, marketing, management, and other areas.

Karla says, “That’s great, but why don’t you go par t-time?” “Part-time” would be going to school but also doing something else. So, you may be working full-time – eight hours a day – and then at night, you may be  going to school part-time. Joaquin wants to go to school full-time. He wants t o quit his job and only go to school, or at least, go to school for most of the d ay and perhaps have a part-time job at night. Joaquin said “I had considered” – I h ad thought about – “taking classes on nights and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Ivy League school and I want to take full a dvantages of the opportunities

there.” The “Ivy (Ivy) League (League)” is a group of private colleges that are considered among the best colleges in the United St ates. There are, traditionally, eight Ivy League colleges – Columbia University, Br own, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Penn sylvania. So, Joaquin must be very smart and have a lot of money to get admitt ed into or accepted into an Ivy League school as a student.

Karla says, “Isn’t graduate school expensive, espec ially at an Ivy League school?” So immediately Karla asks the question tha t the average person would ask, which is, “Wow, how can you afford that?” “How  can you have enough money?” “Graduate school” is any university educati on you receive after your bachelor’s degree that usually leads to a master’s degree or a Ph.D. or doctorate in some topic. Joaquin says, “Yeah, but I think it’ s worth it and I’ve been saving up.” “To save up” is a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to be saving your money for a specific or particular purpose. Maybe you dec ide not to buy a new car because you want to save up to buy a new house. You  want to save your money. So, “to save up” is usually when we save our money for a specific purpose.

Joaquin says, “I have an undergraduate degree in ac counting and finance but that’s not enough if I want to work in the upper ec helons of this, or any other company.” An “undergraduate degree,” we referred to  earlier, is usually called a bachelor’s degree. It’s something that you get afte r studying at least four years at the university, or in my case, seven years, because  I wasn’t very intelligent. You see, it took me a long time.

“Accounting” is the activity of making sure you kee p good records of how much money you bring into the company and how much you s pend. It’s an organized, what we might describe as “systematic” way of keepi ng track of or knowing how much money you’re getting and how much money you’re  spending. “Finance” is when you are managing a large amount of money for a n organization – making sure that the organization has enough money. That w ould be part of finance.

Joaquin has a bachelor’s degree – an undergraduate degree – in accounting and finance, so he knows something about business. But he says, “That’s not enough” – that’s not sufficient – if he wants to wo rk in the “upper echelons” of his company. The “upper echelons” (echelons) refers to the very top of a large organization or company. The presidents, the vice p residents, the top managers – we would call them the top “executives” who work in a company. They are part of the upper echelon.

Karla says, “I graduated with a degree in marketing  and information systems.” “Marketing” is the area of a company or a business,  responsible for letting other

people know about your products, of trying to get p eople to buy your products by, for example, having advertising. That might be part  of the marketing department in a company. “Information systems” is the part of the company that is responsible for the computer technology, especially  how this information is used to help organize and run the company. That’s inform ation systems – a relatively new part of business in the last 50 years or so.

Karla says, “Maybe I should be thinking about getti ng an MBA.” Joaquin says, “I’d recommend it” – I think it’s a good idea – “if  you want to go further in your career” – in other words, if you want to get a bett er and higher-paying job in the future. Joaquin says, “I’ll lend you all of my test  prep materials for the GMAT.” So, Joaquin is going to let Karla use his “test pre p” materials. “Test prep” is short for “test preparation.” It’s the process of studyin g for a specific exam, learning what kind of questions will be asked, practicing yo ur answers – that’s part of test prep.

“GMAT” is the Graduate Management Admissions Test. This is the test that most business schools use in the United States for their  MBA programs. They give it to anyone who wants to go there, and you will need to get a certain score – a certain result – if you want to get into the school . The more difficult the school, the higher the GMAT score will be, the higher the G MAT score that you will need to get into that school. GMAT, like the SAT, like o ther similar tests, are used to decide who gets into the university and who doesn’t .

Karla says “The GMAT? I had forgotten about the GMA T. That maybe a deal breaker for me.” A “deal (deal) breaker (breaker)” is something that makes it impossible for you to do something because you don’ t want to do it or you can’t do it. For example, I wanted to go out on a date wi th this beautiful girl but she was a smoker. And that was a deal breaker for me. S he liked to smoke cigarettes and so I decide, “No. I could not date anyone who s moked cigarettes.” That’s not true, of course. When I was dating, I would date an y woman who would say “yes” to going out with me, to going on a date with me. B ut some people might consider smoking, for example, to be a deal breaker .

Joaquin says, “Why? You don’t like taking tests?” K arla says, “I like taking tests as much as I like getting a kick upside the head.” A “kick upside (upside) the head” is an expression used when you have done some thing foolish or stupid. It’s almost as though someone were punishing you by  kicking you in the head because you were so stupid. You were so dumb. Karla  says that she likes taking tests as much as getting a kick upside the head. In  other words, she doesn’t like it at all. And therefore, having to take this test – the GMAT – to go to graduate

school would definitely be a deal breaker. It would  be something that would make her decide that she was not going to do that.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Karla:  I just heard that you’re taking a leave of absence to go to business school. Is that right?

Joaquin:  Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a l ong time, and have finally taken the plunge.  I need an MBA to get ahead in my caree r.

Karla:  That’s great, but why don’t you go part-tim e?

Joaquin:  I had considered taking classes on nights  and weekends while I continue to work, but I’ve been admitted into an Iv y League school, and I want to take full advantage of the opportunities there.

Karla:  Isn’t graduate school expensive, especially  an Ivy League school?

This episode is a dialog between Armond and Patrici a about believing in people who say they can predict the future. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialog]

Armond:  I hope that this new year will bring me be tter luck.

Patricia:  You can find that out easily enough.  My  astrologer says...

Armond:  Hold on.  You consult an astrologer?  You really believe in that nonsense?

Patricia:  It’s not nonsense and, yes, I believe in  it.  I like getting predictions about the future and knowing what is in the stars for me.

Armond:  Astrologers are charlatans and what they t ell their customers is phony. They make it all up and tell people what they want to hear.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnings and helps me avoid mistakes.  And when I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading.  The guidanc e I get is invaluable.

Armond:  You’re too smart to be taken in by con art ists who style themselves as mystics.  It’s all smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  You’re wrong.  I’ll give you an example.   My horoscope today said that an unpleasant person will try to shake my beliefs.  It said I should just walk away.

Armond:  Hey, where are you going?

 [end of dialog]

Armond begins our dialog by saying “I hope that thi s new year will bring me better luck.” He hopes that good things will happen  to him this year. Patricia says, “You can find that out easily enough,” meanin g it’s very simple. It’s very easy to get that answer. “You can find that out eas ily enough,” she says. “My astrologer says…” An “astrologer” (astrologer) is a  person who studies the movements of the planets and the stars in the belie f that somehow that will help him understand people and be able to predict events  in the future.

Astrology has been around for thousands of years. P eople have always believed somehow that what is up in the sky somehow controls  what happens here on earth and apparently, there are still people today who believe such a thing. Armond says, “Hold on. You consult an astrologer?” “To consult” (consult) here means to get someone’s advice about something, to s eek someone’s guidance, to get their suggestions. In this case, it means to  talk to an astrologer and ask that person what the future will bring you – what w ill happen in your future.

Armond says, “You really believe in that nonsense?”  “Nonsense” is something that isn’t logical. It is not rational. You shouldn ’t take it seriously. It makes no sense. Patricia says, “It’s not nonsense and yes, I  believe in it. I like getting predictions about the future.” A “prediction” is a guess about what will happen in the future. Tomorrow it will rain. I predict that i t will rain tomorrow. That’s what I think will happen.

Patricia likes getting predictions about the future  which – in a way, you don’t really need to say about the “future” because a pre diction is always about something that will happen in the future. But she s ays she likes getting predictions about the future and “knowing what is i n the starts for me.” “In the stars” here means what is meant to happen in the fu ture. Once again, the idea is somehow that the stars and the planets are controll ing our lives.

Armond says, “Astrologers are charlatans and what t hey tell their customers is phony.” A “charlatan” (charlatan) is someone who pr etends to be very intelligent, who says they know a lot about something but is act ually not. A charlatan is someone who lies in order to make you think that th ey know something. There are lots of charlatans on the Internet, for example , about almost every topic.

Armond says that astrologers are charlatans and wha t they tell their customers – the people who pay them money – is “phony” (phony).  “Phony” is fake, not real, false, not true. “They make it all up.” “To make so mething all up” is to invent it, to

say something as if it were true when you really do n’t have any idea whether it is true or not. The astrologers make it all up and tel l people what they want to hear. Patricia says, “I don’t know how you can say that,”  meaning I don’t understand why you are talking that way or saying those things .

“The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnin gs and helps me avoid mistakes.” A “horoscope” (horoscope) is a predictio n or a description of what will happen to someone on a particular day and what they  should do about it. Horoscopes are based on or are determined, accordin g to astrologers, by when your birthday is and what the position of the stars  and the planets are. It’s a type of astrology. A lot of people like to read their ho roscope for their particular sign. Your “sign” refers to the 12 parts of what is calle d the “zodiac” (zodiac). Supposedly, this is an area where the stars and the  planets travel and they’re associated with a name and a symbol.

The calendar is divided up into 12 signs. Most peop le know their astrological sign even if they don’t believe in it. I was born in Sep tember and so I’m – late September – and so I’m a Libra. And then if you wer e born in a different month, you would be something else, one of the other 12 si gns of the zodiac. This again is part of this whole belief that somehow the stars  and the planets control us. Some people read their horoscopes just for fun. Mos t horoscopes are written so generally that they could probably be applied or it  would probably be true for almost anyone.

Patricia says, “When I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading.” A “reading” here means you go to this person, this as trologer, in this case, who will then predict what your future will be. Maybe they’l l look at your hands, your palms. Maybe they’ll look at some special cards. Ma ybe they’ll look at something else that’s supposed to help them predict what your  future will be. Patricia says when she has a big decision to make, she goes for a  reading. She goes to her astrologer. “The guidance I get” – the suggestions that she receives – “is invaluable,” meaning it’s worth a lot. It’s extreme ly valuable. It’s impossible to say how much because it is so valuable to you, so worth while to you.

Armond says, “You’re too smart” – you’re too intell igent – “to be taken in by con artists who style themselves as mystics.” Couple of  different expressions there – “to be taken in” means to be tricked or to be foole d by someone, for someone to lie to you and for you to believe it. That’s to be taken in. A “con artist” is a person who does something to trick you out of your money, to fool you into giving him your money. “Con” is short for “confidence,” basica lly, trust that you have in that person, that that person is able to get you to give  them. That’s what a con artist does.

 Armond says that Patricia is too smart to be taken in by con artists who style themselves as mystics. “To style (style) yourself a s something” means to present yourself in a certain way, to pretend that you are something that you really aren’t. In this case, the con artists are styling themselve s as mystics. A “mystic” (mystic) is a person who is very spiritual, who seems to hav e a close relationship with God and is somehow closer to the truth than other p eople. Armond says, “It’s all smoke and mirrors.” The phrase “smoke (smoke) and m irrors (mirrors)” is used to describe a situation where what appears to be happe ning is not actually happening. The idea is that you are being fooled. Y ou are being tricked. You are being lied to. A person is doing something to make you believe something that isn’t true. “It’s all smoke and mirrors,” Armond sa ys.

Patricia says, “You’re wrong. I’ll give you an exam ple. My horoscope today says that an unpleasant person” – someone who’s not very  nice – “will try to shake my beliefs” – to shake my confidence in my beliefs. “T o shake (shake) someone’s confidence in their beliefs,” or “to shake someone’ s beliefs,” we might say, means to make another person doubt what they previo usly had believed, to make them less certain about something. Patricia sa ys that her horoscope told her that she should “walk away,” meaning she should  leave when she finds or meets this unpleasant person. Of course, what does she do? She turns around and leaves. Armond says, “Hey, where are you going? ” – indicating to us that Patricia is walking away from Armond because that’s  what her horoscope told her to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Armond:  I hope that this new year will bring me be tter luck.

Patricia:  You can find that out easily enough.  My  astrologer says...

Armond:  Hold on.  You consult an astrologer?  You really believe in that nonsense?

Patricia:  It’s not nonsense and, yes, I believe in  it.  I like getting predictions about the future and knowing what is in the stars for me.

Armond:  Astrologers are charlatans and what they t ell their customers is phony. They make it all up and tell people what they want to hear.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnings and helps me avoid mistakes.  And when I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading.  The guidanc e I get is invaluable.

Armond:  You’re too smart to be taken in by con art ists who style themselves as mystics.  It’s all smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  You’re wrong.  I’ll give you an example.   My horoscope today said that an unpleasant person will try to shake my beliefs.  It said I should just walk away.

Armond:  Hey, where are you going?

# Using Renewable Energy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 866: Using Renewable Energy

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 866. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Carl and Jody, abo ut using energy wisely, using energy that is renewable. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Carl:  Uh!  What’s that smell?

Jody:  I’m working on my latest invention.  I’m tur ning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.

Carl:  Why?  There are already lots of types of ren ewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!

Jody:  Well, I think I’m onto a better alternative.   Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel.  That’s the wave of t he future.

Carl:  You mean you think that it would be more eff icient than wind power and solar energy?  There are geothermal and hydroelectr ic power plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.

Jody:  But I’m using food that would otherwise be w asted.

Carl:  I hate to break it to you, but if you want t o convert food into fuel, there are already different types of biofuels that work prett y well.

Jody:  You mean somebody has already beaten me to t he punch?

Carl:  Yes, and I bet they’ve found a way to do it without this stench!

[end of dialog]

 Carl begins by saying, “Uh! What’s that smell?” – w hat is that smell? Jody says, “I’m working on my latest invention.” An “invention ” (invention) is something that you create, that no one else has made before, somet hing you make that solves some problem or does something that no one else has  been able to do before. We might talk about the invention of the television  or the invention of the Internet. Jody is working on an invention – her “latest,” mea ning her most recent invention. She says, “I’m turning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.” Jody is “turning” their old food “into” som ething, meaning she’s changing it. “To turn something into something else” is to t ransform it, to change it. She’s taking their old food and making it into an energy source. An energy source is a way of getting or obtaining energy needed to run so me machine or to power some technology.

Jody is trying to create an energy source for their  car and their house. Carl says, “Why? There are already lots of types of renewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!” The word “renewable” (renewable) is something you can use again or something that will not run out. “Renewable energy” is energy that comes from some natural reso urce that will never run out, or would take a very long time to use up, like the energy of the sun, for example, or water energy or wind energy. These might all be called “renewable energy sources.”

Carl says “There are lots of renewable energy sourc es and none of them smell like this,” meaning none of them smell like Jody’s invention of using old food. Jody responds, “Well, I think I’m onto a better alt ernative.” “To be onto something” means I’ve discovered, I’ve found. An “a lternative” would be something you can use instead of, or in place of so mething else.

A bicycle is an alternative to your car – if you’re  travelling short distances, that is. It’s an alternative to your  car, perhaps, not my car! I still want to drive my  car. I’m not against using a bicycle, of course – every coup le of years.

Jody says, “I’m onto a better alternative. Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel.” “To recycle” (recycle) me ans to take something that has been used already for a purpose and to use it again , often by cutting it up or breaking it up in some way and then re-using – usin g again – the material from that object, from that thing. Jody is saying that s he can recycle unwanted fuel and turn it into fuel. “Fuel” (fuel) here really me ans the same as “energy.” Often we think of fuel as something that is burned in ord er to produce energy, but it could be used more generally to mean an energy sour ce.

Jody says, “That’s the wave of the future.” That ex pression “the wave (wave) of the future” means something that will become very p opular or something that will be normal in the future, not right now but someday soon. We use the word “wave” just like an ocean wave, which is water that  moves up and travels across a certain distance or seems to travel – the water i s pushed, of course. We use that idea of a wave in talking about how things wil l go into the future – they will be moving into the future in this direction. We might say, “The wave of the future is using mobile devices – telephones and tablets, iPad s, that sort of thing – instead of computers sitting on your desk.” That might be a  “wave of the future.”

Carl says, “You mean you think that it would be mor e efficient than wind power and solar energy?”  “Efficient” means it does somet hing in a smaller amount of time or that uses less money or fewer resources. “W ind energy,” or “wind power” as it’s called here, is the power or energy created  by the wind, usually using some large piece of metal that moves around in a ci rcle. We would call that a “windmill” (windmill). “Solar energy” is using ener gy from the sun, either to heat up water or to create electricity. In some parts of  the United States where there’s a lot of sun throughout the year, people have “sola r panels” – large pieces of material on their roofs in order to collect solar e nergy.

Carl goes on to mention a couple of other types of renewable energy sources. He says, “There are geothermal and hydroelectric power  plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.” “Geotherm al” (geothermal) refers to energy that you get from under the earth – from ins ide the ground, from a very hot area inside the ground. You are using that ener gy underground.

“Hydroelectric” refers to water that goes through a  small area called a “dam” and the pressure or power of the water turns engines, t urns these large pieces of metal – these wheels – which help create electricit y, combining them with the use of magnetic force, typically, I believe.

Jody says, “But I’m using food that would otherwise  be wasted,” meaning I’m using food that people are just going to throw away  or destroy. Carl says, “I hate to break it to you, but if you want to convert food  into fuel, there are already different types of biofuels that work pretty well.”  So, Carl is basically saying, “You’re kind of an idiot, Jody. We’ve already done these things.”

The expression “I hate to break (break) it to you” means “I don’t like to give you bad news but I’m going to tell you some bad news.” You might say to someone, “I hate to break it to you but you didn’t get the j ob. You were not hired.” You’re telling them news they don’t want to hear – bad new s. Carl says, “I hate to break it to you, but if you want to convert” – or change – “food into fuel” – or energy –

“there are already different types of biofuels that  work pretty well.” A “biofuel” (biofuel) is a fuel that is made from plants and an imals. It’s a kind of fuel that you can burn, typically, to create energy.

Jody says, “You mean somebody has already beaten me  to the punch?” “To beat someone to the punch (punch)” means to do something  before another person has the opportunity to do it.

So, you and your sister are thinking about buying y our mother a new set of dishes – something or her kitchen. You talk about i t and then your sister goes out and she buys the dishes for your mother and gives t hem to her, and you find out after talking to your mother that your sister gave her the dishes that you were going to give to her. So, you might say to your sis ter, “Oh, you beat me to the punch.” You did it before I had an opportunity to d o so. And now you’re mad at your sister because you don’t know what to get your  mother, because, you know, your mother is sometimes difficult to buy for. And so, when you have a good idea and your sister takes it, or your sister does it be fore you, you’re not very happy with your sister. I’m just speaking hypothetically.  This didn’t actually happen to me, of course.

So, Jody says, “You mean someone” – or somebody – “ has already beaten me to the punch?” Carl says, “Yes and I bet they found  a way to do it without this stench.” “Stench” (stench) is a very bad smell, a v ery unpleasant smell. Carl is saying that he thinks they have been able to do wha t Jody is trying to do without all of the bad smell.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Carl:  Uh!  What’s that smell?

Jody:  I’m working on my latest invention.  I’m tur ning our old food into an energy source for our car and our house.

Carl:  Why?  There are already lots of types of ren ewable energy that power cars and homes, and none of them smell like this!

Jody:  Well, I think I’m onto a better alternative.   Imagine being able to recycle your unwanted food into fuel.  That’s the wave of t he future.

Carl:  You mean you think that it would be more eff icient than wind power and solar energy?  There are geothermal and hydroelectr ic power plants that already provide energy for lots of homes and businesses.

# Talking About Attractive Men and Women

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 867: Talking About Attractive Men and Women

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 867. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode. You can also t ake a look on our website at our ESL Podcast Store which has some additional cou rses in business and daily English I’m sure you will enjoy.

This episode is a dialog between Pamela and David a bout how we might describe physically attractive men and women – not me, in other words. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Pamela:  You know that your tongue is hanging out o f your mouth, right?

David:  That’s because I’ve never seen so many beau tiful women in one place before.  Why have I never been to this beach before ?  Look at her!  She’s a hottie!

Pamela:  Isn’t that what you said about that woman over there?

David:  No, I said she’s a babe.  Look at the way s he sways when she walks.

Pamela:  Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or husban d is going to come over here.

David:  I’m not ogling.  I’m admiring the perfectio n of the female body.

Pamela:  You’re undressing her with your eyes.  Ave rt your gaze before you regret it.  Oh, wow!

David:  What?

Pamela:  Check out that guy over there.  Hello, Mr.  Tall, Dark, and Handsome!

David:  That pretty boy over there?  He’s too into himself.  Look at the way he’s posing so every woman on this beach can get a look at him.  He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.

Pamela:  And the women you’ve been ogling in the te eny tiny bikinis?

David:  Those women?  They’re just showing off what  God gave them!

[end of dialog]

Pamela begins by saying, “You know that your tongue  is hanging out of your mouth, right?” The expression “to have your tongue”  – which is, of course, inside of your mouth normally – “hanging out of your mouth ” means that you are sort of like a dog or an animal that sees food and, in reac tion to that, sticks his tongue out. The tongue comes out, indicating that he wants  that food – that he wants to eat that food.

Sometimes, this expression is used to describe men who see beautiful women or a beautiful woman and are sort of not aware that th ey are looking at them or that they are showing their interest in such an obvious way. Pamela is saying that about David. David says, “That’s because I’ve never  seen so many beautiful women in one place before. Why have I never been to  this beach before?”

So they are down by probably the ocean, or a lake t hat has a beach – a place, usually filled with sand, that people sit on in ord er to either sunbathe – that is, take in the sun and have it change the color of the ir skin, at least if they’re light- skinned like me – or to go swimming. And of course,  at beaches, people usually wear swimming gear or swimwear that reveals their b ody more than you would see almost anywhere else.

David says, “Look at her” – pointing to one particu lar girl – “she’s a hottie!” A “hottie” (hottie) is someone who’s very beautiful, very sexually attractive. Pamela says, “Isn’t that what you said about that woman ov er there?” David says, “No. I said she’s a babe.” A “babe” (babe) is a beautiful,  young, attractive woman. It really means the same as “hottie.” “Hottie” has a l ittle bit more of a sexual meaning. “Babe” is always a woman who’s very attrac tive. It’s a little older word – it was popular, I think, late 80’s and 90’s, a litt le less popular now but you’ll still hear it.

David says, “Look at the way she sways when she wal ks.” “To sway” (sway) means to move your body from side to side. And, of course, a woman walking

down the street may sometimes sway her body natural ly from side to side and men often find that attractive, in the way that a w oman might be walking.

Pamela says, “Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or h usband is going to come over here.” “To ogle” (ogle) – which some people might p ronounce “oogle” like “Google,” but “ogle” is the standard pronunciation – means to look at someone, usually a man looking at a woman, but it could be t he other way around, with a strong sense of sexual attraction. You’re staring a t them. You’re looking at them for what would be considered too long of a period t o be polite. It might make the other person even uncomfortable, the way you are lo oking at them because you find them so beautiful, so attractive. That’s why P am tells David to stop ogling her. Stop looking at her that way, or if he doesn’t , the woman’s boyfriend or husband may come over here and, of course, not be v ery happy that David is looking at his girlfriend or wife.

David says, “I’m not ogling. I’m admiring the perfe ction of the female body.” I’m just admiring the beauty, her physical beauty. Pame la says, “You’re undressing her with your eyes.” “To undress” means to take you r clothes off. It’s the opposite of “to dress.” “To undress a person” – someone – “w ith your eyes” means that you are looking at that person who has clothes on, but you’re imagining them without their clothes. I think you understand what I’m saying here. That’s what David is doing according to Pamela. He’s not lookin g at this woman as some sort of work of art. He’s looking at her in a very sexua l way.

Pamela says, “Avert your gaze before you regret it. ” “To avert” (avert) means to avoid or to turn away. Your “gaze” (gaze) is your l ook. You’re looking at someone. You’re gazing at someone. “Avert your gaze ,” means to turn your eyes away from someone. Don’t look at something. We migh t say this if it’s something particularly ugly or negative or violent. In this c ase, we’re saying it to David because he might get in trouble if he keeps looking  at this beautiful woman who obviously has a man with her.

Then Pamela says, “Oh, wow.” David says, “What?” Pa m says, “Check out that guy over there.” “Check out” here is a two-word, ph rasal verb, meaning to look at and pay attention to someone or something. “Check o ut this new television show,” you might say to someone, and show them on y our television what you’re talking about. “Check out that guy” means look at t hat man over there.

“Guy” usually, in the singular, refers to a man. “G uys” (guys) – plural – can refer to a group of men or it could refer to a group of m en and women. So it depends on how you use it. A lot of people will say, “Hey g uys! How’s it going?” – referring to both men and women. But if you say, “He’s with a  guy,” you mean he’s with a

man, not a woman. So, “guy,” in the singular, is us ually a man. “Guys” can be men or men and women.

Getting back to the story then, Pamela is looking a t some guy – some man – and she says, “Hello Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome.” The  expression “tall, dark, and handsome” describes the perfect man that many women  are looking for – a man who’s tall, a man who has perhaps dark skin and dar k eyes – although, of course, not all women like men with dark skin and d ark eyes, fortunately for me, since I have neither. “Handsome” (handsome) is a wa y of describing a man who’s very physically attractive. A good looking ma n would be described as “handsome.” We wouldn’t typically use handsome to d escribe a woman or a girl. Usually, it’s just for a boy or a man.

David says, “That pretty boy over there? He’s too i nto himself.” A “pretty boy” (pretty) boy is a man who takes care of his physica l appearance, who probably spends a lot of time and money on his hair and on h is clothing. Some men, of course, think that other men who do that are someho w too much concerned about their physical appearance. A real man doesn’t  worry about how his hair looks – that would be the idea. I don’t worry about  how my hair looks, for example. “Pretty boy” is used here, somewhat, as an  insult to this man. “He’s too into himself,” David says. “To be into yourself” me ans to be very interested in what you are doing, in your appearance, almost to t he point of being very selfish or self-centered. “I only care about me” – that’s t he idea behind this phrase, “to be into yourself.”

David says, “Look at the way he’s posing so every w oman on the beach can get a look at him.” “To pose” (pose) means, here, to po sition your body in a particular way, usually for a photograph so that you appear mo re beautiful. You may turn one way or another – turn your face or your head fr om one side to another. That would be to pose. This man is posing, according to David, so that all the other women on the beach can look at him.

He says, “He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.” An “e xhibitionist” (exhibitionist) is someone who wants to be noticed by other people, wh o does things so that other people pay attention to him or her. Some people eve n go so far as to take off part of their clothing so that other people will notice them. That’s usually the connection we have to this word. An exhibitionist i s often someone who will try to get other people to pay attention to them by taking  their clothes off.

Pamela says, “And the women you’ve been ogling in t he teeny tiny bikinis?” Pamela is saying that the women that David has been  looking at are also exhibitionists because they have “teeny tiny bikini s.” A “bikini” (bikini) is a small,

“two-piece” we would call it, bathing suit for wome n. The top part of the bathing suit goes around a woman’s chest or breasts and the  bottom part goes where she would wear a pair of underwear. “Teeny tiny” me ans very small. So, these bikinis are not very big, relative to the women who  are wearing them. That is, you can see a lot of their skin.

David says, “Those women? They’re just showing off what God gave them.” “To show off” is a two-word, phrasal verb meaning to ma ke something visible to other people so they can admire it, so they can see how b eautiful it is. We can also use this expression when we tell people things about ou rselves that we want to impress them with. “Oh, I just won a Nobel Prize in  literature, didn’t I tell you?” You are showing off. You are telling other people a bout your accomplishments or you’re showing them something physically that you w ant them to admire. You want them to say, “Oh, well that’s very beautiful,”  or “That’s very impressive. Congratulations on your Nobel Prize for literature. ”

“What God gave someone” is a phrase that we use to describe your natural abilities or your physical appearance. So when Davi d says that the women are just showing off what God gave them, he’s saying th at the women are just showing the world the gifts, if you will, that God has given them in creating their beautiful bodies. I think that’s what David is tryi ng to say here.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time, at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Pamela:  You know that your tongue is hanging out o f your mouth, right?

David:  That’s because I’ve never seen so many beau tiful women in one place before.  Why have I never been to this beach before ?  Look at her!  She’s a hottie!

Pamela:  Isn’t that what you said about that woman over there?

David:  No, I said she’s a babe.  Look at the way s he sways when she walks.

Pamela:  Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or husban d is going to come over here.

David:  I’m not ogling.  I’m admiring the perfectio n of the female body.

Pamela:  You’re undressing her with your eyes.  Ave rt your gaze before you regret it.  Oh, wow!

 David:  What?

Pamela:  Check out that guy over there.  Hello, Mr.  Tall, Dark, and Handsome!

David:  That pretty boy over there?  He’s too into himself.  Look at the way he’s posing so every woman on this beach can get a look at him.  He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.

Pamela:  And the women you’ve been ogling in the te eny tiny bikinis?

David:  Those women?  They’re just showing off what  God gave them!

Let’s get started.  [start of dialog]  Marisol:  What do you think of the big announcement this morning?  Lamar:  That our company is going to merge with McQ Corp.?  From what I’ve heard through the grapevine, this isn’t a merger but a hostile takeover.  Marisol:  But the CEO said this morning that our company and McQ Corp. are equals in this merger, and the integration of the two companies will be seamless.  Lamar:  Don’t you believe it!  McQ Corp. has a history of taking over companies with high valuations and a lot of assets and selling it off in pieces.  This is no friendly acquisition.  Marisol:  But what about all of that talk about our two companies consolidating into a strong business entity and creating great synergy?  Didn’t you buy any of that?  Lamar:  Not one word.  When McQ Corp. is through with us, we’ll be lucky to still have the shirts on our backs!  [end of dialog]  Marisol begins by saying to Lamar, “What do you think of the big” – or important – “announcement this morning?” An “announcement” is when you are given some piece of news, usually from someone in authority, like your boss or the president of the United States. Lamar says, “That our company is going to merge # Touring Celebrity Homes and Filming Locations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 869: Touring Celebrity Homes and Filming Locations.

This episode is about taking a tour – going around and looking at – celebrity homes here in beautiful Los Angeles. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialog]

Tour guide:  Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody.   I’m your tour guide for today, and I’ll be showing you some of the most mem orable locations in Hollywood history.  Every seat in this double-decke r bus is a good one, and you’ll be able to see every landmark we drive by.  Uh, do you have a question?

Elvira:  Yes, I do.  When do we see the celebrities ?  I want to get my picture taken with a real Hollywood star!

Tour guide:  Well, we’ll be stopping at some celebr ity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity.  I’ll also be  taking you to some filming locations where classic and well-known movies were filmed on location.

Elvira:  Yes, but can we go to some celebrity hango uts?  I really want to meet Johnny Depp.

Tour guide:  I’m not sure...

Elvira:  If I saw a Johnny Depp or any celebrity wa lking down the street, I would just go crazy!  For sure I’d chase them down!

Tour guide:  This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus and i t would be really dangerous to run out into L.A. traffic.

Elvira:  Oh, what’s a little danger if I can come f ace to face with a real life movie star?

[end of dialog]

We begin the dialog with the tour guide, the person  who leads a group of people as the travel around and look at things, visit plac es that might be interesting for someone who is not from that part of the world or f rom that area. This is a case of a tour guide here in Los Angeles, here in Hollyw ood. “Hollywood” is just one part of the city of Los Angeles. It’s not its own c ity. It’s just what we would call a neighborhood, a section of the city of Los Angeles,  although the word really gets used to describe the entire industry, the entire bu siness of making movies and television shows and other things here in Southern California. The tour guide says, “Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody.” You can actually take a tour here in Los Angeles that will drive you around to f amous places. This is one of those tours.

The tour guide says, “I’m your tour guide for today  and I’ll be showing you” – I’ll be taking you to – “some of the most memorable loca tions in Hollywood history.” “Memorable” (memorable) is something that is easy t o remember, usually because it’s very exciting or very interesting. The  guide says that “Every seat in this double-decker bus is a good one.” A “double-de cker (decker) bus” is a bus that has two stories or two levels. These are most famously found in London, in England, where you’ll see the double-decker buses.

I’ve ridden in double-decker buses once or twice. T hey’re very popular for tours because you can put a lot of people in the same amo unt of space. You can put people on the bottom and people on the top. For mos t of the Hollywood tour buses, the top floor or level of the bus is open; t hat is, there’s no roof over it. So if it’s a sunny day, you’re going to get a lot of sun,  and if it’s a rainy day, well, you probably want to go down to the first level.

The tour guide says that “You’ll be able to see eve ry landmark we drive by.” A “landmark” (landmark) is some structure, object, lo cation that is somehow important, that is typically connected with somethi ng special – perhaps it was a special historical event, perhaps it was a famous m ovie, maybe a famous person died here or someone was born there. You can go and  visit the houses where famous people may have lived. Those could be consid ered landmarks. Or you could go to, say, the capital of our country, Washi ngton D.C., and see the big monuments and memorials, the statues. These could a ll be considered landmarks, especially when they’re found at places where something important happened.

 Someone has a question – Elvira. Elvira says, “When  do we see the celebrities?” This is a question that everyone who comes to Los A ngeles wants to know the answer to – Where are the celebrities? A “celebrity ” (celebrity) is a very famous person, usually a singer, an actor, an athlete, a p odcaster – well, most of those would be celebrities. Elvira wants to get her pictu re taken with – she wants to take a picture with her standing next to a real Hol lywood star. A “star” is like a celebrity, usually an actor, an actress who’s very popular in a movie or a television show.

The tour guide says, “Well, we’ll be stopping at so me celebrity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity. ” “To catch a glimpse” (glimpse) means to get a very brief, quick look at something or someone without seeing it very well. So, you see someone walking down the str eet and they’re walking very fast and you just get a quick glimpse of them. You just get a glimpse of what they look like. You don’t see them very well because the y go by so quickly. The tour guide says, “Maybe we’ll catch a glimpse.” Notice t he verb “to catch (catch)” a glimpse. You could also say “get a glimpse” of some thing or someone.

The guide says, “I’ll be taking you to some filming  locations.” A “filming location” is anywhere where they used the area for a movie or  a television show. Here in Los Angeles, there are filming locations everywhere , and they use different parts of the city to make movies and television shows, in cluding my neighborhood, where I live. You will often see a film crew – a gr oup of people making a movie. You know they’re there because they’re blocking the  streets and you can’t drive around there and I really hate that. But it’s part of living in this city – living in Los Angeles.

Other parts of the city have filming locations more  frequently. Downtown Los Angeles is often – parts of it are often closed bec ause they are filming. The tour guide says that they’re going to go where some clas sic and well-known movies were filmed “on location.” The expression “on-locat ion” means they were filmed right there. They weren’t filmed back in what we ca ll a “studio” (studio), which is a place where you would normally make a movie or a te levision show, that’s inside a large building. They would actually, when you fil m on location, they will go to the place that is in the script – that is, in the s tory or that represents some place in the story. So they’ll go to a real house or they ’ll go to a street and they will film there, not inside of a studio.

Elvira says, “Yes but can we go to some celebrity h angouts?” A “hangout” (hangout) is a place where you spend a lot of time,  in a casual informal way, just having fun, not working – just enjoying yourself. I t can also be a verb, “to

hangout.” “I’m going to hang out with my friends.” That means I’m going to go spend time with my friends. As a noun, a hangout is  a place where people go to have fun.

Elvira wants to go to some celebrity hangouts. Are there celebrity hangouts? Yes, there are. There are restaurants and hotels an d bars where a lot of celebrities go – not me, but a lot of celebrities d o. I’ve seen celebrities here in Los Angeles many times but usually at the grocery s tore or at the pharmacy or at the post office, not very exciting places.

Elvira says that she really wants to meet one celeb rity – Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp, you may know, is a famous actor, probably mos t famous for his role in the Pirates of the Caribbean  – those movies. The tour guide says that he’s not sure. Elvira interrupts – stops him from speaking – and s ays, “If I saw Johnny Depp or any celebrity walking down the street, I would just  go crazy.” She would be so happy. She would “go crazy,” go wild.

“For sure” – meaning I’m absolutely sure – “I would  chase them down.” “To chase someone down” means to follow someone who is moving away from you until you reach them, until you catch them. Maybe t hey’re trying to escape from you. Maybe they don’t know that you are behind them . Elvira would chase down any celebrities she saw walking down on the street.  I do not recommend that, however here in Los Angeles. You could have the pol ice at your hotel door soon after.

The tour guide says, “This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus.” “To hop-on” means to get on a bus. “To hop-off” means to get off the bus. A “hop-on, hop-off bus,” however, is a special kind of tour bus that many ci ties have where you pay one amount of money for the whole day, typically, and t hat bus will go around in a circle to a lot of different famous places that tou rists will want to see. And you can get on the bus, it will take you to another place, and then you can get off, visit that place, go back, get on the bus again. That’s a  hop-on, hop-off bus.

The tour guide says, “It would be really dangerous”  – not safe – “to run out into L.A. traffic.” “To run out” would mean to walk out where the cars are. “L.A.” is, of course, Los Angeles and “traffic” refers to the car s going back and forth on the street. Elvira says, “Oh, what’s a little danger if  I can come face to face with a real life movie star?” “What’s a little danger” mea ns it’s not important if it’s unsafe, if it’s dangerous, because the reward, the benefit, would be so great. “I would come face to face,” meaning I would meet some one personally – that person standing right in front of me – with a real life celebrity. “Real life” means

real, actual. It’s just a way of emphasizing. When someone says “real life,” they mean real, someone who is actually that thing, in t his case, a movie star.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Tour guide:  Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody.   I’m your tour guide for today, and I’ll be showing you some of the most mem orable locations in Hollywood history.  Every seat in this double-decke r bus is a good one, and you’ll be able to see every landmark we drive by.  Uh, do you have a question?

Elvira:  Yes, I do.  When do we see the celebrities ?  I want to get my picture taken with a real Hollywood star!

Tour guide:  Well, we’ll be stopping at some celebr ity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity.  I’ll also be  taking you to some filming locations where classic and well-known movies were filmed on location.

Elvira:  Yes, but can we go to some celebrity hango uts?  I really want to meet Johnny Depp.

Tour guide:  I’m not sure...

Elvira:  If I saw a Johnny Depp or any celebrity wa lking down the street, I would just go crazy!  For sure I’d chase them down!

Tour guide:  This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus and i t would be really dangerous to run out into L.A. traffic.

Elvira:  Oh, what’s a little danger if I can come f ace to face with a real life movie star?

This episode is a dialog between Joan and Roberto, about using caffeine, what people often have in their coffee to keep them awak e, as a stimulant. Let’s get started. > Joan:  Hi, how are you?  What are you doing?  What is this?
> Roberto:  Whoa!  You’re very high-strung this morni ng.
> Joan:  Am I?  I am a little wired.  I’ve been up al l night trying to finish an assignment for one of my classes.
> Roberto:  You don’t seem tired at all for having be en up all night.  In fact, you seem to be bouncing off the walls.
> Joan:  What are you trying to imply?  Sorry, I didn ’t mean to snap at you.  I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee and energy drinks.  I  still have a lot of caffeine in my system.
> Roberto:  That’s for sure.  You seem agitated from too many stimulants.
> Joan:  Well, I needed to stay awake, so as soon as I felt drowsy, I’d have another dose of caffeine.  It gave me an instant jolt!
> Roberto:  But you’re done with your assignment now,  right?
> Joan:  Yes.
> Joan begins our dialog by saying to Roberto, “Hi, h ow are you? What are you doing? What is this?” Roberto says, “Whoa! You’re v ery high-strung this morning.” “Whoa” (whoa) is just an expression of em otion, when you’re surprised about something. Joan seems to be very excited.  Sh e’s coming in and she starts asking all of these questions – “Hi, how are you? W hat are you doing? What is this?” That’s why Roberto says, “Whoa!” – often sai d as well when we want someone to slow down, to speak slower.

Roberto says to Joan, “You’re very high-strung this  morning.” “To be high- (high) strung (strung)” means to have a lot of tension, a lot of anxiety, someone who is not relaxed, someone who is very tense – a young ch ild, for example, who’s always jumping up and down and yelling and running around and all the things my neighbor’s children do. We might describe those children as being high- strung. Joan says, “Am I?” Am I high-strung? “I’m j ust a little wired,” she says. “Wired” (wired) here means you have a lot of energy , a lot of excitement, usually because you are using some sort of drug or medicine  that is making you very excited, very “energetic,” we might say.

Joan says, “I’ve been up all night trying to finish  an assignment for one of my classes.” “To be up all night” means to stay awake throughout the entire night. You never go to bed. You never go to sleep. Joan is  obviously a typical student who has waited until the very last day to finish he r homework. In this case, she calls it an “assignment,” which is basically someth ing you’re required to do for your classes.

Roberto says, “You don’t seem tired at all.” You do n’t seem even a little bit sleepy or tired. “In fact, you seem to be bouncing off the walls.” The expression “to bounce (bounce) off the walls” means again to h ave a lot of energy, to be very active – almost too active, like you can’t quite co ntrol yourself. “To bounce” is to take an object like a ball, throw it down on the gr ound or against a wall, and have it come back to you. We talk about bouncing a baske tball, for example. Well, the expression “to be bouncing off the walls” means tha t you’re like a ball that is hitting one wall and then it bounces. It hits anoth er wall and it bounces. It doesn’t stop moving. It’s very active.

Joan says, “What are you trying to imply?” “To impl y” (imply) means to say something indirectly, not in a direct way, to sugge st something but not to say it specifically or in detail. “He implied that I wasn’ t doing my work.” He didn’t say to me, “You’re not doing your work,” but he made other  comments, he made other statements that gave me the idea that that was he w as really trying to tell me. Joan is asking what Roberto is implying by his comm ents that she seems to be bouncing off the walls.

Then she apologizes, since the expression or the qu estion, “What are you trying to imply?” is often one someone will use when they think the other person is criticizing them. She says, “Sorry. I didn’t mean t o snap at you.” “To snap (snap) at someone” means to say something to someone in an  angry way – when you are mad, when you are upset – without thinking abou t it first. If you’re tired, you might sometimes snap at your husband or snap at you r wife or snap at your children because you’re not thinking. You get angry  with them and before you can really think about it, you say something negati ve to them.

Joan says, “I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee and energy drinks.” “Energy drinks” are drinks that have ingredients that are supposed to keep you awake and give you more energy. These are very popular among, for example, college students, who are always going out and drinking and partying and then when they have to do their schoolwork, they have to stay up all night  just like Joan did. So, they have these energy drinks.

The most common ingredient – the most common thing you will find in these drinks – is caffeine. And that’s what Joan says, “I  still have a lot of caffeine in my system.” “Caffeine” (caffeine) is a chemical substa nce found in coffee, in black tea, in certain kind of sodas, in chocolate, that g ives a lot of people energy when they consume it, when it enters into their body. I drink coffee now, every day. For a while, I was just drinking tea but now I’ve switc hed back to coffee and I have caffeine in my coffee. In the morning, I like to ha ve a cup of coffee and that caffeine wakes me up a little – gets me going.

The expression “to be in your system” means the sam e as to be in your body. The chemicals are still in your body and they’re af fecting you still. Roberto says, “That’s for sure.” Yes, you do have a lot of caffei ne in your system, he’s saying. “You seem to be agitated from too many stimulants.”  “To be agitated” (agitated) means to be nervous, to be excited, perhaps to be a  little upset, with a lot of extra energy – similar to being wired, except agitated ca n often be something negative, when someone is upset about something. “Stimulants”  (stimulants) is any food, medicine, or chemical substance that makes your bod y more alert, more active,

that allows you, for example, to stay awake longer.  Caffeine is a kind of stimulant but there are other chemical stimulants as well.

Joan says, “Well, I needed to stay awake.” “To stay  awake” means not to fall asleep, not to allow yourself to fall asleep. Remem ber, Joan was staying up all night to finish her homework. She says, “As soon as  I felt drowsy, I’d have another dose of caffeine.” “Drowsy” (drowsy) is ver y sleepy, very tired. It means you’re almost falling asleep. “I feel really drowsy ” or “I am very drowsy” – that means you’re just about to fall asleep. I hope none  of you are feeling drowsy right now. I’ll try to keep you going, wake you up.

Our next expression will help do that. It’s a “dose  of caffeine.” “Dose” (dose) is usually a word we use in medicine, talking about the mount of medicine you should take at a certain time. So, if the doctor gi ves you some pills to take, he may say, “Take two of these pills every morning.” T hat is your dose. That is the amount of medicine you’re supposed to take. Well, a  “dose of caffeine” would be an amount of caffeine that will keep you wake.

Joan says, “It gave me an instant jolt.” “Instant” means suddenly, immediately, something that happens right away. A “jolt” (jolt) is a large and sudden increase in energy or enthusiasm or, sometimes, activity. So  someone says, “I’m going to give you a jolt.” I’m going to give you a lot of en ergy, get you moving again. We often use the word with another type of stimulant –  “a jolt of caffeine,” “a jolt of adrenaline,” which is sort of your body’s natural w ay of getting you excited, getting you energized. That’s a jolt.

Roberto says, “But you’re done with your assignment  now, right?” You’re finished with your homework. Joan says, “Yes.” Robert says, “And you have a few hours before your class. So, why don’t you get some sleep ?” He’s suggesting that Joan sleep for a few hours until her class begins. Joan says, “Sleep? Sleep?! I don’t know the meaning of the word.” This expression – “I  don’t know the meaning of the word,” or of sleep, in this case – is used to s how that what that person is talking about, that word or phrase, isn’t applicabl e to you. It doesn’t apply to you. You can’t really understand it. We use it as a joke , this expression. When we say, “I don’t know the meaning of the word ‘work’,” that  would be someone who is making a joke, saying that they’re very lazy, that they don’t like to work. They don’t even know what work is. That’s the idea. I’m a little like that.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of story]

Joan:  Hi, how are you?  What are you doing?  What is this?

Roberto:  Whoa!  You’re very high-strung this morni ng.

Joan:  Am I?  I am a little wired.  I’ve been up al l night trying to finish an assignment for one of my classes.

Roberto:  You don’t seem tired at all for having be en up all night.  In fact, you seem to be bouncing off the walls.

Joan:  What are you trying to imply?  Sorry, I didn ’t mean to snap at you.  I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee and energy drinks.  I  still have a lot of caffeine in my system.

Roberto:  That’s for sure.  You seem agitated from too many stimulants.

Joan:  Well, I needed to stay awake, so as soon as I felt drowsy, I’d have another dose of caffeine.  It gave me an instant jolt!

Roberto:  But you’re done with your assignment now,  right?

Joan:  Yes.

Roberto:  And you have a few hours before your clas s, so why don’t you get some sleep?

Joan:  Sleep?  Sleep?!  I don’t know the meaning of  the word!

This episode is a dialog between Anastasia and Josh ua, about going somewhere to listen to a specific kind of dance music. Let’s get this party started.

[start of dialog]

Anastasia:  This is the best club in the city.  Gra ce brought me here last month. You’re going to love it.

Joshua:  What?!

Anastasia:  You’re going to love this club.  It has  the best DJ in town. She spins the best mixes.

Joshua:  Did you say you’re going to get us some mi xed drinks?

Anastasia:  No, I said that this DJ is great.  She plays music that gets people pumped up.  Oh, I love this song. It samples from t wo of my favorite songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.

Joshua:  Did you say that you want to buy this CD?

Anastasia:  No, I said I like this song.  It’s got a pounding beat and I can really feel the music. I love dancing to it.  Do you want to get out onto the dance floor?

Joshua:  Let’s wait until she segues into something  mellower.  I don’t really like dancing to this kind of club music.

Anastasia:  What?!  You love club music?  That’s gr eat.  Let’s go dance!

Joshua:  I think I’ll sit this one out.  Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here?

Anastasia:  What?!  You want the music to be louder ?  I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up.

Joshua:  No!

[end of dialog]

Anastasia begins by saying to Joshua, “This is the best club in the city.” A “club” (club) in this case refers to a dance club, a build ing with a large open area where people can dance and listen to music – usually mode rn music that is easy to dance to or, at least, some people think it’s easy to dance to. I do not.

Anastasia says, “Grace brought me here last month. You’re going to love it.” Joshua, however, is having difficulty hearing Anast asia because it’s so loud in the dance club. This, of course, is quite common. T hey play their music very loud and it’s very difficult to talk to someone. So, Jos hua says, “What?” because he didn’t hear Anastasia. Anastasia repeats herself. S he says, “You’re going to love this club. It has the best DJ in town.”

A “DJ” is a disc jockey. That’s the person who deci ded which songs are going to be played and in what order. You’ll often find a DJ  on a radio station or at a dance club like this. Anastasia says the DJ “spins the best mixes.” “To spin” (spin) here means specifically to play recorded mus ic, to be a DJ in a club. “Spin” can also mean to move something around in a circula r way and of course, in the old days, when we used to play these vinyl things c alled “records,” they would spin around in a circle. Even your CD’s, your compa ct discs, did that. Now, with MP3’s and other kinds of digital music, nothing has  to spin around physically, but we still use this verb “spin.”

This DJ, according to Anastasia, spins the best mix es. A “mix” (mix) is when you take two or more songs and you combine them togethe r so that it’s almost like one song. Joshua says, “Did you say you’re going to  get us some mixed drinks?” “Mixed (mixed) drinks” have nothing to do with mixe s like recorded songs. A “mixed drink” is a drink with alcohol and some othe r liquid like juice, coffee, or cream. Often it has a sweet taste, though not alway s. It’s a kind of alcoholic drink that you would find in a dance club for adults like  this.

Anastasia says, “No. I said that this DJ is great.”  In other words, Joshua isn’t understanding what Anastasia is saying. He thought she said something about

getting mixed drinks, when in fact, she was talking  about spinning mixes. Anastasia says the DJ plays music that gets people pumped up. “To be pumped (pumped) up” means to be excited, to be enthusiasti c, to be ready to do something.

Pump up the jam, pump it up…

That’s a line from a dance song from, I don’t know,  many years ago. “Pump up the jam.” “The jam” is probably just the music ther e – the mix.

Pump up the jam, pump it up…

That’s what dance music is like. You can tell why I ’m not a very good dancer. Anyway, Anastasia says, “The music gets people pump ed up.” “Oh I love this song,” she says. “It samples from two of my favorit e songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.” “To sample” (sample) here means to take a small part of a song and create a new song with it. So, it’s simila r to a mix but usually, when you’re sampling, you’re just taking a very small pa rt, maybe just ten seconds or so from another song and making it part of a new so ng. That’s what sampling involves. Sampling usually has a new song that is c ombined with an older song or part of an older song.

This particular song that Anastasia loves is one of  her favorite songs. “It’s my favorite track in this CD.” We talk about one song on a compact disc or one song on an old record album as being a “track.” We also use the term now for MP3’s on iTunes, for example. You can have a track. A “tr ack” (track) is one song.

Joshua says, “Did you say that you want to buy this  CD?” Notice again, Joshua is just not understanding what Anastasia is saying bec ause it’s so loud in that particular place. Anastasia says, “No. I said I lik e this song. It’s got a pounding beat and I can really feel the music. I love dancin g to it.” A “pounding beat” is a very strong rhythm in a song, especially for dancin g. If you go to a dance club, that’s pretty much all you can hear. It’s that poun ding beat that people use in order to dance to help them dance, I guess. It’s pr obably a combination of the alcohol and the pounding beat that gets them to dan ce.

Anastasia says to Joshua, “Do you want to get out o nto the dance floor?” “To get out onto” means to go, in this case, to a place whe re you can dance. The “dance floor” is part of the area in the dance club where everyone goes to dance. They, of course, also have tables in the dance club, for people to sit and drink and try to talk to beautiful women who don’t want to talk to y ou.

Joshua says, “Let’s wait until she” – the DJ – “seg ues into something mellower.” “To segue” (segue) means to transition or move from  one thing to another, very smoothly, without any breaks or any pauses. It’s so rt of a more formal word. You wouldn’t expect it to be used in a dance club, but there it is. The DJ is going to segue into something, Joshua hopes, that is more me llow, that is “mellower” (mellower). Something that is mellower is something  that is calmer, that is more relaxing, that is not quite as exciting or loud.

Joshua says, “I don’t really like dancing to this k ind of club music.” We talked about a dance club as a place where you can go to d ance, or simply a club. “Club music,” then, is the kind of music you typica lly hear at a dance club. It’s usually very loud. It is often what we call “electr onic music.” All of the music is made by machines and computers rather than, say, an  actual piano or a drum.

Anastasia says, “What? You love club music?” Of cou rse she didn’t hear what Joshua said. “That’s great. Let’s go dance.” So, the two of them aren’t communicating because of the loud noise. Joshua the n says, “I think I’ll sit this one out.” “To sit something out” means not to parti cipate in something, at least, not participating right away, maybe wait a little w hile for the next opportunity. So, there’s a song on and you don’t really like it and you don’t want to dance to it. You may say to your boyfriend or girlfriend or dog,  if you bring your dog to the dance club, as I do, “Let’s sit this one out. I don ’t want to dance to this song. We’ll dance to the next one.” And your dog goes, “W oof, woof!” (I’m crazy, I know.)

Joshua says, “Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here?” The “volume” (volume) is how loud something is or how q uiet it is. That’s the volume. Anastasia says, “What? You want the music to be lou der?” She again doesn’t understand Joshua and thinks Joshua wants the music  to be even louder than it is now. She says, “I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up .” “To turn something up” means to increase the level of something, especially when  we’re talking about volume – on a television or on a radio. It could also be tal king about temperature. “I’m going to turn up the heater.” I’m going to make the  heater give us more heat so it’s warmer in here. Joshua, at the end, simply say s, “No!” meaning, no, he doesn’t want the music to be louder.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Anastasia:  This is the best club in the city.  Gra ce brought me here last month. You’re going to love it.

 Joshua:  What?!

Anastasia:  You’re going to love this club.  It has  the best DJ in town. She spins the best mixes.

Joshua:  Did you say you’re going to get us some mi xed drinks?

Anastasia:  No, I said that this DJ is great.  She plays music that gets people pumped up.  Oh, I love this song. It samples from t wo of my favorite songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.

Joshua:  Did you say that you want to buy this CD?

Joshua:  Let’s wait until she segues into something  mellower.  I don’t really like dancing to this kind of club music.

Anastasia:  What?!  You love club music?  That’s gr eat.  Let’s go dance!

Joshua:  I think I’ll sit this one out.  Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here?

Anastasia:  What?!  You want the music to be louder ?  I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up.

Joshua:  No!

[end of dialog]

She doesn’t normally spin mixes in a dance club, I don’t think. But she does write wonderful scripts. I speak of our wonderful scriptw riter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.

# A Publicity Stunt

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 872: A Publicity Stunt

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 872. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialog between Hank and Svetlana about a publicity stunt, about an attempt by a business to get people to pay  attention to it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Hank:  What’s that for?

Svetlana:  This costume?  I’m planning a publicity stunt to get our store more business.

Hank:  You think that dressing up as a giant banana  will get our store more business?

Svetlana:  We need to get media coverage for the gr and opening of our store and attract as much attention as possible.  I’ll be on hand to give sound bites and organize photo ops.

Hank:  How does a giant banana tie into our store?

Svetlana:  It doesn’t directly, but trust me, it’ll  get noticed.

Hank:  I was thinking of a traditional marketing ca mpaign, more along the lines of holding a contest or a giveaway. And I don’t see ho w a giant banana is going to get media attention.

Svetlana:  The person in the giant banana costume w ill skydive into the parking lot of the store.

Hank:  What idiot have you convinced to do that?

Svetlana:  Well, that’s actually why I’m here...

[end of dialog]

Hank begins by asking Svetlana, “What’s that for?” meaning “Why do you have that?” Svetlana says, “This costume?” A “costume” ( costume) refers to clothing that you wear so that you look like a different per son. People wear costumes, for example, on Halloween. They dress up or they put on  clothing to make them look like someone else. Little children may put on costu me to make them look like Superman or someone from Star Wars. I don’t know. I  don’t know what kids wear nowadays for costumes at Halloween.

Svetlana says that she’s planning a publicity stunt  “to get our stores more business.” “Publicity” (publicity) is attention tha t you get, especially from newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television s tations, and so forth. “Publicity” refers to attention you get from what w e would call the “media” (media), which refers to all the different ways peo ple get their information. Nowadays, that would include the Internet. A “stunt ” (stunt) is some action or some event that people do just to get attention. A “publicity stunt” is something a business or a person would do so that everybody els e pays attention to them. Usually, it involves fooling or tricking people int o believing something that isn’t true. That doesn’t always happen but that’s one kin d of publicity stunt.

Svetlana says she’s doing a publicity stunt “to get  our store more business.” “Business” here means more money, more people buyin g from us. Hank says, “You think that dressing up as a giant banana will get our store more business?” “To dress up as” means to wear a costume, to put on  special clothing. The verb “to dress up” usually means to put on nice clothes,  like you’re going to a nice dinner or a wedding, for example. “Dressing up as” means you’re putting on clothes like a costume, to pretend like you are a d ifferent person.

Svetlana says, “We need to get media coverage for t he grand opening of our store and attract as much attention as possible.” “ Media,” we’ve already talked about, refers to television, newspapers, and so for th. “Coverage” (coverage) means when these media sources – the newspapers, the magazines – write stories or have stories about you on their programs . If someone says, “There wasn’t a lot of coverage about the election this we ek,” they mean there weren’t very many stories in the newspapers or in the magaz ines or on television about that topic. “Coverage” refers to the amount that the news media is paying attention and talking about something.

 A “grand opening” is a big celebration, a big event  when a business opens up a new store or simply opens up their first store. Gra nd openings often have some sort of celebration attached to them or connected t o them. Sometimes you’ll have the mayor or the governor come to celebrate this op ening of a new business or of a new location for your business. Usually, the gove rnor doesn’t come to those sorts of things. Well, it’s possible.

Svetlana wants to get media coverage for the grand opening of their store and attract as much attention as possible. “To attract”  means to pull something toward yourself or, more generally, to cause someon e to become interested in you. That’s why we have the adjective “attractive.”  A woman who is attractive attracts men. Men become interested in her and walk  toward her and she, of course, turns around and walks in the other directi on. I guess that just happens to me.

“Attention” (attention) is a measure of how much pe ople are noticing someone or something. How much people are focused on a certain  thing or a certain person. “To attract attention,” then, is to get people to p ay attention, to look at you, to notice what you are doing.

Svetlana says that she’ll be on hand to give “sound  bites and organize photo ops.” The expression “to be on hand” means to be pr esent, to be there, to be available and ready in case someone wants, in this case, to talk to you. It’s an expression we would use mostly in business, talking  about someone who is going to be at a certain event.

A “sound bite” (bite) is a short phrase, sentence, or paragraph with some interesting information that is used, typically, in  a news story. You might have a politician who wants to get attention and he knows that typically, on television, you only have maybe 10 or 15 seconds. He will come up with some phrase, some expression that people will remember that will  summarize all of his ideas and arguments. That’s what a sound bite is. It’s a short quote, really, from someone about some situation in the news.

A “photo op” (op) is short for a “photo opportunity .” It’s a situation or an event that photographers like to come to or people from televi sion stations come to, to take pictures of something. Here in Hollywood, in Los An geles, every week there’s typically a new movie that is opening and they have  a celebration where they invite photographers, television stations to come a nd take pictures of the stars of the movie. This is a photo op – an opportunity for someone to have their photograph taken.

 Hank says, “How does a giant banana tie in to our s tore?” Remember Svetlana is going to dress up as a giant banana. Hank wants to know how this “ties into” their store. “To tie (tie) into something” means to relat e to, to be connected to something. Svetlana says, “It doesn’t.” It does not  tie into our store directly. “But trust me, it’ll get noticed.” People will notice us .

Hank says, “I was thinking of a traditional marketi ng campaign, more along the lines of holding a contest or a giveaway. And I don ’t see how a giant banana is going to get media attention.” A “marketing campaig n” is an effort to get people familiar with your product or your service. It’s a term we use in business to talk about making people aware that you exist. “Along the lines of” is an expression meaning related to or similar to. Hank was thinking  of a traditional marketing campaign, more along the lines of holding a contest  or a giveaway. He wants a marketing campaign that’s similar to something such  as holding, or having a contest or a giveaway. A “contest” is typically a c ompetition where people try to win something based either on luck or on something that they do. A “giveaway” (giveaway) – one word – is a noun referring to some thing that people are given for free, often by an organization that is trying t o market their product or service, to promote, to get people to pay attention to their  product or service.

Hank says, “I don’t see how a giant banana is going  to get media attention.” “Media attention” is the same as publicity. Svetlan a says, “The person in the giant banana costume will skydive into the parking lot of the store.” “To skydive” (skydive) means to jump out of an airplane and then  with, what we would call a “parachute,” to come down to the ground and land on  the ground – without dying, that’s the idea. The giant banana then, is going to  jump out of an airplane. It’s going to skydive into the parking lot of the store.  That’s how Svetlana will get people to pay attention to the giant banana.

Hank says, “What idiot have you convinced to do tha t?” He thinks this is a stupid idea and only a stupid person would agree to do it.  Svetlana says, “Well, that’s actually why I’m here.” What she’s saying is that s he wants Hank to be the person who dresses up in the giant banana and dives  out of the plane – skydives out of the plane.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Hank:  What’s that for?

Svetlana:  This costume?  I’m planning a publicity stunt to get our store more business.

Hank:  You think that dressing up as a giant banana  will get our store more business?

Svetlana:  We need to get media coverage for the gr and opening of our store and attract as much attention as possible.  I’ll be on hand to give sound bites and organize photo ops.

Hank:  How does a giant banana tie into our store?

Svetlana:  It doesn’t directly, but trust me, it’ll  get noticed.

Hank:  I was thinking of a traditional marketing ca mpaign, more along the lines of holding a contest or a giveaway. And I don’t see ho w a giant banana is going to get media attention.

Svetlana:  The person in the giant banana costume w ill skydive into the parking lot of the store.

Hank:  What idiot have you convinced to do that?

Svetlana:  Well, that’s actually why I’m here...

# Avoiding Giving an Opinion

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 873: Avoiding Giving an Opinion

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 873. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode like all of our episodes has a Learnin g Guide. You can get that by going to our website: www.ESLPod.com .

This episode is a dialog between Ariel and Paolo ab out trying not to give your opinion. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ariel:  I know you’ll give me the inside scoop.  Wh at’s going on between Sam and Matt?

Paolo:  You’re asking the wrong person.

Ariel:  Don’t be like that.  You know both of them really well, and I know that Sam confides in you.  Don’t you think Matt is being unr easonable?

Paolo:  I really couldn’t say.

Ariel:  Why are you being so close-mouthed?  I’m su re you have an opinion.

Paolo:  I’ve never given it much thought, to be hon est, and I don’t think it’s any of my business.

Ariel:  But they’re both friends of yours.  You mus t have at least speculated on what’s happening.  It’s only human.  Do you think S am is going to leave Matt?

Paolo:  Your guess is as good as mine.  I really do n’t know anything and don’t have an opinion either way!

Ariel:  That’s just not possible.  Okay, okay, what  do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?

Paolo:  Ugh!

 [end of dialog]

Ariel begins by saying to Paolo, “I’ll know you’ll give me the inside scoop.” The expression “inside scoop” (scoop) means secret info rmation that not everyone else knows. “Scoop” can sometimes be used in the wo rld of journalism, in newspapers, for example, to describe a story that o ne newspaper gets before any of the other newspapers get it. That would be a  scoop. An “inside scoop” is some secret about some situation that no one else k nows about, but that someone tells you. Ariel wants Paolo to give her the inside scoop.

She says, “What’s going on between Sam and Matt?” “ What’s going on” means what’s the problem, what’s the story, what is happe ning. Paolo says, “You’re asking the wrong person.” When someone says, “You’r e asking the wrong person,” they’re telling you that you don’t have an y information about that situation. You are not the person to ask or simply,  you don’t know.

Ariel says, “Don’t be like that.” That phrase “Don’ t be like that” is used to change someone’s behavior or attitude or to stop someone f rom doing something, usually something you don’t like. You want the pers on to be more helpful to you. In this case, Paolo does not want to answer Ariel’s  question and Ariel is asking him to change his attitude, to change his behavior – “Don’t be like that.”

“You know both of them really well,” she says, “and  I know that Sam confides in you.” “To confide (confide) in someone” is to trust  someone, to tell that person your secrets, your personal thoughts. Ariel says th at Sam confides in Paolo. “Don’t you think Matt is being unreasonable?” she a sks. “To be unreasonable” is to be not reasonable. “Reasonable” is rational, log ical; not reasonable, “unreasonable,” is illogical or irrational.

Paolo says, “I really couldn’t say.” This expressio n “I really couldn’t say” again means I don’t know or I’m not sure. We use it when we don’t really want to answer someone’s question. Someone asks us a questi on and we don’t really want to give them the answer, but we don’t want to lie to them. We might say, “I really couldn’t say.” That doesn’t exactly mean you  don’t know. It may really mean that you don’t want to say but you’re implying  that you’re not really sure.

Ariel says, “Why are you being so close-mouthed?” “ Close-mouthed” (mouthed) means you do not want to give someone information. You don’t want to talk about a certain topic. Paolo is being close-mouthed  with Ariel. She says, “I’m sure you have an opinion,” meaning I’m sure you hav e an idea, something that you think about the situation.

 Paolo responds, “I’ve never given it much thought, to be honest.” When you say you’ve never given something much thought, you’re s aying that you haven’t spent a lot of time thinking about it. It hasn’t be en something that has been worrying you, and therefore you don’t really have a n opinion about it. “I haven’t given it much thought” can mean “I haven’t thought about it enough to make a decision.” Or it could mean “I don’t really know, I  don’t care that much, and therefore I don’t have a strong opinion about the s ituation.”

Paolo says, “I don’t think it’s any of my business. ” This is a very important phrase – “to be of your business,” as in when someone says , “It’s not any of your business,” or “It’s not any of my business,” means it’s not something that you should  be concerned about. It’s not something that affect s you personally, and therefore it’s not something you should be talking about or asking about. The related expression here is, “It’s none of your busi ness.” That’s a very strong thing to say to someone who’s asking you about something that you don’t think they have any right to know. It’s not something that con cerns them. It’s a rather strong statement, however, when you say, “It’s none of you r business.” That is really saying, “You are doing something you should not.” I t’s definitely a criticism of someone. When you say, “It isn’t any of my business ,” however, you’re just saying, “Well, that’s not my concern and therefore I don’t know anything about it and I don’t think I should know anything about it.”

Ariel says, “But they’re both friends of yours. You  must have speculated on what’s happening.” “To speculate (speculate) on som ething” means to think about something and to have an opinion about it eve n though you don’t have any evidence, even though you don’t have any strong wha t we would call “proof” (proof) – something that tells you for sure whether  this is true or that is true. “To speculate on something is to think about it without  having all of the information you really need in order to have an opinion. It’s a  guess about what is happening. Often, that is of course, a very bad idea.

Ariel says, “It’s only human.” “It’s only human” he re is used to talk about negative things that everyone does, even if they don’t want to or aren’t supposed to. It’s only human that you get angry when the waiter is no t nice to you. We’re not saying that it’s a good thing to get angry at the w aiter. It isn’t, but it’s only human. We can understand because that’s what happens to us  weak human beings.

Ariel says, “Do you think Sam is going to leave Mat t?” (Sam can also be short for Samantha, a woman’s name.) Ariel wants to know if S am is going to leave Matt. “To leave someone” here means to end a romantic rel ationship with that person. “To break up with someone” is another way of saying  that.

 Paolo says, “Your guess is as good as mine.” The ex pression “Your guess is as good as mine” means that you don’t have any more in formation about it than the person you’re talking to. “I don’t know. Your guess  is as good as mine.” You don’t know. I don’t know. We’re both guessing. Either of us could be right.

He then says, “I really don’t know anything and don ’t have an opinion either way. “Either way” here means either for or against somet hing. There could be two possibilities but you’re not sure which is correct.  We might say, for example, of a game, “It could go either way.” Team A could win or  Team B could win. You’re not really sure. In this case, Paolo doesn’t have a n opinion either way, meaning he doesn’t know whether the two people are going to  stay together or break up.

Ariel says, “That’s just not possible. Okay. Okay. What do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?” Immediately Ariel ask s Paolo’s opinion about another couple, another two people, and wants to kn ow what Paolo thinks of them. Paolo just says, “Ugh,” which is a sound that  you would make when you are frustrated or upset or tired of this person ask ing you this question or talking to you about this situation. And that definitely is wh at is happening to Paolo.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Ariel:  I know you’ll give me the inside scoop.  Wh at’s going on between Sam and Matt?

Paolo:  You’re asking the wrong person.

Ariel:  Don’t be like that.  You know both of them really well, and I know that Sam confides in you.  Don’t you think Matt is being unr easonable?

Paolo:  I really couldn’t say.

Ariel:  Why are you being so close-mouthed?  I’m su re you have an opinion.

Ariel:  That’s just not possible.  Okay, okay, what  do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?

Paolo:  Ugh!

# Poor Road Conditions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 874: Poor Road Conditions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 874. I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan coming to you from the Center for Ed ucational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there to download a L earning Guide for this episode that will give you a complete transcript of  everything we say.

This episode is a dialogue between Alice and Sam ab out going out onto the street, onto the roads in a city or a town, and hav ing problems with the road conditions. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Alice:  I’m really glad I let you talk me into goin g for a bike ride.  It’s been years since I’ve been on a bicycle.

Sam:  This is the only way to travel.  You get to r eally see the scenery and enjoy the fresh air.

Alice:  Hey, watch out!  You almost dropped into th at huge pothole.  This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.

Sam:  Thanks for the warning.  Yeah, this asphalt r eally needs to be repaired.  I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it’s full of r uts.  Oh, slow down!  There’s a big dip ahead.

Alice:  Whoa!  I didn’t see that coming.  I almost lost control on that slippery section of road.  Sorry, I nearly swerved into you.   Are you okay?

Sam:  Yeah, I’m fine.  When I suggested this route,  I was sure it would be an easy ride since it’s paved all the way.  I didn’t b argain for these lousy road conditions.

Alice:  We’ll just have to keep our eyes open and b e thankful for these crash helmets!

Sam:  You won’t blame me if you go flying, will you ?

 Alice:  Not if you break my fall.

[end of dialog]

Alice begins by saying to Sam, “I'm really glad” – I'm really happy –  “I let you talk me into going for a bike ride.” “To talk someone in to something” means to convince them, to persuade them, to get them to agr ee with your opinion of something. Alice and Sam are on a bike ride. “Bike”  (bike) is short for bicycle. Alice says “It's been years since I've been on a bi cycle.” “It's been years since I have been on a bicycle.” A “bicycle,” of course, ha s two wheels and a seat and what we call a “handlebar” that helps you steer or move the bicycle in the correct direction.

Sam says “This is the only way to travel.” This is not to be taken literally. Sam doesn't mean this is the only possible way in the w orld to travel. That expression, “This is the only way,” is used to indicate this is  the best way. This is the way that is better than any other way or method of traveling .

Sam says “You get to really see the scenery and enj oy the fresh air.” “Scenery” (scenery) is what you can see, usually outside of a  building, often referring to trees, lakes, things that are nice to look at, thin gs that are beautiful.

Alice says “Hey! Watch out! You almost dropped into  that huge pothole.” A “pothole” (pothole) is a hole in a street or a road , or a freeway, usually created by a lot of traffic, often caused by the change in tem perature that sometimes makes the surface of the street loose and then you get a hole in the street. We call those holes in the street “potholes.” Alice says Sam almo st went into one of the big potholes in the street.

She says, “This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.” “Asphalt” (asphalt) is a very common surface that we used to cover our streets and our roads, usually made by mixing small rocks with a very hot,  oily substance. It's usually black or a very deep kind of blue when you look at it. That's “asphalt.” Asphalt is used on most of the streets here in Los Angeles. It 's a cheap and effective way to cover the roads to make them smooth, but it's not p erfect. Asphalt can sometimes crack. When we talk about “cracked asphal t,” we mean there are little lines in the asphalt going through the surface wher e the asphalt appears to be separating. A “crack” is anytime you have some surf ace that appears to be separating, causing a line to go through it – what looks like a line. For example, if you have a glass and you hit the glass against the wall, the glass might break, or it might just crack. It might start to fall apart e ven though it’s still in one piece.

 The asphalt is cracked, according to Alice, and the  road is all bumpy. “Bumpy” (bumpy) means that it is uneven. Some areas are hig her than others. So as you drive down it, it's like you're going up and down. Your car moves up and down because the road isn't even. It isn't flat. Sam say s “Thanks for the warning. Yeah, this asphalt really needs to be repaired” – it need s to be fixed. “I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it's full of ruts.” A “gra vel (gravel) path” is an area for bikes, or for people who are walking, that is not c overed with asphalt. Instead, it's covered with small, little rocks. Sam says he can't  go on the gravel path because it's full of ruts. A “rut” (rut) is basically the h ole in the ground that is made by wheels, many different wheels, going over the same spot. If you have a lot of bicycles or a lot of other wheels going over soft g round, and going over it in the same place over and over again, eventually you will  create a rut, which is a long line, a hole, really, in the ground that is caused by these wheels going over and over it.

Sam says, “Slow down. There's a big dip ahead.” A “ dip” (dip) is sort of like a hole. It's an area that's lower than the surroundin g area around it. Alice says, “Whoa! I didn't see that coming.” I didn't anticipa te that. “I almost lost control on that slippery section of the road.”

“To lose control” means you no longer have power to  change the direction that you are moving, or to change what is happening. Som e people may drink too much alcohol and lose control of themselves. They d on't have a way of controlling themselves because they drank too many beers – so don't drink too many beers, especially if you're bicycling! Alice p robably wasn't drinking…we don't know. It's possible Alice was  drinking before we started this dialog, but she doesn't appear to be drinking. The problem appears to be the road itself.

She says she lost control on that slippery section of road. Something that is “slippery” (slippery) is often covered with water o r ice, and is difficult to drive on because things keeps sliding off of it, or sliding around on it. Something that is slippery is something that could be very dangerous because as you walk over it or drive over it, you could suddenly move and then have a problem, possibly even an accident. If you walk on a street that is s lippery, you could fall, for example.

Alice is on a slippery section of the road. She say s, “Sorry. I nearly swerved into you.” “To swerve” (swerve) means to suddenly change  direction in an unexpected way, often to avoid hitting something el se. So, you have two cars traveling down the street and one of the cars sees a little cat that comes out onto the road. Well, some cars would continue driving, b ut most cars would swerve to

miss the cat. They would move the car over to the l eft or to the right suddenly in order not to hit the cat.

Sam says, “I'm fine.” Alice didn't hit him. He says , “When I suggested this route” – this path, this way of getting from one place to another – “I was sure it would be an easy ride since it's paved all the way.” “To be paved” (paved) means to put asphalt, cement, or something else on top of the gr ound, on top of the dirt, in order to make it easier to ride on. Sam says, “I di dn't bargain for these lousy road conditions.” The expression “to bargain for” means here to plan for, to expect something to be in a certain way. Sam says he did n ot plan for, or bargain for these lousy, or bad road conditions. The “condition  of something” is the situation that it is in. It is the state that it is in.

In this case, Sam is referring to bad road conditio ns – roads and streets that are not very easy to drive on. Alice says, “We’ll just have to keep our eyes open” – we’ll have to be alert – “and be thankful for these  crash helmets.” A “helmet” (helmet) is a protective hat that goes over your he ad on the top and on the sides to protect it. A “crash helmet” is something that s omeone riding a bicycle or a motorcycle might have on their head to protect it i n case they fell off of the bicycle or the motorcycle and hit the ground. The c rash helmet would protect their head.

Sam then says to Alice, “You won't blame me if you go flying, will you?” “To go flying,” in this case, would mean to hit something while you're riding the bike and to be thrown from the bike. You would fly in the ai r off the bike and onto the ground. Sam says “You won't blame me” – you won't t hink I'm guilty if that happens to you – will you, Alice? Alice says, “Not if you break my fall.” “To break (break) someone's fall” means to prevent them from getting hurt, by either catching them or by doing something that would prev ent them from hurting themselves by falling on the ground or some hard ob ject. That's Alice's little joke, of course. If Sam broke her fall, he would get hurt  as well, especially if Alice is a big woman…which I don't know if she is or not.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Alice:  I’m really glad I let you talk me into goin g for a bike ride.  It’s been years since I’ve been on a bicycle.

Sam:  This is the only way to travel.  You get to r eally see the scenery and enjoy the fresh air.

Sam:  Thanks for the warning.  Yeah, this asphalt r eally needs to be repaired.  I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it’s full of r uts.  Oh, slow down!  There’s a big dip ahead.

Alice:  Whoa!  I didn’t see that coming.  I almost lost control on that slippery section of road.  Sorry, I nearly swerved into you.   Are you okay?

Sam:  Yeah, I’m fine.  When I suggested this route,  I was sure it would be an easy ride since it’s paved all the way.  I didn’t b argain for these lousy road conditions.

Alice:  We’ll just have to keep our eyes open and b e thankful for these crash helmets!

Sam:  You won’t blame me if you go flying, will you ?

# Shopping at the Supermarket

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 875: Shopping at the Supermarket.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 875. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. On there, you can find o ur ESL Podcast store with additional courses in business and daily English.

This episode is a dialogue between someone who work s at a grocery store, a store where you buy food, and a customer. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialog]

Stocker:  Can I help you find something?

Meg:  Yes, I’m looking for coffee.

Stocker:  That’s on aisle 3.  Let me show you where  it is.

Meg:  Thanks.  Hmm, I don’t see the Jitters brand t hat I normally buy.

Stocker:  It looks like we’re out of stock.  We sho uld get another shipment next week.

Meg:  Okay, I’ll check back.  I’m also looking for the Fructose brand soda, but I didn’t see it in the soda aisle.

Stocker:  I’m afraid that’s been discontinued.  The ir parent company no longer makes soda.

Meg:  Really?  I love Fructose soda.  How about the  Mushy brand bread?  I didn’t see it when I checked the bread aisle.

Stocker:  We no longer stock the Mushy brand.  Ther e were so quality control issues at the company, so we’ve pulled all of their  products from the shelves. Can I help you find anything else?

Meg:  No, I guess I’ll just have to try some new br ands.  Oh, yes, do you carry Worm organic apples?

Stocker:  We normally do, but they’re out of season  right now.  We won’t have any until early summer.

Meg:  All of this shopping and I have nothing to sh ow for it.  I guess I’m going home empty-handed.

Stocker:  We do have chocolate cakes and cookies on  sale.

Meg:  I’m there!

[end of dialog]

The person who begins our dialogue is an employee o f the grocery store, of the supermarket. He's what we would call a “stocker” (s tocker). A “stocker” is a person who puts the products, who puts the food ite ms, on the shelves. He or she is the person who takes them out of a box and p uts them up in a place where you can see them, take them, and then buy them.

The stocker says to one of the customers, named Meg , “Can I help you find something?” Meg says, “Yes I'm looking for coffee.”  The stocker says, “That’s on aisle 3. Let me show you where it is.” “Aisle” (ais le) refers to a passage, a place where you can walk in between two other things. In this case, in a grocery store, in a supermarket, you have long shelves and the she lves are arranged so that you can walk in between them in order to find what you need and take it off the shelf. That space where you walk, that area where y ou walk, is called an “aisle.” Many supermarkets number the aisles so that if you are looking for something – as Meg was looking for coffee – the person can just  tell you where to go. “It's on aisle 3.” “It's on aisle 4.” Then you know exactly where you need to go.

Meg says, “Thanks. I don't see the Jitters brand I normally buy.” Meg is looking for a particular kind of coffee, a specific “brand”  (brand). “Brand” is the name that the company gives their product. You could have Die t Coke. That would be a brand. Or, we have something here in the US called “Coke Zero.” That's the brand, or “Coca-Cola” itself could be considered a brand. Meg is looking for a particular kind of coffee and she doesn't see it th ere. The stocker says, “It looks like we’re out of stock.” “To be out of stock” mean s not to have available for sale something that you normally sell. Normally, they se ll this kind of coffee, but everyone came in and bought it, and now they don't have any more. They're out of stock. “Stock,” I should say, refers to the thin gs that the store sells. The

opposite of out of stock is “in stock.” “Do you hav e this in stock?” That means “Do you have that item available for sale?”

The coffee Meg wants is out of stock. The stocker t ells her though that they should get another shipment next week. A “shipment”  (shipment) is when you get a large group of something delivered to your house or more typically, to your business – in this case, to the supermarket. Maybe every day they'll get a new shipment of vegetables, boxes of vegetables that wi ll come in and they will sell. That's a shipment.

Meg says, “Okay, I'll check back.” “To check back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to come back at a later time to see if you have it. “I'll check back next week” means I will come back next week and see if y ou have it. Meg says, “I'm also looking for the Fructose brand soda but I don' t see it in the soda aisle.” The stocker says, “I'm afraid” – I'm sorry to tell you – “that's been discontinued.” “To discontinue” something is to no longer make it avai lable, perhaps because it isn't very popular. Or maybe it was just too expensive for the store to buy and sell – “to discontinue,” to stop making something availabl e.

The stocker says the “parent company” of the brand that Meg wants “no longer makes soda.” A “parent company” is a large company that owns usually smaller divisions or smaller sections of their company that  make different kinds of products. The parent company is the company that is  in charge of all the other small companies, or in this case, divisions of that  company. Meg says, “Really? I love Fructose soda.” She's disappointed. Then she a sks, “How about the Mushy Bran bread?” “How about” means “Do you have,” in th is case, “the Mushy brand bread.” These are not, I should say, real brands th at you will find in an American supermarket.

Meg says, “I didn't see the Mushy brand bread when I checked the bread aisle.” The stocker says, “We no longer stock the Mushy bra nd.” Here, notice “stock” is used as a verb, meaning to make available, to carry , to keep something available to sell. The stocker is saying the supermarket no l onger stocks this brand. It is no longer available. The company is still making that bread but this sup ermarket no longer stocks it. He says, “There were some quality control issues at  the company so we pulled all of our products from the shelves.”

“Quality control” refers to the process, the steps that a company has to make sure that what they make is good quality, is what i t is supposed to be. The stocker says this company had some quality control issues. He really means “problems.” So, the supermarket pulled their produc ts. “To pull” here means to

stop selling something to your customers, to no lon ger make it available for sale. That's what the stocker means here when he says tha t “We've pulled all their products.” He says, “We’ve pulled all their product s from the shelves.”

“Shelves” is the plural of “shelf” (shelf). A “shel f,” as I mentioned earlier, is a place where the food is put so that you can see it,  and take it, and buy it. That's a shelf. It's a place where you place things, you put  things either for someone to buy or simply to keep them there. Shelves usually h ave three or four different sections in a grocery store and each section has a space in between it so that you can put the products there.

The stocker says, “Can I help you find anything els e?” Meg says, “No. I guess I'll just have to try some new brands. Oh yes, do you ca rry Worm organic apples?” “To carry” here means to sell in your store, to hav e in stock or to normally have in stock. Something that you normally sell is somethin g that you carry. Meg is asking if the supermarket carries a certain kind of  organic apple. “Organic” (organic) refers to food that is grown without any artificial or extra chemicals. Organic food is very popular now in certain parts o f the United States and other countries, of course.

The stockers says, “We normally do” – we normally d o have these kinds of apples in stock – “but they're out of season right now.” “To be out of season” means that this particular food is not being grown or is not available in a certain area. If you only want to buy food that is grown fr om your local area, from your area where you live, there'll be parts of the year when certain kinds of food is not available because it's not being grown in that area  at that time.

In Minnesota, for example, where it’s very cold, yo u can't get any fresh vegetables during the wintertime because they're no t able to grow the food at that time. Of course, you can get vegetables. You c an get them from other parts of the country or other parts of the world and that 's exactly what we do, but if you only want to buy them from a certain area, it's lik ely that that area, at some point during the year, will not have that food available and therefore it will be “out of season.”

The stocker says, “We won't have any of these apple s until early summer.” Meg says, “All of this shopping and I have nothing to s how for it.” The expression “to have nothing to show for it” means “I've done a lot  of work but I don't have any results. I don't have what I wanted to have.” Meg s ays, “I guess I'm going home empty-handed.” “To be empty (empty) - handed (hande d)” means you don't have anything. Literally, you don't have anything in you r hands. Your hands are empty.

“To go home empty-handed” means to go home without have purchased or bought anything.

The stocker says, “We do have chocolate cakes and c ookies on sale.” The stocker is telling Meg that even though they don't have these other kinds of food, they still have cakes and cookies. Meg gets excited  and says, “I'm there.” “I'm there” is a phrase that we use informally to show t hat you plan on doing something and that you are very excited about it. S omeone may say, “Oh, the new Star Wars movie is coming out next year.” And y ou say, “Oh, I’m there,” meaning I am definitely going to be there.

I probably will not be there, but that's how we wou ld use that particular expression.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Stocker:  Can I help you find something?

Meg:  Yes, I’m looking for coffee.

Stocker:  That’s on aisle 3.  Let me show you where  it is.

Meg:  Thanks.  Hmm, I don’t see the Jitters brand t hat I normally buy.

Stocker:  It looks like we’re out of stock.  We sho uld get another shipment next week.

Meg:  Okay, I’ll check back.  I’m also looking for the Fructose brand soda, but I didn’t see it in the soda aisle.

Stocker:  I’m afraid that’s been discontinued.  The ir parent company no longer makes soda.

Meg:  Really?  I love Fructose soda.  How about the  Mushy brand bread?  I didn’t see it when I checked the bread aisle.

Stocker:  We no longer stock the Mushy brand.  Ther e were so quality control issues at the company, so we’ve pulled all of their  products from the shelves. Can I help you find anything else?

 Meg:  No, I guess I’ll just have to try some new br ands.  Oh, yes, do you carry Worm organic apples?

Stocker:  We normally do, but they’re out of season  right now.  We won’t have any until early summer.

Meg:  All of this shopping and I have nothing to sh ow for it.  I guess I’m going home empty-handed.

Stocker:  We do have chocolate cakes and cookies on  sale.

Meg:  I’m there!

This episode is a dialog between Melinda and Chad a bout preparing a portfolio of your work. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Melinda:  Ta da!  I’m finally done with my portfoli o.  Do you want to see it?

Chad:  Sure.  This portfolio has samples of your wo rk, right?

Melinda:  It does, but it’s much more than that.  I t’s a presentation of the highlights of my career, with examples of my ground breaking work.

Chad:  Uh, okay, if you say so.

Melinda:  Let me show you.  The first page is a fac t sheet of my major accomplishments, clients, jobs, and awards.  That’s  followed by a more detailed resume.  And then, there are some samples of my bes t work, and finally, there are testimonials from satisfied clients.

Chad:  But this is still a work in progress, right?

Melinda:  What do you mean?

Chad:  Well, your fact sheet is a half a page long.   There are two samples of your work, and there are no testimonials, just a blank p age.

Melinda:  I admit that it’s a little thin right now , but what do you expect?  I just started working in the field six months ago.  This portfolio shows that there is room for growth.

Chad:  Yeah, plenty of room.

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Melinda saying to Chad, “T a da!” That's an expression, “Ta (ta) da (da),” that we use when we are proud of  something that were presenting to someone else – like, “Here's somethin g that I painted,” or “Here is my song,” and you show it to the other person becau se you are proud of it, because you think you did a good job. You say, “Ta da!” – means “Here it is. Look at this!”

Melinda says “I'm finally done with my portfolio.” A “portfolio” is a collection of your work, usually the best things that you have do ne. If you're an artist, for example, it would be a collection of your pictures;  if you're photographer, of your photographs; if you're a writer, perhaps, of some o f the things that you've written – any collection of your work that you use either t o give to someone who may give you a job – a potential employer – or to give to someone who might want to hire you. So, if you're an architect, you might hav e a portfolio of the plans that you've drawn of buildings to show to someone who mi ght want to hire you to work for them.

Melinda has a portfolio. She asked Chad if he wants  to see it. Chad says, “Sure. This portfolio has samples of your work, right?” “S amples” (sample) is one piece of something that is used to represent a larger gro up. A sample, in this case, would be one of the things that Melinda has done. A n “example,” is another way of saying this.

Melinda says, “It does.” My portfolio does have sam ples of my work. “But it's much more than that. It's a presentation of the hig hlights of my career, with examples of my groundbreaking work.” The “highlight  (highlight)” of something is the most important or most interesting part of some thing, the best thing among a group of things. “The highlight of the evening was when I told a joke and everyone laughed.” That probably wouldn't be the hi ghlight of the evening, but that would be an example of what I think is the mos t important thing that happened during that event. The portfolio has “high lights,” or some of the best things that Melinda has done in her career, in her work experience. “With examples of,” she says, her “groundbreaking work.” “Groundbreaking” is something that is new, something that is interestin g, something that no one else has done before.

Chad says, “Uh, okay, if you say so.” What Chad is saying here really is that he thinks Melinda might be bragging a little bit. Meli nda might be saying how

important she is and of course, no one likes to lis ten to someone else tell them how important they are. So Chad doesn't really like  the way that Melinda is describing herself.

Melinda says, however, “Let me show you.” Let me de monstrate to you by letting you look at something. The first page of her portfo lio is a “fact sheet of my major accomplishments, clients, jobs and awards.” A “fact  (fact) sheet (sheet) is just what it sounds like – a sheet of paper, a piece of paper, that lists certain important facts about you or about a company or abo ut whatever is the subject of that particular report. In this case, it's a list o f the Melinda's “accomplishments, clients, jobs and awards.”

“Accomplishments” are things that you have done – a chievements – usually things that are important. It might be, for example , publishing a book. That might be an accomplishment, something that you have done that you're proud of, that's important. “Clients” (clients) are the people who h ave bought things from you, either your products or your services. A client is the same thing as a customer, someone who buys something from you. It's used more  in professional occupations like lawyers, for example, have clients , whereas, if you work at a store, you would just talk about your customers.

Melinda’s fact sheet has a list of her clients, job s, and awards. An “award” is a prize or an honor given to someone to recognize som e good thing that they have done. Maybe they were the best salesman of that mon th, or maybe someone was the fastest runner in their high school. They m ight get an award for that. Usually, an award is either a metal or, perhaps, wh at we would call a “trophy” (trophy). A “trophy” is sort of like a small statue  really that people give as an award. An award might also just be a piece of paper  that says you have won this award.

Melinda says that the fact sheet that she has is fo llowed by a more detailed resume. When we say it's “followed by,” we mean tha t after the fact sheet, perhaps underneath it in the portfolio, as you open  up the folder where she might have this information, you’d find a resume. A “resu me” (resume) is a written document showing your work and education. It's used  if you are applying for a job. It's a summary of the places you've worked, the schools you've attended, the things that you've done.

Melinda then says, “And then there are some samples  of my best work, and finally there are testimonials from satisfied clien ts.” A “testimonial” (testimonial) is a written statement or perhaps an audio or video re cording from a customer who is happy with whatever they purchased. A “testimoni al” usually is a letter or an

email that someone sends a company that says, “Wow,  I really loved what you sold me. I really love this thing that I purchased from you, I bought.” “Satisfied clients” would be clients who are happy, who are pl eased with something, who are pleased with or happy with whatever they bought  from you.

Chad says, “But this is still a work in progress ri ght?” A “work in progress” (progress) is something that isn't completed yet. I t isn't finished. You haven't done everything you need to do. Melinda says, “What  do you mean?” Chad says, “Well, your fact sheet is a half a page long.” In o ther words, it's not very long. It's just one half of a piece of paper. He says, “There are two samples of your work” – which isn’t very much – “and there are no testimo nials, just a blank page.” “Blank” (blank) here means empty, without any words , without any photos, nothing on it. So, she doesn't have any testimonial s and she only has two samples of her work.

Melinda says, “I admit that it's a little thin righ t now.” When she says “it's a little thin,” she means there isn't much in there. There i sn't a lot of content. There is not a lot of substance. “But,” she says, “what do y ou expect?” That question, “What do you expect?” means you should not be surpr ised. “I just started working in the field” – in this kind of job – “six months a go. This portfolio shows that there is room for growth.” The expression “room for growt h” (growth) means that you have opportunities for improvement, that it's not f inished, it's not complete. You still have a lot more that you can accomplish. Chad  says, “Yeah, plenty of room.” “Plenty (plenty) of something” is a lot of somethin g – much. “We have plenty of food.” We have a lot of food. Melinda has “plenty o f room for growth,” meaning she hasn’t really accomplished very much so far. So , of course, she can only do better in terms of the things she puts in her portf olio.

Let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal sp eed.

[start of dialog]

Melinda:  Ta da!  I’m finally done with my portfoli o.  Do you want to see it?

Chad:  Sure.  This portfolio has samples of your wo rk, right?

Melinda:  It does, but it’s much more than that.  I t’s a presentation of the highlights of my career, with examples of my ground breaking work.

Chad:  Uh, okay, if you say so.

Melinda:  Let me show you.  The first page is a fac t sheet of my major accomplishments, clients, jobs, and awards.  That’s  followed by a more detailed resume.  And then, there are some samples of my bes t work, and finally, there are testimonials from satisfied clients.

Chad:  Yeah, plenty of room.

# Cheering Someone Up

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 877: Cheering Someone Up.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 877. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. (That didn't sou nd very beautiful. I'm sorry.)

Our website is beautiful. It's at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialog between Eleanor and Porter , about trying to make someone happy who is sad, trying to cheer them up. Let's get started

[start of dialog]

Eleanor:  Isn’t it a beautiful day?  The sun is shi ning; the birds are singing.  It’s good to be alive!

Porter:  Okay, Pollyanna, go spread good cheer some where else.

Eleanor:  What’s wrong with you?  You must have wok en up on the wrong side of the bed.

Porter:  I’m just having a bad day – no, make that a bad month.  Nothing is going my way.

Eleanor:  Cheer up!  Every cloud has a silver linin g and it’s no use crying over spilled milk.

Porter:  Spare me your platitudes, and let me wallo w in my own misery.

Eleanor:  I can’t do that.  If your work isn’t goin g well, then practice makes perfect.  You’ll just do better next time.

Porter:  It’s not my work.

Eleanor:  Is it your girlfriend?  If your girlfrien d isn’t being nice to you then there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Don’t you see?  Wha tever the problem is, it’s not the end of the world.

Porter:  My biggest problem right now is easy to fi x.

 Eleanor:  How?

[Door slams.]

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Eleanor saying to Porter, “I sn't it a beautiful day? The sun is shining” – the sun is out – “the birds are singi ng. It's good to be alive!” Eleanor is very happy, but Porter is not. Porter said, “Oka y Pollyanna, go spread cheer somewhere else.” “Pollyanna” (Pollyanna) is the nam e of a character from a novel back in 1913, called Pollyanna. Pollyanna was  always happy, always cheerful, always optimistic. Now it's used to descr ibe someone who's like that. She's a Pollyanna. It sometimes used as almost an i nsult, however, to someone who's too happy, who’s too cheery, who's too optimi stic.

“Cheer” (cheer) a noun and a verb. As a verb, it me ans to make someone happy who is sad. As a noun, it means happiness. “To spre ad good cheer” means to make other people happy by smiling, by talking to t hem and so forth. That's spreading good cheer – spreading happiness, giving other people happiness.

Eleanor says, “What's wrong with you? You must have  woken up on the wrong side of the bed.” “To wake up on the wrong side of the bed” means to be in a very bad mood. I'm not sure exactly why we have thi s expression. Maybe if you wake up and you get out of bed on the wrong side, y ou'll hit a wall or you’ll fall over or I don't know. But that's the expression – “ to wake up on the wrong side of the bed.” The “bed,” of course, is something that y ou sleep in at night.

Porter says, “I'm just having a bad day – no,  make  that a bad month.” The expression “make that” is used when we want to corr ect something we just said, especially if we are talking about numbers.

Porter says that nothing is going his way. “To go y our way” means to go as you have planned it to go, as you want it to go, to be successful at something that you are attempting to do. That's “to go your way.” Don't confuse this with another expression, “to go your own (own) way.” “To go your  own way” means to do something different from everyone else, to do somet hing that is not like anyone else. I think there was actually a song back in the  70’s by Fleetwood Mac.

“You can go your own way. Go your own way.”

I think a woman sang it, though. Anyway…too much co ffee today, Jeff!

 Porter says that nothing is going his way. Eleanor says “Cheer up” – be happy. “To cheer up” is a phrasal verb. Like a lot of phra sal verbs, it is used to add emphasis. Instead of just saying “cheer,” we would say “cheer up.” You’re telling someone to be happy, to get happier. Eleanor says, “Every cloud has a silver lining.” This is an old expression, an old saying, “Every cloud has a silver lining.” A “cloud” is what's up in the sky. That's where rai n comes from. The expression “a silver lining” means something that is good. For  a cloud to have a silver lining means that even if it's a bad thing that is happeni ng, like a cloud where it might rain, there's something good that may come out of i t. It's not completely negative. There's always some positive things that you can fi nd when something bad happens. “Every cloud has a silver lining.”

Eleanor is telling Porter that he needs to cheer up  because even though he's having a bad month, something good will come from t his bad month. She then uses another old expression, “It's no use crying ov er spilled milk.” “It's no use” means it's no good, it doesn't help you, “crying ov er spilled milk.” “To cry over something” is to cry because of something. “Milk” i s what you get from, say, a cow, that you drink. I have milk every morning with  my cereal. “Spilled” means that the milk was in a glass, for example, and you hit the glass and the milk fell on the ground. That would be “spilled milk.” You sp illed it. The expression, putting all these things together, “It's no use cry ing over spilled milk,” means it doesn't help worrying about something that already happened. You can't go back and change it. You can't go back and do something d ifferent. That's not possible. You can't change history. So, you just have to worr y about the future.

Porter says, “Spare me your platitudes and let me w allow in my own misery.” “Spare (spare) me” means stop doing something, or m ore typically, stop giving me this information. Stop talking to me about what you are talking about. I don't want to hear it anymore. It's uninteresting, or it' s boring, or I disagree with it. Spare me your lecture. Spare me your advice. I don' t want to hear it.

Porter says, “Spare me your platitudes.” A “platitu de” (platitude) is an expression or a statement that is very common, that everyone s ays, and it's no longer very interesting. It's like saying, “Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” Today is the day that you will continue living. Well, yes th at's true, but it's really not very interesting. That would be a platitude. Another wor d for platitude is a “cliché (cliché). A “cliché” is an expression that everyone  uses so that it doesn't really mean anything anymore.

Porter says to Eleanor, “Let me wallow in my own mi sery.” “To wallow” (wallow) means to enjoy being sad, usually because you're tr ying to get sympathy or

attention from other people. “He wallowed in his sa dness.” He sat there looking sad but in a way hoping other people would notice h e was looking sad so they would pay attention to him. Porter says, “Let me wa llow in my own misery.” “Misery (misery) is suffering, sadness, often becau se you are sick or you don't have enough money.

Eleanor says, “I can't do that. If your work isn't going well, then practice makes perfect.” That's another old expression. “Practice makes perfect” means that if you do something enough times, you will get better at it. You will get perfect at it. Eleanor says, “You'll just do better next time.” Po rter then says, “It's not my work.” He’s not sad because of his work. Eleanor sa ys, “Is it your girlfriend? If your girlfriend isn't being nice to you, then there  are plenty of fish in the sea.” The expression, “There are plenty of fish in the sea (s ea)” is used to tell men and women who are single, who perhaps don't have a boyf riend or a girlfriend, or who have one that isn't very good, that there are other  men and women out there, that you don't have to just stay with this person, that there are many different fish in the sea. There are many different men and women tha t you can go out and find and date.

Eleanor says, “Don't you see? Whatever the problem is, it's not the end of the world.” “The end of the world” is a phrase used to mean the worst possible thing that can happen. But Eleanor says, “It's not the en d of the world.” It's a bad thing, but it's not the worst possible thing that can happ en. Porter says, “My biggest problem right now is easy to fix.” “Easy to fix” me ans easy to solve. Eleanor says, “How?” And then we hear the door slam. This is Port er walking away from Eleanor and slamming the door. When you “slam (slam ) the door,” you close it very loudly so that it makes a loud noise. Usually,  we do this when were angry at someone, or when we’re trying to get away from some one, and Porter, I guess, is trying to get away from Eleanor

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialog]

Eleanor:  Isn’t it a beautiful day?  The sun is shi ning; the birds are singing.  It’s good to be alive!

Porter:  Okay, Pollyanna, go spread good cheer some where else.

Eleanor:  What’s wrong with you?  You must have wok en up on the wrong side of the bed.

Porter:  I’m just having a bad day – no, make that a bad month.  Nothing is going my way.

Eleanor:  Cheer up!  Every cloud has a silver linin g and it’s no use crying over spilled milk.

Porter:  Spare me your platitudes, and let me wallo w in my own misery.

Eleanor:  I can’t do that.  If your work isn’t goin g well, then practice makes perfect.  You’ll just do better next time.

Porter:  It’s not my work.

Eleanor:  Is it your girlfriend?  If your girlfrien d isn’t being nice to you then there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Don’t you see?  Wha tever the problem is, it’s not the end of the world.

Porter:  My biggest problem right now is easy to fi x.

# Recovering from an Illness or Injury

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast 878 : Recovering from an Illness or Injury.

This episode is a dialogue between Julio and Paula about getting injured – having something bad happen to your body. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialog]

Julio:  Hi, Aunt Louisa, it’s Julio.

Paula:  ...And Paula.  I’m on the extension in the kitchen.

Julio:  Anyway, we just wanted to call and wish you  a speedy recovery.  Get plenty of bed rest and take it easy. Avoid greasy o r spicy foods and drink lots of liquids. You don’t want to become dehydrated.

Paula:  Don’t listen to him.  You need to stay acti ve and not get in the habit of sitting around.  You’ll recover faster if you get u p and move around a lot.

Julio:  That’s terrible advice.  She needs rest and  to eat right.  You know what they say: “Feed a cold, starve a fever.”

Paula:  What does that old adage have to do with an ything?  What you need, Aunt Louisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.

Julio:  What are you talking about?  Aunt Louisa ha s a bad cold.

Paula:  What?!  I thought she had a sore back!

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Julio talking on the phone  to his Aunt Luisa. Your “aunt” is the sister of either your mother or your father.  Julio says “Hi, Aunt Luisa, it's Julio.” Also, however, talking on the telephone is Paula. So after Julio says hello

to his aunt, Paula, whose on the extension in the k itchen, says hello. The “extension” is an additional telephone that is conn ected to the same phone number, to the same line, so that two people in one  office or one house can both talk to someone. Of course, this is impossible on a  cell phone, but it is possible when you have the physical phone lines coming into your house or your building. We sometimes call that a “landline” (landline). A “ landline” is, you might call it, an old-fashioned phone. It's not a cellular phone. It' s not a mobile phone. It's a phone that is connected to your house with physical  wires.

Well, Paula and Julio are both talking to their Aun t Luisa. Paula is on the extension in the kitchen. Once again, extension is just another phone in the house or in the building. Julio says, “Anyway, we j ust wanted to call and wish you a speedy recovery.” That use of “anyway” at the beg inning of the sentence is very common in modern conversational English. It ca n be used in a number of different ways. Here it's used to change the subjec t or to return the conversation to the topic you were on before someone else change d it. Julio was talking to his Aunt Luisa and then Paula came in, shifting the att ention of the conversation to her. So, Julio wants to get back control, if you wi ll, of the conversation. So, he says “Anyway,” meaning paying attention to me now, “we just wanted to call and wish you a speedy recovery.” “Speedy” (speedy) mean s quick or fast. “Rapid” would be another term. “Recovery” (recovery) is whe n you get better after feeling sick or after being hurt. “Recovery” is getting bet ter from an illness. A “speedy recovery” would be doing that quickly. Paula and Ju lio are calling to wish their Aunt Luisa a speedy recovery. They're hoping she ge ts better soon.

Julio says, “Get plenty of bed rest and take it eas y.” “Bed rest” is simply lying in your bed, not getting up, not moving. “Take it easy ” is it general expression we use to mean relax. Try not to do anything that's di fficult. Take it easy. Sometimes, we use that expression as a way of saying goodbye t o someone. “Okay, well, it was nice to see you. Take it easy.” You’re really s ort of saying goodbye in that instance.

Here, Julio means exactly what he says. He wants hi s aunt to relax, to not do anything difficult. Then he says, “Avoid greasy or spicy foods.” “Greasy” (greasy) is food with a lot of oil and fat in it, like, I do n't know, duck or certain kinds of pork might be greasy. “Spicy” (spicy) is a very burning hot sensation produced in the mouth, usually by hot peppers. Certain kinds of foo d from certain countries can be spicy. Food from Mexico, for example, can be spi cy. Food from Thailand can be spicy. Lots of different countries have spicy fo ods as part of their traditional food. Julio is telling his aunt to avoid greasy, or  spicy foods. Don't eat them. Avoid them.

He says “Drink lots of liquids.” “Liquids” would be  things like water or milk or soda or tea. Those are all liquids. It's not unusual, for people who are recovering from certain kinds of sicknesses – to give this sort of advice. Julio says, “You don't want to become dehydrated.” “To be dehydrated” (deh ydrated) means to not drink enough water or not drink enough liquid so th at your body feels ill. It feels weak. If you go all day and you don't drink anythin g, any sort of liquid, your body might start to feel weak. It's becoming dehydrated.  “Hydration” has to do with water or liquid. “Dehydration” is when you don't ha ve enough water or liquid.

Paula says, “Don't listen to him.” Don't listen to Julio. “You need to stay active and not get in the habit of sitting around.” So, Pa ula comes on the phone and gives completely opposite advice to her Aunt Luisa.  I think Paula is Julio's sister. Sisters do this sometimes. They think that their br others don't know anything. I think my sister Kathy feels that way about me.

Anyway, Paula gives Aunt Luisa completely different  advice. She tells her to stay active. “To stay active” means to use your body for  physical activities, often to help maintain your health. So go to the gym or exer cise or jog around the block, run around the block. All these are ways of staying  active. “To get into the habit of something” means to get used to something so tha t you do it regularly. You continue to do it without having to think about it.  That's what a “habit” (habit) is. It's something you do all the time, regularly, with out really even thinking about it. I get up in the morning. I brush my teeth. I clean my  teeth. That's a habit. I don't have to write it down to remember. I just know that  that's what I do every morning. That is what Paula is talking about when s he is telling her aunt not to get in the habit of doing something, meaning don't make that a regular part of your day.

What doesn't Paula want her want to do? She doesn't  want her on getting in the habit of “sitting around.” “To sit around” means ju st to sit in a chair and not do anything, have no physical activity.

Paula says, “You'll recover faster” – you'll get be tter faster – “if you get up and move around a lot.” Julio says, “That's terrible ad vice.” That's bad advice, a very bad suggestion. “She needs rest and to eat right.” Julio is saying that is aunt needs to rest in bed and to eat the right foods. “Y ou know what they say, ‘Feed a cold, starve a fever.’” This is an old expression. “To feed” means to give someone food. “Feed a cold” means when someone has a cold, they should continue  to eat. If someone has a “fever” (fever), where their body’s temperature is higher than it should be, then you don't give them food. “To starve” (starve) mean s not to have enough food. In this case, it simply means don't give someone food who has a fever, but if they

have a cold, you should give them food. You should feed them. I don't know if that is correct, however. I'm not a medical doctor ,so please don't take this as advice for your own illnesses and sickness!

Paula says, “What does that old adage have to do wi th anything?” An “adage” (adage) is a saying or a traditional expression. We  might also call it a “proverb” (proverb). Paula says, “What you need, Aunt Luisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.” “To alternate between  something and something else” means to go back and forth. First do one thin g, and then do another thing. In this case, first use a heating pad and then an i ce pack. A “heating pad” (pad) is something that you put on your body to make it warm . It's usually a piece of cloth or fabric that has electrical wires inside of it th at produce heat, so that if you hurt, for example, your leg, you can put this pad on, thi s cloth on, that will get hot and help it relax.

An “ice pack” (pack) is a small container of (usual ly) water that is frozen – that is to say, it's “ice” that is put into a small plastic  container or other small container and put on your body to keep yourself or part of yo ur body cold. For example, if you hurt yourself, you may put an ice pack on it so  that the injury doesn't get any worse or to help it recover. Both heating pads and ice packs are used for (typically) injuries to your muscles, when you hurt  some part of your body related to your muscles.

Julio says, “What are you talking about, Paula? Aun t Lisa has a bad cold.” Aunt Lisa did not hurt her muscles, did not have any sor t of physical injury. Instead, she has a cold, which usually involves having a sor e throat. You might be coughing, have a headache – all of these things are  part of having a cold. A cold is usually not a serious disease or serious illness , I should say.

Paula says, “What? I thought she had a sore back?” “Sore” (sore) is a part of your body that hurts. Paula thought that Aunt Luisa 's problem was a sore back, that she hurt the muscles in her back or some other  part of her back, and that's why she was telling her to stay active and to use a  heating pad or an ice pack. But of course, Julio knows what's going on here. (B rothers usually know more than sisters.) And he says “No, no, she just has a cold.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed

[start of dialog]

Julio:  Hi, Aunt Louisa, it’s Julio.

Paula:  ...And Paula.  I’m on the extension in the kitchen.

Julio:  Anyway, we just wanted to call and wish you  a speedy recovery.  Get plenty of bed rest and take it easy. Avoid greasy o r spicy foods and drink lots of liquids. You don’t want to become dehydrated.

Paula:  Don’t listen to him.  You need to stay acti ve and not get in the habit of sitting around.  You’ll recover faster if you get u p and move around a lot.

Julio:  That’s terrible advice.  She needs rest and  to eat right.  You know what they say: “Feed a cold, starve a fever.”

Paula:  What does that old adage have to do with an ything?  What you need, Aunt Louisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.

Julio:  What are you talking about?  Aunt Louisa ha s a bad cold.

Paula:  What?!  I thought she had a sore back!

# Saying No

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 879: Saying No.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  879. I’m your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and take a look  at our ESL Podcast Store which has some additional courses in English I thin k you will like.

This episode is a dialog between Liang and Christia n about telling someone that you don't want to do something, telling them “no.” Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Liang:  I have a favor to ask.

Christian:  Uh oh, what is it?

Liang:  I’m doing a project for my class in culinar y school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations.

Christian:  Not on your life.

Liang:  But, why?

Christian:  You don’t remember the last time I was your guinea pig?  I was sick for two days.

Liang:  That was a stroke of bad luck.  Come on, pl ease.

Christian:  Count me out.  No amount of pleading is  going to change my mind.  I bet I’m not the first person you’ve asked.

Liang:  Well, no.

Christian:  Who else has turned you down?

Liang:  Jacob said no.

Christian:  I bet he said something stronger than n o.

 Liang:  He said that he would let me cook food for him over his dead body.

Christian:  That’s what I thought.  Did you ask Mel e, too?

Liang:  Yes, and she said she’d rather not.

Christian:  Who’s next on your list of victims, I m ean candidates?

Liang:  You’re my last resort.  If you won’t do it,  then I’m sunk.

Christian:  The answer is still no, but I know some one who won’t turn up his nose at your cooking.

Liang:  Who?

Christian:  Come here, Fido!

[end of dialog]

Liang says to Christian, at the beginning of our di alogue, “I have a favor to ask.” I have something I want you to do for me. Christian s ays, “Uh oh, what is it?” “Uh oh” is an expression that we use when we believe so mething bad is going to happen. In this case, Christian isn't sure what Lia ng is going to ask him. He's a little afraid. Liang says “I'm doing a project for my class in culinary school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations.” A “project” is an assignment, something the teacher told them to do. “Culinary (c ulinary) school” is a school that teaches people how to cook, how to become a ch ef. Liang needs a volunteer – someone who will do it willingly – to taste some of her creations. “Creation” is normally something that you make. It’s sometimes us ed by artists. Here it's being used by Liang to talk about the food that she is go ing to prepare.

Christian says, “Not on your life.” “Not on your li fe” means “no way.” It's a phrase we use to say very strongly that you are not going to do something or something is not going to happen. Liang says, “But why?” Chri stian says, “You don't remember the last time I was your guinea pig?” A “g uinea pig” is literally a small animal, like a hamster. However, in English we use it to mean someone who is asked to try something to see what will happen, som eone who is being used in an experiment. You're not really sure what's going to happen. This is probably because guinea pigs were used in medical experiment s – and perhaps still are, I don't know. But the expression “to be a guinea pig”  means to be someone who is being experimented on, perhaps something that might  be dangerous or

something that might hurt you. Christian says, “I w as sick for two days.” The last time he was Liang's guinea pig, he was sick for two  days.

Christian isn't very interested in helping Liang. L iang says, however, “That was a stroke of bad luck.” A “stroke of bad luck” means i t was a negative experience but it probably won't happen again. It was just bad  luck. It was just an accident. It was something that happened that will probably not happen again. She then says, “Come on, please.” “Come on” is often used in  English to get someone to agree with you or to go with you. In this case, Lia ng wants Christian to agree to taste her creations. Christian says, “Count me out. ” This is another way of saying “no.” “Count me out” means don't include me in that  activity. I don't want to participate. Christian says, “No amount of pleading  is going to change my mind.”

“To plead” (plead) means to beg someone, to ask the m repeatedly, perhaps in a somewhat sad way. Your children might plead with yo u to buy them an ice cream cone or take them to the circus or a carnival, “Oh Dad, please, please, I really want to go, Dad.” That was me when I was younger. W ell, Christian says, “No amount of pleading is going to change my mind.” “No  amount of” is a phrase we use to emphasize that this thing is not going to ha ppen. It doesn't matter what the other person says. So, we put those two together “n o amount” and “pleading,” and we get the idea here that it doesn't matter wha t Liang says or how much she pleads with Christian. He's not going to change his  mind. He's not going to change his opinion, change his decision.

Christian says, “I bet I'm not the first person you ’ve asked,” Christian knows that Liang has gone and asked some of her other friends perhaps, to do what she wants them to do and they probably said “no” too. L iang says, “Well, no…” – no, you're not the first person I've asked.

Christian says, “Who else has turned you down?” “Wh o else” means what other person. “To turn someone down” is a two-word phrasa l verb meaning to say no to someone’s request. Someone asks you to do someth ing and you say “no.” The President of the United States asked me to beco me an ambassador, an official representative of the United States, but I  turned him down. I said “No, Mr. President, I'm very busy here doing ESL Podcast, mu ch more important than anything you have for me.”

Christian wants to know who else has turned Liang d own. Liang says “Jacob said no.” Christian says, “I bet he said something stron ger than no.” “To say something stronger than no” means to say something with more emphasis, not just to say, “Oh no, thank you,” but to say somethi ng that would really indicate that he didn't want to do it. Liang says, “He said that he would let me cook food

for him over his dead body.” That's a popular expre ssion – “to do something over my dead body” or “over his dead body.” The idea is that you will not let this happen. You will not allow this to happen under any  situation, under any circumstances. I would have to be dead before I all ow that. In other words, I would die rather than allow you to do that. So, it' s a very strong way of saying “No, I'm not going to permit this.” I'm not going t o allow this. I'm not going to say yes to this.

Christian says, “That's what I thought. Did you ask  Mele, too?” Liang says, “Yes, and she said she'd rather not.” “Rather not” is a p olite way of saying “no,” when someone asks you to do something. Someone says, “Wo uld you go to the movie with me?” And you say, “Well, I'd rather not. I'm k ind of tired.” It's a more polite way of saying no.”

Christian then asks, “Who's next on your list of vi ctims. I mean, candidates.” A “victim” (victim) is a person who suffers because o f some sort of crime or disease or bad situation – that would be a victim. Christia n also uses the word “candidate.” A “candidate” is someone who's being c onsidered for a job or for a position, something positive, some sort of opportun ity. A candidate could also be someone who wants to be elected to a government pos ition. Christian says, “Who's next” – who's the next person – “on your lis t of victims, I mean, candidates.” He's making a joke. When you want to s ay something bad about someone or criticize something, you may use this fo rm of criticism, or of making a joke that has some sort of criticism in it. For e xample, you're talking to your neighbor and the neighbor has a big dog. It's a hug e dog and you’re a little afraid of it. So, you may say, “So, John how is your lion,  I mean, dog?” A lion, of course, is a big, mean, ferocious animal. You are c omparing the dog to a lion and so you call it a dog, and then you act like it was a mistake. “Oh, I mean” – I meant to say, what I should have said was – “a dog. ” That's how we use that particular structure.

Christian says, “Who's next on your list of victims , I mean, candidates?” Liang says, “You're my last resort.” “To be the last reso rt” (resort) means you're the only remaining option, the only possibility left. L iang says, “If you won't do it” – if you will not do it – “then I'm sunk.” “To be sunk” (sunk) means that you are in a very difficult situation, a situation in which you will probably not succeed, in which you will probably fail.

Christian says, “The answer is still no,” meaning h e is not going to do it, “but I know someone who won't turn up his nose at your coo king.” The expression “to turn up your nose at something,” means that you are  going to say no to something because you think you're too good for tha t offer, that what the person

is offering you is not good enough. “I offered him a thousand dollars to come and fix my car and he turned his nose up at my offer. H e thought that was too low.” It wasn't good enough for him.

More commonly, we use this expression when someone thinks their new better than another person. So, she said no to the man at the bar. She turned his nose up at his offer to go dancing. She thought she was too beautiful for him. That would be a more common use of that expression.

Well, Christian knows someone who will not turn his  nose up at the cooking of Liang. Liang says, “Who?” Christian then says, “Com e here, Fido.” “Fido” (Fido) used to be a common name for a male dog. What of co urse Christian is saying is that his dog will eat Liang's food, but he won't. T hat's not a very nice thing for Christian to say. I feel sorry for poor Liang. “I f eel sorry for her” means I feel badly for her. I hope she finds someone to taste he r cooking.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Liang:  I have a favor to ask.

Christian:  Uh oh, what is it?

Liang:  I’m doing a project for my class in culinar y school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations.

# Forming a Union

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 880: Forming a Union.

This is as a Second Language Podcast episode 880. I 'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educat ional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialog between Norma and Jimmy ab out forming a labor union at their job. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Norma:  What is this?

Jimmy:  It’s a flyer for a meeting I’ve called to t alk about forming a labor union here.

Norma:  Here?  Do you think the management will let  us?

Jimmy:  They can’t stop us.  We’re working longer a nd longer hours and we need to demand higher pay.  We also need better work con ditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.  All of us need to band toge ther to have better bargaining power.

Norma:  I don’t know.  I want to be better paid and  to have job security like everybody else, but I’m afraid of what will happen when we start agitating.

Jimmy:  I’ll tell you what will happen: The managem ent will finally hear what we have to say.  With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we deserve, at long last.  Are you in or out?

Norma:  I’ll have to think about it.

Jimmy:  He who hesitates is lost.

Norma:  Yes, but I was always taught to look before  I leap.

[end of dialog]

 Our dialog begins with Norma asking Jimmy, “What is  this?” Jimmy says “It's a flyer for a meeting.” A “flyer” (flyer) here means a piece of paper that has some text on it, some words on it, perhaps also some ima ges on it. Usually a flyer is one side of a piece of paper that contains informat ion about a meeting or some event that you want people to know about, and perha ps to come to.

Jimmy says “It's a flyer for a meeting I’ve called”  – meaning I have decided to organize – “to talk about forming a labor union her e.” A “labor (labor) union” is an organization of workers, of employees, who get toge ther and decide that they are going to negotiate with their employer, the company  that pays their salaries, together as one big group. The idea here of course,  is that they will have more power, more ability to get what they want in terms of pay and working conditions and so forth. Labor unions have been around for man y years. In the United States, they are not as popular as they are in some  other countries. They are not as popular now as they were even 40, 50 years ago h ere in the United States.

Norma says “Here? Do you think the management will let us?” “The management” refers to the directors of the company,  the bosses, the people who make the decisions, people who would not be conside red part of the union. The union, in this case, would be for the workers who d on't make as much money perhaps, and don't have the same power as the manag ement has. Norma is asking if Jimmy thinks the management will “let us. ” That is, will allow us, will permit us to do this.

Jimmy says “They can't stop us.” “To stop someone” means to prevent them from doing something. Jimmy says “They can't stop us,” t hey cannot stop us. “We’re working longer and longer hours” – longer hours are  more hours – “and we need to demand higher pay.” “To demand something” is to ask for it but in a very forceful way, to insist on it. “You must give me mo re money.” That's a demand. The demand here is for higher pay. “Pay” is the mon ey that you get in your salary, you get from your employer, for the work yo u do. “Higher pay” would be more money.

We all, of course, want higher pay. I want higher p ay. In fact, if I don't get paid more, Center for Educational Development, I'm leavi ng this job. Forget it! I’m out of here. Oh, wait a minute. I actually need this jo b. So, let's continue.

Jimmy continues by saying “We also need better work  conditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.” “Work conditions” re fers to the environment or the situation where you work - is it a safe place to wo rk, for example. Jimmy says the employees need better work conditions and a say in hiring and firing procedures.

“To have a say (say) in something” means to have an  influence on something, an influence in making a decision. Your children don't  have a say in where you're going to eat for dinner tonight. You just say “Chil dren, we’re going to go to this restaurant and you don't have a say in it.” You don 't get to decide – at least, that is the way it was in my family when we went to a re staurant, which wasn't very often.

Jimmy says that the employees should have a say in hiring and firing procedures. “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job. “To fire” (fire) here means to cause someone to lose their job. You're sa ying, “You can no longer work here.” You get rid of an employee. That's “to fire.” So Jimmy wants the employees to have a say in hiring and firing proced ures. “Procedures” are the rules or the steps that you follow to do something.  Jimmy goes on to say, “All of us need to band together to have better bargaining power.” “To band (band) together” means to work together. “Bargaining power ” is how much power, how much strength, if you will, you have in negotiating  with someone else. If you have a bunch of employees, a lot of employees, who get t ogether and say, “We’re not going to work anymore until you give us more money, ” the company may not have a lot of options. They may need you to work ri ght away or they'll lose a lot of money. So they say, “Okay, all right. We'll give yo u more money. We’ll give you a higher salary.” That would be an example of “bargai ning power.” The employees, by banding together, have more bargaining power, mo re negotiating power.

Norma says “I don't know. I want to be better paid and to have job security like everybody else but I'm afraid of what will happen w hen we start agitating.” “Job security” is knowing that you are going to have a j ob next week, that you're not going to be fired. Nowadays, it's very difficult to  get a lot of job security in many companies. Job security is something Norma wants bu t she's afraid of what will happen when we – that is, Jimmy, Norma and the othe r employees – start agitating. “To agitate” (agitate) means to start ca using problems or to start arguing for what you want, to start protesting, to let people know that you want some sort of change in society or in this particula r situation.

Jimmy says, “I'll tell you what will happen. The ma nagement will finally hear what we have to say.” The management will hear our messa ge. “With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we dese rve, at long last.” “Collective bargaining” is the situation I mentioned earlier, w here everyone gets together and you negotiate with the employer as a group. The bos s doesn't talk to one person and then another person and then another person and  negotiate or come to an agreement on their salary individually. The boss ha s to negotiate with the entire group, as one unit, if you will. That's collective bargaining.

“Collective” is an adjective meaning altogether as a group. “The rank (rank) and file (file)” refers to the ordinary employees or or dinary members of an organization, not the leaders, not the people in ch arge, not the management, in this case. “At long last” means finally after a lon g period of waiting. Jimmy is saying that with collective bargaining the rank and  file “will get what we deserve, at long last.” Then he asks Norma, “Are you in or o ut?” That expression, “in or out,” is used to ask someone whether they're going to participate or not. “Are you going to join us or not?” Norma says, “I'll have to  think about it.”

Jimmy uses an old expression in response. He says, “He who hesitates is lost.” “To hesitate” means to wait before making a decisio n, to go, “Oh, well, I'm not sure,” and you think about it for a while before yo u decide yes or no. “To be lost” means that you will lose the opportunity, that if y ou wait too long, the idea is, you won't be able to take advantage of the opportunity.  So, if you're at a party and you see a beautiful girl in the room and you are th inking about going over and talking to her, if you hesitate too long, if you wa it too long, some other gentlemen will walk up and talk to her and you will lose the opportunity. “He who hesitates is lost.”

Norma says, “Yes, but I was always taught to look b efore I leap.” Norma responds with another old saying, “to look before y ou leap” (leap). “To leap” means to jump, especially if you're jumping off a h igh place onto a lower place. “To look before you leap” means to make sure you kn ow where you're going. If you jump off of a very high place, you could hurt y ourself. So, you need to look before you leap to make sure it's a good decision. This is sort of the opposite of the other expression, “He who hesitates is lost.” “ To look before you leap” means to consider something carefully, to consider your d ecisions carefully before making them.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Norma:  What is this?

Jimmy:  It’s a flyer for a meeting I’ve called to t alk about forming a labor union here.

Norma:  Here?  Do you think the management will let  us?

Jimmy:  They can’t stop us.  We’re working longer a nd longer hours and we need to demand higher pay.  We also need better work con ditions and a say in hiring

and firing procedures.  All of us need to band toge ther to have better bargaining power.

Norma:  I don’t know.  I want to be better paid and  to have job security like everybody else, but I’m afraid of what will happen when we start agitating.

Jimmy:  I’ll tell you what will happen: The managem ent will finally hear what we have to say.  With collective bargaining, the rank and file will get what we deserve, at long last.  Are you in or out?

Norma:  I’ll have to think about it.

Jimmy:  He who hesitates is lost.

Norma:  Yes, but I was always taught to look before  I leap.

This episode is a dialog between Ralph and Nicky, a bout eating what is called genetically modified foods. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Ralph:  What’s that?

Nicky:  It’s a bigger and better tomato.  It’s been  genetically modified.

Ralph:  You’re not going to eat that, are you?

Nicky:  Of course I am.  I’m making a salad.  Want one?

Ralph:  No way.  I don’t want to eat something that ’s been genetically engineered in a laboratory.  Who knows what kind of strange DN A it has.

Nicky:  It’s perfectly safe.  It’s been modified to  grow faster, have more nutrients, and be resistant to disease and pests.

Ralph:  And it may contain strange mutations as par t of its genetic makeup that they didn’t tell you about.  I really wouldn’t eat that if I were you.

Nicky:  Where did you get this aversion to genetica lly modified foods?  Scientists and farmers have always used selective breeding wit h animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food.  This is nothing differ ent.

Ralph:  Of course it is.  And just because it’s big ger, doesn’t mean it’s better.  I’ll eat food that’s been modified by the only person I trust.

Nicky:  Who’s that?

 Ralph:  Mother Nature!

[end of dialog]

Our dialog begins with Ralph saying to Nicky, “What ’s that?” Nicky says “It's a bigger and better tomato.” A tomato is something th at you might eat with a salad or on a sandwich, or use to make sauce for your pas ta. Nicky says “It's a bigger and better tomato. It's been genetically modified.”  “To modify” (modify) means to change something. “To genetically modify something”  means to change the genes, if you will, the components of a plant or an  animal that determine what kind of plant and animal that is. “Genes” (genes) a re what we might call the building blocks of life. They’re the basic componen ts, the elements that life is constructed on. It's hard to explain that in a very  complete manner here, but that's what “genetically” means related to your gen es.

Ralph says, “You're not going to eat that, are you? ” Ralph doesn't think Nicky should eat it. Nicky says, “Of course I am. I'm mak ing a salad. Want one?” – meaning do you want one? Ralph says, “No way.” “No way” is a very strong way of saying “No, absolutely not.” “No way. I don't wa nt to eat something that's been genetically engineered in a laboratory.” “To engine er,” (engineer) as a verb, means to change, to usually change the structure of  something. “Genetically engineered” would be something where scientists hav e changed the genetic makeup, the genetic composition of that particular plant or animal. A “laboratory” is a place where scientists do experiments.

Ralph says, “Who knows what kind of strange DNA it has.” “DNA” is the chemical substance that carries the genetic information. It' s what carries the information from our genes that affects our eye color, our skin  color, our physical makeup and so forth. Nicky says that, “This tomato is perf ectly safe.” It's completely safe. “It's been modified to grow faster, have more nutri ents and be resistant to disease and pests.”

So, Nicky is saying the tomato is safe. “It has bee n changed only to make it grow faster to give it more nutrients, and to make it re sistant to disease and pests.” “Nutrients” (nutrients) is a general word used to d escribe the substances or the elements within a plant that help you grow, that an imals eat, or humans eat that helps their body grow better. It could be a lot of different things. Each food would have different kinds of nutrients.

Nicky says that the tomato was also modified to be resistant to disease and pests. “To be resistant” means that you are not eas ily damaged by something,

you are not easily harmed by something. “Disease” i s the same as sickness or illness, when something is not growing and function ing the way it should. “Pests” (pests) are insects or small animals that destroy p lants, that destroy the plants that we use to get food from. So pests are always b ad things, whether they’re mosquitoes or rodents or any other sort of animal t hat is going to harm the plants that we are growing to eat.

Ralph says, “And it may contain strange mutations a s part of its genetic makeup that they don't tell you about.” Ralph is saying th at these genetically modified foods are dangerous because they may contain strang e mutations. A “mutation” (mutation) is a genetic change that makes one indiv idual different from another individual. But it's not, if you will, a change tha t you would expect to take place. So, usually mutation, when we're talking about scie nce fiction, for example, is when something changes in some weird way, some stra nge way that is considered dangerous or unusual. Mutation is part o f the way that the world works in terms of DNA and genes, but here Ralph is using the word as a negative, as a criticism of this genetically modifi ed food. Ralph says that these mutations could be part of the tomatoes’ genetic ma keup. We’ve already talked about what “genetic” refers to. “Makeup” (makeup) –  one word – refers to composition what something is made of. Ralph says, “I really wouldn't eat that if I were you.” That's a common expression, “If I were y ou” – if I were in your situation, I would not do that.

Nicky says, “Where did you get this aversion to gen etically modified foods?” An “aversion” (aversion) is a hatred or strong dislike  of something, something that you would want to avoid. Nicky says, “Scientists an d farmers have always used selective breeding with animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food. This is nothing different.” “Selective breeding” (b reeding) is the practice of making plants or animals reproduce, or produce new plants or animals that have particular characteristics that you want to increas e.

So, if you have two different kinds of dogs and you  want to make a dog that is a mixture of these two kinds of dogs, well, you would  put the two dogs together – one would have to be male and one would have to be female, of course – and let them do what they do, and then you would “breed” a new animal, a combination of these two different animals. “Selective breeding ” is using that basic logic, that basic process with plants or animals, in order to p roduce plants or animals that have certain characteristics. That's what Nicky say s farmers and scientists have been doing for many years and that this is nothing different.

Ralph says, “Of course it is.” “And just because it 's bigger” – meaning, the tomato – “doesn't mean it's better. I'll eat food that's b een modified by the only person I

trust.” “To trust” means to believe, in this case, or to rely on. Nicky asked, “Who’s that?” – who is that person that you trust? Ralph r esponds, “Mother Nature.” Mother Nature is not a real person. We say “Mother Nature” to refer to the idea that the whole world, the natural world is somehow controlled by this female figure, I guess. Mother Nature refers to the way the environment is, the way nature is without people interfering with it, witho ut men and women making changes to the environment. That's basically the id ea behind this term “Mother Nature.”

Ralph treats Mother Nature as a real person that he  can trust. What he's really saying here is that he only wants to eat food that is somehow natural, that doesn't have any sort of either chemicals, perhaps,  or genetic modifications that would change the way the food is produced.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Ralph:  What’s that?

Nicky:  It’s a bigger and better tomato.  It’s been  genetically modified.

Ralph:  You’re not going to eat that, are you?

Nicky:  Of course I am.  I’m making a salad.  Want one?

Ralph:  No way.  I don’t want to eat something that ’s been genetically engineered in a laboratory.  Who knows what kind of strange DN A it has.

Nicky:  It’s perfectly safe.  It’s been modified to  grow faster, have more nutrients, and be resistant to disease and pests.

Ralph:  And it may contain strange mutations as par t of its genetic makeup that they didn’t tell you about.  I really wouldn’t eat that if I were you.

Nicky:  Where did you get this aversion to genetica lly modified foods?  Scientists and farmers have always used selective breeding wit h animals and crops to bring you bigger and better food.  This is nothing differ ent.

Ralph:  Of course it is.  And just because it’s big ger, doesn’t mean it’s better.  I’ll eat food that’s been modified by the only person I trust.

Nicky:  Who’s that?

Ralph:  Mother Nature!

# Playing a Practical Joke

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 882: Playing a Practical Joke

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 882. I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Patricia and Lui s about someone playing a practical joke on someone else. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Patricia:  What are you doing?

Luis:  I’m setting up a practical joke for Bobby.  I can’t wait to see the look on his face when he walks outside and finds his bike in pi eces.  It’ll be the best prank ever!

Patricia:  You’re not really going to take apart hi s bike, are you?

Luis:  I’ll let you in on the joke.  He’ll just be looking at spare parts.  I’ve hidden his bike in the garage.

Patricia:  He’s really going to freak out when he t hinks that you’ve run over his bike with the car, though.  I think this is more cr uel than mischievous.

Luis:  Lighten up!  When he realizes he’s the butt of the joke, he’ll think it’s hilarious, trust me.

Patricia:  Couldn’t you just play some other kind o f practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion?

Luis:  A whoopee cushion?  That’s child’s play.  Th is practical joke is worthy of a master prankster!

[end of dialog]

Patricia begins our dialogue by saying to Luis, “Wh at are you doing?” Luis says, “I'm setting up a practical joke for Bobby.” “To se t (set) up” is a phrasal verb meaning I'm getting ready, I'm getting organized, I 'm putting together. Luis is putting together a practical joke. A “joke” is when  someone says something funny. It could be a story. It could be something e lse that makes us laugh. A “practical joke” is some sort of physical action, s ome sort of trick, that’s supposed to be funny. The trick is always on another person.  So, you do something so that the other person looks silly or foolish, not very i ntelligent. That's what a practical joke tries to do. It tries to make another person l ook silly, look ridiculous.

Well, Luis is setting up a practical joke for Bobby . We often use the verb “to play a practical joke,” which is in the title of this ep isode. Luis is going to play a practical joke for Bobby or “on” Bobby. “I can't wa it to see the look on his face,” Luis says, when he walks outside and finds his bike  in pieces. The expression “I can't wait to something” means I'm really looking f orward to something. In this case, Luis is looking forward to “the look on Bobby 's face” when he sees what has happened. He's looking forward to the reaction that Bobby will have when he walks outside – outside of their building, where th ey’re working probably – and finds, or discovers, his bicycle “in pieces.”

When we say something is “in pieces” (pieces), we m ean it has been taken apart. It has been disassembled with all the individual pi eces laying on the ground, or on the floor. So Luis has taken Bobby's bike and he  has taken it apart. He has just assembled that and now the bike is in pieces.

Luis says, “It will be the best prank ever.” A “pra nk” (prank) is another word for a practical joke. More recently on a popular televisi on program, instead of using the term practical joke or prank, they use the verb “to  punk” (punk). “To punk” here means the same as to play a practical joke on someo ne. In the television show “Punk’d,” they play practical jokes on famous peopl e, typically on celebrities.

Patricia says, “You're not really going to take apa rt his bike, are you?” Luis says, “I'll let you in on the joke.” “To let someone in o n a joke” means to let someone know how you are going to do your practical joke, h ow you're going to play your practical joke, giving them the details of what is going to happen. Of course, Bobby doesn't know what’s going to happen.

Luis is going to tell Patricia. Luis says, “Bobby w ill just be looking at spare parts.” “Spare (spare) parts” are things that you use, typi cally, when you have a machine and it breaks down, you need to fix just part of the machine. We would call the thing you use to fix it with, that you replace the old thing that doesn't work with, “spare parts.” Luis is saying that when Bobby sees his bicycle, it will look like it's

just a bunch of parts, just a bunch of pieces. “I'v e hidden his bike in the garage,” Luis says.

So now we understand what Luis is doing. He's not actually  going to take Bobby's bike and take it all apart and leave it on the ground. He's going to take some spare parts, some other parts of another bicyc le, and put that on the ground, or I should say put those on the ground, those  parts on the ground. Bobby's real bike will not be the one on the ground . It will be in the garage. That's the joke.

Patricia says, “He's really going to freak out when  he thinks that you've run over his bike with the car, though.” So, that's the tric k. Luis is going to pretend like he ran over the bike. “To run over” means to hit and a ctually have the, in this case, car drive over the bicycle, which of course, I don' t recommend, if you have a bicycle – or least you should get off the bicycle b efore someone runs it over.

Anyway, Patricia is talking about how Bobby is goin g to “freak out.” “To freak (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become very upset, very angry, to lose control of yourself. It's an informa l way of saying to go wild or to go crazy, to be so angry you start yelling and screami ng.

Patricia says, “I think this is more cruel than mis chievous.” “Cruel” (cruel) means very mean – when you are trying to hurt another per son. “Cruel” is something that is not kind. “Mischievous” (mischievous) is us ed to describe a thing or person who is causing problems or causing trouble, but usually in a fun way, or at least in order to be funny. It's an adjective we  would most typically use with children who are getting into trouble. They’re not bad children (except my neighbors children). But they’re children that are causing problems.

Luis says to Patricia, “Lighten up.” This expressio n “lighten (lighten) up” is a phrasal verb meaning relax. Don't take things so se riously. Don't get so excited. Try to have more fun.

Luis says, “When Bobby realizes he's the butt of the joke, he'll think it's hilarious, trust me.” “To be the butt (butt) of the joke” mean s you are the person that people are laughing at. You are the person who has had thi s practical joke played on, or more grammatically, on whom the practical joke has been played. Luis says, “Bobby will think it's hilarious.” “Hilarious” (hil arious) means very funny.

So, Bobby will think this is very funny. That's wha t Luis says. He says, “Trust me,” meaning believe me. I know what I'm talking ab out here, Patricia. Lighten up, Patricia, seriously.

 Patricia says, “Couldn’t you just play some other k ind of practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion?” A “whoopee (whoopee) cushi on (cushion)” is basically a small rubber bag that has one opening in the bag so that when you sit on it, it makes a noise. It makes a funny noise. The ideas th at you would put this cushion underneath someone, and they wouldn't realize they were going to sit on it, and then when they sit down it makes a funny noise. It' s the sort of thing you would see in an old 1930’s or 1940’s movie, perhaps.

Luis says, “A whoopee cushion? That's child's play. ” The expression “child's play” means something is very easy to do, something doesn 't require any planning. It's too easy. That's the idea. Luis says, “This practic al joke is worthy of a master prankster.” “To be worthy of something” means it's good enough for, or it's appropriate for. Luis is saying this joke is so goo d, that it is something that you would only expect normally from a master prankster.  A “master” here means an expert, someone who knows a lot about something. A “prankster” is a person who plays practical jokes on other people. A “prank ster” is a person who is always creating these pranks to make other people l ook foolish.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Patricia:  What are you doing?

Luis:  I’m setting up a practical joke for Bobby.  I can’t wait to see the look on his face when he walks outside and finds his bike in pi eces.  It’ll be the best prank ever!

Patricia:  You’re not really going to take apart hi s bike, are you?

Luis:  I’ll let you in on the joke.  He’ll just be looking at spare parts.  I’ve hidden his bike in the garage.

Patricia:  He’s really going to freak out when he t hinks that you’ve run over his bike with the car, though.  I think this is more cr uel than mischievous.

Luis:  Lighten up!  When he realizes he’s the butt of the joke, he’ll think it’s hilarious, trust me.

Patricia:  Couldn’t you just play some other kind o f practical joke, maybe with a whoopee cushion?

 Luis:  A whoopee cushion?  That’s child’s play.  Th is practical joke is worthy of a master prankster!

This episode is a dialogue between Mrs. Mason and C arl about taking care of a difficult child. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Mrs. Mason:  So, how did things go?

Carl:  Well...

Mrs. Mason:  What’s the matter?  Didn’t you and Jas on have a good time while I was away?

Carl:  It was interesting.  He was a little willful .

Mrs. Mason:  Yes, he can be a little strong-willed at times, but if you just do what he wants or give him what he wants, he’s just fine.

Carl:  He wanted to eat all of the cookies and I to ld him no.  He threw a tantrum.

Mrs. Mason:  A tantrum?  My son can be stubborn, bu t he never throws tantrums. What did he do exactly?

Carl:  Well, he threw his toys against the wall, ju mped the couch while shrieking at the top of his lungs, and he tried to bite my ha nd.

Mrs. Mason:  Oh, he was just expressing his displea sure, that’s all.  You don’t want children to bottle up their feelings.  You sho uld just have given him the cookies to pacify him.

Carl:  Really?  I didn’t want to spoil him, and eat ing all of those cookies wouldn’t be good for him.  He seemed to have too much energy  already, and he didn’t need another sugar rush.

Mrs. Mason:  Next time, you should just do what he wants.  He’ll grow out of this willful stage soon.

Carl:  Next time?

Mrs. Mason:  Yes, didn’t you say you could babysit Jason again on Saturday night?

Carl:  Oh, I’d made a mistake.  I have another comm itment on Saturday night.

Mrs. Mason:  That’s too bad.  We’ll call you the ne xt time we need a babysitter.

Carl:  Sure, I can’t wait.

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Mrs. Mason asking Carl, “H ow did things go?” “How did things g?” means “What happened?” You're usually re ferring to some specific event or situation that is now in the past, and you  want to find out whether things went well, whether the situation turned out to be a  good one or not.

Carl says, “Well…” Mrs. Mason says “What's the matt er?” – what's wrong – “Didn't you and Jason have a good time while I was away?” We learn that Carl is the babysitter. A “babysitter” is someone who looks  after your child, who takes care of your child while you go somewhere else. Nor mally, babysitters are women or high school girls. That's the sort of trad itional babysitter, but there are some boys and men, I guess, who babysit.

I babysat once. I babysat my two nieces, Corrie and  Molly, and that was many, many years ago. They were very young. One of them w as maybe, I don't know, three or four, and the other one was only, well, wa s still a baby, and it’s pretty much the worst experience of my life, I think. I th ink I can say that.

Anyway, Carl is a babysitter. He's taking care of M rs. Mason’s son, Jason. Carl says “It was interesting” – his experience with Jas on. “Jason,” he says, “was a little willful.” “To be willful (willful)” means to  be stubborn, not to do what you are supposed to do. Carl says that Jason was a little w illful. Mrs. Mason says, “Yes. He can be a little strong-willed at times.” “To be strong-willed” means the same

as to be willful, means to be stubborn, but it coul d also mean to have a lot of determination, a lot of persistence . So, it can be  a positive thing – strong-willed. “Willful” is almost always a negative thing.

Mrs. Mason says, “If you just do what he wants or g ive him what he wants, he's just fine.” Mrs. Mason is saying that if you give h er son everything he wants, he'll be fine, which of course, is true for all children.  If you always give them what they want, they’ll never cry, but then you'll have some really terrible children. So, you have to decide, right?

Carl says, “He wanted to eat all of the cookies and  I told him no.” Jason wanted to eat all of the cookies, the sweets. Carl said he  couldn't do that and so Jason “threw a tantrum.” “To throw a tantrum (tantrum)” m eans to behave very badly, very angrily. It's something that you would expect a small child to do. Mrs. Mason says that “A tantrum? My son can be stubborn,” that  is, willful, not willing to change his mind, not willing to compromise, “but he  never throws tantrums.”

So, Mrs. Mason asked Carl, “What did he do exactly? ” Carl says, “Well, he threw his toys against the wall.” He picked up his toys a nd threw them against the wall. “He jumped on the couch,” the sofa, “while shriekin g at the top of his lungs.” “To shriek” (shriek) means to yell very loudly, very lo udly. “At the top of your lungs” means very loudly. So, “to shriek at the top your l ungs” is a little redundant. It’s saying someone yelled very, very loudly. Some child ren are of course, capable of yelling very, very loudly. Not me. I was never a ch ild that would yell loudly. As the youngest child, I was always calm, always peaceful.  Well, unless you ask my mother. She'll probably tell you a different story.  Anyway, back to our story.

Carl says that Jason, in addition to shrieking, “tr ied to bite his hand.” “To bite” (bite) is to use your teeth to try to eat something , usually to take a piece of food off of a larger piece of food. Mrs. Mason says, “Oh , Jason was just expressing his displeasure. That's all.” “To express your disp leasure” means to indicate how you are not happy with the situation, to indicate h ow unhappy you are. Normally, this expression, “to express one's displeasure,” is  used when talking about adults who are showing their disagreement or their dislike  of the situation. It's not something we would use to describe a child.

What Mrs. Mason is doing, of course, is defending J ason, saying that he isn’t such a bad child. Mrs. Mason says, “You don't want children to bottle up their feelings.” “To bottle (bottle) up your feelings” me ans to hide your emotions, not to express what you’re really feeling.

For example, if you’re feeling sad but you don't te ll anyone that, and you instead act happy, in some ways you are bottling up your fe elings. Or if you are angry with someone and you don't express that, you don't show that, you hide those emotions, you could be described as “bottling up yo ur feelings.”

Now, bottling up your feelings is usually considere d a bad thing. However, as we know, to be an adult you have to hide your emotions  often, and you probably should in many cases. Some parents believe, however , that their children should be able to express whatever emotion they’re feeling  and that's just okay. My parents did not believe that, I can assure you. “Tr ust me,” we would say – believe me.

Mrs. Mason, however, believes it's not a good idea for her son to bottle up his feelings. She says to Carl, “You should have just g iven him the cookies to pacify him.” “To pacify” (pacify) means to calm down, to m ake someone feel more relaxed, especially somebody who's angry or upset. That's the meaning here anyway. “To pacify” is a verb that we would probabl y use once again, more often than not, for a child or children.

Carl says “Really? I didn't want to spoil him.” “To  spoil (spoil) someone” is to give a child everything he or she wants, so that the chi ld never learns any discipline, never learns that he or she has to accept a “no” so metimes in life. There are, of course, many parents who spoil their children, who give their children everything they want and then they grow up and they become my neighbor, and well, it's not a happy situation. But I moved recently so I'm actu ally talking about my old neighbor, not my new neighbors. My new neighbors ar e great…except for the dog that is always making noise. Otherwise, they're  wonderful! (Well, and their cars sometimes is in my way, but really, they're pr etty good.)

Carl thinks that Jason seem to have too much energy  and he didn't want to give him another cookie, so that he would have a “sugar rush.” A “sugar rush” is a temporary feeling of having a lot of energy that yo u get when you eat or drink something with a lot of sugar in it.

Mrs. Mason says, “Next time, you should just do wha t he wants. He will grow out of this willful stage soon.” “To grow out of someth ing” means to become older, to become more mature, to no longer do the sorts of ba d things that you might have done when you were younger. Mrs. Mason thanks Jason  will grow out of this willful stage, this willful period in his developme nt as a child.

Carl says, “Next time?” Mrs. Mason says, “Yes. Didn 't you say you could babysit Jason again on Saturday night?” “To babysit,” we've  already defined, is to take

care of a young child, especially for his or her pa rent who isn't there. Carl says, “Oh, I've made a mistake. I have another commitment  on Saturday night.”

“To have another commitment” means you have another  appointment, another date, another situation where you have to go somewh ere, and in this case it means Carl won't be able to babysit Jason again. Mr s. Mason says, “That's too bad. We’ll call you next time we need a babysitter. ” Carl says, “Sure. I can't wait.” Of course, Carl doesn't really want to babysit Jaso n ever again, but he's being polite when he says “he can't wait.” Normally that' s an expression you say when you're looking forward to something, but Carl is de finitely not looking forward to babysitting Jason again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialog]

Mrs. Mason:  So, how did things go?

Carl:  Well...

Mrs. Mason:  What’s the matter?  Didn’t you and Jas on have a good time while I was away?

Carl:  It was interesting.  He was a little willful .

Mrs. Mason:  Yes, he can be a little strong-willed at times, but if you just do what he wants or give him what he wants, he’s just fine.

Carl:  Sure, I can’t wait.

This episode is a dialogue about different kinds of  businesses meetings. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Susanna:  All right, then.  This meeting is over.  We’ll meet again next week for a status update.

Juan:  Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about  tomorrow’s teleconference?

Susanna:  Sorry, I’ve got to run.  I’m late for my department’s weekly brainstorming session.  Can it wait?

Juan:  Sure, how about a lunch meeting?

Susanna:  I can’t.  I’m holding personnel meetings over lunch all this week.  It’s the only way I can fit them in.

Juan:  Okay, how about at 3:00 this afternoon?

Susanna:  Sorry, I have a standing meeting with the  directors once a month at that time.  Can you come by after the pitch meeting  at 4:30?

Juan:  I wish I could, but our department head has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon to do some damage control after the shareholder meeting debacle last week.  Well, how about a dinner meetin g?

Susanna:  Only if we can have dinner at 9:30.  I wo n’t be finished here until then.

Juan:  Do you ever get a breather?

 Susanna:  A breather?  I think I’m due for one...in  2030.

[end of dialog]

Susanna says to Juan, “All right then. This meeting  is over.” So she's ending a meeting that she is leading, she is “running,” we m ight say. Susanna says, “We’ll meet again next week for a status update.” An “upda te” (update) is news about something that has happened. You've already had som e situation going on, some event taking place, and now you want the lates t news. Usually it's information about how things have changed. A “statu s (status) update” would be news about how a project is progressing, how it's m oving toward its goal. You're giving news about some sort of business project tha t you're working on.

Juan says, “Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about tomorrow's teleconference?” A “teleconference” is a meeting wh ere you are talking to people on the telephone, usually several people are talkin g on the telephone at the same time. That's a teleconference. Susanna says “S orry, I've got to run.” When someone says they've “got to run,” they mean they h ave to leave right now – usually leave the building or leave the area where they are.

Susanna says, “I'm late for my department's weekly brainstorming session.” A “session” (session) is another word for a meeting. It would probably be used in a business context when talking about a meeting, but also in a medical context, especially if you are going to a therapist, a psych otherapist, or a counselor. Those are often called “counseling sessions,” where  you’re meeting with the doctor. Susanna is going to her department's weekly  brain storming session.

“To brainstorm” (brainstorm) – one word – means to try to generate, think of, come up with as many ideas as you can about a certa in topic. When you brainstorm, usually one person is writing down all of the ideas, and you don't discuss the ideas when people are proposing them. Y ou simply give your idea and everyone gives their ideas, and then at the end , you decide which are the good ideas and the bad ideas. Susanna says, “Can it  wait?” Can your questions wait, Juan? I've got a meeting to go to.

Juan says “Sure. How about a lunch meeting?” A “lun ch meeting” would of course be a meeting that you would have over the lu nchtime. You would go somewhere to eat and also talk about whatever busin ess topic it is you need to talk about. Susanna says, “I can't. I'm holding per sonnel meetings over lunch all

this week.” “Personnel” (personnel) is another word  for employees – the people who work for a company. The personnel of a company are the employees of the company. It's a little more formal, business-like w ord, but it means the same as “employees.”

Susanna says, “It's the only way I can fit them in”  – that is, having these personnel meetings over lunch is the only way she c an fit them in. “To fit something in” is a phrasal verb meaning to find tim e to do something in your very busy schedule. You have many things happening today . Somebody wants to talk to you and you don't have time on your schedule, bu t you decide “to fit them in.” You say, “Okay. I can meet you for five minutes in between this meeting and that meeting.” You're fitting them in. Juan says, “Okay.  How about at three o'clock this afternoon?” Juan really  wants to have this meeting, right? Juan says “How about at three o'clock this afternoon?” Susanna says, “So rry. I have a standing meeting with the directors once a month at that time.” A “s tanding meeting” is a meeting that occurs on a regular basis. It's a scheduled me eting that you have every week or every month or maybe every year, but it's a  meeting that occurs at the same time and that is regularly scheduled.

Susanna then says, “Can you come by” – that is, can  you come to my office – “after the pitch meeting at 4:30?” A “pitch (pitch)  meeting” is a meeting where someone is trying to get their ideas approved by so meone else. Someone is proposing a project and they are presenting their p roposal, their information, to the people who will make a decision, usually to the  bosses, in this case. The verb “to pitch” means, in this case, to try to convince someone to accept or adopt your ideas. Usually, “pitches” – in this case, as a noun  – are things that you do to try to get someone to either buy something or to give y ou money for some project that you want to work on.

Juan says, “I wish I could,” meaning I wish I could  come by after the pitch meeting at 4:30, “but our department head (the lead er of our department) has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon.” An  “emergency” is some serious situation that takes place without any warn ing, without any planning. It's something that happens suddenly, often unexpectedly . So an emergency meeting would be a meeting that you weren't plannin g on having, but you need to have because there is some sort of serious situatio n you have to take care of.

Juan says this emergency meeting is to do some “dam age control after the shareholder meeting debacle last week.” The express ion “damage (damage) control” means you are trying to minimize or reduce , lessen, the negative consequences of something that has happened. You're  trying to make sure it doesn't get any worse. So, if a company, for exampl e, makes a product, makes

something and it doesn't work, and it sells it to p eople and people complain about the product, the company will try to do damage cont rol. They will say, “Okay, we made a mistake here. Let's do something so that the  mistake doesn't get any bigger or that it doesn't cause us any more problem s. Maybe we’ll give the money back to everyone who bought this product.” Th at would be a form of damage control.

Juan says his department needs to do damage control  after the “shareholder meeting debacle” last week. Your “shareholders” are  the people who own shares or stock in your company. Shares or stocks are part ial ownership in a company. “To be a shareholder” means to be someone who owns shares, owns stock in a company. So, a stockholder meeting would be a meeti ng of all the people who have stock in that company, who have a partial owne rship of the company. A “debacle” (debacle) is another word for a disaster,  something that goes wrong, very, very wrong.

Juan says, “Well, how about a dinner meeting?” How about having a meeting over dinner, at night? Susanna says, “Only if we ca n have dinner at 9:30. I won't be finished until then.” Juan says, “Do you ever ge t a breather?” – meaning, do you ever get a break from your work, Susanna? Becau se you're working too hard, Susanna, seriously. Juan says, “Do you ever g et a breather?” Susanna says, “A breather? I think I'm due for one in 2030. ”

“To be due (due) for something” means that you are expecting and deserving to have something. It's something that is, we may say,  “owed you” – something that you are supposed to get. “I'm due for a vacation.” That would mean I am expecting a vacation soon. I deserve this vacation.  I'm owed this vacation.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Susanna:  All right, then.  This meeting is over.  We’ll meet again next week for a status update.

Juan:  Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about  tomorrow’s teleconference?

Susanna:  Sorry, I’ve got to run.  I’m late for my department’s weekly brainstorming session.  Can it wait?

Juan:  Sure, how about a lunch meeting?

Susanna:  I can’t.  I’m holding personnel meetings over lunch all this week.  It’s the only way I can fit them in.

Juan:  Okay, how about at 3:00 this afternoon?

# Talking to a Bank Teller

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 885 - Talking to a Bank Teller.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 885. I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between a person who wor ks at a bank and Antonio. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Bank Teller:  Can I help you?

Antonio:  Yes, I’d like to deposit this check.

Bank Teller:  Please fill out a deposit slip and be  sure to endorse the check on the back.

Antonio:  Here you are.  I’ve already filled out a slip and signed the check.  I’d also like to cash this other check.

Bank Teller: Sure, I can help you with that.  Here you are.  Here’s a receipt for your deposit and I’ve cashed your check.  Let me co unt out your $100:  20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

Antonio:  Thanks.  Could I also check my bank balan ce for my other account?

Bank Teller:  No problem.  You just have to swipe y our ATM card and enter your PIN.  It looks like you have a balance of $1,752.  Will that be all?

Antonio:  Oh, I have that much?  I’d like to withdr aw $80.

Bank Teller:  All right.  You’ll need to fill out a  withdrawal slip.  Why don’t you step aside while you do that so I can help the next cust omer, and when you’re done, come back to this window and I’ll help you.

Antonio:  Okay, I’ll do that.  And if I want to tra nsfer money between accounts?

Bank Teller:  You’ll need to fill out a withdrawal slip for the first account and a deposit slip for the second.

Antonio:  Got it.  This might take awhile.

Bank Teller:  No problem, sir.  We’re here all day – at least until 5:00.

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with the bank teller saying to Antonio, “Can I help you?” The “teller” is usually the man or woman who you talk t o if you want to put money into your bank account or take money out of your bank ac count. Antonio says, “Yes. I'd like to deposit this check.” Antonio wants to p ut money into his bank account. That's what he means when he says he wants to “depo sit” something. In this case, he's depositing a “check.” A “check” is usual ly written on a small piece of paper that authorizes the bank to take money from o ne person's bank account and give it to another person. When you have to pay  your electrical bill or your gas bill, you may write a check. You may write on a  piece of paper and sign it in order to transfer money from your account to the pe rson or the company you are paying.

Antonio is depositing the check into his bank accou nt. The bank teller says, “Please fill out a deposit slip (slip) and be sure to endorse the check on the back.” A “deposit slip” is a piece of paper that yo u write your account information on so that the teller knows where to put this check , in whose account to put it. “Slip” is just another word for small piece of pape r. “To endorse (endorse) a check” means to sign the back of the check. Banks u sually require, though not always, that if you are going to take a check and d eposit it into your account, you have to sign the back of it to prove that you are w ho you say you are. Antonio is asked to endorse the check on the back, on the back  of the piece of paper.

Antonio does that and then says, “Here you are,” gi ving the check to the teller. “I've already filled out a slip and signed the chec k.” “To sign” means to endorse, in this case. “I'd also like to cash this other che ck.” So, now we learn Antonio has two  checks. One of them, he wants to deposit; one of t hem, he wants to cash. The verb “to cash” (cash) means typically to exchan ge a check for currency, for dollars and coins, something that you can use and s pend wherever you'd like. “Cashing a check” means getting money from a check that you can spend somewhere else. That's what Antonio wants to do. He  wants to cash this check.

Notice also that “cash” is a noun referring to curr ency, referring to money – money in the form of either paper money, bills or c oins.

The bank teller says, “Sure. I can help you with th at. Here you are. Here's a receipt for your deposit.” The bank teller takes the check from Antonio and gives Antonio a “receipt” (receipt) (the “p” is silent). The “receipt” is a piece of paper saying that you have, in this case, deposited this amount of money into your bank account.

In general, a receipt is a piece of paper, usually,  that summarizes whatever financial transaction took place. So, if you go to a restaurant and you give the waiter or the waitress, the server, your credit car d, he or she brings that back and you sign it, and you take a receipt. This is a summ ary of the money that you just spent. Nowadays, receipts can also be electronic. T hey can send you an email. If you go in to some stores, instead of giving you a p aper receipt, they will offer you the option of sending you a receipt by email. Of co urse, the real reason they offer to do this is because they want your email address so they can send you some advertisements later.

The bank teller says that she's also cashed Antonio 's check, and then she gives Antonio the money. She says, “Let me count out your  one hundred dollars.” “To count out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say the amo unt of money that you are giving someone. If you're giving someone a hundred dollars and you have five twenty-dollar bills, you would say, “20, 40, 60, 80 , 100.” That's exactly what the bank teller does with Antonio.

Antonio says, “Thanks. Could I also check my bank b alance for my other account?” Your “balance” (balance), when talking ab out money, or in this case a bank, is the amount of money that you still have in  your account – in this case, in your bank account. So, your bank balance would be h ow much money you have left in your account.

The bank teller says, “No problem.” Yes, of course.  “You just have to swipe your ATM card and enter your PIN.” You're “ATM card” sta nds for your Automatic Teller Machine card. That's the little card the ban k gives you that you can put into a machine and get money out of the machine so you d on't have to go to the bank or talk to a bank teller. That's why we call it an “automatic teller.” It's a machine teller.

“To swipe (swipe)” a credit card or a bank card mea ns to take the card and move it quickly through a narrow area that reads the ele ctronic information on the back

of the credit card, or the bank card. The teller is  telling Antonio to swipe his card, to move it quickly, so that the machine can read it .

After he swipes his ATM card, he’s supposed to ente r his PIN. “To enter” means, in this case to type, or put information into a com puter. The “PIN” (PIN) is the Personal Identification Number. Usually, it is four  digits, four numbers that you put in, that are associated with your ATM card. The  bank teller says, after Antonio does all of this, “It looks like you have a  balance of 1,752 dollars. Will that be all?” “Will that be all?” means “Can I help  you with something else? Are you finished?” Antonio says, “Oh, I have that much? ” He’s surprised at how much money he has. Then he says “I'd like to withdraw 80  dollars.” “To withdraw” (withdraw) means to take money out of an account. “ To deposit” is to put the money into the account. “To withdraw” is to take it  out of the account. That's what Antonio wants to do. He wants to withdraw $80.

The bank teller says, “All right.” Okay. “You need to fill out a withdrawal slip.” Just like the deposit slip is a small piece of paper whe n you deposit money into your bank account, a withdrawal slip is a piece of paper  you fill out with your information that you give to the bank teller so tha t he or she can take money out of your account. The teller says, “Why don't you st ep aside?” meaning “Why don't you step to one side of where I am standing while y ou do that,” while you fill out the withdrawal slip, “so that I can help the next c ustomer. And when you're done,” when you're finished, “come back to this window and  I'll help you.” The bank teller is telling Antonio that it's going to take a  little time for him to fill out his withdrawal slip so he should step away from the tel ler and let another customer come up and be helped by the teller. Then when Anto nio is ready, he can come back to the teller and give the teller his withdraw al slip.

The “window” here refers to the place where the tel ler is working in the bank. It usually isn’t a window at all, in the sense that it  looks out onto the outside of the building. It's in the inside of the building, and i t's just the place where the teller is working.

Antonio says, “Okay, I'll do that. And if I want to  transfer money between accounts?” “To transfer” (transfer) means to move y our money from one bank account to another. Antonio's asking what he needs to do if he wants to transfer money between accounts. The teller says, “You'll ne ed to fill out a withdrawal slip for the first amount and a deposit slip for the sec ond,” or the second amount. Antonio say “Got it,” meaning “Yes. I understand.” “This might take a while.”

“To take a while” (a while) means to last a long ti me, for something to need a lot of time in order to happen. It may take a while bef ore your English is perfect. It

will take a little time but if you keep working on it, it will happen. Antonio says that filling out all of these slips could “take a while. ” The bank teller says, “No problem, sir. We’re here all day, at least until fi ve o'clock.” The teller is saying that Antonio doesn't have to hurry because the bank  will be open at least until five o'clock in the afternoon.

Now let's listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Bank Teller:  Can I help you?

Antonio:  Yes, I’d like to deposit this check.

Bank Teller:  Please fill out a deposit slip and be  sure to endorse the check on the back.

# Driving Through a Speed Trap

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 886: Driving Through a Speed Trap.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 886. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Angel and Georgi na about driving too fast in your car and what happens when you do. Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialog]

Angel:  Why are you driving at a snail’s pace?

Georgina: This is an infamous speed trap.  I don’t want to get a ticket – again.

Angel:  I don’t see any squad cars along the road.  Are you sure this is the right stretch of road?

Georgina: I’m sure.  Those cops are crafty.  They h ide out behind big rocks or a bend in the road, and as soon as you let your guard  down and go over the speed limit, they nab you.

Angel:  But you’re not exceeding the speed limit.  In fact, you’re driving way under the speed limit.

Georgina: You can’t be too careful.  You never know  if those speed guns are accurate, and I don’t want there to be any doubt th at I’m being a law-abiding citizen.

Angel:  But at this pace, we could get home faster if we walked!

Georgina: Don’t exaggerate.  You might be able to r un home faster, but not walk.

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Angel saying to Georgina, “Why are you driving at snail’s pace?” This is an expression – “at a snail’ s pace.” It means very slowly. A “snail” (snail) is a small little animal that moves  very slowly when it moves across the ground. “Pace” (pace) here means speed. So, “at  a snail’s pace” means as fast as a snail, which means very, very slowly. Ang el is asking Georgina why she's driving so slowly.

Georgina says, “This is an infamous speed trap.” “I nfamous” (infamous) is an adjective meaning very famous for being bad or evil . “Infamous” is always a negative thing. If someone says, “He's infamous,” t hey mean that he's well known, everyone knows about him, but for the bad th ings that he's done. A “speed trap” is an area where the police typically look for cars that are driving too fast so that they can stop the driver and give him what's called a “ticket.” A “ticket” is not like a ticket to the movies or an a irline ticket. It's a piece of paper saying that you broke the law and that you have to pay money to the government because you broke the law.

So a speed trap is an area on a road or a highway o r anywhere that you drive, where the police know that people are often going t o drive fast in that one area. For example, here in Los Angeles, there is a speed trap right as you drive into the city of Beverly Hills, where all the rich peopl e live. There is an area on Santa Monica Boulevard that is a speed trap. I know becau se I've seen people there who have been stopped by the police. So, everyone d rives very slowly through that section because they know the police are waiti ng for them. The best way to find a speed trap, if you are new to an area or a c ity, is to drive really fast on all of the major or large streets and wait until you get s topped by the police, and then you will know where the speed trap this. (You're we lcome.)

Georgina is talking about an infamous, a well-known  speed trap. She says, “I don't want to get a ticket again.” Angel says, “I d on't see any squad cars along the road.” A “squad (squad) car” is another word for a police car, a car that police officers drive, usually around the neighborhood or part of the city in order to make sure there aren't any problems. You also have policemen and policewomen who drive motorcycles, but a squad car is a regular, four-door car. Angel says, “Are you sure that this is the right st retch of road?” “Stretch” (stretch) here means length of road or section of road – a pa rt of a road between this point and that point, between this place and that place. Stretch has a couple of other meanings as well. You can see those in our Learning  Guide.

Georgina says, “I'm sure.” I'm sure this is the rig ht or correct stretch of road. She says, “Those cops are crafty.” A “cop” (cop) is a s lang or informal word for a police officer – a man or woman who works for the p olice. “Crafty” (crafty) here

means clever or sneaky, someone who may use some di shonest ways of cheating you or trying to catch you.

Georgina thinks the police are crafty. She says, “T hey hide out behind the big rocks, or a bend in the road, and as soon as you le t your guard down and go over the speed limit, they nab you.” There are a co uple of expressions to explain here – first, “hide out.” “Hide (hide) out” is a tw o-word phrasal verb meaning to go somewhere where no one can see you. It's a verb, “t o hide out,” but it's also a noun, a “hideout” A “hideout” is a place  where you go so that no one will find you. Sometimes we use that noun to describe a place wher e criminals, people who have broken the law, go so that the police don't fi nd the. But it can also be used, for example, for a place where someone is hiding, s omeone is waiting for someone and they don't want to be seen. That's real ly the meaning here.

Georgina using the verb “to hide out” is talking ab out the police who don't want you to see them. They hide behind big rocks, or a b end in the road. A “bend” (bend) is a curve where the road turns a little eit her to the left or to the right. It doesn't continue going straight. That's a bend (ben d) in the road. We would also describe it, as I said, as a “curve” (curve). “To l et your guard (guard) down” means to relax, to not be worried, to not be cautio us, to not worry about what happens or how other people are reacting to you. Th at's to let your guard down. We might say that, for example, about a man or a wo man on a date. They're nervous about what the other person thinks of them so they don't want to let their guard down. They don't want to be normal, if you wi ll, they don't want to relax.

Georgina is saying that the police “Hide behind roc ks, or a bend in the road, and as soon as you let your guard down” – as soon as yo u relax – “and go over the speed limit,” meaning go too fast, go faster than y ou're supposed to – “they” – the police – “nab you.” “To nab (nab) someone” is to ca tch someone. Often, it means to arrest someone when the police come and take som eone away. They nab them. But it can also be used, for example, if some one is kidnapping another person, taking that person away and asking the fami ly to give them money in order to get the person back. We might use nab in t hat respect as well. But it's probably more commonly used in talking about the po lice.

Angel says, “But you're not exceeding the speed lim it.” “To exceed” (exceed) means to go beyond some limit. In this case, we’re talking about the speed limit – the maximum speed that you can drive on a road. Ang el says, “In fact, you're driving way under the speed limit.” The use of the word “way” here is as an adverb. It means very much or extremely. It's somew hat informal but it's very common in conversational English. People say, for e xample, “Oh, this is way  too difficult.” This is much too difficult. This is ver y difficult.

 Georgina says, “You can't be too careful,” meaning it's not possible to worry too much because you have to protect yourself. Georgina  says, “You never know if those speed guns are accurate.” A “speed gun” is no t a regular gun that you would kill someone with. A “speed gun” is also call ed a radar gun. It's a device that determines how fast a car is driving down the street. Georgina says, “I don't want there to be any doubt that I'm being a law-abi ding citizen.” A “law-abiding (abiding) citizen” is a responsible person who foll ows the laws, who obeys the rules.

Angel says, “But at this space,” – at this speed – “we could get home faster if we walked.” It would be faster to walk than to drive i n this car. That's what Angel is saying. Georgina says, “Don't exaggerate.” “To exag gerate,” (exaggerate) means to describe something as being bigger than it reall y is, or more serious than it really is, to try to make a situation more serious or more dramatic, perhaps, than it really has to be. So, if you say, for example, “ It's so hot outside. It's a million degrees out there,” well, of course, it's not actua lly a million degrees. You're exaggerating. You're using language that makes some thing seem bigger than it really is. Georgina says, “Don't exaggerate. You mi ght be able to run home faster but not walk.” So Georgina is sort of agreeing with  Angel. Yes, she's driving very slowly, but it would not be faster to walk home, al though it might be faster to run home.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed

[start of dialog]

Angel:  Why are you driving at a snail’s pace?

Georgina: This is an infamous speed trap.  I don’t want to get a ticket – again.

Angel:  I don’t see any squad cars along the road.  Are you sure this is the right stretch of road?

Georgina: I’m sure.  Those cops are crafty.  They h ide out behind big rocks or a bend in the road, and as soon as you let your guard  down and go over the speed limit, they nab you.

Angel:  But you’re not exceeding the speed limit.  In fact, you’re driving way under the speed limit.

Georgina: You can’t be too careful.  You never know  if those speed guns are accurate, and I don’t want there to be any doubt th at I’m being a law-abiding citizen.

Angel:  But at this pace, we could get home faster if we walked!

Georgina: Don’t exaggerate.  You might be able to r un home faster, but not walk.

# A Destructive Storm

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 887: A Destructive Storm.

This episode is a dialogue between Allen and Monica  about a dangerous storm, when you have very bad weather. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Allen:  Are you all right?

Monica:  Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard, especially this time of year.  Have you seen the news?

Allen:  I just watched it.  Overnight, the storm fe lled over 30 trees in and around the town and toppled utility lines.  City officials  are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restored until the we ekend.

Monica:  That’s terrible, especially with these uns easonably cold temperatures.  I heard the ferocious storm last night, but I didn’t expect that homes would actually be in danger of washing away.

Allen:  I don’t know if any will actually be washed  away unless we continue to get steady rain and snow, but those downed trees wrecke d plenty of homes.  It’ll take months for us to fully recover from this storm.

Monica:  They’re calling it “The Storm of the Centu ry.”

Allen:  Well, if we just get one of these storms th is century, then that’s more than enough!

[end of dialog]

Allen says to Monica, “Are you all right?” Are you okay? Monica says, “Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard,  especially this time of year.” Apparently Allen is talking to Monica on the teleph one. Monica says, “We’re fine.” We’re okay. “But that blizzard really caught us off  guard.” A “blizzard” (blizzard) is a very strong storm, with a lot of cold air and fas t-moving wind and most importantly a lot of snow. A blizzard is when it's snowing and the wind is blowing very hard, so you can't see as you walk outside bec ause there's so much snow. Monica said the blizzard really “caught us off guar d.” “To catch someone off guard” – “caught” is the past tense of “catch” – me ans for something to happen when a person is not expecting it and is completely  unprepared for it. I was caught off guard when my girlfriend told me that sh e was leaving me for another man. I was caught off guard. I was completely surpr ised. And isn't that the way it typically is? Right, guys?

Well, Monica was caught off guard by this blizzard.  She asks Allen if he’s seen the news – the newspapers or the news reports on te levision. Allen says, “I just watched it.” I just watched it on television. “Over night”- through the night or during the night – “the storm felled over thirty tr ees in and around town and toppled utility lines.” “To fell” (fell) means to m ake a tree fall down, usually by cutting the tree down, but if you have very strong winds, you could also have trees that fall down from the wind. Allen says the storm also toppled utility lines. “To topple” (topple) means to knock something over,  to knock something down.

A utility line is also called a power line. These a re long cables, long wires that carry electricity and Internet and telephone signal s and other electronic information from your house, or your building, to s ome other place. So, if you have electricity in your home or in your office, th ere must be some sort of line that connects the power from the city or the local power plant to your house. We would call that a utility line. Utility lines, at l east, traditionally in the United States, were always put up on very tall poles. Now, in many  places they bury the utility lines in the ground but traditionally and still in most places, in my neighborhood, for example, the utility lines are up on tall poles . That's the case in our story as well.

Allen says, “City officials are saying that some re sidents may not get their electricity restored until the weekend.” A “residen t” is someone who lives in a particular area. I'm a resident of Los Angeles. I'm  a resident of California. In the United States, the place where you are a resident, where you live permanently, is the place where you can vote, where you get your dr iver’s license, where you pay your taxes and so forth. “City officials,” acco rding to Allen, “are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restor ed until the weekend.” “To restore” (restore) means to bring something back th at perhaps has gone away, or

was damaged. We’re going to restore this old buildi ng. It's falling apart. It's not the way it used to be. We’re going to make it the w ay it used to be. We’re going to bring it back to the condition that it used to b e in. That's “to restore.” “To restore someone's electricity” would mean to give t hem back electricity that has been taken from them or that has not been delivered  to them in this case, because of the toppled utility lines.

Monica says, “That's terrible, especially with thes e unseasonably cold temperatures.” Something that is “unseasonably” is something that doesn't normally happen during this time of year. We’re ref erring specifically to the weather. We describe whether as unseasonable if, for example, it's in the middle of the summer time and it's very cold or if it's in  the middle of the winter and it's very hot. That would be unseasonable weather – weat her that doesn't normally happen during that time of year that season. There are, of course, four seasons – summer, fall, winter, spring – summer, fall, winter , spring.

Monica says, “I heard the ferocious storm last nigh t.” “Ferocious” (ferocious) is an adjective, typically used to describe someone who's  very angry and perhaps very dangerous with a lot of energy. Here it describes a  very strong storm, a storm that is causing a lot of damage. Monica says that s he didn't expect that homes would actually be in danger of “washing away.”

Okay, this is quite a storm. It probably is a storm  that has affected different parts of the country and so, it has different manifestati ons, different ways of showing itself, if you will. Monica describes the storm fir st as a blizzard. But then we also hear that utility lines were toppled, which could h appen in a blizzard with strong winds. Now, however, she's talking about homes bein g washed away. “To wash away” means to be removed from where they are by a strong force of water. A river, for example, if it gets too much water in it , could wash away the houses on either side of it. The force of the water could pus h the houses into the river. That would be “to wash away.” Usually the term “wash awa y” is used when talking about a “food” (flood). A flood is when you have to o much water in a river and in the case that I just described, that would be a flo od.

Here, Monica is talking about houses being washed a way, but of course that wouldn't be possible if it was a blizzard, unless s he's talking about the storm that first went through the southern part of the United States and then the northern part, or first, the northern part and then the sout hern part. That's possible. You could have rain in one area of the country and snow , where it’s colder, in another area of the country and that does sometimes happen.

Allen says, “I don't know if any will actually be w ashed away,” any homes, that is – “unless we continue to get steady rain and snow.”  “Steady” (steady) means consistent or constant, without any interruption, w ithout a pause – something that happens over a long period of time without stopping . That would be steady. Allen is talking about steady rain and snow. “But,” he sa ys, “those downed trees wrecked plenty of homes.” “To down a tree” is the s ame as “to fell a tree.” So, a “downed tree” is a fallen tree, a tree that has bee n knocked down either because it was cut down or because the wind blew it down. “ To wreck” (wreck) means to ruin, to destroy, to damage something. Allen is say ing that the trees fell on the houses and damaged the house.

This happened to me once. We had a bad storm, a lot  of wind and part of the tree in front of my house fell on my house and fort unately, there was no damage. It didn't wreck my house.

Allen says, “It'll take months for us to fully reco ver from this storm.” “To recover” means something similar to restore. It means to ret urn to the original condition after something has been damaged or injured. We oft en talk about recover when dealing with someone who's sick or ill. We hope the y will “recover.” We hope they will get better. Monica says, “They're calling it t he storm of the century.” This is a phrase that the newspapers and news programs on tel evision like to use – “storm of the century.” Whenever you have a big storm, if it's a really big storm, the newspapers will say “It's the storm of the century, ” meaning the most important or biggest storm in a hundred years. That is almost ce rtainly not true in most cases of course. There can only be one storm that was big ger than all the others, but every year or two, we hear this description of some thing being the storm of the century when usually it isn't.

You'll also hear people talk about the “crime of the century,” when someone is murdered or there's some serious or terrible crime.  Someone will call it “the crime of the century,” as if it were the worst crime in a  hundred years.

Allen says, “Well, if we just get one of these stor ms this century, then that's more than enough.” Something that is “more than enough” is something that is too much, more than what you want, or more than what yo u need.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed

[start of dialog]

Allen:  Are you all right?

Monica:  Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard, especially this time of year.  Have you seen the news?

Allen:  I just watched it.  Overnight, the storm fe lled over 30 trees in and around the town and toppled utility lines.  City officials  are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restored until the we ekend.

Monica:  That’s terrible, especially with these uns easonably cold temperatures.  I heard the ferocious storm last night, but I didn’t expect that homes would actually be in danger of washing away.

Allen:  I don’t know if any will actually be washed  away unless we continue to get steady rain and snow, but those downed trees wrecke d plenty of homes.  It’ll take months for us to fully recover from this storm.

Monica:  They’re calling it “The Storm of the Centu ry.”

Allen:  Well, if we just get one of these storms th is century, then that’s more than enough!

# Advertising in TV and Movies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 888: Advertising in TV and Movies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 888. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialog about advertising, or havi ng commercial advertisements in the world of television and movies. Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialog]

Victoria:  [clears her throat]  Congratulations are  in order.  I just scored a product placement for our brand in the latest McQuillanator  movie.  Thank you, thank you very much.

Gerard:  Really?  That’s great!  Will it have a pro minent place in the movie?

Victoria:  Well, you know how these things are.  Ou r logo goes by in the blink of an eye, but millions of people are going to see it.

Gerard:  So will the star be wearing our logo on hi s shirt or something?

Victoria:  Something like that.

Gerard:  But not that.

Victoria:  No, it’s a little more subtle than that,  but it’ll be embedded into an important scene.

Gerard:  But where are they going to see it?

Victoria:  Is that really important?  The important  thing is that our brand will be associated with a major Hollywood movie.  What more  could we ask for?

Gerard:  Stop beating around the bush.  Where in the movie will our logo appear?

Victoria:  All right.  It’ll be on the bottom of the star’s shoes, on the sole, and the audience will be able to see it when he’s running.

Gerard:  Only if he’s running in slow motion, but h e won’t be, right?  If it goes by that quickly, it’ll be more like subliminal adverti sing.

Victoria:  Exactly! I hadn’t thought of it that way , but hordes of people will be going out to buy our products and they won’t even k now why.  I’m even more of a genius than I thought!

[end of dialog]

Victoria begins by clearing her throat. “To clear y our throat” is to do this [clears throat)]. You are making a low sound, almost like a  cough, to get rid of anything that's in your throat that would prevent you from b eing heard clearly. I clear my throat before I record often.

Victoria begins by saying, “Congratulations are in order.” “To congratulate (congratulate) someone” means to say they've done a  good job, to give them your best wishes after they have accomplished somet hing. Someone who wins a race or wins a competition will be congratulated by  other people – “Good job!” “Congratulations!” “Congratulations are in order” i s a phrase used when you are talking to a group of people, typically, and you wa nt to congratulate one person. You want to announce some achievement or accomplish ment by this person, and tell him what a good job he did.

Victoria says, “I just scored a product placement f or our brand in the latest McQuillanator movie.” We learn immediately then tha t Victoria is congratulating herself or telling other people to congratulate her  because she's accomplished something. We don't normally ask other people to co ngratulate us, but Victoria does. This is Hollywood, after all.

She says “I just scored a product placement.” “To s core” here means to get or to obtain something that is very good. “I scored us tw o tickets to the Bruce Springsteen concert.” I was able to get, I was able  to buy, I was able to obtain, two tickets. “Product placement” is when a company' s product appears usually in a television show or a movie. So, if you're watchin g a TV show like “Friends” or “24,” and you see somebody drinking a can of Coca-C ola, or drinking from a can of Coca-Cola, that would be an example of product p lacement. Usually the company pays to have its product in the movie or in  the television program.

Victoria scored a product placement for our “brand, ” she says. A “brand” (brand) is a type of product or related products that are s old under a single name. Coca- Cola is a brand name. It's the name of a group of p roducts that are similar. Victoria scored a product placement for the company 's brand in the latest McQuillanator movie. (And if you haven't seen the l atest, the most recent, McQuillanator movie, I think you'll like it!) Victo ria says “Thank you. Thank you very much.” She sort of making a joke. She's congra tulating herself.

Gerard says, “Really? That’s great. Will it have a prominent place in the show?” “Prominent” means important or easily seen, easily noticed, so that people will see it easily. Victoria says, “Well, you know how t hese things are,” which means “you understand this kind of situation.” “Our logo goes by in the blink of an eye, but millions of people are going to see it.” A “log o” (logo) is a small image that represents the company. The expression “in the blin k of an eye” means very quickly, almost without noticing it.

Victoria said the logo goes by “in the blink of an eye, but millions of people will see it.” Gerard says, “So, will the star be wearing  our logo on his shirt or something?” He's asking if the main actor in this m ovie will be wearing something that has the logo of the company on his shirt. Vict oria says, “Something like that,” meaning “Well not exactly, but something similar to  that.” Gerard says “But not that ,” meaning not that exact thing I just said, wearin g the logo on his shirt. Victoria says, “No. It's a little more subtle than that.” “To be subtle” (subtle) means not obvious, not easily noticed, something th at is there but you may have to look for it.

Victoria says, “The logo will be embedded into an i mportant scene.” “To embed” (embed) means to put something inside of something else, almost to become part of it. The logo, then, will be embedded into a n important scene, an important part of the movie. Gerard says, “But where are they  going to see it?” Where are they going to see our logo, the thing that represen ts our company? Victoria says, “Is that really important? The important thing is t hat our brand will be associated with a major Hollywood movie.” “To be associated wi th” means to be connected to, to be related to. Their brand is going to be re lated or connected to a major, or very important, Hollywood movie. “What more could w e ask for?” That question means “What could be better than this situation?” T he idea of course, is nothing.

Gerard says, “Stop beating around the bush.” The ex pression “to beat (beat) around the bush (bush)” means to be very indirect i n describing something or telling someone about something. You're trying to a void saying exactly what you're talking about. “To beat around the bush” is always a bad thing. It's a negative way of describing what someone is doing in  talking to you.

 Gerard says, “Where in the movie will our logo appe ar?” In what part of the movie will we see our logo? Victoria replies, “All right. It will be on the bottom of the star’s shoes, on the sole, and the audience wil l be able to see it when he's running.” The bottom of your shoe is called the “so le (sole)” of your shoe. Of course, usually you can't see the bottom of someone 's shoes. Victoria says that the logo will be on the sole of the shoe and people  will see it when the star, the main character in the movie, is running with these shoes.

Gerard says, “Only if he's running in slow motion, but he won't be right?” “Slow motion” refers to playing a video recording at a sl ower speed so that it looks like the people are moving and talking very slowly – lik e our podcast English in slow motion. Gerard says, “But if it goes by that quickl y, it will be more like subliminal advertising.” “Subliminal (subliminal) advertising”  is advertising where the message only appears on the TV or movie screen very  quickly, for less than a second. The idea is that people see the image, the message, and their brain captures it but they're not aware that they saw tha t message. That's called subliminal advertising.

Victoria says, “Exactly. I hadn't thought of it tha t way,” – in that manner – “but hordes of people will be going out to buy our produ cts and they won't even know why.” Once again, the idea of subliminal advertisin g is that people get an idea, but they don't know where they saw it because they weren't consciously able to see the message or the image. Victoria is trying to  make the best of a not very good situation by saying that “Oh yes. Our advertis ing will work and hordes of people will be going out to buy our products.”

“Hordes” means a large group of people, many people . Hordes is a word that you need to pronounce carefully. You need to have the “ d” at the end of hordes otherwise you get the word “whores” which means som ething very different. It means a prostitute. And of course, you don't want t o be talking about prostitutes when you mean a large group of people.

“I'm even more of a genius than I thought,” Victori a says. A “genius” (genius) is a very smart or intelligent person, someone who is sm arter than the rest of us. In the twentieth century, we often talked about Einste in as being one of the geniuses of science. Victoria says that she is smar ter then she even realized because she has created this subliminal advertising  by putting the logo on the bottom of the star’s shoes.

Now let's listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Victoria:  [clears her throat]  Congratulations are  in order.  I just scored a product placement for our brand in the latest McQuillanator  movie.  Thank you, thank you very much.

Gerard:  Really?  That’s great!  Will it have a pro minent place in the movie?

# Taking Up a New Hobby

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 889: Taking up a New Hobby.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  889. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This dialogue we will discuss in this episode is ab out starting a new hobby, a new thing that you're going to do for fun and entertain ment. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Eric:  Who were you talking to on the phone?

Melissa:  My mother.  I was commiserating with her about Dad’s retirement.

Eric:  Your father retired two months ago.  That wa s a good thing, right?

Melissa:  Well, it’s good that he doesn’t have to w ork anymore, but he’s driving my mother up the wall.  He putters around the house  and gets in her way.  She retired last year, so she’s had a year to establish  her new routine.  He’s still kind of lost.

Eric:  Why doesn’t he take up a hobby?  That would give him something interesting to occupy his time.

Melissa:  Believe me, my mother has tried to intere st him in gardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has  worked.

Eric:  Those sound too sedentary for somebody as ac tive as your father. How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or g olf?

Melissa:  He wouldn’t be interested in those hobbie s.  I think he needs something more challenging, maybe playing chess or doing gene alogy.  Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.

Eric:  Maybe your Dad just needs time to find his f ooting again.  Given time, he’ll figure out what he wants to do with his newfound fr ee time.

Melissa:  Maybe.  But what does my mother do in the  meantime?

Eric:  She can take up a new hobby, too – out of the house!

[end of dialog]

Eric starts off by saying, “Who were you talking to  on the phone?” Melissa says, “My mother. I was commiserating with her about dad' s retirement.” “To commiserate” (commiserate) means to spend time talk ing with someone about his or her experience of sadness or problems. It's to give someone sympathy, to say, “Oh, yes, I understand. Boy, that's really dif ficult.” You are commiserating with them. Melissa was commiserating with her mothe r about her father's retirement. “Retirement” is the period of time, usu ally when you're older when you stop working full-time and, we hope, relax a little .

Eric says, “Your father retired two months ago. Tha t was a good thing, right?” Melissa says, “Well, it's good that he doesn't have  to work anymore, but he's driving my mother up the wall.” “To drive someone u p the wall” means to make them go crazy, to drive them crazy. Usually, we ref er to people who are very annoying, or who cause you to get angry or upset, w e may say those people are “driving you up the wall.” Melissa's father is driv ing her mother up the wall. Why? She says that her father “putters around” the house  and gets in her way. “To putter (putter) around” means to spend time doing t hings that aren't very important, especially when you're bored and you’re looking for something to do. Maybe you'll go and you'll clean your desk, or you' ll go outside and try to cut your grass a little bit here and there, but not really s eriously, not with any sort of purpose. You're basically wasting time. You're putt ering around.

Well, Melissa's father is puttering around the hous e and getting in the way of his wife. Melissa says that her mother retired last yea r so she's had a year to establish a new routine. “To establish a routine” m eans to get into the habit of doing certain things. When you retire, and you don' t have to go to work every day, you have to develop a new routine, a new set o f habits that you will follow when you get up in the morning and through the rest  of the day.

Melissa says that her father is still “kind of” los t, meaning he’s somewhat lost. Eric says, “Why doesn't he take up a hobby?” “To ta ke up” is a two-word phrasal verb which here means to begin doing some activity for the first time. Usually, we use this phrasal verb when we are starting some new  activity for fun. An activity

that you do for fun for enjoyment, for pleasure is often called a “hobby” (hobby). A hobby could be something like golfing. A hobby co uld be collecting stamps, postage stamps. A hobby could be playing cards, pla ying cards with your friends every Tuesday. That might be something that is part  of your hobby. “To take up a hobby” means to start a new hobby.

Eric said that taking up a hobby would give him som ething interesting “to occupy his time.” “To occupy your time” means to keep your self busy, to keep yourself doing something so you don't get bored. Melissa say s, “Believe me,” meaning trust me, “my mother has tried to interest him in g ardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has worked.” These a re three hobbies you could take up. The first is “gardening,” where you grow p lants in a certain area, grow flowers or vegetables or something else. “Woodworki ng” refers to building things out of wood. We might also call it, if it were an o ccupation, “carpentry.” To make things out of wood is “woodworking.” “Scrapbooking”  is creating informal books with photographs and other things to help you remem ber usually a certain time in your life or certain important events in your life.  That's called “scrapbooking” (scrapbooking).

Eric says that these hobbies that Melissa's mother has tried to interest her father in sound too “sedentary” for somebody as active as her father. He is talking about activities being “sedentary” (sedentary). Tha t means to be without a lot of physical activity, not very active just sitting in a chair on a couch. Eric says, “How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or g olf?”

“Bird watching” is a hobby where people go and look  at birds try to identify different kinds of birds that are out in the world.  “Golf” is a game that you play with a small white ball and metal or wooden sticks,  which are called “clubs.” You try to get the ball into a little round hole. Famou s golfers would include people like Tiger Woods. That's the game he plays, golf.

Melissa says, “He wouldn’t be interested in those h obbies. I think he needs something more challenging” – more difficult – “may be playing chess or doing genealogy.” “Chess” (chess) is a game that you play  on a board where you have two players – one player tries to move the chess pi eces around in order to defeat the other player. The board usually has white and b lack squares and each side of the board has these little pieces that you move aro und and try to capture the other person's pieces. That's chess. “Genealogy” (g enealogy) is when you study your ancestors, when you figure out who your grandf ather, your great- grandfather, your great-great-grandfather, your gre at-great-great grandfather, were. You try to figure out who all those people we re.

Melissa says, “Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.” A musical instrument would be something like a guitar  or a piano or a violin. Those are all musical instruments, things that we use to make music. Eric says, “Maybe your dad just needs to find his footing again.” “To  find your footing” (footing) means simply to know what you want, to feel comfort able in a certain situation. Sometimes, it takes a while when people retire to a djust, to change their life, to change their thinking so that they are comfortable in the new situation.

Eric says, “Given time” – if he has enough time – “ he'll figure out” – he'll discover – “what he wants to do with his newfound free time. ” “Newfound” – one word – means recently obtained, something you just got. We  often use that in describing freedom, or free time – my newfound freedom. I just  ended a relationship with my girlfriend. I have newfound freedom! Of course, you  also don't have a girlfriend, but the idea is that it’s something positive. My ne wfound free time, free time that I didn't have just a few days ago or weeks ago and no w I have.

Melissa says, “Maybe, but what does my mother do in  the meantime?” – until that happens. Eric says, “She can take up a new hobby to o – out of the house,” meaning until Melissa's father finds a new hobby, a  new routine, Melissa's mother should take up a new hobby that would requir e her to leave the house so she wasn't in the house with her husband.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Eric:  Who were you talking to on the phone?

Melissa:  My mother.  I was commiserating with her about Dad’s retirement.

Eric:  Your father retired two months ago.  That wa s a good thing, right?

Melissa:  Well, it’s good that he doesn’t have to w ork anymore, but he’s driving my mother up the wall.  He putters around the house  and gets in her way.  She retired last year, so she’s had a year to establish  her new routine.  He’s still kind of lost.

Eric:  Why doesn’t he take up a hobby?  That would give him something interesting to occupy his time.

Melissa:  Believe me, my mother has tried to intere st him in gardening, woodworking, and even scrapbooking, but nothing has  worked.

 Eric:  Those sound too sedentary for somebody as ac tive as your father. How about encouraging him to take up bird watching or g olf?

Melissa:  He wouldn’t be interested in those hobbie s.  I think he needs something more challenging, maybe playing chess or doing gene alogy.  Maybe he could even learn to play a musical instrument.

Eric:  Maybe your Dad just needs time to find his f ooting again.  Given time, he’ll figure out what he wants to do with his newfound fr ee time.

Melissa:  Maybe.  But what does my mother do in the  meantime?

Eric:  She can take up a new hobby, too – out of the house!

We hope it's a long time before our scriptwriter go es into retirement. That's because we love the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Enjoying Nature

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 890, Enjoying Nature. This is English as a Second Language Podcas t episode 890. I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan coming to you from the Cent er for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there and become a me mber of ESL podcast and download a Learning Guide.

This episode is a dialogue between Charles and Rach el about going out and enjoying the world outside of your home, outside of  any building, enjoying nature. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Charles:  This is what I call the great outdoors.  Look at that stunning view!

Rachel:  This is truly jaw-dropping.  We’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world where wildlife lives in  its natural habitat.

Charles: It’s almost like living in the middle of t he wilderness, isn’t it? I bet those ponds and forests have amazing biodiversity.

Rachel:  It is beautiful, and it’s great to be away  from all of the pollution of the city.  I’ve never seen foliage like this.  This is truly a majestic landscape.

Charles:  You really can’t appreciate the outdoors until you come to a place like this.

Rachel:  You’re right.  I feel like I’m at one with  nature here.

Charles:  Should we leave the hotel and go for a wa lk?

Rachel:  A walk?  Why?  We have the best view of na ture right here.  We don’t want to spoil the effect by getting too close.

[end of dialog]

Charles begins our dialogue by saying to Rachel, “T his is what I call the great outdoors.” The phrase “the great outdoors” refers t o the beauty of the natural world – mountains, and rivers, and flowers – and ev erything that's natural out in

the world that you can go see – the ocean, trees, f orests – all of these things are part of what you could call “the great outdoors,” m eaning the wonderful world of nature. Charles says, “Look at that stunning view.”  “Stunning” (stunning) means very impressive, very beautiful. A “view” refers to  the things you can see when you look in a certain direction. Some people who li ve near the ocean have a view of the ocean. They can look out of their window and  see the ocean. Charles is talking about a stunning, or amazingly beautiful vi ew.

Rachel agrees. She says, “This is truly jaw-droppin g.” The term “jaw-dropping,” used as an adjective here, means very surprising, v ery shocking but in a good way – something that is really good, really beautif ul. Your “jaw” (jaw) is the lower part of your face. It's what you move up and down w hen you talk, and when you eat your food. That whole thing is called your jaw.  “To drop” means to go down quickly. “Jaw-dropping” would be when your jaw drop s down and your mouth is open. That's the expression that we have on our fac e when we see something very surprising or very amazing. That's why we have  this term “jaw-dropping” to describe something that is amazing. Rachel says, “W e’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world.” “Pristine” ( pristine) means perfect, just like new – something that hasn't been touched, something  that hasn't been altered or changed in any way.

Rachel says they’re in one of the most pristine are as of the world where wildlife lives in its natural habitat. “Wildlife” (wildlife)  – one word – refers normally to the animals that live in nature, not your dog or your c at in your house, but bears and moose and, I don't know, wolves, that live out away  from any human area, away from any area where the humans live. That would be wildlife. “Wildlife” is any animal that doesn't live inside of a house or insid e of a cage. Rachel says this is an area where wildlife lives in its natural habitat . The “natural habitat” (habitat) is the area where a certain kind of animal normally li ves or a certain kind of plant normally grows. This again would be, typically, an area where there aren't any humans or very few humans, and so the animals and t he plants live and die as they would normally do, without any humans interfer ing, or any humans getting involved.

Charles says, “It's almost like living in the middl e of the wilderness, isn't it?” “Wilderness” (wilderness) is a large area of land t hat doesn't have a lot of humans in it. It doesn't have a lot of buildings or  a lot of roads. That would be “wilderness.” Large parts of the state of Alaska he re in the United States could be described as wilderness. They’re areas where no hum ans have ever even gone or at least that we know of. Charles says, “This is  like living in the middle of the wilderness.” He says, “I bet those ponds and forest s have amazing biodiversity.” A “pond” (pond) is a small lake. “Forests” are area s where there are a lot of trees.

“Biodiversity” refers to the variety, the different  kinds of life in a certain area. It might be different kinds of plants. It might be dif ferent kinds of animals. Typically it's both of those things. That's what “biodiversit y” refers to. “To be diverse” means to be different, to have a lot of different t ypes. “Biodiversity,” then refers to a lot of different types of life.

Rachel says, “It is beautiful and it's great to be away from all of the pollution of the city.” “Pollution” (pollution) refers to someth ing that is dirty, something that is harmful perhaps even something that is poisonous. W hen we talk about pollution here in Los Angeles, we're usually referring to air  pollution, where you look in a distance towards downtown and you see this sort of brown air. That would be pollution. We have a lot of it here in Los Angeles.  It's the part of the city that isn't so beautiful. Rachel then says, “I've never seen fo liage like this.” “Foliage” (foliage) are the leaves of trees and other plants.  That's foliage. “This is truly a majestic landscape.” “Majestic” (majestic) refers t o something that is very beautiful, very lovely, very impressive. “Landscape ” is the same as scenery. It's the things that you can see in a distance, usually when there aren't a lot of buildings or houses that are blocking your view. Yo u can see out onto the land. That would be the “landscape.” Charles says, “You c an't really appreciate” – you can't really understand and enjoy – “the outdoors u ntil you come to a place like this.” Rachel says, “You're right. I feel like I'm at one with nature.” “To be at one with something” means that you feel connected to it . You feel united with that thing or that idea or that group of people, even. I n this case, Rachel feels at one with nature – with the natural environment, the nat ural world. Charles says, “Should we leave the hotel and go for a walk?” That , of course, is the funny part of the dialog. We imagine, in the first part of the  dialogue that they're out somewhere by a lake, or in the mountains, or in a f orest but instead they're still in their hotel. Charles says, “Should we leave the hot el and go for a walk?” Rachel says, “A walk? Why? We have the best view of nature  right here. We don't want to spoil the effect by getting too close.” “To spoi l (spoil) the effect (effect)” means to change or to ruin some perception or illusion th at you have, to change the way you are thinking about something in such a way that  it would be worse, that it would be not as good. That would be “to spoil the e ffect.”

Rachel says, “We don't want to spoil the effect” – the effect of this beautiful nature – “by getting too close” – by actually leavi ng their hotel and going out into the nature that they are looking at through their w indow. That’s kind of my view of enjoying nature. I like to enjoy nature from my hot el room, from my car maybe. An airplane would also be a place I could enjoy nat ure from. I’m not so much interested in going out into the actual nature itse lf. Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed

[start of dialog]

Charles:  This is what I call the great outdoors.  Look at that stunning view!

Rachel:  This is truly jaw-dropping.  We’re in the middle of one of the most pristine areas of the world where wildlife lives in  its natural habitat.

Charles: It’s almost like living in the middle of t he wilderness, isn’t it? I bet those ponds and forests have amazing biodiversity.

Rachel:  It is beautiful, and it’s great to be away  from all of the pollution of the city.  I’ve never seen foliage like this.  This is truly a majestic landscape.

Charles:  You really can’t appreciate the outdoors until you come to a place like this.

Rachel:  You’re right.  I feel like I’m at one with  nature here.

Charles:  Should we leave the hotel and go for a wa lk?

Rachel:  A walk?  Why?  We have the best view of na ture right here.  We don’t want to spoil the effect by getting too close.

She's at one with the English language. Her scripts  are majestic. They’re stunning. I speak of course, of our very own, Dr. L ucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.



# Checking on the Status of an Application

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 891: Checking on the Status of an Application.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 891. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Why go there? Well, so y ou can become a member of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is about someone who is waiting to hea r some news about an application that she sent to an organization to bec ome a member of some program. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Leo:  Here’s the mail.

Denise:  Did I get anything?

Leo:  No, sorry.  Are you expecting something?

Denise:  Yeah, I’m waiting for a decision letter ab out my application to the McQ program.  I should hear any day now.

Leo:  Have you thought about calling and checking o n the status?

Denise:  I called last week and my application was still under review. I was told that a decision was still pending.

Leo:  I’m sure it was just awaiting approval.  Ther e is no chance it’ll be rejected. You’re an ideal candidate and you’re sure to get go od news in a day or two.

Denise:  I hope you’re right.  In the meantime, I’m  on pins and needles.  Every time the mail carrier walks by, my heart skips a be at.

Leo:  I know this is important to you, but you’ve g ot to keep it in perspective.  It’s not a life-or-death situation.

Denise:  I am keeping it in perspective.  If I don’ t get into this program, it’s only the end of my career, my dream, and my future – tha t’s all!

[end of dialog]

Leo says to Denise, “Here's the mail.” Here are the  letters and packages we received from the post office. Denise says, “Did I get anything?” Did anything arrive or come for me? Leo says “No, sorry. Are you  expecting something?” Are you waiting for something? Denise says, “Yeah,” mea ning yes. “I'm waiting for a decision letter about my application to the McQ pro gram.” A “decision letter” would be a letter saying whether you were accepted into the program or not. It might be a letter saying whether you were accepted into a university or a college as a student or not. A “decision letter” could be a bout applying for a job and telling you whether you got the job or not. This is  a case where Denise is applying for some program. We’re not exactly sure w hat the program is – McQ program. So, it’s probably a good program with that  kind of name. Denise says she's waiting for a decision letter about her appli cation. “Application” is when you submit or you send in certain documents, certain pi eces of paper that have information about you and why you want to, in this case, be part of this program.

Denise says, “I should hear any day now.” “To hear”  (hear) in this case, means to receive a response, to receive an answer. We might also say “to hear back.” “Have you heard back from your sister?” You might s ay, “No, I wrote her a letter last week,” or “I sent her an e-mail,” more likely.  “But she hasn't responded to me. I haven’t heard back.” Denise says, “I should h ear,” meaning I should get a decision any day now. “Any day now” means very soon , in the very near future. We’re not sure exactly when, but it will be in a ve ry brief amount of time – “any day now.” Leo says, “Have you thought about calling  and checking on the status?” “To check on something” means to investiga te it, to make sure it's okay. “Status” (status) refers to the condition of someth ing, the situation that something is in. So, to call and check on the status would be  to call the organization and ask about your application. Were you accepted? Were you  rejected? – and so forth.

Denise in fact did call. She said, “I called last w eek and my application was still under review.” “To be under review” means it's bein g considered. They’re thinking about it. They’re looking at it carefully.  It's under review. “Under review” is normally used for some sort of official process,  some sort of official consideration by a(n) organization, or by someone i mportant. Denise was told that a decision – a decision about whether she will  be accepted into the program or not – was still “pending.” Something that is “pe nding” (pending) is something you haven't decided yet. You're waiting for a final  answer. It's still pending. You don't know if it's yes or no. Leo says, “I'm sure i t was just awaiting approval.”

“Approval” is when you say “yes” to something. “Awa iting” means that it is waiting for. In this case, “awaiting approval” means that i t's going to be approved. Really, they've already decided that. They just haven't gon e through the formal process of approving it. That's the implication that Leo is  trying to give here. Leo says, “There is no chance” – it is not even possible – “i t will be rejected” – it will be denied. They will say “no.” Leo is saying, “That’s not even possible.” “You're the ideal candidate and you're sure to get good news in  a day or two.” “Ideal” (ideal) in this case means perfect, the best. “Candidate” r efers to someone who is trying to get into a program or get into a job. You could have a “job candidate.” You could have a “program candidate” – someone trying t o get into a program. You can also have a candidate for public office. We hav e presidential candidates every four years here in the United States – two me n or two women, or a man and a woman. It's always been two men up to this po int, who want to be president. They are candidates for the presidency. They are candidates for that political office.

Denise is not a political candidate. She's a candid ate for this program. She's trying to get into the program. Leo says she's an i deal candidate and she is sure to get good news soon. “Sure to” means it will happ en. It will definitely happen. There's no doubt about it. Denise says, “I hope you 're right” – I hope you are correct. “In the meantime,” or until I find out, “I 'm on pins and needles.” The expression “to be on pins (pins) and needles (needl es) means to be very nervous, to be worried about something. “I'm on pin s and needles waiting to see whether my girlfriend will say ‘yes’ – “yes,” of co urse, to marrying me. That’s just an example. I'm already married. So, I don't have a  girlfriend but before I was married, I had a girlfriend and I asked her to marr y me, not just marry but marry me, and after I asked her, I was waiting for her an swer. I was on pins and needles. She said “yes,” of course. That's why she' s my wife.

Anyway, back to our story. Denise says that she's o n pins and needles waiting for a decision about whether she will be accepted i nto the McQ program. She says, “Every time the mail carrier walks by, my hea rt skips a beat.” A “mail carrier” is the person who brings the letters to yo ur house or to your office every day. We used to call them “mailmen” because they we re all men, but now there are women who also carry mail and some people didn' t like the term “mailmen,” so they changed it to “mail carrier.” A “carrier” i s anyone who carries something, who brings something from one place to another. Den ise says that when the mail carrier walks by, when he or she comes to her house , her heart skips a beat. To say that your heart “skips a beat” means that you a re very excited. You are waiting for something to happen. That's the express ion – “my heart skips a beat.” I'm very excited. I can't wait. I'm almost, almost sick with anticipation. Leo says, “I know this is important to you,” but you've got to k eep it in perspective. “To keep

something in perspective” means to be realistic, to  be calm, to be rational, not to get too excited about it.

Leo says, “It's not a life-or-death situation.” A “ life-or-death situation” would be a situation where you are either going to live or die , where you could die if something goes wrong. Leo is saying here that getti ng into this program is not a life or death situation. You won't die if you don't  get into it. Denise says, “I am keeping it in perspective. If I don't get into this  program, it's only the end of my career, my dream, and my future. That's all.” Denis e is making a joke here. She’s saying, “Oh, yes. I'm not getting too excited but,”  she says, “if I don't get into this program, it will be the end of my career,” the end of my work life. It will be the end of my dream and it will be the end of my future. So , of course, she really has not kept it in perspective. She thinks it is a life-or- death situation, a very serious situation if she doesn't get into the McQ program. Well Denise, I wish you luck. Not everyone can get into the McQ program.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Leo:  Here’s the mail.

Denise:  Did I get anything?

Leo:  No, sorry.  Are you expecting something?

Denise:  Yeah, I’m waiting for a decision letter ab out my application to the McQ program.  I should hear any day now.

Leo:  Have you thought about calling and checking o n the status?

Denise:  I called last week and my application was still under review. I was told that a decision was still pending.

Leo:  I’m sure it was just awaiting approval.  Ther e is no chance it’ll be rejected. You’re an ideal candidate and you’re sure to get go od news in a day or two.

Denise:  I hope you’re right.  In the meantime, I’m  on pins and needles.  Every time the mail carrier walks by, my heart skips a be at.

Leo:  I know this is important to you, but you’ve g ot to keep it in perspective.  It’s not a life-or-death situation.

 Denise:  I am keeping it in perspective.  If I don’ t get into this program, it’s only the end of my career, my dream, and my future – tha t’s all!

# Preparing for the Busy Season

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 892: Preparing for a Busy Season.   This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 892. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.   Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there today and become a Learning Guide member, where you’ll be able to, well, download the Learning Guide.   This episode is a dialogue between Yuko and Reza about getting ready for being busy at your work or whatever activity you do. Let’s get started.  [start of dialog]  Yuko:  What’s all this?  Reza:  We’re gearing up for the busy season.  We don’t want to get caught with our pants down like we did last season.  Yuko:  Last season, we had a unusual number of visitors because of the unseasonably warm weather.  We can’t expect lightening to strike twice.  Reza:  We have to prepare for every contingency.  If we get a flood of visitors, we need to be able to handle the surge in traffic.  These three months are our peak months anyway, so we should expect an upswing in business soon.  Yuko:  But what if people don’t come in large numbers as you’re anticipating?  All of these extra supplies will go to waste.  Reza:  No, they won’t.  Most of this stuff isn’t perishable, so we’ll just save it for the next time we get a rush of visitors.  Or, maybe, I’ll just invite my buddies over at the end of the season and we’ll have a party.  Yuko:  So when you said that we have to plan for every contingency, this was what you meant.  Reza:  Exactly!  [end of dialog] # Sports-Related Injuries

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 893: Sports- Related Injuries.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 893. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast by going to our website. This episode is a dialogue between Grace a nd Paul, about getting hurt, getting physically injured, while playing sports. L et’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Grace:  What happened to you?!

Paul:  I had a little accident at the game today.

Grace:  Little accident?!  You’re limping and obvio usly in pain!

Paul:  I just pulled a muscle in my back and aggrav ated my runner’s knee, that’s all.  It’s nothing to worry about.

Grace:  And you’re still recovering from the sprain ed ankle, concussion, and neck strain from three weeks ago.  Don’t you think you s hould sit out of the game for the next few weeks?

Paul:  I might have to, but these aren’t serious in juries.  They’re just part of playing sports.

Grace:  I hate to bring this up again, but you’re n ot 20-years-old anymore. Maybe your ligaments, tendons, and joints aren’t wh at they used to be.

Paul:  Don’t start with me.  I’m in the prime of my  life and in perfect physical condition.  Don’t try to tell me I’m over the hill just because I get an injury or two now and then.

Grace:  I’m not saying you’re over the hill.  I jus t worry that you can’t sit, stand, or lay down comfortably.

Paul:  Who says I can’t...ow!

 [end of dialog]

Grace begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “What happened to you?” That's a question we would ask, especially in that excited o r shocked tone of voice, in that surprised way, when you see something that you don' t expect, something is wrong with the other person. Grace says, “What happ ened to you?” And Paul says, “I had a little accident at the game today.” An “accident” is usually something that goes wrong. It could be you did some thing wrong and you hurt yourself, or it could be someone hit you and you go t hurt. Paul had a “little” accident. Grace says, “Little accident? You’re limp ing and obviously in pain.” Grace says this is no little accident. It's not a s mall or minor accident because Paul is limping. “To limp” (limp) means to walk wit h difficulty, not to walk normally. When you hurt your leg, for example, you usually will limp. You will walk in a funny way, in a strange way.

Paul says, “I just pulled a muscle in my back.” “To  pull a muscle” means to put too much force on a muscle, to strain it, to stretc h it in such a way that you hurt it. Paul says he pulled a muscle in his back and aggrav ated his “runner’s knee.” “To aggravate” (aggravate) means to make something wors e, typically something that is already bad. You do something to make somet hing that's already bad, even worse.

Paul had a bad knee. He had what is called sometime s “runner’s knee.” Your knee is that part of your body in the middle of you r leg that connects the top of your leg to the bottom of your leg. “Runner's knee”  is an injury that your knee can have, especially if you do a lot of running. You mi ght hurt it by running. That's why I never run. Never run! If you never run, you'l l never hurt your knee. That's my philosophy. So I never run.

Anyway, Paul, not as smart as I am, obviously, was a runner and he hurt his knee. By playing in the game yesterday, or I guess it was today, Paul aggravated his runner’s knee. He made it worse. Paul says, “It 's nothing to worry about.” You don't have to be concerned. Grace says, “And you're  still recovering from the sprained ankle, concussion, and neck strain from th ree weeks ago.” Grace says, “Wait a minute, you already had all of these other problems that were caused by playing in your sports game three weeks ago.” What are these problems?

The first is a sprained ankle. Your “ankle” (ankle)  is the part that connects your leg to your foot. “To sprain” (sprain) means to inj ure, to hurt. A sprained ankle, then, is when someone hurts their foot or that part  of their foot, usually, the muscles or some other part of the body that is arou nd the ankle.

 A “concussion” (concussion) is a temporary period, a short time, when you are unconscious, when you are not aware of what is happ ening to you. Why does this happen? Well, because usually you are hit, hit  in the head. If you get hit in the head hard, you might lose consciousness. It's a lmost like falling asleep. It can however, be a very serious problem. You might have damaged or hurt something when you were hit in the head. That would be to hav e a concussion. It happens a lot in certain sports where the players get hit in the head. That's why you should never  play sports where you get hit in the head. Just a little advice from me to you.

Grace talks about Paul's injuries and includes a “n eck strain” in her list. A “neck strain” is when you hurt a muscle in your neck. Thi s can happen if you are sitting at your computer all day and you keep putting your head in a certain position. You could eventually get neck strain. You could hur t your neck. This is why I always advise people, “ Never  sit in front of a computer!” Grace continues by saying, “Don't you think you should sit out of the game for the next few weeks?” “To sit out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning not  to participate in something, not to be involved in something, usually a game of some sort. “I'm going to sit out this evening of baseball.” I'm not going to play. I 'm going to sit it out, I'm not going to participate. Paul says, “I might have to,” meani ng I might have to sit out the next game, “but these aren't serious injuries.” An “injury” (injury) is when you hurt part of your body.

Paul says these are not serious injuries. They're j ust part of playing sports. Grace says, “I hate to bring this up again,” I hate to me ntion this again, “but you're not a twenty-year-old anymore.” You're not twenty years o ld and you don't have a body that will be able to do the kinds of physical activ ities that you have been doing. That's what Grace is saying. She says, “Maybe your ligaments, tendons and joints aren't what they used to be,” meaning these parts of your body are not as strong as they were when you were younger. What par ts of the body?

Well, she begins with “ligaments.” “Ligaments” (lig aments) are things in your body that connect bones or bones and other what are  called “tissues” – other substances in your body. A “tendon” (tendon) is som ething in your body that connects a muscle to a bone. So tendons connect mus cles to bones. The most famous tendon you have is called your “Achilles ten don.” That's the tendon that connects your lower leg muscle to your foot. The th ird thing that Grace mentions is “joints.” A “joint” (joint) is when two parts of  the body come together, for example, the top of your arm and the bottom of your  arm – your upper arm and lower arm are connected together at your elbow. Tha t's an example of a joint. So we have ligaments, tendons, and joints.

 Paul says, “Don't start with me.” This is an expres sion that means you don't want to hear what the other person is saying because the y’ve said it to you before over and over again, many times. “Don't start with me,” meaning, “Don't start criticizing me the way you usually do.” It's something that a h usband might say to a wife, for example – just an example, not me!

Paul says, “I'm in the prime of my life.” The “prim e (prime) of your life” are the best years of your life. Some people consider their  younger years to be the prime of their life. Other people consider their middle y ears to be the prime of their life. Some people consider their older years as the prime  of their life. I think of whatever age I am right now as the prime of my life . Paul says, “Don't try to tell me I'm over the hill.” “To be over the hill” means to be old, to be too old, to be more than halfway through your life. So, if you exp ect to live until you're 80, once you become 40, you are over the hill. I think I'm o ver the hill right now. I think I'm, I'm beyond the halfway point in my life, maybe.

Paul says, “Don't try to tell me, Grace, I'm over t he hill, just because I get an injury or two now and then” – every once in a while . Grace says, “I'm not saying you're over the hill. I just worry that you can't s it, stand, or lie down comfortably.” Paul says, “Who says I can't?” This is an expressio n you use when you are trying to tell the other person they’re wrong. Paul says, “Who says I can't?” And then he says, “Ow,” meaning he obviously can't sit, stand, or lie down without being in pain.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Grace:  What happened to you?!

Paul:  I had a little accident at the game today.

Grace:  Little accident?!  You’re limping and obvio usly in pain!

Paul:  I just pulled a muscle in my back and aggrav ated my runner’s knee, that’s all.  It’s nothing to worry about.

Grace:  And you’re still recovering from the sprain ed ankle, concussion, and neck strain from three weeks ago.  Don’t you think you s hould sit out of the game for the next few weeks?

Paul:  I might have to, but these aren’t serious in juries.  They’re just part of playing sports.

Grace:  I hate to bring this up again, but you’re n ot 20-years-old anymore. Maybe your ligaments, tendons, and joints aren’t wh at they used to be.

Paul:  Don’t start with me.  I’m in the prime of my  life and in perfect physical condition.  Don’t try to tell me I’m over the hill just because I get an injury or two now and then.

Grace:  I’m not saying you’re over the hill.  I jus t worry that you can’t sit, stand, or lay down comfortably.

Paul:  Who says I can’t...ow!

# Understanding Modern Art

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 894: Understanding Modern Art.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 894. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful, and I do mean beautiful, Los Angeles, Ca lifornia.

We have a website. Yes, we do. We have a website. H ow about you? Well, our website is ESLPod.com and if you go there, you can become a member of ESL Podcast and download the Learning Guide for this ep isode.

This episode is about understanding modern art, som ething many of us have a difficult time doing. We’ll listen to a dialogue be tween Stephan and Livia. Let's get started.

 > Stephan: What’s that?
> Livia: It’s my latest artwork. It’s experimental.
> Stephan: It’s, um...
> Livia: Abstract. It’s part of a performance art pie ce I’m putting together. It’ll really challenge people’s perceptions of reality.
> Stephan: I don’t really understand contemporary art . Is it supposed to represent something?
> Livia: It’s my interpretation of how the rich oppre ss the poor.
> Stephan: Really?
> Livia: Yes, from a postmodern perspective.
> Stephan: Oh, I see.
> Livia: You do?
> Stephan begins our dialogue by asking Livia, “What' s that?” What is that? Livia says, “It's my latest artwork. It's experimental.” “Artwork” (artwork) – one word - is anything that an artist creates that expresses his or her ideas. It could be a painting. It could be a sculpture. It could be draw ing. It could be film. Any of these objects, any of these things, could be called artwo rk. Livia says that her artwork is experimental. “Experimental” usually means somet hing that is new, something that hasn't been done before, something that perhap s you're not quite sure will work.

Stephan says, “It's um...” He uses “um” to think of  something to say. Of course, he wants to say something nice but he's a little pe rhaps confused. Livia says “abstract.” She’s describing what the artwork is. S tephan couldn't come up with the name perhaps. So, Livia helps him by saying it' s abstract art. “Abstract” means, as imaginative – when we’re talking about ar t – objects that don't look like real objects. They’re are not clearly seen. Yo u have to use perhaps your imagination to understand what the symbols or shape s or colors are saying to you in the art.

Livia says, “It's part of a performance art piece I 'm putting together.” “Performance art” is really a kind of drama, kind o f acting, a kind of series of actions that make up the art piece. Performance art  typically happens in a given place and time, and if you're not there, then you c an't experience the art. It's not like art on the wall at a museum. I actually took a  class in performance art, oh, many years ago, back in the early 90’s. Performance  art was very popular in Los Angeles. There were a lot of well-known artists who  came to Los Angeles to do performance art and there are still places where yo u can go and see performance art here in L.A. In fact, in Santa Moni ca, there is a place especially for performance art.

 Well, Livia is talking about her performance art pi ece. “Piece,” here just means artwork. Livia says, it will really challenge peopl e’s “perception of reality.” Your “perception of something” is how you view it, how y ou see it, how you interpret it. “Reality” is that which is real, that which is true  – real life – how the world really is. Stephan says, “I don't really understand contem porary art.” “Contemporary” here means the same as modern – art that has been p roduced recently. You can use contemporary also as a noun, when describing a person who is the same age or lived at the same time – is really what we'r e talking about – as another person. So, we could say that F. Scott Fitzgerald a nd T.S. Eliot were contemporaries. They lived at the same time. I'm no t sure if they knew each other. I don't think so.

Anyway, Stephan is talking about contemporary art, which is modern art, art of our generation. Stephan says, “Is it supposed to re present something?” “To represent,” in art, means to symbolize, to have a m eaning beyond the normal appearance of whatever the thing is. For example, y ou might have a rose in your picture, in your painting, that represents love or represents goodness or passion or whatever it is you're trying to communicate with  the people looking at your art.

Livia says the artwork she made is “my interpretati on of how the rich oppress the poor.” “Interpretation” is how you, as an individua l, understand something, how you think it works, how you try to express it to an other person. In art, your interpretation is the way you see this particular p iece of art being expressed. Artists and actors will also talk about interpretat ion. “To interpret a role” means to act a certain part in a play or movie or drama, and  the idea here is that it is your idea of what that performance should be, your inter pretation of it. This artwork is Livia's interpretation of how the rich oppress the poor. “To oppress” (oppress) means to treat someone unfairly, to treat someone c ruelly. It's not an art term. It's a term really more common in politics or sociology.  Livia is interested, however, in expressing how the rich, people with a lot of mo ney, oppress the poor, treat the poor badly.

Stephan says, “Really?” which here means, “Is that true?” “Is that really true?” Livia says, “Yes, from a postmodern perspective.” “ Postmodern” is a term you will see in many places, in philosophy and science and i n art. It relates to things in art that were developed in a style that came after mode rnism. “Post” (post) as a prefix, means after. Postmodern art tends to have a  very, how we might say, “skeptical interpretation” of the world, a question ing interpretation of the world.

Stephan says, “Oh, I see.” Livia says, “You do?” St ephan says, “No. Not really,” meaning I don't really see. I don't really understa nd. “I don't think I'm cut out for

modern art,” Stephan says. “To be cut out for somet hing” is a phrasal expression meaning to be prepared for something, to be ready t o have or ready to do something. I don't think I'm cut out for playing the piano. I tried but I wasn't very good. I really did. I tried once about five, six ye ars, ago – didn't do very well. I'm not cut out for playing the piano.

Stephan says, “I prefer art to be representational. ” Something that is “representational” is something that shows things t he way they really are. When you look at a painting, you can say, “Oh, yes. That 's a car. That's a flower. That's a mountain.” That is representational art. Stephan says, “I just can't wrap my head around this.” “To wrap (wrap) your head around  something” means to be able to understand something, something that perhap s is very difficult or complex – “to wrap your head around something.”

Stephan says he cannot wrap his head around Livia’s  art. Livia says, “That's the point,” meaning that's exactly what I'm trying to d o. “It's supposed to challenge you and make you think.” Stephen says, “Well, it ce rtainly made me think.” Livia says, “It has?” meaning it has made you think? Step han says, “Yeah. It's made me realize that I've underrated paint-by-numbers al l these years.” “To underrate” (underrate) means not to appreciate something the w ay you should, to consider something less important or less valuable than what  it really is. Stephan says he underrated paint-by-numbers. “Paint-by-numbers” was  a type of painting. Well, it was a type of activity that was popular in oh, the 1970’s, when I was growing up. Usually, it's something that children now do, not a dults. Basically, you have a picture, a drawing, and you have little numbers, an d the numbers tell you what colors should go in that little space. Children oft en color in things that are numbered and have colors for them, at least they us ed to. I don't know. Maybe they don't anymore. Even among adults, paint-by-num bers was a popular activity, at least in the United States, during a c ertain period of time, as I say back in the 1970’s. At least, that's what I remembe r.

Well, Stephan thinks that paint-by-numbers, which i s not considered real art – it's not considered art that you would put in a museum –  Stephan is saying that that kind of art, that paint-by-numbers art, maybe was b etter than he thought it was. Of course, what he's doing here is he's insulting L ivia. He’s saying that, that pain- by-numbers art is better than your professional art .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time, at a no rmal speed.

[start of story]

Stephan: What’s that?

 Livia: It’s my latest artwork. It’s experimental.

Stephan: It’s, um...

Livia: Abstract. It’s part of a performance art pie ce I’m putting together. It’ll really challenge people’s perceptions of reality.

Stephan: I don’t really understand contemporary art . Is it supposed to represent something?

Livia: It’s my interpretation of how the rich oppre ss the poor.

Stephan: Really?

Livia: Yes, from a postmodern perspective.

Stephan: Oh, I see.

Livia: You do?

Stephan: No, not really. I don’t think I’m cut out for modern art. I prefer art to be representational. I just can’t wrap my head around this.

Livia: That’s the point. It’s supposed to challenge  you and make you think.

Stephan: Well, it’s certainly made me think.

Livia: It has?

Stephan: Yeah, it’s made me realize that I’ve under rated paint-by-numbers all these years.

# Government Reactions to Protests

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 895: Government Reactions to Protests.

This is English to English as a Second Language Pod cast number 895. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Tom and Marianne  about people who don't like what the government is doing and try to change  it. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Tom: Have you seen the news?

Marianne: No, what’s happening?

Tom: People in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.

Marianne: Wow, this is big. I thought the dictator would order a media blackout and we wouldn’t hear any news out of McQuillanland.

Tom: There is a media blackout, but people are usin g social media to tell the world what’s going on. Hundreds of thousands of pro testers are clashing with police, and the government is having no success put ting down the protests.

Marianne: Has it been violent?

Tom: It’s early days yet, but the government has al ready used tear gas and fired into the crowd. It’s hard to say how many people ha ve been hurt.

Marianne: So this may be the end of tyranny in McQu illanland.

Tom: Don’t bet on it. The dictator has ruled with a n iron fist and won’t hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.

Marianne:" Well, the protesters have a fighting cha nce and I’m betting that they’ll topple the government and that ruthless tyrant!

[end of dialog]

Our dialogue begins with Tom saying to Marianne, “H ave you seen the news?” Marianne says, “No. What's happening?” Tom says, “P eople in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying aga inst his government.” “To rise up against someone” means to fight against someone, us ually the government, or the people who are in charge. “To rise up against t he government” means to try to get rid of the government, the people running the government, to fight against them, to start a revolution.

Tom says, “The people in McQuillanland,” which is n ormally a nice place, “are rising up against the dictator.” A “dictator” (dict ator) is a political leader who has complete power, who doesn't listen to other people,  who doesn't let people have a voice in his or her government, someone who contr ols everything and usually, someone who is not very nice to people who don't li ke him. If I started to give the names of some dictators, I would have to be here for a couple of days, perhaps, before I finish. So, we'll just describe what a dic tator is and you can think of your own examples.

Tom says “The people in McQuillanland are rising up  against the dictator and rallying against his government.” “To rally” (rally ) means, in this case, to get together in the same place, to gather, to assemble,  especially if you are doing it for some sort of political reason, usually associat ed with protesting some action of the government. “To protest” means to oppose, to  be against, to say, “We don't want that anymore.” Marianne says, “Wow. This  is big,” meaning this is important or this involves a lot of people. “I thou ght the dictator would order” – would demand – “a media blackout.” “Media” (media) refers to television, newspaper, radio – nowadays, the Internet, Twitter – all of these are part of media. A “media blackout” is when the government de cides to close the newspapers, to close the televisions, to shut down or turn off the Internet connections, to stop people from getting informatio n about what's going on in their own country.

Marianne says that she thought the dictator would o rder this media blackout. Tom says, “There is a media blackout, but people ar e using social media to tell the world what's going on.” I included Twitter in m y description of “media,” but more specifically, Twitter is part of what we would  call “social media.” This is the new forms of technology like Twitter or Facebook th at allow people to share information with their friends and people they know  on the Internet very quickly.

 Tom says, “Hundreds of thousands of protesters are clashing with police and the government is having no success putting down the pr otests.” Tom talks about hundreds of thousands of “protesters.” A “protester ” is a person who protests, a person who tries to fight against some wrong that h e sees the government doing or that society is engaged in. “To clash” (clash) m eans to fight against someone, to oppose someone, often with physical force, with violence. “Protesters are clashing with police,” Tom says, “and the governmen t is having no success putting down the protests.”

“They’re having no success,” that is, there are not  able to put down the protests. “To put down” here is a phrasal verb meaning to sto p, especially when a government stops people who are opposed to it from protesting, from speaking. If the government put down the protesters, they would be silencing them.

Unfortunately, at least for the dictator, the gover nment has not been successful in putting down the protests, in stopping them. Marian ne says, “Has it been violent?” Has there been a lot of physical force th at has hurt or perhaps even killed people? Tom says, “It’s too soon to know tha t yet.” He uses the expression “it's early days yet.” “It's early days yet” means it's too soon to know. It's perhaps more common in British English than it is in Americ an English, this expression, “it's early days yet.”

Tom says “The government has already used tear gas and fired into the crowd.” “Tear (tear) gas” is a special kind of gas that is meant to hurt your eyes and make it difficult for you to continue any physical activity. It's what police would use with a large group of people, a large crowd of people that they were trying to get rid of, that they were trying to get to go home . “To fire into the crowd” means to use a gun and shoot into a group of people. This  obviously can be rather dangerous.

Tom says, “It's hard to say how many people have be en hurt.” Marianne says, “So this may be the end of tyranny in McQuillanland .” “Tyranny” (tyranny) is a cruel, unfair, mean government, where you have a di ctator or someone who is in the government or a group of people in the governme nt who are hurting the people, who are not letting the people be free. Tom  says, “Don't bet on it.” Don't bet on this being the end of tyranny in McQuillanla nd. “To not bet on something” means don't count on it, don't depend on it.

Tom says, “The dictator has ruled with an iron fist  and won't hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.” “To rule with an  iron (iron) fist (fist)” means to control or govern a population very strictly, to no t let anyone do anything that you

don't want them to do, especially those who don't l ike you, those who oppose you. A dictator often rules with an iron fist. The fist is just your hand that is, we use the verb “clenched” – it is put together like a  ball. That's your fist. A “iron fist” would be a fist that of course, would be very hard and well, it would hurt you if you got punched by an iron fist. But the expression  is “to rule,” to govern, “with an iron fist.”

Tom says, the dictator won't hesitate, will be very  willing, to use any means necessary to stay in power. The expression “to use any means (means) necessary” means to do whatever needs to be done. I f you have to kill someone, you kill someone. If you have to hurt someone, you hurt them. You will use any means necessary. The dictator will use any means ne cessary to “stay in power,” meaning to keep his power, to keep his control of t he government.

Marianne says, “Well, the protesters have a fightin g chance and I'm betting that they'll topple the government and that ruthless tyr ant.” “To have a fighting chance” means that they have a possibility of winni ng. It's not impossible for them to win. Marianne is betting that the protester s will “topple” the government. “To topple” (topple) means to overthrow, to put an end to a government, or the rulers of that government. “Ruthless” (ruthless) de scribes someone who is willing to do anything. It's connected with the expression,  “to use any means necessary.” Someone who is ruthless will do whateve r it takes to get what he or she wants. The dialogue talks about a ruthless “tyr ant” (tyrant). “Tyrant” is related to the word “tyranny,” and here really just means a  dictator.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.

[start of dialog]

Tom: Have you seen the news?

Marianne: No, what’s happening?

Tom: People in McQuillanland are rising up against the dictator and rallying against his government.

Marianne: Wow, this is big. I thought the dictator would order a media blackout and we wouldn’t hear any news out of McQuillanland.

Tom: There is a media blackout, but people are usin g social media to tell the world what’s going on. Hundreds of thousands of pro testers are clashing with police, and the government is having no success put ting down the protests.

Marianne: So this may be the end of tyranny in McQu illanland.

Tom: Don’t bet on it. The dictator has ruled with a n iron fist and won’t hesitate to use any means necessary to stay in power.

Marianne: Well, the protesters have a fighting chan ce and I’m betting that they’ll topple the government and that ruthless tyrant!

# Preparing a Speech

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 896: Preparing a Speech.

Our dialogue today is between Lourdes and Valerie, about giving a speech – talking to a large group of people. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialog]

Lourdes: I need help.

Valery: Sure, what’s up?

Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start  of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.

Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. Yo u start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.

Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.

Valery: After that, in your introduction, you shoul d tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the wa y, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to t alk about this topic.

Lourdes: All right.

Valery: Then, in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points, using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.

Lourdes: Okay.

Valery: And finally, in the conclusion, you restate  your main points and make some closing remarks. Simple, right?

Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.

Valery: Shoot.

Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20 th , and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be de athly ill?

[end of dialog]

Lourdes begins by saying to Valerie, “I need help.”  Valerie says, “Sure, what's up?” What’s going on? What's happening? Lourdes say s, “I'm supposed to give a speech at the start of the conference next month, a nd I don't know what to do.” A “speech” is a formal presentation, a spoken present ation in front of a group of people. Valerie says, “It's not that hard to plan o ut a speech.” “To plan out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to plan all of the de tails of something, to prepare for it completely, to have a very good idea about e verything you're going to do. Valerie says, “It's not hard” – it's not difficult – “to plan out a speech.” “You start with an attention getter using humor or telling a p ersonal story.” “To get someone's attention” means to get them to listen to  you, to get them to listen to the things you are saying. An “attention getter” wo uld be something at the beginning of your speech that will make everyone st op and listen to you. Sometimes you can tell a story, sometimes you can u se humor. “Humor” (humor) just means a joke, something funny, something that will make people laugh.

Lourdes says, “Okay. I guess I can do that.” She's not too sure. Valerie says, “After that” – after the attention getter – “in you r introduction, you should tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis stat ement.” Your “introduction” is the opening of your speech, the first part of your speech. There's an old rule that when you give a speech, when you give a formal talk , first, you tell people what you're going to tell them. Say, “I’m going to talk about this and this and this.” Then you tell them those things in the same order –  this and this and this – and then at the end, you tell them what you just told t hem, you summarize.

That's what Valerie is suggesting here. Lourdes sho uld tell the audience – the people listening to her – what the speech is going to be about in a “thesis statement.” A “thesis (thesis) statement” is usuall y associated with formal writing, an essay. Valerie is using this idea to help Lourde s understand what she's supposed to do. Your thesis statement in an essay, in a written essay, is a short

statement, usually one sentence, that gives the mai n idea of what you are going to talk about.

Valerie says, “Along the way, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you are qualified to talk about this topic.” “A long the way” is an expression we use to mean “as you are doing something.” This e xpression is often used when we are talking about traveling. “I'm going to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and along the way I'm going to stop at F resno to visit my friend.” “Along the way” – as I am traveling from one place to another.

Valerie, when using this expression, is telling Lou rdes that as she is giving her speech, she needs to establish her credibility. “To  establish your credibility” (credibility) means to demonstrate that you are kno wledgeable, that you are qualified, that you know something about this topic  that gives you the authority, gives you the right, if you will, to talk about it.  You know what you're talking about. If you're going to talk about the weather, y ou would want to know your audience will want to know why you are qualified to  talk about the weather. Do you have a degree in the science of studying the we ather, what’s called “meteorology”? That would help.

Valerie says that Lourdes should establish her cred ibility by mentioning why she's qualified to talk about this topic. “To be qu alified” means to have the knowledge or experience to do something. Lourdes sa ys, “Alright,” meaning okay.

Valerie says, “Then in the body of your speech, you  want to state your main points using supporting ideas, giving examples, and  maybe using visuals.” The “body (body)” of your speech is the main section, t he main part, where you tell people with details, the things that you told them you were going to tell them about in your introduction. We call these your “mai n points.” Your main points are your most important points, the most important mess ages that you want to give to your audience about your topic.

Valerie suggests using supporting ideas when talkin g about your main points. “Supporting” means helping. “Supporting ideas” woul d be ideas that help people understand what your main point is. It could be evi dence. It could be proof of what you are saying. You could also give them examp les of what you are talking about to help them understand. “Maybe,” Valerie say s, “you could use visuals.” “Visual” (visual) is something you can see. Visuals  are things that you use, often in a presentation or a speech, that shows people wh at it is you are trying to tell them about. It gives them something to look at. If you're talking about geography,

about where things are, a visual would be a map tha t would show people what you're talking about.

Lourdes says, “Okay.” Valerie then says, “And final ly, in the conclusion, you restate your main points and make some closing rema rks.” Your “conclusion” is at the end of your speech. “At the end of your spee ch,” Valerie says, “you should restate your main points.” “To restate” (restate) m eans to say again. The prefix “re-“ in English, is typically used to mean “again, ” to do something again. A “replay” is to play something one more time. Valeri e says, “You should restate,” or say again, “your main points and make some closi ng remarks.” “Closing remarks” are things you say at the very end of your  presentation – the “close” of your presentation.

Valerie says, “Simple, right?” Lourdes says, “Yeah,  simple. One last question.” Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Shoot” (shoot) is a phrase we use informally to tell the other person to continue asking the question. Usual ly, it's in response to another person who has said that he wants to ask you a ques tion. You may have someone come up to you and say, “Can I ask you a fa vor?” Can I ask you to do something for me? And you say, “Shoot.” You mean, “ Okay, ask me your favor. Tell me what you want me to do.” Lourdes wants to a sk Valerie a question, so Valerie says, “Shoot.” “Go ahead.”

Lourdes says, “What are you doing the morning of Ju ne 20 th , and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be deathly ill?” Lourdes is asking Valerie what he's going to do on a certain d ay – June 20 th  – and how he feels about, what is his opinion, about “standing i n for a coworker.” “To stand in for someone” is to take the place of another person  when that person isn't available, to do what they're supposed to do, espec ially in a work environment. Lourdes is joking, of course. She's asking Valerie if he  would like to give this speech, if he would like to “stand in” for his cowo rker. His coworker is the person he works with, in this case, Lourdes.

Lourdes plans to be “deathly ill” that day. “To be ill” means to be sick. “To be deathly ill” means to be so sick, you could die. On ce again Lourdes is making a joke here. She's hoping that Valerie will agree to do this speech since he seems to know everything about giving speeches.

Being a teacher and former professor, I've given lo ts of speeches. I like giving speeches. I don't think I’m very good at giving spe eches, but I like to give speeches. So, if your organization wants me to give  a speech, send me an email. I might not know what I'm talking about, but I'm ha ppy to give a speech!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed

[start of dialog]

Lourdes: I need help.

Valery: Sure, what’s up?

Lourdes: I’m supposed to give a speech at the start  of the conference next month and I don’t know what to do.

Valery: It’s not that hard to plan out a speech. Yo u start with an attention getter using humor or telling a personal story.

Lourdes: Okay, I guess I can do that.

Valery: After that, in your introduction, you shoul d tell the audience what your speech is about in a thesis statement. Along the wa y, you should establish your credibility by mentioning why you’re qualified to t alk about this topic.

Lourdes: All right.

Valery: Then, in the body of your speech, you want to state your main points, using supporting ideas, giving examples, and maybe using visuals.

Lourdes: Okay.

Valery: And finally, in the conclusion, you restate  your main points and make some closing remarks. Simple, right?

Lourdes: Yeah, simple. One last question.

Valery: Shoot.

Lourdes: What are you doing the morning of June 20 th , and how do you feel about standing in for a coworker who plans to be de athly ill?

Our scriptwriter has established her credibility ov er the years as being very qualified for this job. I speak of course, of our o wn Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.

This episode is a dialog between Rachel and Emeril about cooking something to eat. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Emeril: Can you hand me that pan?

Rachel: This pot?

Emeril: No, that pan over there. I need to pan-fry these vegetables.

Rachel: Wouldn’t be healthier if we steamed the veg etables or grilled them?

Emeril: Maybe, but for this meal, I’m frying them i n this pan.

Rachel: Okay, do you want me to heat this sauce in this saucepan?

Emeril: No, I’m going to microwave that right befor e I serve it.

Rachel: Have you considered simmering it in a sauce pan to get a better consistency?

Emeril: We don’t have time for that. Slice this mea t and marinade it before I broil it.

Rachel: Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperatu re so that the meat won’t get dried out.

Emeril: We’ll try that another time. Can you get th at cutting board and chop these carrots and dice these onions?

Rachel: Sure, but don’t you think...?

Emeril: What I think is that there will be six hung ry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. You’re  here to help, right?

Rachel: Yes, of course. That’s exactly what I was t rying to do.

[end of dialog]

Emeril begins by saying to Rachel, “Can you hand me  that pan?” “To hand (hand)” someone something means to give it to them with your hand. A “pan” (pan) is a metal object with a round bottom that we  use to cook food on what we call a “stove.” A “stove” (stove) is where you have  a small fire or heat that comes from below, and you put something on top of that he at in order to cook it. Usually, on a stove, we use what's called a pan.

Rachel is a little confused. She says, “This pot?” A “pot” (pot) is a kind of pan, but it's got very long sides so that it holds a lot of liquid, a lot of water. If you're going to make soup, you would use a pot. If you are going  to make some eggs, fry some eggs, you would use a pan.

Emeril says, “No, that pot over there. I need to pa n-fry these vegetables.” “To pan-fry” (fry) means to cook something with a littl e bit of oil in the pan over a very high heat. Rachel says, “Wouldn't it be healthier” – wouldn't it be better for your body – “if we steamed the vegetables or grilled the m?” Emeril wants to fry the vegetables in a pan with oil. Rachel wants to steam  or grill the vegetables. “To steam” (steam) means to cook something, especially vegetables, not in water, but in water vapor. So what happens is you have wat er that's boiling, that's very hot, and it's giving off heat. It's giving off wate r vapor, and you use the heat from that vapor to cook the food. You don't put the food  in the water. You don't put the food on a metal object like a pan.

“To grill” (grill) means to take the food and put i t over an open fire, so that the food isn't directly on a pan. It's on a piece of me tal that is over the heat source, is over the fire, in this case. You can grill lots of different kinds of food. We often associate grilling food with cooking food outside o ver an open fire, over a source of heat.

Emeril says, “Maybe” – maybe we could steam or gril l the vegetables – “but for this meal, I'm frying them in a pan.” Emeril is not  going to change his mind. He doesn't want to steam the vegetables over water. He  doesn't want to grill them

directly over the heat. He wants to pan fry them, p ut them into metal object called a “pan” and put that over the heat and add a little  oil.

Rachel says, “Okay. Do you want me to heat this sau ce in this saucepan?” “To heat” means to make hot, to warm something up. A “s aucepan” is a small pot that you use, typically, for making what are called  “sauces,” which is a liquid that you would eat with your food. That’s a saucepan. It 's not big enough, for example, to make pasta in, but you can put water or  other liquid in a saucepan. It's a small pot that you can use to make other kin ds of food.

Emeril says, “No.” No, he doesn't want Rachel to he at the sauce in a saucepan. He says, “I'm going to microwave that right before I use it.” “To microwave,” as a verb, means to cook something in a kitchen applianc e called a microwave oven. It's a special kind of oven that cooks using, you g uessed it, microwaves. Almost every American home, every American kitchen, has a microwave oven. They're very, very common here.

Rachel says, “Have you considered” – have you thoug ht about – simmering it in a sauce pan to get a better consistency?” “To simme r” (simmer) means to boil something but at a very medium heat, not too high o f a heat – “to simmer.” Usually, you simmer a liquid over a long period of time in order to get a better taste from it. Rachel is asking Emeril if he has th ought about simmering this sauce, this liquid he's making, in order to get a b etter consistency. “Consistency,” when we’re talking about food, is how thick or thin  or smooth the food is. For example, you can have a soup that has a very thin c onsistency. You can have a soup that has a thick consistency. A thick consiste ncy would be heavier. It would feel like there was more in your mouth if you took a spoonful and put it in your mouth.

Emeril who’s not very interested, obviously, in Rac hel's opinions, says “No. We don't have time for that. Slice this meat and marin ate it before I broil it.” “To slice” (slice) means to cut with a knife, typically to cut  food, usually in thin pieces. Americans typically buy bread that has already been  “sliced.” It's already been cut by a machine. “To slice,” then, means to cut.

Emeril is asking Rachel to slice this meat and mari nade it. “To marinade” (marinade) means to place a piece of meat or some v egetables usually in some sort of liquid for a long period of time so that the meat or the vegetables has a better flavor, a better taste. “Marinade” can also be a noun meaning that liquid you use to give it a better taste. Emeril wants Rac hel to marinate the meat before he broils it. “To broil” (broil) means to cook the outside of some food by putting it directly close to the flame, or the fire, or the he at source. It's similar to grilling, but

by broiling, at least in an American oven, is often  done on the very bottom of the oven. There's a separate section called a broiler a nd the heat source is usually above the food, and you put the food in underneath the heat to cook it. “Grilling” – you’re typically putting the meat or the food ove r the open flame, on top of the heat.

Rachel, who still wants to give her opinion, says, “Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperature so that the meat won't get dried out.” “To bake” (bake) means to cook something inside of an oven, surrounded by hot air. Rachel wants to bake the meat so that it won't get dried out. “To b e dried (dried) out” means that most or all of the liquid has left the food and it doesn't taste very good. It tastes dry. It tastes hard, not like it should.

Emeril says, “We’ll try that another time,” meaning  we’ll try that in the future someday. He's not interested in Rachel's opinion, a s I mentioned earlier. He tells her, “Can you get that cutting board and chop these  carrots and dice these onions?” A “cutting board” is a flat rectangular or  square piece of wood or plastic that you use to cut on. If you're going to be cutti ng something, you don't want to hurt or damage your kitchen, the tops of your what we would call “counters” in your kitchen – the space that you have to prepare y our food. So, you use a cutting board, a piece of wood or plastic you put u nderneath the food in order to cut it. Emeril wants Rachel to use a cutting board and chop carrots. “To chop” (chop) means to cut, usually a fruit or a vegetable  into smaller pieces. “To dice” (dice) means also, to cut fruit or vegetables into small pieces but even smaller than chopping. So, chopping, you’re cutting the foo d, the vegetables or the fruit, into large pieces. Dicing means to cut them into ve ry small pieces.

Rachel says, “Sure, but don't you think…” She wants  to offer another opinion. Emeril says, “What I think is that there will be si x hungry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. Y ou're here to help, right?” Rachel says, “Yes, of course. That's exactly what I  was trying to do.” Emeril is getting a little impatient with Rachel. He's tellin g her that she should stop offering her opinions and just do what Emeril says.

Emeril obviously has never been married.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed

[start of dialog]

Emeril: Can you hand me that pan?

Rachel: This pot?

Emeril: No, that pan over there. I need to pan-fry these vegetables.

Rachel: Wouldn’t be healthier if we steamed the veg etables or grilled them?

Emeril: Maybe, but for this meal, I’m frying them i n this pan.

Rachel: Okay, do you want me to heat this sauce in this saucepan?

Emeril: No, I’m going to microwave that right befor e I serve it.

Rachel: Have you considered simmering it in a sauce pan to get a better consistency?

Emeril: We don’t have time for that. Slice this mea t and marinade it before I broil it.

Rachel: Maybe we could bake it at a lower temperatu re so that the meat won’t get dried out.

Emeril: We’ll try that another time. Can you get th at cutting board and chop these carrots and dice these onions?

Rachel: Sure, but don’t you think...?

Emeril: What I think is that there will be six hung ry children coming through that door in an hour and I need to finish dinner. You’re  here to help, right?

Rachel: Yes, of course. That’s exactly what I was t rying to do.

# People of Different Ages

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 898 – People of Different Ages.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 898. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member by going  to our website and signing up. This episode is a dialog between Gloria  and Andy describing different ages. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Gloria:  I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.

Andy:  Oh, yeah?  I hadn’t noticed.

Gloria:  Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks  with these people so I thought I’d get to know some of them.

Andy:  That’s nice.

Gloria:  Did you see that thirty-something couple w ith a toddler and an infant? I’m really surprised they’re on this tour.

Andy:  I’m sure they know what they’re doing.

Gloria:  And how about that group of seniors?  Some  of them look like they’re in the mid- to late-seventies.

Andy:  They seem pretty spry to me.

Gloria:  But what really surprises me is that group  of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage children.  They’ll be a han dful.

Andy:  They seemed pretty well behaved to me.

Gloria:  And did you notice that woman in her early -forties and the forty-ish man each traveling alone?  She seemed nice, but he didn ’t seem too friendly.

Andy:  Maybe he’s using his time to size up everybo dy like you are.

Gloria:  Well, I wish there were more young adults in this group.  I like talking to young people.

Andy:  I think there will be plenty of people for y ou to talk to these two weeks when you’re not sightseeing.

Gloria:  Sightseeing?  Oh yeah, sightseeing.

[end of dialog]

Gloria says, “I'm surprised at the variety of peopl e on this tour.” “Variety” just means many different kinds of people. Andy says, “O h yeah? I hadn't noticed.” I didn't realize. Gloria said, “Well, we’ll be spendi ng the next two weeks with these people so I thought I'd get to know some of them.” Gloria and Andy are on some sort of tour, probably of a different city or a dif ferent state, maybe even a different country. They're getting to know the people who are  in the same tour group. Gloria says she is getting to know them and Andy sa ys, “That's nice.” Andy doesn't seem very interested, does he?

Gloria says, “Did you see that thirty-something cou ple with a toddler and an infant? I'm really surprised they’re on this tour.”  “Thirty-something” spelled (thirty- something) is an expression meaning someone who's i n their thirties. They could be 30, 31, 32, 33 all the way up to 39. That would be a thirty-something. If you are in your 20’s, you would be a twenty-something. If you are in your fifties, you would be a fifty-something and so forth. When you d on't know someone's exact age, but you think they're in their twenties or thi rties or forties, you can use this expression. “Toddler” (toddler) describes a young c hild, usually one, two, maybe three years old, who has recently learned to walk. A toddler is a young child but one who can walk. An “infant” (infant) is the same as a baby. This is someone who is not able to walk. “Infants” have to be carri ed from one place to another or maybe they can crawl on their hands and knees to mo ve themselves back and forth.

Gloria says she’s surprised to see the thirty-somet hing couple with a toddler and an infant on the tour. Andy says, “I'm sure they kn ow what they're doing,” meaning the parents know what they're doing so we s houldn't worry about it. I think Andy is also kind of saying to Gloria here, i f I may interpret the script for you, that perhaps Gloria is too interested in these  other people. Gloria might be someone who we would describe as “nosy” (nosy). Som eone who's nosy is always trying to find out what's going on in other people's lives, trying to find

things that are really not their concern, things th at are, we would say, none of their business.

Gloria says, “And how about that group of seniors?”  “Seniors” (seniors) describes an old person, especially someone who is retired, w ho is no longer working. Gloria says, “Some of them look like they're in the ir mid to late seventies.” When we use the prefix mid (mid) followed by a hyphen, i n front of words like sixties, seventies or twenties, thirties, forties – any age,  we mean they’re in the middle of that range. To say someone's in their mid-seventies  means they're probably 74, 75, or 76. If you're in your mid-thirties, you're p robably 34, 35, 36. You can also describe ages using the prefix “late.” He's in his late eighties. That means he's probably 87, 88, or 89, and of course, you could al so say early. He's in his early forties. He's 40, 41, 42, maybe 43.

Andy says that these seniors that Gloria is talking  about, “seem” or appear, “pretty” or very, “spry” to him. “To be spry” (spry ) means to have a lot of energy. It’s often used to describe an older person who has  perhaps a surprising amount of energy who’s more energetic than you may expect him to be. Gloria says, “But what really surprises me” – she continues to make o bservations – “is that group of middle-aged couples with their tween and teenage  children. They'll be a handful.” “Middle-aged (middle-aged) means you are in the middle of your lifespan. Usually, we think of the ages between, sa y, 45 and 65 maybe 70 nowadays, as being middle-aged or between 50 and 70 . I have to say that because I'm not yet 50 so I don't want to consider myself middle-aged, but I probably am.

Anyway, middle-aged would be people who are older b ut not retired – people who are probably still working in their 40’s, 50’s and 60’s. Gloria says that she's surprised that there is a group of middle-aged coup les, meaning usually husband and wife, with their tween and teenage children. “T eenage,” you probably know, is someone who is between the ages of 13 and 19 yea rs old. We call that person a teenager. The “teen” comes from the numbers thirt een, fourteen, fifteen and so forth. A “tween” (tween) is a newer word. It descri bes someone usually in the age bracket of nine to 12. Someone who isn't quite yet a teenager but they're not a child anymore, either. They’re not a young child. T hey're still children, of course. Nine to 12 is sometimes described now, in the last maybe 20 years or so as a tween.

I think one of the reasons that word was invented w as for advertising and marketing reasons. They wanted a term that would co ver children who perhaps had enough influence on their parents to make them buy things so they decided to target them. They decided to advertise directly to them. That's, in any case,

what a tween is – someone between the ages of nine and twelve. It could describe a boy or a girl but it's more often used t o describe girls.

Gloria says that that these children will be a hand ful. When we say someone or something is a “handful,” we mean it's a lot of wor k. It's going to be difficult. It's going to be challenging. Once again Andy does not a gree with Gloria. That's how you know they're married. He says that the children  seem pretty well behaved to me. “Well-behaved” means that they are not acting i nappropriately. They're not yelling. They’re not screaming. They’re quiet; they ’re respectful – that would be well-behaved. We use that expression when talking a bout children or perhaps students.

Andy doesn't agree with Gloria but Gloria continues  to go on and make her observations. She says, “And did you notice that wo man in her early forties and the forty-ish man, each traveling alone?” “Early fo rties,” we've already described. “Forty-ish” with the suffix (ish) at the end means approximately. This is an informal suffix that we put on words to indicate th at we’re not exactly sure. We’re saying it's kind of like that. You may ask, for exa mple, “Is it cold outside?” You could say, “Well it's cold–ish,” meaning it's sort of cold but it's not really cold or, “How hungry are you? Are you very hungry?” You can say, “Well I'm hungry-ish.” I'm not exactly starving, I'm not really hungry but  I'm a little hungry. This is very common now in conversational English - but informal  English, to be sure -  by adding “ish,” you are saying that you're not quite sure about something or you’re giving an approximate age in this case, when we say  forty-ish.

Gloria says that “The woman seemed nice but the man  didn't seem too friendly.” She’s describing these two people who are traveling  by themselves. Andy says, “Maybe he's using his time to size up everybody lik e you are. The verb “to size (size) up” is a phrasal verb, meaning to evaluate o r assess something, usually just by looking at them. You size up a situation or  you size up a person. There's also an idea here that you're doing it rather quick ly and that you're doing it by comparing them to, perhaps, other people. So a boss  might size up the people who are applying for a job, decide, “Well, I like t hat person, and that person is better than that person but not as good as this per son.” That would be to size up. It could also mean to look at someone and decide wh at you think they’re like. You think that's a friendly person. You think that' s a mean person just by looking at them. That, of course, is not a very good idea.

Gloria says, “Well, I wish there were more young ad ults in this group.” A “young adult” is a very general term to describe someone w ho's 18 years or older but usually younger than say, 30. Young adults tend to be 18, 19 – all the way up to 30, maybe even 35. I am no longer a young adult. Gl oria says, “I like talking to

young people.” Andy says, “I think there will be pl enty of people for you to talk to these two weeks when you're not sightseeing.” “Sigh tseeing” is what you do on a tour. You go and you visit famous places – museums and parks and that sort of thing. Gloria says, “Sightseeing? Oh yeah, sightsee ing.” She's forgotten that, of course, the main reason you go on a tour is not to meet the other people in the tour but to see the places that you are going to vi sit.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Gloria:  I’m surprised at the variety of people on this tour.

Andy:  Oh, yeah?  I hadn’t noticed.

Gloria:  Well, we’ll be spending the next two weeks  with these people so I thought I’d get to know some of them.

Andy:  That’s nice.

Gloria:  Did you see that thirty-something couple w ith a toddler and an infant? I’m really surprised they’re on this tour.

Gloria:  And how about that group of seniors?  Some  of them look like they’re in the mid- to late-seventies.

# Purchasing and Using an E-Ticket

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 899 – Purchasing and Using an E-Ticket.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 899. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Become a member of ESL P odcast by going to our website.

This episode is a story about using an electronic t icket to travel. Let’s get started. > I thought I would save time by purchasing my airlin e ticket online and checking in at the airport with my e-ticket.  I went onto the M cQ Air website and selected my flights.  The screen then prompted me to pay with a  credit card.  After I typed in my payment information, I got a confirmation receip t with my ticket number and my itinerary.  I printed out a copy of my e-ticket and I was ready to go – easy!
> But when I got to the airport, it was a different s tory.  I went up to a self-serve kiosk and swiped my credit card to bring up my acco unt.  The computer said that it couldn’t find my account.  I flagged down an emp loyee and she didn’t have any better luck, suggesting I stand in line at the chec k-in counter.
> I got in the long line and 45 minutes later, the em ployee helped me check in and gave me my boarding pass.  When I asked her what the problem was, she said she didn’t know and it was probably just a glitch i n their computer system.
> Well, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, especially if technology is involved!

Our story begins by me saying, “I thought I would s ave time by purchasing my airline ticket online.” “To save time” means to do something more quickly so that it won't take as much time. I decided I would save time by purchasing – buying – my airline ticket online – on the Internet – and ch ecking in at the airport with my e-ticket. “To check in” is a two-word phrasal verb,  meaning usually to present yourself at an event or at a location to register f or something. When we use it in

terms of airline travel, we mean to go to the airpo rt and to tell the airline, “Yes, I'm here. I want to get on the airplane.” You have to c heck in before you're allowed to go onto an airplane.

I said I was going to check in at the airport with my e-ticket. “E-ticket” stands for electronic ticket. It's a ticket that most airlines  in the United States now use. It's not a paper ticket that they send you like they use d to many years ago. I still remember those days. Instead, they just send you an  e-mail or they take you to a website. Now, you can print out your e-mail but tha t's not exactly the same as a paper ticket. An e-ticket is something that's done electronically and most tickets nowadays are e-tickets. I say that, “I went on to t he McQ Air website.” “To go on to a website” means to visit a website, to go to th at URL, that address on your web browser on your computer or your phone. I went onto the McQ Air website and selected, or picked, chose, my flights.

A “screen” is anything on an electronic device that  is used to display something, to look at something. A “screen” could also be some thing that's on a wall that you show a movie on. In talking about computers though,  the screen is a thing you're looking at. It could be a separate monitor from you r main part of your computer, or it could be, for example, on a smart phone such as an iPhone. It could be the part of the phone that you look at that, that the i nformation is displayed on. In our story, “screen” really means the same as the page t hat was on the screen.

“The screen prompted me to pay with a credit card.”  “To prompt (prompt) someone” means to tell them they should do a certai n action, to give them an indication that they should do something, to reques t that they do something. So, the website is prompting me – is asking me, if you will – to pay with a credit card. After I typed in my payment information -- my name,  my credit card number, and so forth – I got a confirmation receipt with my tic ket number and my itinerary.

A “confirmation receipt” is an electronic, in this case, document that shows that you have paid for something. You can print it out a nd show someone and say, “Look, I paid for this. I have a confirmation recei pt.” A “receipt” in general, is any piece of paper or e-mail that indicates that you ha ve purchased something. “Confirmation” is used here because we’re talking a bout making an airline reservation and when you make a reservation, when y ou say, “Yes, I want to fly on this day at this time,” the airline says back to  you, “Yes. Okay. You can do that.” They give you a confirmation of your reserva tion.

I say that, “I got a confirmation receipt with my t icket number and my itinerary.” Your “ticket number” is a number that is on your ti cket that is used to identify that ticket and that ticket only. Every ticket has its o wn ticket number. “Itinerary”

(itinerary) means your travel plans. An “itinerary”  is a list of all the important, in this case, airline flights that you are going to ta ke. Your complete itinerary might include the airline flights you're going to take, t he hotels you’re going to stay at, the tours that you may take – all that could be par t of your itinerary.

Sometimes people use the word “itinerary” to mean t heir travel schedule, everything they will be doing when they are traveli ng. Next, I say, “I printed out a copy of my e-ticket and I was ready to go.” “To pri nt out” means to make a paper copy of your electronic ticket. This, of course, is  kind of funny because the idea is that you would be saving paper, not using paper, by  having an electronic ticket, but the truth is most of us know that computers don 't always work the way they should. And so we print out a copy so we have proof  that we did what we said we did, in this case, that we purchased a ticket.

I say that, “When I got to the airport, it was a di fferent story,” meaning things did not go the way I planned them to go. I say, “I went  up to a self service kiosk and swiped my credit card to bring up my account.” Lots  of vocabulary in that sentence, let's take a look. “I went up to” means I  walked up to. I walked in the direction of and then stopped in front of something . You could go up to a person, or you could go up to, in this case, an object. The  object that the person is going up to, is walking up to, is a self-serve kiosk. “Se lf-serve” means there isn't anyone there to help you. You are doing everything yourself. You are serving or helping yourself.

A “kiosk” (kiosk), in American English, usually ref ers to a computer where people can go and get information, or buy things, without anyone helping them. In other countries, in other languages, “kiosk” means a litt le, something a little different, but when we talk about a “self-serve kiosk,” we’re talking about a computer or a machine that you can go and do things on. This kios k asked me to swipe my credit card.

“To swipe” (swipe) means to move something very qui ckly, especially a credit card or any other sort of bankcard through a machin e that reads the electronic information on the card. When you go to a store, th ere'll often be a little machine and you use that machine to put your credit card in formation into the electronic system of the store. You do that by moving the cred it card very quickly through the machine. The verb we use specifically for that action is “swipe.”

So, I swiped my credit card to bring up my account.  “To bring up” is a two-word phrasal verb that has a couple of different meaning s. Here, it means to retrieve or get information from a computer and have it be disp layed on the computer screen. “To bring up” can also mean to raise a chil d, to be a parent and/or a

friend who helps a child grow up, but here it means  simply to get information from the computer so you can see it. The computer, howev er, said that it couldn't find my account. “My account” here would be my informati on. “I then flagged down an employee.” “To flag (flag) down” is a two-word phra sal verb meaning, usually, to wave your hand in the air in order to get someone's  attention, to get them to come over and help you. We can flag down an employe e at an airport and ask them to help us.

That's what I'm doing in the story. You could also flag down someone else who you want to help you in some public space. You may flag down a police officer if you have a problem and you need his help or her hel p. I flagged down an employee but she didn't have any better luck, meani ng she wasn't able to find the information either. “So, she suggested that I stand  in line at the check-in counter.” “To stand in line” means to go and to wai t for someone to help you. The “check-in counter” is the place, usually a very lar ge desk at an airport where employees will help you check in. It's different th an the self-service kiosk where you're supposed to check-in yourself. The check-in counter is the place where they have real live human beings that will help you .

“I got in the long line and 45 minutes later, the e mployee helped me check in and gave me my boarding pass.” A “boarding pass” is a –  usually a small piece of paper that you're given that you have to give to the airline employee in order to get on the actual plane. So, you hold it. You keep it with you. It also proves that you are going to go on an airplane and is your only  way, typically, to get past the airport security. Now, in most American airports, y ou can't go up into where the people are getting on airplanes unless you have a b oarding pass, unless you are actually traveling. In the old days, you could just  go up to any airport and go through the security and sit and wait for someone t o leave or for someone to arrive. Nowadays, you can't do that. You have to ha ve a boarding pass to get past security. I asked the person what the problem was – why the computer couldn't find my information and I was told it was just a glitch in their computer system.

A “glitch” (glitch) is a technical problem, usually  a small problem related to the way the computer is working. It's not working corre ctly. It's an error. I end by saying that, “The best laid plans of mice and men o ften go awry.” This is an old expression that means even when we plan things very  carefully, sometimes things happen and our plan does not work out. Our p lan is not successful. “The best laid plans” would be the plans that are prepar ed the best. Even if we prepare good plans, they often go awry. “To go awry ” (awry) means to go wrong. There is a famous book in English called Of Mice an d Men.  You can learn about that in our Learning Guide.

 Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal speed.  > I thought I would save time by purchasing my airlin e ticket online and checking in at the airport with my e-ticket.  I went onto the M cQ Air website and selected my flights.  The screen then prompted me to pay with a  credit card.  After I typed in my payment information, I got a confirmation receip t with my ticket number and my itinerary.  I printed out a copy of my e-ticket and I was ready to go – easy!
> But when I got to the airport, it was a different s tory.  I went up to a self-serve kiosk and swiped my credit card to bring up my acco unt.  The computer said that it couldn’t find my account.  I flagged down an emp loyee and she didn’t have any better luck, suggesting I stand in line at the chec k-in counter.
> I got in the long line and 45 minutes later, the em ployee helped me check in and gave me my boarding pass.  When I asked her what the problem was, she said she didn’t know and it was probably just a glitch i n their computer system.
> Well, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, especially if technology is involved!

# Simplifying Information

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 900: Simplifying Information.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 900. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful, Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. That's been our website for 900 episodes. If you go there, you can become a member of ESL Podcast and g et a Learning Guide for most of those 900 episodes.

On this episode we’re going to listen to a dialog b etween Tara and Stan about explaining information to people in a simple way. L et's get started.

[start of dialog]

Tara:  How is your presentation coming along?

Stan:  It’s okay, but I’m having trouble simplifyin g some of the key concepts without dumbing them down too much.

Tara:  I think your instincts are right.  You’ll be  presenting to non-specialists, so it’s important to keep your presentation clear and simple.

Stan:  That’s my problem.  How do I capture the ess ence of all of this information without making it too simplistic?

Tara:  My rule of thumb is to think about which con cepts really jump out at me when I think about the topic and identify any patte rns in the information.  Then, I build my presentations around those things.

Stan:  That’s a good idea.

Tara:  I would also find a non-specialist and do a run-through and get his or her feedback.  That’s the best way to know if you’ve na iled it.

Stan:  That’s another good idea.  What do I owe you  for all of this good advice?

Tara:  There’s a new restaurant across the street I ’ve been meaning to try for lunch...

 Stan:  Say no more.  Lunch is on me.

Tara:  Really?  Let’s go right now before you chang e your mind!

[end of dialog]

Tara begins by saying to Stan, “How is your present ation coming along?” The expression “to come along” means to make progress. It's a phrasal verb meaning to advance toward some goal, to be in the process o f completing something. Tara wants to know how Stan's presentation is comin g along. A “presentation” would be when you give information to someone, usua lly in some sort of formal setting, some formal situation. Stan says, “It's ok ay, but I'm having trouble simplifying some of the key concepts without dumbin g them down too much.”

“To simplify” (simplify) means to make something le ss complex, to make something easier to understand. A “concept” is an i dea. A “key (key) concept” is your main idea, or your most important ideas. Stan is trying to simplify, or make easier to understand, some key concepts without “du mbing them down.” The expression “to dumb (dumb) something down (down)” m eans to make something too simple, too basic, so that you are changing the  meaning of something in an important way as you simplify it. “To dumb somethin g down” is to lose some important information as you try to make it easier to understand.

This expression was often used in criticizing Ameri can education in the 1980’s and 90’s. You will still hear it in other contexts,  when people talk about making things too simple in such a way that you are distor ting the reality that is being described. You are not describing accurately becaus e you are trying to make it too simple.

Tara says, “I think your instincts are right.” “Ins tincts” (instincts) are the reactions that you have or that an animal has that they are t ypically born with. We think of this more when it comes to animals than we do for h umans. When we talk about instincts for humans, we don't necessarily mean it' s something you are born with. It could just mean something that everyone seems to  have, because this is the way that human beings are brought up in a culture o r society. We may talk about a mother's love for her child as being a “maternal instinct” – the idea that a woman who is a mother will naturally want to take c are of her own child. Tara says that she thinks Stan's instincts are correct, not about taking care of children, but about trying to simplify the key concepts.

She says, “You'll be presenting” – you will be givi ng this information – “to non- specialists.” A “specialist” (specialist) is someon e who specializes in something, someone who's an expert in something. A “non-specia list” would be a person who is not an expert. If you work at a large compan y, for example, you probably have an IT department – an information technology d epartment. Sometimes people from IT departments will be talking to normal human beings, regular people, and they won't understand that the person t hey're talking to is not a specialist. So, they may use information or they ma y use descriptions that are difficult to understand. A “non-specialist” is some one who's not an expert.

Tara says, “It's important to keep your presentatio ns clear and simple because these are non-specialists.” Stan says, “That's my p roblem. How do I capture the essence of all of this information without making i t too simplistic?” The “essence” (essence) here means the most important part or the  most important parts. “To capture” (capture) here means to clearly explain, t o make sure that you're including all of the important parts. That's the me aning of “to capture the essence of something.” Stan wants to capture the essence wi thout it being too “simplistic.”

Something that is “simplistic” is too simple. It's related to the previous expression, “dumbing them down” or “dumbing something down.” Yo u don't want to dumb it down so that it's simplistic. “Simplistic” would be  a description that is not accurate because you are leaving important things out in ord er to try to make it easier for people to understand. When it's simplistic, people are understanding the wrong thing because you're not giving them all the inform ation they need.

Tara tries to help him by saying that, “My rule of thumb is to think about which concepts really jump out at me when I think about t he topic and identify any patterns in the information.” A “rule of from thumb  (thumb)” means a general guideline, something that isn't an official rule. I t isn't written down, but it's something you use to help you think about a certain  situation. For example, in the kitchen, my rule of thumb is to put the oven at 350  degrees Fahrenheit if I'm not sure how hot the oven should be. That's my rule of thumb. That's what I use when I'm not sure about something. So, a rule of th umb is a general rule that you apply in different situations. Tara says her rule o f thumb in preparing presentations is to think about which concepts real ly jump out at her. The expression “to jump out at someone” means to be the  thing that gets that person’s attention the most, to capture or catch so meone's interest or attention. Something that “jumps out at you” is something that  you notice immediately. It's something that you see is important right away.

Tara tries to find ideas that jump out at her and h elp her identify any patterns in the information. A “pattern” (pattern) is a repeati ng design or sequence,

something that you see over and over again. A, A, B , B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, A, B, B, B – that's a pattern, okay? Two A’s followed by three B’s.

Stan says, “That's a good idea.” He is going to tak e Tara’s suggestion of building his presentation around the things that jump out at  him. “To build a presentation” would mean to construct or to make the presentation . Tara says, “I would also find a non-specialist and do a run-through to get h is or her feedback.” A “run- through” is when you practice something in order to  prepare for some other event. You are going to go through it as a way of p racticing it. It's not the actual presentation. It's something you would do to prepar e yourself. Tara suggests finding someone who is a “non-specialist” and doing  a “run-through” to get his or her feedback or opinion. Tara says, “That's the bes t way to know if you’ve nailed it.” “To nail (nail) something” is an informal expr ession meaning to do it exactly the way you should've done it, to do something very  well.

Stan says, “That's another good idea. What do I owe  you for all of this good advice?” “What do I owe you?” means “What do I have  to give you as payment?” Tara says, “There is a new restaurant across the st reet I've been meaning to try for lunch.” Tara is suggesting that Stan take her t o lunch to thank her at a new restaurant that she wants to try near where they wo rk.

Stan says, “Say no more.” This is an expression tha t means I understand what you are saying completely. You don't need to tell m e anything else. “Say no more. Lunch is on me.” When someone says, “Lunch is  on me,” they mean they're going to pay for it. They’re inviting you t o lunch. Tara says, “Really? Let's go now before you change your mind.” “To change you r mind” means to change your opinion, to come to a different decision. Terr a wants to go immediately before Stan changes his mind, changes his opinion a bout taking her to lunch.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

[start of dialog]

Tara:  How is your presentation coming along?

Stan:  It’s okay, but I’m having trouble simplifyin g some of the key concepts without dumbing them down too much.

Tara:  I think your instincts are right.  You’ll be  presenting to non-specialists, so it’s important to keep your presentation clear and simple.

Stan:  That’s my problem.  How do I capture the ess ence of all of this information without making it too simplistic?

Stan:  Say no more.  Lunch is on me.

Tara:  Really?  Let’s go right now before you chang e your mind!

She simplifies without ever making it simplistic. I  speak, of course, of our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.



# Participating in a Clinical Trial

Welcomed English as a Second Language Podcast numbe r 901 – Participating in a Clinical Trial.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 901. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is ESLPod.com. Go there, download the L earning Guide, and become a member of ESL podcast.

This episode is a dialogue between Lucinda and Elan  about clinical trials. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Lucinda:  You look tired.  Are you all right?

Elan:  I’m fine.  It’s this clinical trial I’m enro lled in.  I’m suffering from some side effects.

Lucinda:  Are they serious?

Elan:  No, they’re not too bad.  I was told to expe ct some adverse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study.  I guess that’s why  only a small group of volunteers is taking part right now.  It’s so they can judge t he drug’s effectiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial.

Lucinda:  At least you know you’re not in the group  getting a placebo.

Elan:  Who knows?  I hope not.  If I successfully g et through this first phase, I’ll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.

Lucinda:  Then you may once and for all be rid of P odcaster’s Disease.

Elan:  I really hope so.  No one should go through life sounding like a podcaster.

[end of dialog]

Lucinda begins the dialog by saying, “You look tire d. Are you all right?” – are you okay? Elan says, “I'm fine. It's this clinical tria l I’m enrolled in.” A “clinical trial” is a

careful testing of some new drug or some new proced ure. They get people who are willing to be tested with this new drug or this  new treatment, and see what happens. In the United States, in order for a drug to be approved for use by the general public, by the average person, the drug com pany has to have these clinical trials to test what the drug does. Elan is  enrolled in a clinical trial. “To be enrolled in something” means to be signed up for so mething, to be registered for something. We often use this verb “to enroll” when talking about school. “I'm going to enroll at the university.” I'm going to si gn up or register to be part of the university.

Elan says, “I'm suffering from some side effects.” “To suffer from something” means to feel pain or some other negative effect of  some disease, or in this case, drug. A “side effect” is something that happens to your body – a negative thing that happens to your body – when you take a drug, o r undergo some kind of medical treatment. A side effect would be something  that is bad, but is not the same thing as what the disease or illness is. For e xample, you might take a drug to help you with your allergies, to help you so tha t you don't sneeze so much.

One of the side effects of the drug you take could be drowsiness, making you sleepy. That could happen as a side effect. It's no t the main reason. In fact, it's not the reason at all. You're taking the drug but i t has that side effect on you. It has that other thing that happens. That is not desi rable.

 Lucinda says, “Are they serious?” – are the side e ffects serious? Elan says, “No, they're not too bad. I was told to expect some adve rse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study.” An “adverse (adverse) reaction ” is a negative result, a negative effect – once again, a term that we usuall y associate with medical treatment. An adverse reaction would be, when you t ake a drug and something negative happens. It's like a side effect. Usually,  I think it's a little more serious than that. An adverse reaction might cause your doc tor to stop giving you the drug.

Elan said he was told to expect some adverse reacti ons in the first weeks of the pilot study. The “study” is just the trial, the per iod where they are studying this drug. A “pilot study” is a study that is a small ex periment, a small test before the main, larger study. A “pilot study” would involve f ewer people, perhaps for a shorter amount of time in order to see whether the drug was going to work at all and then if you got some positive results from a pi lot study, then you would do a larger study, the main study.

Elan says, “I guess that's why only a small group o f volunteers are taking part right now.” A “volunteer” (volunteer)” is someone w ho agrees to do something

either for free or without being required to do it.  You could ask for volunteers for something at your work, even though the person is b eing paid for it. We could consider them a volunteer because they don't have t o say yes.

Volunteers always have the option of not doing some thing. In many contexts, however, volunteer means not getting paid for somet hing. You do it just because you want to help. That would be one reason. This is  a volunteer for a pilot study. It's not clear to me that they are doing it for fre e. However, they could've just volunteered in the sense of agreeing to do it witho ut being required to do it. This small group of volunteers is taking part right now.  “To take part” means to participate, to have a role in something. I'm takin g part in the activity this afternoon. I'm going to be part of it. I'm going to  participate in it. These volunteers are taking part in the study.

Elan says, “It's so they can judge the drug’s effec tiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial.” T he drug is the medicine. “Effectiveness” would refer to whether it does what  it says it is supposed to do – whether it works. “Pharmaceutical” refers to a comp any related to making drugs and medicine. “Large-scale” means a lot of people, a lot of people involved in the study trial. “Trial,” remember, means the same as s tudy. So, Elan says that there are only a few volunteers taking part so that the d rug company, the pharmaceutical company, can decide whether the drug  is going to work or not, before they have a large-scale trial.

Lucinda says, “At least you know you're not in a gr oup getting a placebo.” A “placebo” (placebo) is something you are given in a  clinical trial that looks like a drug, or it looks like medicine, but it's not reall y. It's nothing that would help you or hurt you. The reason that they use placebos in c linical trials is to test to make sure that people are not getting better for psychol ogical reasons, rather than for physical reasons. So, the placebo is given to a gro up of people who aren’t told, of course, that it's not the real drug.

Elan says, “Who knows?” meaning “Who knows whether I'm getting a placebo or not?” “I hope not. If I successfully get through th is first phase I'll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.” “Phase” (phase) here – it j ust means stage or step or a period, one part of something. A drug trial, a drug  study, could have a number of different phases. The first phase is the pilot stud y. The second phase could be a large-scale trial. The third phase could be another  large-scale trial and so forth. So, phase is just a general term for a period or st age or step.

A “dose of a drug” is an amount of medicine that yo u usually take at one time. If you have a headache, the doctor might tell you to t ake two aspirin. That would be

your dose – two aspirin. There’s an old joke, the d octor will tell you, “Take two aspirin and call me in the morning. If you come in and complain about something.” The idea is the doctor doesn't really w ant to help you and is just trying to get rid of you.

Lucinda says to Elan, “Then you may once and for al l be rid of Podcaster’s disease.” “Once and for all” means finally, conclus ively, without any remaining amount that is not done. “Once and for all” is the end of something. Lucinda says that Elan may once and for all be rid of Podcaster’ s disease. “To be rid of something” means to no longer have something, espec ially something that you don't really want or like or that is unpleasant. I am finally rid of my neighbor’s dog. The dog is no longer at my neighbor's house. I am r id of the dog.

Podcaster’s disease is when a person can't stop tal king and they always talk like they are producing a podcast. That is what Elan has . Elan says, “No one should go through life” – no one should live – “sounding l ike a podcaster.” Personally, Elan, I think it's the best thing that could happen  to you. You should be so lucky as to have Podcaster’s disease.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Lucinda:  You look tired.  Are you all right?

Elan:  I’m fine.  It’s this clinical trial I’m enro lled in.  I’m suffering from some side effects.

Lucinda:  Are they serious?

Elan:  No, they’re not too bad.  I was told to expe ct some adverse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study.  I guess that’s why  only a small group of volunteers is taking part right now.
