The topic today is called “Moving in Together.”  Let's listen.  > My girlfriend and I have been going out for a year and I thought it was time to have a heart-to-heart with her.  Simon:  I have something I want to talk to you about.  Can you come over here and sit down for a minute?  Paula:  Uh oh.  Is something wrong?  Simon:  No, nothing’s wrong.  In fact, everything’s right.  We’ve been together for a year and I’ve been happier than I’ve ever been.  Paula:  Me, too.  Things are going great.  What is this all about?  Simon:  I want us to move things to the next level.  I want us to move in together.    Paula:  Simon, I love you, but we can’t do that.  You know how conservative my parents are.  They would never approve.    Simon:  They like me, don’t they?  Paula:  It’s not a matter of whether they like you or not.  They both adore you as much as I do.  But two people moving in together before they’re married goes against their beliefs and mine.  Simon:  But don’t you want to?
