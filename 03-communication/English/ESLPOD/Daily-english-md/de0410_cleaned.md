This episode is called “Being Evasive.”  Someone who is “eva sive” doesn’t tell you the truth; gives you the half truth, but not the w hole truth.  It’s a dialogue between a daughter and her father, and the father h as difficulty answering the questions of his daughter.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Olivia:  Dad, can I ask you a question? 

Dad:  You just did. 

Olivia:  I mean, can I ask you another question? 

Dad:  Ask away. 

Olivia:  Where do babies come from? 

Dad:  What?  Where did you come up with that one? 

Olivia:  I don’t know. 

Dad:  Let me tell you.  That’s for grown-ups to know.  You’re just a pipsqueak. You mind your own business and I’ll tell you when you’re a little older. 

Olivia:  Why can’t you tell me now? 

Dad:  No comment. 

Olivia:  Dad, what does no comment mean? 

 Dad:  That’s confidential. 

Olivia:  Why is it confidential? 

Dad:  That’s personal. 

Olivia:  Dad, just tell me.     

Dad:  Never you mind. 

Olivia:  But I want to know! 

Dad:  And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and  quiet in this house.   

Olivia:  Oh, Dad. 

Dad:  Don’t “oh, Dad” me.  Just wait and see.  You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older. 

Olivia:  But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babie s come from? 

Dad:  I’m out of answers.  Go ask your mother. 

Olivia:  I did.  Mom said to ask you. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Olivia saying, “Dad, can I ask you  a question?” and Dad says, trying to be funny, “You just did,” meaning if you a sk someone if you can ask a question, of course, you’re asking a question already.   So, Dad’s a funny guy.  Olivia says, “I mean, can I ask another question?” – a n additional question. Dad says, “Ask away.”  This is a phrase, “ask away,” that we use  to invite someone to ask whatever questions he or she wants to ask.  I t’s saying you can ask me anything: “ask away.”  So Olivia says, “Where do babie s come from?” This, of course, is one of those questions that children ask their parents at some point, at some age.  Parents often have a difficult tim e explaining this for reasons you probably understand. 

Dad says, “What?  Where did you come up with that one?”  Dad is a little surprised; he says, “Where did you come up with that one.”   To “come up with” something means to think of something, to have an idea.  You might even say,  

 “I’ve come up with a plan to save the environment” – I’ve  thought of, I have created in my mind. 

So, Dad is asking where she came up with this question – h ow did she think of this.  Olivia says, “I don’t know.”  Dad says, trying to exp lain it to her, “Let me tell you.”  This is a phrase you use if you are an expert, if yo u know a lot about a subject or a topic.  It tells the other person I know wha t I’m talking about: “Well, let me tell you.”  Sometimes people use that to empha size the point they are about to make.   

Dad says, “That’s for grown-ups to know,” meaning the an swer to your question is not for children but for adults.  “Grown-up” is a noun referring to someone usually over the age of 18, maybe 21.  Dad says, “You’re j ust a pipsqueak.”  This is an interesting word; “pipsqueak” (pipsqueak) is an  informal term for someone who is small or not very important.  We often use this fo r a young child.  It’s usually a negative term to describe a young child.   

Dad says, “You mind your own business and I’ll tell you whe n you’re a little older.”  To “mind your own business” means to pay atten tion to things that are part of your own life – your own experience, not to wo rry about other people or other things that you don’t need to know about.  So, D ad is saying you don’t need to know the answer to that question.  “Mind your own bu siness” is somewhat of a negative expression as well.  It’s saying I’m not going to answer your question; it’s none of your business; it’s not anything that concerns you; you don’t have a right to know the answer. 

Olivia says, “Why can’t you tell me now?”  Dad responds by sa ying, “No comment.”  Usually, this is an expression you’ll hear a po litician or a famous person say when a reporter or a journalist from a newsp aper or a television station asks a question.  When the person doesn’t want to give an answer, they’ll simply say, “No, comment.”  Dad is being, again, a littl e funny here, because it’s his own daughter who’s asking the question.  “Comment” has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word. 

Olivia says, “Dad, what does no comment mean?”  She doesn ’t really understand the expression; it’s something you see in the news mostly.  Dad says, “That’s confidential.”  Remember, Dad is being “evasive,” meani ng he’s trying not to answer the question, or only answer part of the question .  Usually, this is a sign of someone who is trying to hide something, or perhaps so meone who is dishonest – not honest.  So Dad says the answer is confiden tial.  Again, he’s  

 trying to be funny a little bit.  Something that is “confidential” is information that you do not give or share with other people; it’s secret information. 

Olivia then asks, “Why is it confidential?” and Dad answers,  “That’s personal.” Here, when you say something is “personal,” you mean it’s only for one specific or single person, not something for everyone.  People ma y talk about their “personal lives,” meaning their life outside of work, ou tside of the public view, things that no one else needs to know about.  Again, D ad, always the joker, says “That’s personal,” meaning it’s just for me to know.  “ Personal” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that word. 

Dad then hears Olivia say something that you would hear from someone who really wants to know something, especially a child.  Olivia  says, “Dad, just tell me.”  “Just tell me” – please tell me.  Dad says, “Never you mind.”  This means you don’t need to know something, and you should stop aski ng me about it.  It’s a bit old-fashioned; it’s a bit of an older expression : “Never you mind.”  It does not mean exactly the same thing as “never mind.”  “Never mind ” means it’s not important, don’t worry about it.  For example, when yo u are asking someone a question and they can’t understand your question, after  a few minutes you may say, “Oh, never mind.  It’s not important.”  “Never you m ind” means you should stop asking me this question. 

Olivia says, “But I want to know!”  Dad responds by saying, “ And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and quiet in this house.”  The  expression “peace and quiet” means a time and a place where everything is calm .  “Peace” means no fighting, no shouting, no loud noises.  “Quiet” means p retty much the same thing; the opposite of loud is quiet. 

Olivia then says, “Oh, Dad,” which is something a child wo uld say when they are frustrated, when they don’t like what is happening: “Oh , Dad.”  In this case, she’s mad at her father, or disappointed.  Her father respo nds, “Don’t ‘oh, Dad’ me. Just wait and see.”  The expression “don’t (something) me ” is a phrase we use to show that you are not happy with what the other person  said.  It’s a phrase to show your frustration or irritation at someone.  So Ol ivia says, “Oh, Dad,” and Dad responds, “Don’t ‘oh, Dad’ me,” meaning don’t say t hat to me, don’t say that expression “oh, Dad.” 

Dad says, “Just wait and see,” meaning wait and see what will happen in the future.  Dad says, “You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older.”  Olivia says, “But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babies com e from?” – where do we get babies?  Dad says, “I’m out of answers.  When you  say you are “out of”  

 something, you mean you don’t have any more of that thin g.  So Dad is saying I don’t have any more answers: “I’m out of answers,” and t hen he says what all good parents say, in this case fathers, “Go ask your mothe r.”  When you don’t want to deal with what your child is asking you, you send t hem to the other parent. 

Olivia said, “I did (meaning I did ask Mom).  Mom said t o ask you.”  Of course, the parents are sending the child back and forth because neither wants to answer the question. 

We won’t answer the question here.  If you don’t know w here babies come from, just wait and see! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Olivia:  Dad, can I ask you a question? 

Dad:  You just did. 

Olivia:  I mean, can I ask you another question? 

Dad:  Ask away. 

Olivia:  Where do babies come from? 

Dad:  What?  Where did you come up with that one? 

Olivia:  I don’t know. 

Dad:  Let me tell you.  That’s for grown-ups to know.  You’re just a pipsqueak. You mind your own business and I’ll tell you when you’re a little older. 

Olivia:  Why can’t you tell me now? 

Dad:  No comment. 

Olivia:  Dad, what does no comment mean? 

Dad:  That’s confidential. 

 Olivia:  Why is it confidential? 

Dad:  That’s personal. 

Olivia:  Dad, just tell me.     

Dad:  Never you mind. 

Olivia:  But I want to know! 

Dad:  And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and  quiet in this house.   

Olivia:  Oh, Dad. 

Dad:  Don’t “oh, Dad” me.  Just wait and see.  You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older. 

Olivia:  But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babie s come from? 

Dad:  I’m out of answers.  Go ask your mother. 

Olivia:  I did.  Mom said to ask you.
