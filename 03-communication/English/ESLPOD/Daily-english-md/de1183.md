[start of dialogue]

Julia: Stop poisoning us! Stop poisoning us!

Robert: Why are you picketing in front of this fact ory?

Julia: This factory is polluting our air and water.  They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemic als and waste.

Robert: But your entire family works here. Aren’t y ou concerned you’ll cause trouble for them and the other workers?

Julia: What’s more important is their health. The a ir quality in and out of this factory is at toxic levels and it’s endangering the ir health, not to mention what it’s doing to the ozone.

Robert: That’s terrible. Maybe I should help you pi cket.

Julia: Here’s a sign.

Robert: Okay, but maybe picketing is taking things a little too far.

Julia: No way! Did you know that runoff from the fa ctory has tainted the groundwater? Did you know that workers and people i n the community are breathing in dangerous particulate matter?

Robert: I didn’t know that. Do you have proof of al l that?

 Julia: Of course I have proof. Environmental groups  have done independent tests.

Robert: Then it’s actually dangerous for me to be s tanding here talking to you and breathing in this toxic air.

Julia: That’s true and your willingness to help me picket is really commendable. Hey, where are you going?

[end of dialogue]

Julia begins our dialogue by shouting – she’s shout ing, saying in a very loud voice – “Stop poisoning us!” “ To poison” (poison) someone is to make someone sick or even kill them by exposing them or giving t hem some sort of dangerous chemicals. Robert asks Julia, “Why are you picketin g in front of this factory?” A “factory” (factory) is a place where things are mad e.“To picket” (picket) means to stand in front of a building, usually carrying sign s and shouting your disagreement about something that is going on insid e the building. Another verb we might use here is “to demonstrate.”

Julia says, “This factory is polluting our air and water.” “To pollute” (pollute) means to make the air, the water, and/or the land d irty and unsafe, usually because you’re using some sort of unhealthy or harm ful substance. We usually refer to polluting the “environment,” the world aro und us – the air, the land, the water that we have in our environment, in the area around us, in the place where we live.

Julia says, “They’re responsible for contaminating the environment with dangerous chemicals and waste.” “To contaminate” (c ontaminate) means to make something unsafe by mixing something in that d oesn’t belong there – something harmful. It’s often used to mean the same  as “to pollute.” Julia is complaining about the company contaminating the env ironment, the natural world, “with dangerous chemicals and waste.”

“Chemical” (chemical) here refers to some sort of s ubstance or material that has been prepared artificially by man, by human beings,  although the word “chemical” has a much broader definition. It could refer to things that you find in nature as well – in the human body, for example. “W aste” (waste) can mean garbage or trash. In general, it refers to things t hat you no longer are using anymore, or perhaps things that are produced when y ou are making something else that you can’t use and you want to get rid of.

 Robert says to Julia, “But your entire family works  here. Aren’t you concerned you’ll cause trouble for them and the other workers ?” Robert is concerned that Julia is picketing a place where her own family mem bers work. Julia is not. She says, “What’s more important is their health.” She’ s saying their health is more important than any harm that could come to them, an y trouble they could get into because she is there picketing.

“The air quality in and out of this factory is at t oxic levels and it’s endangering their health, not to mention what it’s doing to the  ozone.” “Air quality “refers to how clean the air is, if you want to think of it th at way. Big cities like Los Angeles often have poor air quality, although the air quali ty in Los Angeles has gotten a lot better in the past 25 years or so. Julia thinks  the air quality inside as well as outside of the factory is at “toxic levels.” “Toxic ” (toxic) means poisonous, something that could harm you or kill you, like lis tening to Britney Spears, for example –definitely toxic.

Julia says the air quality is endangering her famil y’s health – the ones that work there at the factory. “To endanger” (endanger) mean s to put someone in a situation where they could get harmed or to put som eone in a dangerous situation. Julia thinks that the factory is “endang ering” the health of her family members, “not to mention,” which here means in addi tion to, “what it’s doing to the ozone” (ozone).“Ozone” is a gas, but here Julia  is using “ozone “as a shorter form of “ozone layer,” which is gas that is high up  in the atmosphere.

There is a concern that certain chemicals that we u se here on Earth might damage the ozone layer, and that might cause us fur ther problems here on Earth. Robert says, “That’s terrible. Maybe I shoul d help you picket.” Julia says, “Here’s a sign” (sign).A “sign” is a thick piece of  paper or cardboard or metal that has words or images on it in order to communicate a  certain message. People picketing a company will often walk around with sig ns that are on sticks or pieces of metal, and they hold the signs up in the air so people can see them as they’re driving by or walking by.

Robert says, “Okay, but maybe picketing is taking t hings a little too far.” “To take something too far “means to go beyond the limit of what is acceptable or even what is a good idea in order to get what you want t o get. Julia disagrees. She says, “No way. Did you know that runoff from the fa ctory has tainted the groundwater?” “Runoff” (runoff) is water that drain s away from or flows away from an area of land or a building.

The water could have other chemicals in it – other things that may pollute the water. If the water then goes into a lake or a rive r or down into the ground, it could pollute other water – water that you use to d rink. That’s what Julia is concerned about here. She’s concerned about the “gr oundwater” (groundwater).Groundwater is water that is found fa r below the surface of the earth and that is sometimes used for drinking. Juli a is concerned that the water coming from the factory has “tainted the groundwate r.” “To taint” (taint)here means the same as “to contaminate.”

She says, “Did you know that workers and people in the community are breathing in dangerous particulate matter?” “Particulate (par ticulate) matter” are very small pieces of something. Robert says, “I didn’t know th at. Do you have proof of all that?” “Proof” (proof) is evidence – something that  demonstrates that something is true.

Julia says, “Of course I have proof. I read it on t he Internet.” No, she doesn’t say that. She says, “I have proof. Environmental groups  have done independent tests.” Something that is “independent” (independen t) is separate from the things around it. It’s not connected to the things around it or the organizations around it. Here I’m guessing that she means that these environ mental groups have done tests not in conjunction with, or perhaps even with , the approval of the company that is supposed to be polluting in our dialogue.

Don’t confuse the word “independent” with another t erm, “objective” (objective). “Objective “would refer to something that is just t he facts, that only has the factual information or evidence and isn’t trying to  give you a certain conclusion regardless of what the facts are.“Independent” just  means it was done by someone not in the company, in this case. That pers on may still have their own particular biases, of course.

Robert says, “Then it’s actually dangerous for me t o be standing here talking to you and breathing in this toxic air.” Robert realiz es that if what Julia says is true, he shouldn’t even be there talking to her because t he air is toxic. Julia says, “That’s true and your willingness to help me picket  is really commendable.” “Commendable” (commendable) means admirable or wort hy of praise – something that you would congratulate someone on be cause they are doing a good thing.

Julia is congratulating or thanking Robert for bein g there with her even though it’s dangerous. Then she realizes that Robert is not, in  fact, going to stay there. She says, “Hey, where are you going?”meaning of course that Robert is now walking away from Julia. He’s not going to stand there if h e is going to be in any danger.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
