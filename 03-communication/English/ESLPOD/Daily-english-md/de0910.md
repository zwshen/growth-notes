This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Samanth a about someone who is cheating in school. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Paul:  All done.

Samantha:  You’re done with your paper?  How can th at be?  I’m just getting started.

Paul:  I’m just a better student than you are.

Samantha:  Let me see that.  You didn’t write this.

Paul:  No, I didn’t.  I downloaded somebody’s paper  from some website and slapped my name on it.  The professor will never kn ow.  Wise up.  Do you want me to find one for you?

Samantha:  No way!  Not only is it cheating, if you  get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.

Paul:  Don’t be such a goody two-shoes.  Everybody does it.  I know a guy who pays somebody in another state to write all of his papers for him and another guy who lifts his papers from old books.  Don’t tell me  you’ve never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your ow n.

Samantha:  Are you kidding me?  Borrowing ideas fro m a book with proper attribution is what you’re supposed to do.  You, on  the other hand, are plagiarizing your way to your degree.

Paul:  Damn straight!  Look who’s done with his hom ework and who is still working on hers.

Samantha:  I’d rather earn what I get and know that  I didn’t shortchange myself out of an education!

Paul begins our dialog by saying, “All done,” meani ng “all finished.” I'm completely finished with whatever I was doing. Sama ntha says, “You’re done with your paper?” “Paper” here, when we are talking  about school, refers to an essay or another written document that is required as part of your homework. It could be a report on a book. It could be an analysis of some subject – any of those things would be called a “paper.”

Samantha says, “How can that be?” “How is that poss ible?” she means. “I'm just getting started,” meaning I'm just getting started on my paper. Paul says, “I'm just a better student then you are.” Samantha says in re ply, “Let me see that. You didn't write this.” Samantha is saying that Paul di dn't even write this paper that he said he completed.

Paul says, “No, I didn't. I downloaded somebody’s p aper from some website and slapped my name on it.” Paul says that he bought, h e purchased, or at least, he downloaded from the Internet, this paper and then “ slapped” his name on it. “To slap (slap) on something” means to add something, u sually something to a written document.

Let's say you're preparing a report for your boss a nd, you, at the very last minute, right before you need to give it to him, you rememb er that you didn't put a conclusion on it. You didn't summarize your finding s. So, you decide to “slap on” a conclusion. It means to add something to a docume nt very quickly, but not very carefully, often done without a lot of preparation.

It's not a good idea to slap something on a documen t right before you need to turn it in. That's, however, what Paul is saying ab out his name. He slapped his name on this document. He just changed the name and  put his own name on it.

He says, “The professor” – the teacher, the instruc tor – “will never know. Wise up. Do you want me to find one for you?” Paul is sa ying that the professor will never discover that this is not his paper, and he t ells Samantha to “wise up.” “To wise up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to unde rstand something about the real world, about the way things really work. We of ten use this expression when

someone seems innocent or what we would describe as  “naïve” (naïve). Someone who's naive is someone who doesn't have a l ot of experience, who thinks things are more honest, perhaps, than they r eally are, or who thinks that people are more honest than they really are.

Paul is saying that Samantha should wise up, and th en offers to find a paper for her. Samantha, however, says, “No way. Not only is it cheating, if you get caught, you could flunk the class or get expelled.” Samanth a is not going to do what Paul did. She's not going to be dishonest. She's not going to cheat. “To cheat” (cheat) is to get something unfairly, to win a game unfairl y, or to get a grade that you don't deserve because you did something that you we ren't supposed to do.

Samantha says, “If you get caught,” meaning if some one finds out about this bad thing that you did, “you could flunk the class.” “T o flunk” (flunk) means not to pass a class in school, to get what we would call a  failing grade, or a failing mark. Usually, that means getting an “F.” That means that  you failed, that you flunked, that you did not pass the class.

That happened to me a couple of times. I took Germa n once and flunked, but I didn't really complete the course, and then I also took a class in computer programming back in the 1980’s. I believe it was “C OBALT” (Cobalt). I flunked that class, too. So, even professors flunk classes.

Samantha is telling Paul that he will flunk this cl ass if he is caught, or possibly get expelled. To be or to get “expelled” (expelled) mea ns that you are told you must leave the school, leave the university. You can no longer be a student here. It's the worst possible punishment you can get. It means  you can no longer go to school at that place.

Paul is not too worried, however. He says to Samant ha, “Don't be such a goody two-shoes.” This is an old expression – a “goody (g oody) two (two) [-] shoes (shoes).” When you call someone a “goody two-shoes, ” it means that this is a person who always follows the rules. It's an insult ing term, however. It's something that you are saying to criticize someone.  Someone who’s a goody two-shoes is too good, is too honest, is too willin g to follow the rules, instead of doing what everyone else does. Of course, this is a  very relative description; that is, it depends on who you are and what the situatio n is. Usually, however, it is used as an insult, especially among children.

Paul then says that “Everybody does it,” meaning ev erybody cheats. “I know a guy” – I know a man – “who pays somebody in another  state to write all of his papers for him and another guy” – another person – “who lifts his papers from old

books.” Paul is saying he has two friends, or two p eople he knows: one of them pays someone else to write his papers, another one steals his papers from old books. He copies old books.

Paul says, “Don't tell me you've never paraphrased ideas from a source and represented them as your own.” “To paraphrase” (par aphrase) means to express someone else's ideas, but in your own words, using your own words to give the same idea. A “source” (source) is where you get inf ormation from. It could be a book. It could be the Internet. It could be a frien d – all of those could be sources of information. “To represent something” means to p resent it in a certain way. Paul is saying that even Samantha has taken other p eople's ideas and called them her own. She's represented them as her own.

Samantha says, “Are you kidding me?” Are you joking ? She says, “Borrowing ideas from a book with proper attribution is what y ou're supposed to do.” She’s saying that if you take an idea from another source , you need to have proper “attribution” (attribution). “Attribution” is a sta tement indicating where you got this idea from, or where you got this quote from. She sa ys, “You on the other hand are plagiarizing your way to your degree.” Samantha  is saying that Paul is plagiarizing his way to his degree. “To plagiarize”  (plagiarize) means to take someone else's words and use them as if they were y our own, to take someone else's writing and say that it was your writing. Th at is “to plagiarize.” And of course, that is dishonest and not allowed by any sc hool – any good school, anyway. A “degree” (degree) is the same as a diplom a. It's an official piece of paper showing that you have completed your studies at a university or college.

Paul, however, is not going to change his mind. Whe n Samantha says that he's plagiarizing his way to his degree, he says, “Damn straight.” This is somewhat of a vulgar expression. “Damn” (damn) when you say it in anger or in excitement, is a vulgar, impolite phrase. Often, you say it when y ou are angry about something. Here, however, Paul is using it as a way of emphasi zing. “Damn straight” means you are in complete agreement with the other person . You agree with the other person in everything they say. You're saying, “Yes,  that's correct. I agree with you.” But you use it usually in cases where you are  trying to emphasize to the other person how much you agree with that statement .

Again, it's a vulgar expression. You shouldn't use this at work. You shouldn't probably use it at all. You could say, instead of “ Damn straight,” you could say, “Absolutely!” or “Yes, that's absolutely right.”

Paul continues by saying, “Look who’s done with his  homework and who is still working on hers.” He’s saying, “I'm done with my ho mework. You're still working

on your paper.” Samantha says, “I'd rather earn wha t I get and know that I didn't shortchange myself out of an education.” “To earn it” means to get it by working. “To shortchange yourself out of something” means to  give someone less than what they deserve, to cheat someone out of what the y should be getting. “To shortchange someone out of something” is to be dish onest with them. Samantha is saying she doesn't want to shortchange herself  out of an education. She wants to get a real education by doing her own work.

Now let's listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

She never cheats or plagiarizes. She's an original scriptwriter. I speak, of course, of our wonderful, Dr. Lucy Tse.
