<h1>Problem C</h1>
<h1>FLYING TO FREDERICTON</h1>
</center>

<p>After being inspired by Salvador Dali's artwork, Brett decided he would like to travel to 
Fredericton, New Brunswick to visit the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.</p>

<p>Brett lives in Calgary, and would like to find the cheapest flight or flights that would take
him to Fredericton. He knows that a direct flight from Calgary to Fredericton, if one exists,
would be absurdly expensive, so he is willing to tolerate a certain number of stopovers.
However, there are multiple airlines in Canada with so many different flights between 
different cities now, which makes it very difficult for Brett to find the least expensive way to
Fredericton! Can you write a program to help Brett plan his route?</p>

<p align=center><img src=p11280.png></p>

<p align=center><em>Map showing a sample of the flights that would take Brett to Fredericton.</em></p>

<p>You will be given a list of cities between and including Calgary and Fredericton. The cities
will be given in order of "nearest" to "farthest". The first city will always be "Calgary" and
the last "Fredericton".</p>

<p>You will also be given a list of flights between pairs of cities, and the associated cost for each
flight, taxes included. There will never be a flight from a farther city to a nearer city -
Brett has already discarded those flights, deeming them to be a waste of time and money.
Bear in mind, however, that there may be more than one flight between any two cities, as
Brett is considering flights from all airlines.</p>

<p>Finally, you are presented with a number of queries. Each query is a single integer indicating
the maximum number of stopovers Brett will tolerate. For each query, your program must
calculate the least total cost of flights that would take Brett from Calgary to Fredericton
with no more than the requested number of stopovers.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single number indicating the number of scenarios to 
process. A blank line precedes each scenario.</p>

<p>Each scenario begins with a number N (2 &le; N &le; 100), the number of cities, followed by N
lines containing the names of the cities. A city name is a string of up to 20 uppercase and lowercase
 letters. Next is a number M (0 &le; M &le; 1000), the number of flights available, followed
by M lines describing the flights. Each flight is described by its departure city, its 
destination city, and an integer representing its cost in dollars. The final line starts with 
Q (1 &le; Q &le; 10), the number of queries, followed by Q numbers indicating 
the maximum number of stopovers.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each scenario, your program should output the scenario number, followed by the least
total cost of the flights for each query. Follow the format of the sample output. If no flights
can satisfy a query, write "No satisfactory flights". Output a blank line between scenarios.</p>
