This episode is about shock jocks.  These are peopl e on the radio who like to say surprising and unusual things.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

I like listening to the radio on my morning commute  each day.  This morning, though, my favorite DJs weren’t on the air. ………

Howard:  Do you know what happened to the Kelvin an d Ben show this morning?

Robin:  Kelvin and Ben are both on suspension.  The  FCC fined the radio station. Apparently, Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two weeks ago that the FCC found objectionable.

Howard:  That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are shock jo cks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.  They work in a bi g market producing a morning show with a lot of competition.  They have to push the envelope.

Robin:  That may be true, but the FCC said that the y went too far.  On Mother’s Day, they invited several mothers to be in-studio g uests for a segment.  They cursed them, said sexually explicit things, and cal led them obscene names.

Howard:  They did that?!

Robin:  I guess you weren’t listening that morning.

Howard:  No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!

This episode is about shock jocks.  We actually tal ked about shock jocks back on English Café number 144, but we thought we’d talk a  little more about it and some specific vocabulary that you might hear in rel ationship to shock jocks. What are shock jocks?  Well, basically they are peo ple who host a radio program, usually in the morning, and they attract i nterest – they get people to listen to them by saying very unusual things, perha ps expressing opinions that they know people will be offended by, people won’t like, people will be shocked by.  “To be shocked by (something)” means to be sur prised and perhaps angered at something.  The word “jock” comes from “jockey.”   A “disc jockey” – we usually just call them “DJs,” by their initials – are peopl e who host radio music programs who decide what songs are going to be played.  You can also have a DJ at a dance club; he or she is the person who is deciding  which songs are going to be listened to and danced to.  So, “DJ” means “disc jo ckey,” and the word “jock” in the expression “shock jock” comes from “jockey.”  A  “jockey,” you may also know, is the person who rides a horse in a race.  I ’m not sure why we call people who are on radio “disc jockeys” who play music, but  we do.

So, after that long introduction now let’s get to o ur actual story and dialogue.  It begins by me saying, “I like listening to the radio  on my morning commute each day.”  Your “commute” (commute) is the trip between  your home and where you work.  If you don’t work at home, if you work in an  office or a school, a hospital, wherever, then you have a commute; you have a trip between your home and your work and then back again.  “Commute” has a cou ple of meanings in English, however.  Be sure to take a look at our Le arning Guide for some of those.

I say that this morning my favorite DJs weren’t on the air.  We mentioned “DJ” means “disc jockey.”  “To be on the air” means to b e on the television or to be on the radio; you can hear them on the radio or you ca n see them on the television. But this morning, my favorite DJs weren’t on the ai r; they weren’t on the radio, in this case.  Instead, we hear a shock jock by the na me of Howard, and Howard begins by saying, “Do you know what happened to the  Kelvin and Ben show this morning?”  The Kelvin and Ben show, we must guess, is another radio program.

Robin, the other DJ, says, “Kelvin and Ben are both  on suspension.”  “To be on suspension” means that you are not allowed to do so mething, usually it’s because you did something wrong or they are investi gating the possibility that you did something wrong.  “To be suspended” or “on suspension” means to be temporarily – for a short time – not able to do you r job.  Robin says, “The FCC fined the radio station.”  “FCC” are the initials f or the Federal Communications

Commission.  This is the U.S. government agency res ponsible for regulating television, radio, and other types of broadcast com munication: the FCC.  The FCC fined the radio station.  “To fine” (fine) as a  verb means to charge a fee when you do something wrong.  So for example, if yo u go too fast on the freeway and the police officer catches you, he or she may g ive you a fine, money that you have to pay the government as punishment.  “Apparen tly,” Robin continues, “Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two wee ks ago that the FCC found objectionable.”  Something that is “objectionable” is something that other people might find very rude, very unpleasant, we might say  “offensive,” it makes them angry.

Howard says, “That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are sho ck jocks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.”  Something tha t is “provocative” is done in order to get a strong reaction from someone else.  It’s done in order to make other people feel very strong emotions.  “To be pro vocative” means to try to get the other person angry, although you could also use  this word in a sexual sense. “To be sexually provocative” would be, say, to dres s in a certain way that would cause other people to take a sexual interest in you .  But we’re not talking about that.  We’re talking about being provocative in the  sense of making people angry or have a strong emotion.

Howard says that these shock jocks work in a big ma rket.  A “big market” here does not refer to the supermarket or a place where you might buy milk and cheese.  Here, “market” refers to a group of people  who might want to buy your product or service.  So when you say it’s a “big ma rket,” you mean it’s a large group of people who might be interested in what you  are selling or what you have to offer.  Sometimes when we talk about television and radio, it refers to the area where these people live; so Los Angeles is a big ma rket, so is New York, so is Chicago.  These are large cities, and they have a l ot of people who live there, and who might be interested in listening to somethi ng or watching something. That’s what Howard means when he says that Kelvin a nd Ben work in a big market.  They produce a morning show with a lot of competition.  A “morning show” is just a radio or television program that’s on in the morning.  I think these are popular in most countries throughout the world.   When you’re driving and listening to the radio you have often two people wh o make jokes and think they’re very funny and play music; that’s a morning show.  Howard says that these shock jocks have to push the envelope.  The express ion “to push the envelope” (envelope) means to do something more than what was  expected, or to go beyond some sort of limit, to do something that has n’t been done before.

Robin says, “That may be true, but the FCC said tha t they went too far.”  They did too much of something.  “To go too far” means t o break the rules, to go

beyond what you should do, but to do something wron g.  It’s a negative thing. You’ve gone too far, you’ve been too extreme.  “On Mother’s Day,” Robin says, “they invited several mothers to be in-studio guest s for a segment.”  “In-studio” means the people were in the same room as the DJs.  Sometimes you will have DJs or television people interview someone who’s no t in the same room; they may be in a different city or they may be calling b y telephone from a different part of the country.  Well, these were guests – these we re people in the same room where they were recording the program.  A “segment”  is a part of a large show, a larger program.  So we talk about segments on our E nglish Café; the English Café is divided into different parts and we call th ose parts segments, or we could.

Robin says the shock jocks cursed the mothers.  “To  curse” (curse) means to use bad language, to swear, to be vulgar, to say bad wo rds.  The shock jocks also said sexually explicit things.  Something that is “ sexually explicit” is something that has a very obvious sexual meaning, usually use d in such a way to shock or provoke someone, to offend someone.  “Obscene” (obs cene) is similar; anything that is obscene is something that is not acceptable  by society.  Something that is obscene could be sexually explicit also, but it cou ld be just something that was very rude or offensive or disgusting, something tha t people don’t accept and don’t want to see or don’t want to listen to; that’ s obscene.  Sometimes we use this as an adjective to mean too much or extreme: “ The housing prices in Los Angeles are obscene.  You have to pay an obscene am ount of money.”  Well, we don’t mean anything sexual or even anything vulgar,  we just mean it’s way too much.  It’s so much that it can make you angry, eve n, that’s how much you have to pay for a house in Los Angeles – which is pretty  true actually!

Howard says, “They did that?!”  They did all of tho se terrible things?  Robin says, “I guess you weren’t listening that morning.”  Howa rd says, “No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!”  I’m really shocked.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I like listening to the radio on my morning commute  each day.  This morning, though, my favorite DJs weren’t on the air. ………

Howard:  Do you know what happened to the Kelvin an d Ben show this morning?

Robin:  Kelvin and Ben are both on suspension.  The  FCC fined the radio station. Apparently, Kelvin and Ben said some things on the air two weeks ago that the FCC found objectionable.

Howard:  That’s crazy!  Kelvin and Ben are shock jo cks.  They’re supposed to say things that are provocative.  They work in a bi g market producing a morning show with a lot of competition.  They have to push the envelope.

Howard:  No, I wasn’t.  Now I’m truly shocked!

[end of dialogue]

We hope our scripts are never objectionable, certai nly never obscene.  I don’t think they will ever be that way, because they’re w ritten by the wonderful writer, Dr. Lucy Tse.
