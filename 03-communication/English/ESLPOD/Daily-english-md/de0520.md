This podcast is a dialogue between a “receptionist” (som ebody who answers the phone at a business) and Asha.  It’s about giving someone “directions” (how to arrive at a certain place), as well as instructions on par king.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Receptionist:  So the meeting is set for 2:00 on Thursda y.  Do you know how to get to our offices?

Asha:  No, I don’t.  Could you give me directions?

Receptionist:  Certainly.  We’re located on Main Street .  The cross street is Udall. If you’re taking the freeway, the best exit to take is Uda ll East.  Once you’re on Udall, head east for about two miles and when you reach  the bend, veer right.  If you veer left, you’ll run into a dead end.  After you ve er right, you’ll be on Monroe Avenue and it’s a one-way street.  Our building is on the right-hand side, past the light.  If you pass Elm Street, you’ve gone too far.

Asha:  Okay, I think I’ve got all that.  Is there parking available?

Receptionist:  Unfortunately, there’s only street parking.   There is valet parking for the building next door, but they charge $12 and we  don’t validate.  There are meters on the street and on the side streets, but you ma y need to circle the block a few times to find an available meter.

Asha:  All right, and thanks for the information.  I g uess I need to leave early to have plenty of time to find the building and to find parking.

 Receptionist:  I tell everybody to count on getting lost  and having to hunt for parking.

Asha:  Thanks for the heads up!

Our dialogue begins with the “receptionist,” the perso n who answers the telephone at a business, saying to Asha, “The meeting is s et for 2:00 on Thursday.”  To say it is “set for” means it is planned for  2:00.  “Do you know how to get to our offices?”  Asha says, “No, I don’t.  Could you give me directions (can you give me instructions on how to get there)?”  “Directi ons” can mean instructions on how to do something, but when we’re tal king about location it’s instructions on how to arrive at a certain place.

Asha doesn’t know how to get to the building, so she asks f or directions.  The receptionist says, “Certainly (meaning yes, of course).  We’ re located on Main Street.  The cross street is Udall.”  A “cross street” is the closest street that intersects with the street that your home or office is on.   So, if you have your offices on Main Street and the street that runs perpen dicular – that crosses that street that is closest to you is Udall, that would be the cross street.  Udall is the cross street.  “If you’re taking the freeway, the best exit to take is Udall East.”  An “exit” on a freeway is where the cars can get off of the  freeway; it’s sometimes called the “off ramp.”  The “on ramp” is how you get o nto the freeway.

So the nearest or best exit is Udall East.  “Once you’re o n Udall, head east for about two miles.”  “Head,” here, is used as a verb: “to  head (somewhere).”  “To head (somewhere)” means to go in a particular direction , to travel in a specific direction, usually north, south, east, or west.  So, the receptionist tells her to “head east,” that means drive toward the east on Udall for about two miles and when you reach the bend, veer right.  “Bend” (bend) he re means a curve in the road.  When you have a road that suddenly starts to go in  a different direction, that’s called a “bend.”  Not necessarily 90 degrees, in fa ct, a bend is usually less than 90 degrees.  The word “bend” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English however, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some m ore explanations.

So, the receptionist tells her that when she reaches the bend she should veer (veer) right.  “To veer” means to change directions with out stopping, usually to go either right or left on the main road.  So in this ca se, the road has a bend in it, but it may also have a continuation – it may be continuing go ing straight and then part of the road, really another road, goes off in an other direction.  So, he’s telling

 her to veer right – go toward the right when she reach es the bend, not left.  If she veers left – if she goes left, in the opposite direction,  she’ll run into a dead end. “To run into (something)” means to encounter something,  to arrive somewhere where you weren’t expecting – something that you didn’t expect perhaps, or something that is a negative influence or an obstacle, som ething that prevents you from doing what you want to do.  In this case, you’l l run into a dead end.  A “dead end” is a street that ends with no connecting stree ts, so you would have to turn around and go out.

So the receptionist continues, “After you veer right, you’ ll be on Monroe Avenue and it’s a one-way street.”  A “one-way street” is a stree t where cars can only move in one direction, not in two directions like most st reets.  He says, “Our building is on the right-hand side, past the light.”  “Past” means beyond.  The “light,” here, means the traffic light; the “traffic l ight” is the box that has three lights: red, yellow, and green.  At least in the Unit ed States red means stop, green means go, and yellow means caution, usually between  the red and the green, when the light is “changing,” we would say.  So , when someone says it’s “past the light,” they mean you have to go past the tra ffic light and it is beyond it, it is farther than that.  He says, “If you pass Elm Street  (if you go past Elm Street), you’ve gone too far.”

Asha says, “Okay, I think I’ve got all that (I think I under stand all of that).  Is there parking available?”  The receptionist says, “Unfortunatel y, there’s only street parking.”  “Street parking” is when you have to park on t he street, not in a parking lot or in a parking garage.  He says, “There is valet par king for the building next door.”  “Valet parking” is when you have somebody who pa rks your car for you. So you drive up to the front of the building, you get out, you give your keys to someone (who we call a “valet”), and that person drives your car and parks it somewhere else so you don’t have to park it.  This is very popular here in Los Angeles; there are lots of restaurants that have valet p arking.  In fact, there’s even a grocery store here that has valet parking!  Of course , valet parking isn’t free normally, and you have to pay extra money.  In this ca se, the valet parking charge is 12 dollars, which is not unusual if it were a business, like a business building.

The receptionist says that we don’t validate.  Often wh en you go to a business that has valet parking you don’t have to pay because the b usiness will say that you are there for their purposes, and therefore they w ill pay your parking.  So you bring in your parking ticket – little piece of paper th ey give you with the time that you entered, and they’ll put a little stamp on it, the y’ll put a mark on the ticket to show that they will pay for it.  That’s to “validate.”  But unfortunately, the receptionist says they don’t validate for the valet parking  for the building next

 door – the building next to theirs.  The receptionist says, “There are meters on the street and on the side streets.”  A “meter” is a mach ine that you put money into, usually coins, to buy a certain amount of time so yo u can park there.  So, “parking meters” are very common, especially in busy places.  You have to pay usually a dollar, maybe two dollars an hour to park in a  particular place.  Parking meters are usually on the street, but you can also find so me public parking meters in “parking lots,” in separate areas just for par king cars.  The receptionist says that there are meters on the street – the street wh ere the building is located, and on the side streets.  A “side street” is a street that  is connected to a main or larger street.  So you may have a big street, and then yo u have small streets that are near it; those smaller streets are called “side street s.”  Often side streets are places where houses are located, but not always.

The receptionist says that you may need to circle the blo ck a few times to find an available meter.  “To circle (something)” means to go ar ound something.  “To circle the block” means to go around the streets that are  surrounding a certain building.  You have to turn right and then go down t he street, and then turn right again and go down that street, and then turn right a gain, go down that street, and turn right again and go down that street – you’re circl ing the block.  The “block” is the space that is like a square; the streets go on all four sides.

Asha says, “All right, and thanks for the information.  I  guess I need to leave early to have plenty of time (to have enough time) to find t he building and to find parking.”  The receptionist says, “I tell everybody to count on getting lost.”  “To count on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to assume o r believe that something will happen, to depend on or rely on somethi ng.  “Count” has several different meanings in English however, so take a look a t our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that word.

The receptionist says that he tells everybody to count on getting lost, meaning you’re probably going to get lost, so you should give your self extra time.  You should also count on having to hunt for parking.  “To hu nt” means to search, or to look for in this case.  “To hunt for parking” means to ha ve to look for a place to park your car, because it’s so crowded in that area.  Asha s ays, “Thanks for the heads up!” meaning thanks for the warning.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
