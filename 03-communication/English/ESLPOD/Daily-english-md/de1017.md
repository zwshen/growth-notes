This episode is a dialogue between Claudia and Jae about driving a different kind of vehicle – a different kind of automobile or truc k. It’s called an “off-road vehicle.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: When you invited me to go for a drive, this wasn’t what I pictured.

Jae: You’re about to have the ride of your life. Ge t in and I’ll strap you in.

Claudia: What is this thing?

Jae: It’s an off-road vehicle. Haven’t you seen one  before? It has four-wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.

Claudia: When you say “any terrain,” what exactly d o you mean?

Jae: With this baby, we can drive on sand, gravel, mud, and even snow.

Claudia: You mean you intend to take me driving on sand and gravel?

Jae: Yeah, just wait until we start spinning and sk idding. You’re going to love it. You’d better put on this crash helmet – just in cas e.

Claudia: I was picturing a drive in the country.

Jae: But this is much more exciting, right?

Claudia: I don’t know . . .

 Jae: Come on. If you’re lucky, I’ll take you muddin g next weekend.

Claudia: Whoopee.

[end of dialogue] Claudia begins by saying to Jae, “When you invited me to go for a drive, this wasn’t what I pictured.” “To go for a drive” usuall y means to go in your car and drive somewhere that’s pleasant, somewhere that wil l help you enjoy the area through which you are driving. “To go for a drive” often means that you’re not going to one particular destination – you’re just k ind of going out in your car and enjoying driving your car in some, perhaps, nice ar ea of your town or near where you live.

Jae has invited Claudia to go for a drive, but Clau dia says that it isn’t what she pictured. “To picture” (picture) as a verb means to  imagine how something will be, to think about how something will look or will appear. Claudia had a certain expectation, a certain idea about what going for a drive would look like, and it doesn’t look like what is actually happening. Jae s ays, “You’re about to have the ride of your life.” A “ride” (ride) is, in this cas e, when you drive in the car or you go in some sort of vehicle.

The word “vehicle” (vehicle) refers to a car, or a truck, or a motorcycle, or perhaps even something like you would find on a far m – a tractor. “Vehicles” are things that move other things, including those of u s who are in the vehicle. When you go somewhere in a vehicle, you could say that y ou’re going on a ride. Jae tells Claudia that this will be “the ride of your l ife.” “The ride of your life” would be the greatest ride you have ever had.

Anything that is the “something of your life” is the best possible experience of that thing. If you talk about the “vacation of your life ,” you’re talking about the best vacation that you have ever taken. Jae says to Clau dia, “Get in,” meaning get in the car – or get in, in this case, the off-road veh icle – “and I’ll strap you in.” “To strap (strap) someone in” is to put something over a person so that the person doesn’t move in case there is a problem with the ve hicle.

For example, in a car you have to put on what’s cal led your “seat belt” here in the United States in most states. You must be wearing a  seatbelt. It’s like a belt, but it doesn’t go around your waist to hold up your pan ts. It goes across your body and connects to the seat of the car so that if ther e is an accident, you are going to be protected somewhat; instead of flying out of the window of the car, you will stay in the seat of the car.

 That’s what we’re talking about here. Jae is going to strap Claudia in. He’s going to put on seatbelts so that she doesn’t fly out of the car in case there is a problem. Claudia says, “What is this thing?” Jae sa ys, “It’s an off-road vehicle.” An “off-road vehicle” is usually a car, truck, or m otorcycle that is designed to drive through an area that doesn’t have any roads, that doesn’t have any streets.

An off-road vehicle could be used, for example, in the desert, or it could be used out in the country, away from the city, where there  aren’t any roads. Anything that is designed to ride through an area or go through a n area without streets or roads is called an “off-road vehicle.” “Off-road” m eaning, of course, that it is not on the road – because there are no roads, perhaps.

Jae says, “Haven’t you seen one before? It has four -wheel drive and can travel on any terrain.” “Four-wheel drive” is a feature of  a car that allows it to use all four wheels in order to move forward. The motor act ually is connected to all four wheels in such a way that it gives the car more pow er, or the vehicle more power. “Terrain” (terrain) refers to the kind of la nd or the surface on the land.

Claudia says, ‘“When you say any terrain, what exac tly do you mean?” Jae says, “With this baby, we can drive on sand, gravel, mud,  and even snow.” The term “baby” here doesn’t refer to a young child who has just been born. It refers to, informally, the vehicle. When people use the term “ baby” in this way, they’re using it informally to talk about usually a thing, a piece of equipment.

You could talk, for example, about your phone. If y ou have an iPhone or a smartphone, an Android phone, you might say, “You k now, with this baby, I can text, and I can check the Internet, and I can talk to people.” “Baby” here refers to a cool, powerful piece of equipment or object that you have. That’s what Jae is saying here when he says, “baby.” He says, “With th is baby,” meaning with this vehicle, “we can drive on sand, gravel, mud, and ev en snow.”

“Sand” (sand) is what you would find in a desert, o r on a beach by the ocean, or by a lake. “Gravel” (gravel) are many small rocks that are often used for areas where you can walk or drive where there is no forma l road. Gravel is sometimes used when there is a road but it doesn’t have any c oncrete or asphalt – it’s not a smooth road.

When I was growing up in the country in Minnesota, in the areas outside of the city there were lots of gravel roads, and you would  have these little rocks on the road, and the rocks were what you drove over. You d idn’t have a regular street like you have in the city. So, “gravel” is a materi al – the small little rocks – that is

put on the road or some path that you travel on. “M ud” (mud) is basically wet dirt. So, an off-road vehicle can travel on all these dif ferent kinds of surfaces.

Claudia says to Jae, “You mean you intend to take m e driving on sand and gravel?” She’s asking Jae if his plan is to take he r driving on sand and gravel. Jae says, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “Just wait until we start spinning and skidding. You’re going to love it.” “To spin” (spin) means to  move in circles, often when you don’t have complete control over your movement, alt hough that’s not always the case. You could spin around on your legs. You could  take your body and turn it 360 degrees. That would be to spin your body like a  ballet dancer.

A car can also spin, and it can spin around in a ci rcle, especially if it’s on a surface that isn’t very stable – like ice, for exam ple. “To skid” (skid) means to have your vehicle move in such a way that you’re no t controlling it completely. It’s moving in a direction that you don’t want it to mov e, perhaps because the surface that you are driving on is slippery like ice, or th at you are going too fast and you are trying to turn your car or vehicle. That could also cause it to skid.

Usually when a car skids, there are marks on the ro ad – what we call “skid marks” – and these are caused by the rubber of the tires on the vehicle. If you see someone stop suddenly, you’ll often hear a high  noise, a high-pitched sound, and if you look on the street, you’ll see black lin es. These are skid marks from the tires of the car.

Jae says, “You’d better put on this crash helmet, j ust in case.” A “crash helmet” is something you wear over your head, like a motorcycl ist would wear, to protect your head in case you fall out of the vehicle and h it your head. Claudia says, “I was picturing a drive in the country.” She’s saying  she thought that they were going to go on a nice, pleasant drive in a car thro ugh an area close to the city. Jae says, “But this is much more exciting, right?” Claudia says, “I don’t know.”

Jae says, “Come on. If you’re lucky, I’ll take you mudding next weekend.” Jae is trying to encourage Claudia to go with him. He says  if she is lucky – if she has good luck, if she is fortunate – Jae will take her mudding. “To go mudding” (mudding) is to drive your vehicle in an area that has a lot of mud in it. Some people think this is fun. I don’t know why, but it apparently is popular in certain places in the country. People take their cars or tr ucks or motorcycles, and they drive in the mud. I know it’s weird – Claudia think s it’s weird, too.

She says at the end of the dialogue, “Whoopee.” “Wh oopee” (whoopee) is an expression we use normally to show how excited you are about something. However, it’s often used as it is here, “sarcastica lly,” meaning you’re trying to

make a joke. It’s not meant to be serious. You’re b eing funny. You are in fact saying the opposite – that this is not going to be exciting, that you are not excited about this particular activity. Claudia is clearly not excited to go mudding, and I don’t blame her.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
