This episode has a dialogue between George and Mart ha about taking care of your teeth.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Martha:  Oh, I have a toothache!   

George:  It sounds like you’re in for a visit to th e dentist. 

Martha:  That would be the last resort.  I hate goi ng to the dentist.  I don’t like needles and the sound of the drill scares me to dea th.  I’m hoping the toothache will just go away.   

George:  You really should get that checked out.  D o you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist? 

Martha:  No, thanks.  I haven’t seen a dentist in y ears and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice. 

George:  Years?!  You haven’t been to a dentist in years?  Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care?  You’re supposed to get a  dental cleaning twice a year. 

Martha:  I don’t follow doctor and dentist guidelin es like that.  I brush my teeth every day.  That’s good enough. 

George:  No, it’s not.  You should be flossing ever y day and rinsing your mouth with mouthwash to keep your teeth and gums healthy.   If you haven’t been to the dentist in years, I’m not surprised you didn’t know  that.  

 Martha:  Stop preaching!  I’ll go to the dentist wh en I need to. 

George:  Like now. 

Martha:  Maybe.  It doesn’t hurt that much anymore…  

George:  I never knew you were such a chicken. 

Martha:  [makes a chicken noise] Bwauk, bwauk…!

Martha begins our dialogue by saying, “Oh, I have a  toothache!”  A “toothache” (toothache – one word) is when you have a pain in y our tooth.  Your “teeth,” which is the plural of “tooth,” are, of course, the se white things inside your mouth that you use to eat.  Martha has a toothache.  You can have a toothache, you can have a headache, you can have a stomachache, de pending on what part of your body hurts. 

George says, “It sounds like (it seems to me) you’r e in for a visit to the dentist.” “To be in for (something)” means you’re going to ha ve to do something very soon.  Often we use that expression when we’re talk ing about something that isn’t very nice, something isn’t very pleasant.  We  might even say, “You’re in for a big surprise.”  That usually means you don’t unders tand something bad that is going to happen to you.  A “dentist” (dentist) is a  person who works on – a doctor who works on your teeth, a medical doctor who takes  care of or specializes in taking care of teeth. 

Martha says going to the doctor would be the last r esort.  The expression “the last resort” (resort) means it’s the last option yo u will choose, only after you do everything else, it’s the one that you don’t want t o do and will only do because nothing else works.  Perhaps it’s very expensive, p erhaps it’s just very unpleasant or even embarrassing.  Martha says, “I h ate going to the dentist.  I don’t like needles.”  “Needles” are sharp objects t hey stick into your body to put drugs into them, usually.  Martha doesn’t like the sound of the drill; she says, “the sound of the drill scares me to death,” makes me ve ry frightened.  A “drill” (drill) here refers to a machine that makes holes in someth ing.  You can use a drill to make a hole in your wall if you are putting somethi ng on your wall.  Well, dentists use drills to make holes in your teeth in order to repair them.  “Drill” actually has a couple of different meanings; those can be found in  – where else? – our Learning  

Guide.  Martha says, “I’m hoping the toothache will  just go away,” meaning it will disappear, I will no longer have it.   

George says, “You really should get that checked ou t.”  When someone says you need to have something “checked out” they mean exam ined or reviewed, especially by someone who’s an expert in that area:  “My foot is hurting me.” “You should really a podiatrist (a foot doctor) che ck that out.”  “To check out” has some other meanings in English; you can say, “I’m g oing to check out that movie.”  That means I’m going to watch it or I’m go ing to read about it or investigate it.  Or, “Check out this guy walking do wn the street.”  There it means simply look at this guy.  There’s actually, uh, eve n more meanings of this two- word phrasal verb, “to check out.”  You can use it to refer to taking a book out of the library: “I’m going to check out a book.”  But here, it refers having someone who’s an expert examine or look at something.  Geor ge says, “Do you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist?”  A n “appointment” is a particular day and time that you are going to see s omeone.  It’s like a date, but when we talk about business things or going to a do ctor or dentist, having an appointment is the time and day you are going to se e that person. 

Martha says, “No, thanks.  I haven’t seen a dentist  in years and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice.”  She hasn’t gone to t he dentist in many years, and she isn’t going to go unless she has to, unless she  has no other option or choice. George is surprised; he says, “Years?!”  He’s surpr ised that Martha hasn’t been to a dentist in years.  “You haven’t been to a dent ist in years?  Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care?”  “To prevent” (prevent) means to make sure something does not happen.  “Preventive,” then, is an adjective.  “Care,” here, is like a medical treatment or some action that you do  so that you are healthy. “Preventative care” are things that you do so that you don’t get sick.  So, you should wash your hands with soap and water after us ing the bathroom, and before eating with your hands to prevent you from g etting sick later.  That’s preventative care.   

Martha apparently, we guess, doesn’t believe in pre ventative care.  George says, “You’re supposed to get a dental cleaning twice a y ear.”  The word “dental” refers to your teeth.  “Dental cleaning,” then, is a proce ss where you go and have your teeth cleaned usually by someone who works with the  dentist, not actually the dentist.  Usually the person who cleans your teeth is called a “dental hygienist.” This is sort of like the dentist’s assistant that c leans your teeth and makes sure that you don’t have any problems with your teeth. 

Martha says, “I don’t follow doctor and dentist gui delines like that.”  I don’t follow the rules that doctors and dentists give me, she’s saying.  “I brush my teeth every  

day.  That’s good enough.”  That’s sufficient.  “To  brush (brush) your teeth” means to take a small, little tool, really, that yo u put something on called “toothpaste.”  The tool is called a “brush” or a “t oothbrush” and you put it in your mouth and you move it back and forth to clean your teeth.  Or, you get one of those machines, where it moves for you.  I like tho se; I have one of those.  I forget what they’re called…Sonicare or something li ke that. 

Anyway, Martha says she brushes her teeth every day  and that should be enough.  George says, “No, it’s not.”  It’s not suf ficient; it’s not enough; it’s not good enough.  “You should be flossing every day.”  “To floss” (floss) is to take a small piece of string and put it in between each of  your teeth to remove any food that is stuck there – that is still there, because if it stays there it could eventually cause what is called a “cavity” (cavity).  A “cavit y” is like a hole in your tooth that the dentist then has to fill or fix.  George says t hat Martha should be flossing every day and rinsing her mouth.  “To rinse” (rinse ) means to put some liquid in your mouth, like something like water, and move the  liquid back and forth, and then usually you spit the liquid out again.  The sp ecific liquid you would use here would be mouthwash.  “Mouthwash” is a special kind of liquid that is supposed to help keep your teeth healthy.  He says that if you rinse your mouth with mouthwash it will keep your teeth and gums healthy.   “Gums” (gums) is what your teeth are stuck into in your mouth.  It’s the area of the skin on the inside of your mouth that holds your teeth in your mouth.  “G um” has a couple of different meanings in English however; take a look at the Lea rning Guide for some more of those.   

George says, “If you haven’t been to a dentist in y ears, I’m not surprised you didn’t know that.”  Martha says to George, “Stop pr eaching!”  “To preach” (preach) in this context means to give someone else  advice that they don’t want, usually in such a way that you are bothering them o r you are acting as if you were better than them.  “To preach” can also be a v erb used in a religious sense, something that a minister or a rabbi or a priest mi ght do.  But here, it means to give advice that someone doesn’t want.  Martha says , “Stop preaching!  I’ll go to the dentist when I need to.”  George says, “Like no w,” meaning you need to go now.  Martha says, “Maybe.  It doesn’t hurt that mu ch anymore…”  George said, “I never knew you were such a chicken.”  A “chicken ” is an animal that you can eat.  But, “chicken” here is used to describe someo ne who is scared of doing something, who is afraid, someone who is what we wo uld call a “coward” (coward), someone who is not brave.  George says, “ I never knew you were such a chicken,” that you were so afraid.  Martha makes a chicken noise that we would make in English, “Bwauk, bwauk, bwauk!”  She’s sayi ng, of course, that yes, she is a chicken. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
