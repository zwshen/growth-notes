This episode is called “Handling (or taking care of) a Traffic Stop,” when the police stop you in your car because you’ve done something wrong.  Let’s get started.  > I was having a great day until I saw the police car behind me with its loud siren and lights flashing.  I pulled off the road and waited for the officer to approach my car.  Officer:  May I see your driver’s license, proof of insurance, and car registration, please?  Lindsay:  Let me get them out of my glove compartment.  Here they are.  What did I do wrong, officer?  Officer:  Didn’t you see that stop sign back there?  Lindsay:  Stop sign?  What stop sign?  I didn’t see any stop sign.  Officer:  Sit tight and I’ll be right back. …  I guess he was running my driver’s license and license plate numbers to make sure there are no outstanding warrants for me or for my car.  He came back after a few minutes. …  Officer:  You ran a stop sign back there and I’m going to have to give you a citation.
