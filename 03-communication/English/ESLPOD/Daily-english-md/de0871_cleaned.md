This episode is a dialog between Anastasia and Josh ua, about going somewhere to listen to a specific kind of dance music. Let’s get this party started.  

[start of dialog] 

Anastasia:  This is the best club in the city.  Gra ce brought me here last month. You’re going to love it. 

Joshua:  What?! 

Anastasia:  You’re going to love this club.  It has  the best DJ in town. She spins the best mixes. 

Joshua:  Did you say you’re going to get us some mi xed drinks? 

Anastasia:  No, I said that this DJ is great.  She plays music that gets people pumped up.  Oh, I love this song. It samples from t wo of my favorite songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.  

Joshua:  Did you say that you want to buy this CD? 

Anastasia:  No, I said I like this song.  It’s got a pounding beat and I can really feel the music. I love dancing to it.  Do you want to get out onto the dance floor? 

Joshua:  Let’s wait until she segues into something  mellower.  I don’t really like dancing to this kind of club music.   

Anastasia:  What?!  You love club music?  That’s gr eat.  Let’s go dance! 

Joshua:  I think I’ll sit this one out.  Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here? 

Anastasia:  What?!  You want the music to be louder ?  I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up. 

Joshua:  No! 

[end of dialog] 

Anastasia begins by saying to Joshua, “This is the best club in the city.” A “club” (club) in this case refers to a dance club, a build ing with a large open area where people can dance and listen to music – usually mode rn music that is easy to dance to or, at least, some people think it’s easy to dance to. I do not.  

Anastasia says, “Grace brought me here last month. You’re going to love it.” Joshua, however, is having difficulty hearing Anast asia because it’s so loud in the dance club. This, of course, is quite common. T hey play their music very loud and it’s very difficult to talk to someone. So, Jos hua says, “What?” because he didn’t hear Anastasia. Anastasia repeats herself. S he says, “You’re going to love this club. It has the best DJ in town.”  

A “DJ” is a disc jockey. That’s the person who deci ded which songs are going to be played and in what order. You’ll often find a DJ  on a radio station or at a dance club like this. Anastasia says the DJ “spins the best mixes.” “To spin” (spin) here means specifically to play recorded mus ic, to be a DJ in a club. “Spin” can also mean to move something around in a circula r way and of course, in the old days, when we used to play these vinyl things c alled “records,” they would spin around in a circle. Even your CD’s, your compa ct discs, did that. Now, with MP3’s and other kinds of digital music, nothing has  to spin around physically, but we still use this verb “spin.”  

This DJ, according to Anastasia, spins the best mix es. A “mix” (mix) is when you take two or more songs and you combine them togethe r so that it’s almost like one song. Joshua says, “Did you say you’re going to  get us some mixed drinks?” “Mixed (mixed) drinks” have nothing to do with mixe s like recorded songs. A “mixed drink” is a drink with alcohol and some othe r liquid like juice, coffee, or cream. Often it has a sweet taste, though not alway s. It’s a kind of alcoholic drink that you would find in a dance club for adults like  this.  

Anastasia says, “No. I said that this DJ is great.”  In other words, Joshua isn’t understanding what Anastasia is saying. He thought she said something about  

getting mixed drinks, when in fact, she was talking  about spinning mixes. Anastasia says the DJ plays music that gets people pumped up. “To be pumped (pumped) up” means to be excited, to be enthusiasti c, to be ready to do something.  

Pump up the jam, pump it up…  

That’s a line from a dance song from, I don’t know,  many years ago. “Pump up the jam.” “The jam” is probably just the music ther e – the mix.  

Pump up the jam, pump it up…  

That’s what dance music is like. You can tell why I ’m not a very good dancer. Anyway, Anastasia says, “The music gets people pump ed up.” “Oh I love this song,” she says. “It samples from two of my favorit e songs and it’s my favorite track on this CD.” “To sample” (sample) here means to take a small part of a song and create a new song with it. So, it’s simila r to a mix but usually, when you’re sampling, you’re just taking a very small pa rt, maybe just ten seconds or so from another song and making it part of a new so ng. That’s what sampling involves. Sampling usually has a new song that is c ombined with an older song or part of an older song.  

This particular song that Anastasia loves is one of  her favorite songs. “It’s my favorite track in this CD.” We talk about one song on a compact disc or one song on an old record album as being a “track.” We also use the term now for MP3’s on iTunes, for example. You can have a track. A “tr ack” (track) is one song.  

Joshua says, “Did you say that you want to buy this  CD?” Notice again, Joshua is just not understanding what Anastasia is saying bec ause it’s so loud in that particular place. Anastasia says, “No. I said I lik e this song. It’s got a pounding beat and I can really feel the music. I love dancin g to it.” A “pounding beat” is a very strong rhythm in a song, especially for dancin g. If you go to a dance club, that’s pretty much all you can hear. It’s that poun ding beat that people use in order to dance to help them dance, I guess. It’s pr obably a combination of the alcohol and the pounding beat that gets them to dan ce.  

Anastasia says to Joshua, “Do you want to get out o nto the dance floor?” “To get out onto” means to go, in this case, to a place whe re you can dance. The “dance floor” is part of the area in the dance club where everyone goes to dance. They, of course, also have tables in the dance club, for people to sit and drink and try to talk to beautiful women who don’t want to talk to y ou.  

Joshua says, “Let’s wait until she” – the DJ – “seg ues into something mellower.” “To segue” (segue) means to transition or move from  one thing to another, very smoothly, without any breaks or any pauses. It’s so rt of a more formal word. You wouldn’t expect it to be used in a dance club, but there it is. The DJ is going to segue into something, Joshua hopes, that is more me llow, that is “mellower” (mellower). Something that is mellower is something  that is calmer, that is more relaxing, that is not quite as exciting or loud.  

Joshua says, “I don’t really like dancing to this k ind of club music.” We talked about a dance club as a place where you can go to d ance, or simply a club. “Club music,” then, is the kind of music you typica lly hear at a dance club. It’s usually very loud. It is often what we call “electr onic music.” All of the music is made by machines and computers rather than, say, an  actual piano or a drum.  

Anastasia says, “What? You love club music?” Of cou rse she didn’t hear what Joshua said. “That’s great. Let’s go dance.” So, th e two of them aren’t communicating because of the loud noise. Joshua the n says, “I think I’ll sit this one out.” “To sit something out” means not to parti cipate in something, at least, not participating right away, maybe wait a little w hile for the next opportunity. So, there’s a song on and you don’t really like it and you don’t want to dance to it. You may say to your boyfriend or girlfriend or dog,  if you bring your dog to the dance club, as I do, “Let’s sit this one out. I don ’t want to dance to this song. We’ll dance to the next one.” And your dog goes, “W oof, woof!” (I’m crazy, I know.) 

Joshua says, “Don’t you think that the volume is a little loud in here?” The “volume” (volume) is how loud something is or how q uiet it is. That’s the volume. Anastasia says, “What? You want the music to be lou der?” She again doesn’t understand Joshua and thinks Joshua wants the music  to be even louder than it is now. She says, “I’ll go ask the DJ to turn it up .” “To turn something up” means to increase the level of something, especially when  we’re talking about volume – on a television or on a radio. It could also be tal king about temperature. “I’m going to turn up the heater.” I’m going to make the  heater give us more heat so it’s warmer in here. Joshua, at the end, simply say s, “No!” meaning, no, he doesn’t want the music to be louder. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.

She doesn’t normally spin mixes in a dance club, I don’t think. But she does write wonderful scripts. I speak of our wonderful scriptw riter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
