This episode is a dialogue between the beautiful Sh erin and an apartment manager about some problems she’s having in her apa rtment. Let's get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Apartment Manager:  This is the one-bedroom apartme nt we have for rent. Let me show you around. 

Sherin:  Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a m ouse or a rat. 

Apartment Manager:  There aren’t any rodents or any  other vermin in this apartment complex. I make sure of that. 

Sherin:  Are you sure? 

Apartment Manager:  Sure, I’m sure. Only last month , I bought some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all. This comple x is rodent-free. 

Sherin:  Oh, I see. 

Apartment Manager:  And the month before that, we h ad roaches, ticks, and fleas, but I fumigated and they’re gone. 

Sherin:  You called a pest control company? 

Apartment Manager:  I didn’t need a pest control co mpany to get rid of a few bugs. I did it myself. 

Sherin:  Oh, okay. 

Apartment Manager:  And six months ago, we had bedb ugs, but thanks to my diligence, they’re gone, too. So you want to see th is apartment or don’t you? 

Sherin:  I think I’ll pass. This conversation is ma king my skin crawl.

Our dialogue begins with the apartment manager sayi ng to Sherin, “This is the one-bedroom apartment we have for rent.” It's an ap artment with one bedroom. You can find one-bedroom apartments, two-bedroom ap artments, three-bedroom apartments, and so forth. The apartment manager say s, “Let me show you around.” Let me show you the apartment. 

Sherin stops and says, “Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a mouse or a rat.” It looked like a “mouse” (mouse) or a “rat” (rat). A m ouse is a small animal. It could be white. It could be black. It could be gray. It h as fur hair on it. It has a long tail and a pointed nose. If you’ve ever seen any Disney movies, you know who Mickey Mouse is. Well, Mickey Mouse doesn’t really look exactly like a real mouse, but you get the idea. That’s a mouse. By the  way, there's a famous song about Mickey Mouse that was used for a television s how back in the oh, ‘60s and ‘70s and ‘80s that spelled Mickey Mouse’s name: [si nging] M-I-C…See you later! K-E-Y…Why? Because we love you M-O-U-S-E, Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse… and so on. Aren't you glad you know that now? Sheri n sees a mouse and a rat. A rat is a little bigger than a mouse – a little long er tail on it. 

The apartment manager says, “There aren’t any roden ts or any other vermin in this apartment complex.” He says, “Oh, no, no. Ther e aren't any rodents here!” A “rodent” (rodent) is a general category that would include mice (which is the plural of mouse) and rats. “Vermin” (vermin) is a g eneral term describing any small animal or insect that people don’t like usual ly because they cause damage or they might be carrying some disease, so vermin i s a general term for any little animal or insect you don’t like. You don’t hear tha t word a lot anymore. The “apartment complex” is the building or buildings wh ere you find apartments. So the apartment manager says, “Oh no, we don’t have a ny rodents here.” 

Sherin says, “Are you sure?” The apartment manager says, “Sure, I’m sure.” Yes, I am sure. “Only last month,” he says, “I boug ht some mousetraps and rat poison and got rid of them all.” So last month, he bought a mousetrap. A “mousetrap” (mousetrap), one word, is a little devi ce, a little machine we use to catch a mouse and hold it so that we can kill it or  get rid of it. Any sort of trap for  

an animal is intended to capture them, to get them,  and hold them so you can get rid of them. “Rat poison” is a chemical substance t hat will kill rats. It’ll probably also kill humans, too! To “get rid of something” me ans to no longer have it, to eliminate it, to throw it away: “I'm going to get r id of all of my old Mickey Mouse comic books.” Actually, I don’t have any Mickey Mou se comic books, but it's just an example. I do have a Mickey Mouse song. Would yo u like to hear that? No? Okay. 

So the apartment manager says, “This complex is rod ent-free.” When we say something as rodent-free or drug-free or comedy-fre e, we mean it doesn’t have those things. “Rodent-free” means there's no animal  here – there are no animals, no rodents. “Drug-free” means there are no drugs. “ Comedy-free” would be – it's not very funny, kind of like this episode. Sherin s ays, “Oh, I see.” I understand. 

The apartment manager then says, “And the month bef ore that, we had roaches, ticks, and fleas, but I fumigated and they're gone. ” So the apartment manager is saying no, we don’t have any of these problems here  because I killed them all. I used to have these problems. Now, two months ago, h e says, they had roaches, ticks, and fleas. A “roach” (roach) is also called a “cockroach” (cockroach), one word. A cockroach is a large insect that you will o ften find in warm, humid places. “Humid” means there's water in the air. They often are found in places that are dirty and have a lot of little pieces of food. That ’s a cockroach or a roach. 

A “tick” (tick), when we're talking about an insect , is a very small insect that typically bites your skin and kind of goes into you r skin and starts to suck your blood out, kind of like a vampire but not exactly. A tick can be found in many different environments. We used to have ticks when I was back in Minnesota where there are a lot of trees, a lot of “wooded ar eas,” we would say, forests – you will find ticks that will fall onto your skin a nd then bite your skin and begin to suck your blood out - kind of like my old girlfrien d. 

So the apartment manager says, “We don’t have any r oaches, ticks or fleas.” A “flea” (flea) is a small insect that can't fly, but  it does live on the skin of animals and of people. Dogs often have fleas. The apartment  manager says that he doesn’t have any of those things because he fumigat ed. To “fumigate” (fumigate) means to fill a room or an area with a dangerous ga s that kills insects and kills little animals. Usually when you do this, you have to take the people out, too, and then fumigate. 

Sherin says, “You called a pest control company?” A  “pest” (pest) is another word for kind of like vermin, things that are small  animals that bother you. “Pest  

control” would be a business that goes into a house  or a building and kills the insects, kills the animals, the vermin we might say , that are there. 

The apartment manager says, “I didn’t need a pest c ontrol company to get rid of a few bugs, a few insects. I did it myself.” Sherin  says, “Oh, okay.” The apartment manager then says, “And six months ago, we had bedb ugs.” “Bedbugs” (bedbugs), one word, are little insects that live o n people’s bodies and are often found in mattresses, what you sleep on. They can be  found in carpets and in clothing and, like a tick, they also suck the blood  out of your body. So the manager says that they had bedbugs, but thanks to h is diligence, they're gone, too. “Diligence” (diligence) is careful, thorough, persistent work. Being very careful with something, going back and checking it everyday – that would be diligence. The apartment manager says he was very d iligent and now they don’t have any bedbugs. Then he asked Sherin, “So, you wa nt to see this apartment or don’t you?” 

He’s asking her if she still wants to see the apart ment and she says perhaps wisely, intelligently, “I think I'll pass.” To “pas s.” as a verb. means to choose not to do something or to have something. Someone says,  “Oh, would you like a piece of apple pie or a piece of chocolate cake?” a nd you're on a diet, you're trying to lose weight. You say, “No, thank you, I'l l pass.” I'll not have it. Sherin says, “This conversation is making my skin crawl.” To make your skin “crawl” (crawl) means to be nervous, to be frightened, to b e anxious, perhaps even to be a little sick or disgusted by something, something that is very unpleasant and obviously talking about all these different bugs an d rodents makes Sherin’s skin crawl. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Apartment Manager:  This is the one-bedroom apartme nt we have for rent. Let me show you around. 

Sherin:  Wait! Did you see that? It looked like a m ouse or a rat.
