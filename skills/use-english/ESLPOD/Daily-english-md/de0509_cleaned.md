This episode is called “Going on a Cruise.”  It’s an epi sode that has a dialogue between Connie and Robert using vocabulary you would u se if you went on a big ship going on a vacation, which is what a cruise is.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Connie:  I’m so excited!  We’re finally taking a cruise.  Are you sure this is the embarkation area?   

Robert:  Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here, se e?  Come on, let’s find our cabin. 

Connie:  Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possi ble and look around the entire ship.  Do you think they’ll let us go on the  bridge and meet the captain? 

Robert:  I don’t think so.  You know, I think we’re go ing the wrong way.  I can’t find our cabin number.   

Connie:  Let’s see if we can find the purser or a stewa rd to help us.  Oh, never mind, here it is!  Wow, this cabin is really small. 

Robert:  No worries.  We won’t be spending much time i n the cabin.  When do we eat?   

Connie:  We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch, and I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.   

Robert:  Whoa, what’s that?!   

 Connie:  That’s the ship setting sail.  You’re not goin g to be seasick, are you? 

Robert:  I don’t think so, but I’m really looking forwa rd to our first port of call! 

[end of dialogue] 

Connie begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m so excited!  We ’re finally taking a cruise,” a vacation where you eat, sleep and are enterta ined in a very large ship. Here in Los Angeles, you can take a cruise down to Mexico,  you can take a cruise up to Alaska, you can take a cruise to South America or to Hawaii; all of these are places where you can go on a cruise.  I’ve been on a cruise once, it was the worst experience of my life as a vacation.  But, he y, doesn’t mean you will have a bad time!  Connie says, “Are you sure this is the embarkation area?” “Embarkation” is when you get on the ship; it’s the pro cess of getting on the ship when you first get to the ship.  You park your car, or you get out of your taxi, and then you walk onto the ship; that’s the embarkation. 

Robert says, “Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here , see?”  “To go on board” means to be on the ship, or it could mean on a boat, but here it means the big cruise ship.  Robert says, “Come on, let’s find our cabin. ”  Your “cabin” is your little room (and I do mean little room – small, very small) where you sleep. 

Connie says, “Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as po ssible.”  “To go on deck” means to be on top of the ship.  It’s a large, fla t top of the ship.  There’s nothing above you in other words – there’s no roof, no  ceiling.  By the way, “cabin” has a couple of different meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word a nd our next word, which is “bridge.”  Connie says she wants to look around the entir e ship and asks, “Do you think they’ll let us go on the bridge and meet the captain?”  On a large ship, the “bridge” is the highest part of the ship, usually, w here people are, and these are the people who control the ship; they control its spe ed and direction.  That’s where you would find the captain.  So, the captain is o n the bridge; notice we don’t say “in the bridge,” we say “on the bridge.”  The  “captain” is, of course, the leader of the people who work on the ship – the person  who is in charge, who’s the boss. 

Robert says, “I don’t think so,” I don’t think we can meet  the captain.  “You know,” he says, “I think we’re going the wrong way.  I can’t fin d our cabin number.” Connie says, “Let’s see if we can find the purser or a ste ward to help us.”  On a ship – on a cruise ship, the “purser” (purser) is the per son who works on the ship and whose job it is to help you have a good time and to  make you more comfortable.  Usually, the purser is assigned a certain num ber of cabins.  In other  

 words, they’re responsible for everyone in, say, these 20 ca bins.  The “steward” is the person who brings food and drink to people in t heir cabins.  On American cruise ships, you usually can eat as much as you want; they have buffet lunches, dinners, and breakfast.  On many cruise ships you can also o rder food; you can have food delivered to your little room (your cabin) fo r free.  It’s not good food, but they definitely deliver it!   

So Connie says, “Oh, never mind, here it is!” meaning s he’s found their cabin. “Never mind” means what I said before isn’t important o r is no longer important, don’t worry about it.  She doesn’t need to find the p urser and the steward in other words, because she found her cabin.  And what does she say when she sees her cabin?  “Wow, this cabin is really small.”  She should have  asked me, I could have told her! 

Robert says, “No worries.”  The expression “no worries” ha s become popular a lot in the last 10-15 years in the United States.  It means no problem, there is nothing to worry about, or simply don’t worry about it.   Robert says, “We won’t be spending much time in the cabin (we won’t be here very much).  When do we eat?”  That’s a good question, because that’s pretty much  all you do on a cruise ship.  You eat and eat and eat, and watch other peopl e eat!   

Connie says, “We can go down to the buffet right now fo r lunch.”  The “buffet” is, you may know, a style of eating where you have a long tab le and you put all the food on the table, and everyone comes and takes as much foo d as they want typically.  Connie says, “I put us down for the main seatin g at 7:00 for dinner.” Because there are so many people on a cruise ship, they assi gn you (or give you) a time when you can come and eat, if you are goin g to eat in the dinning room, in the main area where people eat.   

Connie says she put her and her husband down for the mai n seating at 7:00 for dinner.  “To put them down” means to sign them up, od dly enough it means the same.  “To put us down” means to write our name down o r to say that’s when we want to do something.  Or if you’re volunteering for something, you would put your name on a list for example.  The expression “put me  down” can also used when, for example, someone is selling something to you an d you need to order it, and then they’ll go and get it.  You might use this exp ression, for example, if my niece is selling cookies for her Girl Scout troop (group of girls that get together and – I don’t know what they do).  Anyway, you would say p erhaps, “Put me down for three boxes of mints,” a type of chocolate cookie .  But here, Connie means that she simply signed them up, or wrote their nam e down, for the main seating.  “Seating,” here, means the time that you go into a restaurant and sit down to eat.  As I said before, on a cruise ship they have  different times –  

 different seatings for each meal because there are too  many people on the ship for everyone to fit; there’s no room in the dining ro om for everyone at the same time. 

Robert says, “Whoa, what’s that?!”  “Whoa” means I’m surp rised; I’m, perhaps, scared.  Connie says, “That’s the ship setting sail.”  “To set sail” is for a boat to leave the land and go out into the water.  Connie says,  “You’re not going to be seasick, are you?”  “To be seasick” is a type of motion sickness when you are on the water in a ship; you feel nauseous, your stomach doesn ’t feel good, you feel dizzy, and so forth.  Some people take special pills to pr event them from being seasick.  I got seasick when I went on a cruise, even though I took the pills.  So, doesn’t help me – but I’m sure you’ll have a good time ! 

Robert says, “I don’t think so (I don’t think I’m getting  seasick), but,” he says, “I’m really looking forward to our first port of call!”  You r “port of call” is a place where the cruise ship stops, usually for a short period, but it could be overnight or more. It allows you to get off the ship and to visit the place where it is stopped, and then you go back on the ship, and then you go somewhere else.  If you take a cruise ship around the Mediterranean, the sea between Africa and Europe, you could go to many different ports of call – many different pla ces you could stop and visit. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Connie:  I’m so excited!  We’re finally taking a cruise.  Are you sure this is the embarkation area?   

Robert:  Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here, se e?  Come on, let’s find our cabin. 

Connie:  Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possi ble and look around the entire ship.  Do you think they’ll let us go up on the bridge and meet the captain? 

Robert:  I don’t think so.  You know, I think we’re go ing the wrong way.  I can’t find our cabin number.   

Connie:  Let’s see if we can find the purser or a stewa rd to help us.  Oh, never mind, here it is!  Wow, this cabin is really small.
