This episode is a dialog between Robert and Staci a bout getting a massage, when someone touches you physically in order to rel ax your muscles. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Robert:  Why are you twisting your back like that?   

Staci:  I’m in pain.  My back and shoulders really hurt.  I think it’s from sitting at this computer all the time. 

Robert:  What you need is a good massage.  It can g et rid of the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief. 

Staci:  I don’t know.  I don’t like the idea of get ting naked in front of a stranger. 

Robert:  If you’re skittish about that, remember th at you’ll be covered with a sheet, except for the part that he or she is workin g on.  It’s not a big deal. 

Staci:  But what if they’re too rough with me?  It might make things worse. 

Robert:  An experienced massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t like wha t he or she is doing. 

Staci:  Do you think a massage could really help me ? 

Robert:  Definitely.  I recommend my massage therap ist.  She’s licensed and very good. 

Staci:  She doesn’t use smelly oils or play hokey m usic during the massage, does she? 

Robert:  No, she doesn’t.  She’s very professional,  without being too clinical, if you know what I mean.  Call her! 

Staci:  I’ll think about it – ouch!    

Robert:  Call her right now.  You don’t have a minu te to lose! 

[end of dialog] Our dialog begins with Robert asking Staci, “Why ar e you twisting your back like that?” “To twist” (twist) means to turn something, to move part of something in one direction while the other thing is in a differe nt direction. “To twist your back” – the back of your body – would mean to move the top of your body, for example, in one direction, to the left, while the rest of yo ur body remains straight. That would be to “twist your back.” Staci says, “I’m in pain” – I hurt – “my back and shoulders really hurt. I think it’s from sitting at  this computer all the time.” Staci is sitting at her computer all day and she says it is causing pain in her back.  

Robert says, “What you need is a good massage.” A “ massage” (massage) is where someone touches your skin and your muscles in  order to relax you. Robert says a massage can “get rid of the knots in your mu scles and get you some pain relief” or give you some pain relief. “Knots” (knot s) in this case refer to tight sections in your muscles that are causing you pain,  usually because you’re very tense, you’re very stressed. You have a lot of thin gs you are worried about, perhaps. That could cause knots in your muscles, pa in that can best be relieved by massaging the knots, by taking your hand or some one else taking their hand and trying to get those out of your muscles by putt ing pressure on them, by rubbing them. Your muscles, you probably know, are the parts of your body that help move your bones back and forth. “Pain relief” (relief) is a reduction or a lessening in the amount of pain, the amount that so mething hurts you. Robert says, “A good massage can get rid of” – meaning can  eliminate – “the knots in your muscles and get you some pain relief.”  

Staci says, “I don’t know. I don’t like the idea of  getting naked in front of a stranger.” “To be naked” (naked) is to be without a ny clothes on. I am usually not naked when I record these episodes. I’m just kiddin g. I’m never naked when I’m recording these episodes. “To be naked in front of a stranger” means that you have no clothes on and you are in front of someone you do not know. That’s what a “stranger” is.  

Well, Staci doesn’t want to get naked in front of a  stranger. The reason she says that is because typically, when you get a body mass age, you go somewhere and you have to take your clothes off. If you don’t tak e your clothes off, the person giving the massage has no way of easily touching yo ur skin in order to relax your muscles.  

Robert says, “If you’re skittish about that, rememb er that you’ll be covered with a sheet.” “To be skittish” (skittish) means to be ner vous about something, to be uncomfortable about something. Heather is very skit tish about going to see a doctor because she doesn’t like the sight of blood.  She doesn’t like looking at blood, that red stuff that comes out of your body i f you put a hole in your skin. Robert says to Staci, “If you’re skittish about get ting naked in front of a stranger, remember that you’ll be covered with a sheet.” A “s heet” is a piece of cloth that you put normally on top of a bed. When you are slee ping on it, you put sheets on it so that you’re not sleeping directly on the actu al bed. You have this piece of cloth, this piece of fabric, that you sleep on that  you can take off and wash easily.  

When you get a massage, you’re typically covered wi th a cloth, a towel or a sheet that covers your body, except the part where the person giving you the massage is working. Robert says, “It’s not a big de al,” meaning it’s nothing you should be worried about. Staci says, “But what if t hey’re too rough with me? It might make things worse.” “To be rough” (rough) mea ns to use too much pressure, to be too strong in the movements, not to  be gentle, not to be “tender,” we might say. Staci says that she’s worried about t he person giving the massage being too rough with her. She says, “It might make things worse.”  

Robert says, “An experienced massage therapist will  ask you the amount of pressure you want and you can speak up if you don’t  like what he or she is doing.” A “massage therapist” (therapist) is a pers on whose job it is to provide massages, to give you a massage. In many places, ma ssage therapists have to get a license from the government in order to work.  Robert says “The massage therapist will ask you the amount of pressure you w ant.” “Pressure” (pressure) is how strong they will press against your body with t heir hands, basically.  

Robert says, “You can speak up if you don’t like wh at he or she” – the massage therapist – “is doing.” “To speak up” is a two-word  phrasal verb meaning to say something to the person who is in charge when you’r e not happy with something, when you don’t like something, when you want to cha nge something. A teacher might tell her students, “If you have any problems with your homework, you need to speak up – you need to say something so that I k now.”  

Staci says, “Do you think a massage could really he lp me?” Robert says “Definitely. I recommend my massage therapist.” Rob ert has his own massage therapist that he is suggesting that Staci use as w ell. Robert says, “She’s licensed and very good.” “Licensed” means that she has a license (license), which is official permission, usually from the gove rnment, that allows you to say that you’re a massage therapist, in this case, and work as one in that particular area. Robert says that his massage therapist is lic ensed.  

Staci says, “She doesn’t use smelly oils or play ho key music during the massage, does she?” “Oil” (oil) is a thick liquid that massa ge therapist will sometimes put on your body in order to make it easier to rub your  muscles. “Smelly” (smelly) is something that has a not very pleasant smell or odo r, something that stinks, something that has a bad smell. Staci is worried th at the massage therapist will use oils that are smelly, that don’t have a good sm ell to them. She’s also worried that the therapist will play hokey music. “Hokey” ( hokey) is something that is, we might say, overly emotional or sentimental, somethi ng that has too much emotion in it. In this case, it would be music that’s suppo sed to relax you but you might think is kind of silly or kind of stupid. Sometimes  massage therapists try to relax the people that they are working on by playing musi c but if it’s silly music, if it’s hokey music, you may not like it. That’s what Staci  is afraid of here. 

Robert says, “No she doesn’t. She’s very profession al, without being too clinical, if you know what I mean.” “To be clinical” (clinica l) would be almost like a doctor, someone who only uses evidence and science to do wh at they’re doing. Robert is saying that the massage therapist is not too cli nical, meaning she’s not like a doctor, in this case. She’s going to help you relax . “If you know what I mean,” is an expression that we use or a phrase that we use t o mean the other person probably understands what you’re trying to say even  though you haven’t explained it very well.  

Robert says, “Call her.” Staci says, “I’ll think ab out it. Ouch!” “Ouch” (ouch) is the sound we make when something hurts us, when we’re i n pain.  We say “Ouch!” Sometimes you would say other words as well when yo u’re in pain. Robert says, “Call her right now. You don’t have a minute to los e.” The expression “You don’t have a minute to lose” means that you have to do so mething immediately, right away. If you don’t, then your situation will be muc h worse.  

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
