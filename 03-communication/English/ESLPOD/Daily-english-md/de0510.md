This episode is a story about someone taking a shower or a bath.  When your body is dirty, you have to clean it, and that’s what we’r e going to do in this episode.  Let’s get started. > I spent the day helping my friend, Babbit, on his farm.   When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  I headed straight for the shower.
> I ran the water, closed the shower curtain, and adjusted  the showerhead.  I worked the soap into a lather and scrubbed from head to  toe.  I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Yo u still stink!  You need to soak in a bath!”
> I went back into the bathroom, put the stopper in the bathtub, and turned on the faucet.  I didn’t want to take any chances.  I took some of  my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub.  When the bath was r eady, I got in.  I soaked for a half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wo w, you smell as pretty as a flower!”  That wasn’t exactly what I was going for, but I’d rather smell like flowers than pigs!

 Our story begins with me saying that I spent the day help ing my friend, Babbit, on his farm.  A “farm” is a place where you may have animals,  you may be growing food in the ground; it’s a place outside of the city, u sually.  When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  The verb “to stink” is an inform al way of saying that someone smells bad, they have an unpleasant smell or an unpleasant odor. “Odor” (odor) is the same as smell.  So, when someone d oesn’t smell very good because they’re dirty, you could say, “You stink.”  However, it’s a very strong thing to say; it’s a very negative thing to say, so you woul d not want to say that to anyone that you didn’t know very well.  We also use the v erb “to stink” to mean to be poor at something, to not be very good at something .  I could say, “I stink at chess,” meaning I’m not a very good chess player.

But in this case, when my wife says that I stink, she means I  smell bad, so I headed straight for the shower.  “To head for (somethi ng)” is to go in the direction of.  When I say I headed straight for the shower, I me an I went directly to the shower; I didn’t do anything else first.  That’s the mea ning of the word “straight” here.  A “shower” is the part of the bathroom where you stand under water to get clean; you stand up and the water goes over you to clean you.  I say that I ran the water.  “To run the water” means to turn the wa ter on and, usually, wait until the water gets warm enough.  So, “to run the water” means to turn the water on. I ran the water, and then I closed the shower curtain.   The “shower curtain” is a large piece of plastic that hangs around the shower, sepa rates the shower from the rest of the bathroom to prevent the water from g oing outside.  Some showers have doors, and you slide the door back and forth, often  made of glass.  Other showers have a shower curtain.  A curtain is also a word w e use to describe things that you put over your windows to keep the light  out; those are also curtains, when they’re made of some kind of material – so me kind of fabric.  I also adjusted the showerhead.  The “showerhead” is the piece of metal that the water comes out of in a shower.  It’s attached to a pipe  in the wall where the water comes from, and it’s what sprays the water over you –  that is, it distributes the water over you.  That’s the showerhead.

I said that I worked the soap into a lather.  “To work the soap” means I did something to the soap; in this case, I put the soap on my skin and I moved it back and forth – I rubbed it until it was in the form of lather.  “Lather” (lather) is when you have a lot of soap bubbles on your skin so that it looks white.  Or for example, you could put soap on your hands, and if you move them together very quickly you will work the soap into a lather.

I “scrubbed” (meaning I rubbed very hard in order to ge t clean) from head to toe. The expression “from head to toe” means from the top of  your body where your head is to the bottom of your body where your foot and toe are.  Your toes, of

 course, are the five little digits that come out of your  foot.  Then, I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.  “To rinse (something)” means to pour water on it to, usually, get rid of the soap that you are using to clean something.  “To rinse off” means the same; we use “off” here for emphasis.  It’s very common in English to add a preposition like “off” after a verb to give it the idea of motion – of action.  In this case, to rinse off means to put the water on me so that the soap (that solid or liquid substance that you use to clean something) goes of f of my body.  So, I rinsed off the soap and I toweled off.  “To towel off ” means to take something to dry your body, what we call a “towel,” which is a big pi ece of fabric – of material that you use to dry something with.  “To towel off” is the same as “to dry off,” to take something and remove water from something else; in this case, from my body.

When I went back into the living room after showering, my wife said, “You still stink!”  In other words, I did not get rid of all of the bad smell.  She says, “You need to soak in a bath!”  “To soak” (soak), here, mean s to be covered in water for a long period of time, usually we do that to make some thing easier to clean.  So if you are cooking and you have a pan that is very dirty, you m ay put water on it – or water in it and let the pan soak – use the water to  help make the pan easier to clean.  So maybe an hour later, you would come back and then clean the pan. Well here, we’re talking about soaking your body because it’s so dirty, and so you get into what we call a “bathtub,” which is a larg e, usually rectangular container in the bathroom that you can sit in or lie d own in and put water over you.

I went back into the bathroom then and put the stopper  in the bathtub.  The “stopper” is a small piece of metal or plastic that you p ut in the hole that is at the bottom of the bathtub or of a sink so that water can’t flow out; the water stays in the bathtub or the sink.  If you want to take a bath, yo u have to put a stopper there so that you have water inside the bathtub.  I tur ned on the faucet after that. The “faucet” (faucet) is a long, metal piece that is a bove the sink or bathtub that the water comes out of.  So, “to turn on the faucet” means to allow the water to come out and fill up the bathtub.  I said, “I didn’t want to take any chances,” I wanted to be sure I was going to be clean.  So, I took some of my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub.  “Bubble bath”  is a liquid that smells nice that women sometimes, or children, put in their bath to make  them smell nice.  It’s not something that a man would normally do, but because I w as so dirty I wanted to make sure I smelled good.

When the bath was ready, then I got in.  I soaked for a  half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.  The expression “nook (nook) and cra nny (cranny)” means small places, but here, when we say “I washed every no ok and cranny,”

 we mean you did a hundred percent of everything; you clea ned everything.  You might say, “I was looking for my car keys, because I lost them .  I looked in every nook and cranny of my house,” meaning I looked everywhere.   So here, we’re saying that I cleaned every part of my body.

When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wo w, you smell as pretty as a flower!”  I say that that wasn’t exactly what I was go ing for.  “To go for,” in this case, means what I wanted, what I intended, what I  was trying to make happen.  I wasn’t trying to smell pretty, I was just trying not to smell bad.  “To go” plus a preposition is a very common expression in English; ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that, as w ell as the verb – or the word “soak.”  I said, “I’d rather smell like flowers tha n pigs!”  Remember, I was working on a farm, and so one of the animals that you h ave on a farm is a pig, which people think tends to smell badly.

Now that I’m all clean and smelling like a flower, let ’s listen to the dialogue again at a normal speed. > I spent the day helping my friend, Babbit, on his farm.   When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  I headed straight for the shower.
> I ran the water, closed the shower curtain, and adjusted  the showerhead.  I worked the soap into a lather and scrubbed from head to  toe.  I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Yo u still stink!  You need to soak in a bath!”
