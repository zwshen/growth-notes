This episode is a dialogue about how to spend money . Sounds like fun. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ezra: Wait a minute. What happened to the $500 in o ur joint account? 

Charlotte: I probably paid bills with it. You know that our paychecks barely cover our monthly expenses. 

Ezra: I know, but I was counting on that $500 to pa y for new tires for my car. 

Charlotte: Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it, if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it for s ome new shoes.  

Ezra: Forget it. The tires are a necessity and your  shoes are not. We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spe nding for nonessentials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category. 

Charlotte: You don’t need to spend $500 for a set o f new tires. You just want to splash the cash for some fancy ones. 

Ezra: Let’s stop arguing about who gets to spend th e money and first figure out what happened to it. According to this, the money w as withdrawn from our account for automatic contributions to our retireme nt accounts. 

Charlotte: Our what? 

Ezra: Our retirement accounts. Remember last month we decided to start saving money for retirement? 

Charlotte: Whose harebrained idea was that? Do you think we can get the money back? 

Ezra: I’m not sure, but if we can, I have dibs! 

[end of dialogue] 

Ezra begins our dialogue by saying to Charlotte, “W ait a minute,” meaning stop. “What happened to the $500 in our joint account?” A  “joint (joint) account” is a bank account that two or more people share, which m eans that either person, if it’s a two-person account, can spend money from tha t bank account – or “withdraw money,” we would say.  

Charlotte says, “I probably paid bills with it.” Ch arlotte says that she “probably paid bills” (bills) with this $500. “Bills” refer t o obligations that you have to give other people money. You may have a “telephone bill. ” The telephone company may send you a “bill” in the mail, a piece of paper  telling you how much money you have to pay them for your telephone service.  

Charlotte says, “You know that our paychecks barely  cover our monthly expenses.” Your “paycheck” (paycheck) is money you get from your job every week or two weeks, perhaps every month, in exchange  for working at your job. The verb “to cover” here refers to the ability to p ay for something, to have enough money to pay for something. You have to have enough  money “to cover your rent” – that is, to pay for your rent.  

If we say something “barely (barely) covers” your “ expenses,” what you have to pay to live, we mean you have enough but just enoug h. You may need $100 and you have $101. So, you barely have enough money. Th e money you have “barely covers” your monthly expenses. Again, “expe nses” just refers to money that you have to spend in order to live or in order  to do a certain thing.  

Ezra says, “I know, but I was counting on that $500  to pay for new tires for my car.” Ezra understands that the paychecks that he a nd Charlotte get barely cover their monthly expenses, but he was “depending on,” or relying on – he says “counting on” – the $500 to buy new tires for his c ar. Charlotte says, “Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it” – meaning the way I see things, or in my opinion – “if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it  

for some new shoes.” A “balance” (balance) refers t o an amount of money that is in, in this case, your bank account.  

Charlotte is saying that if they have extra money i n their bank account, she has “dibs (dibs) on it.” “To have dibs on” something is  to have the right to have or to do something before another person. It’s a somewhat  informal expression often used in families, especially among children. Childr en will say, “I have dibs on that seat on the couch.” In other words, I am the person  who gets to use that seat on the couch before anyone else. Another way of using this word “dibs” is “to call dibs.” “I called dibs on the last piece of cake.” I n other words, that’s mine. No one else can have it.  

Charlotte says she has dibs on any extra money in t heir bank account so she can buy some new shoes. Ezra disagrees. He says, “Forge t it. The tires are a necessity and your shoes are not.” A “necessity” is  something you need, something that is necessary or required. He says, “ We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spending for nonesse ntials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category.”  

Ezra and Charlotte give themselves each $150 every month for “discretionary (discretionary) spending.” Spending that is “discre tionary” is something that you control and that is not affected by any other rules  or obligations. “Nonessentials” refers to things that are not essential. Something that is “essential” is something that is “necessary.” “Essential” and “necessity” he re are related. “Nonessentials” are things that are not required, not necessary.  

Ezra is saying that new shoes are “nonessentials.” He says they “fall into the category of nonessentials.” “To fall into” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning that it has the characteristics of a particular group or  a particularly category. That’s why he says it “falls into” that category. It is to  be classified or it is to be described as being, in this case, nonessential. Cha rlotte says, “You don’t need to spend $500 for a set of new tires.” You don’t need to spend five hundred dollars for four new tires, Charlotte is saying. “You just want to splash the cash for some fancy,” or nice, “ones.”  

The expression “to splash (splash) the cash (cash)”  means to spend money on something that causes other people to notice you, e specially when you’re buying things that are expensive but aren’t necessary. It’ s an informal expression, “to splash the cash.” If you go out and buy a new Merce des-Benz or a new BMW car or a new Rolls Royce even if you don’t need one – a nd after all, who really needs that expensive of a car – we might say that you are  “splashing the cash.”  

Perhaps you want to try to get a new girlfriend or perhaps you want your neighbors to think that you are very rich.  

Ezra says, “Let’s stop arguing about who gets to sp end the money and first figure out,” or determine, “what happened to it” – what ha ppened to the $500. “According to this” – and we imagine that Ezra is l ooking at their bank statement, a piece of paper describing everything that happene d in their bank account last month – “the money was withdrawn from our account f or automatic contributions to our retirement accounts.” “Withdrawn” comes from  the verb “to withdraw,” which means to take out of something.  

When we’re talking about money and bank accounts, w e refer to “depositing money” – putting money in – and “withdrawing money, ” taking money out. The money was withdrawn from Ezra and Charlotte’s accou nt for “automatic contributions.” Something that is “automatic” (auto matic) is something that happens without you having to do anything or take a ny action yourself. A “contribution” is when you give money or something else to someone or to something.  

In this case, we’re talking about putting money, or  we would use the verb “contributing” money, to a “retirement account.” “R etirement” (retirement) describes what happens after you stop working, usua lly after the age of, say, 65 or 67. That’s called “retirement.” You are no longe r working. But of course you still need money, and in the United States many peo ple have what are called “retirement accounts” that you put money into while  you are still working.  

That money is then, we hope, invested in stocks or bonds or some other sort of financial instrument that allows you to make even m ore money with your money, so that when you stop working, you have money to li ve on. Yes, the government gives you money through a system we call “Social Se curity,” but often it isn’t very much.  

So, this $500 that Charlotte and Ezra are talking a bout was actually taken or withdrawn from their account and put into their ret irement accounts. In many companies, this happens automatically. You decide h ow much money you want to put into your retirement account, and every mont h the company takes part of your paycheck and puts it into a retirement account . That’s what happens here at CED.  

Charlotte says, “Our what?” She seems confused. Ezr a says, “Our retirement accounts. Remember last month we decided to start s aving money for retirement?” Charlotte says, “Who’s harebrained ide a was that?” “Harebrained”  

(harebrained) means stupid, foolish, something that  was done without thinking about it very carefully. Charlotte is saying that h aving a retirement account is a “harebrained” idea.  

She says, “Do you think we can get the money back?”  She’s asking if you can then get that money back from your retirement accou nt. By the way, the answer to that is usually no. The retirement accounts are often protected for tax reasons, and so you can’t just put money in and take it out whenever you want. You have to wait until you reach a certain age.  

Charlotte wants to get the money back, however. Ezr a says, “I’m not sure,” meaning I’m not sure if we can get the money back, “but if we can, I have dibs!” Notice once again the use of that word “dibs,” mean ing Ezra gets to use the money if they can get it out of their retirement ac count – which as I mentioned, they probably can’t.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ezra: Wait a minute. What happened to the $500 in o ur joint account? 

Charlotte: I probably paid bills with it. You know that our paychecks barely cover our monthly expenses. 

Ezra: I know, but I was counting on that $500 to pa y for new tires for my car. 

Charlotte: Do you really need new tires right now? The way I look at it, if there’s any balance in our account, I have dibs on it for s ome new shoes.  

Ezra: Forget it. The tires are a necessity and your  shoes are not. We’re each supposed to have $150 a month for discretionary spe nding for nonessentials, and new shoes definitely falls into that category. 

Charlotte: You don’t need to spend $500 for a set o f new tires. You just want to splash the cash for some fancy ones. 

Ezra: Let’s stop arguing about who gets to spend th e money and first figure out what happened to it. According to this, the money w as withdrawn from our account for automatic contributions to our retireme nt accounts.
