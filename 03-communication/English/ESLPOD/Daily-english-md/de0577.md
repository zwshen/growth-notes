This episode is a dialogue between Patricia and Sergio about magic, about people doing tricks that make you think that they have specia l powers.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia:  This is the best magic show I’ve ever seen.  Have  you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life?  They’re blowing m y mind!

Sergio:  They’re all just illusions.  It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  We’ve seen  some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seemed to do the impossible.

Sergio:  Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection?   While you weren’t looking, the magician left through the trap door.

Patricia:  Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but how do you explain the mind reader?  How did he know what I was thinking if he coul dn’t really read my mind?

Sergio:  I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers claim to have have been debunked by somebody.  Maybe he use d the power of suggestion.  Who knows?

Patricia:  And maybe you’re just jaded.

Sergio:  And maybe you’re the most gullible person who ever lived!

Patricia says to Sergio, “This is the best magic show I’ve eve r seen.”  A “magic show” is a type of entertainment where there is a perfo rmer, what we call a “magician,” who appears to do things that are impossible .  Patricia says, “Have you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life?”  A “magic trick” is something that this magician does that appears impossible.   For example, perhaps there’s a woman in a box, and they separate the  box, and you think that the woman has been cut into two pieces.  But of course, she hasn’t – or has she? Patricia says these magic tricks are blowing her mind.  “To blow one’s mind” means to make someone feel very surprised or excited or impr essed: “I heard her play the violin last night at the concert and it bl ew my mind.  She was amazing.”

Sergio says, “They’re all just illusions.”  An “illusion” i s something that appears different than how it actually is.  You think you’re seei ng one thing, but really you’re seeing something else.  Sergio says, “It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.” “It’s nothing but” means all that it is is smoke and mirr ors.  The expression “smoke and mirrors” (mirrors), it’s also sometimes “blue smoke and mirrors” or just “smoke and mirrors,” they both mean the same, which i s that you are distracting people to focus their attention on somethin g else or somewhere else, so they think that what is going on is magic, but it’s just  an illusion.  “Smoke and mirrors” or “blue smoke and mirrors” is a distraction.

Patricia says, “I don’t know how you can say that.  We’ve see n some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seeme d to do the impossible.”  A “sleight (sleight) of hand trick” is when  your hands move very quickly, and you can’t really see what’s going on.  Magician s often have sleight of hand tricks.  More generally, the expression is sometimes use d simply to mean an illusion, a trick, something that isn’t really true bu t it looks true.  An “escape artist” is a magician – a performer, who is able to get  out of very difficult situations.  For example, the great American magician H oudini, who is probably the most famous magician in U.S. history, was known to be  a great escape artist. You could put him in a box, and put him into the ocean , and somehow he would get out the box.  Of course, these things were always pla nned, but they made it look like it was the impossible being done.

Sergio says, “Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection ?”  “Misdirection” is distracting someone, making him or her focus on something else so while they’re looking over there, you’re doing something over here.  Then they look back, and it looks like you did something amazing or impossible, but in fact, you were just

 doing it so they couldn’t see it.  That’s misdirection, to  direct someone to the wrong place.  Sergio says, “While you weren’t looking, t he magician left through the trap (trap) door.”  A “trap door” is actually in t he floor, but you can’t see it; you don’t know it’s there.  Usually it is underneath like a p iece of carpet or a rug, and when you’re not looking someone can go down through the  trap door and it looks as though they simply escaped, but you couldn’t see how the y did it.  That’s a trap door.

Patricia says, “Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but h ow do you explain the mind reader?”  Your “mind” is what you think with.  A  “reader” is someone who can tell, in this case, what’s in your mind.  So, a “min d reader” would be someone who can say, “I know what you’re thinking.  Another word for a mind reader would be a psychic.  A “psychic” is a person who that says he or she has the power to know what other people are thinking, or even  to know what will happen in the future.  The expression “mind reader” is someti mes used in a discussion or an argument, especially between for example a husband an d a wife.  The wife will say, “Why didn’t you go to the store and buy me some flowers?” and husband will say, “Well, I didn’t think you liked flowers.  I’m n ot a mind reader.”  I can’t tell what you are thinking – I can’t see your thoughts.  And t hen the man sleeps in the living room that night – that’s usually what happen s!

Patricia says, “How did he know what I was thinking if he  couldn’t really read my mind?”  Patricia thinks that this mind reader – this mag ician was actually reading her mind, actually knew which she was thinking.  Sergio says,  “I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers clai m to have have been debunked by somebody.”  “Supernatural” is something that  is beyond the natural, beyond the normal, above what normal human beings can d o.  “Supernatural power” would be the ability to do something that woul d otherwise be impossible. Sergio says, “I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicia ns and entertainers claim to have (say they have) have been debunked by somebody.”   “To debunk” (debunk) means to prove that something is not true, to prove that something did not happen the way you thought it happened.  Sergio i s saying that these supernatural powers that these magicians say they have are  not really supernatural powers, that someone has shown how they do t heir tricks.  Sergio says, “Maybe he used the power of suggestion.”  “The powe r of suggestion” is when you give someone an idea – a thought, and make th em think that it was their idea to begin with so they believe it.

Patricia says, “And maybe you’re just jaded.”  “To be jad ed” (jaded) means that you have experienced something too much so that you’re no longer interested in

 it, or you no longer become excited by it.  It’s definit ely a negative expression, a negative way of describing someone to say that they’re jade d.

Sergio says, “And maybe you’re the most gullible person wh o ever lived!”  “To be gullible” (gullible) means to believe everything that o ther people say and do.  It’s, again, a negative adjective; it means that you are easily fooled, that you believe other people when you should not.  Sergio, then, is in sulting Patricia by calling her gullible.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
