Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, and to win a million dollars – really!  No, not really.  This episode is a dialogue between Carin and Hwan, it’s about a child who does not want to go to school, a very common scenario – a very common situation.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Carin:  We’re going to be late for school.  Hurry up!  Hwan:  I’m not going to school today.  I’m sick.  Carin:  You’re not sick.  You’re playing hooky.  You’re not going to put one over on Mom.  She’ll know you’re faking.  Get up!  Let’s go!  Hwan:  No, she won’t, and why are you giving me such a hard time?  It’s not like you’ve never played hooky before.    Carin:  I may cut class now and then, but I have a foolproof way of doing it so I don’t get caught.    Hwan:  You mean you forge notes from Mom to let you get out of class for doctor’s appointments and things like that.  I know all about that.  Carin:  Who told you?  Hwan:  I keep my eyes and ears open.  I pick things up.    Carin:  If you know so much, then you should know that pretending to be sick never works.  Mom will make you go to school anyway.  There are better ways to get an excused absence.
