Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,286 – Experiencing Headaches. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,286. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

This episode is a dialogue between Lupe and Eiji ab out having a headache. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lupe: Why are you lying on the couch with the light s out? Oh, you poor thing. Do you have a headache? 

Eiji: Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.  

Lupe: Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always  helps me when I have a pounding headache. 

Eiji: No, I just want to lie here quietly. 

Lupe: I know that when I have a tension headache, i t always eases the pain when someone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that? 

Eiji: No, I don’t think it’s a tension headache. It  came on suddenly. 

Lupe: Then it’s not a sinus headache either? Are yo u feeling pain around your cheekbones? 

Eiji: No, it’s not a sinus headache. I feel a littl e nauseous actually. 

Lupe: Ah, then it must be a migraine. That explains  the dark room and the need for quiet. I know the perfect cure for a migraine.  

Eiji: Me, too, but I don’t have it here. 

Lupe: I’d be happy to get it for you. 

Eiji: Great. The only place that stocks it is in th e next town.  

 Lupe: But that’s over two hours away. 

Eiji: If it’s too much trouble . . . 

Lupe: No, no, I’ll go. But how will you manage whil e I’m gone? 

Eiji: I’ll just have to find a way to muddle throug h.

The word “ache” (ache) means pain. So, a “headache”  is a pain that you have in your head, of course. Our dialogue is all about hea daches. Lupe begins by asking Eiji, “Why are you lying on the couch with t he lights out?” “To lie” (lie) means to put your body in what we would call a hori zontal position. When you sleep on a bed, you lie on the bed. Your body is no t standing up. It’s, we would say, “lying (lying) down.” Notice the spelling chan ges when it is turned into a participle (or “-ing”) form. 

Eiji is lying on a “couch” or a “sofa” – a big thin g that two or more people can sit in. He has the “lights out,” meaning he’s turned th e lights off in the room so that it’s dark. Lupe says, “Oh, you poor thing.” The phr ase “poor thing” is used to show sympathy or pity for another person who is in a bad or difficult situation. When you feel sorry for another person who is havin g a bad time, you might use that phrase, “Oh, you poor thing.” She says, “Do yo u have a headache?” Eiji says, “Yes, a very bad one. My head is throbbing.”  

The verb “to throb” (throb) means to have a very, i n this case, painful feeling that starts and stops regularly. Often when you have a b ad headache, you feel like your head is throbbing. It’s almost as though part of your head is like your heart. In fact, we use that verb “to throb” when describin g what a heart does. A “heart” is, of course, a muscle that is constantly moving. That motion, we could call a “throbbing motion.” It’s like something is going up  and down inside of your body. Well that’s the feeling of pain that Eiji is experi encing – a “throbbing pain” in his head. 

Lupe says, “Why don’t I get you some hot tea? That always helps me when I have a pounding headache.” The word “pounding” (pou nding) is the feeling, or we might say the sensation, of being hit repeatedly  – over and over again. Sometimes your headache feels like you’re being hit  in the head constantly. “Throbbing” and “pounding” are very closely related  in meaning here.  

Eiji says, “No, I just want to lie here quietly.” L upe says, “I know that when I have a tension headache, it always eases the pain when s omeone massages my neck and shoulders. Would you like that?” Lupe describes  what helps her when she has a “tension (tension) headache.” “Tension” is a feeling often caused by stress, where your muscles are tight.  

So, a “tension headache” is usually one that is cau sed by feeling stressed, or feeling anxious, or feeling nervous about something . Lupe says that it always “eases” (eases) the pain when someone “massages” (m assages) her neck and shoulders. “To ease” means to reduce pain or to get  rid of pain. A “massage” is when someone rubs your body, usually in an effort t o relax your muscles, to make them less tight. Eiji says he doesn’t want a m assage from Lupe. He says it’s not a tension headache.  

“It came on suddenly,” he adds. When something “com es on,” it begins very quickly or without warning. When we say a headache “came on suddenly,” we mean it appears to have started instantly. It wasn’ t a small headache that grew into a big headache. It was a big headache right aw ay. Lupe says, “Then it’s not a sinus headache either?” A “sinus (sinus) headache ” is a headache caused by pain in, of course, your sinuses. Your sinuses are in your head. They’re connected to, or part of, your breathing that is do ne through your nose.  

Sometimes when we have a cold or our sinuses become  infected, it’s difficult to breathe, but also it causes pain in our head. Lupe says, “Are you feeling pain around your cheekbones?” Your “cheeks” (cheeks) are  the parts of your face that are located on either side of your nose. Your “chee kbones,” then, are the bones that are on that part of your face below your eyes,  on either side of your nose.  

Eiji says, “No, it’s not a sinus headache.” He adds , “I feel a little nauseous actually.” “Nauseous” (nauseous) is an adjective th at describes a feeling in your stomach that you’re going to be sick – that you’re going to, we would say, “throw up” or “vomit.” “To vomit” is when the contents of your stomach, what’s in your stomach, comes out through your mouth – not a very nice feeling.  

Lupe says, “Ah, then it must be a migraine (migrain e).” A “migraine,” or “migraine headache,” is a very severe, a very intense headach e that causes a lot of pain. Sometimes it can also cause “nausea” – that is, tha t feeling of being sick in your stomach – as well as problems with your vision. You  can’t see properly. Not all migraines, however, have those symptoms or those th ings that are associated with it.  

Lupe says, “That explains the dark room and the nee d for quiet.” People who get migraine headaches often are able to ease their pai n by lying down and turning off the lights. “I know the perfect cure for a migr aine,” Lupe says. A “cure” (cure) is something that helps a medical problem; usually it’s something that makes the medical problem – the sickness, the disease, the il lness – go away. Some of you old enough might remember a rock band called the Cu re that was popular in the ’80s and ’90s – the old days. 

Anyway. Lupe thinks she has the perfect cure for a migraine. Eiji says, “Me, too,” meaning I also know what the perfect cure is. “But, ” he adds, “I don’t have it here.” We get the feeling right now that perhaps Ei ji is just trying to get rid of Lupe. He wants Lupe to leave him alone. Lupe says, “I’d be happy to get it for you.” Eiji says, “Great. The only place that stocks  it is in the next town.  

“To stock” something means for a store to have some thing available to sell you. That’s why we sometimes use the expressions “in sto ck” and “out of stock.” If you go to a store to buy say a pair of shoes and the st ore says, “We don’t have that kind in stock,” they mean they don’t actually have any of those shoes there at their store. They are, we might also say, “out of s tock.” “To be out of stock” means you don’t have it. “To be in stock” means you  do have it.  

Eiji says the only place that stocks this drug, we’ re guessing, is in the next town, meaning not in the town or small city where they ar e right now, but in one that is close to them, perhaps 10 miles or 20 miles or even  farther away. Lupe says, “But that’s over two hours away,” meaning the next town is two hours from where they are now. 

I must say that is a little unlikely if they’re in the main part of the United States. Most towns have another town within, oh, 10 or 20 m iles. That’s because when the country was first getting started, that’s about  how long you could go in a single day – but perhaps they’re located in Alaska.  I don’t know. Alaska is a big state located, of course, between Canada and Russia , that is part of the U.S. that doesn’t have very many towns or people in it.  

Eiji wants Lupe to go get him this medicine. Eiji s ays, however, “If it’s too much trouble” – meaning, well, if it is too much work or  involves too much time for Lupe, she doesn’t have to do it – but you can tell by the way he says it that he really wants Lupe to leave, to go to this town.  

Lupe then agrees. She says, “No, no, I’ll go.” She’ s saying, “No, it is not too much trouble. I’ll go to this town.” Then she asks,  “But how will you manage while I’m gone?” The verb “to manage” (manage) has a lot of different uses in  

conversational English. Here it means to be able to  do something that is difficult, to be able to survive through a difficult situation .  

Eiji says, “I’ll just have to find a way to muddle through.” In other words, “I’ll have to find a way to muddle through while you are gone,  without your help.” The phrasal verb “to muddle (muddle) through” something  means to be able to do something that is difficult even when you don’t hav e the necessary experience, education, or skills to do it. It means to be able to do something, but probably not do it very well. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
