This episode is a dialogue between Oleg and Daria a bout taking a test, an examination, in order to get your driver’s license.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Oleg: I failed! 

Daria: What?! How could you have failed your drivin g test again? 

Oleg: I got nervous and I did everything wrong.  

Daria: Like what? 

Oleg: When I accelerated, I ground my gears and rac ed the engine. The car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off he r seat. 

Daria: Oh, that’s bad. 

Oleg: Yeah, I know. I failed to stop at a traffic l ight and changed lanes in the intersection without signaling. 

Daria: Yikes. 

Oleg: The examiner told me to back off because I wa s tailgating the car in front of me. She also pointed out the speed limit because I had been speeding.  

Daria: It couldn’t have gone much worse, could it? 

Oleg: Oh yes, it could have and it did. When she wa rned me about my speed, I got so flustered that I slammed on the brakes and n early caused an accident.  

Daria: What did she say when that happened? 

Oleg: She cried uncle and told me to take her back to the office as fast as humanly possible!

Oleg says to Daria at the beginning of our dialogue , “I failed!” “To fail” (fail) means not to pass some test or examination, or simp ly to not obtain the result that you wanted to get – to not reach the goal you wanted to reach. “I failed to lose 20 pounds in one week.” If your goal was to lo se 20 pounds in one week and you didn’t, you would say you “failed,” though that is probably not a very realistic goal. We usually think of the verb “to fa il” as being opposite of the verb “to pass,” especially in school or related to some sort of test or examination.  

Oleg failed. Daria says, “What?! How could you have  failed your driving test again?” We learn now that Oleg failed his driving t est. A “driving test” is an examination you must take in order to get a license  to drive. In the United States, each state has its own exam, its own test, and when  you move from one state to another, you often have to take the exam again, or at least the written exam, because there are actually two parts of the exam in  most states.  

There is a test that you take I suppose nowadays on  a computer. I’m so old I remember taking the test using a piece of paper. If  you pass that test, then you have to take what’s called a “behind the wheel test ,” which means you get into a car with someone from the government and you have t o demonstrate, show that you know how to drive. It sounds as though Oleg fai led the “behind the wheel test,” or the test in the car.  

Oleg says, “I got nervous and I did everything wron g.” Daria says, “Like what?” meaning “What did you do wrong?” Oleg explains, “Wh en I accelerated, I ground my gears and raced the engine. The car jerked so ha rd that the examiner nearly fell off her seat.” “To accelerate” (accelerate) me ans to increase in speed, especially when you put your foot on what’s called the “gas pedal” (pedal) in order to make the car go faster. We call that “acce lerating the car,” making the car go faster. The opposite of accelerate is “decel erate.”  

Well, in Oleg’s case, when he accelerated, when he tried to make the car go faster by putting his foot on the gas pedal, he “gr ound the gears.” “To grind”  

(grind) – “ground” is the past tense of “grind” – “ the gears” (gears) means to cause the car to make a loud noise as you change th e gears from one to another, or go from one gear to another, I should s ay.  

There are two basic kinds of cars. There are cars t hat have what is called a “manual (manual) transmission” and cars that have “ automatic transmissions.” In a manual transmission, you have to change gears as the car goes faster or slower, and you have to do that each time you accel erate or decelerate. In an automatic transmission, you don’t have to do any of  those things – at least, you don’t have to change gears from first gear to, say,  fourth or fifth gear.  

Most American cars nowadays have automatic transmis sions, but I used to own a manual transmission, which we sometimes refer to as a “stick” (stick). A “stick” refers to the pole or stick that comes out of the t ransmission, into the center of the car that you use to change gears. So if someone  asks you if you know how to “drive a stick” or a “stick shift” (shift), the per son is referring to a car with a manual transition.  

Oleg was driving a stick shift, or manual transmiss ion car, and he didn’t know how to shift or change gears properly. So when he a ccelerated, he “ground the gears” – basically he failed to put his foot proper ly on another pedal or piece of metal near your feet called the “clutch” (clutch). You put your foot on the clutch in order to change from one gear to another. If you do n’t do that correctly, you will end up grinding the gears, which is a very ugly sou nd.  

Oleg says he “raced the engine” when he accelerated . “To race (race) the engine (engine)” means to take your car out of gear, we wo uld say – that is, put your car in “neutral” (neutral) so that the car isn’t in any  gear and then put your foot on the gas or your foot on the gas pedal, we would say. If  you do that, the “motor” or the “engine” of the car will move very fast. It will ma ke a loud noise but the car won’t move, because in order for the car to move, you hav e to be what we would describe as “in gear” – that is, you have to be or put the transmission into one of the gears – first, second, third, fourth, or, if yo u want to go backwards, reverse gear.  

See, I’m teaching you how to drive as well as teach ing you English today. In any case, Oleg didn’t do a very good job. He says, “The  car jerked so hard that the examiner nearly fell off her seat.” The verb “to je rk” (jerk) here means to move suddenly or unexpectedly. So, if the car “jerked,” it’s moved quickly without you being ready for it. The “examiner” is the person fr om the government who decides if you pass or fail the driving test. This poor examiner “nearly,” or almost, “fell off her seat,” meaning she almost went from h er seat to the floor of the car.   

 Daria says, “Oh, that’s bad.” Oleg says, “Yeah, I k now. I failed to stop at a traffic light and changed lanes in the intersection without  signaling.” A “traffic light” is a light that tells you whether you should stop where two streets cross, or go. In the U.S. and in many countries, the color red means you  stop and green means you can go. If you don’t stop at a traffic light when t he light is red, that of course is very bad and dangerous, as well as being against th e law. When Oleg says he “failed to stop at a traffic light,” he means the t raffic light was red and he was supposed to stop.  

He also says he “changed lanes in the intersection. ” “Lanes” (lanes) are the different sections of the street or the freeway in which the cars move. The “lanes” are usually separated by painted lines on the stree t or highway. “To change lanes” means to go from one lane to the next. The “ intersection” (intersection) is where two streets cross, usually at a right or nine ty-degree angle. You’re not supposed to change lanes when you are in the middle  of an intersection.  

Oleg also says that he “changed lanes without signa ling” (signaling). “To signal” means to turn on the lights in your car that blink,  or go on and off quickly, telling the other drivers what direction you’re going to mo ve. If you are going to move from one lane to another, you are supposed to turn your signal on so that a light goes on and off at the back and front of your car, telling other drivers that you are going to move lanes. Oleg says he changed lanes “wi thout signaling.” By the way, it doesn’t matter if you signal your lane chan ge in the middle of an intersection or not; it’s illegal in most states to  change lanes in an intersection even if you signal. 

Daria says “Yikes,” which is an expression of surpr ise, usually at a bad thing. Oleg continues, “The examiner told me to back off b ecause I was tailgating the car in front of me.” “To back off” is a two-word ph rasal verb that here means to increase the distance between you and the person – or in this case, car – in front of you. If you are too close to the car in front of  you, we sometimes call that “tailgating” (tailgating). “To tailgate” means to f ollow another car too closely so that if the other car were to stop quickly, you mig ht cause an accident by hitting that car because you can’t stop quickly enough.  

Here in Los Angeles, if you drive too slowly, cars will often tailgate you. They will come up right behind you to try to get you to move faster or to move to another lane so they can drive around you. Oleg was tailgat ing the car in front of him. The examiner also pointed out, or told him, the speed l imit of the road on which they were driving. The “speed limit” is the maximum spee d you can drive. In most freeways in the United States, you can drive betwee n 60 and 70 miles per hour.  

In most city streets, the speed is much lower, from  25 to 40 miles an hour, typically.  

The examiner pointed out the speed limit to Oleg be cause he had been “speeding.” “To speed” (speed) means to be driving faster than the speed limit – to be driving too fast. Daria says, “It couldn’t ha ve gone much worse, could it?” meaning this was probably the worst that Oleg could  have done. Oleg says, “Oh yes, it could have and it did,” meaning things actu ally got worse than what he has so far described.  

He says, “When she,” the examiner, “warned me about  my speed, I got so flustered that I slammed on the brakes and nearly c aused an accident.” “To get flustered” (flustered) means to get confused or wor ried, usually because you are in a very stressful or difficult situation. Oleg go t flustered and “slammed (slammed) on the brakes (brakes).” The “brakes” are  what causes the car to slow down or stop.  

“To slam on the brakes” means to put your foot very  quickly and with a lot of pressure on what is called the “brake pedal.” There  are basically three pieces of metal, called “pedals,” on the bottom of your car, near your feet. In most cars, there’s a gas pedal and a brake pedal, and in a man ual transmission or stick there is also a clutch pedal. Oleg slammed on the b rakes. He put his foot on the brake pedal very suddenly, and this nearly caused a n accident because the car stopped quickly and no doubt the car behind him had  difficulty stopping quickly as well.  

Daria says, “What did she say when that happened?” Oleg says, “She” – again, the examiner – “cried uncle and told me to take her  back to the office as fast as humanly possible!” “To cry (cry) uncle (uncle)” is a somewhat unusual phrase. It means to end an activity suddenly or to end a game suddenly, usually allowing the other person to win.  

“To cry uncle” or “to say uncle” is, some people th ink, a very old expression that comes from the Romans. It’s used when you are basic ally giving up, when you are saying to the other person, “You win.” It’s use d especially if the other person is forcing you to do something or you are doing so badly that you simply want to give up. Oleg said that the examiner “cried uncle.”  She gave up on this exam and told Oleg to take her back to the office “as fast a s humanly possible,” meaning very quickly.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
