This episode is a dialogue between a mother and her  son, Paul.  They’re talking about things that a young student would need when t hey begin their school year. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom:  It’s your first day at a new school.  I’m wor ried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’ll be fine.

Mom:  Do you have all of your books and supplies in  your backpack?  Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.

Paul:  You didn’t have to do that, Mom.  I was goin g to buy lunch at school.

Mom:  Now you won’t have to.  I hope you make some new friends.  It’s no fun being a loner.  It’s not that you have to be popula r.  I just don’t want you to feel left out.

Paul:  I’ll be fine, Mom.  I’d better go, or I’ll b e late.

Mom:  Do you think the school will do something spe cial to kick off the new school year?  I hope your teachers aren’t too stric t.  Oh, your backpack weights a ton!  But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?

Paul:  They don’t have lockers at my new school, bu t I’ll be fine.

Mom:  I hope the teachers don’t already have seatin g plans.  I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom.  And I hope you  won’t have too much homework on the first day…

Paul:  Mom, stop fussing.  Everything will be fine.

Mom:  You’re my baby and I’m worried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’m not starting kindergarten.  I’m sta rting college, remember?

Mom begins by saying to Paul, “It’s your first day at a new school.  I’m worried about you.”  Paul says, “Mom, I’ll be fine.”  I’ll be okay; don’t worry about me. Mom says, “Do you have all of your books and suppli es in your backpack?”  The word “supplies” means all of the things that you ne ed for a particular purpose, for a specific thing that you are going to do, especial ly in school or in an office. Office supplies would include pens, paper, notebook s, uh…paperclips, that sort of thing – things you use in an office.  School sup plies would be things that students typically use in school, often things that  you use up, or consume, so that you need to get more in the future.  A “backpack” ( one word) is a usually cloth or leather bag that you wear on your back; it has some thing so that you can put it on both of your shoulders.  It’s common in many sch ools for children – students – to have backpacks to carry their books and supplies  from class to class.  It wasn’t very common when I was in school, maybe because we didn’t study very much so we didn’t have very many books!  I’m not sure.  But I didn’t have a backpack in high school; I did have a backpack in college, a nd at the university it’s very common to see backpacks.  In many high schools you have a place where you keep your books that’s called a “locker” (locker); it’s a little space for each student.  I’m not sure if schools still have locker s; I think many of them do, but it’s something you would find in a high school.  At the university, you would have to have a backpack, or if you were in elementary or gr ade school as a younger student.  It’s interesting, backpacks are considere d for children in some countries, but in the United States you will find t hem mostly at the university.

Mom continues by saying, “Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.”  “To pack (someone) a lunch” means usually to put some food –  a sandwich, an apple, perhaps a candy bar – into a small bag so they can take it with them.  You might pack a lunch if you are going on a trip in your car  and don’t want to stop to eat. Packing a lunch is common for people going to work who don’t want to spend money buying food at a restaurant.

Paul, I guess, has a lot of money because he says, “You didn’t have to do that, Mom.  I was going to buy lunch at school.”  Mom say s, “Now you won’t have to.  I hope you make some new friends.”  Remember, it’s a new school for Paul.  She says, “It’s no fun being a loner.”  A “loner” (lone r) is a person who is very quiet, who doesn’t have a lot of friends, who sits by him or herself.  That would be a loner.  “It’s not that you have to be popular,” Mom  says, “I just don’t want you to feel left out.”  “To be popular” means to be liked by many other people.  “Popular” has some other meanings as well; take a look at our  Learning Guide for those. “To feel left out” means to feel that or think that  you don’t belong to any group, that people are not accepting you, that they did no t invite you to do something with them.  Paul says, “I’ll be fine, Mom.  I’d bet ter go, or I’ll be late.”  I should go, he’s saying, because if I don’t I will be late.

Mom says, “Do you think the school will do somethin g special to kick off the new school year?”  “To kick off” is a phrasal verb that  here means to start something, especially with a lot of enthusiasm.  “We’re going to kick off our celebration by singing and dancing.”  We’re going to begin it; we’ re going to start it.  “Kick” has a number of different meanings; take a look at our Le arning Guide for some additional ones.  The “school year” is sometimes ca lled the “academic year.”  In most American schools it begins in late August-earl y September and ends in May or June, depending on the school.  Mom continues, “ I hope your teachers aren’t too strict.”  “To be strict” (strict) means to foll ow all of the rules and make sure that you follow all of the rules, that you obey the  rules.  So, a strict teacher would be someone, for example, who doesn’t allow anyone t o talk in class, and if they do they would be punished.  Of course, the teacher can talk and the teacher can ask students to answer questions.  But, a strict te acher would follow the rules and be very serious about them and punish people wh o don’t follow the rules.

So, Mom is asking or hoping that the teachers that Paul has won’t be too strict. She says, “Oh, your backpack weights a ton!”  A “to n” (ton) is a unit of measurement equal to 2,000 pounds.  But the express ion “to weigh a ton” means that something is very heavy, that it weighs a lot.   It doesn’t actually weigh a ton, but it’s very heavy.  Mom says, “But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?”  I mentioned earlier that in American high schools many of them have lockers (lockers).  These are basically little  storage places that each student has; they’re given one were they can put their book s and lunch and other supplies.  In most schools, you need to lock your l ocker; you need to bring or to buy a lock; the school usually doesn’t give you a l ock.  You have to get one yourself, with a key or a combination lock.  Locker s are popular in high schools, in some junior high schools, and elementary schools .  If you’ve watched almost any movie about American high schools, you will kno w what lockers are. Students often spend time at them in between their classes talking.  It’s popular

in many schools to put pictures inside of your lock er; girls often put pictures of attractive actors and singers, that sort of thing.  I don’t think I ever put a picture of anyone in my locker.  I did remember having a calen dar in my last year of school, where I would at the end of each day cross off – pu t an “X” on the calendar for that day, counting the number of days left of schoo l.  You can tell I really loved my high school!

Anyway, Paul says that his new school doesn’t have lockers.  Mom says, “I hope the teachers don’t already have seating plans.”  A “seating plan” is when a teacher decides where each student will sit.  Somet imes teachers will put students in alphabetical order, so if your last nam e begins with “A” you sit in the front and if your last name begins with “Z” you sit  in the back.  Other teachers make seating plans based on other criteria – other reasons.  I used to have a seating plan.  I would let students sit where they wanted to – this is when I was a high school teacher many years ago, 20 years ago – and then after the first day I would write their names down, where they were, and that’s where they had to stay unless they caused problems, in which case I w ould move them to a different seat.  That’s a seating plan, and it’s ve ry popular in high schools and elementary schools.

Mom says, “I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom.”  The “classroom” is the room where the students sit and the teacher stands in front and gives the lesson.  I, personally, always liked to sit in the back of the classroom.  Mom says, “And I hope you won’t have to o much homework on the first day.”  “Homework” are things that students ha ve to do outside of school for their class; we might call them “school assignments .”

Paul then says, “Mom, stop fussing.”  This is a goo d word.  “To fuss” (fuss) means to worry about many things that other people don’t think are very important.  You’re worrying about small things, thi ngs that aren’t important, but you are acting as if they were important; this is t o fuss.  It’s a criticism to say someone is fussing, and Paul is criticizing his mot her by saying “stop fussing.” “Everything will be fine,” he says.  Mom says, “You ’re my baby and I’m worried about you.”  Paul says, “Mom, I’m not starting kind ergarten.”  “Kindergarten” is school for young children, usually five years old.  In many places you go to kindergarten first.  It’s not required, but many sc hools offer a kindergarten program for five-year-olds, and then when you’re si x years old you begin first grade – the first grade of elementary school.  Befo re kindergarten there is what’s called “preschool.”  When I was a child, I think I went to preschool for a half a day for at least a few months.  It was not at a regular  school; it was at a public building – a park actually.  And then, kindergarten  was also half-day; that is, I didn’t go the whole day, I went in the morning and then came home in the

afternoon.  That’s when I was five years old.  Anyw ay, as interesting as my life may be, let’s finish up the story here.  Paul says,  “I’m not starting kindergarten. I’m starting college, remember?”  And that, of cour se, is the joke.  Mom is treating Paul as if he were a young child, when in fact his new school is the university.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 We never want our scriptwriter to feel left out.  T hat’s because it’s the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
