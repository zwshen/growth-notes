be a <em>n</em>th degree polynomial with coefficients <img
src="p930b.gif" width="40" height="15">. If <font
size="4"><em>z</em></font> is a root of <font
size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font>, that is, <font
size="4"><em>P(z)=0</em></font>, then the first degree polynomial
<font size="4"><em>(x-z)</em></font> divides <font
size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font>, that is, <font
size="4"><em>P(x)=(x-z)Q(x)</em></font>, where <font
size="4"><em>Q(x)</em></font> is a polynomial with a degree less than
<font size="4"><em>n</em></font>. In the same way, if <font
size="4"><em>w</em></font> is a root of <font
size="4"><em>Q(x)</em></font>, then <font
size="4"><em>Q(x)=(x-w)R(x)</em></font>, and, obviously, <font
size="4"><em>P(x)=(x-z)(x-w)R(x)</em></font>, which means that <font
size="4"><em>w</em></font> is a root of <font
size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font>, also. This means that the more roots of
<font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> we know, the easier it is to know
the ones we don't know, because we are obtaining polynomials of
decreasing degrees. When, finally, we obtain a 2nd degree polynomial,
<img src="p930c.gif" width="60" height="14"> , as a result of the
division, we have a very simple way of finding its two roots: we use
the quadratic formula <img src="p930d.gif" width="79"
height="33"> to compute them. </p>

<p align="justify">How can we find <font
size="4"><em>Q(x),</em></font> such that 
<font size="4"><em>P(x)=(x-z)Q(x)</em></font>, having <font
size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> and one of its roots, <font
size="4"><em>z</em></font>? That is, how can we divide <font
size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> by <font size="4"><em>(x-z)</em></font>?
We describe here the <font size="4"><strong>Ruffini</strong></font>
rule, a simple process for dividing polynomials by 1st degree
polynomials of the form <font size="4"><em>(x-z)</em></font>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>On a first line we write the coefficients of <font
        size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> (see figure I). </li>
    <li>On a second line we write the root of the polynomial <font
        size="4"><em>(x-z)</em></font>, which is <font size="4"><em>z</em></font>
        (see figure II). </li>
    <li>On the third line we start by writing the first
        coefficient of <font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> which
        is 3 (see figure III). </li>
    <li>Then we write on the second line, right below the second
        coefficient of <font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font>, the
        value -6 which is the product of <font size="4"><em>z</em></font>
        (which is -2) by the previous value on the third line
        (which is 3). Then we write on the third line, right
        below that -6 product value, the sum of that -6 value
        with the second coefficient of <font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font>
        (which is 6), which gives the value zero (see figure IV).
    </li>
    <li>We repeat the previous step for the remaining
        coefficients of <font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> (see
        figure V).<br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="p930e.gif" width="297" height="399"></p>


<P align="justify"> 
At the end, we obtain on the third line the coefficients of
the resulting polynomial - <font size="4"><em>Q(x)</em></font> -
and the remainder of the division (in this case is zero because
we are dividing <font size="4"><em>P(x)</em></font> by one of its
roots). In figure V we see the coefficients of <font size="4"><em>Q(x)</em></font>.
So, <img src="p930f.gif" width="139" height="16"> . The
remainder of the division is zero, as expected.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 
Your task consists of writing a program that, given the
coefficients of a nth degree polynomial, and n-2 roots of that
polynomial, finds the other two roots. Assume that all roots are
real.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 

The input is one text file (standard input) that has, in the
first line, the number <i>k</i> of polynomials that are to be
processed. The next 3*<i>k</i> lines contain the information
about the <i>k</i> polynomials. The first of each set of three
lines contains the value <i>n</i> of the polynomial degree; the
second of each set of three lines contains n+1 values separated
by spaces (the coefficients of the polynomial), and the third of
each set of three lines contains n-2 values which represent n-2
roots of the polynomial. You know that there can be some repeated
roots; the third line of each set of three lines contains exactly
n-2 root values, even if some of them are repeated. 


<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify"> 

The output file must have <i>k</i>*2 lines, each pair
containing each of the two unknown roots of the polynomial. Each
pair of roots must be in decreasing order. These values must be
rounded to one decimal place.
