This dialogue is between Becky and Saeed; it’s about blow ing the whistle.  “To blow the whistle” is to tell someone about something th at is wrong in your company or organization.  If someone is doing something i llegal like stealing, to blow the whistle would be to tell your boss or to tell the police.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

Becky:  What are we going to do?

Saeed:  I don’t know.  I need time to think about the  ramifications of blowing the whistle.

Becky:  There are no two ways about it.  If we step up a nd do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.

Saeed:  But we can’t keep quiet about this.  If it get s out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble.  And plus, t hink of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.  Could we li ve with that?

Becky:  Maybe there is a way for us to protect our interest s and still do the right thing.  Maybe we could be anonymous whistleblowers.

Saeed:  Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous.   When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-deep.  There’s only one thing to do.

Becky:  What?

 Saeed:  I have to put my money where my mouth is and g o public with what we know.  I’ll just have to let the chips fall where they ma y.

Becky:  Don’t be too hasty.  Let’s sleep on it and talk abo ut it tomorrow.

Saeed:  You can do that if you want to, but I’ve made  up my mind.  The question is: Are you with me?

Our dialogue begins with Becky saying to Saeed, “What are  we going to do?” Saeed says, “I don’t know.  I need time to think about t he ramifications of blowing the whistle.”  “Ramifications” are consequences, implicat ions, something that will happen because you do something, especially when you’re n ot exactly sure what will happen if you do something: the consequences of your actions.  To blow the whistle means to share information about something wron g or bad that someone is doing because you want to stop it; you’re either telli ng someone in your company – the president or your boss – about something th at people are doing wrong, or you’re perhaps telling the government that yo ur company or organization is doing something wrong or illegal.

Becky says, “There are no two ways about it.”  This an idiom  that means there is no doubt, it’s very clear; this can happen in only one wa y, there are no different options for us.  There’s only one thing we can do, that’ s the meaning of there are no two ways about it.  She says, “If we step up and do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.”  She saying that this i s what will happen, there is no other choice for us.  “If we step up,” that is, if we vol unteer to do or to participate in this action – if we come forward, which is another ph rasal verb that means the same thing – if we go to the boss or to the government , “we are putting our jobs on the line.”  Something that is “on the line” is some thing that is at risk, in danger, there’s a possibility that you could lose it.  To say your j ob is on the line means depending on what I do I could lose my job very soon.

Saeed says, “But we can’t keep quiet about this (we can’t not tell anyone).  If it gets out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get i nto even more trouble.”  Notice the very popular word “get” in English; there are all sorts of phrasal verbs – two- word verbs that use the verb “get.”  This one is “get o ut.”  “To get out” means for information – secret or private information to become public, to become known by many people.  There are other meanings of this expressi on also, and those are in the Learning Guide.

 Saeed says, “If it gets out (if this news about this bad t hing is publicized – if people find out about it), we’ll get into even more trouble.”  Notice “into,” the preposition, connected with “get.”  “To get into trou ble” means to be in trouble, to go from not being in trouble to being in trouble.  Saeed says, “And plus (meaning in addition), think of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.” “To keep your mouth shut” means not to tell anyone, not to say anything to anyone else, to be quiet.  This is something I have a gre at deal of difficulty doing: keeping my mouth shut.  My wife tells me this almost every d ay!  Saeed is worried that people will get hurt if they don’t tell  someone; he says, “Could we live with that?”  “To live with” means to be able to t olerate something.  It’s a phrasal verb meaning to put up with something, to be a ble to continue living your life.

Becky says, “Maybe there is a way for us to protect our intere sts and still do the right thing.”  “To protect your interests” means you are taking care of yourself, you are making sure you don’t get hurt.  She wants to pr otect herself, but she also wants to do the right thing.  She says then, “Maybe  we could be anonymous whistleblowers.”  “To be anonymous” means that no one kno ws your name, that no one knows who you are.  So, you write a note to a gi rl you like but you don’t put your name on the note; the note is anonymous.  I’m  not sure why you would do that; it seems kind of stupid to me.  You, of course,  would want the girl to know your name.  But, I suppose maybe you want to provide some mystery about your identity – it’s possible!

Back to the story, Saeed says, “Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous.” “Don’t count on” means don’t rely upon, don’t depend u pon, it’s not for certain. Saeed says, “When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-d eep.”  “To blow up” here means to become a major problem, to be a situatio n that will affect many different people in a bad way.  “To blow up” has othe r meanings in English as a phrasal verb; those are in that Learning Guide we talke d about earlier.  So, Saeed is saying, “When this thing blows up (when people find out about it and it becomes a big problem), we’ll be in knee-deep.”  “To be in knee (knee) -deep” means to be heavily involved in something, you are very much  involved in it. Often, it’s a bad thing, but you could also say “I’m knee -deep in work this week,” I have so much work I can barely think, I’m heavily involved in  it.

Saeed says, “There’s only one thing to do.”  Becky asks, “What ?”  He says, “I have to put my money where my mouth is and go public wit h what we know.” This is an expression: “to put your money where your mouth  is,” it means to stop talking about something and actually do it; not just to say you’re going to run a

 marathon, but actually to practice and run the maratho n.  We use it when someone has finally decided to do something that they’ve b een talking about.  It also is used sometimes when you give advice to someone, and yo u need to actually do something as part of that advice: “I’m going to help you find a job.”  I promise you something; I’m going to put my money where m y mouth is, I’m actually going to call some people to find you a job.  “ To go public” means to share information with many people, especially the newspa pers or the television news programs.

Saeed says, “I’ll just have to let the chips fall where th ey may.”  This expression, “to let the chips (chips) fall where they may,” means to  do something even though something bad might be a result of your action, to do something and not think about the positive or negative ramifications, or con sequences, of your action.

Becky, however, says, “Don’t be too hasty” (hasty).  That mea ns don’t be so rushed, don’t do it quickly, think about this decision.   She says, “Let’s sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow.”  “To sleep on it” means t o think about something overnight; to go home, to fall asleep, continue thinkin g about it, and the next day you make your decision.  Saeed says, “You can do that if you  want to, but I’ve made up my mind (I’ve decided).  The question is: Are yo u with me?” meaning are you going to help me; support me; agree with me.

Let’s listen to the dialogue now at a normal speed.
