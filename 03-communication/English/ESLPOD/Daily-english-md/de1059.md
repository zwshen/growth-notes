This episode is all about describing someone who is  restless and jumpy. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adam: Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like tha t!

Ellen: Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it. I’m just a little jittery.

Adam: Well, try to chill out. We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.

Ellen: I can’t help it. I’m like this because I had  a lot of coffee. That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.

Adam: But how can you study when you’re fidgeting a ll the time? Stop tapping your pen on the table!

Ellen: Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall a sleep, and tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one for me. I’ve got to do well.

Adam: I don’t see how you can get any studying done  when you’re strung out on caffeine. You’re so jumpy, and I think you’re start ing to twitch. Why don’t you try to counteract the caffeine by drinking lots of wate r?

Ellen: Do you know how long it took me to get this keyed up? I’m not doing anything to reduce the effects.

Adam: Fine.

Ellen: Hey, where are you going?

Adam: Anywhere but here!

Adam and Ellen are college students. They are study ing for a test – they are preparing to take an examination. Adam says to Elle n, “Sit still and stop bouncing your leg like that!” When you tell someone to “sit still” (still), you are telling him to sit calmly, to sit without moving his arms or his l egs. Usually it’s something you would say to a young child – for example, at a rest aurant, when the child is moving around too much: “Sit still!” Adam is tellin g Ellen, however, to sit still.

He says, “Stop bouncing your leg like that!” “To bo unce” (bounce) something is to move it up and down, usually against the floor or s ome other flat area or surface. When you think of a basketball, for example, you im agine it bouncing up and down. It goes up and down between the hand and the floor. Ellen isn’t bouncing a ball. She’s bouncing her leg up and down against the floor, and Adam is telling her to stop it.

Ellen says, “Sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it . I’m just a little jittery.” “To be jittery” (jittery) means to be nervous, to be unabl e to relax. Often when you’re jittery, your hands shake a little or your body mov es a little, almost involuntarily. Sometimes you’re jittery because you’re excited abo ut something. Sometimes you’re jittery because you’re nervous about somethi ng.

Adam says, “Well, try to chill out.” The phrasal ve rb “to chill (chill) out” means to relax, to stop worrying, to stop feeling depressed.  It’s an expression that was quite common 20, 30 years ago. I’m not sure how com mon it is today, but people still say it: “Chill out.” You don’t want to say th is to someone you don’t know well, however. You wouldn’t want to say it to your boss, for example. The expression has something of a criticism in its tone, and so it ’s something you would say to a friend, perhaps, or to your spouse or your children , but not something you would say to someone in authority over you.

Adam tells Ellen, however, to chill out. He says, “ We’re supposed to be studying, and your restlessness is distracting.” “To be restl ess” (restless) means something similar to “to be jittery.” If you’re restless, you ’re moving around all the time because you’re nervous. “Restlessness” is just the noun that refers to the state of being restless. Adam is saying that Ellen’s restles sness “is distracting.” Something that is distracting is something that mak es it difficult for you to

concentrate or to focus on something. It takes your  attention away from where it should be.

Ellen says, however, “I can’t help it.” “I can’t he lp it” means I can’t stop myself from doing it; I can’t prevent it. “I’m like this,”  she says, “because I had a lot of coffee.” “To have a lot of coffee” is to drink a lo t of coffee. If you drink a lot of coffee, it may make you jittery because of a certai n chemical in the coffee called “caffeine.” Ellen says, “That’s the only way I can do an all-nighter.” Ellen is saying the only way she can do an all-nighter is to drink a lot of coffee.

What’s an “all-nighter?” An “all (all) – nighter (n ighter)” is when you study all night long for a test the next day. At least, that’s the most common use of the term. We often use the verb “to pull” with “all-nighter.” “I ’m going to pull an all-nighter.” That means I’m going to study all night without sleeping  for a test the next day. Now, you could also pull an all-nighter to complete a re port or to complete a paper.

Generally speaking, pulling an all-nighter is not a  good idea if you are studying for a test, because you’ll be so tired the next day , you’ll probably perform worse on the test than you would have if you had simply s lept, even though you studied more. To pull an all-nighter to complete a paper pr obably doesn’t matter, since the idea is that once you complete the paper, you’r e done and you can go to sleep.

I’ve pulled an all-nighter only once in my academic  career. I remember it very well. I was writing a paper about the Battle of Ban nockburn in Scotland, one of the most famous battles between England and Scotlan d, and I had to get this paper completed by the next morning. So, I stayed u p all night typing, as one did, on my typewriter, since this was before the days of  computers. I did finish the paper and I got a pretty good grade on it, thank yo u very much. But that was the only time I ever pulled an all-nighter. Anyway, it all brings back memories.

Adam says, “But how can you study when you’re fidge ting all the time?” “To fidget” (fidget) means to make small, rapid or quic k movements repeatedly, possibly without even being aware of it. When you’r e nervous, for example, or jittery you might move your finger up and down, or your leg up and down, without noticing that you’re doing it – without being compl etely aware that you’re doing it. Adam can’t understand how Ellen can study when she’ s fidgeting all the time.

Then Adam says to her, “Stop tapping your pen on the table!” “To tap” (tap) something with your finger would be to hit it with your finger repeatedly. You can also tap on a wall, for example. You could use your  fist to hit the wall repeatedly. That’s “tapping.” Adam is telling Ellen to stop tap ping the pen on the table. Ellen

says, “Sorry. It’s either I’m worked up or I fall a sleep.” Ellen is saying there are one of two possibilities right now: either she fall s asleep or she gets worked up. “To be worked up” means to have a lot of energy, to  have a lot of nervousness or anxiety.

Ellen says, “Tomorrow’s test is a make-or-break one  for me.” The phrase “make- or-break” means it’s something that is extremely im portant. It’s something that will decide whether you succeed or fail at somethin g. A make-or-break test would be one that would determine, for example, if you ar e going to pass a class or not. Ellen says, “I’ve got to do well,” meaning “I have to do well on the test.”

Adam says, “I don’t see how you can get any studyin g done when you’re strung out on caffeine.” “To be strung (strung) out” on so me substance or drug means to be affected in a very negative way, usually because  you’ve taken a lot of a certain drug. Ellen has drunk a lot of coffee, and therefore consumed a lot of “caffeine” (caffeine). “Caffeine” is the chemical s ubstance found in coffee, as well as other drinks, that can make you feel awake and e nergetic, but could also make you, if you drink too much of it, jittery and nervous.

Adam says to Ellen, “You’re so jumpy, and I think y ou’re starting to twitch.” “To be jumpy” (jumpy) means something similar to “to be  jittery.” It means to be nervous, to be anxious, to be moving around. “To tw itch” (twitch) means to move one part of your body very quickly and sometimes un controllably. When I have a bad allergic reaction – when my allergies are bothe ring me – sometimes my eye twitches. It moves involuntarily without me wanting  it to. (Technically, my eyelids twitch, not my actual eyes.)

Adam then says to Ellen, “Why don’t you try to coun teract the caffeine by drinking lots of water?” “To counteract” (counterac t) means to try to stop or prevent something else that is happening by doing s omething opposite of that, or to do something that somehow balances it out. If yo u start to get sleepy, you could counteract your sleepiness by drinking coffee  with caffeine in it. What Adam is suggesting here is that Ellen try to counte ract the effects of the caffeine by doing something else: by drinking a lot of water .

I’m not sure if drinking a lot of water counteracts  the effect of caffeine, but Adam seems to think so. Ellen says, “Do you know how lon g it took me to get this keyed up?” “To be keyed (keyed) up” is to be very e xcited or nervous or stressed. She says, “I’m not doing anything to redu ce the effects,” meaning, in this case, to make her less jumpy, less jittery. Ad am then says, “Fine,” meaning “okay.”

Ellen says, “Hey, where are you going?” Adam has st arted to get up and leave. Adam says, “Anywhere but here.” Adam doesn’t want t o stay with Ellen because she’s distracting him. That’s why he says, “Anywher e but here.” The use of the word “but” here means “except” – anywhere except he re, anywhere that isn’t here, if you will.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
