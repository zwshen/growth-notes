<P>
``PATH" is  a game played by two players on an <I>N</I> by <I>N</I> board, where <I>N</I> is a
positive integer.  (If <I>N</I> = 8, the board looks like a chess board.)  Two players
``WHITE" and ``BLACK" compete in the game to build a path of pieces played on
the board from the player's ``home" edge to the player's ``target" edge, opposite
the home edge.  WHITE uses white pieces and BLACK uses black pieces.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
For this problem you will play the ``referee" for  the game, analyzing boards
containing black and white pieces to determine whether either of the players has 
won the game or if one of the players can win by placing one of their pieces in 
an unfilled position.  WHITE's turn is next.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
A representation of a board on paper (and in a computer) is an N x N matrix of 
characters 'W', 'B', and 'U'; where W represents white pieces, B represents 
black pieces, and 'U' represents unfilled positions on the board.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
When we view a matrix representation of the board on paper, WHITE's home 
edge is the left edge of the board (the first column), and WHITE's target edge is 
the right edge (the last column).  BLACK's home edge is the top edge of the 
board (the first row), and BLACK's target edge is the bottom edge (the last row).  
Thus WHITE wants to build a path from left to right, and BLACK wants to build a 
path from top to bottom.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Two locations on the board are ``adjacent" if one is immediately to the left, to the
right, above, or below the other.  Thus an interior location on the board is 
adjacent to four other locations.  For <I>N</I> &gt; 1, corner locations each have two
adjacent locations, and for <I>N</I> &gt; 2, other border locations have three adjacent
locations.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
A path is a sequence of distinct positions on the board,

such that each pair <I>L</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and <I>L</I><SUB><I>i</I>+1</SUB> are adjacent for

A winning path for a player is a

filled with the player's pieces such that <I>L</I><SUB>0</SUB> is
a position on the
player's home edge and <I>L</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB> is a position on the player's target edge.  It is clear
that if one player has a winning path then the other player is blocked from having 
a winning path.  Thus if all the squares contain pieces, either there are no 
winning paths or exactly one of the players has at least one winning path.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>

Input is a series of game board data sets.  Each set begins with a line containing 
an integer specifying the size <I>N</I>, 0&lt;<I>N</I>&lt;81 of the (
<!-- MATH: $N \times N$ -->

game board.  This is
followed by a blank line and then by <I>N</I> lines, one for each row of the game
board, from the top row to the bottom row.  Each line begins with character and 
consists of <I>N</I> adjacent characters from the set `<TT>B</TT>', `<TT>W</TT>', `<TT>U</TT>'.  A blank line
separates each non-zero data set from the following data set.  The input is 
terminated by a single line containing a board size of zero.

</H2>
As referee, for each game board in a series of game boards your program
should report one of the five types of answers below:

<P>
<TT>White has a winning path.</TT>

<br>
<TT>Black has a winning path.</TT>

<br>
<TT>White can win in one move.</TT>  <EM> (White can place a piece in an unfilled position)</EM>

<br>
<TT>Black can win in one move.</TT>  <EM> (White can't win in one move AND Black can if White does't move)</EM>

<br>
<TT>There is no winning path.</TT>
