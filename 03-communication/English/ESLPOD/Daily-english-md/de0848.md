Our story begins when I say, “My friend Charles con vinced me” – persuaded me – “to go into business with him about a year ago.” “To go into business with” means to work together, usually as co-owners of a b usiness. You both own the

business. “I wish I had had the benefit of hindsigh t to say ‘no.’” “The benefit (benefit) of something” is the advantage of somethi ng, something that can be helpful in some way. What would be helpful here is “hindsight” (hindsight). “Hindsight” is the ability to look back at what hap pened, to know about something that happened in the past, and really understand it . Of course, in the real world, we don’t have the opportunity to go into the future  and look back and that’s the origin of this expression. “The benefit of hindsigh t,” means if I had known then what I know now. We have another expression: “Hinds ight is 20-20.” “20-20” is when you have perfect vision, when your eyes are wo rking perfectly. Looking back at something, you can always understand and se e it clearly, but, of course, when you make a mistake, you don’t necessarily know  what’s going to happen in the future. And that’s what happened to me in the s tory.

I say, “I was too trusting and that was my downfall .” “To be trusting” means to believe that another person is telling you the trut h. You don’t demand any proof. You don’t ask for any evidence. You just say, “Oh, well, I can trust that person. He’s a truthful person.” I say that “I was too trus ting and that” – being too trusting – “was my downfall.” A “downfall” – one word – is a  reason why something fails. It’s the source of a problem, the reason why someth ing goes bad.

“At first” – at the beginning – I say “everything w as fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground.” “To work your butt (butt) off” is an informal expression meaning to work very hard. You’re workin g so hard, you can’t work anymore. You’re very tired because you’re working s o hard. “To get a business off the ground” – to get anything off the ground – means to get it started, to, in this case, start a business and make it successful.  “As soon as it looked like the business was going well, however, Charles turned on  me.” “To turn on someone” means to suddenly change your relationship or your attitude towards another person so that you begin to attack that other perso n. You begin to become mean or aggressive toward that person. That’s “to turn o n someone” – to suddenly, after being perhaps, being friends with someone, be come their enemy. The expression “turn on” actually has a couple of diffe rent meanings. Some of those are in our Learning Guide.

So, Charles and I started this business. It became successful and then Charles changed – he turned on me. I say that, “I had never  been so deceived.” “To deceive” (deceive) means to lie to someone, not to be honest with someone. We also have the expression “to trick (trick) someone. ” That’s to deceive them, to get them to believe something that isn’t true, usually,  so that you have some sort of benefit, something good happens to you by lying to them.

I continue the story by saying that “Charles and I never signed a formal partnership agreement.” The word “formal” here just  means official – on a piece of paper, typically. An “agreement” is when two peo ple sign something, basically like a contract. It’s a formal legal document. “Par tnership” refers to two people working together. So, when you have a business in t he United States, it’s possible to form a legal partnership where the two of you sign an agreement, a piece of paper saying that you will work together a nd that you will split the company. You will divide the company in a certain w ay.

I say that Charles and I, since we were old friends , because we had been friends for many years, “relied on a verbal agreement.” “Ve rbal” (verbal) means the same as spoken, not written down, not written on a piece of paper. A “verbal agreement” is, of course, very difficult to try to do something with in the future since you could say, “Oh, I didn’t say that.” If yo u have a written document, you can actually look at the piece of paper and see wha t it says. The verbal agreement that Charles and I had was that we would own the business 50-50. “50-50” means 50% for him, 50% for me. We might als o say “half and half.” We each own half of the business.

“One day,” I say, “out of the blue,” meaning unexpe ctedly and very suddenly, “Charles said that as the owner of the business, he  had decided that my services were no longer needed.” In other words, Charles sai d that he was the owner of the business and that he no longer wanted me to wor k in the business. “I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner.” “Co- (co) owner” is someone who owns the business with you. This prefix “co-” is used when t wo people are working together, or two people have the same interest or t he equal amount of interest in something. For example, we could talk about “co-wor kers.” These are people who work together. We could also talk about “co-aut hors” – two people who write a book together. That’s the prefix “co-” and how it ’s used.

“I said that I was co-owner and Charles couldn’t ju st fire me.” He said – Charles – that “That was never the agreement and that he was the sole owner.” “Sole” (sole) means only. In this case, single, without an yone else. He’s the only owner. He said that he was the sole owner. “And that is ho w,” I say, “I got cheated out of being co-owner of a successful business.” “To get c heated” (cheated) out of something means that you are tricked so that you do  not get what you are supposed to get. You are deceived in such a way tha t typically, you lose money or you lose something of value.

“My old friend Charles, turned out to be unscrupulo us,” I say. “To be scrupulous” (scrupulous) can mean to be very careful about some thing. It could also mean to be too careful, to be too worried about things. But  to be “unscrupulous” means to

not be careful. But really, we use it to mean disho nest. “To be unscrupulous” means not to worry about what’s right or wrong, jus t to do things that are good for you. I say, “From now on” – from this point forward  – “I’ll be watching my back.” “To watch your back means to protect yourself again st other people, to be looking for dangers that other people might present  to you.

I also say, “I will be looking out for my own inter ests.” “To look out for your own interests” means to do what is most beneficial to y ou, without caring about what happens to other people. Of course, that’s not a ve ry good way to react to this situation, but that’s how I reacted in the story. I  decide I’ll be looking out for my own interests. I won’t care about what happens to a nyone else, just about what happens to me. I say, “No one will ever stab me in the back again.” “To stab” (stab) means to take a knife or a very sharp object  and put it into someone’s body. “To stab someone in the back” means to hurt s omeone, to deceive someone in such a way that they didn’t see it comin g. They didn’t realize what you were doing and suddenly they did. It doesn’t me an to actually kill someone with a knife, although it could. But it means, more  commonly, to be deceived or cheated by another person, especially a person that  you had trusted, and therefore didn’t expect to deceive you.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

My friend Charles convinced me to go into business with him about a year ago. I wish I had had the benefit of hindsight to say “no. ” I was too trusting and that was my downfall.

At first, everything was fine. We worked our butts off to get the business off the ground. But as soon as it looked like the business was going well, Charles turned on me. I had never been so deceived.

We never signed a formal partnership agreement. Sin ce we were old friends, we relied on a verbal agreement that we would own the business 50-50. One day, out of the blue, Charles said that as the owner of the business, he had decided that my services were no longer needed. I told him he was crazy. I was co-owner and he couldn’t just fire me. He said that that was  never the agreement and he was the sole owner.

And that is how I got cheated out of being co-owner  of a successful business. My old friend Charles turned out to be unscrupulous. F rom now on, I’ll be watching

my back and looking out for my own interests. No on e will ever stab me in the back again!
