This episode is a dialogue between Jerry and Helen about liquid – things that make you wet – how you describe how much liquid you  have and how liquid moves. All that coming up in this episode. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerry: Want to help me wash my car?

Helen: I guess so.

Jerry: Good. Squirt a little of this cleaning fluid  into this bucket.

Helen: Okay, done.

Jerry: Then pour a capful of this into the bucket a nd mix. After that, dribble three drops of this special liquid into it and stir until  you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.

Helen: Okay, but I usually just use soap and water.

Jerry: That might be fine for your car, but for my baby, it’s nothing but the best. Stop!

Helen: Why? I was just going to use this hose to sp ray water onto the car to get it wet.

Jerry: You can’t just splash water on the paint. Yo u have to let it flow gently down from the roof of the car in a cascade.

 Helen: You’re kidding, right?

Jerry: Not at all. Splattering water on the paint c ould damage it in the long run. Let the water gush out of the hose and onto the roo f of the car. Let it caress the car like you’re . . .

Helen: You know what? I think this is getting a lit tle weird. I think I’ll leave you and your baby alone.

Jerry begins our dialogue by asking Helen, “Want to  help me wash my car?” Jerry means “Do you want to help me wash my car?” I n informal conversational English, sometimes we will drop the “do you” part a nd simply use the main verb, which in this case is “want.” “Want to help me wash  my car?”

Helen doesn’t seem very excited. She says, “I guess  so.” That expression “I guess (guess) so” has nothing to do with trying to figure out the answer to a problem. Instead, it means yes, but in a way that i sn’t very enthusiastic. You’re not really interested. When someone says, “I guess so,” he means yes, but he isn’t very excited by it or doesn’t agree very stro ngly with what you are saying or asking. Jerry says, “Good,” meaning “I’m glad you want to help me.”

He tells Helen, “Squirt a little of this cleaning f luid into this bucket.” The verb “to squirt” (squirt) means to squeeze or to get liquid out of a bottle, usually through a very small hole or opening. It’s the verb we might use, for example, if we were putting ketchup or mustard onto a hot dog. “Ketchup ” and “mustard” are liquids that are in bottles – often nowadays plastic bottle s – that you can put your hand around and squeeze. You can make it so that the liq uid comes out of the hole at the top of the bottle. The verb there would be “to squirt” the liquid – to get the liquid out of the bottle by squeezing it.

Jerry wants Helen to squirt some cleaning fluid int o a bucket. “Fluid” (fluid) means the same as “liquid” (liquid). Both things re fer to something that, if you put it on your body, would make you wet. Well, it could  have some other consequences as well. A “liquid” is a technical ter m that is not a solid and not a gas. In the physical world we have gases, solids, a nd liquids. Something that is a “fluid” is a liquid.

The word “fluid” here is used as a noun. It can als o be used as an adjective. As an adjective, “fluid” means easily changeable or so mething that is changing.

Here, it’s a noun referring to liquid. Jerry wants Helen to squirt a little cleaning fluid into a “bucket” (bucket). A “bucket” is a rou nd container – round on the sides – that has a flat bottom. There’s no top on a bucke t. Buckets are usually used to carry liquids.

Helen says, “Okay, done,” meaning she has completed  that task. Jerry then says, “Pour a capful of this into the bucket and mi x.” A “cap” (cap) is what goes on top of a bottle to close it, to make sure that t he liquid doesn’t come out of the bottle. A “capful” would be the amount of liquid th at would fit into the cap of the bottle. So you actually pour the liquid – you pour the fluid. You put the fluid into the little cap until the cap is full. That’s how yo u get a “capful” (capful). Notice there’s just one “l” in “capful” even though the wo rd “full” normally has two “l”s.

So Jerry tells Helen “to pour” (pour) the liquid in to the cap until she has a “capful.” “Pour” means to move liquid from one cont ainer to another. After she puts this capful of liquid into the bucket, Helen i s supposed to mix it. “To mix” (mix) means to combine two things together. After s he mixes these liquids together, Jerry asks her to “dribble three drops of  this special liquid into it and stir until you get a nice layer of foam on the surface.”

There are several words there we need to explain. T he first one is “dribble” (dribble). “To dribble” means to cause a few small drops, a few small amounts of a liquid, to fall into a surface – or to fall onto a surface, we would probably say. If you like pancakes (and who doesn’t like pancakes), you might take some syrup, some sweet liquid, and “dribble” it onto your panca kes – put a little bit on there drop by drop, small amount of liquid by small amoun t of liquid.

That’s what Jerry tells Helen to do with some sort of special liquid that he has. Then he tells her to stir all this together. “To st ir” (stir) means to move a spoon or a stick in the liquid to combine or mix the liquid together. Sometimes, if you stir very quickly, you will cause the liquid to form wha t’s called a “foam” (foam). A foam is a liquid that has become or been made into small bubbles that sit on top of the liquid.

When you stir a liquid very quickly, very rapidly, air can enter into the liquid and form what’s called a “bubble.” A “bubble” (bubble) is liquid that has air inside of it. You can think of it that way. A balloon, for exampl e, is a kind of bubble, except instead of being made of liquid, it is made of plas tic. “Foam” is essentially a lot of small or tiny bubbles together on top of liquid.

Helen says, “Okay, but I usually just use soap and water.” She usually just uses soap and water when she washes her own car. Jerry s ays, “That might be fine

for your car” – meaning that’s good enough for your  car – “but,” Jerry continues, “for my baby, it’s nothing but the best.” The word “baby” here refers not to a young child, but to Jerry’s car.

Sometimes people use the word “baby” to describe so mething they own that they really love and they take care of. Some people love  their cars like children, I guess, and that’s the case with Jerry. He says for his baby – for his car – “it’s nothing but the best.” That means he will only use the very best products. He will only treat it in the very best way. He then tells H elen to stop doing what she’s doing. We’re not sure what she’s doing. But we find  out in the next sentence.

Helen says, “Why? I was just going to use this hose  to spray water onto the car to get it wet.” A “hose” (hose) is a long piece of tubing that is used to move water or other liquids from one place to another. If you have a lawn, if you have grass in front of your house or in back of your house, yo u may need to put water on it. You can use a “hose” to get water from your house o nto the lawn. The water will move through the hose, which is basically a plastic  tube.

Helen is using a hose “to spray” (spray) water onto  the car. “To spray” means to push liquid through many small holes, causing the l iquid to go out of the hose in small drops. For example, firefighters – people who  put out fires – use big hoses that spray water onto burning buildings. They spray  the water. The water moves in different directions to put the fire out.

Jerry says, “You can’t just splash water on the pai nt. You have to let it flow gently down from the roof of the car in a cascade.” “To sp lash” (splash) means to cause water to hit against something, usually in a forcef ul way – that is, the water hits the surface hard. Jerry doesn’t want Helen to splas h water onto his car. He wants the water “to flow” (flow) gently. “To flow” means to move liquid across a surface.

Jerry wants the water to come down over the car in a “cascade” (cascade). A cascade is when water or other liquid falls down ra pidly over a surface. You can think of a “waterfall” – when water falls from the top of one surface down quickly to another surface – as being a kind of cascade. In  fact, the word “cascade” sometimes is used to mean the same as “waterfall” i n English. Here it’s used, however, as a verb meaning to have the water act as  though it were a waterfall, flowing quickly, flowing rapidly across the surface  of the car.

Helen says, “You’re kidding, right?” meaning “You’r e joking.” Jerry says, “Not at all,” meaning “No. I’m not joking.” “Splattering wa ter on the paint could damage it in the long run.” “To splatter” (splatter) means to  cause a liquid to hit something.

It’s very similar to the previous verb “to splash.”  The verb “to splatter” is often used with paint as a liquid rather than water.

If you “splatter” paint on a wall, you cause the pa int to go on the wall, but not in any sort of pattern. You are causing the paint to make marks on the wall that perhaps you don’t want. Unless of course you are the artist Jackson Pollock, who was famous for splattering paint on pieces of canva s – things that you use to paint a painting on. He made a lot of money splatte ring paint.

Jerry doesn’t want Helen splattering water on the p aint of his car because he thinks it could hurt the paint. He says, “Let the w ater gush out of the hose and onto the roof of the car.” “To gush” (gush) means t o move liquid very quickly and in large amounts over a surface. He says, “Let the water caress the car.” “To caress” (caress) means usually to touch someone wit h your hand in a slow, gentle, pleasant way that shows that you love that person or you care for that person. You could also caress an object like a car.  And that’s what Jerry wants Helen to do with the water.

Clearly, Helen is not going to continue doing this.  She says, “You know what? I think this is getting a little weird.” She’s tellin g Jerry that she thinks the way he wants to wash his car is strange, is odd. Helen the n says, “I think I’ll leave you and your baby alone.” She saying that Jerry is trea ting his car as if the car were a person almost, and therefore she doesn’t want to be  part of this strange way of washing a car.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
