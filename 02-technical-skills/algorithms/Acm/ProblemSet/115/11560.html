<P>
A certain big IT company which we will not name in order not to get
sued, are preparing to launch a new version of their flagship product.
Having just been employed as a developer on the project, you have been
given a list of open bugs that should be fixed in the new version.

<P>
Being bugs, you are not exactly certain how to fix them, even though
you have some ideas.  For each bug you are able to estimate your
ability to quickly fix the bug.  Of course, these estimates may be
wrong, so if you try to fix a bug and fail, you will revise the
estimate of your ability to fix this bug.

<P>
To be specific, we use the following probabilistic model for the bug
fixing process: for each bug, there is an associated <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fix
probability</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.  Every hour, you choose one bug to work on, and work
on this bug for the entire hour (if you manage to fix the bug in less
then an hour, you celebrate by having coffee and taunting your
coworkers for the remaining part of the hour).  The probability that
you succeed in fixing the bug during this hour is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.  If you fail to
resolve the bug, the fix probability for this bug is reduced to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I><SUP> . </SUP><I>f</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, 
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>f</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11560img2.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">1</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is a factor indicating how much faith you lose
in your ability after a failure.  The fix probabilities for the other
bugs remain unchanged.  The next hour, you again choose an open bug to
work on, and so on.  This is repeated until the new version is
released, and you are allowed to go home and sleep.

<P>
In addition, each bug has a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">severity</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> indicating how severe
the bug is (or alternatively, the value of fixing the bug).  Clearly,
it is possible that you will not manage to fix all the bugs before
the product is released.  In order to make as good an impression on
your boss as possible, you would like to maximize the total severity
of those bugs which you do manage to resolve, by carefully choosing
which bugs to work on.  What will be the expected value of the total
severity of fixed bugs, provided that you, every hour, choose which
bug to work on in such a way that this quantity is maximized?

Each of the following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN>

<P>
For each test case, write to the output a line containing the expected total severity of bugs fixed,
provided you work in a way which maximizes this quantity.  Any answer

acceptable.
