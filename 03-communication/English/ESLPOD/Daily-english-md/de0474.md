We’re going to listen to a dialogue between Luis and Stevie; Stevie is a girl – a woman, here.  Stevie is going to be talking to Luis abo ut how she is having trouble sleeping at night, using a lot of vocabulary we might used to talk about that situation.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Luis:  So, how are the newlyweds doing? 

Stevie:  Oh, we’re great.  I’m just a little tired.   

Luis:  Well, that goes with the territory, right? 

Stevie:  No, that’s not what I mean.  Patrick has been ke eping me up with his snoring.    

Luis:  Oh, that’s a bummer. 

Stevie:  Yeah, it really is.  I’m usually awakened soon a fter I fall asleep, and then I toss and turn all night.  That’s not all.  Patrick also  talks in his sleep. 

Luis:  Wow, that’s terrible.  I’d make a beeline for so me sleeping pills, if I were you. 

Stevie:  I took some one night last week, but I woke up g roggy and disoriented. I’d rather have insomnia than load up on drugs.   

Luis:  Have you tried waking him up when he snores or tal ks in his sleep?

 Stevie:  I tried that one night, but he just ended up  sleepwalking!   

Luis:  Geez, what are you going to do? 

Stevie:  I wish I knew.   

Luis:  It’s a little early in your marriage for separate  bedrooms, but I wouldn’t rule it out. 

Stevie:  I’ll keep it in mind.  If I don’t get a good  night’s sleep soon, separate bedrooms will be the least of our problems! 

[end of dialogue] 

Luis asks Stevie, “So, how are the newlyweds doing?”  A “ newlywed” (newlywed – one word) is someone who has been married very recentl y, usually within the past year or so.  So the year after you are married, you might be called a “newlywed,” meaning you have been married recently.  Thi s is a question that Luis asks Stevie; he’s asking about Stevie and her new husban d.  Stevie says, “Oh, we’re great.  I’m just a little tired.”  Luis j okes with her and says, “Well, that goes with the territory, right?”  The expression “to go with the territory” means that it’s to be expected in a particular situation, it’s expected to be part of something.  So if you are a police officer, you need to learn to use a gun.  It goes with the territory: it’s part of your job; it’s part of  your responsibility. 

Luis is making a joke here, saying that Stevie is not getti ng very much sleep because she’s newly married, and newly married couples may do other things at night, for example, that would cause them not to sleep  as much.  I’m not sure; I’ve been married too long, I don’t remember far back in time!  Stevie says, “No, that’s not what I mean,” meaning no, she is not having  problems sleeping because she and her husband are doing other things in be d.  Stevie says, “Patrick (her husband) has been keeping me up with his sno ring.”  “To keep (someone) up” means to keep them awake, not allowing them to sleep.  “To snore” (snore) means to make a loud sound each time you b reathe through your nose while you are sleeping, something like [Jeff snores] .  I know, it’s pretty ugly, but that me snoring. 

Luis says, “Oh, that’s a bummer.”  A “bummer” (bummer) i s an informal term meaning a disappointment, something that you feel badl y about: “I’m not going to be able to go to the concert tonight, what a bummer, ” or “that’s a bummer.”  It’s a bad thing.  It’s an informal expression, however.  Stevi e says, “Yeah, it really is,”

 meaning yes, it is a bummer.  “I’m usually awakened soon after I fall asleep,” she says.  “To awaken” means to wake up or to wake someone else  up.  She wakes up soon after she falls asleep.  “To fall asleep” means t o begin to sleep: “I fell asleep last night at 11:30 p.m.”  Stevie says, “then I to ss and turn all night.”  The expression “to toss and turn” means to move your body; fi rst you lie on your left, then you lie on your right.  You keep moving back and for th because you can’t fall asleep, that’s to toss and turn. 

Stevie says that Patrick also talks in his sleep.  “To talk in your sleep” means to start saying things even though you are unconscious – even th ough you are sleeping.  This can be very dangerous, especially if you’re d reaming about your former girlfriend, for example, or boyfriend, or dog – if your dog is in the room where you are sleeping, for example!  Luis says, “Wow, tha t’s terrible.  I’d make a beeline for some sleeping pills, if I were you.”  “I’d make a beeline for” means I would go directly to something without any hesitation.  “To make a beeline for (something)” means to go to do something or to go som ewhere right away, without hesitating, without stopping, to do it immedi ately.   

Luis says, “(I would immediately get) some sleeping pills.”   “Sleeping pills” are drugs that help you sleep.  Stevie says, “I took some (I t ook some sleeping pills) one night last week (meaning last week – one night in  the last week), but I woke up groggy and disoriented.”  “To be groggy” (groggy) m eans that you are very tired; usually you just woke up and you’re not mentally a wake yet, you’re not able to move or think normally.  This happens, too, sometimes i f you take a certain drug; the drug could make you groggy – could make you sleep y, could make you not as alert as you would be otherwise.  “To be disorien ted” means to not know where you are or what is happening, to be confused.  If  someone spins you around very fast or gives you a certain drug, you might  become disoriented: you’re not sure where you are, what you’re doing here,  what is going on. 

Stevie says, “I’d rather have insomnia than load up on dr ugs.”  She prefers, she says, she’d rather have insomnia.  “Insomnia” is the inabil ity to sleep during the nighttime or most nights.  Insomnia: not able to sleep .  “To load up on (something)” means to have, to use, to eat, or to bu y a lot of something.  “I’m going to load up on pasta when I go the grocery store”  – I’m going to get lots and lots of pasta because I love pasta.  I do, I really do!  I’m going to load up on it. The word “load” has several different meanings in Engl ish however, so take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions. 

Stevie says that she’d rather have insomnia than load up o n drugs.  Luis says, “Have you tried waking him up when he snores or talks in h is sleep (have you tried waking Patrick up)?”  “To wake (someone) up” mean s to make a noise or do

 something so that they stop sleeping.  Stevie says, “I trie d that one night, but he just ended up sleepwalking!”  “He just ended up…” means t he final result was…, what happened after I did that was…; in this case, he e nded up sleepwalking. “To sleepwalk” means to get out of your bed and to start  walking, even though you are still sleeping.  You don’t usually remember thi s after you wake up.  That is sleepwalking. 

Luis says, “Geez, what are you going to do?”  “Geez,” here , just is an expression of surprise or, in this case perhaps, confusion.  Stevie says, “I wish I knew,” meaning I don’t know, I wish I did know.  Luis says, “It’s a little early in your marriage for separate bedrooms, but I wouldn’t rule i t out.”  Luis is saying that maybe you should sleep in different rooms although you j ust got married, so it’s a little early for that.  He says, however, he wouldn’t ru le it out.  “To rule (something) out” is to decide not to do something, to d ecide that something is not an option.  I’m not going to do that in the future,  I’m not even going to consider it – I’m going to rule it out.  “Rule” has several diffe rent meanings, also, in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some additiona l explanations. 

Finally, Stevie says, “I’ll keep it in mind.”  “To keep (so mething) in mind” means I will consider it, I will not forget about it.  “If I don’t get a good night’s sleep soon,” she says, “separate bedrooms will be the least of our pr oblems!” meaning we will have more serious problems than just sleeping in differen t rooms. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
