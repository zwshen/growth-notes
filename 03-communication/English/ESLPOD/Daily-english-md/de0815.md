This episode is about buying some new things to eat  with, what we would call “dinnerware.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  We need some new dinnerware. Nearly all of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.

Jason:  All right, you do that.

Wendy:  Aren’t you going to help?

Jason:  I trust your judgment. Whatever you like, I ’ll like, too.

Wendy:  But I need your input. For instance, this s et has eight place settings: eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, eight soup  bowls, and eight mugs. Everything is microwave-safe, too. What do you thin k of this pattern?

Jason:  It’s great. Let’s get that one.

Wendy:  Wait! This set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter. It has a nice blue pattern , see?

Jason:  Yeah, it’s perfect. Let’s buy that one.

Wendy:  Oh, but look at these other options on this  website. I don’t think I can decide unless I can see them in person. Let’s go.

Jason:  Go where?

Wendy:  To the store. I don’t want to buy something  half-assed. We’ll be using these dishes for many, many years.

Jason:  Like I said, I trust your judgment. Buy wha tever you want.

Wendy:  You’re not coming with me? Come on. What ca n I do to get you to come with me?

Jason:  You want me to go with you shopping on my d ay off and while the game is on? Dream on!

[end of dialogue]

Wendy begins our dialogue by saying to Jason, “We n eed some new dinnerware.” “Dinnerware” (dinnerware), one word, i ncludes plates, bowls, cups, silverware, a knife, a spoon, a fork – all of the t hings that you use what we would call the “dishes” to eat a meal. “Dinner” of course  is one of the three meals during the day: breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, a nd dinner in the evening.

Wendy says, “Nearly all, almost all, of our plates and bowls are cracked or chipped.” To be “cracked” (cracked) here means to h ave little lines through it. It's broken but it isn't completely broken. You could ha ve a glass with a crack in it. You would see a little line in the glass indicating  that it might break completely soon. To be “chipped” (chipped) means there's a lit tle hole or a little bit of the object that is missing. Usually this happens with a  piece of glass or other material, hard material, and there’ll be sort of li ke a little hole in it, not completely, not going through it, but just on the outside, on the surface of it. We would say that is chipped.

Jason says, “All right, you do that,” meaning yes, you go and get some new dinnerware. Wendy says, “Aren't you going to help ( you lazy husband!)?” Well, she just says, “Aren't you going to help?” Jason sa ys, “I trust your judgment.” To “trust someone’s judgment” means that you believe that whatever this person does will be right. They will do the right thing. S o, you're not going to go with them or help them. You don’t need to. You say to th em, you do what you think is right and I'm sure that will be just fine with me. He says, “Whatever you like, I'll like, too.” This, of course, is what all husbands want to do when their wives ask them to help them buy things for the house, for exa mple. You know, I really don’t care what color the table is or what kind of rug we  have. Just go ahead, buy it. If

you're happy, I'm happy. That’s what Jason is sayin g – not me, Jason! Jason says, “Whatever you like, I'll like, too.”

Wendy says, “But I need your input.” “Input” (input ) means your opinion about how to do something. We might also use the word “fe edback” (feedback). Wendy says, “For instance, this set has eight place setti ngs.” “For instance,” meaning for example, this set, this collection of plates or din nerware has eight place settings. A “place setting” is what one person sitting down a t the table would need to eat with, so it would be a cup, a plate, a fork, a spoo n, a knife and so forth. Each one of those would be a place setting.

Wendy says, “This set of dishes has eight place set tings,” so enough for eight people: “eight dinner plates, eight salad plates, e ight soup bowls, eight mugs.” A “dinner plate” is a large plate where you can put u sually all of the main dish, the “entrée,” we would say, the main course for your me al. A “salad plate” quite obviously is a smaller plate used for eating “salad ,” a mixture of small pieces of vegetables usually when we talk about it in an Amer ican context, a salad. A salad plate is smaller than a dinner plate. Wendy also sa ys, “This set of place settings has eight soup bowls.” A “bowl” is a small containe r that you use to put something in, usually liquid, often liquid. In this  case, it's a bowl for eating, of course, soup.

Wendy says, “Everything is microwave-safe, too.” To  be “microwave-safe” means that you can put in a microwave and you won't damag e it, you won't hurt it. You know sometimes you put things in a “microwave,” whi ch is a special little oven that heats not using a flame, a fire or some sort of hot piece of metal, but it heats food using microwaves, a special kind of radiation really. Well, if you put some things in a microwave oven, sometimes they can melt  or you can hurt them. You can damage them. These plates, however, according to Wendy, are microwave- safe meaning it's okay, it won't damage the plates and the bowls.

Wendy says, “What do you think of this pattern?” A “pattern” (pattern) is a decoration, usually a repeating design of colors or  shapes on an object, so you might have a shirt that has lines that go up and do wn, black and white lines – that would be a pattern, kind of a strange pattern, but it would be a pattern. Or you might have a dress that has flowers on it, small li ttle flowers on it, that flower pattern repeats itself, so you have one, two, three , and then next to that you have three more flowers and so forth. That’s the pattern .

Wendy asks Jason what he thinks of the pattern. Jas on says, “It's great. Let's get that one.” Let's buy that one. Wendy says, “Wait! T his set is a little more formal and the plates are bigger, about an inch larger in diameter.” So Wendy says,

“Oh, wait a minute, there's this other set of dishe s. It's a little more formal.” It's perhaps for more formal kinds of dinners, maybe whe n you have your boss over to your house for dinner. The plates are bigger, ab out a half an inch larger – I'm sorry, an inch larger in “diameter” (diameter). Dia meter is the distance across a circle, the length of the line that goes through the center of a circle and touches both sides of a circle. You learned about that back  in geometry when you were in school, and if you didn’t well, you can read a man named Euclid, an old Greek who wrote all about it.

Wendy says, “It has a nice blue pattern, see?” Jaso n says, “Yeah, it's perfect. Let's buy that one.” Jason, of course, doesn’t care . He just wants to make the decision and be done with it. Wendy, however, says,  “Oh, but look at these other options on this website.” She’s showing him more ex amples of dinnerware. “I don’t think I can decide unless I see them in perso n,” that is, unless I actually go to a store and see them, not just look at them on the internet. She says, “Let's go.” Jason says, “Go where?”

Wendy says, “To the store. I don’t want to buy some thing half-assed.” To do something “half-assed” (half-assed) means not to do  a very good job at it, to attempt it, but not to be very serious about it. Th is expression is a vulgar one. I wouldn’t use it, really, myself. I would probably n ever use it, but if you did use it, it would only be in your family or with your spouse. T he word “ass” is a vulgar word, (ass) and so any terms that have that word in  it are probably ones that you don’t want to use very often if at all. Wendy says,  “We'll be using these dishes for many, many years.” “Dishes” is the same as dinnerwa re – the plates, the bowls, and so forth.

Jason says, “Like I said,” like I said before “I tr ust your judgment. Buy whatever you want.” Wendy says, “You're not coming with me? Come on!” – meaning “let's go.” “What can I do to get you to come with me?” Ja son says, “You want me to go with you shopping on my day off, (on a day I don ’t have to work) and while the game is on.” The “game” would be some sporting game : soccer, baseball, football, etc. Jason says, “Dream on.” The word “dr eam” (dream) has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “pa ttern,” which we mentioned earlier. Go to our Learning Guide for some addition al definitions of those two terms. The expression “dream on” or the phrase “dre am on” is an informal, sort of rude, phrase where you are telling a person that wh atever they are asking for or whatever they are hoping for is impossible. It's no t going to happen. “You think you're going to win the lottery and be a millionair e and have a million dollars? Dream on!” I'm saying that’s ridiculous, that’s imp ossible, that’s not going to happen. That’s what Jason is saying to Wendy. He’s not going to go with her to

buy dinnerware on a day where he doesn’t have to wo rk and there is a sport event on the television.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
